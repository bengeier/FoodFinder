{"text":"I have to say they have the BEST crepe EVER!! 
I ordered the Santa crepe;and my friend ordered the strawberry banana crepe. Both were AMAZING!!
I was so full but kept eating
They always have the freshly squeezed juice!
BTW, the staff are GREAT"}
{"text":"We had the Big Boy and Little Bird crepes. My friend and I both agreed that the crepes themselves were good in that they're were very light and crispy, but there was a little too much sauce. I personally didn't like the combination of cold cuts with the crepes. 

The little bird was very heavy with the garlic mayo, however service was very friendly.
The sugar cane juice was alright but very, very sweet."}
{"text":"Food: 5/5
Service: 5/5
Atmosphere: 4.5/5

Food: hot stuff savory crepe (hot Genoa salami, mushrooms, tomatoes, basil, spinach, sun dried tomatoes, harvarti cheese). Crepes was crispy on the outside , yet doughy. Texture reminded me of a crispier version of naan. Very satisfied, portion was perfect for me (similar to 2.5 slices of pizza). The only thing I would have liked more is for it to be a little spicier, but that's only my preference.
Sugar cane juice: fresh pressed sugar cane. It was very refreshing and delicious. So fresh that my cup had too much of the bits from the sugar cane, which I wasn't a fan of. They have sweet crepes too, but I was too full to try.

Service:
Order at the counter and they bring your crepe to your table on this cute little crepe holder. For first timers, they explain how to eat the crepes. Seems like a no brainer, but with the mini lesson, there is less mess. However, even if you make a mess, the staff there is very diligent in cleaning up for you. 

Atmosphere:
Small clean place with three tables of two. Not meant for people to sit there for too long, although I did. But they didn't seem to mind too much since most people just ordered and ate elsewhere or ate quickly. I went on a Friday afternoon, and they had consistent flow of patrons throughout lunch until 2 or 3. 

Definitely coming back to try the other savory and sweet crepes and their watermelon juice."}
{"text":"My typical Friday daddy time with my son.  I don't usually write reviews but my 9 yrs old enjoys it so much that he wants me to give it 5 stars and write a review with pics!!!

Crepes are fabulous, ingredients are fresh and made in front of you, brought to your table within minutes.  Needless to say my son inhaled the crepe and finished my sugar cane juice, which added some lemon juice to give a fresher taste and not as sweet as just sugar cane juice.

At this time he is still hovering the counter wanting more!!!"}
{"text":"Friendly service but the food is basically like Subway on a crepe. Sugar cane juice is equally overrated, although the staff will try convincing you it cures cancer, wards off evil spirits, and can bring about world peace."}
{"text":"Tried the Monte cristo breakfast crepe. It was delicious. I will definitely be back to try many more!! Yum!!!"}
{"text":"Came here during the weekend with my fiancee. Portions are huge for the price we paid. We were going to order a savory and a sweet for dinner and dessert but was too full after the savory. Excellent customer service from all their staff. You can either pick from their normal menu or customize your own!"}
{"text":"Best savory crepe I've ever had (philly cheese steak crepe) The ingredients are really fresh and the owner is super friendly. Can't forget the sugar cane with mint and lemon so refreshing. Will definitely be coming back to try all the crepes!"}
{"text":"This place is so good. 
Whenever my friends visit me in Thornhill, I take them here. Not one person didn't love it. 

The guys working there are super nice too, and clearly take pride in what they're making."}
{"text":"The day we decided to give Muncheez a try was on a rainy day. We decided to make the drive over based on all the reviews. 

It is a very small cafe with high tables along one side of the wall. Friendly and welcoming when you enter, the premises look very pleasing and you see all the fresh ingredients. We were seated at a nice comfortable table inside the restaurant. While we waited for our food, we watched our crepes being cooked. 

We ordered a New York's own savoury crepe and a Paradise sweet crepe.  I liked the crispness of both crepes. The savoury crepe gets a 5* rating for the taste combination and food quality. The sweet crepe gets a 3.5, well I also make sweet crepes at home and ours was a bit dry. 

Our overall experience rating dropped to a 2.5-3* when we were asked by a staff? if we would move to a smaller table which was beside the garbage bin and just inside of the entrance of the cafe, so that he could accommodate another party that arrived later. 
That action I think you can only ask your family to move to another table because you want to impress and make your paying clientele comfortable, but to ask other cafe clientele to move? I can't say what would have appeased me...perhaps offer me a comp tea while I sit close to the door. It can be that simple. After they moved us, and we got our food, they left us on our own. Service finito. 

Then as we were leaving, the same staff asked how did we hear about this place, and we had Yelped. He asked us to write a review on Yelp!"}
{"text":"Delicious crepes, with so many different varieties!! Or you can create your own if you have any dietary restrictions. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Delicious crepes.We need to go back and try them all. The owner is very nice, he came to talk to us and we congratulated him on a good job. Not easy to find but it's worth it."}
{"text":"I was so thrilled when this place opened up near my work. The staff there are so friendly and they always put the freshest ingredients into their crepes. They are consistent, well priced, and have a ton of delicious varieties. Their ingredients always pair so well together. They also have delicious sugar cane and watermelon juices which are so unique. Not to mention, the decor and vibes of this place are awesome. A must try!!"}
{"text":"Wow! The crepes are super delicious, carefully made from scratch, very friendly staff -- we are visiting Toronto for 2 weeks, and discovered this gem during our first few days and keep coming back --please open a place in New York one day :-)"}
{"text":"Crepes are perfect here. Try the spicy mother nature! They give it the perfect crisp too. And some champagne tea! Really addicted to this place now. 5 stars for the service too"}
{"text":"Best crepes in Canada ever. Customer service is great and food again is very delicious. All the workers there are very nice. I recommend this to everyone. Now on Friday and Saturday nights they are open till 4am!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem! Wonderful savory and sweet crepes. Friendly staff and while it's a small-scale they're very accommodating of families with young kids. The kids love the fresh watermelon juice."}
{"text":"This place is the best. I don't even go to other crepe places ever since I started coming here! I always order smoked nemo, the crepe itself is a bit crunchy, not burnt. The fillings just all go really well together and they don't go cheap on their fillings, and of course you can customize it if you don't want certain things in your crepe! Staff are always nice and friendly. I got take out crepe from here often and let me tell ya, the crepe still tastes very good after 30 mins in the box!"}
{"text":"This is an excellent, out of the ordinary place. We had savory (mother nature) sweet (elvis) and sugarcane juice (with mint/lemon and mint/lemon/ginger). Everything was fresh tasting and delicious. Will come again"}
{"text":"These crepes are good and just like all the other reviews it deserves that 5 star rating. I do want to mention the A+ customer service in walking you through the different selection of deli, toppings and sauces. The staff are truly appreciate and genuine folks which made it a wonderful experience.

Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Great crepes.  We tried the sweet and savoury ones, and both were exceptional.  The kids really enjoyed choosing from the variety of toppings. Service is excellent, and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"OH how I want to give this place a single star!  I want to keep this place a secret so that the lineups are short when I show up hungry!  

Why reiterate what other posters have said and I don't typically give out 5 stars willy-nilly.  Yes, the food is served fresh and you see all the backup ingredients in the fridge.  Yes, the crepes are filled to the max and delicious.  Yes, the kitchen and decor is clean.  And yes, the staff are good looking and extremely friendly.  They are a creperie and they do not disappoint!  

I ordered the New York crepe, the spicy mustard had the perfect amount of horseradish that put a tear to my eye, literally.  I would definitely head back, but for those reading my post, I advise you to stay away!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here three times, so far, and we are definitely planning to go again and again.  It all started when I went through Yelp to uncover the best rated restaurants close to us (at the time) and Muncheez came up.  Skeptical as I typically am, I didn't quite believe the 'hype' that I read in the many reviews, but I am happy to say, that Muncheez did not disappoint.  Everything we've ordered has been delicious!  The medley of ingredients in combinations that I would never have dreamed of, has been incredible.  Also, no crepe creation would be complete without the satisfying addition of a fresh cup of sugar cane juice.  

Although it is a small establishment, Muncheez is big on taste, originality, and great service!  Do yourself a favor and check them out for yourself."}
{"text":"The sugar cane juice with lime and Mint is out of this world. AMAZING! I've never tasted anything like it. The crepe was so delicious. I got the banana Nutella walnut and it was just perfect. They totally mastered making the crepe. Texture,thickness,crispness, softness.....perfect balance. So good"}
{"text":"Really friendly staff makes for a great experience. They've got a good vibe with fun decor. The crepes are very tasty (I had the smoked Nemo), and there's a lot of interesting sounding options. Will definitely be coming back here!"}
{"text":"Blew my mind... As promised. Really wanted sweet, but I hadn't had dinner and was persuaded in to savoury by the owner. It didn't let me down!! So yum. I will be back!"}
{"text":"No frills spot right here!

The owner is very welcoming and helps you understand their menu and what to order if it's your first time. The savory crepes are delicious, I had the Elvis and it was phenomenal.

Sugar Cane juice : As someone who grew up chewing on cane the juice was not as sweet as I was expecting but it was very refreshing. I decided to add the mint and lemon shot to it which made a great paring.

You've gained a loyal customer!"}
{"text":"Nice little place for take away. Wings tasted great and the lady at the counter was sweet and patient."}
{"text":"Need one on every corner! The staff are very friendly, really good vibes. The Crepes are delicious, and its safe to say im addicted."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place is not a franchise yet (if there was one closer to my house I would likely go there everyday). They have such an incredible concept and it's truly something you can't get anywhere else. The turkey crepe is divine! I really like that you can personalize your crepes and their sauces just blend all the flavours beautifully. The staff and owners are extremely nice and the whole atmosphere is very creative and positive. In terms of the price, you almost feel like it's a bargain for what you're getting. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The crepes are amazing at this restaurant and the staff remember your name and genuinely treat you like family.  If you want a life changing experience come here and you won't be able to deny your love for the crepes.  Sugarcane juice with strawberries is also amazing, it took me a while to try it but I'm very glad I did.  Never stop guys and Maria! ! It's just too good! See you soon."}
{"text":"You must try for yourselves! I had an amazing first experience today. Their customer service was top of the line. Staff were friendly and helpfull. The food was delicious. The sugarcane drink was delightfully refreshing. Looking forward to go back again soon. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great place to visit. Great atmosphere friendly staff and super tasty. We enjoyed the savory crepes very filling and we had to take one extra crepe home for desert and we enjoyed that too plus the freshly squeezed sugar cane and the fresh watermelon was so refreshing. Must visit A+++++."}
{"text":"Excellent on all levels. A little expensive for lunch but arguably well-earned in terms of quantity and quality. Tried a sweet crepe because I wanted to try something small and cheap but would def try a savoury one next time."}
{"text":"Just came back from this place. There were four of us, but two of us came a little later. The interior was nice and hip but it was also small and there were not a whole lot of seating area. There were two sets of seating area for four people and about three sets of seating area for two. We had to wait until this lady moved out of her spot from one of the four-seat tables but thankfully she did before the rest of us made it.

While we were waiting, a lady behind the counter greeted us and asked if it was our first time here. When we told her that it was, she asked if we want her to go through the menu. She went over them briefly, but we didn't learn anything special that we might not have known by looking through the menu. She also asked if we needed help with anything when we just sat there waiting for our friends but was cool with it when we told her we were waiting for two more people.

We ordered two Li'l Birds (spicier version for me), one Mother Nature, and one Mouthfull, with sugar cane juice for each of us. When we were having trouble deciding what to add in our juice, the lady gave us a small sample of strawberry sugar cane juice for each of us. Two of us ended up getting regular, while one got lemon and I got mint.

The savoury crêpes were, well, savoury, warm, delicious, and surprisingly filling. Not like that crêpe place I went to on Queen Street. The friend who ordered Mouthfull (a sweet one) said it was also good. The Li'l Bird I had with jalapeño tasted almost like a delicious slice of pizza with fluffier bread. The lady also told us how to remove the crêpe holder as she brought our crêpes so that we can eat them more conveniently. Sugar cane juices were also good. As someone who doesn't like overly sweet things, the strawberry sample was too sweet and I'm glad that I chose mint. It's not super sweet and the taste of mint is not overpowering. You can even see actual mint leaves in there! The gentleman who brought our drinks recommended that for the flavoured ones, we stir them a bit before we drink them.

Overall, friendly staff, cozy environment, and awesome taste makes this one of my best discoveries. The only reason why I didn't give a five-star rating was because it was a bit pricy for me (especially the drinks - the whole thing ended up costing over $60 for the four of us). I feel like the crêpes are about equal value fprthe money while sugar cane juices are not - they seem like slightly better-tasting sugar water. While this is a nice place to catch up with a few friends, it's definitely too small for a large group."}
{"text":"Fresh deli. Delicious savoury flavours. Excellent taste. Highly recommended! Smoked salmon is bomb. 
Service is 100%"}
{"text":"Service and food were incredible.  Wouldn't be shocked to see this place with a line up out the door.  Definitely a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Aside from the orgasmic food and the soul nourishing, freshLy squeezed juices, the overall experience is one that will have you back twice within the week!
First thing I say when you walk in: \"hi\"
Second thing you say: \"GIMME THAT GODDAMN SUGAR-CANE JUICE RAMIN!!!\" ;-)"}
{"text":"We decided to pop in for a quick dinner before a party and I'm really glad we did. We had Big Bird, Philly Cheesesteak, and two Torontos, and we were all super-pleased.

I think that 5-star rating after 100 reviews says it all -- the quality of the food and service is above reproach.

The one thing I would emphatically share is that Muncheez is tucked away in what seems to be the courtyard of a condo/mall complex. Siri told me we'd arrived but there was no Muncheez in sight; I had to take a side street into a parking lot and there it was... definitely worth the hunt, though!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and food here. The almost perfect ratings on yelp are there for a reason. The owner of the restaurant is super helpful and friendly. The crepes, especially their savoury crepes, have excellent flavour combinations. Will be returning for sure."}
{"text":"Had to try this place after hearing many good things about it and glad I did. No disappointments to talk about as the visit was a total success! The workers were very helpful and very customer oriented. They would deliver the crepe right to your waiting table. It is a small space placed within a somewhat hidden plaza. Parking can be frustrating but worth the effort in going.

They have a wide selection of set crepes to order, as well as a build your own feature. Girlfriend and I chose the set route as this was our first time (definitely not last)

I could eat the crepe itself layer upon layer but what's the fun in that when they pack so much goodies inside. 

Mouthfull - sweet crepe with Banana, Strawberry and Blueberry

B.L.T. - the works + Havarti Cheese and Mayo! 

Under $15 

Bon Appetit!"}
{"text":"I love this place for their food and great customer care. 
Sugar cane juice with mint and lime a must try."}
{"text":"Hip joint, cool owners, and a decent location for Thornhill residents. The food is really good. The crepes are tasty, hot, and crunchy yet soft. The Philly Cheese Steak crepe was tasty. It was pretty unrelated to the infamous Philly Cheese Steak sandwich, but it is a good experience nonetheless. I'll make sure to ask that they go easy on the BBQ sauce, they were a bit too generous. 

Great place, and super awesome people. I'm going again."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic. I will be revisiting very soon. 
I wish there was one north of the city like in the Markham Stouffville area. Hint hint."}
{"text":"Just found this unique little eatery tonight. Really glad we did! Super fresh savoury crepes made to order. Gotta try 'Hot Stuff' - extremely tasty, and best washed down with their signature fresh pressed sugar cane juice - a nice combination... Better still is the upbeat service, full of interest and genuine enthusiasm. Thanks again guys! Great attitude!"}
{"text":"I don't like the stupid glass in the restaurant very impersonal on my second visit I got a steak philly combo which already $9 the lady charged me $1.50 just to add steak sauce which was petty , in addition the steak sandwich was greasy will NEVER go back!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Good food with good people serving you. The savoury and sweet crepes are to die for! Dont forget to these with a cup of high quality Ethiopian coffee or freshly squeezed sugar cane juice."}
{"text":"Not only was the food hot and tasty, but te service was by far superb and made this establishment wonderful. The only drawback would be the limited seating, but it means you have to get here early!"}
{"text":"Great food! Ingredients are nice and fresh and place is clean! You can tell they take pride in what they do. Staff were super friendly and helpful with the menu as well. Best crepe place in Toronto. We had the create your own, pear pie and Mt Fuji. Would definitely come back. Thanks for a great meal!"}
{"text":"I have been to Muncheez twice.  Had a little bird and the New York deli one.
Both were so amazing.  This is going down as one of my favorite hand held foods ever.  They fold a crepe into a samdwich or vice Versa I don't know. I just know it tastes amazing and is made with fresh ingredients in front of me.
I am a regular 4 life.
The crepe is so lite and delicate and delicious yet somehow holds this whole thing together as an awesome amazing deli sandwich.  Warm deli sandwich do even better.

An added attraction is the pure sugar cane juice.  So delicious for any time of year not just summer, it's great with their sandwiches.   So novel, this place rocks."}
{"text":"I had the steaks and egg crepe. Wonderful! The crepe was soft, thin and light with a slight crisp at the edges. They accommodated my request for no cheese without question and even offered to substitute other ingredients at no cost. Service was friendly and the place was clean. My wife loved her Pear Pie crepe and she's anxious to return. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and have never been disappointed. Great savoury crepes. These are more filling than most crepes you get in other places and are absolutely delicious. They also have really good coffee.

Service is very attentive and friendly. Also the crepe peelable cardboard holders make it really easy to eat a crepe on the go without utensils. Love it overall and will make it a regular spot."}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to try out this place! 
I ordered two crepes, one savoury (Mama Mia) and sweet (El Paradiso), and I would say I'm blown away by both, esp. the savoury one :D Mama Mia was really satisfying and delicious. The staffs were very welcoming as well.

I came pretty late, so there was only another group of people there and there was no waiting and it was quiet. 
Will come back to try out all the other savoury/signature crepes and to get my stamps for free 10th crepe!"}
{"text":"Great place in general, easily the best crepe place in Toronto. Other reviews already covered the food so I'll cover what I think makes me come back to this place on a pretty much daily basis.

It's run by the owners and they don't have a lot of other staff so it's in their best interest to provide good service which they always do.

They are happy to make crepes the way you like them, so if you want it well done or without specific ingredients just let them know. The best part about this place is that you can talk to the owners and they will listen, their recipes are flexible and they are aiming to please their customers not to follow the dictates of a specific brand like Tims or Starbucks. 

They are not trying to re-invent the wheel or do anything crazy special, just make crapes and make them well. Bottom line, if you want something ask for it, talk to the owners and they are happy to accommodate you, something that is very rare now a days outside of super pricey restaurants. 

The place is small so big parties will not have a great time but there's plenty of space outside during the summer which is nice. Parking is annoying but plentiful in the underground at the mall if you are driving.

I'm also a big fan of their tea, coffee and sugarcane juice."}
{"text":"fresh, unique, and delish! all the 5 star reviews are no joke, i ate here for lunch 5 days straight while i was in town and staying in North York. best meal you can get for the price no doubt. i liked it so much that i was trying to convince the owner to bring Muncheez to Cali!"}
{"text":"One of the best crepe places in Toronto! They use the freshest ingredients. Must try their freshly squeezed sugar cane juice too!"}
{"text":"A very cozy place to have a quick bite... Delicious crepes... Good customer service..."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved my experience here. Staff is so friendly and attentive. Walked me through the entire process. I typically don't eat crepe but after reading all the reviews, I had to give it a try. Would definitely be coming back here again."}
{"text":"Service is excellent, to the point where staff can remember you even on a second visit. They always initiate conversation and you can feel it's genuine, not just a generic \"have a good day\". 
 The food is great, the ingredients are of a good quality and delicious. The only reason it's not a 5 is due to lack of comfortable seating inside."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing crepes, I had the mother nature savoury one which was absolutely fantastic! Would definitely get again. Beware of the New York crepe as a couple of my friends ordered those and found the mustard to be veeery spicy. Highly recommended for small groups 2-4 (there isnt much sitting space)."}
{"text":"Their fresh squeezed sugar cane juice is so yum. My friend recommended this place to me. I'm in love with it. Everything is made fresh on spot. All staff there are super nice. They make me feel like home here."}
{"text":"Food here: Loved it. Absolutely Delicious!!! 

Service: Such a friendly staff from the moment you walk in. Very helpful with first timers and even after you pay and get your food, they still come back to check on you!

Even though this place is out of the way for me, I definitely will be visiting the area just for their food!"}
{"text":"I went here with my boyfriend for late night dessert. You can get massive super fresh meat crepes or you can get sweet crepes that are perfect and refreshing. The place was so cute, decorated really nicely, and I was super impressed with the ingredients and the prices, so cheap for how much you get and the quality of ingredients!! They have their own deli right in front of you they use to make your crepe. I got the old school with strawberries, and the honey was so natural and not too sweet. My boyfriend got the Philly Cheese steak, as well as a Nutella/banana/walnut crepe. 
We left feeling really satisfied but not weighed down or heavy. The owner was really sweet and came over to ask how everything was. Great concept, and we will be back. Highly recommend, delicious and everything is freshly prepared. We will come back to try their breakfast crepes!"}
{"text":"Good crepes and the sugar cane juice is awesome. I will bring a jar to fill it with sugar cane juice and bring it home lol"}
{"text":"My friend wanted to check out this place based on its review on Yelp and I'm so glad we did. 

When we got there, it was pretty quiet and we were the only ones there. (More people showed up after we order) The two staff working greeted us and the male staff member was super helpful. As it was our first times there, and he asked if it was, he explained the menu and suggested the savoury crepes, which they are known for. 

My friend ordered the Philly Cheese Steak and I got New York's Own. The female staff member suggested their watermelon drink which was pretty delicious and tasted like summer in a cup.

Watching our order being made was pretty cool, I've seen a lot of crepes been made before but this was a little different and pretty interesting.

When our order was ready, the male staff member explained how to rip/eat from holder which was nice.

Taste wise, both were delicious and I'd definitely come back here! The mustard on the New York's Own is delicious and I could have eaten that for days. 

The male staff even asked how it was and told us to have a nice night on our way out. So kudos to him for his great customer service and attention to detail!

I actually posted a photo of our meal on Instagram later and Muncheez, liked and commented it. To me, that's awesome as it shows a business that actually keeps up with it's social media presence.

Definitely check this place out, good customer service and delicious food!"}
{"text":"Seeing as Muncheez has a 5-star rating after 200+ reviews, I had high expectations. I thought it was good, but not amazing.

Food: I got the savoury Tap Out crepe. As many people have said, the ingredients are very fresh, and I really like that they don't skimp out. They really do give you your money's worth of toppings! The crepes are served piping hot and are very filling. I'm just not sure the taste of the crepe itself is that amazing. The pastrami overpowered a lot of the other flavours and became a little too heavy towards the end. Don't get me wrong, it's still a good crepe, just not that special.

Drinks: their sugar cane juice on the other hand, was fantastic! The owner recommended to have it with some lemon and mint, making it taste almost mojito-like. Very refreshing and I definitely recommend. Again, they don't cheap out. They put in a decent amount of mint leaves and filled the cup above the brim! (see photo)

Service: everyone who works there is very friendly and welcoming. Took the time to explain their menu since it was my first time there. We didn't wait long for our crepes, but it was also pretty empty when we went at around 1pm on a Sunday. It's a small space so don't come with a big group and expect to find enough seating.

In short, good quality crepes, fantastic sugar cane juice, and good value for your money. Am I dying to come back? No, but if I'm in the neighbourhood and looking for a good lunch, yeah I'd stop by."}
{"text":"Went to Muncheez Deli Creperie for the first time today for lunch. The place is clean, the ingredients fresh, the people friendly and the food DE-LISH!!!

The restaurant is located behind (east of) the Liberty Suites building. There's plenty of free parking underground as well as above ground. If you park underground, come out the main entrance of the Shops on Yonge and turn right. 

We ordered three types of Savory Crepes: Philly Cheese Steak, Big Bird, & Santa's Omelette and two Sweet Crepes: Mouthful & Marshberry. We also had the watermelon and sugar cane juice. The sugar cane juice is a must try. It's made fresh and has many health benefits. 

The Savory Crepes all came out piping hot and were so tasty. The Philly has a great balance of flavours. There is a hint of horse radish in the Big Bird which gives it a nice kick. And when your in the mood for eggs, you can't go wrong with Santa's Omelet. 

The Mouthful is packed full of strawberry, banana & Nutella and oh so good!  The Marshberry has blueberry, strawberry & marshmallows and is not too sweet. My son devoured his Marshberry and my daughter loved hers but it really was a \"mouthful\" so she couldn't finish hers! Lol. 

The paper wrap the crepes come in are perforated so you peel the paper away as you eat. Nice and easy. The crepes are made in front of you so it's not soggy and there is no skimping on the ingredients!!

Ramen and Raz are super nice people, and made us feel right at home. Seating is very limited, so it cannot really accommodate a large party. We didn't know this as it was our first time so we had seven in our party. Ramen was so accommodating and rearranged tables for us so we did end up eating at the restaurant quite comfortably but we took up a big chunk of the little space that was available.  If you can take your order to go, that would be my recommendation. They have a takeout menu which I've posted pictures of and with the crepes nicely packed in their individual paper wraps, it's easy to take it to go. If we have another big party, will be calling ahead and taking our order to go in the future. 

I'm SUPER happy to have found this gem in the 905 so I don't have to trek all the way downtown to get crepes. I will be back for sure and can't wait to try all the other items on their menu!!  Bon Appetite!!"}
{"text":"Went there for a late lunch.  Empty at the time.  Service was great, tried their new special, tasted amazing.  Pricey, it was. $12 one, but good.  Other ones seem to start at $8.50.  Good stuff.  Which it was closer to my work place.

Only downside to this would be the wait time if you come at a busy time."}
{"text":"Excellent crepes. Very good friendly service. This place is a jewel ! Love all the fresh ingredients and menu suggestions. Sugar cane juice was very yummy too."}
{"text":"Facility: Located in the Shop on Yonge plaza (on the inside stores, not in the mall). Parking is pretty sparse but on a Sunday afternoon we didn't have a problem finding a spot.

Inside, the establishment is TINY. Seats about 8 - 10 people (2 people tables and one 4 person table, but it's a squeeze) so I suppose it's meant more for take-out. Decor is cute but I really wish they had more seating. Tables have purse hooks which is nice. No washroom is visibly available, you'll have to go into the mall. The small space is probably what lost this place a star for me and took away from the 5-star experience.

CP24 is on mute in the corner and there is some light music in the background.

Food Quality & Price: Each crepe is priced between $8.50 - $12. They are NOT stingy on the toppings which I greatly appreciated. Hopefully they won't crank the prices up later or start going easy on the toppings. Stay strong, Muncheez! I was very pleased with the savory menu. Prices are reasonable and fair. We shared the Lil Bird sans olives and it was very pleasant but I would say that one crepe is enough for one person. Splitting it doesn't seem to be filling enough. The sweet crepe menu seems pretty boring and kind of repetitive. Most with Nutella, some fruit or nuts. Most creative was probably the El Paradiso (which I ordered) with Nutella, avocado and marshmellows. It was sublime! 

I also tried the Sugar Cane drink that other Yelpers have recommended. Things like mint or lemon are additional fees. I ordered mint in mine and wish there were more leaves in it. To me, the sugar cane drink is just a tad too pricey and I don't think I'll order it again. $6 not including taxes and additions is pretty steep. 

Oddly, there are a lot of deli meat options on the menu but at least they have a great \"Make your own\" option where you can choose your own protein, sauce and toppings. $8.50 is a smart pricepoint. It's good enough to profit, but not as greedy as other chains like Crepelicious or Demetres. Their price and heftiness keeps Muncheez competative. Crepes are folded in a \"triangle\" or \"flattened cone\" in side a cone cup with a flat cone cardboard layer which can be peeled at a dotted line. So eating the crepe on the go is NEAT AND TIDY.

Service: Was great. If I could grade it, it would be an A-. Slightly above expectations, but not exceptional. If you eat in, crepes are brought to your table (you don't have to go get it). The hostess will clean off the table if someone leaves. Service with a smile, mostly. I waited about 5 minutes for each of my crepes which is fair turn around time. Owner says hello and goodbye to everyone, so many people feel warm and welcomed. Several seem like repeat and returning customers.

Overall: I can definitely tell that the owner has thought many of the details through and carefully considered the perspective of his customers. He is also quite active on Yelp I believe, and most of the customers that come in are asked how they know about Muncheez. Everyone that was there when I was, answered Yelp (as did I). So I'm sure that the owner knows that Yelp is quite key to the success of his business. He also asks people to review Muncheez on Yelp. I didn't get a chance to ask the owner his name, but he was quite friendly to most people coming through the door. My husband and I are quiet, so it's fair to say that we slipped his radar. Nevertheless, I liked that they didn't necessarily know that I review a lot on Yelp because consistent experience is key.

It looks like Muncheez is starting out strong because the owner really cares about his business and it shows. I will definitely be returning and if my rating ever changes, I can come back and adjust it. Maybe they can even open up another location further east uptown. We are sorely missing good crepe places in Markham! 

Muncheez earns a solid 4 star out of 5 for being great for return business."}
{"text":"This is 4.5 stars. I do not give out 5 stars lightly. I checked and there were only 5 others.

I don't like the location. Of course, I'd prefer it closer to my house, but Yonge and Steeles is often busy and it was hard to find parking but I do not hold this against them when reviewing.

I had a book club here and could not make it. I should have did more research because the place might seat 20 people at the most and our usual 7-12 people would have been separated and maybe waiting for seats but I heard it worked out as only 3 showed up which is too bad for the rest of them because this is great stuff.

For me, this is unique. Now that I think about it, I did have a Chinese flavoured crepe-like dish at Pacific Mall but this was a lot better. The restaurant is bright, modern, clean. The customer service is exceptional, very friendly. I like that they have hair nets and/or shaved their heads, but the three that worked when we went all had beards, but they were neatly trimmed so maybe beard nets were not needed.

We actually ordered ahead and were going to eat and drive at the same time, but since there where seats, we decided to relax and enjoy ourselves.

We had the vegetarian Madagascar, one of the signature crepes, and a sugar cane/ginger drink. I didn't mind spending $10.99 for a crepe but I thought $6.50 for a drink was a bit much. The drink was really good. I've had a lot of bubble tea and out of all the $5.00 plus I've spent on a drink, this was one of the best, definitely top one or two. It was not too sweet and very refreshing.

The crepe itself was very well done. The ingredients tasted really fresh and it was delicious. The experience was fun and different and I really want to try some of the other crepes because I really think they could taste quite wonderful. The urge to come back is a lot stronger than other places, where it's, yeah, \"I'd go back if in the area, but maybe I should try some place new\" versus \"oh yeah, I remember that, yeah I'm excited, let's go back.\"

Yesterday, I ate at 100% Korean and that was chaos. This was confident competent clockwork from people who looked like they were enjoying and passionate about what they were doing. That is a nice vibe to have.

One of the few places that lived up to its yelp hype. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Owner was very friendly and explained the process.. took lots of pride in his work! The crepes were 10/10! We got the savoury ones and being vegetarians we felt that there were lots of veggie options, even a build your own option! Will def come again!!!!"}
{"text":"Was skeptical of the 5 star review but after eating there the food speaks for itself. It's made in front of you. Food was a bit hot fresh off the burner, so I had a chat with the friendly staff as it cooled off. Was filling and satisfying, would definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"Delicious! I had the black forest crepe. Every bite is good!"}
{"text":"Came here with my family and I'm a picky eater as I'm pregnant.  The deli meat is nitrite free and they don't grill the meat hot on the pan but immediately after the crepe is made so it's cooked for a good 5 mins. And the crepe came out really hot that I couldn't really hold it in my hand. A little note for the pregnant women out there.  

We had the savory crepe... big boy and lil bird.  They were both very delicious.  This place specializes in the savory crepes. Best savory crepes I've tried. 

We had the dessert crepe. .paradiso... it was good. 

I would rate the savory crepes a 5 and my husband rated the dessert one a 4 but it wasn't his style.  

Had the black coffee and went well with everything. 

Got to come back here. The only downsize would be its not for groups."}
{"text":"Date: April 7, 2016

Purchased: Big Boy (savoury) and the Mouthful (sweet)

It was a weekday in the mid afternoon. It's a cozy place. There's enough seating for about 20 people. The owners are extremely nice and welcoming. Nutella bottles are everywhere!

While looking at the menu and trying to make up my mind, I was offered a sample of the sugar cane juice. It was amazingly fresh and refreshing. I've only tried it in a can before and I didn't like it so much then. This is something I would order the next time I'm there. 

Finally, I decided on my choices. They let me know that you can customize any of the crepes to your liking such as adding or subtracting ingredients  and even cooking the crepe lighter or darker. I was able to watch them prepare everything and cook the crepe. They prepared my savoury first and as I finished they started to prepare my sweet crepe. It was placed in a cardboard cut out and placed in a metal stand. They explain in detail how to properly eat the crepe. 

I was super excited as I took my first bite. It was a well balanced and extremely tasty crepe. Then, I got my sweet crepe and I devoured it. 

I will definitely be back to try the other combinations of crepe!"}
{"text":"Amazing crepes with the best ingredients. I can't even make a decision on which ones are the best but I usually get the savoury ones. They also have a great exotic drink menu. Love the sugarcane juice! The owners look like supermodels so that's just a bonus. I am so happy to see that they are rated super high! Truly deserving of all their success."}
{"text":"The savoury crepes were great, but the freshly made sugar cane juice is the must try!"}
{"text":"While most creperies focus on the sweet (with savoury on the side), Muncheez takes that concept, flips it on his head, and does a pretty damn good job. They have a high focus on healthy and fresh ingredients, and c'mon, who doesn't like a creperie where they literally squeeze fresh sugar canes in front you of you to make juice?! Talk about being unique.

Would highly recommend if you're in the area, will not disappoint!

The Crepe (Big Bird) + Sugar Cane Juice (5/5):  So it's not your typical dine in creperie, where you've got to eat the crepe with fork and knife. These guys make the crepes handy and easy to eat. It's not a stuff and roll, its a let's-layer-meat-&-cheese, then fold, then-spread-vegetables-and-sauce, then fold! This keeps the ingredients inside, well spread throughout the crepe, and easy to eat. Their big bird is their oven roasted turkey breast with avocado, lettuce and spicy mustard (I'm definitely missing more ingredients lol). The crepe comes crisp, straight off the flat top, and they don't skimp on ingredients here, so you're nice a full by the end of the meal. Their spicy mustard packs a punch with each bite, and I'm glad to have ordered their sugar cane juice to wash it all down. Yup, this isn't sugar cane juice from a can, they literally have a bucket of canes and you can watch the juice being squeezed into your cup. It's a sweet drink so beware, but its as fresh as imported costa rican sugar canes can be haha. Next time will definitely try their fresh watermelon juice and another crepe on their menu! 

Cost (4.5/5): Ranging from $8.50 and up, I'd say that it's fair price to pay for a crepe. 

Service (5/5): When I came with my 4 other coworkers, they didn't hesitate to explain their entire menu, and treated every other person coming in with a smile and ready to answer any questions. They take cash, credit, debit, and if you find space to dine in, they will make sure to always check occasionally if you need anything and that you're satisfied :) I wouldn't exactly consider this fast-food, as it does take around 10-15mins to make your crepe, but for 1 guy who is able to make 4 at the time, the wait didn't seem so long since you get to watch them make it :P

Ambience (5/5): Hip and casual! This place has got bang on decor with some flair and about 4 small tables able to sit 2-3 persons each. It's definitely a place meant for take out, but that doesn't stop you from eating in. They've literally got a mini deli where you know your meat is coming from and a large fridge behind them where you can see the vegetables, fruits and sugar canes that you are eating. The 2 guys who served us really promoted a healthy meal, and I feel I can trust them considering how fit they both were.

I think i've said enough good things about this place. The pictures don't do this place justice, just come here and try it out!!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars 

Good grab and go place!  Excellent and friendly customer service!  The owners are super nice!

The crepe paper container is such a cute design, just tear off along the line, no mess at all.

As mentioned by Stephanie R., it's a small place, don't expect to sit down and have a long chat with friends.  Hopefully, one day they will expand their store to have more sitting area.  This is a new store and they will open another location next summer (in 2015) as per the owner. 

Price is reasonable.  

We had Philly Cheese Steak ($8.5)  and Santa's Omelette with hot salami ($8.5); it said $7.5 on their menu but they charged $8.5; I forgot to ask..oh well.  They both very good and yummy.  I tried the crepe itself and I was able to taste a hint of butter, YUM!!! I like it so much because their crepes wouldn't get saggy.   You know how savoury crepes are after a while with sauce... Their crepes hold well.   
 
The reason why I gave them 4.5 stars instead of 5 is, they only serve deli meat.  If you don't like deli like me, they have Mother Nature (black beans, avocado, green peppers, olives, spinach, mushrooms, havarti and pesto: $8.5), create your own crepe and sweet crepes to choose yum... all ingredients are fresh, you can see and taste the freshness.  
 
They also have kale walnut salad and mediterranean quinoa salad.
They have sugar cane juice ($4.99) which squeeze/press right in front of you; it is so fresh!!!

I will go back for sure."}
{"text":"We got the big bird and Santa omelette. Both very good and light. Also try the sugar cane juice, very refreshing."}
{"text":"Incredible crepes, super fresh and made to order. The kids said it was their new favourite restaurant. My daughter's strawberry, black olive, and cheddar cheese crepe was a winner. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Good crepe, but on the pricey side given what you get.

The owner was friendly and helpful. Given the high rating I see on yelp, this business must also be great at marketing."}
{"text":"Amazing place! Been a bunch of times and have been amazed every time. Very happy to have a place like this in the area!"}
{"text":"Great service, polite staff. Warm welcome as soon as we got there. Food was fresh and flavourful. Prices were reasonable. I had the big boy, gf had New York's own.. Both were delicious. Will definitely go back to try some of there others.. Quite impressed with this place and wish them the best of luck. 5/5"}
{"text":"Tried out this place out of the blue (doctors office is across the street). The owners/staff are super friendly, which makes their customer sservice unbelievable. The place is super small, but luckily we got a place to sit and eat. The ingredients are very fresh and the staff is excellent with hygiene standards. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best crepes ever!! Especially the savory ones. Everything was fresh and tasted amazing!"}
{"text":"I have only frequented Muncheez twice. Once a few months after it first opened and last, the summer of this year. Both experiences have been memorable and the food has never disappointed.

Around $9.99 for a savory crepe and $7.99 for a sweet crepe, Muncheez delivers on both spectrums. They are huge and require both hands to eat. The savory crepe selections are unique with the ingredients harmoniously balanced. The crepe itself was slightly crispy but had the elasticity to keep the massive amount of ingredients they stuff inside together. In the summer they offered different sugar cane drinks (we had mint) that were really light, refreshing and delicious!

Not a lot of seating but the staff have been incredibly welcoming both times we were there. They were personable, funny and passionate about their menu. When we said we were dinning in, they delivered our meal and cleaned our table without expecting service charge!

Fantastic little shop at World on Yonge. Highly recommended if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I got their Smoked Nemo and sugar cane juice. So good!!! Great service and everything is fresh. There's 20 minute parking. Will definitely come again and will save room for their sweet crepes."}
{"text":"Very flavorful and filling food. Delightful sugar cane drinks. Wonderful friendly staff.  Please open one in Boston!"}
{"text":"I found this place on Yelp and WOW the 5 star reviews couldn't be more right. I don't think I could say enough good things about this place. The food- excellent!!! The sugar cane drink- amazing and so fresh. The owner- so friendly, knowledgable and obviously passionate about what he does. They make everything right in front of you and it's such a cool atmosphere. It's clear they really focus on the details and it pays off. Try this place now. You will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"I'm back in Toronto & no trip is complete without a stop at Muncheez. Stopped in for a late breakfast this morning & it was better than I remembered. They said they'd made a few changes to the menu since I'd been there but I didn't notice them. It looked just as good as before. Again, great idea, delicious food, & the most pleasant people that you could hope for.  Always a must stop when visiting Toronto."}
{"text":"I used to love this place, but the service killed it for me.  All I ordered were 2 juice drinks, however the server absolutely insisted that I \"prove\" the signature on my credit card receipt was legitimate.  In the thousands of transactions I've paid for via card, never have a been asked such a nonsense comment.  Not even showing my ID was sufficient.

Now, as for the food, it's always been decent.  It's a real shame, because I'd like to support this place.  Maybe if I were guaranteed not to be treated like a criminal for a sub-$20 food purchase, I'd come back."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food, great staff, great atmosphere. I usually opt for takeout cuz there's little seating, but I have no qualms. Lovely local gem we have here"}
{"text":"We Went to Muncheez for late lunch and ordered a \"make your own,\" a Monte Cristo and a Pomme crepe for dessert. It took about 15 minutes to get the food but luckily we got one of the few seats inside. I would not come here planning on getting a seat as it seems to always be very busy. This along with the fact that the location is pretty small means you may be getting takeout.
The crepes were so fresh (they make them right in front of you)  and so was all the ingredients. They were very enjoyable but one does not leave you very full
The customer service was amazing though.  Very polite and energetic, and even went as far as to make sure we knew the proper way to eat what we ordered. 
Overall a great experience and we Will be returning."}
{"text":"Love the food, love the vibe, love the juices (sugar cane pressed for the win). Been coming here since it opened and have reccomended it since."}
{"text":"I came to Muncheez on a Friday afternoon. Located near Yonge and Steeles, the place itself is located in a condo complex. Parking is tight and limited to 20-30 minutes.

When I walked in, I was the only customer, but this shortly changed after I ordered, as swarms of people entered. The staff were friendly and helpful with navigating the large menu. It basically comes down to this. Do you want a savoury or sweet crepe?

I opted for the Madgascar savoury signature crepe. It is vegetarian, and comes with falafel, havarti cheese, corn, lettuce, green peppers, chipotle sauce and other delicious toppings.
Toppings can all be excluded or substituted at request. Everything is made fresh in house, and the crepe was made to order. I like how you can customize your crepe and even add an egg for that extra \"umph\"!

In about 5 minutes I was handed a crepe inside of a cardboard holder served in a metal mold that holds the crepe. It was delicious, jam packed with toppings, and HUGE!

I did not get the sugar cane juice as it was quite expensive, however I understand the costs of having sugar cane imported from Costa Rica. I will try it out in the summertime. The price of crepes are also quite high, ranging from 8-12 dollars. I will visit Muncheez again in the future."}
{"text":"Bless up! Great customer service but the crepes could use a bit more of juicy sauce to send the flavours deep into my stomach so that I can benefit from the rich ingredients that are grown from plants and vegetables, and I love this store...... Like oh my gosh I need to apply there soon, like I'm gunna give me resume in tomorrow, woooooooo oh MoMA I need more MUNCHIEZZZZZZZZZ, hehe goodnight."}
{"text":"My 1st crepe/sandwich combo and it was surprisingly good. Wasn't sure what to expect. I got the turkey sandwich in a crepe and it was sweet and savoury. Also the portion was huge! The prices are reasonable and I debated going to Subway across the way but happy with my choice. Give it a try and splurge! Fresh, delicious and great prices."}
{"text":"Tried it today, good portion and tasted really good. The ingredients are fresh! 
Definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"Long time Yelp user, first time reviewer. 

My second visit to Muncheez and tried their \"Hardcore Crèpe\" and it didn't disappoint.  Quality ingredients and original presentation. 

I forgot my phone at their store and they came out to look for me and gave it back to me!!  Super nice people."}
{"text":"I'm vegetarian and they have one that is really delicious and FRESH, and, Good deal all of it!!!"}
{"text":"Really good, but can't give it perfect because of its terrible location.  No seating, no high chairs, and in the middle of suburbia, Doesn't make a lot of sense to have a place like that, in the location that it is in (away from subway, driving required). 

Actual food is great, and prices are fine.  Would definitely return if there was a better location.  At least have tables outside."}
{"text":"I pretty much signed up for Yelp to write this review, so that says a lot about this place already. Wonder how long before this review is buried beneath a bunch more 5 star reviews. Read on.

Crepes were pretty damn tasty. I had a Big Bird (Basically a Turkey Bacon horseradish crepe) and my friend had a Philly Cheesesteak crepe. They were served piping hot in neat tearaway cardboard wrappers. Crepes were very light, not eggy, not too sweet and quite delicate. Way better than some other crepe places I've tried on Queen street.

Also had the fresh pressed Sugarcane juice. WOW! If you're thinking of coming here you should order this....kinda hard to believe something so delicious can come from squeezing a plant. On a side note, why is this so hard to find in Toronto? People don't know what they're missing!!

There was one thing that made a **** into  ******. THE SERVICE. 

Spoke to one of the owners, Ramin. You can really hear the excitement and passion in his voice when he talked about everything about the place from their proprietary crepe recipe that took several months to nail, the design of the wrappers to their custom built sugarcane juice/presser. You have to give credit to a business that really believes in their product and isn't just trying to make a fast buck.

HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend trying this place out, will be back to try the dessert crepes and the coffee."}
{"text":"Very cool idea of having crepes of lunch, breakfast and desert. They have excellent customer service and very nice people.
All their crepes are rly good. They also have this sugarcane juice that they make from fresh sugarcanes, it seems not ad interesting but its realllyyyyy good!"}
{"text":"Absolutely great place. Very friendly staff, fresh and tasty food. Sugar cane juice is a must try!!! Definitely recommend it to everyone!!!"}
{"text":"Greeted when we walked in and they explained the menu to us. Didn't feel rushed to order and they were super nice through the whole process. 

Food was awesome! Crepe was so filling and stayed hot till the bottom. Compared to other Crepe places, this delivers the most food and flavour for the price. 

Definitely recommend and I'll go back if I'm in the area for sure!"}
{"text":"I had Santa's Omlet. It was very well done. The presentation is great as well as the options available. Will be visiting again for sure to try other goodies!

This business is well managed, clean, smart and refreshing. I predict they will be expanding soon and hope they will keep these fundamentals at core that are making them successful today. 

Seating space is limited but you can always take out and much in your car ;)

Two things up!"}
{"text":"First off, the customer service here was excellent and I did not expect it from such a tiny establishment.  The attendant (possibly the boss) greeted us with a very welcoming smile and explained to me in full of their menu and what they have to offer right off the bat, brought us our order with a smile, followed up in the middle of our meal and ended with a very warm goodbye.

I had a personalized dessert crêpe (blueberry, strawberry, marshmallow and nutella) and it was amazing!!!...  The fruits were fresh, the marshmallow were nice and soft, the shell had a perfect balance of thickness and texture, last but not least, it was sweet but not too sweet!!!

Highly recommended!!!!"}
{"text":"Very crispy crepe, one of a kind! Tasteful and healthy with less sauce inside! Must try! Bad thing is it cannot be shared!"}
{"text":"Smoked Nemo ($11.99 + tax) with smoked salmon, avocado, spinach, Olives, onions, cream cheese. Pleasantly crunchy and full of flavour. Balances really well and none of the ingredients are overwhelming. Really creamy flavour and had a bit of a kick. 

Philly cheese steak ($9.99+ tax) with roast beef, green peppers, onions, mushrooms, arugula, cheddar. Don't let the name decide you however, they actually use ROADT BEEF instead of STEAK. Still works really well together  with the BBQ sauce adding a nice flavour to it, I would recommend the Nemo over this however.

Costa Rican Sugar Cane Juice ($5.99+tax). You can add different flavours on top for +$1. Pretty sweet but also very refreshing. Feels like it's freshly made and was quite thirst quenching.

ASK FOR DRIED CRICKETS to add to your crepe. They're not too flavourful but adds a nice crunch to each bite. They tastes just like sunflower seeds!

Restaurant is a really cozy with nice environment that adds to the experience. Whole store fits around 14 people but it was pretty empty when I was here. Closes really late and the staff was really friendly. Service was fast and food was freshly made in front of us. I'm literally watching her cut my apple right now! 

Overall, on the pricier end came to a total of ~$20."}
{"text":"Love this local crepe place!

My usual go to crepes are usually sweet, but here, I really like the savoury crepes. There are a number of crepes that you can choose from, but if you're like me, you can customize your own! They have ingredients like harvati, arugula and avocado (I think) and a number of sauces. 

I love the little stands that the crepes come in, and the paper packing that it comes in - you can tear it as you eat. 

The owner is always friendly and welcoming. 

The store is located on ground level on its own (you don't have to go into the mall). Parking is limited and there are a number of signs that say 15 minutes only (or maybe 30?). But if anything, there is underground parking as well. The store is fairly small, there's only about 4 tables that are bar height. So it's more for a quick bite, and not so much a dine in with a group of people place."}
{"text":"I live right down the street from World on Yonge and last night was the very first time I even went in that plaza. I regret not going in there sooner because my first experience at Muncheez was amazing. The staff was very friendly and inviting, and also very good at telling me about their establishment and the menu. The sugar cane juice was incredible, no lie probably the best glass of cane juice I have ever had, they told me get the sugar can shipped in fresh every week. I chose to have the Big Boy savory crepe which had fresh veggies roast beef and turkey, tasted delicious. Great choice for a healthy alternative. The tear off box/wrapper they serve the crepes in is genius! I will be going back again many times! The can juice alone is enough to keep me coming back."}
{"text":"So I just tried Muncheez for the first time threw Uber Eats and I was very pleased everything was hot and seasoned right. I would definitely trying them again. I had the polish boy and it was very good the right amount of sauce and the catfish dinner was very good. The only complaint is that with dinners the sides could be larger. Other than that I was pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"OK so this is a designer crepe restaurant! 

I suspect they are more famous for their crepe embraced meals than the desserts.  But we went there for dessert. 

First off the staff were really great!  They explained how it works and were super nice.  It wasn't even annoying when they tried to upsell ;)

We ordered a banana Nutella crepe.   So you can't really go wrong with Nutella,  and the crepe was pretty tasty.... but their crepe was not as soft as other desserts.  Maybe it has to be this way in order to accommodate the eating style which is more sandwich than knife and fork.  But I prefer the soft melt in your mouth kind.

I probably need to go back and try something filling.  It was an interesting idea... 

The place is very small so probably better for takeout unless it's empty.  All in all I would likely go back and recommend it.. but there may be better options out there if you just want a soft dessert crepe! :p"}
{"text":"Happened to be in Toronto area and found this place. They offer savory and sweet crepes. On the savory menu they have breakfast and lunch. I tried one of the breakfast items and it was fantastic. The folks who work there seem are very friendly. In my short stay my family and I have been there twice and plan to go there once more before we leave town. In summary, I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Extremely satisfied both time's that I've been here. Staff was all extremely nice and welcoming, walking me and my friends through the process the first time we came. The food was very good, and didn't take very long at all to cook. This all being said, the first time I came they had completely run out of their signature Sugar Cane Juice, which when I tried the next time I came seemed fairly overpriced, and they had forgotten an ingredient I asked and paid extra for. 
All in all, I would come back another time, considering the quality of the crepes, and the aura you get from the friendly staff and nice decor."}
{"text":"YOU GOTTA EAT HERE! 
I was looking for a savory crepe place in the Yonge and Steeles area and i found it!

The environment and the owners are so welcoming. Modern decor and latin music is the first thing you experience.

I got a savoury crepe that was just out of this world. I am not a huge fan of deli meats and this just changed my mind completely. I ordered a Nutella and straberries crepe for my friend and it was absolutely a delight as well! 

The cherry on the top was the Sugar Cane juice. I've never had that before and i can honestly say that it was really refreshing and tasty!"}
{"text":"If this were a trial I'd be guilty.  As sin.  Bring the noose.  I ate here and failed to review it for 2-3 months.  And food this good needs to be reviewed quickly.  Send for the hangman I say!

Ok, so it's dope.  Period.  I never thought a crepe sandwich could be as good as it is here but it is here, ok?

Very fresh ingredients in an expertly made crepe that is then crisped on the outside to give it an unparalleled texture.... all with a set of truly delicious (I believe homemade) sauces..... this is great food.  Each sandwich is so different but they're all so damned good!  I was impressed.  We tried 4 different types between the two of us.  I know one was BLT, one was smoked meat, one was chicken and I forgot the other.  All were amazing but the BLT and chicken stood out.

Um..... eat there.  Then...... drink there.  Cane juice is a poppin' and the isht is fresh and tasty af.  Excuse my French.  But it's that good that I turn French whenever I think of it (I'm not talking' kissing 'neither).  I've drunk a good many tasty cane juices in my life and these guys do it right.  Some of the best I've had in Canada.  

Ok, so eat there.  

Finally - staff are class acts.  Really make you feel welcomed and taken care of.  One of them can balance a crepe on his big toe as well but I'm not going to tell you which one so you'll have to ask all of them!

Enjoy - you won't have much choice in the matter!"}
{"text":"How does a place get rated 5 stars with over 200 reviews? Let me just start off by saying this place is wicked! Has a range of different crepes you can choose from- from savoury to sweet. Made my own with pastrami and chicken breast and it was incredibly yummy! The sugar cane green juice was also really good. Tip: getting pastrami is a good idea! 

My only suggestion to this place is to expand; there's not many seats in this tiny restaurant. Service is also a little bit slow, but reasonable given that they make the crepe on the spot. If you have some time to wait, and you're in the area, I highly recommend this restaurant.

Oh and there's a poke stop near by (in case any one was wondering :p)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Was reffered by a family member who lives in the plaza, extremely friendly staff, feels like family when you walk in, amazing food and the fresh drinks are awesome!"}
{"text":"Decided to visit this place due to 5 star rating, expecting to find good Paris style crepes. While this turned out not to be the case, as these ones are not mainstream French crepes, yet they are definitely unique and delicious. I really enjoyed Big Boy and  Berry World, my wife liked Philly cheesesteak and Big Red.
Concept of serving them in the special holder and special peel-off  paper wrap is very interesting and original, and while it may become a little messy in the end, the service was impeccable, and the owners are very friendly.
So after all, I think 5 stars are well deserved, will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and it was great. I had the big bird crepe with sugar cane with ginger and mint juice. I would come back again!"}
{"text":"We ordered El Paradiso, New York's Own and Philly Cheese Steak.  Nothing smashing really but I like the concept that it is crepe-based. 
Among the three the NYO is the best. 
I also tried the watermelon drink. Not made fresh. It's already in their big jug. You can do this way better at home...and for less the price."}
{"text":"There's no way I'm going to be the one to crack their sterling 5 star reputation. Heck no. And why should I, this place meets the hype - believe that! 

I was dubious on arrival, hungry and miffed at the parking situation (and that it was hidden just north of Yonge and Steeles) but that's not news and not their fault, the mall this little hidden gem is located in isn't exactly the best layout. 

Aside from issues with geography the experience was flawless. It's a small shop (8-10 seats max) so during high time be prepared for a potential wait or to take out your food with you. 

Got to chatting with the owners and honestly they're the nicest people around. They care about building their business one customer at a time with quality healthy ingredients and great customer service - and it shows. 

Despite the tempting sweet crepe offerings I wanted something savoury. So glad I went with the Big Boy crepe which was jam packed with fresh ingredients and topped with a little BBQ sauce. Amazing. My fave part had to be watching them make my crepe to order and then piling the ingredients on top and inside before folding it up and serving it hot to me. 

In addition to the crepe I was going to have just a water but Raman, one of the owners convinced me to give their freshly squeezed sugar cane juice a try. He explained the lengthy list of health benefits in it and how they source it straight from Costa Rica. You can have it straight on the rocks or dress it up a little. I went with fresh lemon juice and mint so that it tasted almost like a mojito (sans booze). Amazing. 

Pretty pumped on this place and without the help of my Yelp community I don't think I ever would have found this place.

{"text":"The menu has updated recently, and crepes are now custom made and cheaper. You can choose up to 4 toppings. Service was very good and food comes in approximately 8 minutes after ordering. There might be a small wait time to find a seat. Restaurant is small but organized and clean."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried  savory crepes- little bird and philly cheese steak. They were delicious and fresh! We also had  sugar cane juice with lemon and watermelon juice. They both were good! The sugar cane juice with lemon was so refreshing! It's definitely worth a try! 

The owner was very friendly and informative. He even gave us two small samples of sugar cane juice without lemon.

We will be coming back for some dessert crepes!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, we walked near closing time but the staff was very helpful & knowledgeable. 
In sweets recommend: el paradise
In savory: steak"}
{"text":"Nothing will let you down here! All fresh! Details determine success! I have tried smoked nemo, so good. Sugar cane comes from Costa Rican. The juice is not too sweet. Try it original or with add on options."}
{"text":"Came here for a late snack on a Wednesday and it's was fairly busy. 

Pros:
- Well priced 
- Good taste 
- Professional service

Cons:
- Prices on website are outdated (they're about 40% more expensive)"}
{"text":"3.5
To be honest, I thought the food and drinks were good but not five star. 
Owner is nice and attentive. 
Expect to be hungry. It's not something that will fill you up. 

Parking sucks in the plaza. 
I hear they are opening a downtown location which will sure be successful."}
{"text":"This place is the holy grail, the promised land, utopia of munching. Absolutely delicious crêpe wraps with a spectrum of ingredient choices to toss inside it."}
{"text":"Great crepes! I would definitely revisit. Their pricing is a bit funny though. They have one crepe option for 5.99, and because I wanted to change one ingredient, it was then considered a custom crepe, and it ended up costing over $7. Nonetheless, it's still a great place. I tried their dessert crepe, but I definitely wanna try their savoury one next time!"}
{"text":"-- My First Impression --

I had a craving for crepes and was looking for creperies on yelp. Then I discovered Muncheez had a 5-star on yelp and my first thought was that there's no way a new restaurant could score a 5-star. I decided to give it a try. Muncheez was located in Shops on Yonge (closest intersection is Yonge and Steeles). When we walked in, we were greeted by the shop owners in a very warm and sincere manner. I found the store quite cozy and there was a lot of grafitti art on the wall, which made the store look cool and modern. Since this was our first time here, we asked the owner to give us some suggestions on what to order. He explained the menu thoroughly and I never had such great service from a dessert place before. 

-- Food and Drink -- 

We ordered 3 items:

1. PhillyCheese Steak Savory Crepe (Crepe with Roast beef, green peppers, spanish onions, mushrooms, arugula, cheddar cheese, BBQ Sauce)

- Their ingredients were very fresh and they provided a very generous amount of ingredients. I liked how they organized the ingredients in a very neat and tidy way. I really enjoyed looking at how the guy in the crepe station prepared the crepes. Unlike other creperies in which they pan fried the crepe and served it right away, Muncheez took their time to let the cooked crepe cool down before adding other additional ingredients onto it. 

The crepe itself was very thin, chewy and crunchy, the flavors all mixed well together. The spice gave an extra kick on flavor. I really enjoyed the freshness of the veggies. The cheese melted on the roast beef and combined well together with the barbeque sauce. My husband is a typical meat lover and he hates veggies. However, he finished the entire crepe + the veggies. 

2. El Paradiso Sweet Crepe (Crepe with Avocado, marshmallow and nutella)

- I never tried any avocado dessert in my entire life and was worried that veggies would not go well with sweets. I loved how the texture of the avocado softened and blended well with the melted marshmallows. The nutella and the mixture were oozing out of the crepe and it tasted like heaven. 

3. Sugar Cane juice

- I found the sugar cane juice quite sweet. I wouldn't suggest it to be paired with the sweet crepe. However, I love how the juice complemented the taste of the steak crepe. It made the crepe less spicy and made me feel soothing and healthy.

-- Overall --

I enjoyed my experience at Muncheez and would definitely go back to Mencheez in the near future! Helpful staff + fresh ingredients + delicious crepe :)
I hope they will open a franchise in the near future! :)"}
{"text":"We were visiting friends in Markham and they suggested we go for lunch to this deli creperie. What a amazing culinary treat. It is very small and usually busy but their food is amazing. Open from 11 am - 11pm. The freshest ingredients and the crepes are made as ordered, Their sugar cane drink is a speciality, although it did not appeal to me. I can see these franchising throughout Ontario. Brilliant idea."}
{"text":"Overall - 4.0/5.0

Had this place on my hit list for a while and was super curious as to how this place is getting a 5* rating from 250~ reviews. 

First of all, you are immediately greeted by their super friendly staff right when you walk in. As well, they walk through their entire menu at a high level for those who have not been there before. This experience alone already gives you a very good first impression and draw them into their store by making you feel right at home.

In terms of the crepes, I tried the \"Mama Mia\" which consists of Hungarian salami, spinach, avocado, mushrooms, red onions, havarti cheese, and chipotle sauce. Crepe was thin and slightly chewy as you bite into it. A little bit on the greasier side which maybe due to the fat from the salami and cheese but quite tasty.

It was slightly messy to eat given that it was served in a cone. I do prefer to eat it the traditional way on a plate and it would be great if they could offer such an option as well.

I would definitely come back to try their dessert crepes in the near future."}
{"text":"Savory crepes are delicious. I had the Philly Cheesesteak and really liked the combo of ingredients including the sauce. At $8.5, I think the price was okay (given that crepes are usually a little expensive for some reason). Also tried my wife's Big Bird crepe, which was good too

Service is very friendly

Tried some sweet crepe as well... it was good, but I definitely thought it was more \"standard\". As opposed to the savory one, which was significantly better than at other places IMO. 

My main complaint is that the wait time per crepe is pretty long. There were a lot of people ordering while I was there (weekend lunchtime), so it did take a while to come out. Not recommended if you're in a rush

The sugar cane drink sounded good based on the description, I have a hard time paying $6 for a drink that is not alcoholic/ caffeinated, especially since I already have a Vitamix at home. 

This place is probably better to get takeout. There are 4 tables (2 2-people & 2 4-people). 

I'll be back for the savory crepes. I may my order ahead to minimize wait time. 
I recommend this place for  lunch (not dinner) as the crepe is  not super filling, at least for a guy."}
{"text":"Came here twice, the yelp reviews for this place are crazy! The first time I was not impressed and didn't really get why it was so popular so I think it might have been what I ordered. The first time I came I only got cinnamon, honey and butter and my crepe tasted very flat. This time I got the cane juice ($5.99) with avocado ($0.99), this was really really smooth and tasty but a bit pricey I thought (compared to downsview flea market where you can get a jug to take home for $10). This time I made my own crepe and got nutella, bananas and shredded coconut and OMG this was amazing, the thing is the crepes are so fresh and hot that everything melts in your mouth. I really like they packaging which makes your crepe so easy and clean to eat, the owner is super nice and offers wet wipes at the end of your meal.

*If its your first time here: Make your own crepe, nutella and bananas are a must, add whatever else you like, still try the cane juice with avocado although its expensive"}
{"text":"As soon as you walk in, you are invited into friendly and welcoming atmosphere, hosted by Rameen and Reza, the owners of the shop. Not only is their food of the highest quality, but their service is second to none. 
They take the time to introduce you to their well orchestrated menu, and they don't cut any corners when preparing your food. 
This is by far one of the best eateries in Toronto, and it's a must for anyone who is looking to enjoy a well prepared, HEALTHY, and high quality savory crepe. 

My personal favorite is the Big boy, which goes well with their Sugar cane/watermelon juice!

These guys are amazing, and I encourage everyone to try them out."}
{"text":"Delicious crepes! Fresh ingredients, beautiful presentation, and friendly staff! It was my first time having a crepe for lunch and I absolutely loved it! Definitely recommend, Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The go-to place in Toronto for savoury crepes. The crepes are freshly made with all types of ingredients. They have a number of different crepes on the menu from various global cuisines, which taste very authentic. I tried the shakshuka (Moroccan) - which was great. The owner is usually there and is a great guy. There is plenty of underground parking and washroom at the Shops @ Yonge plaza. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"These guys have everything that I would expect from a 5-star rating. Fun, flavorful, fancy menu items at a very reasonable price and a LOT of healthy options. The service is quick, and the customer service is top notch. There is also plenty of parking available, and also there is decent seating area inside and outside. I cant imagine why anyone would go for a typical \"fast food\" alternative."}
{"text":"Thornhill is finally starting to get some trendy eats! this was a fantastic Instagram find, the most delicious out of this world crepes! 
the menu is designed with heart and soul, it is also designed with hopes that will not pick it apart, so be respectful and choose one of their delicious crepes of the season instead of making your own - you won't be disappointed. 
The best thing though was the sugar cane juice! how insanely delicious - I can not stop reading all the online articles featuring the miraculous benefits natural sugar cane juice does for the body! Seriously - do not pass this tall glass on the rocks up.
Beyond impressed."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Great if you're in the area and looking for fresh and fast good. A little pricey"}
{"text":"I found this hidden gem on Yelp and finally got to try it! Best quality time with siblings over a great brunch! The location itself is quite hidden inside a small condo plaza however totally worth it! Seating wise, there aren't much space but staff and service was beyond my expectations! I believe the owner himself makes the crepes fresh right in front of you. There is a wide selection of savoury and sweet crepes and you can also make your own (kind of like subway but even better because it is stuffed in a fresh crepe). If you are hungry and can eat a lot, this location can definitely fill you up! The price is reasonable with a calming and clean atmosphere. 

I definitely recommend to try their fresh sugarcane drinks! I mixed mine with fresh fruits and it became one of the greatest smoothie I've ever tried! I will definitely bring more people here for breakfast, lunch or brunch! :)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for brunch. The crepes are unique and pretty delicious. I got the signature Blue Jay and it was great. It was perfect for me because I wanted something not too heavy with plenty of flavour. It's a savoury-sweet crepe, unique to me because it had cream cheese,  maple syrup, and chopped walnuts (made for a nice texture) along with the meat (I think it was turkey) and greens. It was honestly delicious and I would get it again. My boyfriend got the Dr. Seuss and he loved it. It was a savoury crepe, VERY filling. We were also recommended to try a sugar cane drink. We were hesitant because of the pricing but i thought it couldn't hurt to try since we've come a long way to visit. We got the First Kiss, which is freshly juiced sugarcane with strawberries and avocado. This drink was literally fresh haha! We were surprised when she took out real sugar cane bamboo and started juicing it in front of us. The drink was DELICIOUS! And what's so great was the lady who made it really filled our cup past the lid, almost to the top ANDDDD when we were a few minutes into drinking it, she offered to pour us the rest of the drink that was leftover from the blender! Which was so awesome of her bc I felt like I was really getting all my money's worth of the drink. It was a really great thirst quencher, I almost went back for a second one after we've already left the place!
Besides the food and drink, the ambience was great. It felt modern and welcoming. What I especially thought was unique was the wired fence decoration on their wall where people can attach a lock with their names onto it. Me and my boyfriend are definitely going to come back with our names written on a lock to attach haha. All  staff there were so nice and welcoming, we definitely plan to go back with some friends to try other crepes and drinks from the menu. Honestly best creperie ever."}
{"text":"So I've wanted to try this place for a while now...mainly because it's so close to me but also because of the 200+ reviews giving it an impressive rating. It's located north of steeles on yonge, in a set of apartment/condo buildings. We came one weekday evening and there was ample parking (heads up: outdoor parking is limited, it's small, and it's also one way!)

The choice of crepes seemed endless, especially with the ability to customize your own. But was it worth the cost..hmmm..that I'm not sure about. I'm not craving to come back (but maybe that was my over hyping it up in my own head). It was delicious, but since I've had other dessert crepes before, it didn't taste any more tasty than the others. We ordered the mother nature and Berry dessert crepes. Came up to close to $20 for both. We ordered ours to go since the restaurant itself was a bit crowded."}
{"text":"There are many great reviews for Muncheez already, which is why I wanted to come by and try it out. I was already expecting it to be good, but was definitely blown away! 

Parking is a bit funny here, as the spots in front are limited, but I came later in the evening on a weeknight, so it all worked out. The store itself is quite small, with seating room for about 12 people at most. It was very brightly decorated and a very welcoming environment. 

The owner was super friendly and nice, explaining how everything worked and a couple recommendations. I ended going for the Mama Mia and an Original Sugar Cane Juice, and my friend got the Lil Bird.
First off the Sugar Cane Juice was amazing. I've never had sugar cane from Costa Rica, but it was delicious, light, and sweet without being over the top. There are options to add other elements to it, and they gave us free samples of sugar cane juice with banana, but I gotta say it was great just the way it was.
My Mama Mia literally blew my mind. It was flavourful, but in perfect balance.  Every ingredient put it was well thought out and everything complimented each other. The basil pesto definitely pulled it all together. 
The Lil Bird was quite good as well, and my friend added in banana peppers by recommendation, and it was definitely a winner. Lighter in flavour compared to the Mama Mia, but also done perfectly. 
The crepes were well made as well, done in the same fashion as the Parisian crepes!

What really surprised me was their attentiveness and service. I was expecting it to be more fast food, where you order, grab, and go, but they brought us our food and drinks, offered wet-naps, and came over to ask if everything was good. We even got free samples! It may be that we came on a quieter night, but thats what got them their 5 stars for me!

With a large variety on their menu, I will definitely be back to try different crepes next time, both savoury and sweet! I highly recommend you come check this place out!"}
{"text":"Great place for crepes. It's actually tucked away in the plaza so it's a bit hard to find. The actual place is kind of small with a few tables so definitely not a place for large groups. Everyone that worked there was super friendly and took the time to explain the menu.

We got the smoked nemo which was delicious and had a bit of a spicy kick. I also made my own with ham, cheese, mushrooms, and spinach. It was very good. The only thing I wish they had is a buckwheat crepe for their savoury crepes. We also had a sugar cane juice with mint. Very refreshing but pricey. All in all a very good experience and if I'll be back again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I was craving some really good crepes and my husband drove us to Muncheez.   Got a dessert crepes if Nutella, walnuts and bananas.   

Unlike our first couple of experiences months back, the crepes didn't taste nearly as good.   The crepe texture was kind of soggy.   The toppings were fine but combined with the crepe, it was underwhelming.  

At our previous visits, we had the owners make the crepes which were superb.   However, with the new staff, the quality of the crepes were not the same.    And for this reason along with the drive to go there, we will be on the hunt again for alternative creperies! 

3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Recommend this place for sure!! 
Amazing , yummy, healthy, and fresh, One of my favourite . Variety is great and good service."}
{"text":"The first time I came here I ordered a dessert crepe and it was pretty good! I always thought crepes should be sweet and not savoury so I never gave the savoury crepes a shot...UNTIL now! 

Tried the Little Bird and it was so good!! Everything is made right in front of you too! I want to literally try every single item on the menu. 

The service is great! They are very nice and accommodating. Definitely would recommend this place"}
{"text":"Best crepes I've had in the GTA!

We got savoury ones during our visit and I'm so sad I didn't take a picture of it to show you how stuffed it was with ingredients. Very filling and very satisfying. Will visit again and hopefully try one of their dessert crepes and their all day breakfast crepes. Also the staff is extremely friendly!"}
{"text":"Yup. The 5 star ratings are for a good reason. Food is great and place is funky. Very friendly and top notch service."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. 
Their savory crepes are especially good but the sweet ones also don't disappoint. I tried the sugar cane drink today and although it was a bit pricy (no more than a typical Starbucks drink though) it was very tasty. It's so good my kid brother even loved it ! And he's a picky little sh*t. It's an added bonus that it has so many health benefits.
Staff is also very friendly and I love the way they've painted and filled the the walls in here. It's gorgeous."}
{"text":"So glad I checked this place out because it made the best crepes I ever had!

I got the Big Bird crepe and the crepe itself was crispy at the top and still had places where it was soft. The ingredients they used seemed fresh and they make it right in front of you. The staff are extremely friendly and are very willing to help you with your order. The sugar cane juice with mint was refreshing and delicious. Only wish there was more because I finished my drink so quickly!

Loved the concept of fresh, healthy, well-made crepes for a reasonable price. Well done Muncheez!"}
{"text":"The crepes live up to the reviews. It was so good! I ordered the Lil Bird with a jalapeño kick and wow. I would definitely go again and try out their other savory crepes. I love the way they are packaged for easy eating. The flavours and ingredients are fresh and they with really well together! 

I read the reviews and tried the freshly squeezed sugar cane juice with mint. The juice was fresh and light and the mint added an interesting (but good) dimension to the drink. I did feel like I got leaf bits in my teeth so that was a minor inconvenience. 

The service was great and the staff was so friendly and knowledgeable. It was my first time there and it definitely won't be my last. The place did get pretty packed around lunch time so if your looking for a spot to sit then you might be out of luck. 

The place was quaint and tidy but difficult to find since it was hidden behind condos. I'm glad I found it and I can't wait to try more!"}
{"text":"Fresh, good food, excellent service. I ordered the \"hot stuff\" which comes with hot salami, spinach, tomatoes, black olives, mushrooms, basil, Havarti cheese, tomato sauce. I don't like black olives. So they asked if I wanted to substitute something else instead and in fact recommended jalapenos. The crepe was a tiny bit chewy like a crepe should be. It was stuffed full with ingredients."}
{"text":"Best service ever .
Clean, cozy, great little place.
Crepes were very savory, freshly made and combinations were great!
Definitely visiting again highly recommended."}
{"text":"I've been here twice for dessert crepes. After the first visit last year I was very disappointed. After reading so many rave reviews I had high expectations. However the crepe was not made fresh and was taken from a pile of pre made crepes, as a result the taste was compromised. Tonight I decided to give it another try. I thought that possibly they would make the crepe fresh when it isn't too busy however it was the same thing tonight, a pre made crepe from a pile. Although this means practically no waiting time the taste is just not the same and not worth more than 2 stars."}
{"text":"Yummmm! This place has the best savory crepe I've had. The issue that I usually have with savory crepes is that most of the time, there's very little stuff inside the crepe, and it feels like I'm just eating the crepe and no fillings. However, the crepes at Muncheez are stuffed with goodies, and every single bite is awesome! I got the Lil Bird crepe, which was delicious! The garlic aoli was on point! Also, the crepes are made fresh right in front of you.

Muncheez is located in the shops of a condo complex on Yonge just north of Steeles. There's 30 minute parking right outside the restaurant, or there's underground parking as well. The restaurant is quite small, with only seating for around 10 people. However, when I was there on a Saturday night, the restaurant was never fully packed, as a lot of people come in and get take out.

I can't wait to come back and try the other crepes!"}
{"text":"I had a sweet crepe from Muncheez,  strawberries and Nutella.  I really liked the flavor of the crepe and the atmosphere of the restaurant as well. It is pretty small and gets pretty hot inside so make sure you like the heat :).  I like the presentation of the crepes and I like how they have so many combinations and ingredients to choose from.   Check out this spot! You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"If you clicked into this thinking, \"Hot dayuuuum. Look at that 5/5 star rating from 130 reviews! Does this place actually live up to its hype?!\" 
Well, my dear Yelper, I had the same question before and now that I've been, I can tell you that it is indeed a 5 star creperie. 

Let's talk about the food first. 
They offer a selection of crepes, both savoury and sweet. I ordered a customized savoury crepe and was allowed to choose 1 meat, 1 cheese, and 4 veggies. Talk about not being cheap on the ingredients! The crepe is stuffed with a generous amount of toppings and cooked to a perfect light crunch. It's neither too dry nor too oily and overall was a delectable snack. For $8.50, it's definitely not the cheapest meal around. It will satisfy your immediate hunger, but may likely leave you craving for more. 
We also tried the highly acclaimed sugar cane juice ($6) and unfortunately, it wasn't anything special. Surely, it tasted fine and it's nice that we got to witness it being freshly squeezed from the sugar canes, but flavour-wise, it's only mediocre. Decent drink, expensive price, not worth it. 

Next, I want to praise the impeccable service. We were greeted by a super friendly owner who asked if it was our first time there, and then followed to give us a brief overview of the menu. As this is a \"you go up to the cashier to order\" kinda place, we went to find seats after ordering and waited for our number to be called. Surprisingly, the employee brought our food to our table instead! He then explained to us how to rip the paper holder as we ate the crepe and he also came back to bring us wet towels as we were finishing up :) You don't get that kind of service everyday! 

Great place. Friendly staff. Yummy crepes. Will definitely come back to try the sweet crepes another time since it's so close to Finch Station."}
{"text":"Great savory crepes! 
Philly cheese steak was amazing. The food is really good and the staff are fantastic. 

They will talk to you and ask you what you like then they recommend the best crepe that suits your taste buds. 

They also have yummy sugar cane juice!"}
{"text":"I've been to Muncheez several times and it's been really good every single time! I usually get the savoury crepes - my favourite one is the Nemo (avocado + smoked salmon, how can you resist?!)
I have also tried their freshly squeeze cane juice, it's so refreshing in the summer.

Since my boyfriend and I already had lunch, we decided to share a crepe. He has a sweet-tooth, so he was all in for the sweet crepe. And since we had lunch already, I was about to give in and get a sweet crepe. BUT then I saw \"Ali G\" under the breakfast crepe category. It consists of nutella (his favourite), peanut butter (my fav), bacon (we both like it) and an egg. You guys might be thinking...peanut butter, nutella AND bacon??! I know, I know, I was a bit skeptical of how the flavours will go together as well, but after the first bite, I was SOLD. 

The crepe came piping hot! The crispy bacon wasn't oily at all and it blended really well with the peanut butter-nutella mixture. I liked how they strategically placed the bacon so they were evenly distributed, allowing you to have bacon in almost every bite! Near the bottom of the crepe, it was so nutella rich that it was spilling out as you bit into it. That was wayyy too sweet for me, but my bf loved it. 

Despite the miserable day....a ice storm in April, the staff were cheery and welcoming! So my bf and I left very satistified and ready to face the winter again."}
{"text":"I've come here twice now - the first time I came after dinner for dessert, and got the \"Berry World\" crepe and the watermelon juice. I saw all of their fresh ingredients and had a craving for the savoury crepe ever since. So of course, being satisfied with the sweet crepe I tried, I went back a couple weeks later for the \"Hot Stuff\" and the sugar cane juice. They are flexible with letting you change some of the ingredients - I replaced the mushrooms with jalapenos (but couldn't get avocados - those are 'premium vegetables'). 

Service was excellent! The first time I went, they asked if I had ever been there before, then took the time to explain how everything works. They have a neat crepe holder design that lets you eat your crepe with minimal mess. If you eat there, they also give you wet wipes after you're done. Surprisingly, they recognized us the second time we went, which was over two weeks after our first visit. 

The drinks were freshly squeezed and tasted pretty good, but overpriced in my opinion. After I added mint and lemon to my sugar cane juice, the drink ended up being $7! I probably won't be getting the drinks again next time.

Overall, I'll definitely be back for any crepe cravings."}
{"text":"Everytime I walk in, the owner is so humble and genuinely nice. They are young, professional and very friendly. Honestly, they are fast, delicious and super healthy. Great vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Absolutely delightful experience and excellent food. Had their 'muscle flex'. Sugar cane juice with mint and lemon juice is a must-try specialty"}
{"text":"All around great spot. Nice staff, deep menu, fresh items. 

Their passion for crepes really comes across. They even have some interesting toppings like crickets! 

Highly recommended if you are in the mood for crepes. It's located in an interesting brand new mall that's worth a look too."}
{"text":"The service was great, honestly though. I made my own crepe with salmon, cream cheese and mushrooms and I was over whelmed by the amount of mushrooms I had gotten.. I couldn't really taste the other ingredients which was kind of disappointing honestly, but my boyfriend crepe was amazing (of course I tried it), guess I just got to try one of their recommended ones or get a sweet"}
{"text":"Place is nicely decorated, service is great. The people are friendly and make great recommendations. U tried the sweet crepes - Johnny's Obsession with bacon, walnut and nutella was so yummy. I just wish they had ice cream too!

Next time I would definitely try their signature savoury crepes."}
{"text":"I love their crepes here! I always crave their sweet crepes with oreos in it.....
They use fresh ingredients and don't skimp on anything on your crepes. Everything is customizable and that's one of the reasons why I always think about this place, kind of like DIY without putting in the effort (for those lazy cooks!) The service here is always great. They're always friendly and willing to explain anything that you're unsure of. The place is small, having enough space for at least 10 people to sit in to eat. 

They have amazing savoury and sweet crepes. The savoury crepes is big enough to fill you up contently but not make you become bloated. Which means you will always have room to try their sweet crepes! (If this is a marketing strategy, it works out very well). For the sweet crepe I always put nutella in it and sometimes it is nutella overload and may get too sweet for me to finish. That's why sharing one is probably the best choice. If you decide to eat a second crepe for the day, it is best to share the sweet crepe with someone as it can also become too filling. 

Never forget the oreos!!"}
{"text":"Good crepes but I am confused by all the rave around the sugar cane juice. They make it the same way Chinatown street stalls do it: by putting the raw cane through the machine. So there's no real difference except this costs $6 and you can get toppings (at extra cost).

The crepes are correspondingly expensive as well, but decent quality. If they priced everything $1-2 lower I would come much more frequently. And I wouldn't get the sugar cane juice again...it's refreshing but Chinatown has the same thing and I am downtown often anyways. I guess they have a monopoly in this area on sugar cane juice and if you don't want to go all the way to Chinatown then you can get one here."}
{"text":"In the middle of devouring the most incredible crepe concoction ever, my fiance asks, \"why aren't there more places like this.\" To which i responded, \"because incredible people like Ramen are few and far.\"
Seriously, his passion and excitement is contagious. He's not doing something different just to stand out, he lives by it!"}
{"text":"The Big Bird savory crepe had oven roasted turkey breast, lettuce, kosher pickles, green peppers, avocado, havarti cheese, and mustard.  This was all wrapped up so nicely in a thin layered crepe.

I was pleasantly surprised at how such a crepe with simple ingredients could taste so good!  It was really fresh.  I remember the lettuce was crispy and crunchy.

It was a light savory crepe for a small lunch.  It was really good and if something so simple tasted so good, I can only imagine that the other heftier crepes will be delicious too!

I heard that they also have crepes with crickets on them.  I will have to return in the future someday to try them out."}
{"text":"First time here and we loved it! The place is small but spotless and lovely decor. Has a definite Queen St West vibe to it :)  We went with our boys (7, 11) and had savoury crepes: 3 of us made our own and my husband had Santa's omelet. All of them were delicious: mine was spinach, egg, mushroom, tomatoes and they recommended the dried tomato pesto with it (perfect). We drank watermelon juice and had a chance to taste the fresh pressed sugar cane juice which was amazing. I definitely recommend this place, it's a wonderful experience. A note re. Seating - they have about 5 high seat tables which seat up to 3 people each - we pulled two together for a party of 4. 

Next time we'll tide our bikes here and get takeout for a lovely picnic in the park. 

Oh and... The people who work there are lovely."}
{"text":"A hidden jewel.  So glad to have this great creperie in the north end of the city.  

They specialize in savoury and dessert crepes. I was told any crepe can be customized but I decided to try one of their specialty savoury combinations, the philly cheese.  The crepe was deliciously crisp and filled with roast beef, cheddar cheese, green peppers, arugula, onions and BBQ sauce.  It was wrapped in a cleverly designed sleeve where you tear it apart as you eat to expose the crepe.  Not only yummy but this crepe was huge and makes a satisfying meal. 

I washed it down with their sugar cane drink. It was freshly squeezed to order.  Not overly sweet like pop, just perfect and very refreshing. 

I will definitely come again and try one of their dessert crepes to satisfy my sweet tooth or another savoury crepe. 

Tip:  This place is not visible from the street. It's located in a outdoor courtyard surrounded by many other eateries and shops.  You can park for free in the courtyard or underground."}
{"text":"Amazing service and food! The staff is so sweet and professional too. Hard to not get addicted to crepes! Used to not like them before muncheez came around :)"}
{"text":"Has been on my hit list for some time. Popped in with my son, who had the Nemo (Smoked Salmon) while I tried the Philly Cheese Steak.  Both were put together extremely well and efficiently..they got the entire prep & customer experience down pat. Very friendly & helpful staff. Crepe's were extremely tasty and a novel experience all around. 
We'll done"}
{"text":"Was a bit skeptical of all the high reviews.  Just had brunch here and was completely blown away.  All the ingredients are so fresh.  I had the jam rock and my husband had the hot stuff.  The place has very limited seating but we didn't have any trouble getting a seat. Totally worth the drive from Scarborough. Try the sugar cane juice with lemon... It's a great cure for a hangover too."}
{"text":"Love this place. Love their vibe as soon as I walked in the store. Although the space is a little bit tight, but having great food and great customer service is all that counts. I got here after dinner on a weekday for dessert, it wasn't busy when I first got there. The later it gets, the more people show up. I ordered the Elvis, it's a dessert crepe made with three simple ingredients, almonds, banana, and nutella. It was the perfect combination. Each ingredients compliment each other very well. And of course, what can go wrong when you have Nutella? The staff are extremely friendly and helpful. They make sure you have the best experience at your visit and they welcome any comments, good and bad."}
{"text":"So delicious! Amazing value and really yummy mixes of ingredients. Friendly staff, super cool packaging for eating the crepes and a great atmosphere overall. Tried the Mother Nature one and smoked salmon, a full meal and super fresh. Will be back."}

The place is very small. This small restaurant could probably seat up to about 15 people. Like some of the yelpers describe, it's like a prestige subway, the layout, and how you can pick your own toppings and sauces. 

I've always like the salty crepes over the sweet ones so when I came across muncheez, I wanted to give this place a try. I got the mama mia. It was just the right about of saltiness and flavour. I had a late lunch and I can't believe I was able to finish a while waffle by myself! It must have meant it was really good! My tastebuds and stomach told me. 

Service was really good. They even gave us wet naps which I was impressed with! 

I'd come back again for the mama mia!"}
{"text":"As a super picky eater, I like to customize my own crepe. I prefer savoury, HUGE selection of savoury crepes. The base, I asked for smoked salmon, and for veggies, I've requested red onions, corn, and avocado (all my favourites) and garlic aioli. 

The selection went well together. But next time I will ask for my crepe to be softer as I personally prefer softer and more chewy crepes. I like the design of the paper holder for the crepes, you can peel accordingly to the steps so you don't have to get your hands dirty. They serve it with a crepe stand. 

My hubby ordered the bacon with chocolate, I took a bite of it and it was good.

They also serve a wide variety of fresh Costa Rica sugar cane juice, from sugar and mint to apple and lime. One full board full of different combinations! Very interesting variety. As a first timer, I had the original. I want to try it just straight up with no add on. 

It was good and fresh. Reminds me of being back in HK on the street where they freshly squeeze my sugar cane juice. 

Very helpful and friendly service to help us decide what to choose from a wide selection of menu.

Ambiance is nice, good lighting as I love filament lightbulbs, especially as a migraine sufferer, I am very sensitive to certain lightings. So the restaurant lighting is very important to me. 

 I will be back to try other crepes and ask for softer next time! This helps to overcome a gloomy snowy freezing rain day!"}
{"text":"HOLY CREPE BATMAN! As of this update, I'm proud to say I've tried the whole menu (including the dessert and breakfast crepes) and I've even tried the make-your-own crepe. Best crepes in the city still and that's facts. Raz, Raman and Maria are some of the nicest owners around. Their staff are also super friendly (the lady with the hairnet always stuffs my crepes nice and plump with fillings)!

My favorite breakfast crepe is a tie between Steak & Egg and Dr. Seuss. If I'm feelin saucy that day, I go with Dr. Seuss cuz the crepe is more saucy. If I want more heartiness usually I go for the Steak & Egg.

My favorite savoury crepe (maybe favorite out of all of them) is the philly cheese steak . The smokey bbq sauce in the crepe is drinkable I swear. Last time I went, the girl serving me (I forgot her name) let me swap the cheddar cheese for havarti cheese (I just wanted to try diff cheese as a comparison) The cheddar cheese goes way better in the philly cheese steak crepe.

My favorite signature crepe is Tap Out. Double meat! What's not to like? Also its got all my fave veggies in one crepe lol.

My favorite sweet crepe is a tie between the Hardcore and the Mouthful.

I'm still working my way through the sugar cane mixes (used to go to market village right beside Pacific Mall for my sugar cane fix before market village got torn down recently for a new shopping mall complex). So far I think I like Hidden Dragon the most (sugar cane with ginger, mint and lemon juice). I discovered that ginger goes really well with sugar cane. However, I wish one drink wasn't so darn expensive! I could get 1L for the same price at market village back then. But alas, I'm still gonna get it because it's such a rare find in the city nowadays and also super refreshing. 

If you like your crepe crispier you can ask them to do that. I found out by mistake that the contrast of the texture is insane with the crepe you choose. Typically, I like my dessert and breakfast crepes nice and soft. With the savoury crepes, sometimes I'll ask for the crepe shell to be a lil more cooked for that extra crispiness in each bite.

It's a small shop and the parking is a nightmare during peak times but give these guys your money regardless, because they take really good care of their customers. 

One thing I am disappointed in is myself for always forgetting to ask for a loyalty card. I could've had multiple free crepes by now!"}
{"text":"A hidden treasure well worth the trip. We had 2 savory crepes paired with freshly blended watermelon juice. Excellent service, excellent ingredients and excellent food! This place is a must if you are looking for fresh, creative, friendly and extraordinary."}
{"text":"This was our first time here. We just stumbled upon it. The staff were super friendly and made the visit extremely pleasant. The crepe was delicious. I got the smoked nemo and it was perfect! We also got the sugar cane with mint and it was delicious! Sweet but different. The crepes are in a paper cone so you just unwrap it as you eat. I think it's cute how they're on little stands. The atmosphere is nice and cosy. The have small wooden tables but I suppose you don't need much space with the crepes in a stand."}
{"text":"Amazing crêpes.., generous one.. fresh cane juice is just amazing! Reasonable prices, clean, tidy and cool stuff .. it's quite hard to find a real crêpes in North York...5 out of 5..."}
{"text":"Simple and delecious ... very friendly staff ... \"thank you so much\" 

Try it once and you will get hooked 

;)"}
{"text":"My bf and I went there for brunch. He ordered hot stuff with a coffee  and I got the  mama Mia with the watermelon juice. There are a couple of small high tables by the wall and it wasn't too busy but I can see seating being a problem when it gets busy. Our food was delicious and would recommend to everyone that loves deli meats. Definitely would come back"}
{"text":"one of my favorite casual places to eat in Toronto. Especially easy when you order delivery! The food quality and taste are great :) I almost always order the big-bird but they're so many awesome choices to choose from depending on what you're feeling!"}
{"text":"I've been there a few times and always had a great experience, but this last time was special. You have got to try the \"Donald Trump\", a meat-lover crepe with crickets. Ok, once you get the \"eeeeeeewh\" out of the way, just listen. It's a fun crepe. The choices of meats, plus the balance between the mustard and the barbecue sauce and the different cheeses becomes a conduit for the tablespoon or so of crickets and the taste is very intriguing.

Every bite is a little different. You'll have a bit more cricket in one, a little less in the other. The cricket and the sweetness of the crepe will pair well. Then you'll realize the meat enhance the overall flavor, the cheeses add richness, and the mustard delivers a nice punch. It's such a complex and fascinating combination of flavors that for the first time in a long time, I was still thinking about this dish long after I left the place.

If anything, just go because the crepes are really good, the owner is really friendly, and the place is fun, albeit I wish it was bigger. The sugar cane juice is a really nice treat, their menu gets updated and you'll always find something you like. But if you are a foodie at heart, do yourself a favor and try the Trump."}
{"text":"The service was extremely friendly and helpful on letting me know about their crepes. 

I ordered the hot stuff which was basically a pizza crepe, it was good, but not as good as my friend's crepe which was the mama mia, which I think is a delight. 

The sugar can juice though, it's about $6, not that cheap BUT what a treat, I wish I could drink it everyday! 

We tried the apple dessert crepe, it had fresh apples but I was really expecting an apple pie filling type of dessert, definitely not a fan and will try a nutella based one next. Closer to a 4.5 star review."}
{"text":"Husband ordered Philly cheesesteak and the wifey ordered Lil Bird. This place will NOT disappoint. Ingredients are fresh and by far the best savory crepes we've had. Also, shared the banana nutella crepe. The quality of the crepe is what separates this place from other places that serves same item. Service was excellent!!! Food quality was stellar. Side note: must try the fresh sugar cane juice with lemon and mint. So refreshing!"}
{"text":"Yum! The husband and I saw the good Yelp reviews and came here after playing at the nearby VR game room. We ordered the simplest sweet crepe on the menu, the Pomme (apple, honey, peanut butter) and the original sugar cane juice. The crepes are presented fresh, wrapped, and upright on a metal stand - hot and easy to eat, which gets points in my books. The juice reminds me of Taiwanese night markets - very fresh (but definitely not as cheap - it's $6 a large cup).

The servers and crepe makers are very friendly even in the late hours, and the atmosphere is cozy, though too small for large groups and tables fit 2-4. If you're around the area, I'd definitely recommend you to check it out. Next time, I want to bring a friend to try a savoury crepe!"}
{"text":"A great place for both savory and sweet crepes! They are very delicious & cater to your taste. The Smoked Nemo amazing, especially for those who just love smoked salmon! Also tried the New York's Own... Oh this one has got a punch with the Dijon mustard. Taste amazing despite it being hot! If you prefer to make your own crepes, that is also an option. There is a list of ingredients from which you could choose from. Their Bid Red ( Strawberry & Nutella) and Good Stuff (Banana & Nutella) taste amazing as well. Lastly, their Sugar Cane Juice is so refreshing as well. A must try! 

Overall, a place to definitely visit!

The staff were also very helpful and friendly.

Tip: A small place, not good for very large groups."}
{"text":"So many choices and the crepes were delicious! My friend and I waffled them down like two hungry puppies."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place to order from Uber eats :) They are fast, efficient and reasonably priced! Highly recommend creating your own creepie.... there is so many options which you want something sweet or savoury ! 
Thank you Muncheez :)))"}
{"text":"This place has to be some sorta legend. An average perfect rating with 150+ reviews?? Is there some sort of weird crepe cult conspiracy? Well, I had to see it to believe it. And if there's really some sort of Muncheez cult following, sign me up because YES, I BELIEVE!  

Muncheez is a tiny shop in a tiny plaza. You've got all your fresh ingredients lined up behind a glass counter for you to pick and choose from, or select an already-made combination off the menu on their wall. It's kind of like a really classy Subway. However, Subway should have its \"Eat Fresh\" motto stripped and given to Muncheez because this place puts the entire franchise to shame. 

The ingredients are so simple but incredibly fresh. It really is the best example of doing something simply, but doing it well. The crepes are piping hot and made-to-order. I had the Mother Nature, which is a vegetarian crepe with avocado, olives, peppers, mushrooms, pesto, and other green goodies. Bf had the Big Boy, with BBQ sauce, roast beef, onions, cheese, and all that good stuff. Both were fantastic crepes and we agreed that we would get fat on this place if we ever lived in the area. 

I didn't think customer service could exist in a take-out shop like this, but Muncheez proved me wrong! We were asked frequently about how we were doing and had our cardboard crepe holders taken away for us. This is waiter-level service in a place with no waiters and it made quite an impression. 

Muncheez, I'll be back for you. I don't know when, I don't know how, but I will be back. We were both eyeing the Smoked Nemo (smoked salmon) crepe for next time, but I plan to eventually tackle every crepe on the menu.

(43/100) - 2016"}
{"text":"Oh This is a place that everyone should try...good food, with great service ... I will go back there to try other options :)"}
{"text":"Ahhhhh I love crepes!

Although located a little far from where I usually venture, this is a great crepe place to add to the repertoire.

(Food:)
The MOTHER NATURE was a wholly vegetarian option made up of black beans, avocado, green peppers, mushrooms, green olives (I subbed for tomatoes at no extra cost), havarti cheese and basil pesto.  The pesto is really distinct in the crepe, and lovely.  I will say however that the crepes are on the harder/crunchier side, which is different from the crepes I am normally used to and give the dish a more panini-like feel to them.  Its not bad, just different.

As a sweet crepe, I got the MOUTHFUL, which was nutella filled, and had a shock-load of fruit in it; banana, strawberry and blueberry.  The blueberries were large, ripe and sweet.  The dish was great!

As a side note: i love the way they serve their crepes.  With the crepe standing upright on a stand and peel-able tabs to allow for easy access to each bite.

(Price:)
MOTHER NATURE: $9.75 (very reasonable)

MOUTHFUL: $8.49


(Ambience:)
A really cute shop with both indoor and outdoor seating!  Nice place for businessmen to stop by for lunch!

(Service:)
The owners are so nice and friendly!


(Comparable:)
Cora's has a softer chewier crepe, but less variety.


(Overall:)
Awesome! Definitely deserves all the ratings it currently has!"}
{"text":"The crepes here are honestly so delicious from salty to sweet. The only thing that throws it off for me here is the service. It's quite slow and they don't follow simple instructions. I had asked for my crepe to have less honey and as they were putting it on they slabbed honey on it and I asked them that it was enough but they keep putting it on... The girl working ended up giving me a dirty look? Maybe I just had a poor experience here but I would have expected pretty friendly service from all the high reviews they had."}
{"text":"The crepes are nicely made, a bit crispy and soft. The sweet crepes are delicious but the deli crepes we are not a fan, maybe we just don't like deli meats, I would prefer something like grilled chicken breast as a meat option. It can get a bit messy near the end (bottom of the crepe)"}
{"text":"Perfect for a quick bite, if you're not from the area it isn't really in a \"destination\" because it's a little further from the last subway stop. 

Definitely  worth the drive to get there. And the sugar cane juice they have is phenomenal"}
{"text":"Best savory crepe I've ever had, or just food item in general. Had the Mama Mia and Philly Cheese Steak. Owner is passionate (and extremely friendly) about his business, and he should be, his product is excellent. Worth a trip to try.  Will absolutely come back."}
{"text":"Relatively new place. Wide range of filled crepes. Both sweet and savoury. Fresh ingredient and friendly staff. Open 11 to 11. Overall a place I'd cone back to more than many times!"}
{"text":"Great service.  Delicious crepe. Too many options lol but i built my own and it was yummy."}
{"text":"the food here is amaaaaazing. You get so much in one order! They have the best sweet crepes and the veggie savoury crepe is fantastic"}
{"text":"Saw many good reviews and finally got to try it. Sugar cane juice with mint and lemon tastes awesome, like a Mojito. Staff is very nice and welcoming. Definitely a MUST TRY."}
{"text":"Where do I begin.  Rarely do you find a business namely the food industry that there is perfection.  Muncheez is it!  The two owner/operators are friendly,  informative and respectful.  The restaurant is neat and clean. The crepes are innovative in their ingredients and very well constructed. The crepes are presented to you in a customized holder to accommodate the folded crepe, making it a breeze to eat.  Lastly I've had both the watermelon and sugar cane juice/drink, both are very satisfying, the sugar cane being a first for me, nice."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and it's always delicious! The dessert crepes are a little too sweet but the savoury breakfast crepes are delicious! The menu has changed a bit in the past few years but the service is always friendly! Every time I come they bring a sample of their sugar cane juice and napkins. Crepes are about $10-$15 each, but you can see them make it right in front of you with what appears to be very fresh ingredients! Limited seating and parking though."}
{"text":"Excellent crepes and the owner is awesome. He explained all of the different kinds of crepes and the sugar cane drink. Overall awesome place!"}
{"text":"I was drawn to this place by the never ending photos of mouth watering food constantly showing up on my timeline. I was fascinated with the chicken & waffles so I drove on down and grabbed the delectable entree as fast as I could.
1.) The photo of the entree displayed the waffles accompanied by wings. I was told they were going to be served with chicken tenders. I didn't mind but what I received were chicken bits. The bits would have had a delicious flavor if they had not been floating in syrup when I opened my container
2. The edges of the waffle not coated in syrup were crisp and flaky. It was honestly cooked to perfection but the flavor was lost in the overwhelming amount of syrup that had been absorbed into the nooks and crannies of the waffle.
3. In all the meal was okay, I recommend asking for your syrup on the side if you are brave enough to drop by.
4. The bullet proof glass that separates the patrons from the restaurant staff is very off putting. I know the establishment is not located in the best area of the city but that alone did not deter me from ordering food. I was taken aback by having to order through a crappy intercom system that was not fully operational.
5. The woman taking orders was a gem I would go back just to say hi to her but the miserable, unsavory kitchen staff made this experience less then stellar which is a shame. She is the reason I gave this restaurant 3 stars instead of 1!"}
{"text":"Wish there were 6 stars!  This is such a great change to subs and wraps.   The Crèpe is fresh warm soft and the flavour is intense.   An absolute must try.  Cheers to the young friendly staff as well.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"A unique and small crepe place that makes the crepes right in front of you so the crepes are piping hot for you to enjoy. My whole family ordered savory crepes and would most definitely go back to try the sweet crepes as well. The wrapping the crepes came in were interesting as well. The people working here are also very polite and welcoming and are great to first timers."}
{"text":"Ok I get why this place has amazing reviews. Went for a late night bite after bf's tennis match at a nearby club and got intrigued by the perfect Yelp rating. Very friendly owners that actually seem like they care about how you're doing, cute little restaurant (wish it could seat more people!) and the crepes, oh the crepes... Simple ingredients, freshly made crepes every time and they taste so good. Got the lil bird and the New York, both very tasty.. The sugar cane juice is also soo good, a little pricey, but that's what you get when you have to get them imported. I wish I live around the area"}
{"text":"one word AMAZING! found this on yelp and saw it has some pretty good reviews thought i would give this a try. first of all this place was hard to find since i am very bad with my direction. but manage to find it. went in and surprisingly it was quite small. not alot of seating area only a few tables but the interior looks very nice. walked in greeted and asked if it was first time. i got lil mama and my sis got phillycheese steak. the crepes were really good very savoury and all their ingredients are made  fresh. definitely would come back to try some different one."}
{"text":"Savoury and sweet crepes are extremely delicious every time! I love that you can customize your own crepes in addition their combos. The service has always been pleasant, as everyone is extremely kind and accommodating. Freshly squeezed watermelon juice is beyond refreshing and rejuvenating, can't wait to go back for more munching."}
{"text":"Nice food! Fresh ingredients. Tried the salmon crepe and loved it! Would recommend this place"}
{"text":"Wonderful place for crepes!!! I got a make your own crepe: strawberry Nutella

There are so much filling that it's sooo good. Mouth watering just watching them make it! 

Strawberry Nutella had always and will always be the go to crepe for me.  They have the right amount of Nutella and strawberries. I love how the edges of the crepe is crispy!!! 

I can't believe their takeout box is so cute! It's like the perfect to-go for crepes and pizza!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! I ordered the mama Mia crepe which comes with salami, pepper, cheese and the list goes on... The crepe itself is perfect. Crispy and the perfect thickness. People here are super nice too! I would definitely revisit."}
{"text":"I've put this review off for months now, because what difference will yet another 5 star make? I'm lazy, tired and now I am FINALLY writing my review for this gem of the north york/thornhill area. 

First, I didn't even know there was such thing as shops at yonge.. what is this, another shops at don mills? Parking was easy because there weren't a lot of people around during the middle of the day. Muncheez was easy to spot in this plaza- the plaza is so new.. and white.. it looks like something straight from a sims 3 town. Muncheez is not huge but it was pretty empty, surprisingly. There's a big colourful mural, which really adds something unique to this place. The guys working were a delight to talk to, and they tried so hard to recommend me something but at the same time, they looked like they were getting hungry themselves! They told me there's no 'favourite' or 'most popular' because all of the crepes were good. Believe it or not, this is the first time I've ever tried a savoury crepes.. honestly did not even know those existed.. oops! I'm not sheltered, I swear. 

The crepe I got was delicious.. I think it was big bird, or something like that? The crepe was perfectly crunchy on the outside and warm and indeed savoury on the inside. Delicious! My boyfriend had the philly cheese steak crepe and that was delightful as well, even though I originally don't like philly cheese. I loved it so much that I really wanted to try their sweet crepes as a dessert after my savoury one, but decided against it in fear of my pants popping open on the way back home. That only means one thing- I need to return to try the sweet ones! Their ingredients are so fresh, who can resist?"}
{"text":"This is the best crepe place. The owner is super nice. The place is small but very neat and clean. Food is just superb."}
{"text":"Muncheez specializes in both savoury and dessert crepes which is hard to find in the GTA. They are located in an area that is filled with many Asian restaurants but they have been able to stand out as one of the best restaurants in the area. With over 300 reviews and 4.5 rating, muncheez is definitely a place to try. 

The restaurant is very small with minimal seating, but many people mainly order to go since the crepes are easy to hold and eat. You are able to choose from their signature menu or create your own crepes as well. They stuff their crepes with the freshest ingredients and the portion is very big. 

The only downside is parking in that plaza because it is small and it is only a one way which can be quite frustrating. Hopefully they open up more locations soon!"}
{"text":"Love it go once and you will be hooked! Everythings great light and will not make you feel disgusting after. Great delicious healthy option wake up feeling great every time"}
{"text":"Food: the crepes are quite delicious - soft & crunchy. They are served in a unique manner as a rolled, upright triangle. Possibly not authentic French but unique. They only have 1 vegetarian savory crepe on their menu. Selection should be increased. They also serve all day breakfast crepes & sweet crepes.
They have sugarcane juice on the menu which is a delightful addition. (Not as sweet as the cane juices in India but good enough).
Service: Very friendly & welcoming.
Cleanliness: Open concept kitchen where food is prepared in front of you in a hygienic manner on clean surfaces.
Decor: Industrial chic.
Environmental friendliness: did not see any bins for recycling. 

Will I return? Definitely!"}
{"text":"Customer service isn't big in Toronto. That's the first thing that sets apart Muncheez. These guys make an effort to greet you, be friendly, help out and anticipate your needs, down to handing out wet naps for the messier orders. Everything's fresh and a pleasure to both see and taste. The hip dance music provides a welcome space in the rather small seating area. All and all a cool find in a rather unassuming location."}
{"text":"Muncheez has been on my to-try list for a long time! I wish I went sooner! The restaurant is located in the same area as a condo and small shopping centre. There is very limited seating and the restaurant set up reminds me of a Subway or Chipotle, with all the fresh toppings out on display

I was greeted by a friendly staff member who explained the different menus to me - there are 3 (all day breakfast, savory, sweet, or you can select your own fillings). If you're hungry and looking for a full meal, then get a savory crepe, otherwise opt for a sweet one. I got the Mama Mia crepe (Hungarian Salami, Spinach, Avocado, Mushrooms, Red Onions, Havarti Cheese, Chipotle Sauce). My friend got the same. The crepes were made fresh and came in a cardboard holder that you rip as you eat. It was very handy and kept things clean. The ratio of toppings to crepe was perfect. The crepe itself was fluffy and light. The fillings were all fresh and I especially liked the grated Havarti cheese. I got a bit of every topping in each bite!   

What I was really excited about was their sugar cane juice machine. I got the sugar cane juice with lemon. It was made fresh but unfortunately the lemon really overpowered the taste of the sugar cane. Next time I think I will just get the sugar cane juice on its own. You could also get other fruits mixed in as well like avocado or strawberries, which I find odd because in SE Asia it's best to drink the sugar cane juice alone or with a light squeeze of key lime. 

Overall I think it's a bit expensive for what you get, especially the sugar cane juice but then I am a little biased since I'm used to paying SE Asian prices for that. My entire meal of sugar cane juice and crepe cost me $20. However, I was very satisfied and the food was excellent so I will be back to try the other crepe combinations!

Parking can get really crowded in the lot right outside of the plaza so I parked in the underground parking just by the supermarket. It's free! There is also a small little park right outside with some seating, so you can enjoy your crepe outside."}
{"text":"How are these guys not a bigger fixture in Toronto? These savoury crepes are good to the last bite. Good food, free parking, and excellent staff are most definitely a winning combination!"}
{"text":"Came here on a weekend around noon, its hidden in the corner of a small plaza underneath some condos. The space is pretty small only a few tables but after a short wait we were able to snag a seat. They have plenty of options both savoury and sweet and I love breakfast crepes!

The crepes are built and cooked, the wait was a bit long for it but the service was very friendly and nice. The crepes come in a stand with a cardstock wrapper that you peel back. The crepes were nice and hot and had lots of filling, except mine had a bit too much yellow mustard for my liking. 

They were busy throughout the time we were there with lots of people also getting take out. Its a good place if you are in the area and in the mood for crepes. The price definitely adds up quick though but a great addition to the area."}
{"text":"Pretty good hood spot for some takeout. I recommend ordering ahead because everything is cooked to order and may take some time. I will say it is a bit weird inside. there is thick glass and an intercom that you have to speak through. I assume they had safety issues in the past. 

the food is good though. i've had the fish on a cheat day and it was delicious."}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant. Crepes are quick, tasty, and inexpensive. The sugar cane juice with fresh mint is delicious!"}
{"text":"Excellent service. Great little joint in richmond hill. Possibly the best crepes you will find in the city. Would definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"This place lived up to the hype! Great customer service, and delicious crepes with fresh fillings.

My husband ordered the \"Smoked Nemo\" smoked salmon crepe ($11.99) and I ordered the \"Madagascar\" falafel crepe ($10.99). The salmon crepe was on the thinner side in terms of fillings, but mine was massive and loaded with veggies. Both were delicious. We shared a 16 oz fresh sugar cane juice ($5.99) - pretty good. 

Service was quick and friendly - there was no room inside so we sat on the bench outside, and one of the servers came out to let us know that the bench can be converted into a table and showed us how. 

Looking forward to trying their dessert crepes next time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Muncheez, a name that does not adequately describe the tastiness, uniqueness or freshness of this fast food crepe experience! The quaint little establishment deserves some notoriety (and franchising if not already available). The staff was personable, efficient and polite. It's a gem hidden from street view behind a high rise. Try it!"}
{"text":"This place is very new, very cute and (most importantly) very tasty!! I get the vibe that they have an edge on healthy-yet-delicious menu options. For example, I ordered the watermelon juice (made in a blender with large pieces of watermelon...and nothing else...umm, yum!); I also ordered the New York Crepe, which was cheesy salty deliciousness! Stuffed with pastrami, pickles, olives, havarti and anything else you desire--this one is definitely worth a try! 

The seating isn't plentiful due to the size of the location (from what I recall there were three bar tables with a pair of bar stools at each), but I don't mind as I see this spot as more of a take-out craving/order-eat-and-leave kind of spot."}
{"text":"That was my favorite place in Toronto! Everything was fresh and different! My Crepe wrap tasted awesome and I totally enjoyed my meal there!"}
{"text":"I am glad i decided to make a trip to yonge and steele to find this new great place for crepes!  I visited this place with two friends during a weekday at around lunch time.  As I walked in, I really liked the place because although small, it was nicely decorated.  The owner, Ramin greeted us immediately and provided information on what is on their menu.  After reading over their menu, I decided to order a Philly Cheese Steak Crepe while I my two friends both ordered the New York's own.  To top off our lunch, I ordered the Ethiopian Coffee, and my two friends ordered the Sugar Cane Juice and Watermelon Juice.

The crepes were delicious, it was made to order and all the ingredients they used were super fresh and blended in well together.  The sauce I had on my Philly Cheese Steak Crepe really nailed it!  I managed to steal a few bites of my friend's New York's own and it was very good too, although flavor wise, the Philly Cheese Steak was stronger! 

What surprises me as well is how good their drinks are!  Maria (I hope I remember the name right) suggested I take the Ethiopian Coffee Black and I drank it black.  At first I wasn't too sure about drinking black coffee as I was afraid it would be too bitter, but i was WRONG.  The coffee was DELICIOUS in black!  It was not bitter at all and it was super smooth!  Perfect for a coffee lover like me!  I loved the Sugar Cane Juice as well, the sugar canes are imported fresh every Friday and you can taste just HOW refreshing the sugar cane juice was.  Perfect for a hot summer day!

After having such great savory crepes, we decided to try a dessert crepe and ordered the Berry World.  Strawberries and blue berries with nutella really did the job!  I thought the nutella was a little too heavy but it was still delicious!

I will for sure come back again!  A shout out to the owner Ramin for spending time and researching on making such great crepes and drinks! As promised I shared my great experience on yelp for you and I really hope other yelpers would make the drive here to try it out!"}
{"text":"Service: 5/5 (super friendly, attentive) 
Food: 4.5/5 (packed with fresh ingredients made to order! Their freshly squeezed sugar cane juice was out of the world)

First of all, I have to say that the staff (especially the owner) was super friendly and helpful. He would help you with ordering if it is your first visit. They have many savoury crepes as well as breakfast and dessert. You can also make your own crepe by choosing ingredients and sauces. I opted for make-your-own, and my boyfriend got a Philly cheese steak crepe. All the savoury crepes are at around $10-$14. They also make freshly squeezed sugar cane juice! The juice itself it $5.99, and you can add more toppings like berries, lemon juice, mint etc. We went for fresh mint as the owner suggested. It was SOO refreshing! Crepes arrived at the table piping hot. You don't have to hold them because they are served in a crepe holder. Although we were not starving, we just devoured our food. 

No wonder this place has good reviews! I mean I can't see anyone not liking this place."}
{"text":"One of the best places for savoury crepes, situated at World on Yonge, to the left side of the main entrance entering the mall.  The place sits about up to 10 customers, bar tables, comfy atmosphere, super friendly staff and great food! My fave crepe was the Pear Pie, which was from their specialties selection and the Santa Maria was very flavourful with the amount of meat it had.  Our crepes were served warm, easy to eat, the best part is, each crepe is quite balanced with enough veggies so it's not all just meat. I would love to try their sweet crepes next time, most of them have nutella as a spread,and you have a choice to top it witu berries, bananas, or marshmallows (depending on which one you choose).  Muncheez, you've got my vote for one of the best places for crepes in the uptown area!"}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, crepes made to order right in front of you. Excellent customer service, every item on the menu is skillfully put together. Will be coming back to try everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Great variety of toppings and combinations. The taste will really surprise you. Amazing, friendly staff and owner. 

P.S. Try the fresh sugar cane drink. Highly recommended as a refreshment."}
{"text":"Gotta try this place out!  My fiancé and I stumbled across this crepe place and decided to try it out.  The savoury crepes were so yummy!  We tried the Big Bird and New York's Own, so good!  Everything is freshly made in front of you,  the crepe itself was chewy.  The owners were extremely nice and friendly, we were given a sample of their freshly squeezed sugar cane juice.  Delish!  Must try :)"}
{"text":"This place is incredible!! The best crepes I have ever consumed!! Amazing vibes, wonderful staff, beautifully designed shop!! Definitely stop by here with an empty stomach and be prepared to fall in love with the greatest crepe place ever! And now open until 4am on Fridays and Saturdays!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday afternoon around 1-2 pm with 3 other people. There was only 2 other people in there when we went so it didn't take long to order and get our food. I got the philly cheese steak while the others got the black forest and the big bird. The philly cheese steak was DELICIOUS as the other reviewers said. However, the people I was with all thought their crepes had too much mustard but that may be just personal preference. I had a bite of the big bird and while I didn't think it was too mustardy, I also thought it was only okay. It was nowhere as good as the philly cheese steak. I'll probably go back to try the sweet crepes someday."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! I come here at least once a week. The owners are super friendly, down to earth and super sweet. They put a lot of working creating masterpieces of each and every crepe and put plenty of ingredients. They aren't stingy like most other places, you get your money's worth! 

The place itself is beautifully decorated and has a very relaxing vibe. Even though seating is limited, there is always a place to sit.

Both sweet and savoury crepes taste amazing. I have tried the mamma Mia the Philly cheese steak and berry world and each time I have gotten them, I have not been disappointed, they are heavenly. You can also add on or sub in ingredients. Even their tea and coffee is great. I love the goji tea, it is very aromatic and tastes amazing!

Every person I have taken to this place has loved it and the customer service we receive each time is impeccable. The owners know me by name, know my order and what I love.

You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I was there a couple of weeks ago, late at night for sweet crepes.
What i got from their menu is, they have a huge selection of Savoury crepes.

We got nutella crepes, and they were fresh and HOT! just how i like them. I modified my crepes to have nutell and nuts, and have honey on the side and they were glad to comply.
They serve in the cardboad so its kinda easier to eat.

It was definitely one of the best crepe i have had, primarily because it was really fresh and served hot. I will go there again and try their savoury crepes as that seems to be their speciality.

TIP: don't be decieved by the photos, the place has barely any seating space, definitely not good for groups."}
{"text":"The most delicious surprise! Not only is this place adorable but the food is amazing. Fresh ingredients, amazing savory combos... Obsessed! We are only in town for two days and will definitely go a few times to try out the different combinations."}
{"text":"All this time, I thought I was just not a fan of crepes; but in reality, I've just had badly made crepes. Muncheez is perfect for a light breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert and drinks, or late night snack (they're open till 11pm every day). Their crepes are thin and light with a slightly crisp edge filled with all sorts of flavorful and fresh ingredients. Totally customizable: starting at a base price of $2.99 and high as you want to go, or just order one of their popular selections.

Boy did I push the staff to their limits. I questioned them on everything. What's this? Baked falafel made from chick peas; they don't deep fry theirs. What's playing in the background? Lively Bachata music. Is your love lock art just art? No, you can ask them for a free lock (while supplies last) and markers and put up your own personalized lock. May I sample the crickets, may I have extra Dijon mustard for my New York's Own crepe, may I have an extra cup of ice to split my sugar cane drink? I was blown away by their response: \"Yes\" with a genuine smile.

4 stars for their food but they earn their 5th star for their hospitality and exemplary customer service. Show them some love by leaving a generous tip in their tip jar by the cash register."}
{"text":"From the moment we walked into this little place, we were impressed!  We were enthusiastically greeted and given a \"tour\" of the menu. There are delicious flavour combinations (chicken, walnut, pear and havarti / chicken, blueberry, maple syrup and cream cheese) - or ham and cheese or cinnamon sugar for less adventurous palates. 

Thanks Muncheez for the friendly service and yummy crepes! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place is the greatest, a real hidden gem. My wife and I found Muncheez looking for a brunch spot and lured by the pictures and the consistency 5 star rating out of 160+ reviews, we made our way from Scarborough. Now, the place is small, but it has big heart, you're greeted by the owner Ramen and staff walking in and he will explain the menu to you and make recommendations to you if it's your first time. 

The place is super cozy, there's a beautiful mural covering the whole wall beside the cash, the wall paper and decor is unique and interesting, a fenced gate (that's right) is hanging on the wall with locks on it (from customers?), Everything is made in front of you and you see the whole process from the start to the moment it lands on your table.

For the Coffee enthusiasts, the Ethiopian coffee is amazing, what a blend. As for the crepes, honestly, these were the best we've ever had, the ingredients were FRESH, the Mother Nature was amazing but the Smoked Salmon crepe was just indescribable, cheese and smoked salmon?! what more can you say. The sugar cane drink is unbelievable, you expect a overly sweet juice and it ends up being the smoothest thing ever. 

We loved the food so much, we stayed to grab another coffee, asked Ramen to surprise us with another Sugar Cane drink flavour (which ended up being avocado and better than the strawberry and banana), and grabbed the sweet crepes, Hardcore and Big Red, and definitely was not disappointed.

You can never go wrong with these independently run unique spots, but the highlight is the service, Ramen and his crew are amazing, and we wish them the best in their future endeavours. Definitely be back very soon."}
{"text":"An absolute hidden gem that is fast becoming a popular place.  Muncheez serves fresh savoury and sweet crepes, made by hand right before your eyes.  

I recently had a chance to finally visit this place and try them out.  I was able to talk to one of the proprietors (it's run by two brothers who are charming and a hoot to talk to) of this establishment and learned that they have been in business for less than a year.  Their advertising has strictly been word of mouth and they're fast becoming a place to definitely visit especially if you love crepes!

On my first visit I had the philly cheese steak crepes while my gf had the chicken or lil bird crepes.  We also had the fresh watermelon juice and Ethiopian special coffee.

It did not disappoint, the crepes were light, fluffy, not too thick but the right size.  It really was skillfully prepared, the batter was perfect. Seasoning was wonderful.   Portion was more than what I had come to expect from other creperies in the GTA.   The filling in the crepes were also fresh, and prepared daily by the staff and crafted before your very eyes.  I've since been back for that smooth Ethiopian coffee, and as well as the freshly prepared sugar cane juice!

Definitely a place to visit once or twice, maybe more for those who can't resist a crepe.  This place is definitely a take-out to go spot by the limited number of tables available for those who want to stay-in, which is perfectly understandable as it's a new venture. Perhaps a future location will accommodate to a more dine-in experience.

Until then, I'm definitely looking forward to my next visit to Muncheez!"}
{"text":"Quiet disappointed in this place. With all the high reviews I would have expected more.

I ordered the berry world crepe. It was flat in appearance. Didn't look how a crepe was supposed to be. Why put it in a cone when it's basically a crepe pizza??

 Taste was good, but if you add Nutella to anything it would be good no matter what.

I would not come back again. Disappointed considering the raving reviews"}
{"text":"Never thought I would like savory crepes but this place changed it for me. The ingredients were spread evenly making every bite perfect! Shows they pay attention to details. Will def go back for some more crepes!"}
{"text":"It's practically everything you want in a crepe. The savory crepes are what people come for. The owner was so friendly and gave us a rundown of what is in the menu and which ones are the most popular. He also gave us a trial of their infamous sugar cane drink fresh from Costa Rica.  

I tried their new York crepe and it was nonetheless delicious! As everyone has already said in their reviews. There's nothing I can say bad about this place. He was friendly and the crepes were made to perfection. 

I'll be trying their desserts next and trying what Kris got in his drink-- sugar cane, lemon and mint with ice :) mmmmm"}
{"text":"Little Bird is the way to go! Great place to grab crepes. Very friendly front staff as well. You can also call ahead to order over the phone before you pick it up!"}
{"text":"Always amazes me with their crepes and their exceptional customer service! They always greet you when you walk in and ask you if you've ever been here before. It's a fairly small restaurant but they are always packed with an overflow outside.

I love how many different crepes they have on their menu and ceases to amaze how they keep an inventory of so many fresh ingredients all the time. They pick your ingredients and make the crepe with such perfection and attention to detail. When the crepe has been folded up, they will attempt to pack more ingredients in to fill it up.

I always get a plain sugar cane juice, but more recently, they've expanded their menu to add fruits and flavorings which has caused a longer than expected wait time for a drink. However, once you get it, you'll me amazed that they fill it to the rim above the lid.

The last thing that gives me a really good feeling is that the owner or employees always ask each other if they need help or if they're ok. Such a great team to be apart of."}
{"text":"The crepes were tasty but extremely small IMO. Maybe this is perfect for someone looking to grab a quick bite but not as a full meal. It also seemed a bit pricey to me as one crepe is $11. 
I'd probably come back if I'm craving crepes but I'm there that that there's a lot of other food options."}
{"text":"I knew that Muncheez would be an absolute hit at my party, and boy was I right! They arrived an hour early to set everything up before my guests arrived, and were ready to serve with smiles on their faces from the very first to the very last minute. They were an absolute delight and our guests agreed. Each and every guest complimented me and them on how amazing their food tasted. They are by far the best catering service I have ever had with the freshest and most delicious tasting foods I have ever tasted. I can't thank them enough."}
{"text":"This place is the very example of great tasting simple food created with the utmost care. In this day and age it's very rare to come across an establishment that take so much pride in what they do.

Nothing here is innovative and forward thinking (except maybe the food packaging). They have not invented anything new or created anything that we've never seen before. But as soon as the crepe shows up at your table you will see, smell and certainly taste the difference it makes when you have someone who is so passionate about what they do. Every little detail is not forgotten; from the wrapper on the outside all the way to ensuring the crepe has an even distribution of ingredients from the first bite to the last. Nothing is overlooked.

The crepes are simply delicious; with fresh vegetables, meats and cheese wrapped in a perfectly cooked, crispy batter. This is by far the best crepe I have ever had.

This place is a gem and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"really nice place! went today with my family and we all had a great time. the crepes were delicious and very filling! definitely worth a try for everyone! also employees are super nice :) (their sugar cane juice is cool too!)"}
{"text":"I took my mum hear for Mother's Day. We ordered  the vegetarian option (forgot the name but it had beans) and it was delicious. The vegetables are fresh and the portion is so generous. We were stuffed but couldn't help but order a desert crepe which was amazing as well. The desert crepe had walnuts - wow! We would've ordered a meat option but we don't like cold cut meat. Perhaps in the future if they have grilled chicken it would be nice. Place is clean and staff is so nice. If you're there on a hot day you can sit outside on the benches."}
{"text":"High quality crepe sandwich. Taste fresh and delicious. It's better if you make your own that way you can make a lighter crepe. The wall art is my favorite perfect for that insta story"}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome crepes. Ordered the Madagascar and the Smoked Nemo. Both as good as it gets. Place is small, with few seats.. located in the World of Yonge mall near Yonge & Steeles. With limited visibility to the outside world, this place relies on word of mouth for its business... and it deserves every bit of its reputation. Prices are reasonable, crepes are big & tasty.. even my extremely picky 3 year old could not stop eating it :) Good job guys"}
{"text":"I got the 'Muscleflex' crepe. They use all fresh ingredients. This crepe literally melts in your mouth. Best crepe ever!! You will not be disappointed!
I also tried the fresh squuezed sugarcane juice with fresh ginger, lime and mint... very refreshing!"}
{"text":"That was a great one of the best experience for me. Very friendly and nice design, really delicious and also very friendly staff, 

I really recommend you to go to Muncheez, if you don't have any high blood pressure."}
{"text":"A friend took me here for lunch on a weekday. It's a small establishment and I loved it. They were so nice in helping me choose. I decided on a savoury crepe and it was just perfection. I definitely want to go back to try one of the sweet ones!"}
{"text":"Customer service was impeccable, decor is cozy; best crepe I've ever eaten.

The owner walked us though the menu, discussing his favourite menu options.

Had the crepe with Nutella, strawberry, and banana - the batter was incredibly fresh, and the fruits cut razor thin.

I'll definitely be returning soon."}
{"text":"Their crepes are good but not great.  They need to add more ingredients.  It's so small.  I like the T-swirl ones better.  They are much bigger and their crepes are not soft like these ones.  I would do the drive to T-swirl for their crepes even though I live closer to this place.  There's no place to park."}
{"text":"Can't wait to go there again.  Was my first time here but definitely not my last.  Not only was the food amazing, but the staff and owner was a pleasure.  Food is fresh. Everything is made right in front of you.  A lot of thought and care have been put into this menu.  My kid loved it as well. I have also told about 3 people already on how great this place is."}
{"text":"Finally visited Muncheez after driving a few times. We had the Lil Bird, Philpy cheese and Mamma Mia followed by sweet crepes, strawberries and Nutella, avacado marshmallows Nutella.  
We really enjoyed the savoury crepes. They're a tad bit crispy and are made to order. The little bird was our favourite so far, the aoili in it is amazing. The employees are extremely friendly and accommodating. They let us sample the cane juice, which was good.  They also took the time to explain some of their combinations and that we could make our own combinations if we wanted. Great service.
The sweet crepes were good, however I found the crispy texture in the sweet crepes a bit too much because the ingredients are softer and can be crushed or squeezed out when biting into it. They were really tasty though and I would likely go back for more.  
I'm happy I found this place. Can't wait to go back and try more!"}
{"text":"The service was excellent, where the guy was kind and helpful. I couldn't help but tip. The food was great, I ordered strawberry banana Nutella crepe and my boyfriend ordered the blueberry strawberry Nutella crepe. They were both delicious and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Muncheez had been on my go-to restaurant list ever since I saw their 5 star rating on Yelp! I wanted to see what all the hype was about, and sure enough I was able to experience the quality of their food first hand.

A foodie friend of mine had invited me to an outing at Muncheez to try out their popular crepes and to have a fun time with other Toronto foodies. The shop was quite small, but it had enough seats to accommodate customers and there were several people getting their orders to go, so seating wasn't a problem. The staff was extremely friendly and had the best customer service. They had an extensive menu selection including all day breakfast, savory and sweet crepes, as well as an option to create your own crepe.

I already had my eye on one particular crepe after seeing a picture on their Instagram. It was the 'New York's Own' which included pastrami, mushrooms, kosher pickles, red onions, arugula, Havarti cheese and mustard. The crepe was placed on a metal holder which made it very easy to eat considering how big and hot it was. Not only did it look amazing, it tasted delicious! I loved how fresh the ingredients were and all the different flavours went great together. The crepe was cooked perfectly, with a soft and chewy texture. I didn't think that the crepe would be filling, but I was quite full after finishing everything.

It's safe to say that Muncheez definitely lived up to the hype! With their fresh ingredients, beautiful presentation and amazing staff, I know that Muncheez will continue to be very successful. Next time I'm in the area, I need to try out their sweet crepes!"}
{"text":"Came here cause of the Yelp reviews and tried the veggie crepe. It was delicious and the owner was really nice! Would come here again for sure."}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW, this place rocks. I decided to try Muncheez out after reading  all the positive reviews. I was not at all disappointed. I started coming here several months ago and I think I've had about every crepe on the menu so far. The only thing is that every time I order a different crepe, its better than the last one I had which I thought could not be possible. You also must try my favourite drink, fresh sugar cane juice. I order mine with fresh mint leaves, lemon juice and ginger, totally refreshing, healthy and addictive. Ramen and his entire staff go  above and beyond to make you feel at home, I promise, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This gem is hidden in the street level of Shops on Yonge, and it's not facing Yonge; well hidden! I'm welcomed by the wall mural once I stepped in. It's captivating!! 
This place serves fresh crepe in both savory and sweet. I tried both; The Big Boy is made with delicious meat and fresh crisp veggie wrapped in between freshly-made-soft-warm crepe and Berry World is filled with blueberries and strawberries together with Nutella. The crepes here are more than fantastic; they are just creptastic!!

The sugarcane juice is good; it tastes great with or without lime or mint. The juice is made to order.  I saw my cup of juice reeled from the sugarcane stalk through the grinding wheels.  Both the taste and color are so natural!  The boss comes over twice to chit chat a bit.  He is friendly and cheerful. Besides the wall mural; I love their wallpaper as well.  The boss told me that the wallpaper is also done by the artist who did the wall mural, and it's unique!!  Come and find this well hidden gem!!"}
{"text":"I love all the crepe flavours I've tried so far. I used to be a visitor in Toronto and this was my priority place to go for food."}
{"text":"Always fresh ingredients and lovely staff. A great healthy (if you make it to be) alternative to other fast food stops. They have a diverse menu with a cool modern atmosphere to enjoy it in. The space is small so it may be hard to find seats at times."}
{"text":"I tried this place with my friend because I was so curious with people's reviews and i love crepe!!! So, I got the philly cheese steak savory crepe and it was good. And, had their sugar cane juice with mint which is very refreshing. It's pricey though. I got to pay $20!"}
{"text":"Taste great everytime i come here. The ingredients are fresh. The staffs are super friendly. They really make sure you are welcome!"}
{"text":"I've gone here a few times and I always leave satisfied. I've always enjoyed savoury dishes over sweet, so it's great that I get to enjoy savory crepes here. A couple of my go to are Philly Cheesesteak and Little Bird. All the crepes are stuffed with toppings and you can even build your own. I also suggest getting the sugar cane juice."}
{"text":"This place was DELICIOUS, I had the philly cheese steak with the sugar cane juice and I am definitely coming back ! Staff were super friendly and made the whole experience 5 stars !"}
{"text":"Awesome place to stop by for a quick lunch or snack if you're in the area!

We stopped here while shopping for a quick bite and were SO happy we did. We got Crepes:
-Santa's Omelette
-Big Bird

The Santa's Omelette was great if you like a little kick to your food. I love spicy stuff so this was great for me. The veggies were crispy and fresh, while the crepe outside was hot and steamy with melty cheese inside. The contrast was amazing. 

The service was great too. It's a small shop, and the owner's are really invested in making sure you enjoy the food to the fullest. They made sure to ask how it was, and really wanted to get our feedback on the food. This is great because you know they are putting effort into making the best quality meal for you.

I would recommend this place and wish they had a food truck of this downtown so I could get it for lunch :)"}
{"text":"I've been dying to try out Muncheez even since I found out that it's on the Top 3 of highest rated restaurants on Yelp, so finally I made the trip to experience what this restaurant has to offer.

Environment:
It's located at a residential plaza North of Yonge/Steeles, with many other restaurants around. However, even though there are free parking spaces, the park lot is actually very small, so you gotta plan ahead and avoid busier hours. 
I actually went for dinner at Muncheez and when I walked into the door, I quickly realized that this place is much more suitable for a breakfast/brunch/lunch quick grab. The store only had about 4 tables, in which only 2 of them can sit 4 people max, so for sure this is definitely not suitable for long stays. Also, the space was super tight and I found the high chairs to be very uncomfortable, so this is why I'm deducting a star from the rating.

Food:
Upon looking at the menu I was overwhelmed with all the choices they had. They offer many pre-arranged combinations of ingredients for their crepe rolls and you can choose between savoury or sweet crepes. I actually opted for the build-your-own option instead, because it was much easier to identify what's in the crepe and to judge how much you're spending on your meal. My order came down to about $12 after tax. I was delighted to find how gigantic the portion size of my crepe ended up being and it was definitely very filling even for dinner. One thing though, the crepe is quite messy to eat, so it's probably not a good idea to bring someone you want impress along to this restaurant. 
They also sell drinks as well, and they actually sell fresh sugar cane juice, which is a rather rare item to find in Toronto. Unfortunately, the drink costs $5.99 each, due to having to import the sugar cane. You can opt for getting water if you don't want to pay for any of the drinks, but keep in mind that they default at charging you for a bottled water, so be sure to specify that you just want the tap water. 

Service:
You order from the counter much like a fast food restaurant, and there's pretty much no table service after that."}
{"text":"The crepes are delicious, the staff is super friendly, and the sugarcane juice is a must! We shall return with a padlock."}
{"text":"Arguably the best crepe I've ever had. Came with some friends and found the food and decorations really creative. The staff was especially nice and gave us a tour of the menu as it was our first visit. I got the Marsh berry and enjoyed every last bite of it. For sure coming back for more."}
{"text":"Amazing savoury and sweet crepes! Exceptionally fresh ingredients. Super friendly service.  A great find, thanks to Yelp."}
{"text":"I get the Mother Earth Crepe every time - simply because it is THAT good.

The Nutella-strawberry crepe is gorgeous as well, but my sweet tooth is easily satiated with only a few bites. Their cane juice is so refreshing especially with a few sprigs of mint. 

Excellent customer service and kind owners! Prices are steep, but it's worth it as the food is tasty and fulfilling."}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp, I found this little place in the plaza of World on Yonge just north of Steeles.

I saw all the raving reviews, and happened to be in the area running errands and decided to drop in. The place is located on the outside, in the main parking area of World on Yonge. There is limited seating, 2 tables of 4, 2 tables with two seating and another section against the wall. So if your a very large party or expect a full dining experience this place is not for you - BUT I have to admit that this place is very definitely worth the stay and visit!

Upon entering you are happily greeted, and asked if you have been here before. If not, they walk you through how to order. They have a range of savory and sweet crepes with pre made combinations. If you are feeling a bit more adventurous or know your way around a crepe, then they will gladly put together a special combo just for you. 

They also sell freshly squeezed sugar cane (definitely recommended) where you can add an extra flavor shot inside ex mint or lemon (what we got).

I am not usually a fan of crepes, but I have to say this place pretty much exceeded all my expectations and then some.

The crepe comes out perfect, not too thick, not too thin. Strong enough to hold all the ingredients inside without breaking apart. You can watch them fill up your crepe with all the goodies - and fill it up they do. Upon first biting into it the savory flavors with the veggies and other ingredients was the perfect balance. 

I got the \"Iron Chef\" which consisted of Hungarian Salami, Black Forest Ham, Red Onions, Green Peppers, Green Olives, Spinach, Lettuce, Havarti Cheese,  with a dash of Mayo. The wifey got their special \"Dr Seuss\" which consisted of mushrooms, cheese and some other toppings I cant quite remember off the top of my head. We also got the sugar cane juice, one with a hint of lemon and the other with mint. The perfect balance to the savory crepes. 

The crepes were also very filling and you will not leave hungry from this place. 

I tend to gravitate to \"simple\" food, or as some would call it street food. I love finding little places that make simple things that are done well and not over the top, and this place is it. 

The crepes are served to you in a neat little wrapper. The wrapper is a bit stiff and thick so you can hold on to your hot crepe no issues. And the wrapper can slowly be \"ripped\" apart (its perforated) to help you make your way to the bottom of your crepe. Once you get to the end of the crepe, the pointed end happens to be sitting inside a small flattened wax cup. So as your eating, all the juices are neatly stored away in the cup and you can choose to drink it up or just throw it out. Either way I really appreciate this attention to detail as it was a very neat meal. They also provided some hand wipes, but these are not really needed as it was so well packaged that you could eat this while walking and no juices would leak out. 

I would definitely recommend this place and will be back again."}
{"text":"This place definitely lived up to the reviews, unfortunately it is hidden away on Yonge St.. The crepes were absolutely delicious and very filling! Customer service was amazing and super friendly. Will definitely be back regularly to try all the different varieties. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great selection of savoury and sweet crepes. I had one with Turkey and Pear and it was so good!
Definitely will go back to try more!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best new original things I've tried. 

  The crepe is thin light and crispy which really allows the the flavours of the ingredients too soak in and seep through.  

  They have fresh ingredients from deli meats too falafels too strawberries and you can customize your own crepe if you so choose.  
 
  Crepes seem too be better than pitas or any other wrap material I've tried, truly great tasting food.  I had the Madagascar."}
{"text":"The good: I must say, the highlight of this place was their sugar cane juice. I know they are more known for their crepes, but I felt they were just about average to me. They are good (for what it is). I must say what strikes me as the better experience in this place was the customer service. I guess maybe because they are small, they are friendly with their customers and really value your opinion. I didn't get a chance to really try their dessert crepes, so I would definitely come back to try that. Their savoury crepes taste exactly as the menu would indicate (I ordered the smoke salmon and well, it was smoke salmon, didn't get surprised).

The bad: nothing bad to note here

The ugly: nothing ugly either

Neutral: small place so super limited seating! May still be hungry after one crepe :p but that's just me and my big stomach."}
{"text":"Oh my god this place is so bomb! So my gf heard about this place from her friend and we decided to try it out today! It's located yonge and Steeles just north of Steeles and wow its the bomb. 

The food here are crepes! Not just your ordinary fruit or ice cream crepes, but savory crepes.  Yep that's right. So these savory crepes are like sandwiches, but crepe style! There's a lot of options for what to eat. Think of like a subway style crepe place just 3 times better! I ordered the p hilly cheese steak crepe and oh man it comes with roast beef, mushrooms, bbq sauce, cheddar cheese, arugula,  mustard,  jalapeños,  and maybe something else. That's all I could remember from the description. But imagine all that nice and piping hot! 

Definitely coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Still delicious, but I need to drop my score to four now that they are reheating the crepes."}
{"text":"Definitely a pleasurable experience and worthwhile after-dinner sweet snack! 
We would have tried the house-recommended savory but it was after dinner so we opted for special sweet crepe - Fuji. It was a blend of fresh berries, mint and coconut shavings. 
The crepe texture was soft, fresh and chewy.

What made this store stand out from a 4 star restaurant is the radiant decor, fresh ingredients and super friendly service! The owner/staff greeted us warmly and spoke to us about the selections; the fresh fruits, meat and vegetables were displayed in a very transparent manner, and loved the Nutella back drop!

Definitely one of the best crepe places I've tasted in the GTA - a 100% recommend!"}
{"text":"Healthy yummy choice in the area. Very good ingredients great people and great taste."}
{"text":"I love original crepes, and I love made to order savoury and dessert crepes even more. Located at Yonge and Steeles Muncheez offers a variety of savoury and dessert crepes. The service was very friendly and welcoming. Since it was our first time here the owner had given us a brief overview of their menu items. With many different combinations and options and even DIY crepes I decided to try the Smoked Nemo crepe which is a smoked salmon crepe while my friend decided to try the Philly Cheese crepe.

The Smoked Nemo crepe includes toppings such as smoked salmon, avocado, spinach, kalamata olives, spanish onions, jalapeno, dill, cream cheese. If you dont like spicy you can modify it and request for fewer jalapenos. I like how they prepare the crepe in front of you. The staff takes their time to make sure the batter is spread evenly with the wooden crepe spreader, then they apply all the toppings and fold it nicely into the paper crepe holder.

There is a good seating area there with maybe around 5 or 6 tables. Once we sat down the staff even brought the crepes to us in a metal crepe holder and wet wipes. She explained how to use the paper crepe holder where you can tear along the diagonal dotted lines and eat so you dont get your hands dirty. For a sort of make to order, take out, grab and go kind of place I felt that the service was very good.

**Time to tear and eat** 

The smoked salmon crepe was good and the cream cheese complemented it very well. The crepe was warm and I really enjoyed it. I tried my friends' Philly Cheese steak crepe as well and that was pretty delicious. In terms of toppings I would say the Philly steak is more filling and loaded than the Smoked Salmon one. I also found the Philly Steak crepe jucier as well. Both were very good crepes though.

I will definitely come back to try their El Paradiso crepe which is an avocado/marshmallow crepe!!"}
{"text":"My brother recommended to try this place out and I'm so happy he did! This place is honestly amazing, the food is just simply amazing. Prepared with fresh ingredients and is served hot / cold (depending on the type of crepe you order). I tried the Mama Mia, but I'll be sure to check out the sweet treats they have next time I go!"}
{"text":"Muncheez is one of those places that will create a craving for crepes that you never had, not until you try one of their tasty creations. And now that I've had their crepes about a dozen times, there are times when nothing short of one of their crepes will do.

They have a series of combinations that you can order, or you can just put together a crepe of your own. Lots and lots of different items you can add, everything from fruits (pear, blueberries, strawberries, etc) to deli meats to veggies and sauces. So whatever your craving, there's a crepe that will satisfy it.

In terms of size, what you get is slightly more filling than a slice of pizza. They give it to you in a specially-made cardboard holder that peels away to reveal larger sections of the crepe to munch on. They're cool people too, so it's a nice experience as well as good food. Parking is a pain sometimes, so we usually call ahead and pick up our crepe to go. 

Overall, a very positive and tasty experience. Definitely give it a try sometime, if you have a chance!"}
{"text":"Went to this place with my sister just because of the great reviews, and let me tell you, this place is OVERHYPED AS FFFF, service is decent but this crepes are really bland, no flavour whatsoever, i mean all i could taste was lettuce and tomatoes. For the price you get very little ingredients on your crepe."}
{"text":"An unexpected treat north of the 401 on Yonge Street, this cozy spot has fabulous savoury crepes, my son and I loved the Philly Cheesesteak and washed it down with fresh sugar cane juice.  

Wonderfully fresh and a very warm staff. I'm already looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Oh champ!! Love Little Bird and so delicious coffee!! Keep going for more delicious foods and drinks !!!"}
{"text":"This is more of a fast food creperie, and I think most people take their crepes to go. 

I ordered the Mother Nature crepe, which has a ton of healthy veggies and havarti cheese! The crepes come on a little holding rack, that I learned you're actually supposed to take with you. The crepe itself is wrapped so you can hold and eat it, rather than go at it with a knife and fork (though I'm sure you could opt for that if you preferred). 

I absolutely loved the flavours in the crepe and it was cooked so perfectly. If I had any sort of room left, I definitely would've tried another flavour! I definitely recommend this place and would go here again for sure the next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"The best crepe I've ever had! Stopped here for a quick breakfast before hitting the road. I highly recommend the mamma mia, but I'm sure everything on the menu is delicious! The owner seemed really genuine and looked like he put a lot of thought into the menu. He gave us free samples of the sugar cane juice, it was so good. I think one of the best parts about this place is how fun it is to eat the crepe with their paper crepe holder. You peel down as you go, it's so convenient and ingenious!"}
{"text":"Lots of choices for crepe ... whether savoury or sweet, they got it. We had the Good Morning TO, Mama Mia, Hot Stuff and Mouthfull. All 4 tasted great and fresh. Staff are friendly and the place is fairly clean. Having said that, it is fairly small and can only seat approximately 10 people inside. 

I only wish that they would have more choices for fresh fruit juices and more coffee variety than an \"Ethiopian coffee\" that is really just a coffee drip. 

We'll definitely come back and will recommend this place to our friends."}
{"text":"Love love love their crepe combination. One of our favourite regular hang out doesn't matter if you want sweet or salty they've got it all."}
{"text":"Finally decided to try this place and all the reviews were not wrong. Tried the philly cheese crepe.  Nice and light option and the crepe was filled with loads of meat and cheese.  Friendly staff that were helpful to guide us thru the menu.  Definitely will come back to try more!!!"}
{"text":"First time visit, got 2 crepes to go.. Nutella, banana, strawberry and blueberries as well as the big bird.. all I have to say is OMG!!!! YUMMY!!! Excellent staff, sooooo friendly. I will be back for sure, I'm already looking at the menu for my next choices. Great combinations, so much creativity. Got a cane juice to go as well, just the regular one, delicious!! There needs to be more of these places. I want to try every crepe!"}
{"text":"These are the best crepes that I have ever had in my whole life! If you are looking at their website, just be aware that they no longer have any of the salads (were not selling well), so they need to update that and also erase it off the board in store. 

I've been here twice so far with a group of three. They come in a holder so you don't need a spoon and fork. They even put an extra cup on the bottom to catch all the oils. If you're a vegetarian, don't worry that they only have one vegetarian option on the menu. This place basically lets you substitute ANYTHING. So just choose any of the pre-made crepes and they simply let you replace the meat with veggies (they even let me have two veggies I guess since meat is more expensive). You can also make your own crepe but so far I've just stuck with the pre-made options to be safe.

The sugarcane juice is also really good, a bit pricey though at $5.99."}
{"text":"I hired this team to cater a surprise party and it was the best choice ever. They show up with all the equipment and ingredients and make the crepes ON THE SPOT!!! They're piping hot and fresh. The team is professional and fun. I wouldn't think twice about hiring them again for another event. But beware they're addicting, you'll find yourself going here for something sweet anytime your craving something dessert like. I also love how they have savoury and sweet crepes to choose from."}
{"text":"Best savoury AND sweet crepes in Toronto!! My favourite is the Pearadise sweet crepe, so delicious. The sugar cane juice is also amazing."}
{"text":"On week days I sometimes like to go out with friends after work, and I was getting sick of Starbucks and Cafe Demetres. I am so happy I found this place! It's hidden away in a plaza and it's a small restaurant with limited seating, but it was not busy when I went at 8:30pm on a Wednesday.

The customer service here is friendly and helpful. The restaurant is clean, and they played lounge music...mainly artists that have done Pop song covers.
They have fresh ingredients, and they make their crapes fresh too. I felt like the guy making my crape was making sure my ingredients were spread out evenly instead of just tossing them in there and wrapping it up. I felt that made the crape taste good too because he made it with love lol kinda like how I would make myself a sandwich at home :D

I had a warm Smoked Salmon Crape which was delicious and flavourful with Sugar Cane juice -  which brought me back to being a kid :)
In the end I was satisfied and did not feel sickly stuffed. 

I will be back to try their other crape selections.
FYI: They might be opening a location downtown on King street ;)"}
{"text":"Good crepes and filling too. I had the little bird chicken crepe with spicy jalapeños and wife had the blueberry and strawberry crepe with Nutella. Very very friendly staff. The additives to sugarcane juice were good too."}
{"text":"Saw the great reviews on yelp and had to try this place out.  Always a bit skeptical when you see this many great reviews for a place, but after trying it you can see why.

Great service - especially when you say it's your first time.  These guy definitely kill it here! 

Great food

Great customizations

And, fantastic Cane Juice!

Only downfalls are:
- hard to find location, but it seems the best places always are, so that they can devote more profit to the service / quality of food
- no vegan cheese or vegan mayo based sauces (I.e. Vegenaise and Daiya cheese).  Suggestion:  carry it and charge a premium, but at least have a comparable vegan option)."}
{"text":"Wow I see why reviews are so high. It was legitimately good! I'm definitely a fan. How wonderful... now I can get my Sushi Bong, Muncheez and Love Me Sweet cheese cake fix at the same time!

Went here with my friends and we waited a while (25 mins?). They seemed understaff as orders kept being placed (either via uber eats, takeout, in person, etc.) and almost all the sit down tables were taken. However, it was definitely worth the wait. I never say this... I detest waiting for anything. 

We got a table right in front of where they make all the crepes and got to watch the art unfold. They were quite generous with their toppings. 

Ordered the El Pasido (marshmallow, avocado and nutella). It was delicious! The portion was quite big and the crepe had a little crispness to it. Plus the price definitely wasn't bad at all! There was so much nutella in there... oh boy! Yummy!

Personally, I feel they need a bigger space. 2nd location? Yes please!

Will definitely be back to try the savoury crepes!"}
{"text":"The service here is great and staff are always friendly. It's a small place but I've only been first thing when they open so seating usually isn't an issue. I can see them being packed during busy hours. Try their coffee (black). You won't regret it! The good morning T. O. is absolutely perfect if you haven't had breakfast yet. They let you swap items in the crepes if you're not feeling a particular topping. I just wish they opened earlier! Tons of parking free underground. The surface parking is closer but you are very lucky if you find a spot."}
{"text":"This place is great and always has amazing, delicious, and wonderful food! The crepes are freshly made and there are so many options to choose from. Everyone there is super nice as well."}
{"text":"Great spot for a quick bite, but for me personally, on the savory side, this is mostly cold cuts. I think the offering is delicious, but using cold cuts changes the entire experience. I'll be back once they start using freshly made ingredients, but till then, I'll avoid."}
{"text":"Such a lovely, unique crepery! Love the vibes and atmosphere of this small and cozy cafe. Staff are super kind; plenty of savory and sweet crepes to try!"}
{"text":"We ordered the steak+egg and New York crepes and were not disappointed. Both tasted great! The ingredients were super fresh. The mint sugar crane drink was very refreshing. The staff were very friendly and helpful. We'll be back again!"}
{"text":"Came here one night. Was super excited to try it but it was way overhyped. The food I could make myself. Would not come back again."}
{"text":"4.5 stars!

Followed the recommendation of Jackie, the bao and I finally made a trip to Muncheez at Shops on Yonge for some savoury crepes! I'm not a big fan of savory crepes but this place certainly blew me away. Definitely the BEST crepe I have ever had in a long while! Staff there were very friendly and welcoming. Crepes were reasonably priced. Highly recommend this place to you all :)

Ordered the Mother Nature (veggie) crepe to share. Lots of fresh ingredients used. They made their own crepe batter... healthier that way ^^ You can see how they prep and make the crepes with the open styled kitchen! The crepe was delicious, crispy and hot to the very last bite! I love how they presented it on a metal crepe stand... looked great and made it so much easier to eat.

The only con I have was the price of the sugar cane drink. $5.99 is expensive IMO. That's only because I grew up drinking sugar cane juice and it doesn't cost me that much lol. But I have to admit that the lemon was a very nice touch to the drink (+50 cents). I would still recommend it for those who have never tried sugar cane juice... it is quite refreshing on a hot summer day!

But yeaa, I'm so coming back for more crepes later, need to try the sweets! Who can say no to marshmallow & nutella? *drools* The bao said she can eat this everyday if they open one near her :D That means a lot lol.

Keep up the great work, Muncheez!"}
{"text":"They definitely have the best crepe in town. I tried almost everything on the menu and they are all lovely! Very fresh ingredients, nutritious and yummy!you can't go wrong with any of their signature crepes. I love their smoked nemo(only if you like smoked salmon), and their Madagascar (has flafel in it), Phily cheese steak(tastes like Persian style mushroom and meat pizza), and mama Mia. If you are vegetarian, you got to try Mother Nature. I only wished they had a dining area where you can actually sit and dine out.The place is small with a very nice decor, but only about 4 small tables and you feel that you should not stay there long. To sum up, imho, the best food in North York. 
They also have sugar cane and some edible insects, which I wanna try next time! Apparently they are good for you! :-)"}
{"text":"Great food, great spot, nice owners.. I love this place.. I've been here twice in a row... Tried the Philly cheese steak and big boy, both tasty, healthy, good portion and pretty cheap. For 9 bucks you get a crepe that is much much much tastier than a bs sub sandwich or alike.."}
{"text":"Fantastic savory crepes.  Was too full to try the sweet ones !!!   Traveling here on vacation and wasted to try some local crepes.  Came here based on the Yelp reviews, and am glad we did.  

There were 6 of us so we tried a variety of the specialty crepes and all were good.  Tasty, fresh ingredients prepared right in front of you.  If I lived here, I would become a regular!"}
{"text":"When my daughter craved for a nutella dessert, my pancakes and strawberries didn't make the cut on a lazy Sunday and I was quickly second place to Muncheez and their supreme creation of berry world.

The sugar cane with mint was refreshing and after the pep talk on how healthy it was by one of the staff, I was sold on anything minty that day after our shawarma stop earlier and my garlicky breath needed more quenching than water.

Will be back to try more savoury crepes whenever in the area."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time with my boyfriend. I haven't written a review on Yelp in a while, but this was definitely worth it. From the second we walked into this place, we were greeted like VIPs. Everyone was extremely welcoming and definitely made us want to stay. The menu was simple and clear. All the ingredients were written out for each crepe. The owner Ramin is very personable and a great businessman. He explained how everything worked and talked us into trying the sugar can juice. Oh my...we decided to add lemon and mint to it. It was soooooo good!!! Alongside our Philly cheesesteak and the banana, strawberry and Nutella crepes it was fantastic. 

I definitely recommend this place to everyone. We will for sure be back. The customer service from the entire staff is superb and the ingredients are fresh. Everything tastes amazing, so what more can you ask for? If you haven't tried it, go now!"}
{"text":"This is what happens when you have an owner who REALLY cares about the product and making customers happy. Having been here three times already, this place never ceases to amaze me. Amazing fresh crepes and a massive amount of sweet and savoury options male this place perfect."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite places to get a quick light lunch during the spring and summer time. They fill you up without feeling too heavy. My two favourites are the Philly Cheese and Smoked Nemo! The sugar cane drink is also really good, not too sweet either!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Best place to get a delicious flavourful crepe fast .. amazing staff who always welcome you like your home.."}
{"text":"Loved the 'Lil Bird savoury crepe! You can customize anyway you'd like - I got mine without olives and was delish. Friendly and inviting staff. Will return for sure!"}
{"text":"So good. I ate breakfast then came back for lunch then brought the gang for dinner. The food is amazing. The decor is inviting -- especially the wall art, which was painted by a local artist. And the people are wonderful. All three of the crapes I had were delicious. Special mentions to their sun-dried tomato pesto, watermelon juice and cane juice (get it with mottled mint, and watch the gizmo extract the juice). Seriously, go here."}
{"text":"Once you go in you will feel a very cool and chill vibe. The music in the room suits the interior designs of the place.

The workers are so nice. They would ask questions to try to accommodate the customers. 

The foods are just fantastic! I ordered the \"good stuff\" (banana w/ nutella crepes) and it was well served. Crusty and toasty on top. I was eating it only halfway through and I was already full. 

It was surprisingly affordable. It was so worth it. I will sure come back over and over again with my friends. 

The only bad thing was it can be crowded because it's a small place but other than that it would be the perfect hang out place."}
{"text":"I call myself the \"crepe lover\". Today, I had the best crepe I ever had at muncheez. (+ high quality service)"}
{"text":"This place lives us to its reputation on Yelp. The staff greeted us and provided us good service throughout our meal, even bringing us moist towelettes after we finished eating our crepes. The choices were a good variety, and all fresh and healthy ingredients. They really stuff the crepes, and we were all really full afterwards. The sugar cane drink was refreshing as well. I would definitely recommend trying this place out."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food here. I ordered the BigBird and my girlfriend ordered the phillycheese steak. Price was good for the quality of food you receive. The mustard in my crepe however allowed me to envision what it must have been to fight in the first world war. 
Definitely would recommend"}
{"text":"This was downstairs from our hotel and it was such a great find! It is kind of hidden in the shopping center and the name will throw you off but it was definitely worth checking out. I enjoyed it so much I had to go twice during my vacation in Toronto! The menu is very big and a lot to choose from. They have breakfast options, lunch options and even sweet crepes- which is always a must! 

I first tried the BLT crepe and it was very good- well made. Everything was cooked and prepared right in front of you and it was all fresh! 

On my last day in Toronto, I tried the the sweet crepes. It has banana, strawberry, blueberries and drenched in Nutella. SOOOOOO GOOOOD! The crepe totally hit the spot! It was warm, fresh and just took me to heaven! 

I definitely recommend this crepe spot if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Brought my family here to have the delicious Crepes. We received warm welcome from staff once we stepped in. 

We had Philly Steak, BLT, Mouthful (Blueberry, banana, strawberry) Crepes within sugar cane juice and black Ethiopian coffee. They enjoyed the Crepes very much; you enjoyed all the fresh ingredients in every bite. Sugar cane juice is very fresh and pure; nothing else is added and just only sugar cane. Ethiopian coffee is dark and with enrich flavour.  It was so good to drink it black to enjoy the pure taste. 

We got here just after 12 noon and the shop filled up quickly. However, they are pretty efficient too. Now they have an \"Express\" service to get your food ready quickly. Ask for Express if you don't need to see the \"show\" that how they make your Crepes. 

I am so glad that they maintain the service and quality consistently."}
{"text":"I can't make a crepe... I need this place.

It's a bonus that the food and service here is always excellent..

I only go for the sweets but when you want a change from your apple pie and ice cream or doughnuts....mmmmm

Bliss

You know the food is good when they encourage/dare patrons to review them.

Ps. I just phone and go, can't comment on the negative vibes others have mentioned about dining in..."}
{"text":"We were looking for a nice new place to eat out and we found this amazing place in the middle of a half empty mall. Talk about diamond in the rough. 

Everything is turned into a crepe which sounds strange at the start but when you actually see them doing it, it just looks tasty. They take real care into their food when making it and they have about as much variety as a subway so you can pretty much do whatever you want. They have some presets and I would suggest those to start. 

The staff was insanely friendly and nice. They went out of their way to make everyone inside feel welcome. You can tell they care about their clientele. 

If you are in area and are feeling like some interesting grub, try this place out."}
{"text":"Another way to enjoy crepe with hot meat and veggiesHave always been wanting to check out this place when first saw it on yelp! Good thing their crepes didn't fail my expectation! 

Highly recommend their philly cheese steak, the juicy steak tastes amazing with all the sauce inside! We ordered medium spicy which is the perfect level to still taste the food itself while having the spicy flavour added onto it. We also ordered another crepe from all day breakfast menu (can't remember which one was it) but that one was just okay, nothing surprising. 

Anyways, would definitely come back again for other flavours on the menu!"}
{"text":"This is an awesome place to go to for a tasty snack. It's also a beautiful place to hangout for a delicious desert. The latter is what we went in for.

As soon as we stepped in the staff greeted and welcomed us. Raoul especially went above and beyond. He asked us if it was our first time and once he found out he gave us a quick rundown of all the different things this place has to offer. 

We chose the \"good stuff\" off of the sweet treats menu. It was fantasic. No regrets.

I would definitely recommend this place to friends. Especially the warm service that it provides!!"}
{"text":"Great crepes place to fulfill any cravings! Tried the crepe with strawberries, bananas, and Nutella. They make it quick and they serve it in such a nice way! The packaging is very detailed as it gives you instructions on how it is supposed to be eaten. Workers there have high energy which makes for a positive experience!"}
{"text":"Best crepes I've ever had in TO. We had the New York's Own and Daily special (bacon, avocado, spinach, mushrooms etc). Expertly made, fresh ingredients well placed throughout the crepe. Cutlery not needed. Each crepe is folded to fit in a paper cone that keeps your hands clean. The pricing is at a good point for the potions. Very filling. Had to try a dessert crepe. Nice balance of banana, walnuts and of course, Nutella. Drinks were fresh sugar cane juice and a watermelon juice and tasty. Service fast and very friendly. Owner took the time to explain the concept and menu. Very personal service. Will definitely be back to try the others items on the menu."}
{"text":"Service- amazing service. As soon as I entered I was asked if it was my first time there. It was, so I was given the run down on how it all works and what they're known for (savoury crepes). Great, friendly and helpful service! Excellent. 

Food- I ordered the smoked nemo while my friend ordered tap out. Both amazing, light, healthy and filling!! If you're a fan of healthy eats and a great satisfying lunch, I highly recommend this place. It was packaged in a cardboard wrap that allowed me to eat without worrying about the crepe falling apart. The spread is on a separate layer than the toppings which made it quite easy to eat instead of sloppy like other places. Excellent presentation, flavour, and healthy! 

Drink- YOU HAVE TO BUY their sugar cane drink. I tried it with pear, which was very very refreshing. It is a little pricey, but worth every penny. 

Price range is decent for a great lunch!"}
{"text":"Feel bad for giving it a 4 but compared to all other food I've had it just wasn't a 5 star. Just considering the crepes scene though I would definitely give it a 5. Only 1 place I've had which had better crepes in Vancouver. 

We had two savory crepes. The big bird and Madagascar. Both were very good. The vegetarian one was more unique but the crepe itself was great. Chewy with tiny crisp. 

The sugar cane juice was delicious too. 

I also have to say it deserves extra points for very friendly staff and the innovative crepe holder which has cut outs to peel off as you slowly eat your crepe. 

Would definitely come again to try their sweet crepes but I don't see it being something I would crave for. Come give this place a try!!"}
{"text":"We love this place. Crepes are fresh and delicious. It's filling but nothing too intense. Would recommend the Mouthful (sweet) and the Smoked Nemo (savoury)"}
{"text":"We came here for a late night snack ! We had one savoury and one sweet crepe. Both was fresh and yummy! Would definitely go back ! They don't have many seats available however there are places outside you can sit and eat ."}
{"text":"Honestly the best thing. The workers were super friendly, and I think they might be the owners as well? Not sure. Walked me through the whole menu and made sure I picked what I preferred best. 

I made my own, and it was delicious. Mouth watering. 
I highly highly recommend this to anyone who hasn't tried before. I will also recommend to my friends. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is a very convenience place for me to pick up a wrap to go. I love their Philly steak wrap ($10.49+tax). Their smoke bbQ sauce goes so well with the steak and the crepes is made in perfection. The wrap is huge (at least to me), so not a bad option if you are lazy to cook and feel like something \"crepe-ee\"."}
{"text":"ONE WORD!   YASSSSSSSSS!

you must must must come to this place
The Crepes are made with perfection!  And it's in its own special cute holder Fresh and healthily AND GOOOD!
Owner is super nice!
Staff is very personable!
The CANE drinks are so refreshing !
Just visit. I promise you will be back
yummy!"}
{"text":"Food: 
Mother Nature crepe: 5 stars
Sugar cane juice: 5 stars
The Mother Nature crepe contains no meat but you will be full by the end of it. It doesn't look like much when you get it, but they definitely did not skimp out on the filling. I vaguely remember my crepe having spinach, avocado, some sort of salty cheese, basil pesto?, and olives. Honestly, it was REALLY good. Their menu isn't very big but they have a lot of good choices for savoury crepes. Sweet crepes have pretty standard options but you can always choose to make your own as well. The crepe itself was crispy on the edges but as you work your way down, it gets soft and chewy. Prices are very fair for what you're getting. The Mother Nature crepe was around $10 and most savoury crepes range from $12-$14? Sweet crepes started at around $6 and up to $10. 
Apparently, their sugar canes are flown in every Friday from Costa Rica! It's $5.99 for a medium-sized cup of sugar cane juice. It only comes in one size. Mint leaves and lemon juice is recommended for your sugar cane juice. It's an extra $0.50 per additional topping. I didn't get it with the mint leaves and lemon juice but I guess I would suggest it since the sugar can juice alone was VERY sweet...duh? Luckily I had a bottle of water with me so I was able to water it down. 

Ambiance: 4 stars
It's a very small shop so take-out is recommended but my friends and I decided to dine in. It's not a very comfortable place to sit and chat for a long time but still nice that there is the option to dine-in. Love the wall mural and all the colours. Chic little crepe place.

Service: 5 stars
Even though it's a small little shop, the gentleman who made our crepe still took the time to come over and see how we were doing with our food. There was also a lady working there and she gave us some recommendations and specialty items they are currently serving. Great people running a great place!"}
{"text":"The crepes tastes very good and served very soft and warm. The prices are kind of ridiculous for an average sized crepe. They have sweet and salty crepes and usually they don't take long to make so the wait isn't bad at all."}
{"text":"Came here on the recommendation of notable Yelper Cherrie T. Although it took a while to come around and actually try this place, she was spot on as usual - this place is great!

As others have mentioned, it's a bit small and cramped, meaning there is a bit of a wait on most nights, and not much space to sit. On a summer day this isn't a problem at all, as one can easily grab their crepe to go and take a short walk around the Shops on Yonge. On a cold winter night however, I found myself hoping that this place expands its size a bit!

Hopefully this happens because the crepes here are amazing. We had already had dinner so we passed on the savory crepes, despite some impressive options available. The sweet crepes also offered a lot of different options - you can can go with their \"signature crepes\" or build your own. 

I chose to build my own crepe, going with nutella (of course!), graham cracker, blueberries, and icing sugar. I was quite happy with the combination I went with, but may go more adventurous next time. These crepes had a bit of heft to them, as this place did not try to be stingy with their toppings. 

I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place and am definitely a regular! The Hot Stuff is my favourite but the Philly Cheesesteak is also great too. If you are looking for a filling meal at a reasonable price I would highly recommend. Great to eat on the run, call ahead and they will have it ready for you. The owners are super nice too!"}
{"text":"Five star service for a take out place. Yes there are about 5 small tables you can sit at, but this place is mostly used to take out. Walked in and the person at the counter was extremely friendly, explained what the restaurants all about and how they get their produce, recommended a few things and told us to take our time with our decision. We got the philly steak and the falafel crepes, both were extremely flavourful and delicious!! We had to get the fresh sugar cane juice they offer there. Got it with lemon and mint for that Mojito taste. Overall, excellent service, excellent food. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place is suuper highly rated.. and I can see why. The owner (?) was really friendly and walked through the menu with us, and he seemed to genuinely care that we enjoyed our meals. I got the smoked salmon crepe and it was very flavourful and even had a bit of a kick. Definitely recommend it! Also, just a note that this place is kind of hidden in a plaza a bit north of Yonge/Steeles.. across the street from the Yonge-Steeles Ford Lincoln."}
{"text":"Great crêpes for a decent cost.  I'm really interested in their savoury crêpes as well, because it seems to be showcased more as a deli than a place for dessert though they certainly have no shortage of sweet options. Seating is somewhat limited here though I've only been during mid-afternoon hours so I'm not sure how crowded they get. The staff are friendly, supportive, and efficient. They take your order and get started right away. 

I've had their Apple and Honey crêpe ($5.75) before and have tried other custom-made ones. You do not feel disappointed with the amount of toppings included because every crêpe is full of whatever you ordered. You won't get an \"empty\" bite of just crêpe nor would it be cold. It's my favourite crêpe restaurant and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great crepe selection with a great personal touch by the owners Ramen and Rez who make you feel right at home. The savory crepes are not to be missed (Big Bird, Little Bird) as the ingredients are fresh cut in front of you and delicately woven into their signature take-away crepe holder. 

Don't forget to try their Ethiopian brewed coffee!"}
{"text":"Savoury crepes are great portion and delicious. It takes about 5 min to get your meal, so be prepared to wait. You can also call in advance and pick up the order. I sampled the sugar cane juice and I'd try it again on my next visit."}
{"text":"The crepe was fresh make.. Big size and yummy..
Love the sugar cane juice, very fresh. 


They don't have many table for dining.
Mostly for take out. 

Customer service is so good too 
Recommend"}
{"text":"A bit pricey but the crepe is really good here!
I've had a couple crepes from here and to be honest, I think all of then are really good.
And their sugar can juice was fresh.
Would definitely repeat."}
{"text":"The Good Stuff ($6.50) Banana and Nutella, the 2 favourite things I like in my crepes. I am glad that Muncheez agreed with me.

I like the crispness of the crepe itself and the soft chewiness once I started eating it.

There seems to be a lot of call in orders as wait time can be long even when I was the only customer inside the store when I walked in. 

Sugar Cane Juice freshly made when ordered but at $5.99. 

I will be back to try some savory crepes next time."}
{"text":"Went in for an afternoon snack - wasn't terribly hungry so I got a strawberry Nutella crepe and their notorious sugar cane juice (just plain, but my cousin got it mixed with avacado and it was absolutely amazingggg. ) my crepe was fluffy and fresh - I'll be sure to go back to try their savory crepes next week! another cousin of mine tried their avacado marshmallow Nutella crepe - sounds weird right? but he assures me that it was worth it! They put a lot of work into their crepes. All the ingredients are laid out evenly and a lot of care is put into each crepe :)
What really made the experience was the customer service. They were super friendly and excited to explain their menu items. They possess all the qualities that will set them up for success... and my next visit! :)"}
{"text":"This lovely corner store is known for building your own crepe. I built my own with baked falafel, double corn, tomato with extra, triple sauce. I wanted to put avocado into mine, but the extra cost of $2 for avocado threw me off. 

The servers were wonderful and ready to answer any silly questions we had. The crepe itself was delicious and right, i asked them not to cook too much, i like mine softer. It was cooked to the right crispness.

My friends ordered pre-built recipe, which i think actually is more cost efficient, if you are indecisive and greedy like me who wants to put everything in your crepe, its probably worth to pick the pre-built menu or the everything crepe of $12.99.

A major disappointment is the meat they use are cold cuts, seems like Subway has better proteins option than them."}
{"text":"I thought it was excellent.  Great service and delicious crepes.  I thought the crepe holders and packaging was quite clever and thought-out"}
{"text":"Delicious Créperie with a wide selection of sweet and savoury crepes. Went for the #OrderTheYelp 'Yelp Crepe' which has bananas, blueberries, chocolate, coconut and maple syrup which causes your heart to say HELL YEAH and HELL NO at the same time. Incredibly delicious and the staff was super nice, always talking to each customer no matter how busy they are.

Only problem is the location. Near a strip mall in between condos in a square but the parking is not that great unless you want to do the underground parking lot, in which case you have to deal with crazy shoppers almost hitting you constantly. Although the location is questionable, the food is unbelievable."}
{"text":"Came here because of the amazing yelp reviews... a perfect 5 star rating! After eating dinner, I stopped by and had a dessert crepe, \"The Good Stuff\". It had marshmallows, nutella and graham crackers. The crepe was crisp and delicious. Definitely want to come back another time and try their savoury crepes!"}
{"text":"Been here several times for a quick healthy delicious bite and it never dissapoints. They have lots of variety in toppings you can add whether you like savoury or sweet. You can also customize your own crepes. I'd come here more often if it were closer to work."}
{"text":"The sandwiches here live up to the ratings hype.  They use fresh ingredients and the service is great. I noticed the are number 1 in the GTA.  I don't know about that designation, the foods good but they make crape sandwiches, if yelp had a rating for best crape sandwich place, then this #1 rating would make sense.  Not taking anything away from muncheez, I liked it.  I just think yelp needs some improvements."}
{"text":"I was on the way home from hockey and feeling pretty damn hungry. My buddy said he had a place to try and didn't want to say much more. He said listen - its crepes. But you gotta trust me. I am not really a big fan of crepes and, honestly, had some serious doubts about what I had signed up for on this very hungry evening. I crepe you not! My friend was right - and I've now asked my family and friends to just TRUST ME and try these crepes. 

It is rare to find a food spot doing something totally new. Muncheez is doing just that. All the staff are so proud of the product. The fresh ingredients - meats and cheeses - veggies - fruit. The novel flavour creations - Edamame with Avo and chicken!? Oh yeah - you can bet your crepe that they went there!! 

I have been back a few times. Never disappointed. So glad to find a diamond in the rough like muncheez. A creative approach to making delicious savoury treats. I have yet to try a sweet crepe - maybe one day... but the savoury ones are so freaking delicious. The world would be a better place if Subway went out of business and Muncheez took over. Don't let the crepe concept throw you off - this place is worth your time and has established itself as a legend in Thornhill!

Ps - check out that cool and intuitive packaging!!"}
{"text":"I brought my hubby and 19 month old baby to try these crepes on a Sunday evening. Food was good ( 3.5 stars), service was good (3.5 stars), space was awful though (1 star!!). It is not baby friendly at all, high table/chairs and no baby chairs ( which a big downside). Music was soo loud that my baby was getting anxious and fussy, definitely not coming back with her again. Take out wouldn't be a good idea as crepes taste better when warm, otherwise they would get soggy at the bottom like mine did while trying to calm the baby. 

About food- crepes are no different than any other crepe places but this place offers lot of variety. Another big downside is the price, it is bit pricey ( we bought 3 crepes and 2 drinks- total $45). 
Maybe we might return again on our \"date night\" without the baby."}
{"text":"I really like this place! My friend recommended this place for lunch after working out and we were super glad we did! Everyone who went really enjoyed what they ordered. We all ordered savoury crepes and a sugar cane drink. 

The sugar cane drink with banana was the most popular amongst our party and was well received. I tried a little bit of my friends and it tastes like a banana smoothie! I ordered sugar cane juice with mint which was very refreshing. I would definitely recommend trying one of the sugar cane drinks as it is quite unique to the store. 

In terms of savoury crepes, I really liked what I ordered as well. I had a \"make my own\" take on the smoked nemo (which I didn't want olives, onions, and jalapeño peppers) since the cashier told me it would be cheaper to make my own then to order the smoked nemo and take everything out (glad she told me that!)... I just wished that there was a little bit more of the ingredients (in terms of quantity) in my crepe as mine looked a little skinny compared to my friends who ordered premade crepes and I wasn't full after eating it. I really liked that the ingredients were very fresh. Note since each crepe is made to order, be prepared to wait for yours if there is a queue in front of you. 

Nonetheless, despite thoroughly enjoying my food I felt that the place was on the pricier end as the crepe and drink came out to almost $20. For $20 I could go to a sit down restaurant and have a filling entree. Regardless, I'll probably still return as the service was super friendly and the food was really fresh and yummy. I also though the love locks gate decor was super cute. 

My friend said that the owner is super passionate about the place but unfortunately I didn't get to meet him."}
{"text":"I loved this place before the new menu change in late may 2016. Seems like since the new menu the price increased for items by $1.50. I understand that a business may need to increase the price once in a while but they also removed ingrédients the little bird and big bird had bacon before this was replaced with tomatos. Not only that but it seems like it was filled with lettuce and tomatos I could not taste the cheese or other ingrédients like I could previously.

This place does not deserve a 5 star rating any longer.

Just to add I have ordered from here about 10 times over the past year. I may still visit but not with the frequency I have previously."}
{"text":"Ingredients is very fresh, large portion, taste great! Friendly staff. Too bad the seating area is small, 5 tables, meanly take out service. Notice they don't have washroom in the unit."}
{"text":"Great place for take out. Not much space for dine in. It's definitely filling for say lunch? I had the big bird. Would've been nice if the turkey weren't cold cuts though. I would give it four stars if it were. I will be returning to try the sweet crepes!"}
{"text":"I was browsing through the new and hot section of restaurants on Yelp when I thankfully stumbled across this page. Based on the reviews past customers had written about this place, I had to come try it and bring some friends along of course! 

Tip: the parking directly outside of the stores on the main level is for 20 minutes only so I would suggest taking advantage of their free underground parking! 

When my friends and I originally entered Muncheez, I honestly was shocked to see how small the entire place was. Granted, it is decorated in a very wonderful way and takes advantage of all the space it has in doing so. Their menu can be easily found displayed across the bar with a description of everything in each type of crepe. I found this very useful as I ordered the Big Bird I believe. I myself, did take the time to read what ingredients were added to my crepe but did not expect the pickles to be so sour! That was the fault of my own, but I know better next time to ask them to omit it based on my own preference. The Dijon Mustard really has a kick to it which I loved but others may not expect.

An added bonus is how friendly the staff was to us as new customers. They took their time to explain how we could add/omit ingredients to the crepes we were ordering and how they are made. The male employee asked how I had stumbled upon this place to which I happily replied, \"Yelp!\" After we had ordered our food, one of the employees drew our attention to the machine that pressed the sugar canes that created their sugar can juice. She then brought us some samples of it for us to try. I personally don't like sweet things so it was not for me but I truly did appreciate the sentiment. 

Overall, a great experience! The crepes they make are so big and filling that within the first few bites, I knew it was worth the value I had paid. Make sure you either come early or order ahead of time since the amount of seating they have is limited. I will definitely be back!

Visited on November 13th!"}
{"text":"This was it. Five stars on Yelp and one dollar sign? This was too good to be true.

Upon arriving at Muncheez, I was blown away by how friendly and welcoming the staff were. They approached us with accepting smiles and gave us almost a brief tour of the restaurant: stories about its history, where they source their ingredients, and a thorough description of their menu. We had only been in the small and cozy store for three minutes and my mouth was already watering again (this was right after a heavy dinner at a local restaurant). 

The restaurant is a really cool concept. It's small, and they have a column of high-elevated seats and tables, and the lights are pretty dim - a modern, hipster vibe.

They have both dessert crepes (some options had bacon? walnuts? avocado?!?!?! hell ya) and savoury crepes (eggs? steak? MORE AVOCADOS?!?!?!). We opted for the (I am totally embarrassed for forgetting the name), but the one with the nutella, strawberry, and walnuts. 

The crepe batter was absolutely stellar. It was baked at the right temperature, and the additional toppings elevated what was already an amazing crepe. Not to mention, the staff were very patient (patience definitely required for the many menu options available), which was a big bonus for me.

Overall, definitely will return to try out some savoury crepes! Thanks Muncheez!"}
{"text":"Visited about a month ago and got a savoury crepe (Big Bird) and a sugar cane juice. I thought the crepe was reasonably priced at $8.50 but the sugar cane juice was overpriced at $5.99 (plus $0.50 if you want to add fresh mint leaves). Staff were friendly and the food was good, but I wasn't blown away."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for sugar cane juice with mint in it, which is really refreshing. I usually get the Nutella banana crepe which is perfect in its size, taste and texture. Even though the sugar cane juice is over $6 and the crepes are a bit pricey as well but they are surely worth it. The friendly staff is always a plus point."}
{"text":"I sought this place out mainly because of it's excellent reviews and they definitely did not disappoint. Both the sweet and savory crepes are excellent and I love the packaging! Everything's clean, made right in front of you and the staff is SO welcoming and friendly.
The sugarcane juice was really new and refreshing as well. 
They're also open a bit later than other places which was awesome. 
Me and my friends will be back :)"}
{"text":"Great place! The staff was super friendly and welcoming. It was yummy and easy to eat. I had a Philly cheese steak which was amazing but I would have enjoyed it more if the onions were caramelized or fried. The sugar cane juice was also a great recommendation. Everything is a bit pricey for what you get and the place is a little hidden but it was a good experience and I hope they will open more locations."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, customer service even better. Small joint with a cozy feel. Very clean and organized. The staff took their time to explain things about the menu. Will definitely be back to try other items on the menu. 

Well done!!"}
{"text":"This place is honestly amazing. Not only are the crepes delicious, but the customer service is top notch. I also love the sugar cane juice here. I've grown up drinking sugar cane juice, and this is definitely the best in Toronto. Come here!! It lives up to its rating."}
{"text":"This creperie is located inside Shops on Yonge plaza; specializes in crepes and more crepes: savoury and sweet. Crepes are very well done, perfect thickness and texture. You can choose pretty much any toppings to put in your crepes. They have set selections or you can build your own. The toppings are fresh. I love how the inside ingredients stay warm throughout the meal. Crepes come in a stand making it super easy and comvinient to eat.  

We tried the Philly cheese steak (note that it's roast beef not steak in it) and New York's Own. Both were delish; the New York was on the spicy side as there's mustard and horse radish in it; crispy bacon was a nice touch. We enjoyed both. 

We got the famous sugar cane juice; it was sweet and refreshing, remind me of the time when I was in Asia. Juice can be expensive when you add the extra toppings (mint, lemon, avocado, banana)."}
{"text":"Great place! We go there all the time. Very conveniently packed crepes with surprisingly versatile variety of flavours and rich taste. We have not tried all of them yet, but we are working on it. They all taste great so far."}
{"text":"So happy my sister & I decided to try this place out! It was honesty better than we had imagined... The best savory crêpes we've ever tasted!! I had the Lil Bird & my sister had the weekly special. They were sooo good & filling! We also tried their fresh Sugar Cane juice that is made right in front of you & their fresh watermelon juice. Both delicious. The staff were unbelievably friendly & informative also. Now I need to try their sweet dessert crêpes which also look delicious next :D"}
{"text":"Overall okay.
Not great.
I had the 3 piece perch, it was a bit dry; but okay, the fries was great.
Wife had the chicken Philly, she said chicken Philly was decent; but dry; maybe a special sauce could moisten it up a bit.
I would probably go back for the cheesecake or a steak Philly."}
{"text":"Blue Jays crepe = the bomb dot com

Cream cheese, blueberries, walnuts, and the good ol' Canadian Maple syrup, and what else do millennials love more than avocado? All packed into the most perfect crepe ever created on Earth. This is definitely what heaven tastes like.

Would love to come back here and try their sweet crepes too! 

*Insert a bazillion heart eyed emojis thinking about this crepe*"}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday Brunch. Ordered the Monti Cristo with jalapeño- quite possibly the best breakfast crepe I've had north of the 401. 
Service was awesome- the staff were really friendly. Prices were reasonable. The menu is extensive...and the ingredients are super fresh. The decor is eclectic and quaint. 
I would highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I decided to look for something new to try and came upon the many positive reviews of this place. We are from Markham so we made the drive and let me say we were not disappointed! My daughter, a finicky eater, who said originally that she didn't like crepes at all, ordered the Berry World crepe and enjoyed it immensely. I had the Tap Out and it was absolutely delicious. We will be back to try the other offerings. If I had one thought on the negative side, it would be that there is not enough seating for me to invite a large group of my friends to enjoy a meal there.
This place is a gem. Thanks folks!!"}
{"text":"This is a good crepe place if you are near Yonge and Steeles area. They have both savoury and sweet crepes. Location is convenient with lots of parking both ground level and underground. Some seating area is also available. The staffs are very friendly as well. I find this a bit of healthier alternative if you replace it with meal!"}
{"text":"This a great unique dinner and dessert option for anyone in the area. You're probably thinking 5 stars and over a hundred reviews? Is it worth it? The answer is: yes. Muncheez specializes in mainly savoury crepes but the dessert ones are great as well. 

Service was 5/5. The owner was very friendly and cared very much about our experience without being overbearing. He explained how to eat the crepe using the clever packaging and explained a few things as it was our first time there. The decor was very cute and the place felt EXTREMELY CLEAN. They even provided hand sanitizer and wet wipes for us. 

I custom made my savoury crepe and that is probably the way to go if you're a picky eater like me. The prices are very reasonable and some of the preset ones were basically the same price as the one I made. It was so good that we had another crepe that was dessert based. The savoury one came to $13 and the dessert was $10. The savoury crepe is just the right portion; full but not too full. 

Muncheez was a very positive experience and I recommend to anyone that wants something unique and custom made!"}
{"text":"I want to take this shop home!! It's so good, makes me want to cry. I had the philly cheese steak and I stand convinced that this is the best savoury crepe I've had yet. There's just enough toppings (evenly spread too!!) to get to the bottom of the cone and they definitely don't cheap out on the meat either! Same goes for the sugar cane juice!

Service was so nice; the waitress greeted us with smiles and was super friendly, introducing to us the shop as it was our first time coming. She introduced to us the menu and how it worked. Lastly, the crêpier brought our crepes out to us and even explained step by step on how to eat them (you peel from one end to the other to get rid of the paper cone). This was probably the best stumble I had since years ago! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing and savoury crepe combinations...their nutella crepe creations are to die for and add a sugar cane juice for a healthy yet deliscious combo...."}
{"text":"Raman and Maria are great people, hard working, down to earth, great to chat with and gets bonus points for letting me in early.  Fantastic decor with repurposed wooden panels and shelves that gave a very modern vibe.

I had the New Yorker:
Cured meats with pickle and hot mustard, very nice kick.

Wife had the Philly Cheese Steak:
Cheese, steak, and jalapeno.  I m salivating just thinking about it...

Can't wait to go back to try out those sweet crepes with that awesome coffee, and to meet the third musketeer.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Small little crepe shop that sits around 20 including the benches outside the shop. Everyone that works there has been amazingly nice during both visits. If never been, they will take the time to explain the concept and menu. They're really flexible with changes to the menu or there's an option to create your own crepe.

Watching the whole crepe making process felt very therapeutic. It was very exciting to watch from the other side of the glass. Surrounded by fresh ingredients, a lot of care was put into assembling each individual crepe. Watched as the crepe maker put one ingredient at a time in a certain order and making sure the final product was presentation worthy.

Served in a custom paper cone with ripping instructions, the crepe comes to the table piping hot. Because of the careful placement, each bite will have a bit of everything. Tried the Phillycheese Steak and Mama Mia, both were good in their own way. The first had a sweet tangy BBQ sauce and the vegetables was cooked just right. But the second one was the one to get again, the cooked salami had this extra meat oil that made the crepe taste extra incredible !

Overall, came for the past two Saturday's so will definitely be back for more ! Only downside is if there's a lot of people ahead of you, the wait time can be pretty long."}
{"text":"I had never reviewed a single restaraunt before entering muncheez deli creperie restaraunt, because non left such a strong impression on me. I had ordered the Philly cheese steak and it was one of the greatest things I had ever tasted. Typically, I would never expect to experience such an extraordinary service and taste from a restaraunt that is this affordable, how wrong was I. If you're ever in the area, make sure to pay this place a visit and your respect, because you will possibly never experience such an amazing service and food from such a talented staff and at such a low cost ever again."}
{"text":"One night my boyfriend and I were hungry and too lazy to cook so we went to Yelp to help us out. Yelp usually suggests the same places in my neighbourhood based on my location but we noticed something..this place Muncheez had 5 stars I was so confused I had never seen nor heard of this place in my life!

So we read some reviews, all amazing, both agreed that we'd never tried savoury crepes but we were willing to give them a shot so off we went to Muncheez! Which is by the way in that little new complex off Yonge area when you're headed south it's just before Doncaster/Golden Star :)

There's 20 minute parking outside or underground but if you're awful at underground garages like myself I'd take a chance and stick to the 20 minute because I had lots of trouble getting out of that my first time!

Anyhoo, when we made it in we were welcomed by the 2 guys that own the place, both really really nice, energetic and welcoming. When we told them it was our first visit they explained to us how everything worked and made some great recommendations, my boyfriend ended up ordering one of them! 

I got the little bird- it came with sliced chicken, avocodo, black olives and more goodness that I can't remember but the sauce was fantastic- I think it's a garlic mayo. My boyfriend got the breakfast one which was one of the recommendations. 

We've since been back a few times since and I've been with other friends- I got the big boy my second time, it was delicious but I can tell that the little bird is my go to :) Another thing is that they have a build your own that I think includes one meat one cheese and 3 veggies and it's regular price not like those places where you pay per item so that's another thing to make note of!

They also do fresh watermelon and sugar cane juice. So far we've tried watermelon and it was fantastic!

It's a really neat little place, there's not that many tables but we've never had a problem getting one. I also love the decor. They have a mini fence on the wall with locks on it like the bridge in Paris. Last time we went we brought one with our names on it- the owners also remember us, really great guys!

Can't wait to go back- I've been telling all my friends about it!"}
{"text":"Food was great customer service was a joke ... I prob should've given 2 but again the food is good"}
{"text":"I was traveling in Markham from Texas. Had NO idea where I wanted to go for lunch. Did a Yelp search and this place came up. Now, I love crepes. The fact that the reviews were a unanimous 5 stars, I had to check it out. I ordered the Moroccan, which is the falafel crepe. It was delicious. Fantastic even. I wish I had the opportunity to check out the other flavors. I highly recommend this crepe joint. 

Also, the people working there were incredibly friendly."}
