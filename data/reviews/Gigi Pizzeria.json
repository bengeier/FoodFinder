{"text":"Was there Sun.Mar18th,
Very small place about stalls very narrow (not for big people to sit but the pizza very good the service was excellent!
Im a by passer from an hour away and will stop again on the way by or for take-out."}
{"text":"pizza is very good. ranks up there with miss Jean Talon or Woodland. as you walk in it looks but more importantly SMELLS like a REAL pizzeria. something which is lacking in the west island. however, I have two small issues. first, it's cash only. I mean...come on!
second, the booths are WAY TOO SMALL!! yes I could lose a few pounds but if you're over 6feet tall or a little round in the middle. ..no joke. ..beware!
other than that. ..keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"Very good pizza ...tried all the pizzas in west island and this one is up there with the best..The only thing they are a bit pricey ...but wtv its good to treat your self :). Try the deluxe all dressed onions and bacon yum yum And dont forget a cold Heineken"}
{"text":"Definitely the best pizza on the West Island. I agree with the others who say that it's overpriced, but compared to what else is available in the area, I am willing to pay extra to get pizza that doesn't taste like cardboard. The pizzas are a bit heavy (lots of cheese), but the crust is the best part -- so good!!"}
{"text":"Good pizza, but a little bit backwards since they don't  accept any kind of card at all, you have to use their in-store ATM  which charges a $2.50 fee."}
{"text":"And I live in Toronto, albeit I'm an ex-pat Mtl West Islander.  It's the best place for traditional Montreal-style pizza and the only restaurant in Montreal that is programed into my cell phone.

Yes, there is a Montreal-style pizza.  I get the All-Dressed pizza which is a continuous overlapped layer of pepperoni, layers or mushrooms and a good helping of green peppers per slice. All of this deliciousness is BELOW a thick layer of nicely browned cheese. The result is juicy, cheesy pizza goodness. The pizza is pricey but when you dig in you'll know why.

Service both take out and eat in is efficient. Atmosphere is typical of a small, indy pizzeria - you go for the pizza not for the atmosphere or decor"}
{"text":"Come on people. This is sooooo not a thin crust place. Let's have reasonable expectations shall we.

If you like thick-crust pizza it's pretty good. We had  1/2 Hawaiian /  1/2 deluxe (meat lover's). A 6-slice medium was plenty for three relatively hungry people. Enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"I shed a single tear when I think about the state of pizza in the West Island. I mean, it's like a desert. There's nothing good. The chains are terrible and everything else is just weak. Gigi's is the best you're going to find. It's pretty good, if a bit heavy.
It's overpriced, so you probably want to go eat there instead of ordering in. At least then the pizza is fresh out of the oven, and you're in the lovely Pointe Claire Village, so you can stroll around after you eat."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favourite pizza ever! With take out you will be amazed when you pick up the box at the weight of it. They do not skimp out on toppings and the thick crust done to perfection every time. Green olives are divine. Will always be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"This is the best thick-crust pizza you'll ever eat. Where all restaurants have now gone towards thin-crust pizzas (which are great, or even better than thick-crust), Gigi's has kept their tried-and-true thick-crust pizza the same as it always has been, and it's perfection. I've been eating Gigi's pizza for over 20 years and it hasn't changed a bit. 

They don't appear to offer delivery anymore so get your butt into your car and go pick it up. It's worth it. 

Dining inside the restaurant will bring you back in time, as it hasn't been updated, probably ever. The booths are minuscule and the ambiance takes away from the \"experience\" in my opinion, so I would opt for Take Out. 

Go for the All Dressed or add some Bacon to your favourite pizza. Mmmm."}
{"text":"Pizza is good, left me full after 2 slices. Very generous with toppings and I love the crust because it was on the thicker side. This place is great to take out a box of pizza for a night in. Nothing authentic or different but definitely carb satisfying! 
However, 40$ for an all dressed xl pizza? Hm... 
Environment is cute considering the look is to imitate a down to earth pizzeria of you want to keep it casual."}
{"text":"My comments will echo that of a fellow Yelper - I think your opinion of Gigi's will be largely informed by what you think of their sauce; if you like sweet, you may enjoy it (and potentially this place), but if you prefer savory (ie. garlic, herbs, classic Italian seasoning), forget it. 

For me, the notes of cinnamon/nutmeg/allspice (coupled with plain sugar...?) in the sauce was a complete turnoff, as was the carb-bomb of a crust that will sit in your stomach like a brick.  The toppings are fresh enough but in no way innovative or refined - this is very much nondescript/uninspired pizza that will fill you up if you're hungry but hardly wow you as being anything remotely out-of-the-ordinary (barring that polarizing sauce)."}
{"text":"This place has been on my bookmarked list for a while now and I finally got the chance today to cross it off. The restaurant is small and dated, with what must be the smallest bathroom I have ever seen, that being said, everything was very clean.

I tried the mushroom pizza, I should mention that they are very generous with their toppings, so when I asked for extra sauce on the pizza, I got more than I bargained for. The pizza crust is thick, so it holds up all those toppings very well. The sauce is slightly sweet and the thick crust still has a light and chewy consistency and made for a great pizza. Will definitely be back. 

This pizzeria is located in Pointe-Claire village so on a beautiful day like today, get it to go and eat on one of the picnic tables along the water, the staff was great and made sure to give us utensils and plates (sturdy ones not the flimsy paper plates) for our impromptu picnic."}
{"text":"Pizza ok mais le plus gros problème c'est qu'ils n'acceptent pas les cartes Interac... il y a un guichet automatique mais avec des frais élevés... pas sûr d'y retourner..."}
{"text":"Somewhere along the line they changed their cheese and it hasn't been the same since. Now it's just average pizza - if that"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've ever had.  When they stopped delivering i was really dissapointed.  I'll still go once and while for take out.  It's amazing"}
{"text":"Some places you just want to keep secret 
That's just wrong 

What can I say, been there about 6 times 
Pizzas, subs, poutine its all GREAT! 

It's a small  restaurant in the village some parking in the back 

Cash only"}
{"text":"Really good thick crust Montreal style pizza. We had the Super All Dressed..so the norm plus bacon and green olive. Really perfectly done bacon on this pizza..a feat in itself and rare in these parts.  

36$ for a large pizza. .steep but wth.  I could only eat two slices and no outside crust.  So many leftover..my boyfriend will spend his tomorrow very happy. 

No cards, cash only and no bank machine close by so bring money.

Also..no alcohol."}
{"text":"If you like an amazing piece of pie.....Pizza wow  so worthwhile.  Little place nothing fancy but my mouth waters every time Gigi is mentioned. ..Pointe Claire village."}
{"text":"I don't get the fuss about this place.  Pizza was average at best.  Badly made, toppings were so soggy you could not pick up the pizza.  Taste was OK, crust was thicker than I liked (but it still couldn't support soggy toppings).  Dining area was cool but too cramped to be enjoyable.  I won't be hurrying back here, big build up, big letdown,"}
{"text":"Are you f*cking kidding me?!?
$75 + tax for 2 large pepperoni & mushroom, and 1 small plain?!?
All exceptionally mediocre and only cash accepted?? 
you assholes should  be investigated for fraud."}
{"text":"Not my kind of pizza. I prefer authentic  Italian style with a thin crispy base although I do enjoy American style from time to time. The pizza here however is very stodgy, too heavy on the stomach. Toppings are under the cheese which I also don't favour. The place itself is quite small and cramped to the point of uncomfortable. Pricey enough. Service is basic.

Disappointing :("}
{"text":"Great pizza, though I concede, perhaps not to everyone's taste. The secret lies in their sauce-- they definitely use \"sweet\" spices to liven things up, like allspice, nutmeg, and cinnamon (I'm guessing). At times, depending on what you order, those spices can be a bit overpowering. For example, they use the same sauce in their pasta dishes, and both my husband and I weren't big fans.
We usually stick with the pizza, and our favourite is the all-dressed, where there are many other topping flavours to blend nicely with that spiced sauce. The soft, medium-thick crust is great, and toppings are always generous.
The pizza isn't cheap, but what you are paying for is quality and flavour. Now, I just wish Gigi's would deliver!"}
