{"text":"Customer service can vary but is generally good. When they first opened I found that they were clearing the products before the store closed which was frustrating and gave a sense of not wanting my business. But, haven't noticed that lately. Their in-house convenience products are amazing. The Quebec butter has changed my life - I can't eat anything else now."}
{"text":"Their steak&mushroom pies are the best in the world. Rest of the pies, meats and salads are good too. 'Nuf said."}
{"text":"I went to Cumbrae's for the first time and all I can say is MEATLOVERS HEAVEN!!!!! Enough said. I will not shop anywhere else for my meat. The owners are polite, helpful, and a pleasure to be around. I could hang out in this store for hours!! YUM!!!"}
{"text":"This place has become my go-to lunch spot in the area and I've been coming in weekly. As you might expect from a great butcher, their sandwiches are made with excellent ingredients and are incredibly tasty. Every single sandwich is good here. Usually I'd have one favorite dish at a place, but here, I literally just rotate through the menu.   Outside of sandwiches, they have great meats, the best selection of charcuterie meats in the city and a bit surprisingly, I think also the best selection of cheeses in the area. The staff is very pleasant as well. Basically a perfect butchershop."}
{"text":"I did it again. I went back, ordered the same sandwich as before and read this review over. What the fresh hell was I thinking by giving only 4 stars? The Philly steak sandwich made with dry aged strip loin is a goddamn gift from the gods. Like actually.   I'm not a racy person by nature but I tried to eat this anaconda style - deep throat/swallow it whole. I'm not even ashamed.   Next time I'm getting the famous chicken sandwich (and a steak sandwich) because my pal got one and I was jealous.   That's all. Happy Easter kids.   Eatcrest out."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of Cumbraes and dream about their steaks. Of course there is sticker shock that comes with the drool, but if you wanted aged beef, there is no better place to go. It's like shopping for a Ferrari, even though Wal Mart sells great steaks there is only one Cumbraes, and now there's one on Queen West, and that's even better."}
{"text":"If you're lookin for meat or are a meat lover look no further! This place has it in spades! As you enter this store you get a hardcore who of of all kinds of meat- this is my kinda place. What is great is not only can you purchase meat solo, you can grab a deeeeelicious quality sandwich for on the run.. Say no more!"}
{"text":"This location of Cumbrae's is gorgeous and well stocked with both prepared foods and butchered meats.   The pre-made chicken chilli and green curry are phenomenal as well as the pre-seasoned leg of lamb.   The meats are beautiful. Thick beef short ribs, plump chicken legs, perfectly marbled lamb chops, it goes on and on. The only thing I've bought from here that wasn't amazing were some flimsy Miami ribs.   The reason this is not a five star review is because the staff at this location aren't as on-point as at the other 2 locations. Service here tends to be slower with many customers huddled around the counter before someone asks to see if they have been helped.   I highly recommend this Cumbrae's, but don't come if you're in a hurry."}
{"text":"The steak lasagna was delicious although quite expensive at $10.99 a slice. I also purchased the quiche which was sub-par. Their meats look very fresh and I would return to try that next time. Probably will skip their prepared food section as it is very over priced."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious, high quality meats, not to mention how exciting it is to go shopping here because it is soo visually appealing!!  I always get my whole chicken and filet mignons here!  From their hot counter the chicken sandwich is to die for! The steak salad is delicious to.  From the cold prepared foods we always get the buttermilk fried chicken, and the chicken salad that I order with a bun on the side for $1.   I have also tried their take home chicken pot pie! Very filling!!!!"}
{"text":"Know that feeling when you fall in love, and want to shout it from the rooftops? Well, get the earplugs: I AM IN LOVE.... WITH A SANDWICH. That's right. The roast beef sandwich from Cumbraes is worth shouting about.  $9.99. Made fresh to order. Thick slices of marinated, medium rare beef, cheese, and piled high with coleslaw. I can't believe this sandwich hasn't been part of my life sooner.  I've been an occasional customer since this location opened a couple years ago, and it's worth going out of my way for. I don't like eating meat too often, but when I do, I'm okay with paying for quality. And it's a bonus that they source from local farms.  My current recommendation is the maple dijon pork chop.  Plus, if you're feeling lazy, their prepared meals decently priced and way better than anything you're going to get in the grocery store."}
{"text":"I'm almost on the side of butcher snob which is dumb to say but I've been to some very high end steak restaurants around the world because of my job but in any case. I've also tried many butchers and most don't cut it and complete wastes of time. Whole food, pusitaries, and a butcher in Mississauga called 'Dry Aged' are my general go tos depending on the cut I want that day. For dry aged beef cumbraes is by FAR the best I've been to as far as home bought beef. It's very curious but a lot of Butchers will say they age their beef 30, 40, 60 or sometimes 75 days. I simply do not believe them based on the taste when I buy them. I know what dry aged beef tastes like (it's not for everyone). Cumbraes claims to age their sirloins for 28 days but I would argue it tastes more like 45-60 days. The flavour is bar none the best of any butcher I've been to. It's not cheap here but generally on par with the above mentioned places. If you are in the area or willing to take a drive for a home cooked steak, this is the place for dry aged beef."}
{"text":"Always love them. Besides being one of the best butchers in the downtown core, the prepared food and smoked chicken is also really great."}
{"text":"Fantastic dry aged steaks.  You pay the going rate, no sales to be had here but the steaks (2 ribeyes and a striploin) were among the best I've ever grilled myself.  We'd make a special trip downtown Toronto for these."}
{"text":"Really really nice prepared foods and meats. I bought lime/ sriracha chicken breasts, turkey sausages and turkey burgers. They were all amazing and very interesting. High quality ingredients and great flavor combos. It is certainly pricey but the meat is excellent and the marinades are really unique. It's a bit of a splurge shop, I definitely couldn't do all my shopping here. They have some harder to find cuts of meat as well, and  a great frozen section."}
{"text":"If you are looking to get the best quality meats in Toronto, Cumbraes is hands-down the place to do it. They are the best butchers in town and there are several locations, but the queen west location is gorgeous.  Prices can be a bit more than other places but you get what you paid for. I'd say it is worth it."}
{"text":"I bought a number of items at the Bayview location which were punched in individually on the iPad \"cash register\". Unfortunately it is impossible to verify in the moment that the amounts punched in are accurate. When it came time to pay, the amount charged to my credit card was inaccurate and was more than the total shown on the register. A manager reimbursed me after I complained but absolutely no apology was given. This is basic customer service and managers and store employees should apologize appropriately to paying customers when they make clerical errors!!! I suspect many customers are unwittingly overpaying (perhaps underpaying as well) with a payment process that relies solely on the accuracy of the cashiers' fingers."}
{"text":"After passing by many times, we finally decided to come in and get some steak to barbecue. Staff seemed a little disorganized, but eventually we were able to get some assistance. Before ordering our steaks, we looked into the ageing fridge. I told the lady at the front counter that I'm not familiar with the ageing process, but was surprised to see that many cuts of meat were covered in large quantities of mould. She scolded me, informing me that was the wrong thing to say, and proceeded to assist us, using a condescending tone throughout the transaction. Two steaks, and $100 later, we were headed home to fire up the grill. To be honest, the steaks were nothing to write home about. For the price, it wasn't worth it at all - we've had better from a regular grocery store.   Rude staff + crazy prices = no repeat business from me"}
{"text":"This was my second time purchasing meat and cheese from Cumbrae's and I have to say that I am very disappointed. The prices are exorbitant, but the quality is just ok. I purchased 2 year old cheddar and could swear it tasted exactly the same as grocery store Cracker Barrel cheese. Do yourself a favour and skip this place for a more reasonably priced, less trendy butcher shop. Your wallet will be better for it, and more likely than not, so will your tastebuds."}
{"text":"Purchased a fair quantity of prepared foods to take home.  Just OK...and for $120...!!  Almost EVERYTHING was extremely underseasoned.  Beet and kale salad, roasted root vegetable salad, pork and truffle Mac and cheese, brined, cooked whole rotisserie chicken....no salt of ANY KIND..... or other herbs.  Had to add myself, which is kind of NOT the point!  Isn't using salt the FIRST thing you are taught in culinary school?????  Did really enjoy the braised short rib sandwich that I ordered in store.   It was excellent!"}
{"text":"Just ate the little personal chicken, corn and bacon pot pie. Wow. Just wow. Was delicious. The new York strip loin I got was also perfect.   Its not cheap. But when you are putting things in your body. Why cheap out?  Great ingredients. Awesome store."}
{"text":"I've placed an order for $100 worth of sandwiches first thing in the morning. The staff was very accommodating  and definitely tried her very best to fulfill the order within 1-1.5 hours.   Sandwiches are always phenomenal at cumbraes in all locations, reasonable pricing and high quality meat!"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, I've bookmarked this place for a speedy return. The sandwiches sound incredible.   In my two experiences here, I've bought some beautiful cuts of meat and some of their pre-made sauces. Everything is always tender and delicious. Yes, it's a tad pricy, but sometimes you have to elevate a bbq to a BBQ."}
