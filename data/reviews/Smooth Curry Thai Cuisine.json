{"text":"My husband and four year old daughter went to Smooth Curry on a Friday night August 28 2015. I had heard good reviews so we went to try it out. We ordered spring rolls and soup and two other main dishes. I asked the waitress to bring the appertizers before the main course as my daughter was hungry. She said she always does. We were seated at 7:00 pm and we're still waiting for our appertizers at 7:35pm. Finally we got our appertizers and shorty our main dish came minus one main dish! We were waiting but they never served us one of the dishes that we ordered but charged us for it on the bill!!!
I have never been in a restrauant were the service was so bad. Also it was busy but not full.
I do not recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Good quality Thai food in NW area. Their red curry is tasty and not over spicy. Love their Tom Yum Soup and papaya salad. Will visit again!  Try their dinner for Two, good value."}
{"text":"1st time here was amazing and the staff were more then accommodating with my health needs. The 2nd time I came here I was greeted by a very grumpy server. After explaining my order and indicating an allergy to oil she proceeded to explain to me in a very rude tone about \"how this is a stir-fry place and I've worked in thai restaurants for over 10 years. We can't accommodate you\". My jaw was on the floor as I could not believe how terribly she was speaking to me and denying my health needs which were not out of this world. All in all, I won't be returning and you shouldn't either. 

Like thai? Check out the vegan gluten free thai place in Cochrane :)"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed eating ere, had calamari nd chicken skewers fr starters and we both had Pad Khee Mow fr main, i had chicken in mine and boyfriend had beef! Thoroughly enjoyed it and will defo b back!"}
{"text":"Thus is the first review I've posted to yelp, but working within the hospitality industry myself, I felt I needed to speak both to the conflicting positive and negative of this restaurant.  

On the positive: The food is decent, not epically authentic,  but tasty, fulfilling, and as the only thai restaurant anywhere near the area, I'm satisfied to keep coming back. In addition, there is a wonderful server who works there. She works almost every night and is kind, attentive, and caring. 

The negatives: This restaurant is a superb example of a place that survives out of lack of competition and necessity in spite of its management; as supposed to as a positive reflection of  said management.  I have had three experiences with the manager. The first time, half way through taking my  phone order he said \"sorry too busy no order\" and hung up.  The second time I tried to order online he, without exaggeration, yelled at me, because he apparently couldn't hear me well enough, and hung up again. He third time I saw him, I was dining in the restaurant,  and watched him yell at someone for asking if he could settle the bill for them.

I am very conflicted every time I decide to dine there. Good food and a great server versus supporting a management team lead by someone who should be out of a job yesterday."}
{"text":"Walk in on Sunday noon for padthai , pad see ew and papaya desert. Only a few people eating in the restaurant, compared to Tea -pot across the street which is pack of customers. Overall the noodle taste just ok, price not even too pricey but too small portion."}
{"text":"Loved the food - a contender with Thai Bistro for best Thai food in Calgary. Portion size was more than enough (Pad Kee Moa and Larb gai). Great flavour, good service, good menu range. Restaurant got busier later in evening."}
{"text":"After telling a gf about the wonderful Thai food I had at White Elephant, she wanted me to try her fave Thai place in our neck of the woods.

We met at Smooth Curry shortly after 6, and there were a few tables occupied but not too busy. Seated in a booth by the window, we looked over the menu and settled on chicken pad thai and a red curry soup with rice and roti.

This restaurant is quite spacious, decorated with Thai memorabilia, clean and well lit with big windows.

Our food didn't take long, and the aroma when it was placed on the table reminded me how hungry I was - I couldn't wait to eat! Both dishes were great, fresh and super flavourful. 

Since this place is close to home, I wouldn't mind stopping by again if I was had a craving for some Thai food."}
{"text":"We ate here on Saturday early evening in July.  The place is clean, modern, and spacious with booths lined around the perimeter.  We ordered the mango salad, green curry chicken, Thai chicken and a double order of coconut rice.  I've had better Thai, but over all it was good, however I did enjoyed the mango salad, but my friend didn't.  The bill came to $45, which was decent.  There were two young Asian women that served us, they were both very attentive, solid service."}
{"text":"Smooth curry serves very good thai food. The quality of the food is incredibly consistent. It's a little on the pricey side considering how small the portions are however that is not that big of a deterrent for me. The staff was incredibly attentive even as there were only two individuals manning the front."}
{"text":"Ordered take out, everything was hot and fresh. All the food was really delicious. We had the chicken spring rolls, salad rolls, pad Thai, pineapple chicken curry and chicken satay. The heat wasn't too much for my kids."}
{"text":"Awesome experience at this Thai Resturant. They serve a great verity of Thai food on their buffet I did not want to go around and take photos of all the food but I did add some photos of deserts and fruits they even had fresh cut mangos. Not like some other Thai Resturant you get very skimpy choices I am sure most of you will agree. They have a soup that they cook right in front of you the drinks included plus exotic ice cream too. Coconut, mango & can't remember the other 2 flavours. From experience of they do lunch buffet well they also do great dinner. 
I would like to know other great Thai buffets if anyone knows great place please rely back."}
{"text":"I have ordered take out from here a number of times. The service has always been fast and friendly and the food very tasty. Good options with a terrific sticky rice for dessert.Note that they do charge $6 for delivery."}
{"text":"Got take-out only today but we will be back to take in the interior of the space, experience the service and try another dish or 2.
Stopped in to see if they had Singapore noodles - they did not but the staff recommended the pad thai - another fave of mine.
I asked for extra spicy and for once, this place got that right! It had a really nice chili kick to it! I got the shrimp pad thai and the 8 shrimp were butterflied - more places should do this. Delicious and perfectly cooked. I liked the texture of the noodles as well, they held up well until I got home. There was not too much egg which was great. I will get it without tofu next time but that is just my preference.
The only thing that I disliked was the portion size of the dish as a whole - smaller that most places in Calgary and for a steep price. ($14.95)
We also got an order of coconut rice. It was good."}
{"text":"Good food, but portions a little small for the price. 

Ordered the Red Curry with Beef, Cashew Chicken and some spring rolls.  Great flavour but portions were a little small. 

Ordered take out through skip the dishes."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located at the old Green Olive space.  The decor is very nice.  We came on Saturday lunch time when the parking lot was packed full with parked cars.  We were surprised to find only 3-4 tables of people.  The food itself tasted okay... in line with other Thai restaurants in town.  However the portion sizes are just too small for the price that we are paying.  Go to any other thai restaurant and your portion will be at least 30-50% more, depending on the restaurant.  IMO, this kills the whole experience.  Unless they drastically increase their portion size, I predict that this restaurant would not be in business for too long."}
{"text":"I've always been a huge Thai Boat fan, but hated the drive all the way to the NE, Smooth Curry Thai is just as good and some dishes are even better.  The decor is nice and the restaurant is always clean, to top it off the service is fantastic which is why I'm giving it 5 stars.  It's great to see some variety in the NW"}
{"text":"This the first time my friend and I found the restaurant after shopping at T&T and we decided to gratify our cravings for Tom Yum Soup. We were greeted by a waiter who was so nice and patient. We asked for vegetarian choices, and he said he could ask the kitchen to customize the dishes for us. So, we ordered a deep fried tofu with peanut sauce (not on menu), a salad spring roll, and two vegetarian tom yum soup noodle (customized). We enjoyed everything until the we saw the bottom of the bowl. They were delicious! Kop Kun Krup, Chefs and our server! Last but not least, don't forget to try out their delicious Mango sticky rice coconut gravy desert. Overall, two thumbs up! The portion was just right for us."}
{"text":"This is my FAV Thai place! Hands down this place is DELICIOUS. We live across the street and when we want to go on a date night it seems silly to just go across the street when we could go anywhere but this place is just to die for! I love their rice and their Yellow curry dish... I love the presentation of their food. The staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is very pleasant. Would and have recommened to lots of people!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! the satay, purple dumplings, pad thai, curries, veggie dishes  and fried ice-cream.. Food is all excellent as is service. The buffet is also extensive and beautifully prepared. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Went here over the weekend with some friends for the first time and I must say the food here is delicious with all the spices and flavours you would expect from Thai cuisine. However, the only downside of the restaurant is the size of the portions they serve. We started off with a appetizer of chicken skewers ($6 for 6) which were dipped in the peanut sauce, the chicken was seasoned a cook perfectly. However, I would have liked the peanut sauce to have a little more of a crunch to the sauce, was fairly smooth and lacking the peanuts. Next we began our feast with a assortment different dishes which were exceptional in flavour but again lacking in quantity for the price. We had ordered the chicken pineapple curry with spicy and wow were we in for a surprise. I can normally eat spicy food but the curry had quite a kick to it after a few bites, nonetheless great tasting curry especially paired with the coconut rice. We also ordered the grilled duck stir fry and I was a little disappointed with this dish, it had duck that tasted like it was straight from Tnt supermarket that was cobbled together with a few peppers. The portion of the duck was meager in comparison to the vegetables. Our last main course was the traditional pad Thai which was good but similar in taste with some of other Thai restaurants in Calgary. Lastly, we finished off with not one but 2 servings of mango sticky rice since we me and my friends love this dessert!! 

Overall, the food was above average when compared to some of the other Thai restaurants in Calgary and the service was exceptional. Didn't have to ask for a thing when it came to water or having our order taken. The only con to this restaurant is the portion sizes which are smaller."}
{"text":"Food is consistently great, service may be a little slow during the dinner rush but definitely worth the wait. Haven't had an un-tasty dish yet.

When it is in season, the mango dessert should not be missed."}
