{"text":"I believe the official business name is \"Uninspired Shawarma and Falafel House\". I felt their food relied more on the tahini and hot sauce than the flavor of the chicken/falafel. The thing this place has going for itself is the price, but if you consider the standard fare and serving size, you can definitely get better value/food from places a block away. Also, they've worked on streamlining the order/payment process because they have a dedicated cashier so it's never too long a wait. Helpful if you're just looking to zip in and out with some sustenance."}
{"text":"Flavorless falafel sandwich. Filled with lettuce. Hardly any sauce. A couple of pickles."}
{"text":"Beware of this place. The guy didn't even clean his hands after handling money and before preparing my food. Who knows what happens in the back? I wouldn't be surprised if they pick up food from the floor, if dropped."}
{"text":"I've been here many times. The beef shwarma is usually excellent, being juicy, well seasoned, and tender. The chicken is also quite good, properly seasoned and roasted on the spit. The plates and pitas are both well worth it, especially given the price and speed of service.  The felafels are poor, usually undercooked and not very tasty, so don't expect much here. The side salads are typically quite vinegary.  The staff are hit and miss. Some are friendly and generous. Others seem like they can't be bothered and are stingy.  Note that the beef shawrma runs out quickly, so you can't always get it.  Also, it's true that they're not the cleanest place I've seen, often rinsing hands rather than actually washing them. However, I haven't actually experienced any issues with it.  Try it for yourself."}
{"text":"I love me some Falafel, although I usually go for their Gyro Wraps. This place is right down the street from my work, and is far cheaper than any fast food joint in the area.  The wraps themselves are always fresh. Vegetables are up to my standard. Awesome staff as well (once you're a regular, they will go out of their way to really make your day). Only complaint is lack of gloves. I see staff constantly washing their hands, but when it gets busy I doubt it's happening on a regular basis. It's not that much money to invest in gloves, and I believe it's against health code not to. Otherwise, good food for a good price!"}
{"text":"my favorite lunch  falafel house lunch special.they have great lunch special  i got two kind of salad one kind of meat ,rice ,potato  and its only $5T"}
{"text":"I can't believe there are so many bad reviews - this place is amazing for one thing, and one thing only - their 2 for one falafel deal. Falafels are simple, delicious and very generous for their cheap price. My boyfriend and I always stop to get falafels with everything before heading to Varsity to catch a movie."}
{"text":"Good place for decent lunch at a decent price. I usually get the medium daily special (1 meat, 2 salads, rice, and potatoes). I usually replace the rice with an extra salad (trying to take it easy on the carbs ;). Slightly stingy with salad portions. Still enjoy the place though!"}
{"text":"I had the Philly Cheese Steak and it was absolutely amazing! So full of flavour and the beef was soft and juicy. The owner was also very nice! Highly recommended if you're looking for a good bite for a good price."}
{"text":"I used to work across the street and loved this place.  It was gone seriously downhill.  The last few times I've been there, the guy who made my shawarma was so stingy with the ingredients, it literally tasted like a lettuce garlic wrap.  And they were out of whole wheat wraps.  I'll stick to Ghazale."}
{"text":"Falafel House?  Are you kidding me?  It was downright awful.  I ordered two falafel pitas, lentil soup, and gingerale.  The falafels were not fresh.  After the cook put my falafel pitas together, he tried to press it in an electric grill...  When I sat down to eat them I knew it was not going to be good.  And I was right.  The falafels were cold and mushy.  And not only that it had that \"old\" aftertaste.  The lentil soup was bland.  I threw the second falafel sandwich out.  Yuck!!! And I was up all night because my heart and stomach burned all night. And I almost never get heartburn or stomach burn.YOU WOULD THINK A PLACE CALLED FALAFEL HOUSE WOULD MAKE YOU A FRESH FALAFEL!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went here to try the $5.99 lunch special. One thing to point out is the chicken shawarma meat is not an option for this special which is odd given that they are a middle eastern establishment. They only offered butter chicken or chili chicken as the protein option. They had a large selection of sides to choose from which was great such as beets, pesto pasta, different types of salads and etc.  The restaurant is a little run down and the chicken pieces were counted for each plate. There are probably better shawarma lunch specials around this area."}
{"text":"This is the cheapest falafel joint in Toronto (that I know of). They have 2 falafels for $5.99 deal which is a steal! They also have your typical shawarma offerings. The value is there and the quality is fine. It tasted better than a few other places I've tried. The biggest no-no for me in a falafel is when the patty is hard. I like it moist and soft. This place does a fine job of that.  There are tons of falafel places in the downtown area. If you want the best quality, don't come here. If you want good value, this is your place. My only complaint was that I had to wait a long time because there was just one guy working and he did everything.   I'm not a germaphobe so I absolutely don't mind the guy not using gloves. I don't know why people are making such a big deal out of it. Plenty of things are made without gloves."}
{"text":"Came to this place for lunch as my office is nearby. Ordered their daily special - the biryani chicken with two side salad for $6.99. The portion was huge and the salad selection was great. However I wasn't too blown away by the taste of the chicken - a bit dry. Overall, a cheap work lunch in this area. They accept debit/credit card payment which is a plus too."}
{"text":"This is the kind of hole in the wall that I've come to love to go to when I'm out of the country (I dunno if going to Canada from the US really counts though).    I had the falafel which was pretty standard.  Nothing particularly great/bad about it.    The place was clean, and the people were nice.   Pretty Cheap.  It was ~4."}
{"text":"Headliner: Good sit down Middle Eastern place, but doesn't hold a candle to other places in the areas for food quality.    # of Visits: 2 or 3 Most recent visit (before review): 12/23/2013 Order: Medium chicken shawarma plate  Pros: -Clean -Meat is decent quality -Price is cheap -They have a good amount of tables for eating in  Cons: -The cashiers are a bit surly - Compared to competitors around the area, portions are somewhat small  Verdict: If you are looking for a sit down shawarma place, this is decent, but if you are looking for the best deal, there are better options in the area."}
{"text":"I've went there twice in a month and I got two Shawarma's for 10 dollars and I was not satisfied with the amount of meat in the Shawarma's and the last time  I complained and the manager said he would make it up to but in my mind I said that I would never go back. Well and behold I went back again and nothing changed, when you get the two Shawarma's for ten  dollars they only give you half the meat and in both and rip off."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favourite places to dine downtown. The chicken squire tastes good, and so does the beef squire (kabob). The value is great, its $2.75 for each squire. Its perfect for someone on a low carb diet. They also take credit card as payment option which really convenient."}
{"text":"I really like their chicken shawermas. They ve good chicken curries, especially the one with mushrooms. The chilli chicken isn't that great, tastes like ketchup. Well priced for dt."}
{"text":"Came here a few times and it always satisfies my shawarma needs. It's really cheap compared to the other places around here and I always leave pretty satisfied. The shawarma isn't that big, but you can get 2 for less than $10, and they're pretty filling. The employee is pretty friendly and makes it pretty fast. Nice place for a quick cheap meal."}
{"text":"It's not the best shawarma/falafal place in town but it's pretty decent for your cheap lunch option. I agree with some of the other reviews that there are better options in the area but always good to judge for yourself.   What I like is that the Falafals are made to order and they fry them in front of you so you know your getting fresh falafals. Their salads are pretty good as well. I had the small falafal plate which came with 3 falafals a generous salad and hummas. The total price was just under $6.00. I didn't notice until I got back to work that they don't give pita with the order. it's the first time I've ordered falafal and didn't get pita. Not sure if they normally don't give it or they just forgot. Staff is fairly pleasant and allow substitution, which is always a plus for me. Would definitely come back to try something different next time."}
{"text":"I just wanted to write a review here because this is the only place I've found in Yonge corridor north of dundas that actually makes their falafels to order.  This small little step makes a night and day difference in the taste.  That being said, I didn't find the falafels to be in the same league as Paramount Fine Foods.    Staff were a little bit on the surly side, but not unfriendly.  The price is certainly right with a great deal on 2 falafel for under $6."}
{"text":"If you are ever on Yonge street feeling sort of depressed in another lousy weather day in Toronto, this place would suffice for a very mediocre shawarma and falafel as I've experienced better. The store is quite compact and shares the in and out customer service as any other mall food court would have.  Located near the intersection of Yonge and Bloor, you might be distracted by the Brass Rail strip club across the street.  To give you a heads up if you want to visit this place, there is a store banner above it resembling the Lebanese flag  (in case you Geographic flag ignoramuses do not know, it's the flag with the pine tree car  with red horizontal stripes below and above it)"}
{"text":"This is basically another \"kebab house\" -- offering, not necessarily meat on a skewer, but the sort of plate with meat or falafel, rice, and a variety of vegetables. (It's similar to what's offered at halal food carts in American cities, but you get a lot more and varied food.) Since one of the places I know further south on Yonge is already gone, and another is in danger of closing because of redevelopment, I was glad to find this. You get a lot of food for your money; it's not gourmet quality, but it's filling, and, with all the vegetables, reasonably healthful. (According to a survey some years back, however, it's also more caloric than you'd expect: pace yourself.)  The counterman was quite helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"You can't go to Falafel House and NOT try the falafel.  It's just insanity not to. I will say, it isn't the best in the city but it isn't the worst either. It does the job it needs to do which is fill a falafel fix. Staff is great and the location is key. Not too far off from Yonge and Bloor and falafels are filling."}
{"text":"I actually came here couple times for a quick lunch or just do the falafel to go.   I usually just buy their $3.99 for 6 falafel to go as snack. I personally don't eat rice so I ask them to give me a falafel salad which I get to choose several different types of salads.   It was good. It's not expensive. usually under $7 for a plate. They also deep fried the falafel right on the spot when I ordered it.  Eat a pita just up the street is fairly popular but I think you get more choices for the salads here. Except eat a pita's falafel is cheaper (they charge 3 falafel for $1, however the size of the falafel is smaller)  Otherwise it's a good alternative compare to McDonalds."}
{"text":"Chicken shawarma wrap is fantastic! Good value. Staff are friendly. The place is in need of some serious renos so get it to go if you can."}
{"text":"Best falafel in Toronto, hands down, but quality can be a bit inconsistent.  Sometimes the falafel balls have been there for a while, which is definitely not awesome, but when they are fresh, they are just right.  The real gem here is the \"Super Falafel\" which includes all the regular trimmings and roasted eggplant.  When you are super hungry, the Super Falafel really hits the spot.  I also highly recommend their Dolmas and tomato salad."}
{"text":"rude service, unfriendly  had to ask the guy to wash his hands and wear gloves  before prepping my falafel  the falafel was soggy and undercooked he refused to give me extra tabouli  saying it cost too much  dirty atmosphere"}
{"text":"One of the best spots for lunch. I've found their chicken to be on the dry side but the fish is great. Lunch specials come with rice, potatoes, and 2 salads. I love their wide selection of salads. You get a lot of food for $6.99. I always get their garlic & hot sauces."}
