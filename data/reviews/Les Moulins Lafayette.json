{"text":"Avis pour le café et croissant jambon-fromage: Service courtois, mais café americano et latte équivalent à celui du McDo et du Tim. Croissant jambon-fromage ok, sans plus."}

{"text":"Honestly, this place has the potential to be so much more, but really falls flat on atmosphere. The counter staff (well, the one that served us) are friendly and helpful, and that's where three stars come in. The treats are generally very good BUT it can be hit and miss - if you're there at the end of day like we were, you might end up with a less-than-fresh mini cake. My moka chocolat was perfection (sealed up in the outside by a thick layer of glaze) but my date's mini Opera was a bit heading towards the dry side.  Now, atmosphere: a few things aren't working - the first one being the dirty, unwiped, disheveled tables everywhere. Better for you to do a dessert grab-and-go.  Secondly, the hideous fluorescent lighting kills any potential ambiance. Add to that the loud hum of the wall of refrigerators that drown out the background music and well, it seems a bit like a morgue. Also, there isn't much for clientele, so it can be eerie. One last cake before you go into a drawer!  Seriously, though, I wouldn't expect anything more from this place than to get in early, pick up a cake, and make off to somewhere more enjoyable with it."}

{"text":"I had lunch in the past in the old port and it was pretty good. I had their pastries this weekend and wasn't really impressed considering the price they charge and comparing all the great French pastry shops Montreal has to offer.   Their Almond croissant is probably their best danish. As for their pastries they're really not that great and not the freshest. I had the Paris Brest, their chocolate macaron, Mille feuille and some raspberry praline pastry.   Last but not least, their lattes aren't that great either."}
{"text":"I guess the best way to describe this place is a bakery/cafe/cafeteria.  You can buy products to take away or stay for breakfast, lunch or just a coffee and sticky bun.  It was a mixed experience for us.  As a bakery, the bread was fresh and tasty.   We bought a baguette for dinner that evening and were not disappointed.   As a cafeteria, the service was friendly.  The decor is basic, with about a dozen or so tables.  We had stopped for lunch.  We had what they called their \"boite a lunch\".    I started with the roasted tomato soup and it was excellent.  My wife had the salad, but was not impressed by the dressing and thought it all looked a bit limp.  The next course was a quiche or a mille-feuilles.  I had their mushroom offering, my wife had roasted veggies.  They grill the pieces in a panini grill.  When we arrived at our table, it was obvious that the mille-feuilles had been sitting in the counter for more than a day.  Heating them up simply turned the pastry into a warm soggy envelope for the stuffing.  The dessert was a tiny piece of left over pumpkin pie from another day.  Now, the boite a lunch special costs $8.95, so I guess you get what you pay for.  The only thing that was good was the soup, which seemed to have been made the same day."}
