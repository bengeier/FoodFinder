{"text":"The views are spectacular! My husband and I stumbled across this restaurant walking into town from the Ferry. The food was wonderful and as a bonus it had gluten free options for me! The atmosphere is low key but great service!"}
{"text":"Best coffee and people watching in town...Service is very good and they let you linger as long as you like! Great way to start the morning. Also it's just across from the visitor center so it's a great place to make your game plan for the day."}
{"text":"Nice to sit outside and view the boats and people. I had a Mojito and my friend had a coffee, which we both enjoyed. It was served with potato chips, Olives and pretzels. Nice t"}
{"text":"Directly on the main port in Bellagio facing west. This is THE place to kick back, have an apertivo and watch the sun go down as the ferries putter past.  Drinks are cold and tasty. Food is mainly snacks and sandwiches, but instead just order another apertivo and watch the accompanying snacks come pouring in."}
{"text":"Great café, great people watching right off the ferry, great pastries, not too spendy, was a delight."}
{"text":"Bella solo la posizione, sul lungolago....servizio abbastanza scortese ed altezzoso...cornetto alla marmellata di pessima qualità così come il ginseng...negativo..."}
