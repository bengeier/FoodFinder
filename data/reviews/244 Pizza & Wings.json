{"text":"I would not advise anyone to eat wings/wedges or anything from this place no matter how hungry you are, how cheap it is, or how convenient it is. I am shocked as to how this place is still operating. The employees have horrible hygiene and the place is extremely dirty. They truly have horrible customer service (not really that big of a deal for me). But one worker used inappropriate language at this young lady who was with her little son and that is just unacceptable. Anyways, when I got my food and arrived home I discovered TWO WINGS/BONES that were HALF EATEN inside my wedges. My wings were gross, some were big like the size of my FIST! Seriously, I'm not even entirely sure if it is really chicken. It looked vomitrocious (if that's a word) and I did not eat anything nor will I ever go back. Worst experience ever!!!

I am still disgusted thinking about it but hey if you still decide to go you should at least thoroughly check your order."}
{"text":"This places wings are sooooo legit bruhs. 

Price. Size of wings. Basic flavours. All and seven thumbs up.  The area is ghetto as hell so huge your phone but this place is werth the robbery.  

Legit Legit Legit corner wing place..  As for the pizza..  It's cheap..  Not great but cheap

And if you ever need a side or wanna fill yer fat ass up like me. Order large wedges,  they give you a bucket of wedges for 5$ got dam 

As for wings it goes 20 wings for 10, 30 for 15"}
{"text":"Courteous service with staff who seemed pleased that I am a regular customer. I pick up a slice of pizza for under $3 and am given a quarter of an extra large. This gives me three actual slices of pizza and I am full by the time I finish my lunch. The pizza is not gourmet but has enough cheese and sauce on it and the crust is certainly good enough (although slightly thin). Wings are the main attraction here. This is a lower income neighbourhood but everybody who comes in to order is treated with respect. I cannot recommend that you drive out of your way to join they locals here. If you are in the area, this is likely the best place to eat and is the most popular spot in the community for a reason."}
{"text":"Everyone in this area comes here. If you look on theirs fridges, they probably have the number. They are best known for their juicy wings and fries. Pizza is well..pizza. Prices are cheap and practical. Not the cleanest but which place is? At least I see them making my fast food without them going into a shady back area to do god knows what. My advice? Bring exact cash. Life goes by faster here if you just take out (seating is weird) and eat it with some good buddies at home."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of 244 Pizza & Wings! I've been coming here maybe about once a month (or sometimes more) for my wings & wedges fix for the last few years and have yet to be disappointed! Their wings are big, saucy and oh so delicious. We usually get the suicide flavor with extra sauce so I can dip my wedges in it as well. Their honey garlic is also yummy. And if you're feeling adventurous you can even ask them to mix the suicide sauce with the honey and garlic for some spicy and sweet goodness. You can even ask for just the battered wings with sauce on the side if you don't like too much sauce. They're very accommodating! Lastly, the price is right for what you're getting. Best bang for your buck! 

The pizza on the other hand is not that great, but pretty good value for what you pay for it. I only come here for the wings and wedges so that's what my 5/5 star review is for as I've yet to find better wings anywhere else in (West) Toronto!

There's ample street parking on Weston Rd and also a green P lot right across the street."}
{"text":"My favourite pizza my least favourite service. They never pick up the phone,you'll have to try calling 2-5 times before they even pick up and today when they did pick up the guy asked for my order then hung up on me. I'm not going to keep giving them money, like- get better service holy smokes how hard is it? 


EDIT  my dumb self decided to give them another chance- called for pickup, waited 5 minutes for a member of their 4 person staff to address me, a white guy that had ordered after me came in and got his order immediately. Yeah f this place I would literally rather go anywhere else"}
{"text":"I wish I could have rated higher but allow me to explain.

This place does not have a lot of signage but it is there. When entering you see the whole kitchen behind the counter. The menus have options for single (pizza and wing) combos and double combos. While I was perusing the menu when someone came in behind me and when they told them that the wait for a pizza would be 20 minutes, I decided on some slices.

I ordered a slice or two and waited while it warmed up. In the meantime, I continued to peruse the menu and watched the chef have a major coughing fit. I could hear my bosses words ringing in my ears \"I always have to wonder when in line at a buffet, did the guy ahead of me wash his hands?\" In this instance, the answer was a definite no, but then I didn't really explore with him why he was coughing...I was just happy I ordered a slice instead of a fresh pizza.

The person who ordered before me returned after about 5 mintues and waited for their order as well. When it came time to take my stuff and head out, I was given the other customer's dipping sauces. I corrected that and passed it onto the rightful owner although I suddenly regretted not ordering any myself. It looked homemade.

I had a few issues with this place: they don't appear to own a cash register so everything is added up by hand, they still charge for plastic bags, and the cook uses his bare hands to cook but will put on a glove when collecting money from you.

All in all, I wouldn't return to this place unless I was in the area. However, the pizza itself was quite decent. although...I still wish I had ordered the dipping sauce."}
{"text":"great service, great price and good variety of sauces. 
pizza isnt too heavy and is very light, tastes almost like pizza pizza.
wings can be a tad small sometimes but still the best bang for buck there is."}
{"text":"I've ordered wings from here numerous times, but last night was probably the last time I order again from here. I'm not sure if it was an off day or what not but the wings were so tiny, meatless, and dry and seemed like they were double deep fried. The s&s sauce tasted off as well. And hour after eating them I felt sick to my stomach and woke up with the same feeling. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Was visiting a friend in the area. No, I was not wearing a bullet proof vest. The area is sloooowly improving. How can it not ? Brick buildings, nice detached homes in the side streets. Mount Dennis your time will come !
Great value for properly prepared wings, pizza is good enough. Fast service, low prices. Did take out. Will pop in again."}
