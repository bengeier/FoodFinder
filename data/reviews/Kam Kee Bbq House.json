{"text":"This is my favourite restaurant. The food is great and healthy. My friend and I were invited to see the food preparation area one day and everything is so clean and well arranged. I am a regular customer of Kamkee."}
{"text":"This is a great BBQ house, take out only but a hidden Gem, all staff come out a say hello here! This is a must place to get food!"}
{"text":"Passed by this place...used to be KFC looking long time ago... I have to five em 5 star. I went there around 4pm... I grabbed the last piece of cha siu.... Omg its so goooooood..
The woman who helped me was so cheerful  and so nice...you don't see a lot of Chinese elderly women with smiling face...I love it.
My bill was $5.40 she just round it down to $5. I'm very greatful for that. ..
I will go there again definitely. They do have a couple of tables...I dunno what else they serve...I don't understand Chinese writing...so I just stick with what I know.
Maybe next time I will go earlier...though the last little piece of cha siu I got was little fatty...it is still really yummy...
Must try if you love BBQ stuff... They got BBQ sausage, roasted pork amongst others ."}
