{"text":"A new Indian restaurant just opened up in Mississauga and the food was very good! Here's what we had...

Jalebi chaat... A tasty play on the classic that uses savoury, crispy-fried jalebi as the base for the chaat toppings. I love dishes that incorporate sweet, sour, crispy and soft. This dish is exactly that and tasted as good as it looked. I especially loved the sweetness from the pomegranate seeds! 

Eggplant Kathe Mitte... Stir-fried Japanese eggplant in a delicious tomato gravy. I didn't catch a lot of sour notes but that's okay! The dish was my favourite of the night, as the gravy was balanced, creamy, spicy with just the right level of sweetness. 

Lababdar Paneer... Cubes of paneer in a very mild, creamy tomato gravy. The dish was good, if you like mild flavours. The big chunks of paneer got eaten up way too quickly, leaving behind gravy!

Daal Makhani... nicely seasoned and rich lentils... I could taste the ghee! We enjoyed it with perfectly cooked basmati rice. 

Kulche stuffed with potato with a side of channa masala... the bread was soft, fresh, chock full of potato, very tasty and filling. The bread paired well with every dish we ordered. The channa masala was nice in small amounts as it was heavily spiced. 

Gulab Jamun cheesecake... Sounded so fun that we had to try it.... It was a square of cheesecake studded with a few Gulab Jamun balls. I didn't think it tasted like the Indian sweet. It tasted of mainly of vanilla, cream, was lightly sweet and had a gel-like texture. 

Overall, we really enjoyed the food and we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"At last I found a place where they have my favourite tangra chilli chicken. Its famous in Kolkata. They also have Kolkata style chowmien,simply yummy. I am now their permanent customer. We had a mutton dish too, that was yummy, sorry I cant remember the name. The papad box was awesome only one thing was missing with papad was bengali style dates chutney. I highly recommend the restaurant."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Try the jalebi chaat, red chilli chicken tikka, tandoori lamb chops, nimbu tawa fish."}
{"text":"Stop giving this creature money. He is a cancer on our society. The worst person you could ever hope to NOT meet. This business will fail and children and families will suffer. But not this piece of excrement. He will walk away to screw more people and make more suffering.  Go anywhere else."}
{"text":"In past few months, I have dined at Kolkata Club a number of times to be convinced enough to write this review. Consistent high-end service and quality of food. The ambience is always comfy and classy reminding me upscale old world charm of the club cuture of India.  
I dined for dinner on weeknights and weekends, also for lunch on one weekend, that too with different sets of friends and all by myself too. The front of the house is very welcoming.

I tried different dishes on the menu and the wine list is exquisite. Indeed, the best rising star restaurant in Mississauga. I would highly recommend Kolkata Club to all people who look for quality food and overall cherishable experience - Culture and Cuisine to savour at one luxurious restaurant."}
{"text":"Came for dinner based on a recommendation of a friend. Being a Tuesday night, it was fairly empty. The interior is quite nice and clean, with a bar and many tables. The staff are very friendly and attentive.
The menu has many unique dishes and has Indian as well as Chinese dishes. We started with the cauliflower that has a graham flour coating and is vegan. It was very tasty and rated a 5/5 by my entire fam. They also had the prawns which they said was average and rated it a 2 or 3/5.
I had the eggplant (vegan)which was very good....kind of tart but a nice crispy and chewy texture...5/5.
My son did not like his chicken at all ....1/5.
My other son loved his paneer kofta....4/5.
My mom did not like her fish....it was supposed to be spiced and Tava fried, but it was served on a sauce which made it soft and moist...mom wanted it dry....1/5.
The rice was great as was the chilli garlic naan. The butter naan, chilli mint paratha were ok but my son did not like the cheese naan.
Portions were decent but items were on the moderate to pricey side.
My boys ended with meethi roti which they enjoyed....4/5.
The teas were enjoyed by all...masala chai, mint tea. And lavender rooibos.
Apparently they have a tasting menu as well and a high tea on weekends.
They really seem to be trying some new things so I hope they do well."}
{"text":"We had a lamb and vegetable biriyani. Food was flavourful and not too hot and the taste of spices came through. 

The ambience though is average. Considering the restaurant opened recently, my chair was rickety and the table was not too stable - a case of cheaping out a bit on furniture. Lighting levels ( especially at the central tables where there are no overhead lights) was very low and to read the menu was quite a task. There is a fine line between sophisticated low lighting and just low lighting."}
{"text":"Newbie in the hood! This place just opened about a week ago. The ambience and the decor was on point. The restaurant has been carefully decorated to mimic the feel of Gym Khana Club in Delhi, Mumbai or Kolkata. They have tried to pay ode to the \"clubs\" of India in their own way! 
The service was attentive and timely. The menu has a ton of variety for vegetarians and those who prefer meats/seafood. 
We were a group 4 and we ordered 2 apps, 3 mains and a rice with a variety of naan. It was a ton of food! We got their Jalebi chaat and Veg momo's to start and both were delicious. For mains we had their Bengali Shrimp, their Chicken Saag and their Paneer Kofta. Both the shrimp and chicken were really yummy, but the kofta dish was underwhelming. It did not have enough sauce and was too dry. We let them know about the Paneer Kofta dish.. and they took our feedback quiet well. The Naans and the Truffle Pulao were all really good. For dessert we shared their Mango Roshogulla and their Parle G pudding, which is essentially a custard with biscuit bits on the bottom. So nostalgic! Both were good, but I prefer traditional Roshogulla's so the twist didn't really fascinate me. 
The prices are a bit on the higher side, so maybe a good spot for special occasions or date night. A couple can easily enjoy a dinner for ~$60-70"}
{"text":"The Nimbu \"Branzino\" fish is to die for. The food is so delicious. Jalebi chaat, cheese chicken tikka with mozzarella, Tibetan momos, British railway cutlet, Bengali prawn curry, khatte meethe eggplant and parle g pudding is must try"}
{"text":"A brand new hotspot where Amaya's old venture, Sindhi ran out of fuzz. Interiors are tastefully done adhering to fine dining standards.

We waited for a while before being seated and were promptly presented with menus and brief introduction by our host. Started off with appetizers which included:

Jalebi chaat: Traditional jalebis without sugar syrup,  garnished with potatoes and pomegranate seeds. Fresh and light. 

British Railway Cutlet: Minded lamb kebabs pan fried with strawberry chutney. Perfect texture and succulent bites.

Chicken Momos: A bit disappointing. Were slightly soggy, seemed undercooked unfortunately. But they were eventually taken off our table and finally didn't appear on the check. Gracias!

Moving on to the main course:

Nimbu Tawa Fish: Pan fried Branzino fish served over plum sauce. Delicious!

Amritsari Kulcha with Choley: Amazing! The perfect potato stuffed Kulcha and North Indian style chickpeas. In hindsight, I should have just started with this. 

And, finally for the dessert, we went for Parle G Custard Pudding. Something so normal as a custard pudding had a twist of old school nostalgia. The ubiquitous Parle G biscuit from each and every departmental store or Mom'n'Pop shop back in India. 

Our evening was a perfect combination of attentive service, gracious host and high quality food. Met the consulting partner who has some 'jazzy' plans to reinvent Indian food scene in Mississauga. Hope those pan out.

We'll be back as soon as we can!"}
{"text":"Splendid ambience, attentive service and the food is just fantastic. First time here and it won't be the last time. Great concept and execution. 
The lemon fish and the lamb was the best part. And this may soubd weird, but the rice is cooked to perfection. I haven't had rice this perfectly made in years."}
