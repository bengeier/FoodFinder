{"text":"I like this place.  I had the lemongrass chicken salad and it was super fresh and great tasting. The next visit, I tried the purple rice pudding and I really liked it. I liked it so much that I made my friend who lived nearby to get me take out when he was coming over.  I would definitely recommend this place if you want good food with good value. Also I great place for a quick meal (real food!) or just when you are craving something sweet.  Next time I go, I will try those herbal teas."}
{"text":"Randomly tried this new place. I was very surprised to find they have a range of desserts and meals. I tried the leek and potato soup which was awesome. And I also tried the vanilla bean cupcake which was also really great. All in all, this is a new neighbourhood place that I'll be coming back to regularity. The staff is great, it's very clean and the menu is good for any mood. It's also cozy to come by yourself because there's a bar/stool section. I don't normally like eating places alone but this was a quick bite and it was comfortable. It's a must try... I'll be going back!"}
{"text":"Blown away.  Loved the Device that helps coordinating service. HOWEVER I just noticed that the menu and the glasses still have the signage from a previous establishment that has shut down ?!  Ordered the Mochi which was amazing"}
{"text":"Came here because of the durian creme brulee and it did not disappoint! Really cute little cafe right off yonge/sheppard area with limited seating and only a couple parking spaces. I came here pretty early on a weekend so there was no other customers but it definitely gets busy in the evenings. The lady was super nice and gave us some recommendations since it was our first time here.   We ordered 3 desserts which were the durian creme brulee, fruity mango supreme, and the mixed seasonal fruits crepe. The durian creme brulee was amazing! Not too sweet and full of durian flavor. The other two desserts were also good. I really like how they don't make their desserts overly sweet. Presentation is very well done here. We also redeemed and got free strawberry banana smoothies thanks to checking in on Yelp! Super yummy with some coconut flavor and loved the little ice bits.   The lady was very kind to let us try their famous hand crafted icy mochi dessert on the house! We got the strawberry and mocha flavors. I had very high hopes for this since it's one of their well known desserts but was a little let down. The flavors were good especially the mocha one but I found that the mochi consistency was not chewy enough and a little bland.   Overall, I think this is a pretty nice dessert place, Prices are slightly higher but with the awesome customer service and super pretty presentation, I think it's worth it. They have lots of choices on their menu and also healthier options as well. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"We wanted to try some dessert further from our typical Markham and Scarborough area so headed out here.  Decor was nice with circular mirrors all over. Boy, did I have a pleasant view ;). Coming in groups of 4 seem perfect, but parking is limited so carpool!  In terms of taste and price, Jacqui L. described it well. The mochi balls were the star of the show (flavours on point). Customer service was great as well. Though, I may end up trying their closer location in Scarborough, Hung fook tong."}
{"text":"The deserts are very refreshing. I like how they are prepared with just the right amount of sweetness. Most of the sweet I tasted was from the fruits themselves. Large portions for reasonable price. The service was nice too. I would come back to try other items they have."}
{"text":"Incredible value for money!  Had the M6 combo (beef stew with vegetables and white rice) which comes with a mango pineapple smoothie for $9.50.  Everything is awesome and beats my expectations!   This cozy little cafe is extremely clean. Service is outstanding.  I don't know why it took me so long to come here. Will definitely return!  For those of you who don't already know, they're a branch of the Hung Fook Tong in Scarborough.  You'll find the same yummy items on the menu, ranging from rice dishes to snacks to desserts and beverages."}

{"text":"Cute new dessert shop in the plaza beside hero burger. We went in on a whim and was pleasantly surprised. Bright and clean inside with lots of freshly made desserts. The mochi ice-cream balls are even made to order! The staff was really nice and have use some free tarts to try. Really likes the mango cream tart. The coconut & strawberry jello pudding didn't taste like anything but the sago was great."}
{"text":"Friendly and excellent service (which seems to be rare these days). It's nice and cozy. Desserts and drinks are great! I had the durian smoothie and creme brulee. Very impressed."}
{"text":"Came here looking for a place to calm my pregnancy sugar craving and I'm so happy I found this place! I was waited to by a very welcoming waitress who made me feel very comfortable with the menu. After ordering I was brought another small dessert to try which was delicious! This place is very cozy, nicely decorated and with amazing desserts! Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Food quality - Just like every other average joe dessert places, got better options around!  Food options - great variety  Service - below average (attitude): ordered 2 traditional grass/turtle jelly, it came with approx. 10ml of syrup, asked for more and they said there are extra charges. Come on, the jellies are bitter! Not to mention the 10no syrup was watered down to begin with.  Environment - it's well lit and plenty of spaces. Doesn't seem dirty.  Service and quality are essential. I don't need to pay for bad attitude and extra charges on bad quality syrup . Not recommended."}
{"text":"Came here for dessert after dinner on a Friday. I ordered a steamed egg custard. It was ok. Other than traditional Chinese desserts, I think they have cakes too and also hot foods. Seating here is very limited. 2 tables and a bar table, can probaby fit 10 people max."}
{"text":"After chomping down on a huge dinner nearby, we ended up here for some dessert. Feeling fuller than [insert some obscenities here], I settled with just a tall, cold glass of honey lemon tea, whilst my companions decided on more substantial offerings.  As it was fairly late at night, the total wait time was short and soon I was paired with a large mason jar. Thin slices of lemon, lime, and orange trapped beneath cubes of ice, condensation running down the side, this cold refreshing beverage just begged to be drunk. The sweet taste of honey flowed from straw to tongue, balanced out by tangy citrus notes. The variety of slices (albeit limited in overall quantity) provided a welcome interlude from just gulping down a jar of liquid, and I left oddly satisfied having ordered just a simple drink.  Perhaps next time I won't overindulge in dinner beforehand."}
{"text":"Should have came here earlier! Amazing desserts. It is part of the Hung Fook Tong chain. Definitely get the mochi and mango supreme. Service was great. Will come back!"}
{"text":"This is for the Silver Star Blvd Location not the one located near Yonge and Sheppard  Came here looking for something sweet after having a meal at New Northern Dumplings a couple doors down.  Can't comment towards their hot dish offerings since we didn't order any..but for a \"cafe\" my feel that it should be more towards desserts/coffee/tea imo.  Hot dish entrees seem out of place.  We ordered the D6 \"Purple Sticky Rice Sweet Congee w/D. Fresh Mango for $7.00 & D10 Mango Tango.  We were really happy on the Mango Tango (wife and I enjoy most desserts with mango) order, however we sorta had mixed feelings on the D6 w/fresh mango.  My wife felt like that it might have been better if served hot instead of cold.  Also the D6 felt like a heavy dessert, considering we just had a semi-heavy carb loaded meal at New Northern Dumpling.  Next time might try the TofuFa.  Interested in the hand crafted mochi but too pricey for our budget (N23) @ $13.00/12 pieces.  The prices do seem to be a bit on the high side, especially considering the portion size.  In the product shot D10 looked like it was served in a much larger glass, yet when it arrived to our table the glass (in the picture I snapped) looked smaller.  Kinda new to the HK desserts mind you.  Anything with Sago we are willing to give a chance, along with anything with Tofu Pudding (Taho in Tagalog)  Their main entree combos : the product shots almost appear to look like clay pot rice dishes.  Also, the prices on their main entrees seem steep, might have to order one time to measure portion size of the dish to cost.  Curious to try : M1 - M5 (skip M3) some time in the future perhaps.  Likely to be back for a return visit for the D10 Mango Tango, along to try other desserts offerings.  Venue is a cozy and a place that people could hangout.  Debit & Cash accepted, not sure on Credit Cards"}
{"text":"I had walnut soup, it tastes authentic. Not that sweet but made me satisfied. Highly recommended if you are craving for ??"}
{"text":"Best Hong Kong dessert place in town.  Very authentic and oh so good.  A great selection. Fantastic high quality ingredients."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for weekday lunch. The place is in a small strip plaza and quite cozy on the inside. When we came here, there was one employee doing the cash register and also working in the kitchen. But it was super quiet. So I'm not too surprised.   My friend ordered from their lunch menu (Short ribs and rice) which came with a mango smoothie. I ordered the Mango Tapioca Dessert and, Curry Fishballs. I would say that I preferred my friends order. It's actually a good deal considering that you get a decent sized smoothie (which is pretty good on its own too) for $10. However, when I asked me friend, she said it's alright. Nothing special. My tapioca dessert was also alright as well, but I was quite disappointed with the fishballs. Once you have enough curry fishballs in your lifetime, you become a bit more picky about what you expect from this food.  Because we came here on a weekday afternoon - I feel like service was good because we were practically the only ones there. I can't say much for the other times. Would I come back again? Maybe...but it wouldn't be a priority. I'd probably want to try their other desserts like the waffles ."}
{"text":"My experience here has been subpar at best. The food is overpriced for the given portion sizing. For example my friend ordered a durian sago that cost 9$ , there was barely any durian, it was half a piece of durian, and the bowl is small for 9$.  I ordered mango pancakes, they gave two pieces. It was fairly alright in my opinion for something to try once (I like mango and whip cream) but I wouldn't make it a frequent thing since it cost $8.50. It contained one scoop of mango ice-cream, a lot of whip cream and few pieces of mango.  The environment was very quiet, I think only three tables were filled and the seats were torn and covered in duct tape, during my stay.  Overall, I would not return, it was really not worth my time and money. I don't know why this place is still praised as good when you can visibly see that it's bad."}
{"text":"A lil gem in the crowded Yonge and Sheppard. For those who love Asian culture and tradition in dessert this is surely a spot to go.   Mind you, the place isn't very big and the chances that you'll find it packed are quite high but... Trust me, it's worth it.   Had a durian smoothie and the durian creme brullée and they were ridiculously good!  The service is just wonderful. Tiger was super in assisting us. She went above and beyond to make sure we were all happy and satisfied.   Certainly a place I want to come back for more."}
{"text":"It is located in the corner unit of a Scarborough plaza on Milliken Blvd.   Cleanliness 5/5  Service 5/5 Food 3/5  As I walked in, a shop appears bright and clean. I was greeted immediately by a staff. I was looking at the menu, it has quite a lot of choices including mainly Chinese dessert and selected European desserts small cupcakes .  Please do not expect cheesecakes or pastry here. I came here for their soups and herbal tea.  Chinese herbal tea helps to relieve heat stress or calming and balancing the bodily homeostasis.  This is one of the self healing choices to taste traditional herbal tea if you would believe Chinese natural herbal science.  Price 3/5 moderately priced for food and desserts. I would be back to try other things.  The small soup I got was $8.5 and the herbal tea I got was called 24 herbal tea 2L at $20 plus tax. I enjoyed the intense herbal tea quality however the price is not cheap.  A cup of herbal tea costs $4.75~  Pls remember ask for their special items they have some selected items at better deals.    Great service and one score lost because I think they can reorganize and tidy up the decor or furniture inside the store"}
{"text":"Definitely recommend for everyone who loves dessert and tea! Love their stewed milk egg custard which not many place have. They are famous with their sago with many flavours! Homemade grass jelly, almond, coconut, cheesecake, cupcakes, and many more to choose from."}
{"text":"Great Service, good quality food and very reasonable price. I went over just to get dessert; however I saw plenty of people ordering food that smelt delicious. The highlight of my night was the mango pineapple smoothie. Rich, Creamy. Well done. Very small place that I would most likely re-visit when the weather gets a little bit warmer."}
{"text":"Excellent place for dessert at any time of the day!  Definitely geared toward the Asian palate. Not too sweet but packed with flavour.  The servings are meant for one. If you try to share, you will find there's not enough to go around and end up ordering more.  Average prices range from approximately  $4-$13 depending on selection. They even have bird's nest dessert with a price tag of $30!!!  If sweets are not your thing, they have savoury foods as well. Curry fish balls, rice dishes, you name it.  Post a pic on IG, or like them on FB and get a free cupcake."}
{"text":"This place was a nice place to chill out after a long date. Went there with my date after dinner, it is a bit out of the way if you are walking around Willowdale's usual water hole. The café has the usual charming Asian café vibe. They have an array of different desserts stretching from the typical Asian desserts to the European cupcakes and cakes. I enjoyed the coziness and adorable feel of the café, but desserts themselves is a bit forgettable. It was very run of the mill-standard in quality and prices, nothing particularly terrible or exceedingly awesome. I do however love the energy of the owner as she was very dedicated in promoting her goodies. The most memorable and wow factor was the butter icing to the cupcake. It is heavy but was not overly sweet, the texture was smooth and beautifully complimented the slightly sweet and drier cupcake. I enjoyed the icing very much, if you can't tell. I did not however enjoyed the sago dumplings in coconut soup, they were very sweet and wasn't all that exceptional. The overall experience was passable, I'd come back if we are in the area but isn't a place I would go out of my way for."}
{"text":"My friends and I walked in here craving chinese dessert after dinner one night. I've been to other Chinese dessert places in Markham that better that's for sure.  It was a weekday night and when we walked in there was only one other table sitting there so it was not a problem getting a seat. The interior itself is a typical cafe style, with some nice decor closer to the cash.  We were seated in a corner and the layout of the table was odd for five people. Four of my friends sat in the L shaped booth and there was chair stuck in the middle where I sat LOL.Moving on.  The waitress brought a pitcher of water to us and 6 cups. Two cups were stuck together and no one could remove them I guess that's why she brought 6? I noticed the other table had water that had mint and orange infused into it. The mint and orange could be seen in the picture, my group assumed they ran out. But more people came into the restaurant and they were all given mint water. :\  We ordered out desserts. I order the coconut cream with sago and red bean. (5.50$) It had some coconut shavings in there which is nice but overall it was average at best. Not special. I definitely would not drive out of my way to this place.  I will give them that the pictures featured in the menu do look like the dessert they serve. Other places have misleading pictures."}
{"text":"I was honestly disappointed with this place after seeing the glowing reviews. When I went that evening, we were the only customers. I ordered the mango rolls, a fruit crepe and fish balls and the fish balls were my favorite thing. I had to send the mango rolls back because they were so unfresh. The mochi part of it wasn't chewy, it looked like it was breaking apart from being too old or something. As for the crepe, it was nothing special, the fruits weren't very fresh but you can't really screw up the crepe part. The only highlight of the experience was that the staff members were very nice and when we first came in the girl greeted us and told us all about their specials.   In a nutshell: poor quality food, but good service"}
{"text":"I came here a few times but yesterday was probably the last. I ordered the seasonal fruits waffle but the waffle tasted extremely undercooked. It was too soft and had a \"defrost\" taste. We also shared the mango roll but it was just coated with shredded coconut with a giant sour mango. The selection of the menu is great but everything I've tried was not good enough for me to order again unfortunately."}
{"text":"Money well spent! My boyfriend and I got the Mochi Supreme, Homemade Apple Pie with Icecream and the Green Tea Creme Brule. The mochi supreme came with 4 different flavours and each came with 3, a total of 12 for $13, the icecream inside was smooth and creamy. The homemade apple pie was not too sweet since the crust balanced out the apple sauce, this costed $7. The Green Tea Creme Brule was my favourite out of the three, the greentea flavour was not overwhelming but you can still taste it, it was very creamy as well and only $5.80. The service was amazing, she knew that it was our first time so she let us know about their specialties and what each dessert contained in case of allergies. Definitely one of the best dessert cafe I have been to."}
{"text":"Just had a banana and strawberry smoothie, mixed Sango dumpling, creme brûlée. Can taste the strawberry and banana in the smoothie. Very fruity in the best possible way. Sango dumpling was unique. Creme brûlée was great. The service was what beat everything. Tiger (the waitress) was extremely helpful. She stayed and made sure we knew what we were ordering. Even brought out samples of other desserts she thought we might enjoy, and as expected, was amazing. Defiantly going to be my new dessert place in the area."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best Asian dessert places I've been to in awhile. They have a wide variety of things to choose from including dinner items and dessert items, where most of them are actually home made! Very cool. I came after dinner so I was just looking for something nice and sweet. After going through Yelp for a bit trying to find a place to eat dessert, I came across this \"hidden gem\" :) It's a small restaurant, but the service was great and the food was superb. I had the Mango Supreme Sago and it was delicious! Filled with various fruits and mango flavour, it was the perfect amount to satisfy my dessert cravings. Also had the Apple pie which was really enjoyable as well. Nothing bad to say about this place and I definitely intend to come back soon to try more of their stuff!"}
{"text":"When you enter the store it has a very modern feel to it but the tables are a bit uncomfortable because of the bars that go across the bottom and the top.  I redeemed my check in offer of a free banana and strawberry smoothie, although I didn't try it myself I'm told it was very very good.  I ordered the mochi and was told it was freshly made.  When you bite into it it does taste very soft and fresh but the part that kind of ruined it for me was the middle as another yelper pointed out the centres tasted like freezer burnt ice cream.  The flavours were wonderful and on par with the descriptions so overall worth a try.  Overall, definitely worth a try but it's a bit on the pricey side for the amount of dessert you get"}
{"text":"The hot dessert that we ordered was not hot at all.  We had to ask for reheat. I don't think we will go back anymore!"}
{"text":"Went to this place for some Chinese dessert. However, it did not came out as good as expected. I ordered the sesame delight, the mixed sago dumplings and the curry fish balls. The sesame delight was way to watery in texture, the dumplings were too hard and the curry fish balls tasted like 2 weeks old. It came up to be just before $20 which is a good price for dessert but will not consider coming back unless the quality of the food gets better."}
{"text":"We came as a party of 14. They were accommodating, but in the process of it all, they accidentally forgot someone's order.   I ordered the bolognese with cheese on rice noodle roll because I'm adventurous like that. I had high hopes for it. Had it been executed properly, it would have been fantastic. However, it fell a tad short of my expectations. There was cheese, but not enough of it. There also wasn't enough bolognese sauce and what there was was on the watery side. I could do much better at home and it'd have been cheaper, as this was somewhere around the $6-$7 range.  I also ordered 12 pieces of their assorted mochi. I believe it came in taro, mocha, strawberry, and mango. I had the mocha one. It was tasty, but the custard inside was watery. It did an awkward squirt thing in my mouth. I've also had better textured mochis.  I liked that they put mint, citrus slices, and sliced grapes in their water. It looks fancy. However, only the citrus was evident.  Some friends of mine got the durian crepe. It definitely smelled of durian. I heard the ice cream was durian as well. Perhaps next time. It was my friend's first time having durian and she loved it.  Another friend of mine got the BBQ pork rice noodle roll, if I recall correctly, and the portion looked pretty good for price.  All in all, this is an alright place to have a bite to eat or to grab some dessert/drinks. It isn't fantastic, but it'll do."}
{"text":"What a great place - I wish I could've tried more of their stuff during the visit.  A solid 3.5 Star from me.  I will need to try a second time to really get a good feel.  I went with a friend for a quick chat.  We got the sago/mango and lemonade.  The sago dessert was great, the lemonade however was not really a lemonade, rather water with fruit in it.  Nevertheless, it's recommended to try.  Food: 3/5, The lemonade had bunch of fruit and a lot of ice so you could technically gulp it in 2-3 seconds.  The presentation however was nice but perhaps they can look into making it more of a drink.  I'd like to try something else though since they had a lot of selection.  Service: 3/5, The waitress was super nice when she greeted us and recommended options.  Perhaps because there were only 2 people working at the time, it was hard to get their attention for additional service.  Ambiance: 3/5, it's a little place with quiet music but good seating.  Their decor is a bit eclectic but I enjoyed it.  It's a good place to chat with friends and hang out.  Price: 3/5, very reasonable but some may say it's pricey compared to other Asian dessert joints in the area (tea168 or finch area) at around $7-10 per person."}
{"text":"Great location and price! It's right at Yonge and sheppard. Desserts taste good and they have a lot of traditional Chinese desserts. Will definitely come by again... Only thing is I think they forgot to turn on the air conditioner and it was pretty hot in there. Other than that it's perfect :)."}
{"text":"Okay, I am officially confused. There's two Sweet Pea Dessert Cafe entries on yelp at the SAME silver star Boulevard location, but they're obviously both different (interior wise at least) and if you do go to silver star Boulevard, you're going to come across this place as opposed to the other place. But it probably shouldn't matter as they're both the same and have the same menu..  Anyways this is the one with a more traditional and plainer looking interior. I do really like their menu, it has some Western and some more traditional chinese desserts, so there's bound to be something for everyone.   I had their mochi and they were decent. They were nice and chewy, and the filling inside was cold. I also had their house special drink the other time which I really enjoyed. It had everything in there with the red bean, jelly, ice cream, and tapioca.  Prices are decent. I appreciate the mint/lemon water jug. It can definitely be a quiet and relaxing place but sometimes it can also get really busy. It's a nice simple place to enjoy some desserts."}
{"text":"Cute little cafe newly opened in the neighborhood...the desserts I tried were delicious and beautifully presented. The staff was friendly and helpful. The only complaint is the high chairs are not overly comfortable for extended sitting."}
{"text":"Found out about this place from my dad who saw a commercial for it on chinese TV. Took my girl friends there to try it out and was pleasantly surprised.   The cafe is situated across the street from the new Hullmark Centre at Yonge and Shepherd and is quite hidden amongst the construction zones there, but we found it and made out way into the brightly lit cafe. Decor was clean and simple, and there were display cases showing off all their baked goods.   We tried their made to order mochi assortments, Mango Supreme sago and a hot soup sago dumpling. All of it was really good, and tasted super authentic and reminded me of the many dessert houses in Hong Kong.   Will return. Really want to try their steamed milk and other speciality Asian style desserts."}
{"text":"Nice service, good food.  I liked their sweet black rice deserts in particular which you can get either hot or cold (seriously, get the hot black rice with fresh mango).  The mochi is very delicious as well each with a unique flavour, an ice-cream like custard filling and a perfect outside."}
{"text":"this place is a hidden gem. It took us a while to find the dessert place. However, it's located right beside the food court. It's like 4 stores right from Deer Garden and 4 stores left from Chako. It doesn't look super fancy inside, but the amount of detail and thought that went into my homemade apple pie was really good!! It was priced well too -$7."}
{"text":"Good place for Asian desserts. If you're looking for Western desserts like crepes and waffles, you're better off heading to any of the other places north of here on Yonge. If you're looking for the classic Chinese desserts like sago, sweet soup balls, or even the herbal jelly stuff, this is the place for you. Sugar Marmalade, just up the street, offers some similar options with more comfortable seating, but in terms of dessert quality, this place wins in both quality and variety.  There are only 3 tables each seating 4, and a number of bar counters around the restaurant. Not good for groups. Service is nonetheless friendly and accommodating. Only minus is that the place is a touch on the pricier side for its dessert."}
{"text":"My Order: Short Ribs w/ Black Bean Sauce (yummy, get it!)   Pros + Service: Quick and friendly. I like the concept of having a buzzer.  + Parking: free parking in this area is a little unheard of. I must admit that this was the main reason why I chose this cafe.  + Dessert: the selection is pretty big. My friend has a sweet tooth and her eyes gleamed when she opened the menu, haha.  Cons - W/R: only one per gender - Entree selection: limited. There are only 9 entrees available. I was hoping to get noodles soup but that wasn't an option. There is one dish that caters to more-western audiences. My dish was pretty delicious though.   The lunch menu is pretty reasonable. You get a $5 drink (I got the mango smoothie which was nommy) as part of your combo. Would I recommend the place? Absolutely- especially if you're big on desserts."}
{"text":"Amazing hand crafted ice cream mochi. The lady was so nice and allowed us to quickly buy desserts after closing. Service was amazing, food was amazing and the place was extremely cute. I would recommend to get the icey mochi. She was also a great joy to talk to and helped us choose the best desserts in the store. AMAZING."}
{"text":"Service is awesome!! They are passionate about what they do here and are very open to listening to their customers feedback. Wide assortment of Western and Chinese desserts. They even serve cooked savoury items but we only tried dessert. We ordered the mochi balls, durian creme brulee, herbal jelly, sesame paste and mango sago with assorted fruits. I loved the consitency of the creme brule but would forgo the durian next time. The sesame paste was freshly made and not very sweet. Overall this place is decent, don't let the dingy plaza fool you as it's modern and cozy inside."}
{"text":"The store is quiet small, the air isn't enough for me. The dessert is not bad. The drink is especially for me. It's hard to find for parking. Taking TTC drop by sheppard & Yonge. Close to a gas station."}
{"text":"Nice place with free parking and many delicious desserts... I suggest mochis however I did not like the taste of their Dorian dessert ;) overall good place to go occasionally :)"}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I wanted to grab some dessert after dinner and decided to come here. We were quite shocked when we saw the menu because it's part of Hung Fook Tong! I was really expecting more western than Asian dessert.  I got the mango roll for $5. The mango were not in season so most of them were hard. I should've known better and gone for something else but I also feel like the waitress should've recommended something else. I can imagine it tasting good if the mango were ripe and sweet. Unfortunately, that was not the case for me.  I would probably not come back to this location just because I have one so close to my home."}
{"text":"This dessert place is so good. Every year when I come to Toronto, I make sure to stop by. Every year I forget what I had the previous and so I am always trying new desserts here. This year instead of having ice cream at Swiss Chalet, I made sure that this would be my first stop for dessert this summer."}
{"text":"Got the mixed fruit cheesecake  The whip cream had a bitter aftertaste to it  The cheesecake had a weird cheesecake taste to it  Instead of a fork, they gave me a spoon  Also took too long for the dessert to arrive   Would not come here again"}
{"text":"I've had the curry chicken and beef stew here, both delicious. I've also tried all the mochi (mango and lychee were my favorites).  The owner also was experimenting and gave everyone goji berry sweet potato lattes w/caramel drizzle, delicious!"}
{"text":"So expensive!!! We got curry fish balls and it was watered down and no taste for $5.50. Also, the popcorn was v hard and it cost $7.59 for like 5 tiny pieces! The durian cake was alright but the sauce was melted by the time it arrived and it was not even that great tasting. Service was decent but food and price was definitely not great! Haha"}
{"text":"First time here.  Sadly, not too impressed! Only one table occupied upon arrival.  Service was slow & dessert were just ordinary & overpriced!  Old menu ( from previous shop?!) differs from shop name.  Would I come back for seconds?!  Most likely not!"}
{"text":"Just happened to be in Markham, so we started yelping to see what was new in the area.  We saw some reviews about Sweet Peas (and I do agree that the two Silverstar locations made it confusing when it's exactly the same address with different interiors).  We ordered the 12 assorted mochi for $13.  I was hoping to get mango and lychee but we got none.  But instead we got 4 flavours and 3 of each: black sesame, taro, mocha and honeydew.  They were smaller than we thought and only the Taro tasted like Taro.  The honeydew tasted artificial and black sesame didn't taste like black sesame.  Some said the mocha tasted like coffee, but I thought it tasted like chinese milk tea.   We didn't enjoy it at all, but we'll probably come back to try other desserts.  I wouldn't recommend ordering the mochi because the ones at T&T is almost double the size with real ingredients."}
{"text":"A nice little place for dessert. I used the yelp promo for my banana smoothie and ordered the sago dumplings. The dumplings were delicious, each one filled with different tastes and textures. The warm dessert was a nice contrast to my cold smoothie. It was nice and quiet midday on a Sunday. The girl working there was super friendly, with great recommendations. I would definitely come back. The only issue was with the parking, having been a little difficult to access as it is only accessible when driving north on Yonge. And though it did not affect my experience personally, there were few parking spots."}
{"text":"Even though they are supposed to close at midnight ... I walked in at 1225p and they are still very nice to serve me! I feel bad :( I really didn't know they close at 12am.  I ordered two papaya paradise and it's super delish! This place is always fresh with lots of traffic so I'm sure I won't get a stomachache after having their dessert!   Highlight of the visit: serving me with happiness after closing time!  Food (Taste): 5/5 Food (Presentation): N/A - got take out Kitchen (Delivery Speed): 5/5 Service: 5/5 Ambiance: 4/5 - bright but thought they would play some HK tunes, instead I hear Neyo :) All RnB here Fun Factor: N/A - not a soul here right now lol"}
{"text":"Mochi was the best item here. Taro Sago was a little bland. The fruity supreme was overpriced for what it was and was also bland. I would come here again if it was closeby but just for mochi."}
{"text":"With the rebranding of  Hung Fook Tong into Sweet Pea Dessert Cafe, I was hoping that would be new items on the menu just like their North York Location. But sadly, it is still the same old, same old... Not even a revamp of the aged interior deco.  Steamed Milk with Ginger ($6.50) and Assorted Mochi ($7) were both A-OK. I always enjoy their mochi!  Will I be back? Maybe as there are not too many choices for traditional Chinese dessert.  Accepts Visa, MC and Debit."}
{"text":"Desert was mediocre. I found that fruits were not fresh and I question some of the combinations of deserts they put together. Might be for other people, unfortunately, this place wasn't for me."}
{"text":"Had the berry crepe with mangoe sorbet, it was to die for, the crepe was light and thin. Also had the green tea cupcake, honestly one of the best cupcakes I have ever had, super moist and delicious. The owner was so nice, she even sampled us the chocolate and banana mini cupcakes, which were great. We also got a berry custard  which was light and fluffy. Overall, highly recommended."}
{"text":"I was rather surprised, upon arrival, to discover that this is a Hung Fook Tong location. The english name was certainly deceiving...   My biggest issue was with the mango roll that my friend ordered. Before ordering, I asked the waitress whether the mango roll would be any good since it's not exactly mango season. She informed us that even though mangos are not in season, the mangos they use are sweet so we should try it. However, we were all disappointed with the mango- it was extremely fibrous and not flavourful at all. I only wish she recommended us to try something else instead.  Everything else we ordered were fine, but nothing outstanding. There are certainly much better dessert options in this area."}
{"text":"Came here with my mom after a very large dinner. We were craving the durian mochi and ended up getting the fruity durian sago supreme as well. Thought we had zero room for dessert but boy we were wrong. The dessert here is so fresh and light... we really couldn't resist. The fruity durian sago supreme was excellent! Fruit lovers, try it!"}
