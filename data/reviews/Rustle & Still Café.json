{"text":"My new favourite coffee shop! Walked past today and was drawn in with all the greenery - it's like a mini oasis and was the perfect place to work on my laptop. I ended up staying way longer than expected because I loved the environment. Wifi was great. Their coffee was delicious - Vietnamese drip coffee with condensed milk. I ended up staying for lunch and had their mushroom and tofu banh mi sandwich (vegan) ... but as a non vegan I still thought it was delicious. Savory and fresh. The owners were so nice and you can tell they really care. It's not in my neighborhood but I'll definitely go out of my way to return back."}
{"text":"With the chill music in the background, all-wooden interior, and lush green foliage, Rustle & Still feels like a spa with a lot more beverage choices. There were quite a few coffee from drip to pour-over, and latte options -  featuring Vietnamese-origin coffee and pretty latte art (Rustle & Still's signature banana leaf logo, in a milk-foamy version in each cup).   Debating between Vietnamese iced coffee with condensed milk or a tea, I ended up opting for the Purple Sweet Potato latte: caffeine-free, and something totally unique that I'd never tried before.

I was glad I picked it: it was not too sweet, and reminded me of taro bubble tea but with a nutty, roasted sweet potato flavour made milder with plenty of milk (don't worry, it didn't taste like a potato!).  Though I missed out on the latte art by picking the iced version rather over a hot cup, I liked that it the iced latte was refreshing and creamy.

I'll have to come back for that Vietnamese iced coffee next time..."}
{"text":"Another aesthetic cafe! It's a bright place with lots of plants around. They're focused on offering Vietnamese style food and drinks. They offer banh mi on their food menu and viet style ice coffee with condensed milk. I got the opportunity to try their matcha pandan latte and was very impressed. I'm not a huge matcha fan but I enjoyed this drink cause it was still slightly sweet and no matcha bitterness. I can't wait to come back and try the viet ice coffee. There's a lot of space available to sit  so I would probably enjoy studying here. They also offer free wifi and take card! Service was also great! Owner offered us samples of their baked goods!"}
{"text":"This is a new Vietnamese coffee place in Koreatown. Great selection of coffees with unique flavours like pandan latte (green leaf drink in Vietnam) and even purple sweet potato latte. I stopped by for a quick Vietnamese iced coffee which was perfect (strong and sweetened with condensed milk, small volume). The seating is really ample. It was very busy on Saturday afternoon. But the atmosphere was very comfortable and the many plants and large window makes it feel outdoors. A perfect place for Banh mi (Vietnamese subs) and drinks!"}
{"text":"Just what this area needed - a Vietnamese inspired cafe! As soon as I heard of the inventive drinks at Rustle & Still, I knew I had to check it out - if only for the cool Yelp photos I'd get out of it. ;) Well, gut instinct is never wrong when it comes to food and drinks! As soon as I entered this coffee shop, I fell in love with the bright, well-lit, and spacious interior. There are a variety of seating arrangements, including benches, chairs by the window, and a longer table near the back. Their staff are also super kind, which goes a long way when you haven't had your daily coffee fix yet. 

Now on to the drinks! I ordered the matcha pandan latte because I was intrigued by this unique combination. If you ask at the counter, they let you smell pandan leaves to get a sense of the fragrance that will be in your drink. Essentially, pandan is the \"vanilla of Asia,\" but I found the flavor much less sweeter than vanilla. Very different from anything I've tried before, but it does offset the typical bitter taste of matcha. Probably just my personal preference, but I'm not really sure I actually like the smell of pandan. I also do wish this drink was served a little warmer. At $5.55 after tax, this drink was pretty pricey but good to try for a one-time thing. Anyways, if that doesn't float your boat they also serve up other drinks like a sweet potato latte, more typical coffees, and their take on the vietnamese coffee with condensed milk. I'll have to come back for the vietnamese coffee! 

I didn't order their bahn mi so can't comment on that. But I did have their carrot cake/bread and would pass on that! It was too dry tasting, as if it was not freshly baked. 

Overall, I'd give this cafe a 3.5 - it's not the kind of cafe that I'd keep returning to on the daily because of the high price point for the area, but it is the sort of place you go when you want to try something new like the matcha pandan latte!"}
{"text":"My new fav neighbourhood find! Came across this gem with a colleague on our way home and it's safe to say I've come back at least three times in the next two weeks with even more people. It's so good I just wanna share how much cooler annex/k town has become"}
{"text":"Headed to Rustle and Still for breakfast and absolutely loved the place! We got a lemongrass chicken banh mi, a lemongrass pork banh mi, purple sweet potato latte (iced), and hojicha latte (hot). 

While both the banh mi sandwiches were awesome, we both preferred the pork one because the meat tasted juicier, whereas the chicken was a bit on the dry side. The bread was really nice, perfectly baked and not too thick like at other banh mi places. There was a nice ratio of veggies, meat, and bun. I do wish there was more sauce though! 5/5 for the pork, 3.5/5 for the chicken.

The iced purple sweet potato latte was nice. At first, the sweet potato flavour was very apparent, but by the last third of the drink, it just tasted like milk. I really liked how they used a metal straw, which is great for the environment. It's the first time I've seen something like it! 3/5 for the drink.

The hojicha latte had a nice distinct flavour, with a subtle bitterness. Worth trying for sure! 4/5.

Overall, Rustle and Still has some of the best banh mis I've ever tried in Toronto!"}
{"text":"I tried their Vietnamese sandwich and coffee. It's big portion and tasty, but takes time to be served. Over all this cafe's atmosphere is good and relax, the owner is friendly. I recommend this place."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the purple potato latte made with almond milk. Delicious. Very inventive! I enjoyed talking with the baristas also, great energy. I appreciate how the cafe is decorated with real plants and basic modern furniture."}
{"text":"The coffee beans they use come direct trade from Vietnamese farmers. I had the Vietnamese iced coffee which was delicious, although not with that somewhat chocolatey flavour that I am familiar with Viet coffee usually tasting like. They also don't overdo the sweetened condensed milk which is great.. just how I like it! My friend had the matcha pandan latte which was delicious (where else can you get pandan latte?!), and we shared a very creamy and smooth creme caramel flan. I also returned later and tried the purple sweet potato latte (good but not as flavourful as the pandan latte) and the mushroom tofu banh mi (delicious!). Staff are very smiley and nice, and decor is bright and airy."}
{"text":"Got the purple sweet potato latte with almond milk and the latte was so smooth and tasted lightly sweetened. The latte had some chunks of sweet potato in it so you can be sure that they used legitimate sweet potato unlike other bubble tea shops that use taro powder and who knows what.

Even though they opened just earlier this month, Rustle & Still already has a customer base with no available seating around 1PM which they definitely deserve the hype they're getting. I highly recommend you try the Vietnamese coffee or the purple sweet potato latte! And an added bonus is the simple yet pretty latte art."}
{"text":"Stopped in because the weather app didn't warn me how warm Toronto was gonna be, and also bc someone said this is the best bahm mi in toronto \"in her opinion\".
Idk about it being the best in Toronto since i'm not from here, but it's definitely good. Crispy bread, rich and flavorful meat (not overly sweet or doused in sauce), crunchy pickled vegetables, and a homemade liver patè. Has a good spicy kick, too, which is adjustable to preference. Just let the owner, Tri, know. He's super nice, very humble. Atmosphere is cute and clean, and there's free wifi. Why aren't you here yet? If i lived in Toronto, i'd definitely hit this place up. 

Also, had an iced pandan latte. The pandan didn't shine through as much as i would've liked, but overall the drink was decent and refreshing. They have milk alternatives for those who are dairy-free. 


So...why aren't you here yet?"}
{"text":"What a gem of a place. The owners are super friendly and the space is bright and airy with lots of plants. You could tell that a lot of thought went into how the space was going to look. As much as I like the coffee, I absolutely adore their vegan banana bread pudding (made with coconut milk) and their sandwiches. I'm thrilled they are in my neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"My friend's tattoo shop is next door so I stop by here whenever I visit my friend. 

This is a very cute Vietnamese cafe. The decor is bright and inviting. There are various drinks, sandwiches, and desert available. You can also buy coffee beans and tea from Vietnam as well. 
So far I've tried the Vietnamese iced coffee, macchiato, and vegan banh mi. 

I'm used to the diluted iced coffee where there a lot of milk and condense milk is poured in so I was a little surprised at Rustle & Still's version. The volume of the drink is significantly smaller but it's also more concentrated. It was kind of too strong for me though and I had to ask for more milk LOL. The second time I was here, I ordered a macchiato. It's a \"real\" macchiato made with two shots of espresso and a little bit of milk. Completely different from Starbucks version. 

I've also tried the vegan banh mi and it's pretty good but a little bit salty. 

I've only been here twice but the person that took my order the first time recognized me which is pretty nice. I'll definitely come back the next time I visit my friend and try the green tea pandan latte next~"}
{"text":"Rustle and Still is a vietnamese inspired cafe, serving viet-tinged drinks (vietnamese iced coffee, pandan flavouring) and light fare (cookies and banh mi for example). 

This is a good place to settle down, get some work done, to people watch or to just hang out. It is spacious, airy and bright with a relatively good amount of seating. My only gripe is the wooden folding chairs/tables makes it a bit hard to sit close to the table as the table legs get in the way. 

I tried the matcha pandan latte - it's pretty hard to find pandan flavoured drinks in Toronto so I had to try it. For those who've never had it before, pandan is often touted as Asian vanilla - it is floral and sweet with a grassy aroma and flavour. Since matcha and pandan are both leaves, the drink was quite grassy, but if you like pandan you won't be disappointed. As a previous reviewer mentioned, the matcha flavour is on the weaker side as the pandan is quite strong in comparison.

In the future, it would be awesome to see some pandan flavoured snacks as well!"}
{"text":"Rustle and Still is a cute cafe in the Annex. I came across pictures of their gorgeous pale purple potato lattes on Yelp and thus had to make a stop there on my way home from work. 

The cafe itself is relatively small, with seating for about 14 people. You almost feel like you're in a tropical oasis as the space has lots of natural light, wood finishes and large plants.

When I walked in I was immediately greeted by one of the owners, who was helpful in describing the different food and beverage offerings. They use single origin arabica beans shipped from Vietnam and roasted locally for their coffee. Some of their more unique offerings include their purple potato latte and matcha pandan latte. Prices are reasonable at $3-5 for an average sized latte. Milk alternatives are available for 50 cents extra.

I initially ordered the purple potato latte. The banana leaf latte art is very photogenic and the latte itself was incredibly creamy, lightly sweetened and not artificially purple. There is a slight starchiness due to the finely puréed pieces of sweetened potato incorporated into my latte.

Banh mi, croissants, and matcha red bean cookies looked fresh and inviting. They also carry vegan snacks (such as banana bread pudding made with coconut milk) and vegan savoury options. Alas I was saving my appetite for another latte.

Before I left, I ordered a matcha pandan latte to go. Pandan, for those unfamiliar with this, is a flavouring found in Asian and South Asian cooking. It has been compared to a slightly green/floral take on vanilla with a slight coconutty essence. The owner mentioned that they infuse their own pandan extract which makes for a less artificial pandan flavour than commercially available pandan extract. The pandan for me added a comforting, familiar aroma to the latte, which also had a noticeable matcha flavour. However I found the pandan just a bit too sweet and thus it overwhelmed the matcha. I would probably request for less pandan extract when ordering the matcha pandan latte again. 

4.25 stars. Looking forward to trying the iced Vietnamese coffee with condensed milk. Rustle and Still is a great addition to the neighbourhood and I can see myself stopping in again for my afternoon caffeine fix!"}
{"text":"gorgeous café with big open windows and tons of plants! pretty cool to have this little spot tucked upstairs bloor right near Bathurst stn. they've got some interesting tea (lattes) that will definitely become one of your everyday craves and even offers vegan options for food/snacks"}
{"text":"My first review! How exciting! As a Vietnamese-Canadian I was wildly excited to go here, the only place that I know of its kind. The cafe is located above some stairs, so keep your eyes peeled for the sign on the sidewalk.

Upon entry you can see the space is decorated with both potted and hung greenery. The large windows let in a ton of natural light (Instagram photographers rejoice!) and makes me extremely excited to come back when the skies aren't so gloomy. I didn't get to interact too much with the staff because I'm socially inept, but I observed like a creep and service was sublime. 

My drink of choice was a Vietnamese iced coffee with condensed milk because, duh. The drink came in two parts: a cup of ice and another cup of espresso layered on top of condensed milk adding to a true Vietnamese coffee experience. This is not the same iced coffee you'll find at your local pho restaurant where the coffee is seventeen parts condensed milk and one part espresso. Rustle and Still's is for the coffee lover and they add just enough sweetened condensed milk to taste great and not feel guilty about it afterwards. 

There's no doubt in my mind that this will become a Spring/Summer staple and I'll definitely be returning to try one of their signature drinks - the matcha pandan latte or purple sweet potato latte -  probably later today if I'm being honest.

UPDATE: I returned within two hours and purchased a matcha pandan latte which was delicious."}
{"text":"This cafe just opened up, and is my new favourite in the Annex/Koreatown. It's sort of tucked away in one of the split-level buildings on Bloor, and is beautifully decorated with amazing drinks. 

Down with Starbucks, long live Rustle & Still!"}
{"text":"The moment I heard Rustle & Still open, I immediately went over to check it out because I love embracing my own culture. Their iced Vietnamese coffee has a strong taste to it. 

Although they're fairly new, their menu is not entirely complete yet. But for the time being they have banh mi's. I am excited to try their other dishes once they're available. Overall, the interiors are soooo lovely. Very Scandinavian but reminds me of Vietnam as well with the bamboo chairs. It makes me miss home a lot but this cafe will suffice. I'll try to be a regular here lol.

You can definitely get some work done from here, I can imagine this place being super busy during the summer time. The staff are extremely friendly as well. I hope this business thrives."}
{"text":"Living in the Annex I've passed by this place probably a hundred times waiting for it to open. The cafe, decor, and lighting is gorgeous, I eyed it through the windows waiting to be able to go in. Finally, in March I noticed it was open and picked it at a spot to have a coffee date with a friend and since then I've been here at least twice a week, for the last 4 weeks. Each time I've also brought other friends along with me. Partially because I want to help them expand customer base and partially because I want to try what my friends order so I can get a better overview of the menu without spending as much coin Haha.

Space: So like I said the cafe itself is gorgeous. Plenty of natural light pours through the floor to ceiling windows (and plenty of bright potlights when it's gloomy out), plants fill every corner of the space and it feels as though you're in a quiet cafe somewhere warm and sunny even as it pours rain outside.

Drinks: I've gotten to try their Vietnamese iced coffee w/ condensed milk, their hojicha latte, and their unique offerings; the purple sweet potato latte and the matcha pandan latte, both iced and hot. Their coffee is what a wanted, a dark roast, slightly tart coffee offset with sweet condensed milk.
But I've gotta say I'm obsessed with their matcha pandan latte. The pandan imparts such a fragrant slightly sweet taste... its to die for. I usually buy pandan soy milk from sauga so it makes sense when I found my winning combo to be the Pandan Matcha Latte with Soy Milk and Iced. The hot version is just as great but I find the pandan a bit more strong when hot, so be conscious of that.
Their Purple Sweet Potato Latte is great as well. I find it to be better hot than iced. They use real sweet potato to create the drink so it is very starchy and when served hot, the potato definitely mixes better into the milk. Drinking it iced will give you a chunkier drink which may be up your alley if you enjoy eating sweet potato or are a fan of those fresh taro bubble teas. Almond milk would also be a great version if you have a sweeter tooth.

Food:
I've tried the deluxe R&S, lemongrass pork, and chicken Banh Mi's. The are about $8 which is a bit much compared to what some viet people are used to paying for a 'banh mi' but they do put a more artisan spin on the sandwich. They're all delicious and I love the pate they use. I prefer the meat variants and a quick tip, you can ask for a mix of pork and chicken in your sandwich!
Their snacks or desserts are great as well, the banana bread is super moist and the flan not too fragile.

The frequency of my visits are a bit embarrassing but the owners/staff are super friendly and service is amazing so I don't mind that they recognize me, I guess that's the point of the local coffee shop. I've even gotten into a routine where I sit there with my viet coffee and grab a MPL on my way out."}
{"text":"OMG the vegan 5 spiced Banh mi is my ultimate favourite! It contains sautéed tofu with 5 spice sauce, baby bella mushrooms and mushroom walnut pate. The coffee however is very strong, but I'm not a coffee drinker so I can't appreciate coffee like those avid Starbucks drinkers. My friends and I enjoyed our banh mi. The baguette is untraditional but very good with added sesame seeds. The staff is very friendly and super passionate. The atmosphere is very quaint and modern. I'm coming back for more of that vegan Banh mi!"}
{"text":"amazing adorable place!!! love the lighting and deco, very comfortable atmosphere with lots of plants. just what this area needed! I've been looking for a cafe in this area forever. also the service was very sweet.

i had the sweet potato latte, sesame cookie and lemongrass chicken bahmi. i love sweet potato so it was nice to see it in a latte. the banh mi was super fluffy and fresh tasting and flavourful. the sesame cookie had a great flavour, and not too sweet. ill definitely be back to try the other things."}
{"text":"Super aesthetic and cute on the inside. I got the matcha pandan latte and I love it. Nice quiet place if you want to just chill. Their banh mi is a little expensive though."}
{"text":"Banh MI were overpriced for BANH MI but I guess regular priced cafe sandwiches... Compared to other cafes/coffee shops that price their sandwiches for the same but prepare them from frozen, I guess this is one up. The bread is big, toasted and has sesame seeds. The length of the sandwich is medium sized. Smaller than the large you would get from a Banh MI place. Also the Banh MI is served on paper in a woven basket which is cute but I can see getting greasy and dirty in the future. 

My pork sandwich was super fatty. More than half fat. Each of my friends who also got the lemongrass sandwich said that theirs had big pieces of fat too. The flavour was good but Im usually a person who picks out the fat from my food and even chicken skin.

The drinks (iced pandan latte and iced purple potato latte) were very unique and ASTHETIC. Flavour was pretty good, I enjoyed them and would reccomend them as something new to try. I would not get Banh MI from here again though.

Other points of interest:
- you put your dirty dishes into a bin that is identical to their garbage can that is next to their real garbage can. I can see people getting them mixed up here. 
- They have metal straws!
- Water is self serve by the main entrance and has lemons inside.
- Free WiFi too! Very cafe
- Beautiful decor"}
{"text":"This is my spot. I've been here several times, and the quality is pretty consistent. I've had some of their baked goods, including the coconut croissant, which is definitely worth getting. My boyfriend and I also tried their bahn mi. We had the chicken, and also the vegan bahn mi, and the latter was super delicious (it has sauteed crimini or portobello mushrooms and a super delicious walnut pesto); however, when I ordered it again a week or two later, it wasn't quite as good as the first time. To the person who complained about how much the bahn mi costs, this cafe is a totally different concept from a $2 bahn mi shop, and I would argue that the quality of the fillings is much higher, thus justifying the higher price. 

I quite like the hojicha latte here. The tea flavour's strong, and is not too sweet, and there's a metal straw, which I love. I've tried the coffee here, too. It's a different concept from traditional Vietnamese coffee in that they use a shot of espresso here, rather than drip coffee which is percolated through the metal filters. The coffee is a little bitter for me, but I tend to like things sweet.

One thing I would like is if there were more electrical outlets. I think there are electrical outlets near the tables in the back, but electrical outlets by the window would be useful for people who want to charge their phones.

I'm so glad a place like this exists. It has a very calm vibe, and I hope the cafe is here to stay. A very fun addition to the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"What a great spot!! Everything is great from the atmosphere to the service to the excellent food & drinks. Really interesting selection. The purple sweet potato lattes are pretty and soothing! Banhmi is fabulous. Love the sesame cookies. Best mocha I've had in Toronto. Nice glassware. I'll be here a lot to get some work done!"}
{"text":"I found this Vietnamese gem while strolling through Koreatown. Their chicken banh mi is out of this world. I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Rustle & Still caught my eye with it's lavendar tinted latte... turns out it was sweet potato latte.  So I bookmarked this spot and was hoping my weekend brunches took me close to here.  I'm glad I did stop by and enjoyed my drink here.

Korea town is FILLED with so many choices of bubble teas.  You can shoot out a boba out of a straw and probably hit 2 spots before landing.  Trying to find a coffee spot though... much harder.  There was my favourite Put a Cone on It but Rustle & Still is a new comer and a welcomed addition.  It sits above the street level with a huge window to let in a lot of light.  The cafe is cute with it's many little bamboo table seating and lots of plants hanging about.  Compared to other spots, it's more much serene and for now, lots of seating to not compete with other people.  

Service is cordial, polite, and quick.  We saw their menu and it had lots of loose leaf teas but also many interesting Asian based drinks.  Sweet Potato latte, Matcha Pandan, Vietnamese single origin coffee, and Vietnamese Iced Coffee.  They also serve several items of food like banh mi sandwiches and pastries.  It was nice to see a young group of owners provide the best they could.

Matcha pandan latte - Pandan added to the matcha in such a great way. Pandan is called the 'vanilla of Asia'.  It is used in sweets but instead of a warm sweet note of vanilla, it's a lighter and more floral sweetness that gives your drink a more Asian tropical feel.  It balanced the bitter matcha.  So at first you get hit with the floral sweet notes and then a tiny pop of  true matcha at the end.  I thought this was a great way to update the normally bitter tea.  4/5

Flat white - I actually liked this a lot.  It was closer to a cappuccino with more of a overfrothed top and milkier drink BUT the beans were different.  More vegetal and with a greater bitter bite than an earlier spot, it still had a pleasant robust deep coffee flavour.  I found it similar to the strong bold coffee notes that I'm used to tasting in the Vietnamese Coffees with hickory.  4/5

Overall, great spot to relax for 30 minutes or more and enjoy some great drinks.  They had a few croissants available but they sold out quickly as the matcha ones look so nice!  Im glad to see this spot open up in Korea town!"}
{"text":"If you're walking on Bloor and encounter leaves rustling around a barber's pole, you've arrived at---not another ajumma's go-to for refreshing her perm---where you'll find, in my humble opinion, Toronto's best banh mi, as well as the only cafe that takes such an all-encompassing and passionate approach to leveraging the flavours of the Vietnamese bean.
I think I've had every single drink here and while I'm no connoisseur/caffeine-head, I can say I've enjoyed them greatly and have only left their corresponding iced variants. My girlfriend who is a much bigger cà phê sa ?á fiend than I easily gave her approval so there's that. Personal favourite is probably the sweet potato latte.
The crusty sesame bun, the house-made do chua, mayo, and liver pate are what make the banh mi here more comforting than the OG shops of Spadina and more satisfying than the BMB. I've been dying to come back after hearing about the fried egg option.
The cafe space itself is trendy with plenty of greenery and perfect for study sessions.
An easily decisive perfect score."}
{"text":"Can i just say this place is amazing? 

Hidden within the rows of korean hair salons and soon tofu places, there now exists a new Vietnamese coffee house. Walking in, we were greeted with the smell of viet coffee and smiling hosts. I absolutely love everything about this cafe, decor is trendy, light and very green with all the plants around the cafe. It gives a very clean but rustic feel even without the heavy wood accents you normally see at other restaurants. Once we ordered, we sat down by the window while the server (aka the owner) brought us our food. 

We ordered sweet potato latte, iced viet coffee and avocado ice cream (kem bo). I must say, their bahn mi is probably one of the best ones ive had in toronto. The viet coffee and the latte as a close second. Everything was so good i literally wolfed everything down. Their bahn mi featured freshly baked sesame buns with lemon grass pork and house made chicken pate. Unfortunately i had to share the other half of the sandwich with my bf, so this little bite of heaven ended short. They have some serious espresso machines too (if youre a fan of those). All their coffee are sourced from Vietnam, which is stronger and bolder than a lot of the american coffees. Even though I dislike strong coffees from sb or timmies, I absolutely love their viet coffee. Id give that a two thumbs up! 

I will def come back again to try their pandan latte and have more of that delish banh mi. Thanks for having us! 10/10 recommend."}
{"text":"Came here on Saturday with my friends. I loved the atmosphere and the decor used. It's a very relaxing vibe with all the greenery around the place. I got their hojicha latte and it was to die for! I absolutely loved that the tea taste was stronger and overall not overly sweet. 

My friends both got the matcha pandan latte which was a strong matcha with a hint of coconut. Again the tea was nice and strong!"}
{"text":"I come from LA, land of indie coffee shops, and this is an A+ all around."}
{"text":"Uh hello AMAZING they use REUSABLE STRAWS, the owners are taking orders so he's super nice and they have this super fun elderberry hibiscus cold drink. And the greenery inside here is so lovely and it's bright and airy I'm already planning to come back to try their food! This place also makes me want to open my own place bcos it's so inspiring!"}
{"text":"Awesome coffee and great cheap food! Can't go wrong.

Lemon grass bahn mi was better than deluxe."}
{"text":"Rustle & Still is located a few minutes away from Bathurst/Bloor on Bloor. The coffee shop is situated on the 2nd floor and is beautifully designed and has drink and food items offered all day (like Vietnamese coffee and banh mis!). The lush greenery/plants and wooden tables/chairs are a nice touch as it conveys a warm and welcoming atmosphere. There is also free wifi which is a bonus if you want to get some work done. 

I dropped by for lunch on a Monday around 11:30am and the shop was completely empty. I was greeted by the friendly owners as I ordered an Americano and a Rustle & Still banh mi. Total cost of the 2 items was $12. It caught me by surprise that they use direct trade coffee from Vietnamese coffee farmers (which is totally awesome! I will need to ask next time I go if I can buy a bag of beans :D). I definitely enjoyed my Americano as it was perfectly made. The banh mi was amazing as well. I'm a huge fan of these Vietnamese sandwiches so I have tried a variety of them in the city. The bread of the banh mi was toasted just perfectly where it had a great crunch to it without being too hard; it was also warm and all the ingredients in the banh mi worked well together. I have to also give a thumbs up to the homemade pate; it was delicious and worked well with all the flavours of the sandwich, easily the highlight (along with the bread!). 

Service was very friendly and attentive. As more customers came in, the owners did not hesitate to make sure everyone was satisfied with their orders and also chatted with a few customers. 

Overall, great food, coffee, and service. Banh mis and coffee are two of my favourite things so it's great that now I have a place to go to if I want to have both at the same time. Will definitely recommend this place to others and be back for more!"}
{"text":"Came to Rustle and Still today with my bestie for the first time. We was looking for a quite place to talk and we decided to come here. One of best coffee shop I have ever been. The atmosphere and the view are outstanding.Not to mention they have the best Vietnamese Banh Mi in town. The bread is just enough crispy. We ordered one matcha latte and sweet purple potatoes latte. The Matcha latte was just average but the sweet purple potatoes drink was SERIOUSLY GOOD. It may seem unfamiliar but you really need to try it out. Come on! Look at that pastel purple! Did I tell you the staffs are really nice?"}
{"text":"I love it here! This cafe recently opened up in the area and I'm already in love with it. The owners are very friendly and the place is super clean with lots of natural light, pinterest looking furniture and books, and various plants. As soon as I walked in, I already gave this place an A+ for its appearance.

For the food/drinks, I was quite impressed too. For drinks, I tried the matcha pandan latte and the hojicha latte - both very tasty. The matcha pandan latte was very sweet and the hojicha did not disappoint. I'm a huge hojicha fan and I know I'll definitely be back for more. For food, I tried the caramel flan - this was also very good, I just wish the portion size was a bit bigger. I hear the purple sweet potato latte (taro latte) and the banana bread are absolutely delicious so I'm definitely trying these next time I come here. Definitely come check this place out if you're in the area."}
