{"text":"Some categorized the products that they sell as jerky - and it is kinda correct. Technically, it is a type of Bakkwa - which is a type of Chinese-style dried-meat product. The ones that Oriental Recipe sell are done in Singaporean-style. If any of you ever been to Singapore, I think you would recoqnize chain stores called Bee Cheng Hiang which specialized in this kind of product.  The product itself is very good. Imagine eating Chinese BBQ pork, but it is dried but not completely dried with some moisture still in it. Now imagine eating that in small strips. The only other place that I know that serves this type of products is in Richmond, BC and it is not as good as the ones here. Oriental Recipes' product has better consistency.  Most of the products are grilled in front of the customers. I chatted with the owner as I waited for my order and he mentioned that there are people all over coming by and buying his products. I made a recommendation that he should put up a world map on his store and have his customers pin thumbtack pins to the map to indicate where they're from."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Purchased a groupon for $25 worth of jerky. Visited the store today and as soon as I mentioned that I had a groupon, the staff's facial expression changed (in a bad way!). If they're so unwilling in serving customers that purchased a deal then they should not be pushing these deals out there.  The jerky itself is so so, too greasy. It is soft however, which is better compared to prepackaged boxed jerky that one can purchase at a grocery store.  The seaweed pork jerky was so so, I didn't really taste seaweed, it may have over burnt and lost the seaweed flavours.  Overall, I would not go back."}
{"text":"Their store is impeccably clean and they have samples to try, which was great as I was sold with the first taste.  So different from western style jerky with a variety of flavours (spicy, black pepper, five spice, lemon chicken) and meats (chicken, pork, beef).  I shared it with co-workers and got rave reviews all around.    The staff were all helpful and really friendly...the jerky is a new favourite of mine..hands down a great snack.  I will be back for more.  And the owner made mention of future plans to be able to order online and have it shipped...how much handier can you get!"}
{"text":"I agree with other Groupon users.  Their attitude changed when you tell them you got Groupon.  I bought the $40 value and the lady said you can have 12 pieces and that it.  I asked to try a sample and she is like no samples.  The jerky was ok but the service was horrible."}
{"text":"\"Singaporean style jerky\" caught my eye.  I bought BKH Jerky previously and knowing how good it was, I'd bought into the Oriental Recipes wagjag groupon full tilt (5 vouchers).  It was the worst beef jerky I have ever tasted.  Imagine a raw meat ball that's been flattened into a paper sheet and cooked up for you to eat .  Oriental Recipes version of jerky consist of  chopped and formed meat, rather than traditional sliced, whole-muscle meat.  You've been warned... caveat emptor."}
{"text":"Once you walk into the plaza, this is all you smell. My nephew loves this place, and had so many slices. Great snack option!"}
{"text":"I saw a pretty good deal on Groupon so I decided to check this place out. Its ok but definitely not of the same quality as the ones in Asia. Still, I would come back if I crave pork jerky. TiP: Reheating it on the stove/microwaving it for 20 seconds makes it yummy again!"}
{"text":"Pork jerky time!!! We missed them so much and there weren't a good quality one in the east coast.  After we tasted a couple of samples, we knew we had to bring some home.  They even vacuum wrap it and confirmed it would be fine crossing the border with it.  I think price wise it is cheaper than Spore or Taiwan (at least the one at the airport). Can't wait to snack on them soon!  Going to be fighting with the hub since we only get a couple of boxes."}
{"text":"Oriental Recipes offers Singaporean style jerky.  This tender, slightly sweet/salty and smoky slice of meat is grilled right in front of you. This type of jerky should not be confused with what you would find at 7-11. The jerky here is tender and packed with flavor.   Free samples are offered in front of the store. The employees here are very friendly and helpful. You can buy a few slices or bigger bags filled with meaty goodness. Perfect to snack on or to give as a gift. Their jerky is leaning towards the pricier side but definitely high quality.   A must visit if you're in the First Markham Place area.   Note: Don't forget to stop by Fruit Jungle next door for some bubble tea. They are forking out the real stuff. Two great places right beside each other. Win!"}
{"text":"I learn something NEW everyday, mostly unintentional. I learned that the Singapore or Macau Jerky I've been eating all these years, Wikipedia notes it as \"Bakkwa Jerky\".  The second thing that I learned while some of you might have already noticed is that there's a new Singapore-style Pork Jerky specialty shop in town(Town of Markham).  Personally I don't remember Pork or Beef Jerky that well but most of the ones noticeable are Vacuum-sealed meaning it holds longer than the FRESH ones that are made in-house at Oriental Recipes.  Most of you in-the-know will recognize the Soo Singapore Jerky brand that features the Merlion logo.  I praise them for bringing this specialized Asian tradition/concept to Markham as before if you wanted this product, you would have to go to a Chinese Snack or Grocery to purchase the pre-packaged variety with very minimal selection.  The truth is that fresh Jerky taste very different from pre-packaged Jerky while both are just as addictive if you're into that sort of snackfood.  As with any Jerky product, it doesn't come cheap which makes it an occasional treat more than a daily ritual. In Asia, it is a popular item as a Gift.  Maybe I'll keep that in mind next time if I'm feeling generous.    100 gram = $5.00  As for how it taste I've got to say even when comparing it with the Macau Fresh Pork Jerky that my friend smuggled in, it's very comparable but the grilled flavour lingers much more with the ones Oriental Recipes grills that you can sometimes observe from time to time.    Oriental Recipes only offers Pork not Beef but has a choice between spicy or non-spicy.  Last thing I have to say is that for those Pork Jerky fans out there, if you're into this stuff you better go support it before it becomes another obsolete memory.  You know how quickly those shops at First Markham Place shuts down, just take Shin Jung Korean for example."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!!! Authentic Beef Jerky style that I get from HK. I usually order the original Pork as I find it the best one. However, if you are uncertain which jerky you want you can ask them to cut you a small piece for taste testing! It's pricey for the little amount you get but beef jerky in general is not cheap."}
{"text":"Warning: highly addictive good stuff!  Just as other reviewers have mentioned, this store sells jerky that is comparable to those in HK and Taiwan.  They have a variety of flavours, which you may ask for samples if you're not sure what to get.  I usually end up with the original pork or spicy pork straight from the grill -- it's softer and really tasty!   For the freshly-made jerky, you'll need to consume these in 4-5 days.  If you want something with longer shelf life, or in my case, hoarding when I travel back to the US, I just get a couple of vacuum-sealed packs (2 for $10) to go."}
{"text":"If you really need your fix of beef/pork jerky, then this would do. But this is definitely not comparable with the quality of jerky overseas, it's drier and the meat itself has a bit of a \"pork\" odour.   You can watch them make it fresh and sometimes they do have pieces cut out for tasting. Two pieces of pork jerky was around $5.8, which isn't so expensive, but the quality of the food and service is rather poor."}
{"text":"Decided to try out this Asian style jerky place. They made them all on the spot, so they are really moist. Chose a variety of flavours.  Original Pork Spicy Pork Black Pepper Pork Beef Chicken & Duck  Overall, all the jerkys are ok in flavour. My favourite one was the spicy pork and beef. The beef one was a bit stiffer in texture. I would prefer jerkys to be a stiffer consistency. Most of them were like slices of grilled deli meats than jerkys.  I also bought 1 of their imported items from Taiwan. It was an authentic pineapple pastry. Quite good, full impact of flavour, and the pastry was nice and buttery, would get more, but it was quite pricy. $1.99 for a 1 piece."}
{"text":"Love this handmade jerky.  The smell of the BBQ will lead you to the jerky place once you stepped in the plaza.  They are a bit pricy, but worth! Tried the pork seaweed today and it is pretty good. Spicy pork is always my fav!! ** Groupon's deal until end of April:  $15 for $25 or $24 for $40 **   Got 9 pieces for $28 today : )   Just paid $3 + $15 Groupon!! ^^Reheat them in toaster oven for 3 - 5 min will taste as good as fresh^^"}
{"text":"I bought a Groupon today and used it on the same day. I've had both their pork and beef jerky before and the original flavour pork jerky is by far the BEST! The beef jerky is definitely a lot drier. I usually only come here for a treat as it is quite pricey IMO. When I walked into the store, I was greeted by a lady serving at the front. As my mom and I were ordering and picking out the flavours, she noticed that I was using my cellphone. She proceeded to ask me whether I was using a Groupon and I said yes. She immediately told me that I should have told her first before ordering and she quickly changed her \"friendly\" attitude to a mean one. She wasn't helpful anymore and didn't want to \"promote\" the jerky. She looked like she didn't want to serve me anymore. Wow~ Talk about business and a change in attitude. Lady, if you don't want people using Groupons at your store, then don't put it on there.    I think the only reason why people are coming here is because of the Groupon. The jerky is usually very tasty, but now that I know her attitude changes with and without a Groupon, I don't think I'll return."}
{"text":"Really tasty jerky. I sampled the original pork, beef and lean pork jerky. I would have to say that the lean pork tasted the best from the three. The original pork jerky tasted bad... its a light brown colour, and it tasted like it was off... most likely due to the fat becoming rancid. Get the lean pork jerky! It was super tasty. I used the 16$ for 25$ Groupon. 25$ worth got me 9 squares of the lean pork jerky. Taxes are extra."}
{"text":"Oriental Recipes at First Markham Place sells delicious jerky :D I was curious to try all the original flavors, so here goes!  Pork - BEST ONE, very juicy and tender! Beef - also, a favourite :) Chicken - meh, tasted like dried chicken... ofc, why wouldn't it? XD Duck - very tasty, cost more, but should give it a try if you're feeling adventurous! Turkey - yuck, don't waste your money.  Help yourself to free samples offered at the front of the store! Meanwhile, you can also witness how they grill the meat to make these delicious snacks.  Remember to it eat while it is hot, and you can ask the staff there to cut your jerky into smaller pieces - great for sharing :) I also love how they use a stamp system to indicate what kind of meat is in each paper bag - very convenient. Can't wait to go back this weekend to get more #droolz"}
{"text":"THE BEST BEEF JERKY!! at least in tdot!! there are a wide ranges of meat too  would definitely eat again  my favourite snack"}
{"text":"Bought a groupon but had to pay tax on top of it. I'd stick to the pork and leave the beef alone. The beef is super dry and not juicy at all. Not sure if it was because I got an older batch but the pork was definitely better in terms of taste and juiciness. These aren't comparable to the ones I get when I'm in Asia but it's a good alternative on this side of the world."}
{"text":"I am not a jerky fan but I decided to try it because they had different varieties:  duck, pork, beef, and turkey.  I ended up getting the 5-spiced beef jerky.  The jerky isn't dry like the ones in packages."}
