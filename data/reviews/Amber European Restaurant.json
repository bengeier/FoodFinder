{"text":"my girlfriend introduced me to this place..  never tried European food before but after coming to this place i realized what i have been missing out on.   as a first time testing meal i suggest trying the \"Kotlyety\",  their pierogis are amazing,  a very interesting soup is called \"Borscht\".   bottom line this place is great for dates, and if you and your partner have taste buds that respect themselves then you'll love this place."}
{"text":"European specialty meals right in the heart of 'Bloor West Village' in Toronto, Canada.  Everything is homemade and fresh.  An amazing quaint place to dine in while touring the Bloor West Village.    Skip the Fast Food Chains and instead taste  Home Comfort Food at the Amber European Restaurant.  You will love it and will definitely go back again.  Berny K."}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant, since all the times I have been here, I have received good service and good food. The service can get slow sometimes, but that's cool, as long as we're looked after, right?  The food is good and most, if not all, of their portions are big, probably big enough for two people to share one meal. It is a really small restaurant, so it can get a bit crammed in there if it's busy. I haven't been in a while, but  I have to make visits to go again sometime!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of cabbage rolls because the stuffing the sauce is usually very plain and bland. However, the food here at Amber is delcious!!! It feels like it is homemade and the cabbage rolls here are amazing! the stuffing is so juicy and the sauce is the best part with a touch of sour cream! The chef salad has dill on it and makes the salad so fresh and flavorful. I have tried almost all of the soups and my favorite is the goulash, but is is expensive around 7.95 for a bowl. The schnitzel is good but I still prefer the cabbage rolls and goulash pancake. I have tried the perogies once but I didn't think they were anythng special.   I would recommend coming a lunch because they have cheaper lunch specials.  There's usually only one waitress so sometimes it can be kind of slow but the food comes at a normal time.  I love going to Amber and will continue to make the long trek here for their cabbage rolls!"}
{"text":"I love this place!!! Awesome price and service. My fav is the sauerkraut pierogies and borscht. The staff is very nice and friendly. Neat place! Would absolutely recommend this restaurant :D"}
{"text":"The Amber has been in this location for over 20 years. It has changed owners. I ordered the borscht soup to go. I have to say I was quite disappointed.  There was so much garlic that it over powered the reason I wanted this particular soup. Rather than eating  a hearty borsch, what I ended up having was a watery soup, little cubes of beets, few potato and very little sour cream to top to give it that richness and color.  I was very surprised to find kidney beans as well. Who adds kidney beans to borscht ?   I will not return for their soup."}
{"text":"I'm part Ukrainian and wanted to love this place, but sure it was OK.  On a few visits I had Borscht, some different Pierogis (Varenyky?) and cabbage rolls. None of it knocked me out but all were fine. I didn't like the hard grainy 'bacon' bits on the pierogis, and all the flavors were kind of mild without, for example a good 'punch' of tomatoes and herbs flavor on the cabbage rolls.  I recommend traveling in Europe to get a real taste for these foods, which unless your friends and family are making it does not make it across the Atlantic very well. Still Amber is a fine restaurant with moderate/high prices and worth a try. Street parking up the block should be free. good subway access and interesting local shopping."}
{"text":"I was starving.  You know what hits the spot when you hungry?  ...Homestyle Ukrainian /Polish food.  I was in the Bloor West hood and someone recommended I check out Amber.    Firstly, the service was great.  Incredibly friendly, warm, and all smiles! It's a casual spot with great food.  I found the prices slightly higher than other Polish restaurants I've been to, probably because it's Bloor West.  I had the potato pancakes with goulash ($15.95) Mmmm smothered in gravy stew, tender chunks of beef sandwiched between chewy but crispy potato pancakes.    I ordered a cabbage roll (on it's own ($9, not the dinner) They were like \"That's too much food!\" I totally could have eaten it as well.  But I decided to not look like a pig and packed the rest.  The cabbage roll was large and topped with tomato sauce with a dab of sour cream.  It was fall apart soft, beef and rice.  I can't wait to come back and try the pierogies!"}
{"text":"Excellent borscht and pirogies!! I had potato cheddar and my mom had sauerkraut and mushroom. Both were amazing.  Borscht was very flavourful. I would definitely return to try other items. Egg salad passed us and it looked good too."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant for Schnitzel, Pirogies and amazing host of soups!! Menu goes well beyond these items as well.  Nice decor and casual inside with great service! Shared all the above with the Pea Soup and all were well presented and prepared!! Certainly will be back as a regular!! YUM"}
{"text":"Amber European restaurant located on Bloor street west pays homage to Eastern Europe cuisine.  My Romanian lover has dragged me here a couple of times. I am not from Eastern Europe, nor have I ever been to Eastern Europe so I am not really sure what the food is supposed to taste like.  Let's just say that I do not have borscht every night for dinner.  The restaurant itself is dated and unassuming.   I have sampled the cabbage rolls, which were decent and the beef stroganoff, which was inedible.  My date always orders the schnitzel, which is the largest schnitzel I have ever seen in my life.  It would appear that you would get meat sweats after consuming such a meal.  Apparently the perogies are very good.  I will have to try next time.  Prices appear to be a little high, $21 for schnitzel, although it is a disgusting amount of meat.  So, if you have foreign friends visiting and they long for a taste of the old country than Amber is perhaps a good choice for you."}
{"text":"I visited Amber European Restaurant last night with two friends and we had a really good time.  The food was delicious!  The food was European and cooked in a way that reminded you of a good home cooked meal.  I had the borsch soup to start and it was really great.  Next I had a salad, which was okay and I finished with the small cabbage roll entree.  This dish was gluten free and it was really phenomenal.  The cabbage roll is also huge.  So if you aren't too hungry, the small meal will be perfect for you.  Next, my friends and I shared the carrot cake and apple tart.  Both desserts were scrumptious.  We left feeling full but not too full like you get when you eat too much over processed food.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"We come here when we visit high park.  My date ordered the borscht and the goulash soup while I ordered the amber schnitzel.  I usually have the cabbage rolls which are quite good but tried schnitzel for a change.  The salad plate that came with the schnitzel was ok.  I can now say that I had pur√©ed pickled beets.  I can now say I can do without them.  The fresh dill on the salad was refreshing.    The schnitzel is veal which I did not expect.  Batter is light and fluffy and comes with a tiny mound of mushrooms and mashed taters.  I found the flavour rather bland bit it was a ginormous piece of meat.  Still not worth $20 IMHO..  My date's goulash soup had good flavour and generous chunks of meat.  Service is friendly."}
{"text":"Wonderful, intimate spot with just 10 tables. Authentic flavors, with several vegetarian options!"}
{"text":"A friend and I spent 40 dollars for soup and sandwiches for lunch. There were more seniors here than at the lunch room at my granny's nursing home."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place. Amazing service and a quality meal. Really enjoyed the beef stroganoff and veal schnitzel. The schnitzel is expensive $$24) but huge. The beet salad with dill is really aromatic and refreshing as well. Suggest pairing with one of the polish beers.  The waitress was extremely personable and helped us in deciding what to order."}
{"text":"Our group of 5 shared pierogis (potatoes and cheddar cheese & Meat), Amber Schnitzel, Gypsy Schnitzel, Beef Striganoff, and Potato Pancakes with Goulash.  My favourites were the potato pierogis and Gypsy Schnitzel.  Food was very good."}
{"text":"A few weeks ago, a friend took me out for a birthday dinner of my choosing, and we went to Amber European Restaurant, a place that I have enjoyed but not been in at about a year. The restaurant is not very large; it only has maybe a dozen tables, with low lighting and is usually fairly quiet even when full. This gives it a more intimate feel than most places that I go, but it is still a nice place to drop in for a casual meal even if alone. It was the first restaurant that I found that serves Russian food after the Barmalay Samovar on Mount Pleasant closed some years back, but it serves many other Eastern European dishes as well. The service is always good, and the food does not usually take very long to arrive.  We ordered a few dishes and then shared everything. My friend ordered the Amber schnitzel, which came with mushrooms and mashed potatoes and some salads. I ordered a plate of pierogis filled with potato and cheese, and then the potato pancakes. The schnitzel was veal and was very nice, a good-sized tender portion, but I thought the fried mushrooms were the highlight of that plate. The pierogis were very good as well, 8 pieces with onion and dill on top, and sour cream on the side. The potato pancakes were okay, but not as good as the rest of our choices; although I will add that I have previously had the potato pancakes with goulash and that was delicious. I have also previously enjoyed their Siberian Pelmeny (small pierogis with lamb), the Kotlety (small beef patties with gravy), and the red beet and cauliflower soups. At the end, my friend said that we should have had some cake since it was a birthday dinner, but it was too late by then; they do have a nice selection of cakes and other desserts available. Drinks available include Polish and Ukrainian beers, red and white wines, brandy and specialty coffees.  Overall, I have always enjoyed going there regardless of what I ate. As I didn't have to pay, I can only estimate that the bill would have been about $60 including one drink each. Definitely a strong recommendation for a nice quiet European meal."}
{"text":"Pros: - excellent service - to-die-for pierogies...especially the lamb and kraut and mushrooms...I have had quite a few pierogis in my lifetime and the skin to filling ratio is FABULOUS! - amazing potato pancakes with goulash - Absolute BEST tripe soup I have had in my life...tasty, seasoned well, and loaded with soft, tender tripe...my all-time favorite!  Cons: - No high chairs and booster chairs - Beef stroganoff a bit weak  Overall, we absolutely LOVE this place and would eat here multiple times per week!!! HIGHLY recommend it!!!"}
{"text":"Genuine schnitzels and pierogi leaves a pleasant memory.  I try to be here as often as possible cause I enjoy the food and a homey cozy ambience."}
{"text":"Home cooked Ukrainian food. Excellent hearty portions of borscht and goulash. Lovely flavourful pierogies."}
{"text":"Very small and cozy. Good wines.  Only 1 server. Food was excellent. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Excellent food service and price - had borscht for the first time and loved it! Very cozy lovely little cafe !"}
{"text":"Pierogis are amazing!  I'm all about authentic and this place had everything one would expect from a European caf√©. In fact, my world travelling friend, observed that this place made her feel like she was sitting in a French caf√©.  The interior is simple but comfortable. The leather covered chairs make sitting a joy. They have a wide variety of European dishes and the portions are large. The drink menu includes about 8 types of wine (4 red, 4 white), as well as a few spirits and a fair number of non-alcoholic option. My friend and I tried two different types of their white wine. Mine was very fruity and sweet.  For the appetizer, both of us tried different types of soup. I had the cauliflower soup and it was the first time I had florets of cauliflower in it. Quite a treat, not overly salted and very filling. For our main we both had pierogies filled with potato and cheddar cheese. These were the real deal, boiled not fried, brimming with well-seasoned filling. Top it off with the perfect amount of onion, dill and sour cream and it was a delicious feast.  Price is reasonable. With wine, soup, pierogies, tax and tip total was between $20-$25 per person and as I mentioned before portions are quite filling.  There is no question, I will return to this place and I will be dreaming about Pierogies tonight. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Pleasant little storefront with Ukrainian food specialties as well as Canadian standard items for breakfast and lunch.  Very good stuffed cabbage and delicious soups.  Simple but pleasant decor with TV screen accurately showing menu items.  I felt it was just a bit too pricey for the food served.  Service was so-so."}
{"text":"The restaurant is quite small, and was very warm, but quaint. We had to wait for about five minutes a couple showed up after us and was told it would be a 30-40 minute wait as all the tables were recently full.   Overall service was okay, but only one server meant that she had to be specifically asked for things.   We had the perogies, cabbage rolls, borscht, schnitzel and Kotlyety.  - perogies were good, filled with lots of potatoes and little meat, served with sour cream  - cabbage rolls were great, very full with rice and meat - schnitzel was very underwhelming, it was a very large portion, and came with the most delicious mashed potatoes  Kotlyety was like meatloaf with a side of the same delicious mash, all covered in gravy - borscht was not to my taste, I prefer the asian style borscht which has a much stronger tomato taste.   Everything should have been warmer. I like my food to be hot when it comes to the table, and this was more of a warm."}
{"text":"I returned this afternoon with a digital camera and all !   Today I had one of Amber's many lunch specials : pierogies & the chef salad. For under $10, it was most definitely a steal. The chef salad, full of fresh veggies and topped with a lot of dill, was faneffinawesome. It came with Amber's homemade dressing and was a very generous portion. The pierogies, as mentioned before, were delish. They just melt in your mouth.   Can't picture what I'm talking about?  Nooo problem. I discreetly took photos today from the menu to a typical table."}
{"text":"I've been going to Amber for YEARS! i love this place, one of the best in the city to get warm, yummy, and authentic polish food!"}
