{"text":"I've eaten at many, many sushi joints in my life. Some good, some decent, some mediocre, some amazzzzzing (think Sushi Kaji). This place is decidedly decent for Toronto.  They offer free side dishes (owing to its Korean staff) and are one of the few places in town to offer hwe dop bop - a Korean sushi dish similar to sashimi don, but comes with more veggies and an amazing spicy sauce to mix in with it.   This is by no means the best sushi place in town, but definitely one of the best in this price range. Great service, a good menu, and very good food."}
{"text":"Good hidden gem. Too bad not too much foot traffic. Completely empty on a Saturday night. Sushi seems fresh and very delish, even when I had to wait to get home first before digging in (I ordered to go). Staff is friendly. Wish I brought cash to take advantage of the 10% discount they offered. I could go for a cheaper price but that's just me being cheap and so used to paying all you can eat prices."}
{"text":"The food is great and the service is nice. The shrimp tempura is the best I've ever tasted. The chef was so nice, he added 2 extra hand rolls on the side for my friend and I! In the end, they also gave us free ice cream. I love the soup they give us while we're waiting instead of the typical miso soup. Unique with average pricing.  Thanks for the amazing experience if you ever come upon my review :)"}
{"text":"I got the salmon sushi combination, and crunchy udon + california rolls. I also got the crunchy rolls (I forgot the exact name of the menu). All of the dishes were satisfying. The staffs were super friendly and also provided us some information for sightseeing. Free soup and red bean ice cream service culminated my experience here. I highly recommend this place to anyone who's in the area!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place tonight because of the good reviews on Yelp. I ordered a salmon teriyaki dinner and eel & avocado roll for take out.   Upon opening the clam-shell box of sushi roll I was disappointed. It was tiny and sloppy looking. I thought maybe it tastes good without the look. The eels were mushy like a paste. I couldn't tell that was eel if it wasn't the unagi sauce.   Move on to the main, the salmon was way overlooked and I chewed it like I was eating meat (if I wanted meat I'd order chicken teriyaki!). The salmon was tasteless itself beside drenched with teriyaki sauce on a bed of raw cabbage.  The edamame is the same, tasteless. Not even a single grain of salt. They are completely skipping out seasoning the food by soaking them with store bought sauces and totally cheap out on the quantity and quality of food.   I wasn't expecting authentic Japanese food and know well most sushi places are run by not Japanese Asians. But even with this knowledge it's just terrible tasting and small portion food to serve in downtown Toronto for the price they charged.  The worst $24 spent for a one person meal ever!"}
{"text":"Amazing in every way.  Sam the owner is the sushi master.   Highly recommend the spider roll, red dragon and cherry blossom roll. Everything is delicious and fresh."}
{"text":"The only thing really awesome about this place is the Crunchy Noodle Soup.... The sushi is way overpriced for it's size and decent quality.   Only reason I'm giving it a 4 star is because it's the only goo sushi place in the neighbourhood - it competes with Bikurri on King, Itchiban, Hiro, and maybe a few more restos in the neighbourhood. It's great that they have a 10% discount if you pay with cash for take outs and they've also expanded they're hours to open on Sunday.  So, if you're in the neighbourhood and you don't want to make a trek to a bit North or North West, then go here... Some of the sushi's are bizarre - there's nothing really great, only thing I like on the sushi menu is the lasagna roll, everything else just tastes basic.  But still a big fan of the Crunchy Noodle Soup. Service is good too, they're nice."}
{"text":"We went for dinner for the first time after walking by several times. The menu had several different options that were the usual and some that were a new spin. It started off with some crunch soup that was really good. We ordered the lasagne roll as a joke and it turned out to be yummy. They gave us some free green tea ice cream with our bill. The chef seemed to be having a good time and the servers were all attentive and really nice. Thank you for a great evening (and that isn't the sake talking :D )"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised.. I loved their crunchy soup at the beginning ... the food was decent and the service was great! :)"}
{"text":"Delicious food, and great service.  Food came out very fast despite lots of patrons and one server.  Additional perks with the meal that we didn't even know about was the crunchy soup that was put in front of us while we waited for our order, it was amazing!  They have a few different pick up specials for lunch and dinner which is a bonus too.  Overall highly recommended.  We are AYCE fans mostly but considering the area doesn't have a lot of that this is a nice alternative for the price."}
{"text":"I am a vegetarian, so I'm always looking for great Japanese food that has options.  And does Fuzen have options - delicious options with terrific service.  This is one of the best Japanese restaurants in Toronto. Even before I became a vegetarian, I came here to eat their sushi, and was always delighted at the quality food.  I would highly recommend Fuzen for all meat eaters and vegetarians alike. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I walked by Fuzen and noticed it was a quaint, well-lit, unassuming place.  I was in the mood for sushi and they had good reviews, so I decided to give it a whirl.  I'll try to temper my review with the fact that it was a Tuesday and after 8p, so maybe they were a bit \"off.\"  The sushi itself was decent.  It was slightly less than fresh, but perhaps that was due to it being the end of the day. I ordered one of those sushi/sashimi combos and it was reasonably priced.  The size of the sushi and sashimi was about average and the variety in that combo not so diverse (mostly salmon with only 1 tuna nigiri).  However, they did give you miso soup, a small salad, and a sample of their crunchy noodle soup which helped to pass the time while you waited for your sushi.    If I had one true complaint, it was about the service.  It was inattentive and distracted.  They had a number of take-out orders, so the staff was preoccupied with filling those.  I had to flag down the waitress a couple of times just for a refill of my water.  Perhaps that was due to it being the end of the evening, but the service was still disappointing.  Overall, Fuzen was satisfying:  I'd give Fuzhen 3.5 stars for creating a comfortable space with a decent selection of sushi and Japanese foods. I'll give them another try because maybe it was an \"off\" night."}
{"text":"- Very good food, plus free soup and ice cream. - Decent service but be sure they understand instructions - Expensive compared with similar places - Very fresh sushi, many options in the menu - Must try Front Street Roll"}
{"text":"5 Stars for a local sushi gem. The price, friendly attitude and fresh sushi make this the place I go for a relaxing meal with a good book when I am in need of a pickup.     This is not the best sushi I have ever had, but for a \"local go to\" I think it deserves 5 Stars. I am so happy it is in my neighbourhood. Check it out."}
{"text":"Went here recently after reading many of the positive reviews, and trying several pieces from a sushi and sashimi platter that was ordered for lunch at work one day and was really hoping to like it a lot more due to it's proximity to my place. However, while the service is very friendly and super fast, I thought the portion sizes were abysmal.  I ordered the sashimi combination which was supposed to come with 15 pieces of assorted fish, and received 12 pieces of very thinly sliced fish that seemed to be half the width of normal sized slices, and one piece of tuna that appeared to be sliced into 4 minuscule pieces to make it appear to be more slices.   In addition we ordered the roll set including 8 spicy tuna and 8 spicy salmon roll. Many of the pieces were almost half the height of a normal roll, which felt like another tactic to make the dish appear to have the requisite number of rolls, while only giving you a portion of what was promised.  While they did give u a free scoop of ice cream at the end of the night, which was very nice, I left the restaurant hungry that evening. While the meal was not expensive, it didn't feel worth the cost when they are skimping on the portion sizes.  May give it another try soon due to its proximity to my home, and am hoping they make a better impression."}
{"text":"My go to sushi place downtown. Good food and reasonable prices. Also good if you like the smell of sushi in your clothes."}
{"text":"I'm only giving this place one star because the service was fast and even then with the caveat that they brought my sushi out a few minutes after I ordered it (*questionable*).  The sushi was bad...I got the spicy tuna & spicy salmon rolls, here's what was wrong:   -Way too much spicy sauce/seasoning in the fish which covered up the taste and made me question how fresh the fish actually was.. -The sushi was not properly rolled...it looked like an amateur did it. Disproportioned and not tight, so the sushi would start unravelling  -On top of all of that, this place was overly priced! My lunch special (two standard rolls, miso soup and salad) came to $20 including tax. If the sushi was good, I wouldn't be complaining but considering how subpar it was, I was pretty annoyed   Save yourself the trouble and do not go here! I only went based on the 4* reviews which don't make sense at all."}
{"text":"Been here a bunch of times for a quick dinner.  Always solid food and service.  Little bonuses like the free soup and ice cream are great.  Would recommend this place if you are looking for a no frills solid sushi option."}
{"text":"4 out of 5! Great sashimi and maki rolls (right amount of rice)! Recommend the sharing combos! $$"}
{"text":"This bright, friendly spot is several cuts above the usual neighbourhood sushi bar, where the most I dare hope for is reliably fresh seafood. The menu shows real imagination--especially when it comes to the selection of rolls (I particularly like the Caterpillar roll, with eel and avocado). Service is brisk and cheerful; regulars get Japanese chopsticks for Christmas."}
{"text":"This is a great little sushi place. The girls that serve are always nice and friendly. The food is always good. Usualy starts with crunch soup which i find is a much better way to start than the traditional miso soups. There Volcano roll one of my favorites, and to finish it off a little vanilla ginger ice cream. Mmmmm"}
{"text":"FuZen is one of the best sushi places in the city. Sometimes you have to sacrifice food over ambiance, but this place scores high in both. Service is good and fast. Prices are reasonable. The complimentary is delicious."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed after ordering the tuna combination platter. The tuna sashimi was very thin and a little dry, and the roll was completely tasteless. This was my first time there and I don't like to judge when I get take out, but I was thoroughly disappointed. Much prefer Miyaki Sushi on the esplanade."}
{"text":"My friend insisted this is the best sushi in the city - better than Yuzu and Benihana - i had to try it out.  So its good - in fact its really great! But is is the best in the city? I'm not quite sold on that yet.   We started with the crunchy noodle soup as the reviews recommended that.  It was one of the mos unique soups i've ever had. It looked like a mess of everything leftover in it - crunmbs of crunchiness floating in there but it tasted terrific - it really did. We got served tiny bowls of this soup and we thought that was the size of their soup order till a large bowl of soup arrived. Happens to be the tiny servings were on the house - well, had i known that i wouldn't have ordered the bigger order. The servings on the house were tiny but just sufficient for a tasting. The larger soup was around $5 - good price nonetheless.  We also tried the sushi lasagne - never seen that before. Anything with cheese baked on top is a hit for me! it had imitation crab on top and a gooey and creamy mix of cheesy baked on top of the sushi. It was tricky to take the rolls at the bottom as single pieces since they had been melted and binded together by the goeey mix on the top but its definitely worth a try. It sounds and looks odd and unexpected but its done well.  The spciy salmon was good but quite spicy. Spice level was up to indian food spice in the rolls - it was unexpected and i wasn't a big fan of the spice level but the roll was fresh and good.  All rolls came out together on a large boat - so great presentation and really great and fresh sushi in the city.   But is it the best in the city ? the jury is still out."}
{"text":"best sushi place in the area, little $$$ though... but yummy."}
{"text":"Just swung by fuzen very last minute, craving sushi but the grocery store had nothing. What a treasure! Sat down to order takeout, handed miso soup, my order was ready in less than 15 minutes and the food was amazing!!! Definitely try the Las Vegas roll! Will definitely go back, very happy with the food, location and the service."}
{"text":"I think this may be the best sushi experience I've had. I walked in to this cozy, nicely decorated restaurant and was immediately greeted by all the super friendly staff. I looked over the menu which was very easy to read and go through. Due to some allergies, one of the waitresses helped me pick something out then gave me crunchy noodle soup as I waited for my order. I've never tried or even heard of this soup before but it was so delicious. A MUST TRY! It was better than any miso soup I have ever had and I love me some miso soup. Once I got my order all the staff said bye and thank you.   At first I thought that 10.00 (or so) for 16 rolls was such an amazing deal but they are not your average size rolls which I was ok with.  If you are in the St. Lawrence Market area and are craving some sushi, this place is worth checking out."}
{"text":"I recently went on a trip to Toronto and I was googling yelping high rates for sushi and came across this place, and man was it awesome, my friend got a salmon roll and fresh salon sushi and she could not stop going on about how fresh and amazing the salmon was! Me myself as a vegan I ate the veggie rolls and mmmm they were amazing I love a sushi place that has a good selection of veggie rolls, and they did :) The service was amazing as well we had sit down service and we were in and out like maybe 40 minutes if that (and we are so eaters) they were spot on.  Highly recommended if your in the entertainment district!!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Fuzen for several years now. In my opinion, it is one of the best in the city. Everything is always very fresh and good portions. The owners are very kind and go out of their way for customers. They are very loyal to their regular customers. Sometimes I tend to eat there 3 or 4 times a week. They have some rolls of their own creation as well to the regular things in other sushi places. I have never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great sushi! Ordered the Las Vegas Roll; different flavor but very good. Place was clean and the staff was friendly. Free Crunchy Soup! I would recommend"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the full set course B. Service was quick too and had a really enjoyable meal. Good quality good ambiance. Would come back again."}
{"text":"Lunch was on the pricier side - but I had a \"bigger\" special. ($17 for a lunch salmon platter that came with 2 soups, salad, and AMPLE amount of salmon sushi and salmon rolls). I'm totally a fan! The fish was fresh and delicious (which of course is critical), and the service fast and not pushy.  The size of the place is decent, and they don't take lunch reservations, but I wouldn't stress about it mid-week - lots of room.  I'm certain I'll return when I'm planning any lunches in the East side of Jarvis area."}
{"text":"This is a great hidden gem. I love the food, especially the crispy noodle soup. The service is always good and the take out is quick and great."}
{"text":"I have been a regular since its open, I always went there with4-6 classmates during break time in school. We LOVE their free starter, it is small cup of Japanese style noodle soup. If you order pick up, you still get one too! There is also free scoops of ice-cream at the end for each meal/set come along with your bill. Their menu price is very affordable to students like us plus the portion size is resonable, so we would rather eat here than eat at a subway. The wait staff and even the owner are nice and polite."}
{"text":"Wanted to find a decent sushi place around the St.  Lawrence market area and this place popped up on Yelp. With 4 stars, assumed it was worth a shot.  The layout of the restaurant is very basic with nothing eye catching. Ordered the sushi & roll combo and a roll that had salmon inside and out. Service was friendly and quick. They started off with a miss soup and a sesame salad of which both were very good and not too salty. Around 5 minutes later, the entrées came. Well made sushi with a good balance of fish and rice. The fish was not too fishy which is sign of higher quality fish. At the end, they presented us with two small bowls of complimentary strawberry ice cream which was the cherry on top. The total bill came out to $36 which is comparable to many other sushi restaurants in Toronto. You'll see me here again."}
{"text":"Probably the best Sashimi, Sushi, and overall Japanese food we ever had. Just amazing. We had the combo plater (medium) with a generous portion of delicious fish. More fish than rice. Delicious food and very friendly staff.  If you think you had good Sashimi or Sushi, go to this restaurant and you will experience a new record of taste."}
{"text":"Best sushi I have ever had! If your the type of person that doesn't really deal with sushi, then I would highly recommend this place for your first impression, the place is clean and they have friendly service. However, what really made me fall in love with this place is their crunchy noodle soup and their in house creation called \"the front street roll\" its sushi with home made mayonaise sauce on top it is a bit rich so, I would recommend sharing it but its so good!"}
{"text":"This place is for tourists, not for local. This place is overpriced, the service is quite good tho. The quality of the food is not even fitting the price. Will never come again."}
{"text":"I've been to FuZen several times and it continues to be solid in quality and consistency.    There's quite a few Sushi options in this area and at this price point, but the two things I find that sets them apart is they have lots of their own custom made rolls and the service is great.  Many of their custom rolls also come in 10+ pieces so you get decent bang for your buck.  I've mainly had the rolls but tried a bento once and the tempura was done very nicely.  It's a small restaurant, but never too busy when I go.  The servers recognize us and we almost always get a complimentary roll of the chef's choice when we go!  If you're looking for a go-to sushi spot in the st.lawrence area, this is the place!"}
{"text":"Another Japanese restaurant in the St. Lawrence Market area. There are many, this one is middle of the road - not bad, not great. The lunch specials a bit on the expensive side.  They give you a complimentary crunchy noodle soup.  Most lunch specials come with a miso soup and a salad.  I ordered a spicy combo - with spicy tuna and spicy salmon rolls.  Both were very spicy. I think it was $10.99.   It's nice, but a bit uninspired, with small portions, so I don't think I'd return."}
{"text":"I came before a Leafs game and wasn't disappointed!  The nigiri was good and their sushi rolls were even better.  I really enjoyed their red dragon rolls!  The fish was fresh and I love that there wasn't too much rice.  I couldn't get enough!  The tempura was also quite good.   Not too much batter and not overly greasy.  The only negative was the service.  It wasn't bad but the waitress didn't seem all that interested in serving us or other customers.  Overall, I quite enjoyed my dinner here.  Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"A touch pricey but the quality is very good so it makes it acceptable. They give you a little soup which I thought was a miso soup but I think it's more like an onion soup with little tempura flakes in it which was actually very tasty! I had the cherry blossom and red dragon. I was thoroughly impressed with the cherry blossom, the seaweed salad in the centre really made the dish exceptional! The bulgogi dinner is a large portion so you'd better be hungry if only one person is eating."}
{"text":"It's really hard to find a good sushi place downtown. I went to this restaurant guided by yelp review but i was not satisfied. Sashimi was not very fresh and the crunch in spicy salmon roll bit soggy and not crunchy. Little disappointed but not too bad."}
{"text":"Descent. Not the place if u want the best sushi in Toronto. The prices are good. So if you are looking to eat rolls for a good price in the city this is the place. I would go again"}
{"text":"As far as Toronto goes, this is great sushi. The place is nice & the service is friendly & fast."}
{"text":"Very friendly service from everyone.  Cozy and clean with good quality sushi. Price is in line with the area, i.e. is not very cheap. That said, I'd still go back when in area cause of the friendly service!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to go to FuZen for dinner last week based on the positive reviews we had read. Upon arrival, the place looked nice inside, and we were immediately given menus. We decided to order the 40 piece sashimi platter. When it came to the table, the sushi chef had decided to give us 20 pieces of salmon, and a few other options to make up the other 20 pieces in the platter (one of them being FAKE CRAB MEAT, which I have NEVER had included in a sashimi platter). My boyfriend questioned the 20 pieces of salmon in the platter, literally counting out the 20 pieces and asked if they had any other kinds of fish, such as octopus, surf clam, yellowtail, etc. We were told that this was how the platter came, with no substitutions. My boyfriend then told them that it seemed kind of ridiculous that half the sashimi platter consisted of salmon. The sushi chef grudgingly took the platter back, and replaced five pieces of the salmon with some of the other types of fish already in the platter, which still left us with 15 pieces of salmon. I like salmon, but this is just plain lazy; it almost seemed as if we were given whatever fish they needed to use up. I have never been to any other restaurants where there was absolutely no variety in a sashimi platter, and believe me, I've eaten at enough sushi restaurants to know.   Had I known that the fish would be of such low quality, I would have walked out without touching the food. The so-called \"snapper\" (which I am 100% certain was not snapper) was so tough, it was like chewing on a piece of leather. The salmon had an unpleasant texture and was unbearably greasy. No, it was not fatty the way good salmon is, it was inexplicably greasy.  To add insult to the injury, we went to the movies afterwards and I was left with a nasty fishy taste in my mouth the entire night. Disgusting! I will NEVER EVER go to FuZen again.   Hey FuZen, just a tip - if your customers are complaining about the food, you should try to do something about it instead of scoffing at us like we are clueless. Also, a sashimi platter is not a way to get rid of your leftover fish."}
{"text":"Friend showed me this place as it is among the best from his point of view! Really great - very fresh and tasty sushi here! Also the tempura and soups were exceptionally good."}
{"text":"VEGETARIANS BEWARE: My girlfriend  and I ordered takeout. She ordered 2 vegetarian rolls with no egg (vegan) and a miso soup and salad. I ordered a spicy combo of Spicy Salmon/Tuna rolls. We paid and waited. Waitress offers mini crunchy noodle soup while we wait. Very nice of her. I ask if its vegetarian. The waitress says \"Yes, but theres fish in it.\" My gf says \"no thank you, I can't eat fish\" so she offers not to put Unagi sauce on her takeout vegetarian rolls. I am dumbfounded that there is eel sauce on vegetarian rolls but we thank her for not adding it. She brings the takeout and says \"have a nice day.. oh by the way, the miso soup has fish broth\"  So we wasted a good miso soup because this place did not have the courtesy to offer my gf something else vegetarian, but instead found out she doesn't eat fish and *still* had the nerve to charge us for a fish soup.   Food was not up to par for the ~$20 for 2 very basic vegetarian rolls. The side salad was laughably sparse. My 2 spicy rolls were chopped up spicy mush. No idea how fresh the fish was. Small portion for the above average price.   Will not be going back. Too many affordable, considerate, tasty sushi options in Toronto."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place after reading the reviews on urbanspon. The place looks nice and clean. My GF and I decided to order the 40 piece sashimi platter. When it came to the table the sushi chef had plopped down 20 pieces of salmon with only a few other options to make up the rest of the 40 pieces. HALF of a 40 piece platter was all the same kind of fish!!?? I have never seen this done before at ANY sushi place and I have been to hundreds over the years including Japan. This is just pure laziness. People order a sashimi platter to get verity. There was no octopus,surf clam.squid, yellowtail etc. I brought it to the attention of the waitress who just said there are no substitutions. I counted out to her all 20 salmon pieces and said \"don't you have any octopus, surf clam or squid? We like salmon but 20 pieces is kinda ridiculous\" She took it back and the lazy chef just gave us five more of the bad snapper ...(which was not snapper btw) and left us with 15 slices of salmon. Had I known the fish would be sub par I would have walked right there and then. I will never go back EVER! Worst sashimi I have ever had."}
{"text":"Found this restaurant from yelp because they are known to serve fresh sushi. Although that is true, I didn't favour the overpowering flavour of the wasabi on the sushi. I also found it a bit rude that the server did not ask if we were done with our plates before taking it away. Either than that, i have not tried their other dishes aside from the sushi, so i left it with 3 stars."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place.  I have yet to be disappointed.  Friendly staff, nice added touch of a free soup while you wait for your order.  I'm very happy to have come across this place!"}
{"text":"Negative stars if possible. Paid $80 dollars for complete trash. Ordered medium sashimi platter with udon soup.  The sashimi lacked variety, tasted foul, hard to bite.  Went down with a stomach ache right after.  Terrible experience.  Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"The price/quality ratio at this place is excellent.   We had the Combo B which is an assortment of nigiri and avocado rolls. The nigiri were all fresh and well sliced.  The sushi rice was pretty solid too. Avocado rolls were nice as well.   One thing the could improve on is their miso soup. It's very uninspiring. Needs some tofu of fish in it to ramp it up a bit.   Went back again and had another great experience. Changed from 4 to 5 stars."}
{"text":"This place was super tasty.  They have a number of vegetarian options which I was super happy for.  I will come back when I'm able to eat raw fish again! I had a yam tempura roll, greenfield roll and something else...the name escapes me.  It was all delish!  They give everyone this cute little bird's nest soup thing, which I love.  I also had a miso soup and a salad with ginger dressing...also delish.    They end off the meal with ice cream in the perfect little portion.  Highly recommended.  PS.  it's a bit hard to find, because it's a bit hidden on the street, but if you can find it and stop in, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"On the pricier end, But decent quality sushi in a good location."}
{"text":"I really like this place. The rolls are fresh and flavourful, the service is nice, and the vibe of the restaurant is relaxing. They're usually working along to Japanese adult contemporary, and Lionel Richie slow jams.  I'm embarrassed to say I've only been twice -- both times getting the $20 take out special. Will definitely explore the menu further, but very satisfied for about 18-20 pieces of super-fresh rolls. I think it's avocado, California, and spicy tuna. All of them delicious. I really want to dine here soon -- it's a pretty chill, cozy, warm vibe. Did I mention the slow jams?  I've only tried a handful of sushi spots in this area, but FuZen is easily the best one I've been to."}
{"text":"BEST SUSHI! Free soup and ice cream. I like tempura."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place after visiting the TO Light Show at the Distillery District.  What a pleasant surprise!  On a Saturday night, I was able to walk in with no reservations.  The restaurant was pretty full.  The ambience is much like many sushi restaurants with some traditional Japanese/Asian decor and dim lighting.  The service was incredibly quick, drinks and complementary appetizers came out shortly after ordering.  We were offered \"crunchy soup\" and fried dumplings/gyozas, both of which I found to be decent.  The best part was of course the sushi rolls (green dragon, spicy salmon, and Cali) which were fresh, in my opinion on the larger side, and very decently priced.  My tea was topped out throughout the night and at the end of the meal, we were offered a free scoop of ice cream and the bill was presented and taken care of swiftly.  Service start to finish was pleasant with no delays; something I can really appreciate.  I'm not in this area that often but when I am, I will definitely revisit!"}
{"text":"The service is friendly and fast, but the rolls are way overpriced and the Front Street roll was awful. They do provide a free scoop of ice cream at the end of the meal, which I thought was a nice touch."}
{"text":"Tasty and well priced sushi. Great bento box deals for lunch give you more than enough."}
{"text":"You're going to judge me, but I mostly eat vegetarian sushi (I know, I know). I ordered a dinner with yam rolls and yam and avocado rolls. Both were good, and a great size (not so big you're chewing for 5 mins with puffed out chipmunk cheeks). The dinner also came with miso, salad, and a little scoop of mango ice cream. In the spirit of trying new things, I also tried a spicy salmon roll and spicy tempura tuna roll, both of which were actually pretty tasty. I may have been converted. The food was good, but not the best sushi I've had. The service was pleasant and the restaurant clean and relaxed. A solid 3/5 stars, in my opinion."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in this area, Fuzen is where I stop by for quality sushi. Try their Salmon Combo! It never disappoints! They make their own sesame and ginger dressings and both are delicious.  My friend who normally doesn't eat salad, finishes her greens because of the dressing. I've received friendly service during the handful of times I've dined here."}
{"text":"Excellent quality of sushi - it is quite obvious by the salmon sashimi. I also got to sample the crunchy noodle soup, which in itself is phenomenal.   I am definitely returning with more people! When I do I shall update this review."}
{"text":"This place is quite cool but a bit pricy in my opinion. I only had the tamago sashimi and the crunch noodle soup but that quality was quite good. Tamago sashimi is very basic but I was really surprised at how well they made it. The place was very clean and the atmosphere was very relaxed. Not bad!"}
{"text":"Disappointed with my order tonight. Not sure if this was a one off situation. Walked in for the $15 take out order as per usual. Usually they give a complimentary crunch soup. Since its complimentary, I didn't get it this time, no big deal. What disappointed me is that the waitresses are so inconsistent. One would ask what drink I want, this lady just gave me Coke. I noticed that the staff was getting ready for dinner so maybe they were rushed. Anyway when I got home and opened my take out, my miso soup was half full and my salad was also half the usual portion. The sushi was made very sloppy and loose pieces as if I did it myself. Disappointing for sure. I will think twice about coming here next time."}
{"text":"This sushi restaurant is a nice little spot. The service is nice and friendly, and apparently they are really nice to their repeat customers. One of my friends really likes their ginger ice cream, but they don't always have it. I was with them there today, and they made some special for him. I appreciate places that are willing to break out the royal treatment for repeat customers.  For lunch I recommend the bento boxes. I have been here in the past and ordered their set of two rolls, or their salmon combination plate, and I was left unsatisfied because it just wasn't enough food for me... But the bento box comes with edamame, 4 pc veggie roll, soup, salad, and a pile of rice. The veggie roll wasn't totally cheap either, as it had avocado and a crispy exterior. I got the sushi and tempura bento box, and the variety of sushi was salmon, tuna, and some white fishes (one I think was sable/butterfish, and I am not sure of the other one).  The sushi here is really fresh, and well prepared. The tempura is crispy and not oily.  I wouldn't call this place a cheap sushi joint. If you are looking for that, I would hit up one of the places along Bloor, between Spadina and Bathurst. Though there is a variety of fancier rolls that would be more appropriate for a 30 dollar dinner here.  Meals start with soup and salad, and end with a little scoop of ice cream."}
{"text":"Stopped here on a whim before an event at George Brown. Found this place on Yelp through the Nearby search for sushi.  Service was quick, which is what we needed. I had the green dragon, which is my usually go to when it comes to new sushi places. Very tasty indeed, plenty of avocado! We had the gyoza as well which were nice and crispy.  Will definitely stop by again if i need a quick sushi fix before school!"}
{"text":"Always come here for the spicy salmon rolls and they are absolutely amazing. To start off, the decor is nice and casual. The food itself is amazing and although i've only had the spicy salmon roll, the texture and quality of the fish is definitely worth the price. The staff are friendly and well trained. If you come and try this place out, you've got to try the spicy salmon roll."}
{"text":"Clean, quiet place with very friendly staff. I'm not a fan of rolls or sushi but my boyfriend is.  Usually I feel my menu options (for cooked food) are limited to an array of fried foods and flavourless dishes but this place has an extensive selection of dishes.  I ordered the bulgogi dinner and shumai. The dinner included a sample crispy noodle soup which I would highly recommend. The portions were large and the food was very flavourful."}
{"text":"There are few sushi places that impress us. But the food and service here is always outstanding. There are some terrific roles you have to try. We alway enjoy the red dragon and the volcano roles but you can't go wrong with the dynamite role either.   Great fish, friendly service and always a satisfying meal. We love it."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite spots to stop for sushi. I'm addicted to the sesame seed dressing here and the crunch noodle soup is so good. The inari is the best I've had in the city as well. The only thing is the past two times I ordered take out they forgot to put the mayo on top of my crunch roll and its an important part of the roll. Besides that a+"}
{"text":"The food here is always very good and the service is great! Sam is a very nice chef, always greets customer!"}
{"text":"My problem was specifically with a Salmon Roll that I got. Salmon was OLD and warmed up to hide the age. It was the doused in hot sauce and some other sauce to hide it.  I got food poisoning because of the Salmon. I had this meal today at lunch, and advised the server of the issue with the Salmon. She didn't do anything. Charged me approx $23 for the lunch combo with no apology.  Bonus fail: poor ventilation so you will smell like food on the way out."}
{"text":"We were excited to try this place for a la carte sushi because of the yelp reviews but it's nothing out of the ordinary for me and here's why:  1) sushi in itself was OK, all the rolls specials had one California roll and another roll of your choice. So nothing super fancy.   2) the bill for a sushi combo and chirashi bowl came down to $50 which is definitely a lot more than expected considering the food was mediocre and options were rather limited.   So overall, for the price I would say this place is not worth the buzz."}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday evening (we had meant to go to St Lawrence Market but they're closed on sundays who knew). Our meals came with a lot of complimentary items! Apparently green tea doesn't cost extra (so we all shamefully changed our water orders to tea) and everyone got a little soup. They also gave us an order of fried gyoza on the house! And each a little scoop of red bean ice cream. So niceeee.   We all enjoyed our meals, portions were decent (we're American too so we expect large). Everyone seemed to have enjoyed the meal a lot!"}
{"text":"Sad sushi :(  We have been living in Toronto exactly one week and I had been craving sushi. After reviewing a double of sushi restaurants in the area, we landed on this one, mainly because of the good reviews I found on Yelp and Google - boy was I wrong.  While the place was packed and the service was quick, the food was more than disappointing.   Now don't get me wrong, I'm far from being a sushi connoisseur but I've had my fair share of it and know what's good - and sadly, this was not.  I ordered the spicy tuna roll, the yam and avocado roll, and miso soup. Husband ordered the bulgogi. His food was good but slightly under seasoned. Mine was a bit of a mess. The tuna didn't look like tuna, the yam roll was half soaked in soy sauce (which wasn't listed on the recipe) and the tuna roll itself looked like it was cut with a dirty knife.   While the food wasn't the greatest, I told the server I wasn't happy and they were prompt to not only not charge us, but the chef came over to apologize.   Hence the three stars. Food was unimpressive but the service was good and I appreciate good service."}
{"text":"FuZen is a charming little place, with nice service and great sushi.  Orders start with a nice crunchy noodle soup (in addition to Miso if it comes with your order) and usually come with a bit of ice cream at then end.  I've never had anything but the sushi. Sashimi and sushi is consistently fresh and nicely portioned, and their rolls are great - not overloaded with rice like most sushi places. I happen to like their spicy and special maki rolls, though some may find the tempura bits in many rolls make them a bit too crunchy. Just ask them to remove it if you're not a fan.  I'll agree with William L. - this isn't the best sushi in the city but it keeps me close to home - and i'm glad for it. FuZen and Mikyaki sushi a few blocks away are two great options if you're in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Small Japanese but good. Very good service, even you go to just order take out they sit you down with tea and miso soup. Speaking of Miso it's so simple but the added touches of crispy tempura bits and a bit if noodles makes it stand out. It's all a la care here, like most decent japanese places. The price ls are fair and food is delicious."}
