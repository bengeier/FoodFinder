{"text":"Pure neighborhood joint that is relaxed, friendly and has very decent food.  The wings stand up to any place in the city or even Buffalo.  Best sweet potato fries anywhere.  Love the staff."}
{"text":"This is a bar the likes of which your don't see very often.  It's dark, it's a little dingy, and it's often full after work, with people wearing their Union Local sweatshirts and hoodies.  It's like a little piece of Whitby in western Toronto.  And it's all the better for it."}
{"text":"Honestly, the best pub food in the city!  Best fish and chips, by far!  Amazing nacho plates, crazy huge portions.  A simple little old school place but Romi at the bar works the friendliest gig in town.  TVs visible from every angle, games are always on, private room, karaoke, live music, etc etc etc...lots of people who grew up in hood still frequent the spot.  Just great!  Highly recommend!"}
