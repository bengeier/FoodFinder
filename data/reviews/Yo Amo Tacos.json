{"text":"Went there around 2:30PM on a Saturday and had great service!  The decor was very nice and gave a welcome replica of a local Mexican restaurant!  Food was really good!  My mother and brother had a blast and we will definitely go back in the summer and check out the patio!"}
{"text":"I went here a few months ago on a night when it was not very busy and I was rather disappointed with the service. I had to ask for my second drink 3 times before she finally brought it over and made me feel like a nuisance for asking. The food wasn't anything incredible but the guac was the best of the items we had."}
{"text":"I don't understand how someone can give this place 4 stars lol insult to Mexican food! Not to mention how expensive it is! $21 for 3 tacos?! Which comes with no rice or beans on the side! If the food was tasty I wouldn't care about the price, but it was just so plain and had no flavor. The Mexican pizza was something I could've put together at home in 5 mins. I spent $40 before tip for 3 tacos, \"Mexican pizza\" and two cokes. The guy who works there is nice though, very friendly. Just do yourself a favor and go to chipotle."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday night with a friend. I ordered a Mexican Bulldog which came in a mason jar (very cute) but the flavour was lacking. It tasted watered down. Started with the nachos and guacamole which was just okay I would say. The reason I think it's okay is because avocado is delicious and it's always going to be good no matter how you make it lol and to be honest,  the guacamole that I make at home is way better. Our server wasn't the best in the world she would barely come by and we were often looking for her and trying to wave her down but she was never available. The tacos were amazing. I got the chorizo tacos and my friend got the shrimp tacos and they were both to die for. I will definitely come back for those tacos and I would like to try other appetizers. The atmosphere was great, they had a salsa band playing which contributed to a great Saturday night. I would definitely come again."}
{"text":"The location is beautiful overlooking the Ravine in a renovated home and has a patio which unfortunately wasn't open yet at the end of May. The restaurant has lots of potential but needs to be managed better since many menu items were missing since they didn't have tuna. Guacamole, tacos and salad were all good."}
{"text":"I went last night for the first time with my boyfriend .  We ordered the Mexican pizza which was amazing! The food was pretty good, and was not too expensive.  The music was ridiculously loud and couldn't even hear our waitress or talk to each other...was so bad we had to ask the waitress to turn it down slightly. Service was probably the worst service I've ever had in my life, and my boyfriend also agrees.  Extremely slow, and waited forever for our food, bill, and drinks.  We had to continuously ask the waitress for more drinks. She also came around once in a blue moon.  The restaurant was too busy at all..possibly 10 tables there, and only one waitress working.  They definitely need to hire more servers...service was the worst I have ever seen."}
{"text":"I have a Mexican background and I was happy to find a Mexican restaurant in my new neighbourhood, so I wanted to give it a try. First of all the food wasn't anything special, and it didn't taste anything like Mexican. I was also disappointed with the costumer service. I was offered a drink after 15 minutes of waiting. I don't think I'll go back again."}
{"text":"BAD SERVICE. Decor was awesome, food was good. I have no clue how to keep this brief but I'll try. -Server spills drink (to the floor, broken glass) from next table then freezes in space, wordless and actionless, other than putting other table's dirty dishes on our table.  -Manager appears and offers other table, party of about 7, 100% free bill because their baby started crying. Just blurts it out \"free bill.\" -Our table had our food already when the glass broke, but  never got served or addressed after that moment. Dishes never get cleared- ours or the other table's dishes that are on our table. -Still not too phased, I get up to ask if they have anything special to mark my mom's birthday and they don't (Also just saying they now know we're there for an occasion.) - We finish, wait FOREVER, finally able to flag her over and ask for the bill. She takes a few dishes, and never takes the rest. - While waiting, my brother mentions that he got wet with pop when the glass was broken- his back and his coat. I don't think the other table had any physical damage- just a baby who cried.*  Now I'm miffed. - I explain the situation to the manager. He says, \"I gave them a free bill because the baby cried, I can't do that for you.\" I say \"I know\" because I think free bill was extreme in the first place, and wasn't asking for that. I say \"Maybe just like a free appetizer or something.\" He suggests 20% off the bill and I say great. (We were a party of 3.) - After a while the server comes back. It's the same server the whole time and I don't know if she was stoned or just not too sharp, but she was always friendly and unaffected. She says \"Do you want to order dessert?\" I say \"No, we just asked you for the bill.\" She happily leaves. -She comes back with the bill. It's for the full amount. She says, \"Did you speak to my manager?\"  I just tried to kindly explain, because she's nice and I'm nice,  like \"look you made x, y, z, mistake, sorry about that, so I had suggested like a free appetizer and so he said 20% off. I don't see 20% off on this bill so you'll have to change it.\"  THEN SHE SAYS \"Oh, okay so you'd like to order an appetizer?\" THE MEAL WAS OVER AND WE HAD BEEN WAITING FOR OUR BILL FOR LIKE 45 MINUTES! I was like \"No, our meal is done we want to pay and leave.\"   So then she tried to ring up the full amount bill and I had to explain 20% again.  -When she came back with the corrected bill, she handed me the debit machine and cheerfully took off without setting it up properly. I had to flag another server to help. -When we left, the manager was sitting at the empty bar texting. I feel that he personally should have brought the bill so I didn't have to explain things to the sever.   Even with the explanation, she never turned to my brother and said \"Oh I got you wet? I'm so sorry!\" She just said \"So you want to order an appetizer?\" Lol.  Note: The resto was not busy. When the glass broke we were the only two active tables. Note: The servers were very pretty so maybe that is the resto's priority.  *The baby didn't cry because it was startled by the glass breaking. The glass broke. The server stared dumbly at the floor. Everyone waited for her to say ANYTHING. The baby started to get fussy wondering why so much tension in the air. People started staring at it... like... \"Is this baby going to cry?\" And also, \"Why is the server frozen? Is she okay?\" The baby took it's cue from the concerned adults and THEN started crying. In all this time, the server was frozen in space. Even when the manager came in, he stared at the table and the frozen server dumbly for a bit before blurting out \"free bill.\""}
{"text":"Very disappointed!   Got take out from here only to get home and find that they missed the tortillas, so all I got was the meat and veg. Called the location and the manager didn't even get on the phone to discuss the matter. All they said was \"sorry\". Needless to say that I will not be going back!   By the way, I like onions, but man, the food that I had was overloaded with them!"}
{"text":"The worst customer service I have ever experienced. If I say bad I do really mean BAD. This Saturday my friend and I went to this DEN, I do not even want to say \"restaurant\" because if you don't respect your customers and show very offensive attitude and literally make people walk out from that place you are nothing more than an animal. (I feel bad for using this kind of words but we were so offended and humiliated.) I myself work in a restaurant that is why I was shocked by seeing the short Mexican guy's rude behaviour who was probably the manager or owner of the place. I never review restaurants even if I don't like the food I just leave and never come back but I couldn't close an eye on this. I AM NOT RETURNING TO THIS PLACE ANYMORE EVEN IF I AM FORCED BY GUN :) BTW  I am very generous giving one star."}
{"text":"Went there the other day on a whim and were pleasantly surprised with great food and a pretty wide selection of dishes. I had the ceviche to start and tacos al pastor which were fab, and the chorizo for the chorizo tacos was super fresh. The home made salsas they serve are very very tasty, i iwhs i could have smuggled them home with me.  We didnt have time to get into their tequila flights, but they looked promising. We'll check those out next time we're in the area.  Supposedly the owner is going to open a store downtown, which would be great - the spaces downtown will add to the cozy eclectic feel Mexican restaurants should have.  If you do open a place downtown - please please PLEASE import Indio beer - it would be the best!"}
{"text":"2 stars  why because for the food took forever and i mean over 35 mins to 45 mins for food which is not good and back patio was ok but it took over an hour to get someone to turn on the heaters and the kids working there didnt even know how to do it right.. plus when we asked to be seated inside when people where gone and tables are free. .THE SERVICE IS HORRIBLE!  Never Again!!!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I were so excited to finally come here for some latin food.  However, when we got to the place, there was a lady at the front asking us to pay a 7$ cover fee, even though we weren't going to dance. We ended up leaving. Sadly, we didn't get to try anything. They should have a different system in place."}
{"text":"Right off the bat: I do NOT recommend. We went here a while ago on a Sunday evening, so it was pretty empty.  what we ordered was:  Nachos - so soggy & covered in runny sour cream and cheese   Chicken Tacos - my sister said they were good but the flavour was too strong   Shrimp Tacos- my sister also said these had a very overpowering chipotle flavour  Veggie Enchiladas - it was literally just grilled veggies and cheese inside a tortilla covered with cheese and yellow sauce that was wayyy too runny  Side note: the water had a weird aftertaste  Overall: the food was not good, and overpriced. the service was extremely slow and they had the audacity to give themselves an automatic 18% tip for a group more then 4ppl (there was 5 of us) which turned out to be a $20 tip for the awful service"}
{"text":"I am giving Yo Amo Tacos 1 star for food and 1 extra star for its great atmosphere.  Place is well decorated and gives you the vibe of a true Mexican resort restaurant.  Unfortunately the food comes up short and service is quite slow.  Nachos: Nothing special; cheese not melted. Fries: Good, hot & fresh Chicken Enchiladas: Decent, not much flavor and rice was bland. Chicken Tacos: Dry chicken; pickled onions nice touch. Mushroom Tacos: Just plain button mushrooms cut and spiced lightly.  Very simple and bland."}
{"text":"After reading so many less than stellar reviews, i visited Yo Amos Tacos yesterday with low expectations and i was really hoping that i would be pleasantly surprised. Nope.   The Good: - The restaurant itself is really nice.  - Guacamole was good. Definitely the best thing i ordered. It was plain and simple, nothing out of this world, but good nonetheless.  - The selection of hot sauces they bring to your table.   The Bad: - The tacos. Which is really unfortunate when the name of the restaurant has the word \"tacos\" in it. I had the sampler of four tacos (beef, fish, chicken, pastor) and they were dry, boring, and falling apart. Even the delicious hot sauces couldn't save them. The tacos (albeit a decent size) were on the pricier side (about $5 a piece) which would be acceptable if they were delicious. Having used a groupon eased the pain of spending money on these tacos, but even at half price i wouldn't get them again.   Would i return? No. For the love of food, get your damn tacos right!"}
{"text":"I loved this place!!! Wonderful ambience. It truly felt like an authentic restaurant in Mexico. The food was amazing and affordable. Portions are good as well. I recommend the tortilla chips and salsa appetizer. The desserts was impeccable. We had the fried pineapple with ice cream and the banana tempura with chocolate and dulce de leche .  The service was great as well!  Highly recommended!!!! I will go back over and over again!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here with high expectations and came out highly disappointed.  We ordered a Corona on the menu to be told they ran out and only had the Mexican equivalence (Cerveza) which was fine so I switched my drink to a Caesar. 10 minutes later, they come out to tell me their Clamato went bad so they can't make my Caesar... and then when I ordered the pork belly taco they told me they ran out as well. I might as well have asked \"what do you have to serve today?\"  Took another 20 minutes for food to come out and they didn't clear our appetizer remnants (lime pieces all over the table) before they placed our meals down. My boyfriend had the shrimp and rice plate and suffered food poisoning shortly after.   WILL NOT RETURN due to bad service, food, and shortage of food."}
{"text":"3/5 star service 4/5 decor and style 1/5 food  DONT BE FOOLED BY THE GROUPON,  50% OFF THE FOOD ISNT ENOUGH  This resturant serves some of the worst food ive ever had. I spent $45 on 6 tacos and mexican fries, however there was no beef, sourcream, cheese on any of the food. Just a bunch of veggies and soaked chicken thats looks like it came out of a can.   Great place to drink and chill but for the love of God, avoid the food."}
{"text":"Venue was awesome. Food was just okay though, and drinks were pretty expensive. All that said, I would go back."}
{"text":"The first time I visited this restaurant was when it just opened a few years ago. The food was delicious and the menu has a lot of variety. I returned with my friends last month and saw that many drinks and food items were missing from the menu. I asked about a particular drink, and the waitress said they don't make it anymore, however she was nice enough to speak with the barmen so he could make an exception for me, and he did. We ordered chicken and steak dinners and they did not look the same as last time. The portions were a bit smaller and they did not bring the many sauces with the meal. We also ordered the nachos and those were excellent. Will be coming back for the live music."}
{"text":"Time to give this place some love after a rough start a couple of years ago. Opening night had great food after a 2 hr wait. They seem to have settled down and their food is just as good and decent service. Drinks are good especially their ceasars and micheladas. Tacos are good which the steak having a slight edge over the other varieties. Burritos while not the best in the GTA, will be the finest in Vaughan / Brampton area. Service is efficient and on point without being too jovial and annoying."}
{"text":"This location opened this week.  It's based on its sister restaurant in Playa del Carmen, Mexico.  I have frequented the Playa location so have my expectations.  The Playa place is basically a taco joint, albeit very good tacos.  First question is will it translate well here, especially considering we won't have the same ingredients or chef up here.  Both restaurants are owned by entrepreneur Carlo Parentela.  He also owns Le Jardin banquet hall, in Woodbridge, which I know to be one of the best in a vast sea of banquet halls in Woodbridge.  First impression.  Wow!  This is a Mexican restaurant in York region?  The place is decked out and it's not small either.  They're expecting 300 people for the grand opening tonight.  It has a walk out basement into a yard with more seating.  The food is on par with the Playa restaurant.  Tacos were all prepared correctly, I especially liked the shrimp.  All served on wooden flat plates.  Ceviche could have a better balance of flavours in the marinade.  The pork posole was very tender and has a potent blend of flavours.  I really hope this place makes it, I know I'll be back."}
{"text":"I would say 3.5/5 for this.  I had a Groupon for this place where I paid approx $10 for $20 worth of food. I ordered the taco sampler which had steak, pork and fish and something else.    The tacos weren't bad and I thought the presentation was lovely.  It's probably one of the better tacos I've had in the GTA but not even close to Mexico but WAY WAY WAY better than Taco Bell.    I really enjoyed the steak one.  What I also liked was that they give you so many types of dipping sauce too.    In addition, this place is gorgeous.  When you drive in, you think you are parking your car into someone's big mansion parking lot with the nice statue and setup.  In addition, inside is beautiful and reminds me of the large restaurants in Mexico City.   So why only 3.5 stars?    a) The flies.  I saw some really big flies near my table and had to keep shooing them away. Not the biggest deal, but ruins the experience slightly.  b) For the price they charge (even though I had a Groupon), I kind of wish they served nachos.    At most sit-down Mexican restaurants, I'm used to getting nachos.  I was kind of disappointed I didn't get them.    However, overall, I'd still visit again and try something different."}
{"text":"I'm spoiled with fantastic Mexican food down town and Mexican food is my favorite. When I was given gift cards to try this place and the way it was described, I couldn't wait.   Driving into the parking lot, I swear I was in Mexico. The façade is exactly the way I remember Mexico. It almost looks like someone grafitied the place with Mexican characters. Tiki torches were ablaze outside the front door and, the Latino music was loud. I was pumped!  Inside, fantastic. My wife, myself and our 3 kids say in the back sun room. Perfect ambience. We ordered ceviche, guacamole, snapper and lobster tocos and, shrimp fajitas.   This is where the disappointment came. The ceviche was obviously old as it was soggy and not very flavourful at all. No onions? Come on! The snapper was over cooked and came from less than fresh oil as it was dark. Ditto for the lobster, tough and chewy - over cooked. My kids enjoyed the fajitas. They were actually decent.  I won't be returning. Too disapointing."}
{"text":"If I could describe this place in one word it would be UNACCEPTABLE. The food was basic but still edible. The drinks were disgusting. What kind of Mexican place runs out of Margaritas?! I'm also still waiting for my coffee... Awkward. Service was terrible! Our waitress did the best she could considering they booked other large parties, but management is completely responsible for such terrible service. If you are having a large party DON'T BOOK OTHER PARTIES!! or staff them properly. When the manager was confronted he could care less! Completely unacceptable! You're in the service industry.. Service us!!! Rude, smug and disgusting. We will never come back here, nor will we recommend. But what a great story we now have about my dear friend's 30th birthday party. Hope you're happy she left in tears.. Asshole. Actually we might come back for those comment books.. Enjoy the read all!"}
{"text":"EXPENSIVE with very small portions.  The Wait staff is poorly trained and long wait times for food.  The ignorant hostess seems to know nothing about the place and is clueless to her job.  This is an easy fix for them.  The prices are crazy inflated.  Between $6-$9 per taco.  Yes you heard me.  $6-$9 for each taco. No sides or anything.  They advertise an assortment of 5 sauces.   They said that ran out of bowls so they bring 3 sauces in small pill like containers.  Everything is super priced and the portions are crazy small.  The nacho chips are store bought from a bag.  The food is tasty, I give it that much but way to expensive.  The only problem is that the wait staff is useless and doesnt know what is going on.    Takes forever to get your drinks.  Also eating off wooden planks of wood is not too appetizing as wood can never get 100% clean.  The worst of all is the hostess.  Not sure why the owner hired her.  She is useless, rude and has no sense of restaurant operation.  2 out of 5  *** Go to Rebozos for tacos and Mexican food.  $2.50/taco and the food is much much better.  Good luck.  To stay in business fire your hostess and get better wait staff.  See attached drink menu for all of their cocktails and recipes."}
{"text":"2 of us came here on a weekday in the evening time, after driving by so many times this place catches your eye. First off, the parking lot is small so I'm not sure how it would fare on busier nights or weekends. The ambiance of the place including the parking lot makes you really feel like you're not in Canada. It really is a testament to the Mexican culture and vibes at every turn. The employees greeted us promptly and were very friendly, we were offered indoor seating or patio and we decided on the patio. The place is really just a large house with a backyard (patio) full of trees which was lovely. The patio/backyard has typical backyard style furniture which was somewhat uncomfortable to eat on because the chairs are too low for the table. There are hardly any tables outside (maybe 5?) otheriwse the patio experience was nice being in all the trees and hearing the birds singing, they also light the 'tiki stick' cintronella candles like the ones you bring camping for mosquitos which adds to the nice vibe (although it smelled more like gas than citronella). We ordered the mushroom tacos, the chips and guac, and a side of mexican rice. Our server was nice but the food took a long time to come out even though they weren't so busy. When the food came, I was extremely disappointed in the portions. The prices for everything that was ordered was not worth what we received. The tacos were delicious but weren't filled enough compared to what is typical in Mexico. The guac was so basic, and avocados were clearly a day or two too old. I have had better guac at Kelsey's for crying out loud. There were no added spices, and not even any diced onions or tomatoes in the guac, on top of that there was only about 12 chips. Definitely not an app you can share. The mexican rice was an even bigger disappointment, it looked like packaged rice from the grocery store: a white rice with a couple peas and some green bean pieces, and no seasoning again (for $4.50), also came as a small portion. Plain white rice, really? We were not offered a dessert menu, but instead we were told what was available which bothered me because I could not see the prices for what I was getting. Considering the amount we paid for the other food I was not wiling to risk getting dessert and get another tiny portion again. Drinks were ordered at a table beside us and they looked huge, did not drink anything but water so I cannot comment on that but it might be a good place to come for drinks. They were setting up to play music/DJ not sure exactly, we left before it started (after 8pm) so I can't review that portion, although from the time we were there they played fist bumping kind of music which didn't exactly give the 'Mexico' feel. Overall, I will not be back which is unfortunate because the look of the place is so absolutely beautiful and would be awesome for a date night, but the food is too underwhelming and expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"Went there for a dinner. Nice place. Very colourful. The calamari was very tasty.  Fish tacos and chicken tacos were just okay. Nothing special. Service was average."}
{"text":"Went into Yo Amo Tacos today wondering if it was even open. It was so we thought we'd give it a try. The place was completely empty but soon more people came in.   We opened the menu and found our usual Mexican staple, Enchiladas. The price was $22!!! Even if these were the best enchiladas we've ever had (and we've had some GOOD ones) I'm sorry, there would be absolutely no way to justify $22.   Other prices on the menu were equally ridiculous. I couldn't do it. I simply could not bring myself to order $22 enchiladas on principle.  Yo Amo Tacos (or Yo \"heart\" Tacos as the sign confusingly shows) is NOT a trendy or upscale place that can dare to charge prices like this for show. It's a run down joint that really should be fairly priced and awesome like mostly every other Mexican restaurant I've had the pleasure to give positive ratings to.   No way, no how, no go, no Yo!"}
{"text":"Please, if you're thinking of going here, re-think your decision.  My gfs and I had a terrible uncomfortable time here.  First of all, there's hardly any parking.  My 4 gfs and I came in 3 separate cars and not one of us could get a spot in their lot.  Other guests had already made their own parking spots wherever they could.  So even those artificial spots were taken.  We ended up having to park at the plaza across the street.  It's totally a buzzkill having to run across 4 lanes of traffic in wedges.  There's a light you could cross at, but it's so far. *eye roll    Anyways, I had a long standing craving for fish tacos, so I was pretty set on this. After we had put our orders through, the server came back not too shortly to let me know that the fish tacos were actually $25 that evening.  $25, are you crazy?!  It had something to do with the fish vendor and the type of fish.  I mean, it was really nice she let me know, because there was no way I was ordering $25 fish tacos.  Especially, at a resto that had less than impressive reviews.  I had read them before coming here, but didn't have the heart to tell my gfs, since they were pretty set on coming here.  So after she tells me this, I proceed to take a look at the menu once again.  She then starts to suggest things similar to the fish tacos, ie. shrimp tacos, octopus etc.  I then let her know I was allergic to shellfish.  Her attitude was totally rushed, as if IIII was inconveniencing her, while she is there hovering, waiting for me to make a decision.  Like girl, chill, can I get a moment?!  I told her she could just come back for my order and she tells me that the other girls need the till, so she needs to put the order through.  I let her know, that was fine, to put my gfs's order.  She then proceeds to tell me that it could take awhile for my order to be brought out, if she puts the order through separately.  Like how much later could it be?!?  Anyways, I ended up just getting some chicken taco or something.  I don't even remember because it was totally unmemorable, besides the fact that they were disgusting.  The second tortilla they use here is totally unnecessary, as they were rubbery, dry, bland.  An all around sad taco.  My gf thought the same thing.  I ate one and traded her for one of hers and left the third one.  I was not wasting my calories on those.  We had also ordered the poutine mexicana for the table and these were the only good thing for the night.  Drinks were okay too.  Just when we thought it couldn't get worse, for some reason EVERY single server kept checking up on our table EVERY 5 minutes.  I'm not even joking.  The five of us were so annoyed.  Like YES, everything is okay.  It's still okay from when we were asked 5 minutes ago!  And why is everyone even asking us anyways?  They weren't serving us??  Maybe they were doing this to make up for the fact that we were very unimpressed.  Which in turn, just made things worse.  Moral of the story is, don't go here."}
{"text":"I remember going to this place back in 2014 and loved the food, the price and the portions. I decided to take a co-worker here after work recently, and let me just say - God knows what happened in between those years, but it was NOT pretty. Whether management changed, the staff changed, or the cook changed (or all of the above?) the food was disappointing. Back in 2014, they would give you a variety of complimentary dipping sauces which were nowhere to be found on our recent visit. Budget cuts? Perhaps. Not a big deal. Thought I'd soldier on. I ordered the fajitas and the ginger ale, both of which I had ordered on my last visit and remember fondly but this abomination that came out was world's different. I opted for the steak fajitas as opposed to the chicken ones I got last time. Bad idea. The steak was chewy as all hell! The knife nearly cut the plate before it made a dent in the steak. I was hungry and paying $19 for it, so I FORCED it down my mouth. The ginger ale tasted putrid, almost alcoholic and thus, I couldn't even drink more than three sips. My friend got the chicken tacos, and what came out LOOKED and TASTED like very dry tuna. Not to mention, the waitress failed to tell us that the guacamole and the cheese on the \"tuna\" tacos was extra so when the bill came and we saw she had been charged $3 extra for guac and another $2 for the cheese, both of where were BARELY in the tacos, we were livid. Regardless to say, won't be returning. One star because the music and entertainment itself was the only saving grace, and that too - just barely. Do NOT go in expecting to talk or socialize because the music is DEAFENING."}
{"text":"I ordered 1 pastor (pork) taco ($5) and 1 fish taco ($6).  The pastor taco was very good.  It was tasty and juicy without being saucy.  The pork bits and the dressing were loosely piled high.  They kept falling down when I ate the taco.  There were so much stuffs on the corn tortilla that the tortilla broke in the middle.  This was when I wished that it had double tortillas.  (4 stars)  The fish fillet in the fish taco was lightly breaded and fried (I confirmed that grilled fish filet was not an option.  Yet).  The fish fillet was moist and tender but it had no taste, as if it was not marinated.  Since the fillet was not chunky enough, so together with the blandness, the fish taste didn't really make an impact to the enjoyment.  The dressing was very fresh.  It made the taco refreshing.  (3 stars)  The services was competent.  I visited on Wednesday dinner time.  There was a live band playing and singing Mexican songs.  Overall, 3.5 stars.  If I have a chance to experience more items in the future, I will revise the rating accordingly."}
{"text":"Coming from Texas makes you very picky about Mexican food. This place holds its own very well. The food was great and the staff are nice. The live music was a bonus."}
{"text":"Live music and delicious food. What more can you ask for? There's also this view of the ravine from the back of the restaurant. I imagine it's stunning in the Spring and Summer months."}
{"text":"The only thing I can say is the  food was like taco bell but better seating. I contacted the owner before they opened and never heard back about the grand opening even he had my email. No Contact at all, so I decided to try it out. I can say it will be my last time going here. I agree with the other comments on taco's very pricey and not impressed . We sat outside and had to wait to get approval from the owner as our server said it was out of bounds. Later as we sat out side he did tell us it was for special parties only. I don't think they know what they are doing and while we ate outside no one came to see if we wanted drinks. We did notice the owner (manger)  did sit outside 1 hour later with a few guest and was served by a waitress but she never came to our table 8 feet away to see if we wanted a drink or anything. I never go on about a place but must say after this 1st time I will not return to spend my money . The only thing that I can say was good was the table outside and good luck sitting outside as they don't let you do it unless you demand it. I truly will not go back and spending a $100 bucks for 2 drinks and 2 taco meals and don't order the Carlos salad $15.00 not worth it !!! Too bad can't see this place lasting into January with the service I got."}
{"text":"If I could give this place negative stars I would.  We came here on a Sunday evening where were it was pretty empty,   We ordered the following:  Nachos - probably the worst I've ever had, they were so soggy covered in runny sour cream and cheese   Chicken Tacos - pretty tasty, but it had a very strong chipotle flavour  Shrimp Tacos- had a very overpowering chipotle flavour , so much so it was difficult to eat.  Veggie Enchiladas - it was simply just grilled veggies and cheese inside a flour tortilla covered with cheese and yellow sauce that was way too runny.   The water had a weird aftertaste  The service is extremely slow , And to top it off, they had the audacity to give themselves an automatic  18%  tip for a group more then 4ppl which turned out to be $20 for the poor service   I can say with 100% certainty I will not be returning or reccomending this place to anyone."}
{"text":"First of all, from customer point of view despite the fact they serve good decent mexican food, we waited way too long for our food to arrive once we ordered it. The customers that came after us was served before we got our food and we even asked the waiter and he was clueless about what's happening. We even waited so long to get our bill . Everything just took way too long!!"}
{"text":"What in the actual f**k was that? Business partner and I went for lunch. We ordered Guacamole and chips. Pretty sure the chips are from Costco and the Guac was bland but passable. Then came the Tacos. Oh sweet Jesus. They looked good, but man can looks be deceiving. We had the Ancho short rib and the flank steak. Short ribs were tender, the way dog food is tender. Nice toppings but my lord the meat was somewhere between Alpo and Purina. Then there was the rawhide, I mean, flank steak. Our jaws were literally in pain from chewing. How the hell that nightmare made it out of the kitchen is beyond me. Service was friendly. I'd score higher for ambiance and service but the food was so spectacularly bad I just can't."}
{"text":"Finally got around to checking this out! the menu boasts AUTHENTIC PLAYA DEL CARMEN MEXICAN FOOD and I have to say they nailed it.   FOOD *Tinga de Pollo Tacos (3 tacos no side) : very very flavourful and it looks small but trust me it's hard to finish *Chicken Quesadilla with side Aztec salad: the salad was easily one of the BEST salads I've had in my life to date (and I HATE salad lol) quesadilla was cheese overload and the portion was meant for at least two people to share. If you have an average appetite, don't have someone to share with OR are Lactose Intolerant avoid this item lol  *Beef Fajita: comes with a ton of garnishes and tortilla shells, great portion size and I was seriously impressed with how tender the beef was! A little dull on the flavour side but nothing that the homemade hot sauce couldn't fix *Fried Calamari: very thick cut strips but fried so crispy the outside was like a chip! Very delightful texture just wish it was cut thinner so it didn't feel as rubbery. Portion was okay but I found it a tad expensive for the size.  LIME MARGARITA was a huge hit and 10$ for 2 oz is a great price. No room for dessert as all of the portions were enormous (minus the calamari)   Ambiance is like you're on vacation, service is friendly albeit a little hard to track down at times"}
{"text":"I came here on a work dinner, and initially I wasn't expecting much. But was pleasantly surprised.  Drove into the parking lot, and the location had decent parking with some nice stone statures. They had a food van parked there as well, but I assume it was parked since it was right before the long weekend.  Walked up to the wooden door and was cautious since the door what littearlly that, an old wooden door. But when I walked in the place was pretty decent. Nice bar, nice dining area, and cool atmosphere. Gentlemen, yes, there are pretty servers as per my standard comments should that be a factor.   We had a number of dishes and beers. I stuck with the corona, but they had others. The meal portions were pretty large and fill you up. The calamari is good, pretty standard. The quesadillas were quiet frankly some of the best I have had... But note, I don't eat it often so few others to compare.  Overall, a decent place iof you are in the area. A pleasant surprise for me once again."}
{"text":"Nice place.. Excellent decor and authentic food. Little disappointed with drink, specially Margarita. Good experience and surely visit again."}
{"text":"3.5 Star  My Yelp friend was so relax and chill while we were chowing down Tacos at Yo Amo Tacos. The interior deco does reminds me of Playa del Carmen or somewhere in a resort area in Mexico. We were sitting at the sun room area overlooking a small ravine, not a beach but I can really use my imagination!  I really want a real Margarita but apparently the bartender was not in the house and no cocktails or foo foo drinks for me... (hopefully next visit!) I ended up having a Negra Modelo ($7.25)  We also shared:   Fish Ceviche Taco ($6) - Fish or Seafood? Tasted a little bland and the seafood was hard and dry.. I have to remind myself I am not in Mexico!  Tuna Tartar Tostada ($7) - Really tasty and the condiments complimented the tuna tartar perfectly, will order again!  Short Rib Taco ($6) - Meat was tender and flavoured  Fish Taco ($6) - Fish was dry and mushy   (Most of the tacos were really saucy and piled high with fillings, making eating a messy and tricky experience.)  And for dessert, the most important part of the meal, we shared:  Grilled Pineapple with Mexican Vanilla Ice Cream and Dulce de Leche ($8) - love everything! A great combination of texture, taste and presentation!  Churros in a Maya Chocolate Sauce ($7) - Churros were a little doughy but love the chocolate sauce.... and the presentation was interesting!  We really enjoyed our experience! A taste of Mexico up in Vaughan!   I definitely will be back to have more dessert and hopefully a real Margarita next time!  Salud!"}
{"text":"In a nutshell - 1 1/2 stars - Food is passable (but bland)....dreadful, DREADFUL service...huge disappointment as we were expecting much more.  Having reservations for 7:30pm we arrived on time and were told that our table was not yet ready and that we would have to wait at the bar (until the current customers left). We were given menus and shown to a bar table. The waitress in the bar area was, to say the least, lost/confused/stunned. We ordered 2 margaritas and 1 Coors and 1 Diet Coke. The Margaritas came out within 5 minutes. The waitress then walked by our table with the Coors and pop and put them on the table next to us. The people told her the items were not theirs....she left the drinks there and went to the bar. She returned a few moments later and took them off their table and brought them to ours. Really? What if that other table had tampered with our drinks? Not cool and surprising as she only had 4 or 5 tables ordering drinks.  At 7:50pm, the manager came over and said that they had prepared a table in the sunroom at the back...a comfortable room with amazing views of their patio and surrounding trees...I was surprised at how comfortable it was.  Once seated, we expected someone to be by shortly to take our order or ask if one of us wanted a refill of our empty drinks. We waited and waited and waited until finally at 8:20 (1/2 hour after being seated at our table)...one of us flagged down the male server in the room and asked for a glass of water. This server walked past our table several times (while we were waiting) and not once did he greet us, acknowledge us, ask any of us if we wanted a drink refill...nothing...Nada. It was though we were invisible to him.  When he brought the water out we asked if he was our server as we wanted to order (remember, it was 8:20pm and we have been at this restaurant since 7:30). He mumbled something and responded that he didn't know, but that he would take our order. He took out a pad and paper and asked us what we wanted...never making suggestions or engaging us at all. He was, perhaps, one of the worst servers I've ever encountered in a restaurant.  Anyways, we started with nachos....they were very good, although small for the price. 3 of us ordered the taco sampler....4 small tacos of fish, steak, pastor (pork) and chicken. The fourth person ordered Alambre Supreme (he said it was fantastic) Our food came out staggered...the 3 orders of the taco sampler came out and we waited for the Alambre to arrive. It came out approx. 5 minutes later (somewhere Gordon Ramsey is screaming as this is a major no-no at a restaurant). 3 of the tacos on the sampler were bland (the pastor one was wonderful) until one of our group said that they thought they had read that it came with sauces. When the manager came by to see how everything was, we asked if the tacos came with sauce. He acknowledge that they did and rectified the issue immediately. Shouldn't our server have noticed this? The place is called (translated to English) I Love Tacos, after all. The sauces, while good, did not make up for the flimsy tortillas that fell apart while being eaten....or our server who flipped us off during our meal.  Anyways, dinner for 4, which came to $142, included: 2 Margaritas, 2 Coors (draft) and 1 Diet Coke 1 Order Nachos (good) 3 Taco Samplers (average) 2 Side orders rice (awful) 1 Order Alambre Supreme (excellent)  Parking lot is small...we had to park across the street in another lot and walk across Islington.  On the way home the 4 of us discussed whether we would return and the consensus was no."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today. The place looks really cool from the outside. There was no one there at around 2pm (not sure if we missed the rush or if people just come by in the evening). The guac and chips was really good. I think the guac needed salt though but overall it was a good sized portion. My boyfriend and I both ordered chicken enchiladas and shrimp enchiladas. They were both super flavourful and a good portion I think because I was full! The server was okay. I really liked the place inside. It was very Mexican and there were also nice big windows in the back with a sick view. Cool spot for sure!"}
{"text":"If you want to escape Toronto just for a little bit... and imagine yourself somewhere south.. and tropical.. this is the place.. it has a very authentic mexican feel..  back solarium is awesome as it faces a ravine ... very hard to capture in pictures but its really cool.. i think the main selling point for this restaurant..    but that being said, location is not the best as its pretty far from where i live and you need a car.  presentation is good and service was excellent... very polite staff and management who came to check up on us..  food was authentic mexican tasting... only deducting a point because of price.  it is on the expensive side ... and civiche needs not a little .. but a lot more lime IMO."}
{"text":"Will never return to this restaurant. I had the same experience as a previous review so I guess this must happen a lot at this dump. The place first of all looks like a joke the only reason I ended up here was because my friend has a gift card to this place and wanted to go. Plus very limited parking infront so if there is no spaces open your screwed.  We got to the restaurant at 7:30-8pm on a Friday it was a group of 5, and we walked in to see 50% of the restaurant empty. We asked to get a table for 5 and before we even finished talking the waitress or host bluntly says NO. I've never been refused service anywhere. We asked why and she stated they were fully booked. Our entire group looks around and asked how if the place was empty, she stated that it was reserved for 8:30. She then tells us the next time we come in to call and hands us a card basically kicking us out the door. We threw the card on the ground and said we wont EVER be coming back to be treated this way. I understand waiting, or even being told a time when a table is opening up since people were eating which means one would have opened soon. No she simply refused our group. In today's world that disrespectful and wrong. Who reserves an entire restaurant, do you tell every walk in they cant eat there?  Ill stick to my good Mexican places, please hear my advice and stay FAR FAR away. Much better places out there with better location, service and food."}
{"text":"The decor and desserts were probably the only good 2 good things about this restuarant. Service was slow and the food had surprisingly little flavour for mexican food. I enjoy live music but not when it's so loud you can't hear the person next to you. I wasn't expecting to oay so much for bland tacos and fries. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Food is so bad and overpriced. Not authentic at all and frankly an embaracement to mexican food."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I had reservations for Saturday night at 10pm, May 5th which was also Cinco de Mayo. We knew because of that they would be extremely busy hence why we made reservations. We also booked a later time so the crowd/rush would hopefully die down a bit. Wrong! We got there at 9:45pm, 15 mins early and weren't even greeted until 20 mins later. We were then brought to the corner of the restaurants were we were seated and given menus. Half an hour of waiting and waiting with no one to come even say hello or bring us a glass of water we decided to go call the waitress who said she'd be right over... wrong again. People all night were complaining about slow service. There was a birthday party there who waited an hour and a half just for their drinks!!! When asked how many people were staffed, they told us 4 in the kitchen, 4 servers, and two bar tenders. Ummm hello, it's Cinco de Mayo and you had over 200 reservations for that night, shouldn't you have staffed it more appropriately? After waiting an hour with no service at all, we decide to get up and leave. Unfortunately, I never got to taste the food but due to the service, or lack of, I won't ever be returning..."}
{"text":"They get one star for the amazing ambiance.   Went with friends who recommended it and love it. They live nearby and have been a lot. We walked up and were pretty impressed. Its aesthetically beautiful. My husband and I were very excited. We love mexican food! We get inside, fantastic place, old house renovated.   The menu was expensive, but quality deserves that.   I ordered a vegetarian Quesadilla, large strawberry Margarita and we shared nachos with our friends.  I asked a few questions about the nachos before ordering. She thought I just wanted to know about them and did not bring them... our meals came and still no nachos, she giggled and said oops.  The margaritas were awful. The syrup they used made my throat burn. It tasted like medicine. For $16 I drank it, too expensive to waste.  Nachoes: Plain. Actually chip was pretty good. too much tomato, not much else. Not nicely presented. No sour cream. Really small portion for $15.  Quesadilla came with fries (WHAT MEXICAN PLACE HAS FRIES????) no beans in it. Literally dripping  oil. Was on a sheet typically found in fast food restaurants. it stuck to it so i ended up eating the paper a bit...... the fries were okay. It size was one fajita folded over... for $16....  Small portions, terrible quality, went home feeling sick to my stomach with a burning throat from the drink.  Also only a few tables and really loud live music. Table is huge and we couldnt hear people across from us.   Next time I will go to my favourite go to El Ricon on St clair... that is mexican !!"}
