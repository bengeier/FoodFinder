{"text":"I have been eating Thai food for almost 5 years and I just recently moved to Blainville from BC. I checked out this restaurant today and ordered Tom Kah Gai and Pad Thai for the evening.   When I asked for tom kha, the waitress went 'uh? ' and I had to point her to the menu where it says 'Tom Kha Gai' in order for her to click. And their Pad Thai only comes with tofu and shrimp or vegetable and chicken.  The Pad Thai I've had in other places usually have tofu in them no matter if it comes with chicken or shrimp. In order to get tofu and chicken, you have to pay extra above the already expensive $20 Pad Thai.   The food took around 20 minute to come and the restaurant was not even packed. The service was actually quite nice as the waitress are always constantly checking who needs any help or services.   When my food came, the tom kha didn't look visually pleasing as the vegetable were chopped in nail sized pieces and floating on top of the bowl; it looked like they were serving someone's chunks. The soup itself was a bit too sour and that sourness covered the coconut taste if it had any in the first place. They even replaced ginger with some other plant with the texture of baby bamboo. To my surprise, the chicken inside was unexpectedly tender and tasted great.   The rice noodles tasted quite nice but they weren't Pad Thai at all.  First of all, they don't put tamarind in the Pad Thai and instead they were a watery sauce on the side. And to desperatly capture the sweet and sour taste of the dish, I can taste the ketchup in the noodles. When chewing my food, I could feel the distinct texture and slight bitterness of the intentionally uncooked bean sprouts that covered the entire dish. They did however kept the noodles moist and chewy but that was the only aspect that resembles Pad Thai. The portion size was also very poor to justify the high price tag.   Overall, I was disappointed by this place. If you've had real Thai food before and are looking for authentic taste, avoid this restaurant.    TL;DR: - good service  - long wait time - inauthentic Thai food - do not recommend"}
{"text":"First time here on a Friday night after work. Place seemed crowded with little parking. Large selection but pricey. Its a small gutted out house which gets quite loud when full. Tables are close together. Réservation preferred, we got lucky. Waitress did know the menu. We had to point our selection. They charged extra for the rice or the noodles for our main plates. They served jasmin tea from a bag with luke warm water. Small portions but tasty.   Considering the price I was expecting larger portions, knowledgeable staff and authentic leaf tea. Probably because of the neighbourhood they can get away with overcharging. Unfortunately I will not be coming back."}

L'endroit est petit, pas beaucoup de places de parking, mais l'endroit est chaleureux. L'équipe est resté beaucoup plus tard que la fermeture et ne nous ont pas incité à quitter !"}
