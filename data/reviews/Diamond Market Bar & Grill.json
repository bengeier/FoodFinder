{"text":"Stopped by the Diamond Market Bar & Grill to kill some time before the big Sunday Night Steelers game.  I can only speak to the service as we did not eat here, that being said, the service was outstanding at the bar.  Fast and friendly, prices in line with any other bar.  I would recommend to anyone in the same situation!"}
{"text":"Stephanie the bartender makes a damn tasty Moscow Mule. Delicious wings and gravy fries! Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Good place to eat and have a pint or 3. Very courteous and friendly staff. The appetizers were fantastic. Our sandwiches were delayed, so they didn't charge us for them."}
{"text":"First time here but won't be last. Friendly staff, fair prices and the best fries I've had. Also had the steakhouse burger. Fantastic!"}
{"text":"\"The food was not good at all and was way overpriced for the quality of food we received. The waiter was friendly though. Very disappointing, would not recommend, and will not be going back\""}
{"text":"Relaxing casual atmosphere, outdoor seating in heart of market square. Great service from Todd, my waiter. Black diamond sirloin was juicy, mashed potatoes very tasty.  Chose to be unconventional and order one homemade pierogie for dessert, and Todd made it happen. Wow, hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Not a fan. Sent back the cole slaw, possible made last month & left out on the counter overnight(s) The pulled pork sandwich was over engineered. Im not enough of a foodie to recognize which spice was added but it really didn't belong.
Pulled pork...pork, rub & sauce...leave it alone!!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here while in town. Horrible food. Started with onion rings...why the \"balsamic reduction\" drizzled on them?? Why do the cooks in back think they can take such liberties?? The kids wouldn't even eat them. I ordered the BBQ pulled chicken. Just chicken pieces with barbecue sauce poured on top, on a bun. Tasteless. Asked what I could substitute the fries with- waitress gave me some choices- decided on cole slaw. Cole slaw was just shredded cabbage in vinegar- and when the bill came I was charged $3.25. The worst part about this place is they actually ask if u want your burger \"pink.\"  Seriously, don't they know you ALWAYS cook ground beef thoroughly due to the bacteria on the meat being \"ground\" or mixed into it?? I explained this to my son, who ordered a burger, and again, made it clear to the waitress. The burger was served and after a few bites, my son showed me the light pink meat. We just about got sick right at the table, let alone possibly becoming violently ill later from potential e coli poisoning! The waitress removed it from the bill, as well as the $3.25 charge for the cole slaw, and was apologetic. However, I do hope this place gets shut down before some innocent customer becomes seriously ill.

Added note to comment I received about the \"source\" of hamburger meat at this establishment being \"known,\" therefore ok to consume if cooked any other way than well...the interior of raw hamburger is almost ALWAYS contaminated with bacteria and is SAFEST if cooked well done. This holds especially true for the elderly, immuno-compromised & for children. The practice of asking a child how they want their burger cooked, as was the case with my son, is totally irresponsible & dangerous."}
{"text":"Good food and great selection of beers. We made it just before the end of happy hour and the waiter made sure to get our order in, in time for the specials. Great place to watch the game, have a few beers and eat."}
{"text":"Great food, fantastic beer menu, and a very knowledgable staff. By far my favorite place in market square!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place to grab a beer, but the burger I had was pretty bland. May have been my fault ordering the California Burger. The bean sprouts overpower the whole burger which makes the flavor go downhill.  If it weren't for the Pens game on and a nice grapefruit shandy, I'd be having a rough time. The fries were nothing special and most of the menu is pretty generic. Aside from the beer, another saving grace is the atmosphere. The bar is very open and has a nice breeze flowing through during the summer. Not a lot of parking in the area....also a bummer."}
{"text":"Prior to the show we decided to try Diamond Market based on the recent review in the Post-Gazette.  

We parked close by and entered through the enclosed patio (very nice).  The young man at the door was pleasant and hospitible, even though he hadn't shaved (this is a pet peeve of mine, as my wife will attest to).

The atmosphere is casual and warm.  I especially loved the light fixtures.  The manager was nice enough to direct us to the restaurant's designer and he WILL be getting a call.

Since we were going to the theater, we didn't want to eat too much so we decided to share some appetizers.  I ordered the \"Pittsburgh Made Potato and Feta Pierogies\" and my wife decided on the \"Engagement Grilled Cheese\" (their take on Engagement Chicken I guess).

Well, both dishes are (use your best Charlie Sheen impression here) WINNERS .  The pierogies were perfectly browned while still soft in the center.  They are garnished with olives, cabbage and onions.  Perfect.  I'll be back to order these again.

The grilled cheese was a meal in itself.  Creamy and flavorful.  Three types of cheeses including Cambozola which I know isn't cheap.  I use this for my steak sandwiches at home.  Kudo's to Diamond Market for intruducing Pittsburgher's to this wonderful cheese that is much better known in more food-centric cities.

We will return, but the question is...will we venture off the appetizer menu?!"}
{"text":"Decent taps, great atmosphere with the large open doors bringing outside indoors, and best of all, a really friendly staff team - Took our request to watch the draft on one of the many big screens AND let us use their iPhone charger :)"}
{"text":"Really great! The front looks unassuming, but there was a nice beer selection was good and the food was superb. I had the rigatoni bolognese and my friend had a portobello burger. Both were really good-the rigatoni especially was delicious for the price ($16). I've had many pasta dishes at up-scale downtown restaurants for a higher price that weren't as good (to be fair, the sauce was NOT a rag√∫, but the braised beef and cheese blend was delicious nonetheless). We also had onion rings which were quite good. Our waiter was attentive and pleasant as well. Def check it out!"}
{"text":"I was rushed the moment I got in the door. I ordered a BBQ Beef Brisket sandwich, which was good, but the fries which were skinny and crispy had potential, but were cold and overcooked. The waitress definitely wanted to be somewhere else, was not inviting environment, so will definitely shoot for another place next time in Pittsburgh, although the city as a whole is awesome!"}
{"text":"Patio seating  on a quite Thursday night. A group of 9. The pastrami Ruben sandwich I had was huge and plenty of food for $12 . Server was good but my water was not filled when it sat empty. I'm sure he would've had I asked. Not exactly a deal breaker but would've been nice. Overall pleasant experience."}
{"text":"We went there for a late lunch on a Saturday. The place was still busy but we were seated immediately. Our server was friendly and very attentive - we never waited for refills, etc. The food came out fairly quickly. The burger was excellent. The pork BBQ was just OK though the sauce was good. I'd recommend the burgers. The bill was very reasonable for the amount of food we ordered."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars, I would.  We walked in just after 11am on Memorial Day with a party of 4 adults and 1 child (high chair).  We wanted to sit outside and since all the tables were small squares (enough to seat 4 people) we asked if we could put two tables together; we were told rather rudely by the hostess that we could not do that.  We asked if we could have a larger table inside and was shut down quickly and rudely again.  We explained that there would be no room for the child in the high chair if we took a 4 top table and she said he could squeeze in on one of the sides.  We again tried nicely this time explaining they just opened and the restaurant was rather bare.  Again we received a rude NO.  We started to walk away and I decided to ask for a manager.  As I'm waiting, the hostess is talking with someone I assumed to be a server (since she was wearing an apron) and comes back to me and says, \"well, we can just take you inside.\" I stood my ground and said I would wait for the manager.  The manager came out and the hostess came back to stand near us and interject into the conversation.  I explained to the manager what had happened and as I was explaining the hostess jumped in telling me I had been giving her an attitude (as if that gives her the okay to rudely shut us down on our table request).  The manager didn't seem to concerned with his RUDE employee, but did tell me we could be seated at a booth (inside), which would give us more room; I told him we weren't given that option, but had previously asked if we could get a larger table inside.  In the end, I told him we would never be dining in this establishment and we left.  A very unpleasant experience was had by everyone in my party.  I hate how rude people can be these days and It's very upsetting that managers don't seem to be concerned with their employees attitudes towards customers."}
{"text":"Struggling to find the words......liked it, did not love it.  The menu has a nice variety...a little something for everyone.  Was there for lunch and it was packed!  We waited to be seated but were served quickly.  I had the turkey burger...wasn't bad but I was underwhelmed.  The vibe in this place is good.  Nice outdoor seating.  Perfect for a casual happy hour."}
{"text":"I was excited to try Diamond Market because I enjoy going to Market Square and was looking for another reason to go Downtown.  We went on a weeknight and it was surprisingly busy.  Almost every table was full and the restaurant had a mix of younger and older groups.  We were seated immediately at a table in the bar area and I ordered chili as an appetizer with a Flying Dog Raging Bitch and my girlfriend ordered a milkshake.  

I was served a beer in a pint glass and without realizing it was not the beer I ordered I started drinking it.  I told the server and he took it away and brought the original beer I asked for.  I would have preferred to keep both rather than throw away a good pint of beer but oh well.  The chili was so-so but I wouldn't get it again.  My girlfriend's milkshake, according to her, was \"great.\"  

She ordered the Knife and Forker ($9.95), pink.  Your temperature choices are limited to \"pink\" or \"no pink.\"  The Knife and Forker is a burger with chili and cheese on top.  I got the deviled eggs ($5.95) and the Engagement Grilled Cheese ($8.50).  

I tried the deviled eggs and they were terrible.  The dish wasn't just bland, it was actually bad.  I ate one bite and promptly had the server take it away as well as take it off our bill.  I thought deviled eggs were hard to mess up but apparently I was wrong.  

The grilled cheese has cheddar, gruyere, and cambazola in it, but all were hard by the time it came to our table.  It had obviously sat too long and the massive amount of cheese on it had hardened.  It wasn't entirely inedible but it was a chore to get through it all.  

My girlfriend was very happy with her burger.  I did not try it so I cannot comment. 

The service was good.  Our server was attentive and extremely responsive to our needs.  

I would much rather have competent food over good service though and therefore I will not be back."}
{"text":"Pretty standard Pub food. 

The staff was super friendly, but service was slow and chaotic. I think this is the type of place that benefits from being in such a busy area--there's such a big crowd downtown, it doesn't matter how disorganized the place is--they make money."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite places downtown, but my last two visits have been less than desirable. I decided to give it another chance after my last visit, which I did not review (rotten avocado on my $15 grilled chicken salad).

This time we waited 15 minutes for the server to visit the table. It seemed as if there was a bit of a miscommunication with who was supposed to be waiting on us. If it were busy, I would've been more understanding, but since the inside of the restaurant was nearly empty my patience was running thin.

I ordered the black bean burger, which is supposed to come on a brioche bun with guacamole. Instead I received a stale corn-dusted bun with a slight avocado smear. The burger was decent, but not up to the quality that I had previously been served ( this used to be my favorite veggie burger in the city). Also, a $1.50 upcharge for a \"salad\" that consisted of a small side of lettuce with balsamic seemed a bit steep.

I'll be dining elsewhere next time!"}
{"text":"Visiting Pittsburgh this week and the DMBG on Market Street seemed a good place to refuel for a couple of hours. Service was friendly and speedy and there was a good selection of local beers. Menu was typical for this type of bar and I settled on a steak. It arrived cooked as asked (medium rare) although the promised Cajun spicing was hard to detect. All in all a decent bar, with good atmosphere, good beer selection and pretty reasonable food."}
{"text":"Super salty mashed potatoes were horrible. Roast beef was sandwich type meat. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Delicious eggplant parmesan! Here for bike trip and found good reviews for restaurant.  Friendly staff and great food."}
{"text":"If you wanna watch a Steelers game go somewhere else, they won't put it on for you..instead your forced to watch the Cubs/Cardinals baseball game . Lifelong steelers fan couldn't wait to watch a game in Pittsburgh highly disappointed"}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking for something different in town - not too upscale, but not a burger and fry joint either. We decided on Diamond Market. We walked in and were greeted right away. We decided to sit at a table near the bar because my husband is a beer lover. 

The number of draft beers mesmerized him for at least 10 minutes. In the meantime, our server brought us some water and offered a few appetizer suggestions. We went with the potato and feta pierogies and deviled eggs. The pierogies were absolutely delicious and I'll take his word that the deviled eggs were tasty. 

For dinner, I went with the Mahi Tuna. I\"m pretty picky when it comes to fish, but this was perfect. My husband ordered the Liver and Onions - I know YUK!, but he LOVED it. I can't honestly remember going anywhere for dinner where they served liver and onions. 

We decided to save some room for dessert and ordered a Thin Mint hard shake. YUM!! I cant wait to go back in the summer to sit on the patio and have another!

Definitely going back for more sometime soon."}
{"text":"The best thing was the potatoes- just like my Grandma's - just a little lumpy so you know they're real! Mediteranean chicken was very good also. My husband didn't care much for his Simply Grilled chicken, kind if boring, but you get what you ask for."}
{"text":"My turkey burger was so good!!!! Oh and the sweet potato fries also are the best. I crave them but I'm 4 hours away. I may have to take the drive to get another one though!!!"}
{"text":"Had a half dozen co-workers go there for lunch today to wish someone luck on a new job.

The service was fast and friendly.

The food was good.  The winning dishes were the Steakhouse Burgers.  The lamb sliders were good, but a little bit dry.

This place is your typical downtown $10-$12 burger/sandwich place with slightly above average food and decent service.

I wouldn't go out of my way to go here, but I can't easily find fault with it either.

Ehhh.  4 Stars, but I can see why people might give it 3!"}
{"text":"I never heard of this restaurant and was excited to try something new.  The service was great and we didn't have to wait for a table.  

House Smoked Meatballs:  They are out of this world!!!  I could eat this dish for the rest of my life.   By far my favorite on the menu. 

Mediterranean Chicken Sandwich:  Fresh and very tasty.   The olive relish really makes the sandwich and such a refreshing spin on a typical chicken sandwich! 

Greek-style Lamb Sliders:   Fresh and delicious.  

French Fries:  Fresh cut!! (yes!!) they were good but a little over-salted.

I was very impressed with the service and food!  The only thing I didn't care for during my visit  was the location of the restrooms. It was very difficult to maneuver through the tables/chairs (including the servers) to reach the facilities.  Since the restrooms were to designed for 1 person use - there was really nowhere to wait - very small space.  

The food was outstanding I do intend on visiting again."}
{"text":"I happen to really enjoy this restaurant. It's right on the square which is beautiful for the warm weather. You can sit outside but it's even nice inside when they knee the doors open. 

The garlic parm wings are a must try. I've had them twice. Perfect both times. Tender and juicy and full of flavor. 

The first time I went I got the diamond burger with fries and it was to die for but of course to much to eat in one sitting! 
The second time I got the classic chicken sandwich because I was feeling boring but the chicken was perfectly cooked and delicious. I also substituted the vegetable of the day instead of fries to be a little healthier and it was amazingly prepared broccoli. 
My boyfriend got the cod sandwich and it was so big the waiter thought he didn't like it because he barely made a dent. He said it was delicious though. 

I recommend this restaurant highly to those trying to expand away from Primanti Bros."}
{"text":"Not accommadating.  I like the restaurant and the food, but lately I've noticed that trying to call in a order for take out has not been pleasant.  They don't accept take out orders on Friday and on several occasions I've called to pick up lunch and was told they were not taking any to-go orders.  Some of these lunches have been for a working lunch for our company.  We've decided not to use them anymore for any type of lunch orders."}
{"text":"Food was incredible !! very tasty , fresh , the presentation that our food was given to us was very pleasant as well. Service was quick and we were seated and brought drinks to us immediately. Will definitely come here again !"}
{"text":"Disappointed. 

The menu is heavy, very limited choices for small meals to soak up a few suds and enjoy watching a game. I settled for white bean/ham soup that was good, but unfulfilling. Why not compliment it with a slice of bread to soak up the savory liquid?! I will pay higher prices when worthwhile, but not willingly with my experience.

The wait staff was less than average. The bartender had to repeatedly remind staff to do their jobs, e.g., greet arriving customers, while they chit-chatted and watched the Steelers game, for one - note the tables were nearly empty. The temp outside was 49 degrees; staff repeatedly opened the front door to air the room, apparently, forcing me to put on my jacket - feeling uncomfortable. When the bartender beginning to talk about other workers,I chugged my beer and headed to the door. I wont be back the next time I visit the fun and small big city."}
{"text":"I was interested in an appetizer but wasn't in the mood for wings or heavily fried plates. I walked Market SQ., and reviewed several menus when I came upon the Diamond Market Bar & Grille. They have a meatball appetizer that fit my palette's bill so I ordered it. 

I was served 5 large meatballs in tomato sauce, with shredded parm and a dollop of greek yogurt on top. It was very good and not fried, yeah! 

The place has a good feel to it, very good service, and clean overall.

My 1st visit impression was very good and I recommend this spot."}
{"text":"Dinner around 7 on a Monday night was fairly crowded and loud. The atmosphere isn't the greatest, but it's clean and there are TVs with sports on to watch so it can serve as a fun night out with friends.

The burgers and fries are quite delicious; this is the place to go classic. The fries are so deliciously seasoned with just a hint of sweetness, and you get a ton of em.

The California burger is excellent - very juicy and smothered in healthy green sprouts and guacamole. It also comes with a side of green aioli of some sort. Highly recommend.

Overall, a good, classic grille with satisfactory food, though the prices seem a bit steep at about $11 a burger (with fries so I guess not too bad). Don't go if you're hoping for a quiet, peaceful atmosphere."}
{"text":"Even though I've been here before, Diamond Market never really struck me until I tried one of their burgers.  When I was there for the arts festival, my boyfriend and I went, and I had the California burger. He had just the regular cheese burger, since he has simple tastes. I asked my burger to be \"pink\" since my normal go to is medium rare.  This burger hit the spot. I think the prices are very reasonable for the quality of food.  I'm looking forward to trying more of their burgers soon!"}
{"text":"After spending some time walking around in downtown Pittsburgh, a few friends and I found ourselves in Market Square, and in a very hungry state. Seeing that our first choice of restaurant was closed, we decided to give Diamond Market Bar & Grill a chance despite the less than stellar reviews.

Upon entering the restaurant, I was first impressed at how clean the place was, and our server initially seemed very friendly and helpful. However, as the meal progressed, it became evident that she would only return to the table if you blatantly called for her across the restaurant, something that quickly became annoying.

The food here isn't cheap, but it isn't super expensive either. I think I got away with ordering a burger and fries for about $10-12. However, Diamond Market definitely does not have the best food you will ever taste. On the other hand, it isn't the worst either. It's just very, very, bland. On top of this, our server did not give my sisters order right, which I know happens, but we were the only people in the restaurant so its not like she was too busy to take the extra second and pay more attention.

When all is said and done, I would not personally return to Diamond Market, but I suppose it could do in a pinch."}
{"text":"Tourist trap. Deafening din, drunken patrons, disappointing food."}
{"text":"Very good food that is reasonably priced. Quality craft cocktail list and very good happy hour pricing. Sliders and the mac and cheese are standouts."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today. Loved the inside and enjoyed the loud and busy lunch crew. Great service and I loved that the turkey breast was real and not lunch meat like some others around town. Fries were fantastic. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Ordered the salmon salad. Despite being in the \"Big Salads\" category on the menu, it came as a salmon filet plated next to a small pile of wilted spinach. Two stars for the salmon tasting okay, and for the other salads in our group standing up to their \"Big Salad\" menu category."}
{"text":"Overpriced. Food was just ok.  8.95 for a small bowl of pasta with butter for my daughter. No kids menu."}
{"text":"Bartenders are not very friendly. You can tell other employees hang out there and that's who they talk to. They're short with other guests. They give the routine, \"what can I get for you?\" \"Have a good night.\" and that's about it. If I were managing this place, I would get some more outgoing and friendly people behind my bar who are going to get more guests wanting to come back. I stopped in this place every night for about a week straight hoping it would get better or I would get a friendlier bartender. My car is being worked on and it is near the bus stop. Unfortunately, it didn't happen. Tonight was the last time I'll go here. The man was just rude. Several times I tried to start a conversation and he ignored me. I thought maybe he didn't hear me but after the third time, I gave up. There was one other person at the bar this time. Maybe there would be more if you had someone with a personality behind it. Next time, I'll be sure to just go upstairs where the bartenders are friendly, funny, outgoing and looking to talk to their guests and make them want to return. On a good note, they have great draft beers!"}
{"text":"Initially, they didn't have what I wanted which was the Seafood Linguine. The waitress recommended the Eggplant stack, which was delicious! Love, love, loved it!

Their appetizers and entrees have a hidden spice which may or may not actual be written on their menus."}
{"text":"Had a couple of drinks with some friends here a few weeks ago.  The beer list was about average, the crowd alright, the service was a bit slow.  I had a plate of fries which were ok.  Overall, a pretty average bar with a bit of character that I probably wouldn't visit again unless a friend requested it."}
{"text":"My salad was phenomenal. I cannot remember the name but It had chicken, spinach and red peppers in it. I took half home for dinner. It was perfect! 

Also, our waitress was very nice! That is always a perk!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't reviewed Diamond Market yet! Diamond Market is located in a very prime location in Market Square. They offer both indoor dining and outdoor dining which is nice when the weather is warm. The menu is comprised of mostly burgers and sandwiches, which I'm a fan of their burgers and I love that they come with fresh cut fries. The food is typically served in baskets which gives a very casual feel. 

I'm not sure that the Diamond Market takes reservations, but maybe plan for a wait if you're coming during prime dining times (lunch/dinner) as there's always a full dining room."}
{"text":"To start with, our waitress took our appetizer order and by the time we had gotten it, she hadn't come back to take our entree order. I had to call over another waiter to take our order while she was talking to two other waiters in the front. 

The mussel appetizer was actually good, but the rest was disappointing. Angus steak was dry and burnt, no flavor even with gravy poured on top. The poutine had no flavor, had to add a lot of salt. My fries are cold. The liver and onions tasted of only vinegar. 

Our waitress also gave us the wrong check. I don't think she is paying attention to us. No  wonder the restaurant has been pretty empty this past hour while its competition appears busy."}
{"text":"I don't pass out 5 star reviews that easily, but these guys definitely earned it!!

Went here with visiting relatives, and from the second we walked in the door the staff was friendly, professional, and accommodating.  We had questions concerning the beer selection, and out waiter went out of his way to provide us with concise information.  Their beer selection isn't the same old tired beers you can get anywhere, but if tired, tried, and true is your thing ..... They got it!

The appetizers were freaking awesome!!  The bruschetta and the grilled cheese appetizers were at least.

I can't attest for the taste of everyone's meal but from the looks and sounds of it, everyone's fare was just as awesome as the turkey burger.  Replace the fries with their freshly made coleslaw and you have just a wonderful meal!!

Market Square is not the Market Square of yesteryear.  It's new face is refreshing, and places like the Diamond Market make it a place I will definitely frequent on. Regular basis.  They've officially just entered my Fab Five in Pittsburgh.

Do yourself a favor ..... Check this place out.  You won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Friendly service, welcoming atmosphere. A casual spot for lunch or happy hour. Appetizers are plentiful and delicious - try the pulled pork chips. Wide variety of drink selections and specials. Another strong option in Market Square."}
{"text":"This is one of those places where I've say in silence with multiple coworkers because we are all just enjoying what we are putting in our mouths and to speak would be to concentrate on something else. 

Diamond Market.. named for the Diamond (the former name for Market Square) and the market that used to be here, a long time ago... is a pretty solid place to grab lunch on a workday. The inside gets loud during the lunch rush, but I always enjoy the food... well almost always. 

My only complain is they are among those who have followed this new trend of asking \"pink or no pink\" when you order a burger. I always say \"Pink\" even though I like my burgers medium because I ordered \"no pink\" once and it came VERY well done. I cannot argue with the fact that there was \"no pink\" in the burger, so they were not wrong. Otherwise, I've never had a bad meal here. 

The burgers are juicy, and smothered with toppings. The menu has a good array of options without giving so many that one gets overwhelmed. In lent I often came here on Fridays with a Catholic co-worker and we fell in love with this huuuuuge fish sandwich they have on the menu. This is also a place where you can sit on the sidewalk in nice weather, and no one will give you guff for ordering a Miller Lite at lunch... on a workday. I know it's not a craft beer, I've go be productive. I can't nap and get stuff done. 

A couple of my coworkers also love the salads here. Wedges come with good toppings, and the meats on the salads have been raved about by my crew. 

Give it a go, and see for yourself!"}
{"text":"In the past week I've done both lunch and dinner at Diamond Market Bar & Grill, so now I feel ready to write about it.  On both ocassions the place was indeed busy and jam-packed with people, so if you don't enjoy loud-ish venues this is not the place for you during high traffic.

Both times I had burgers, during my lunch foray I had the BBQ Pulled pork burger which was delightful and prepared as requested.  For dinner I had the Deluxe (or was it Royal?, either way it had an egg in it) burger which was GREAT except for there was too much pink in the burger that I ordered with no pink.  The fries were great on both occasions and I'm a sucker for fries.

Based on my experiences, the quality of the food, the good prices and the decent drink selection (didn't go into it since no one ordered any) I can certainly see myself returning to this venue.  :-)"}
{"text":"Asked the bartender what was good to eat.... Was leaning toward pot roast and she agreed. It was great! The meat was tender and savory.. The mashed potatoes were just as good."}
{"text":"This place has a great happy hour! Half off all drinks (aka like $5 cocktails, $3 beers) and cheap apps (sliders-$2 each, fries-$3, bigger sides/plates,$5). I had a lamb slider, a Gin Juice cocktail, and a beer on draft and my bill came to $12 (including tip). 10/10 recommend this happy hour. The only annoying part was that while I was sitting outside a random guy came up to our table and was soliciting us to buy his makeup products. Other than that I thoroughly enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"Had lunch with girlfriends here yesterday and would be back for sure. Flatbread app was delicious, black bean burger was flavorful and my dirty martini was spot on... dry with some gorgonzola stuffed olives.  We sat outside and enjoyed the gorgeous weather while waiting for Light the Night festivities to begin. Great spot in Market Square"}
{"text":"First of all, we were sat at a booth and it took over 15 minutes before we were able to flag someone down. The manager came out to apologize for the wait. We were than able to place our order. Beer selection is good.

I ordered the Pittsburgh Platter while my wife had the Hot Beef and Cheddar sandwich. It came out hot and was very good. 

The manager comped the beef sandwich. In the end we were happy with dinner."}
{"text":"This is a classic Pittsburgh institution.  Generous portions of comfort food. Lively crowd and a 1930's vibe.  Awesome people watching on the square if you have a window high-top or sit outside."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite happy hours in Pittsburgh. On Thursday's and Fridays, their happy hour is from 3-7 and half off any drink you could possibly want. The food is your typical bar food, but the ambiance is nice with being able to site outside in market square."}
{"text":"No Bloody Mary Mix + plastic cups + grouchy bartender= 1 beer and gone.  Sorry my business imposed upon the staff.  Not worth my $$$"}
{"text":"My guest and I came in as we were walking through the Art Fair that was going on in the Market Square area.

We sat down here for a while because ever other place in the area was very busy. We got an order of Diamond Fries, which were very good, and were rocking through their awesome $3 craft beer deal that they had going on. We also split a flight too because it was also a really good deal. The server was cooperative enough to let us move outside too as the rain stopped and seats opened up. It was a very nice and relaxing experience and my guest and I were very happy that we stopped here."}
{"text":"We live around the corner from this place and haven't ever been there, so we thought why not? It was bad. 
An unfriendly hostess sat us, didn't even say hello honestly. I've worked in restaurants and bars for years so I get it sometimes you just aren't having a good day but ...
Our server came over pretty quick which was the only good thing about the experience. She was nice enough but obviously didn't think we'd tip well because she was way nicer and more attentive to the tables around us. 
We ordered BBQ pork chips for an app - came out in literally 30 seconds brought out by a food runner. He didn't care to notice we didn't have silverware, plates, or napkins. Set it down and walked away. Our beer was brought out and it was in plastic cups (really ... plastic cups like it was a carnival and not a $60 meal...) and our server noticed we had the app and still no napkins or silverware. You try eating BBQ pork chips without a fork or napkin. Not to mention the pork was all fatty. We ended up bringing it home and fed it to our dogs. It was nasty. 

Then, maybe 4 minutes after we got the app, the food came. I appreciate fast service like that usually because I am usually starving but the food came out and still the server didn't notice we had no utensils - which is just the biggest no. I wasn't going to eat my microwaved chicken Caesar salad with my fingers. 

The French fries on my boyfriends plate were the only edible part of the entire meal and not once did the server realize we hadn't touched literally any part of the food. 

And that warm beer, Bubbles by Rhinegeist, must've come from a dirty tap because I have the worst migraine you've ever imagined. I drink beer everywhere we go and I only had half of one, and I only get migraines from gross restaurants that don't properly care for their tap system. Makes me feel gross.

Save yourself the disaster and go to City Works or Harris Grill around the corner."}
{"text":"I like this place overall, but I find it depends on what I order. This is a nice spot for lunch in market square. While it is usually crowded, it is also pretty fast and they have outside seating. I typically get a sandwich with a side of salad. Yesterday ordered the brisket which comes on a nice bun. The brisket was really tender and had great flavor, and there was lots of it. Honestly as strange as it sounds their side salad is amazing, as is there balsamic dressing that its served with. Overall a good meal. I went with a friend who ordered the salmon salad. When it came out we were both surprised at how little there was to the salad piece of the meal. The salmon was served with a side of greens that looked kind of pitiful. Salad greens are inexpensive, don't skimp on them, especially when someone orders a salad! My side salad looked more plentiful than my friends meal salad and we both noticed that right away. 

Overall a good experience and would be back, my friend said she would likely just order something different next time."}
{"text":"I spend a lot of time seated at the bar and a great bar tender really means a lot to me. And I had a great bar tender. She  was kind enough to advise me to drink all my water and eat all my food, since I was drinking beers.  I thought that was kind and maternal.  The bartender gave me  a couple of samples of the beers they had on tap and was patient while I made my selection.

For lunch I ordered the steakhouse burger.  The Diamond Market serves their burgers two ways, pink or no pink.  I got the no pink. My burger had just about every thing on it, blue cheese,  bacon , lettuce and a tomato chutney and balsamic. I would have liked a little more blue cheese. 

I hardly ever eat burgers...so I really don't have much to compare my burger to...but for me the burger was yummy and well put together and was served with a pickle and fries.  I was also given just a tiny bit of slaw which was very yummy and even had jalapeno and red pepper in it that really stood out to me in a good way. 

I enjoyed my lone lunch at Diamond Market Bar and Grill....side bar I couldn't help  but think about when this location use to be a Jenny Lee's bakery."}
{"text":"I am fortunate enough to get to come to Pittsburgh often on business and was delighted to find this jewel of a place called the Diamond Market Bar and Grill!  I have eaten here a few times and love the fact that the place is so clean and the staff is so pleasant.  The food has been fantastic - I love the Mac and Cheese and the Bourbon steak sandwich and think these will be my \"regular\" order.  Among the attractive features are the outdoor patio tables, and I'm certain that the outstanding beer options help.  :)

The prices are reasonable, and it is nice to find an alternative to the \"regular\" eateries in Market Square - this is definitely my new favorite!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. It's not a chain restaurant and serves up some simple fare...which is a breath of fresh air - given the number of restaurant chains seemingly continuing to sneak in to the Market Square area. 

The place isn't big, by any means, but is lively and vibrant with a cozy bar area with plenty of spirits, should you be so inclined. 

As for the food, it's salads, sandwiches, burgers, and fries...with some good entrees sprinkled in the mix as well.  The fries are certainly worthy of a try...though they can be difficult to share because they're pretty, darn good. 

Good for lunch...good for dinner...this place is a good stop if you're in the downtown area looking for a place that could accommodate almost everyone's palate.  Good eats!"}
{"text":"Great location on market square.  It is a casual sports bar atmosphere but with great food.  I had the grilled chicken salad with spinach, apples and roasted red peppers.  Very fresh, very good.  The service was good but not too intrusive.   Sit outside if the weather permits. I'm not sure why the ratings aren't higher for this place.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Diamond Market is a small sports-ish diner with lots of TVs and black-and-white photos of the square filling every available wall space.  The service was casual and low-key.  

I didn't see a gluten-free bread option on the menu, so I went with a bowl of chili and their sweet potato fries.  The chili was more of a cup than a bowl size, which worked out perfectly.  It was just on the verge of being too salty, and with just enough jalape√±o kick to make it worth eating.  The sweet potato fries were a large portion and not your typical version, being quartered and sliced potatoes similar to a chip rather than the typical strip form.  They left the skin on, which I loved, and seemed more baked than anything.  The texture ranged from soft to chewy, depending on the size of the piece.  My only critique would be to actually add the seasoning listed on the menu.  I actually really liked them though...  

I'll come back here, for sure."}
{"text":"Such a great \"go to\" in Pittsburgh! So happy to have it here! Love to just grab a veggie burger and a beer!"}
{"text":"When they say no pink they should say burnt. Worst burger I've had. Burger was tough, fries are ok."}
{"text":"Picked up an order for takeout...
Ordered with the hostess who was unsure about the system, which was fine, someone helped her. Food came out pretty quick. Went to ask for some condiments where I hear one of the cooks remark, \"Tell her she's not hot enough,\" to another waitress. Asked for 2 mayos and 1 ranch. Got 1 mayo, 2 ranches. Got to the car to hand out food to the family so we could continue our road trip.
Deviled eggs: filling was good, white was suuuper rubbery. 
Burger: ordered burger with bacon and cheese. Came with no bacon.
Kids burgers: ordered plain. Had ketchup.
Grilled chicken sandwich: ordered plain, came plain. Was good. 
Fries: Would have been good if they had been cooked fresh and not sitting around for awhile. 
Mashed potatoes & gravy: no gravy. 

Food had potential to be good but the staff is clearly bringing this place down."}
{"text":"Food is good but a very small menu prices aren't too bad a lot of TVs good place to watch the game"}
{"text":"We were in Pittsburgh for a wedding and stumbled upon Diamond Market.  We were looking for a bar to have a quick drink.  The bartender, Jenna, greeted us and took our orders.  A man at the end of the bar was eating soup.  Being soup lovers, we asked the bartender about the soup.  The manager overheard our comments and offered us a sample.  The sample was delicious and we ordered a bowl.  The banter with the others at the bar was fun.  We could have stayed much longer, but had to leave for the wedding.  Our bill for 2 glasses if wine, two beers, and a bowl of crab bisque $20. with a tip. What a bargain!!!
On Saturday morning after going to two closed coffee shops, we went back to Diamond Market for breakfast.  Our server was Jenna, the bartender from the night before.  My husband ordered coffee.  I wanted a latte, but Diamond Market does not serve them.  Jenna recommended Nicholas Coffee shop, a partner of Diamond Market.  I was asked her if I could go get a latte.  Jenna insisted on going to get it for me...who does that?? What service!!  The food was,fantastic.  My husband had the chorizo breakfast burger and I had the Greek omelette.
We can hardly wait to return to Pittsburgh and Diamond Market.  It was a great experience."}
{"text":"I came here with co-workers for lunch a few weeks ago and I found it to be solidly middle of the road, no surprises sports bar & grille food.  I had a Reuben sandwich (a good barometer on which to judge a place like this), and a side of fries, and it was just fine.  For me, personally, it's difficult to blow me away as a sports bar, so an \"a-ok\" rating is where I tend to land.  I will say, though, that the service for a busy lunch crowd was great.  I just probably wouldn't seek this out or suggest it when deciding where to eat in the central business district, but I wouldn't turn it down either. A-ok."}
{"text":"Decent outdoor spot, and the beer list is nice, but the brisket sandwich was dry and over-sauced, and the bun was stale. French fries undercooked. Should probably send it back but honestly, they didn't seem to care. Tourist turnover is the focus here."}
{"text":"We stopped for a quick lunch before a Pirates game on a Sunday.  We stumbled upon this restaurant after feeling snubbed by a couple others (we had our 7 and 8 year old sons with us.  It was awesome!  I had the cod sandwich which was HUGE and delicious, my husband had the bacon BBQ burger and enjoyed it.  The boys had pancakes and onion rings (haha, my oldest loves them.). We were waited on quickly and all the staff was very friendly.  The fries are ahhhmazing!  If we're ever back in Pittsburgh, this is where we'll eat!"}
{"text":"Went here before a Pirates game, food was awesome!!!  I read some of the bad reviews before going and was a little hesitant, but in hindsight I am thrilled that I ignored them. Had an awesome burger (steakhouse) and with a group of four we all shared the \"engagement grilled cheese\" app perfectly fine with nobody struggling to steal food from others.  I strongly recommend this restaurant, but I do like \"bar food\" quite a bit, so it's perfect for me and maybe not for you depending your taste!  if you are looking for something a little more \"haute taute\" this isn't your place, but if ur looking for a place that is going to fill your belly and make you feel warm and fuzzy inside, then you gotta visit.  Oh, service was excellent, very very good!!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing server that answered questions and made the meal fun!  Loud atmosphere so be ready to shout.  Based on my personal experience I'd go back for sure and would stick with their more complex offerings.  Reason being is that the bar food my companions ordered was just ok...burger, pork, cold fries...that will only hit the spot if your half-in-the-bag already.  If you want to dine...go for their dinner offerings.  I had the simply grilled salmon and it was excellent.  Left off the chutney because I was told it was sweet, but, the horseradish mash were freakin' killer and the sauteed spinach was drowned in just the right amount of garlic/oil.  Never would have thought I'd get an awesome meal given the appearance.  Looks like a Dick's Resort but has minus the rude service and bad bar food.  Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"This place reminds me of Applebees / TGI Fridays too much.

I had a salad and my coworker had a sandwich.  The salad was alright.  The lettuce was good, but the overall mix seemed strange.  My coworker's sandwich was alright.  The fries were kind of greasy.

It's not a bad restaurant, but you've got so many other better options nearby."}
{"text":"This is a nice bar and restaurant in Pittsburgh's market square. They have both indoor and outdoor seating. Indoors you have the option of sitting at the bar or at the booths and tables inside.

Our bartender Stephanie was fantastic while we visited. She was courteous and helpful and provided us with not only a sampling of their drinks, but information for contacting some of the attractions around Pittsburgh.

While here we sampled their ginger collins, which was fantastic. Unfortunately, we didn't stay long enough to sample their other drinks, but their cocktail menu is impressive. While here we also sampled their bloody mary mix, which is well spiced for the bloody mary drinker.

They have an excellent selection of beers on tap and in bottles, including an excellent array of IPAs (bonus points since I am a lover of anything hoppy).

The bar and restaurant are clean and welcoming, based on our recent experience we will return again in the future!"}
{"text":"We went on a Friday night for dinner and the first thing I noticed is the noise! It gets really loud in there so if you're looking for a place where you can have a good conversation, this probably isn't it. It's a small place so when it's crowded, the noise can get kind of intense.

I had the roast beef and cheddar sandwich and it was pretty good! I had sweet potato fries as a side and they were a little sweeter than I expected. They tasted like they were seasoned with sugar/cinnamon. It was an unexpected flavor, but I didn't mind it.

We got the onion rings as an appetizer and they were huge! The batter tasted a lot like a funnel cake which was also an unexpected flavor, but it worked. The rings also had a drizzle of what I think was a balsamic glaze. 

The menu had a lot of good American dishes and I'd definitely come back again to try something else they offer."}
{"text":"I only recommend Diamond Market for their happy hour specials. Their food isn't good compared to what is offered within walking distance. It's only huge plus is outdoor seating when it's nice out."}
{"text":"Not a bad place for a quick meal. While wandering downtown the other night looking for a place to grab a light meal, my friends and I decided to try Diamond Market bar and Grill. The place doesn't look like much from the outside, or inside for that matter. There is a bar area and a restaurat area. There were several televisions that could be seen on both sides. The menu consistented of some typical bar type foods with a few stand outs. I decided to go with a bowl of their chicken dumpling soup to warm me up on a cold night while my husband went with the burger sliders with fries. The soup was excellent! I actually wish I had some of it right now. I could tell that it was home made by the chunks of white meat and some dark meat chicken. The dumplings were sooo soft and fluffy! I also had the opportunity to nibble on some of my husbands fries which were thin and crispy, just how i like 'em. He also thought his sliders were juicy which seems to be difficult for most places. All in all, worth a try if you are looking for a quick meal downtown."}
{"text":"I definitely enjoyed sitting outside in the square and my food was yummy! I ordered the open face roast beef sandwich! 
The service however, was terrible. We waited a very long time for our order to be taken and it took more than five minutes to bring back a few waters and they were not busy at all. Our server \"forgot\" to come back and let me know they had run out of the beer I ordered until another server overheard me ask my friend where my beer was.
Other than the service I would say it was a worthwhile place to visit and will return in the future."}
{"text":"Not my favorite Pittsburgh restaurant at all. But I do love there French fries. They are also quick and have good service when you are in a hurry and don't want fast food."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food! Ordered a cod sandwich, received enough fish for 2 sandwiches! Homemade French fries and chips were amazing. The onion ring appetizer was an entree in itself. My husband ordered an ultimate burger and proclaimed it the 'best burger' he'd ever had. Love the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Myself and the hubby went to Diamond Market for dinner tonight.  We've been here a couple of times and enjoyed it.  The usual Happy Hour folks were there and because the weather is so great, the outdoor seating was pretty packed.  However, there were plenty of tables available inside and we were sat in a booth right away.

The hubby ordered the steamed mussels and I ordered the fish sandwich with fries.  The mussels were perfectly steamed and the broth was a bit spicy and very flavorful.  The fish sandwich was flaky, hot, and had a wonderful crispy beer batter.  I love their fries.  They are shoestring fries with the perfect amount of salt.

Pros:
Nice location in Market Square
Prices are reasonable especially for downtown
Food is tasty and portions are sizable
Service is wonderful
Drinks are great

Cons:
Parking can be a hassle if you're not used to downtown parking

Ultimately, this is a great restaurant for good food and drinks.  It's quickly becoming one of our go-to spots."}
{"text":"This place getslost in the midst of all of the more trendy spots in Market Square but food was very good and service was very fast and super friendly.  I had the BBQ brisket which could have used a little less sauce but everything tasted great.  My son h the burger and loved.  One of the better mojitos I've had is some time as well."}
{"text":"Good little vintage diner serving American fair ranging from burger to salads to pierogis and more. Very clean, lots of tvs for the sports fan but not a sports bar. Service good. Food is reasonably priced: lunch for two about 30 bucks. Right in the heart of market square. Parking is tough if your not familiar with the area but very close to Port Authority rapid transit stop. Great location downtown. Close to the park."}
{"text":"Very disappointing.  I saw that there was something new and wanted to give it a try.  (I used to live in Pgh and am now visiting so I'm not sure how new it is)

I ordered the pulled chicken sandwich.  It was very dry and not very flavorful at all.  The fries that came with it were okay but nothing special.  It is very apparent that this place is capitalizing on the their location in Market Square.

We did however sit outside and had a great view of PPG Place and Market Square."}
{"text":"Cool place in market square, downtown Pittsburgh. Parking is tricky but we took the shuttle from the hotel. Place was packed even on the patio so we knew it must be good. We got right in with our table of two. Good selection of craft beers. Would have liked to see a description of them though because you can't always trust the name for choosing to your taste. We had a burger, perogies, and homemade beef veggie soup. Awesome taste and presentation. Service was good, our drinks never ran dry. They had TVs throughout. If you come to market square I would stop here."}
{"text":"Diamond grill has great food and large selection of craft beers. A must try is the pierogi and the open face beef sandwich with diamond fries was excellent."}
{"text":"Diamond Market Bar & Grill is ok. Not too bad if you're a fan of bar food. For bar style food Diamond Grill is better than most places I've eaten at. They seem to take a more simple dish and add their own twist on it, which I can appreciate. 
My husband and I split a couple dishes. The feta and potato peroigies. They were really good, came on top of saut√©ed sourkrout, with sour cream & chopped olives to dip in. 
The engagement grilled cheese with tomato pur√©e dip was a little bit greasy but still yummy. The tomato pur√©e was good, you could tell it was fresh. 
And also the grilled mahi mahi sandwich, which was not that great. It could of used a little more sauce, it was pretty bland. And the bun was about as basic & boring as you can get. They could've gotten a little more creative with the bun like using focaccia or brioche. It really would've added to the flavor of the sandwich. 
A plus in my book is they allow dogs if you're dining at their outside tables.
But overall not a huge fan of Diamond Grill, probably won't bother going back again."}
{"text":"My coworker and I found this place when we were walking by it and we were intrigued. The place is cozy and it has an outside and inside sitting. The day was really nice so we would have liked to sit outside but they were packed so we settled for the tables closest to the door. We were greeted shortly after sitting and the very friendly server went over a few items in the menu to get us started, which really helped out.

 I got the classic sliders with fries and it was really good. The sliders were perfectly seasoned and the menu mentioned that it has mustard, which I love, but the type of mustard it had was a little different and I was hesitant at first, but it definitely works!
My coworker got the Hand pulled pork sandwich and the sauce happened to be on the side, which was disappointing because it's not the same when it's not mixed in and it can be quite messy to try and do it yourself. But she said the flavor was there so that's good.

They have a good variety of items and the desserts sounded amazing, such as Flourless chocolate cake made with a Coconut and walnut crust with strawberry sauce and whipped cream. I will have to go back for dessert only."}
{"text":"I had to rate this establishment 1 star since there is no Zero star. Got greeted with lack of personality hostess. Got sat down. 10 minutes later went by...no server. I can't rate the place on anything else, since my wife and I got up and left. Guess next time we are in Pittsburg, we will definitely not visit this Zero Customer Service place."}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood place in Market Square .  A friend and I went for lunch, and I was pleasantly surprised by the menu.  Diamond Market looks sort of like it would be purveying nothing but chicken fingers and jalapeno poppers, but I had a great chicken spinach salad and there were enough other tasty-looking options to keep me coming back in the future."}
{"text":"\"A solid three for bar food.\"  Dana B.

It was a nice little spot, but I would consider it about average.  The meals were tasty, but not extraordinary.  I got the Mediterranean Chicken Sandwich.  It was an interesting twist on a chicken sandwich, but not spectacular.  We opened with the feta stuffed pierogies which were tasty.  I just didn't have anything to WOW me."}
{"text":"Nice place for a good lunch. The salmon salad was very well prepared and the service was on par. The place was pretty noisy and it can feel a bit packed, so it may not be the best place to have a conversation while eating or waiting for food. There are plenty of TVs places around the dining area so you can watch the game or simply people watch and take in whatever is going on out in market square."}
{"text":"My mom and I came here after wandering around for like 15 minutes and stumbling on Market Square. The outside looked like a warm, inviting bar with comfort food, so we decided to give it a try.
The service was excellent. Our waitress was very attentive and efficient, and we didn't have to wait long to order and be served.
I got the Diamond Burger, and it was great. The burger was very juicy, even though it was medium-well. The cheese/pepper/onions combination didn't overwhelm the burger, and the ratio between all of the ingredients was well defined. The fries weren't too greasy, and we're crispy and well-seasoned. It was a very filling and enjoyable meal for not too bad of a price."}
{"text":"I am writing specifically about their brunch.  

Not good.  The menu is thin, having only about 4-5 omelet options, a chorizo burger, and pancakes.  Oftentimes when a menu is small, one would expect the few items to be delicious.  Here, it was to the contrary.  

Specifically, I had the grilled cheese omelet.  I was skeptical but was told it was a fan favorite.  Perhaps I should have listened closer....there was no \"s\" on fan, so I suppose maybe only one person liked this.  Nevertheless, it was literally three types of cheese in an omelet...no tomatoes, spinach nothing.  Quite bland. 

Others at the table were equally unimpressed.  They had the chorizo burger, which is a sandiwched between two waffles, and a greek omelet.  In the end, we were all pretty unhappy.  While you may be attracted to the prices (pretty cheap) and the cheap mimosas ($3), it just was not that good.  For a few extra dollars, I will head to Meat and Potatoes next time. Or try another economical brunch spot, like Ten Penny."}
{"text":"This place wasn't so great. I know I won't be back and I think I can say the same for the people I was with. I ordered the California Burger with the sweet potato fries. It was o.k., nothing special. My b/f ordered a beef and cheddar and the diamond fries. He couldn't even pick the sandwich up because of how messy it was, he ended up eating the meat with a fork. The diamond fries were gross. Way overcooked, with no flavor and considering the small array of items they dress it up with, cilantro, parmesan and truffle oil, we expected it to be good. The server was loud and clear with us but apparently lacked listening skills. Not great..maybe better left to the after-work, beer drink in' crowd."}
{"text":"WARNING: A server at this restaurant fraudulently added an additional tip to my credit card after I left, and then they refused to let me speak to a manager when I returned in person two weeks later to confront them about the fact that one of their employees stole from one of their customers! 

My server's name was MICHAEL and I ate on 10/17/11.

The XXX burger is also not spicy whatsoever, and the burgers are overly seasoned and overcooked. The onion rings have way too much batter and are extremely greasy. The servers were rude, and had an attitude of indifference. I don't understand why this place does so much business. It's not the food, and definitely not the service.

Go to Winghart's Burger Bar across the square instead. They have GREAT staff, very friendly service, and a much better burger."}
{"text":"Bar atmosphere TVs & music. Staff are friendly. Menu looks fairly good. The view of Marker Square is great when the utility truck is jot parked out front.

I had the XXX burger, which has fresh cut jalape√±os, Habaneros & a spicy slaw. The burger was great. 3 PM on a Wednesday is the best time to show up. Otherwise be prepared for a crowd."}
{"text":"Yesterday while at the Warhol Museum with Bobby & a new friend we had met at church last month, all of our stomachs were speaking to us. I found out Wednesday was my friends bday, so we offered to take her to dinner. I pulled out my phone & trusty Yelp app to find a place on North Shore to indulge. No luck... Nothing really spoke out to me so I asked my friend for suggestions. She brought up Diamond Market & we all agreed. 

We ordered the mussels as an appetizer. My friend, Carlene, never tried mussels but really enjoyed them. 

For dinner I ordered the Barbecue burger.. burger, bbq sauce, pulled pork, cheddar cheese & onion straws. The sandwich was huge! Def a two hander. Also comes with fries.

Carlene ordered the ultimate market burger.. Burger, cajun fries, Cole slaw, cheese, fried egg & possibly onion? As stated on the menu, thing is piled high. 

 Bobby had the Mediterranean chicken. I don't really know what's on it but he enjoyed it :) all sandwiches come with fries.

Service was good but I think they took meatloaf off the menu. 

overall the meal was good & I'm glad to have experienced their burgers."}
{"text":"We were in town to watch a hockey tournament and we stopped in before a hockey game and had great service.  There is an excellent selection of craft beer on tap, good televisions for watching sports at the bar, and decent appetizers - we split an order of chili-cheese fries - quite tasty.  We tried to go back another night, but the kitchen closed at 10pm on a Saturday according to the sign on the door, so we picked another spot right on Market Square."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was crowded and poor. staff was appalled when we said we were going to switch to a table in the bar area from the bar itself. Ordered A bbq burger which came burnt and flavorless, they have an open kitchen and food saftey seemed non existent. No hair protection, gloves few and far between cooks wiping their faces adjusting hats(tree was one wearing a hat the rest had no hair protection) without changing gloves. Seriously reconsider before eating here."}
{"text":"I enjoyed Diamond Market, but had a sense it didn't know what kind of restaurant it was trying to be.  It has $30 entrees and truffle Mac and cheese, but also had pulled pork, burgers and typical pub food.

That being said, all of the food was tasty.  I had the veggie burger which was made in house.  Very tasty, but very messy.  If I were to order it again, I would get it without the bun and eat it with a fork and knife.  It came with fresh cut fries that were crisp and tasty. 

My biggest complaint was how close tables and seats were to each other.  Our chairs and the chairs of the people behind us were literally touching.
Would I try it again?  Probably.  But I won't be a regular."}
{"text":"I'm in Pittsburgh, looking for a lunch place and I was craving a fish sandwich so I thought what the hell. I like the atmosphere but the food was just okay. Fish was a little tasteless and fries were a bit too crunchy. I didn't hate it, but didn't love it. I enjoyed my beer though."}
{"text":"Save your money. The service was pretty good, but the food is overpriced and terrible to boot. Who ever is working the fryer needs some serious help. The food was over looked or undercooked. The $9 onion rings are just batter on top of a huge cut of onion. They were very undercooked and greasy. The fried fish was also soggy and undercooked, but the fries were cooked till there was no potato left in them. The beer selection is decent which is why the second star made its way on the ranking."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try and I have to say it was a real disappointment. We walked in after work, we were seated right away. The atmosphere was pretty nice, but there was a group on the other side of the room that was being very loud. And we were on the bar side and everyone at the bar was just fine. The doors and windows were all open and they had tables set up on the patio. The service was so slow. We waited forever to place our order and then forever to get our check. They did not seem like they were short on service so I'm not really sure what was going on to cause us such a long wait. 
I would have tolerated all of this if the food had been good, but it was not. One of the burgers was swimming in grease, it had no flavor, and the fries were soggy from grease too. The other burger was ok, but whatever toppings were on it were really sour. 
It seemed like this place just kind of threw stuff together without putting much thought into what they were doing."}
{"text":"I got the classic cheeseburger and it was really bland and dry. I had added bacon for an extra dollar and the bacon was crunchy, dry, and tasteless. 
The fries, though very salty, were delicious and were the best part of the meal. 
I tried some of my boyfriends beef brisket sandwich and it was delicious. 
Others in my party reported that their sandwiches or burgers were also dry and bland. 
The staff didn't seem to be very coordinated and we were seated in a sloped area so things were sliding down the table. 
I would have rather eaten at Five Guys!"}
{"text":"I stopped into Pittsburgh for a short time to visit family. Market square in downtown Pittsburgh is a great place for food and entertainment so I stopped after looking at their yelp page. I ordered the Steakhouse burger but the best part of the meal were the fresh cut sweet potato fries. At some places when you get sweet potato fries, you can tell when they came out of a bag. These fries were fresh cut from the potato so that was a very nice surprise. The burger was cooked a perfect medium well and the waitress was very attentive my sister and I. I will be returning to try the portabella and onion burger the next time I am in town."}
{"text":"Great spot right in the heart  of Pittsburgh's Market Square. I loved coming here inside or out.  Good food and a pretty awesome service, its a real casual spot. I loved walking to market square from South Side, and came here getting the Black Bean and California Burger multiple times. I think the is also delicious too. AND The fries are on point! Always a relaxed vibe in Market Sq., this restaurant is a very good place to hangout before a sporting event. 

Great taps, clean, nothing too expensive, and quality burger and fries. I would love to come back and eat lunch here again."}
{"text":"Not a huge fan and probably won't be going here for lunch anytime soon.  I came here with a friend and we both ordered burgers.  The burgers can be ordered \"Pink\" or \"No Pink\" - simple enough.  

She ordered the Steak Burger - Pink and I ordered the XXX Burger - No Pink.  We got our food quickly which was a plus.  But when we each bit into our burgers we noticed that they had switched our Pinknesses (is that even a word?!?!).  Mine was \"Pink\" and her's was \"No Pink\".  She was still able to enjoy hers to an extent, but I had to bite around mine until I got tired of eating the edges and told the waiter who can I mention didn't check up on us after taking our order.  

We saw everyone else's waiter much more.  Finally after flagging him down I let him know the issue and he apologized and told the kitchen to cook another one.  By this point, I was already fairly full, b/c the burger edges and the heaping amount of fries was more than enough to fill my tummy.  

I will say that the fries were very good - I'd probably rate them 4 stars.  So all pinkness aside, the actual taste of the XXX wasn't all that great.  It had jalapenos (fresh not pickled); pepper jack cheese, and this mango chutney.  So it's touted to be spicy, but I couldn't discern any real spiciness - the burger was just blah (even after it was cooked to \"no pink\").  I feel like the actual burger should have some flavor to it, not just the condiments.  Condiments should be there to enhance the flavor, not just mask a mediocre main attraction.  

So while I can forgive Diamond for switching our pinknesses - I can't get past the lackluster service and taste.  

Also random little pigeon was walking around in the restaurant - it was both amusing and disturbing."}
{"text":"My wife and I have gone here several times and have enjoyed the outdoor seating viewing over market Square. However this last time we had a male waiter that didn't really have a sense of urgency when business started to pick up and left us on unattended for over 20 minutes.  After asking for salt three times I had to ask the patrons next to me to borrow theirs. When the waiter finally came back outdoors he glanced over at me ignored me only to shake hands and give a hand shake and \"guy hug\" to a friend that was walking by and disappeared again for about another 20 minutes after we were finished when we were actually waiting for our check to leave."}
{"text":"I stopped by here a few Mondays ago for a snack with my girlfriend and two other dining companions after being in the city later in the night.   We were looking for a place to eat after we found out that Taste of Dahntahn was not open and remembered that this place was in Market Square.  The restaurant is pretty much divided evenly into two distinct parts even though there is no real divider between the two.  On one side is the bar with high top tables befitting it as well as some TV's and on the other side are booths and tables for your normal dining room atmosphere. 

 I can't say that I was too impressed with the menu whenever I sat down although I did enjoy the fact that they had an item called Pittsburgh Poutine since I am a sucker for it.  Unfortunately I did not think that poutine alone would fill me up and so I ended up going with the BBQ Angus burger which came topped with pulled pork, onion straws, cheddar cheese and BBQ sauce.  My choices for how the burger was to be cooked seemed odd to me as I could have \"pink or no pink\" and so I went with the no pink option.  The burger itself tasted pretty good as the combination of pulled pork, BBQ and cheddar created something that I really enjoyed.  My only complaint with it was how messy it was.  Now don't get me wrong, sometime I like a lot of toppings on my food just like the next guy, however I also like to be able to pick up my sandwich and eat it without my hands getting incredibly sticky.  It was also served with some fresh cut French fries which were pretty good.  My girlfriend ended up having the soup of the day which was some sort of chicken soup that I found to be somewhat uninspiring.

The bottom line for me is that I do not think that I would come back here for dinner in the future.  While my food was good, I don't think that anything was particularly special although I do see this place as somewhere that I could have a drink and an appetizer."}
{"text":"Burgers... There are really only two kinds. The first is a good burger. The juicy , meaty, patty that has the right bun, the right toppings, and the right sauce. Then there is everything else burger shaped, squashed between two sad buns. Diamond Market Bar and Grill makes a good burger. I have had better, but not many. I cannot honestly say a single bad thing about their food. The service was pretty fast, considering the number of people trying to get in, and the waiter I had was pretty darn cool. Prices were a little high in my opinion, but I am from a small town so I could be wrong. I would come back here again."}
{"text":"If you are pet friendly ( as the manager championed) this is the place for you. If however you prefer to sit on the patio without dog hair flowing from a another pet friendly customer into your drinks and bar bites you may wish to pick another venue.  Another couple had this beautiful golden. Each and every time some one walked by and petted the dog we enjoyed the flowing dog hair in our food. Upon bringing  this to the managers attention we were met with \"we are a dog friendly establishment.\"  We paid our tab tipped the waiter and left.  

 I suggested they sit the dog family down wind. I have a big dog. When they are over stimulated they shed.   Not going back"}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. Service was so-so, food was alright. Nothing stood out, but it wasn't the worst either. 

We ordered:
Ginger Collins- regular drink
Moscow Mule- nothing special either
Lamb sliders- the lamb was on the dry side
Cole slaw- not your traditional cole slaw. Instead of mayonnaise, they use a vinaigrette. I wasn't a fan of the soaked up, limp cabbage, it seemed as if they made it the day before. 

I did enjoy the outside seating."}
{"text":"I stopped her for dinner one night while I was in Pittsburgh for business. I was actually looking for a different restaurant but couldn't find it so I ended up here. The service was awesome. I was greeted and seated promptly. The server was great. She met my needs, but wasn't hovering. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich. The bottom bun was so soggy that I couldn't eat it like a sandwich. So I had to use a fork and knife. The paper on the bottom of the plate was so saturated I ended up cutting through it many time. The top of the bun was fine. I had the Sorbet for dessert, which was tasty and covered in whipped cream. So, the service would have gotten a 5 star, and food 2 or 3."}
{"text":"Cold soup because they \"forgot to plug it in.\" UPC label in my onions and cabbage. But my kid loved his grilled cheese. Nice waitress."}
{"text":"The food has always been very good here. I got a burger the other day from here and it was excellent."}
{"text":"We came in at about 6:30 pm tonight (Sunday). Party of 15 without reservations. The hostess setup tables and sat us in about 3 minutes. Our server (Lauren) was a rock star. Food came fast, drinks stayed full, she pre-bussed and boxed food to keep the table orderly. Mussels were good, onion rings were amazing. Hot beef was good, Diamond Burger was good, Mac n cheese was good. I highly recommend based on this experience!"}
{"text":"Diamond Market has been around forever, but in a downtown that's gaining more and more quality restaurants (and chains of relative quality), I haven't figured out why it's so busy, aside from location. I've only been a few times, but I've been reluctant to return ever since my first visit, tagging along with small groups of coworkers.

The service is usually pretty good and the food comes out quickly. They also have quite a bit of outdoor seating, but that can be a little awkward when you're sitting with a lean thanks to the sidewalk not being very level and the chairs that I don't have much faith in holding up, despite me being a lighter person. Prices are fair, and the selection is fine, but I walk away feeling unsatisfied every time I've gone. It's simply an average eatery that will likely leave you feeling like you could've spent your money nearby and had a much more enjoyable meal. Average all-around, unfortunately."}
{"text":"My last review was accurate. 17 bucks for a burger fries tea and tip is too high for lunch. They must expect convention people. Surprised how packed it was."}
{"text":"This isn't a must go to for out of towers. It is a solid bar and grill with a satisfactory menu good for work lunch and lunch with friends. Solid work lunch place. Nice location - Market Square."}
{"text":"Nice to see another option in Market Square. After dinner here with colleagues, I was pleased, but not bowled over. Among the things in the \"plus\" column: good range on the menu- something for everyone- a tasty beer list, and a small but cozy patio (with heat for those chilly nights). My dining companions and I were generally pleased with our fare. I had salmon with mashed potato and veggies; also on the table were barbecued brisket, the pork chop, and a burger. All were solid, although my potatoes were a tad dry. More dairy, please. 

In the \"minus\" column: sometimes scattered service (I asked a couple of times for a second beer- don't delay my beer consumption after a long workday, damnit), and some order confusion. My salmon initially came out with a side salad. Do I look like an Atkins follower? No, I look like the carb addict that I am. I need my mashers. The atmosphere inside is welcoming, but it seems to be suffering an identity crisis, as Rachel C. mentions. Sports bar? Pub? Dunno. This establishment is pretty new, so I'll cut them some slack. I hope they've ironed out their issues when I take my next business trip to Pittsburgh. I'm definitely willing to try it again."}
{"text":"The bbq house chips were amazing, even though the portion was huge for an appetizer. I had the Mediterranean chicken sandwich, which was good but standard for a Greek style sandwich.  The feta and tzatziki were bland, but the olives were good. Service was kind of slow and our server never offered to get us more drinks. Environment is cramped with little room between tables. I'd come back, but would request to be seated on the patio and would order a dish from the bbq sections"}
{"text":"Been here twice now after a bike ride to the Point. Good outdoor seat karma both times. One table available and we were all over that!

First time there earlier this season on one of those rare warm days in March or April, our server indicated my sangria order was the first one for the bartender  this season. For that, I think I got a more special one. This time, while it was good, it wasn't nearly as good as the other.

Ordered one of the specialty fries with herbs and cheese. Very satisfying to share with my husband."}
{"text":"This is a great spot to sit outside in market square and get a drink or two with friends. I have been here twice already this summer. It's great to come to after social events downtown in the summer. I have eaten here one time and the food was great too. I like that they have healthy options instead of fried food."}
{"text":"Would give it 3 1/2 if I could.  Stopped here for a late lunch after our Bike the Burgh Tour.  The food is typical bar food.  I had a ratatouille flatbread with chicken and my husband had a hamburger.  Burgers come either pink or not pink.  The fries were mediocre and the flat bread was ok.  Again, typical bar food.  Filling but nothing to rave about.  They do have outdoor seating which is nice.  I did observe one of the servers interacting with an older gentleman coming in for lunch.  It was very sweet.  He was hoping she would be serving him but her shift was over.  She ended up just sitting and talking with him even though she wasn't working.  Very sweet!"}
{"text":"Outstanding service: we were seated immediately and within a minute of requesting that the bar tune-in to a specific basketball game, the game was on the television in our direct sight; the food was served hot, and we received filled soft drink glasses before we finished the glasses before us.

The burgers we ordered were at the quality that I would expect at a chain restaurant. I had a mushroom and onion burger cooked to medium rare with a mustard sauce; the mustard sauce added an interesting flavor to the typical mushroom onion pairing. It was interesting, but if I were to order the burger again then I would probably order it without mustard as fair portion of mushrooms and onions were served on the burger. The burger was also served with a fair portion of french fries and a small cup of cole slaw; the cole slaw had peppers and an oil base instead of mayo which was another interesting twist.

If you appreciate good service, then the Diamond Market at Market Square may be your sort of establishment."}
{"text":"We were in Pittsburgh to see a Pirates game and stopped in the Diamond Market Bar & Grill as we walked through Market Square on the way to PNC Park. It was just what we wanted: local, interesting and inexpensive with regional flavors. Just as important, the waitress understood our hurry to get to the ballpark and expedited our orders. The pulled pork sandwich I selected was tasty and large. The atmosphere was fun. What more could we want?"}
{"text":"Top notch food, great selection of brews. I had the Diamond Burger and it was perfect. We sat at the bar and I was impressed by the friendly staff. My IPA was $7.50 (ouch) so only 4 stars."}
{"text":"This is one of the better places to go for lunch downtown. Not too cheap or casual, but not like Ruth's Chris or Capital Grill either. Most selections are between $10-13 which isn't bad. I would recommend going before 12:00 if you go for lunch because going between 12-1, seating is impossible. The place isn't that big to begin with, but they do have inside and outside seating and there are televisions that usually have hockey, golf or basketball on.

I usually always get the Steakhouse burger which is a mammoth burger that comes with bacon and blue cheese crubmles. Definetly one of the top 3 burgers I have ever had. The fries are delicious as well and they give you a ton. It is def woth the price. I also like the taste of their ranch dressing.

Service is average. The servers are usually in a hurry and are not the friendliest, but the food is usually cooked at a reasonable time.

Try this place out sometime."}
{"text":"Checked in, was told 20-30 minutes, the hostess offered us seating outside, we said ok. The server took our orders, I went inside and noticed everyone seated, I asked the hostess about this, she said, \"that's the was the cookie crumbles \". We left..."}
{"text":"I've been here many times, mostly for happy hour.  Their beer selection is good; however, NOLA right across market square is better.  The food is definitely good.  I enjoy the \"Engagement Grilled Cheese\" which comes with a side of tomato soup for dipping.  The black bean burger was great.  The only thing I'm not a fan of is the preparation of their sweet potato fries.  Personally, I'm a sucker for sweet potato fries, the thinly sliced, salty kind.  These are huge wedges with sugar on them.  Not appetizing at all.  Overall, I'd recommend you give this place a try.  I've alrways had great service."}
{"text":"Wonderful food! The wait staff is nice and attentive too. A terrific place that's not another chain restaurant like most of what's in the square. Don't miss the pot roast and mashed potatoes. I'm still dreaming about them. Management - consider bringing in some nice little dinner rolls."}
{"text":"First time eating here while in Pittsburgh, I sat outside on what was an absoultely beautiful day in Pittsburgh. They have great shade outside and there was a beautiful breeze blowing across the dining area to make it wonderful, even in business attire. I was seated promptly and waited on quickly even at the height of the lunch rush which often throws many other restaurants within this area for a loop. I had the classic American burger with fries. The food arrived really fast was prepared spot on medium still pink in the center. It had great flavor and the fries were to die for. I will return here for lunch again on a future trip."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere with nice music selection but the food was mediocre at best. I had a BBQ burger and a chocolate milkshake and both were let downs. The burger was dry and the amount of bbq sauce on it was quite unjustified considering the size... Not only did the milkshake overflow all over the table (which the server did not clean or refill), it also contained too much whipped cream and was a sad excuse for anything drinkable.

The server was cheerful and friendly and we got seating pretty easily... Probably because most people know not to come here :/

All-in-all quite disappointed with the food, especially for a place at such a prime location."}
{"text":"Stopped off here for \"one\" last round... As a kid living in Houghton Lake, Michigan I used to sit on the dock at sunset hoping for \"The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald\" to come on the radio. It took me places. So,  I open the drink menu and see \"The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald Porter\". As I'm Michigan bound I get a bit nostalgic.  The beer is outstanding. Great server. It's a beautiful night, I'm with a beautiful woman.  Life is good."}
{"text":"5 people at the bar, 5 waiters hangin out in kitchen area chatting it up. Finally bar tender waits on us. She was great. Obviously no manager on duty at 9pm on Wednesday."}
{"text":"The real story here is about the service. But first, we dined here on a beautiful summer evening. The patio seating was perfect for people watching and relaxed dining. The food was great. No complaints there. But did I mention the service?  Lauren waited on us, and when I left, I forgot my phone at the table. She chased me down 2 blocks away to return it to me. If you dine here, ask for her. Then give her an extra big tip as a way to reward the great service she seems to give to everyone."}
{"text":"I ate at the Diamond Market Bar & Grill, with my brother, after last Sunday's Pirates Game.  It was my first time eating at this restaurant but my brother said that I would absolutely love it.  He didn't steer me wrong.

We started with The Pierogies, which were crispy style with feta, cabbage, onions, and olive sour cream.  They were amazing!  I've tried a lot of pierogies around the city and these were by far my favorite I've ever had.

My main dish was The Diamond Burger which was topped with melted mozzarella curd, smothered with caramelized onions, roasted red peppers, and herb mix. With a truffle Worcestershire aioli.  It was easily one of the top 5 best burgers I've ever had in my life!!  It was amazing.

So why after eating some awesome food would I give this place a mediocre rating?  Because we had a super crappy/lazy waitress.  We planned to order drinks with our meal but she took the drink menu away as soon as we ordered.  She never asked if we wanted dessert.  She never came to refill our glasses and we ended up waiting around 10 minutes for her to pick up our bill while she stood at the bar watching TV.  (I posted a picture.)

Great food.  Lazy waitress. Can't say whether I'll return.

Update:  My photo of the waitress watching TV was removed by Yelp.  Bummer!"}
{"text":"Great service at the bar. Food was fair at best. A patron next to me ordered the turkey melt which looked amazing. Maybe next time."}
{"text":"Both my wife and I's burgers we had were great, had a great selection on tap and friendly service.  What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"How have I not reviewed this place when somehow I end up here a lot? Their barbecue pulled pork sandwiches don't come with enough barbecue sauce but I just ask for me and problem solved. I want no pieces of chicken to feel left out because that barbecue sauce is so good that I don't mind getting messy eating it. Also they have hand cut fries which is a bonus in my opinion. Another standout dish that is my go to is their salmon salad. That was actually the first thing I tried that made me come back. They also have one heck of a happy hour menu and it's affordable. One thing on my list is to try their brunch menu because last time I was there I noticed it and smiled at mimosas. This spot fits in perfectly with the other restaurants in the square. It may not be big in space or expensive in decor but it's big and expensive in flavor!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch on a recent Saturday. The hostess was very friendly. I sat in the bar area, because I was alone. My waiter was unattentive. The gluten free options are minimal. I ordered a side salad and a bowl of chili. The salad was definitely fresh. The chili was not special, pretty basic. The waiter didn't offer me choices of dressing. After he brought out the salad with a balsamic dressing on the side, I asked him for other options, which he accommodated. There are large TVs at the bar area, which are good for watching games, but the food is nothing special and the service needs to be improved. Unlikely to go here again."}
{"text":"This past Friday night, Kay didn't feel like cooking nor was she at all hungry, so I was given permission to dine out on my way home from work. In the wake of my offensive lunch at the gravely overrated Winghart's 2 months ago, I felt I had a duty to warm a seat inside Market Square's other burger joint, the under-heralded Diamond Market Bar & Grill. 

Self-described as \"a casual place that's neither uppity nor a dive,\" Winghart's shatters against DMB&G upon impact. 

My meal's only downside was in the Classic Deviled Eggs, which gets you a trio of bisected hardboiled eggs served with a yellow \"four-pepper sauce.\" The sauce, which kicked like an angry stallion, saved the eggs from complete mediocrity. The creamy, yolk-derived filling was scant and listless. The whites of the eggs themselves were akin to silicone rubber. 

DMB&G staff: Contact my mom; she makes better deviled eggs than I've had at any restaurant. Like many of her hallowed recipes, it is simple. Email me. I aim to help yinz. Seriously. Deviled eggs should be on more menus in Pittsburgh, and they absolutely rule when chilled, your deviled eggs' only other saving grace aside from the nice microsalad of pickled vegetables that accompanied them.

I mean, if you guys didn't make such an outstanding California Burger, and your cute, red-haired waitress by the name of Olga (trust me, she's a petite knockout) didn't do her job with such dexterity (they were insanely busy!) and succeed in charming the boots off of my feet, I wouldn't bother. 

That magnificently mushy beef cookie was on-the-target medium rare, oozing with meaty liquids that were absorbed adroitly by the bangin' Brioche bun. A spread of mashed avocado and chipotle-lime aioli furthered the decadence and pushed the burger towards the Mexican border while bean sprouts added a light, healthy, green-tinted 60's (Mr. Big reference), crispness to the body of the patty. Tomato, flawless shoestring french fries, a cold dill pickle, and a swell, creamy, crunchy cole slaw kept it in the realm of tradition. 

And speaking of tradition,as new as DMB&G is, it epitomizes \"classic\" to the point where one could fool a tourist into thinking that it has been fixture in this nook of Downtown for decades. 

A lively, gabby crowd that ranged from young professionals with loosened neckties to grizzled laborers with grime on their foreheads packed the dining room and bar so tightly that I almost went elsewhere assuming that I'd be unable get a table. Taking a chance, I entered the establishment. Fortuitously, a hostess happened upon a small table in a corner of the spirited room, one that appeared custom-made for dining alone and proved ideal for watching the jolly carnival of common folk that unfolded as I indulged in some fine grub. 

Even the bathrooms were tastefully retro and a joy to use. Pin-up girls illustrated by the late Alberto Vargas embellished the clean, white, tiled walls. I normally don't pay much mind to restrooms unless they're exceedingly rank, but DMB&G deserves a citation of excellence for their men's lavatory. The only omission was an attendant. 

With bags full of confections culled from stops at both Prantl's and Sinful Sweets beforehand, I had no reason to order dessert, even if the items on the menu sounded tempting. 

DMB&G doesn't try to be hip. Rather, it strives to impress with platters of good barfood and mugs full of class. Winghart's has been shot out of the sky with an aim as true as Pittsburgh itself. Pretension dies at Diamond Market's doormat.

P.S. I'm comin' back to try their barbecued ribs and those desserts of course."}
{"text":"Not very impressed.  The server station at the front door made it so busy and nowhere to stand coming in.   

The food was bland. The fries weren't  great.  They were shoestring.   

The waiter never came to the table.  We had to flag one down.  Finally a guy stopped just to get us drinks then nobody ever came back.  Had to again flag a waitress who finally got us a server.  Then towards the end the server seemed like he was pushing us out."}
{"text":"I wasn't crazy about trying this place but my family heard great things about it and wanted to try it. Granted, it was the weekend before Christmas but it was a mad house. The actual building is hidden behind a heated gazebo that is utilized in the winter months for additional seating, which is where we were seated. I was turned off immediately due to the lack of response at the server/check in station. The serving station is set up so that the servers' backs are faced to you. We didn't know who we were to check in with and when my mom attempted to, she was ignored numerous times. The hostess later asked us how many and although it was extremely busy, we were seated right away, which was a plus. The place was just entirely too tight for my liking, both indoors and outdoors. There is one bathroom for men and one for women, but there was a line within minutes because the space is so cramped and small. The gazebo area is really mediocre at best. There is a draft that comes up through the bottom of the tent, so my feet and legs were freezing and my upper half was hot due to the overhead heaters. The chairs are cheap flimsy metal and are not comfortable in the least bit. The business could at least invest in some better outdoor furniture if they are seating you out in the gazebo area. So, now that I've got the ambiance down, or lack there of that is, now onto the food. I ordered the Mediterranean Chicken Sandwich ($10.95), which had a mixture of feta, tzatziki sauce, and olive relish. It was a little bland considering the flavors that drew me in to order it. I ordered a side of the coleslaw, which had vinaigrette and apples in it. Once again, nothing extraordinary. What I really did enjoy was the \"Engagement Grilled Cheese\" ($9.95). The tomato puree was really good to dip the grilled cheese in, and was a somewhat unique appetizer with a creative flare to the typical grilled cheese sandwich. Our server was great, he made up for the lack of service we received initially. Overall, I would try this place again at a less busy time of the year, but I'm not ecstatic to go back."}
{"text":"I came here with family to check out the menu for a family reunion that we will be hosting next year. The food was good. I ordered the steakhouse burger. It was seasoned just right and the bacon and blue cheese and sauce that came on it was a perfect combination. The fries were good too. My mother ordered a side of brussel sprouts which we excellent and the sweet potatoes fries were awesome. They were a steak fry cut and had a great flavor. Only thing is we can't pick this venue because they don't accommodate large parties."}
{"text":"Somewhere between a diner and a bar, this local spot had some great menu options and a pretty good happy hour. I got the shredded bbq chicken sandwich and the market fries are amaaaaaaaazing. We went in for an early dinner and while it was busy, we had no wait."}
{"text":"Diamond is located on Market Square in downtown Pittsburgh. It's a very nice area albeit too many pigeons lol. Good amount of outdoor seating. The food is very good; I had the Mango Salmon, which is why I rated them \"spendy\", although there are plenty of less pricey options making it affordable. They also have a great draft selection, including a personal favorite \"Franziskaner Hefeweizen\". Two people in my party had the big cod sandwich; it was huge and according to them tasty."}
{"text":"I love Market Square - and I love to see smaller, more intimate restaurants downtown. Diamond isn't tiny, per se, but it definitely has more of a diner feel inside and a cafe feel for the outside seating (which is also available in the winter, closed in and heated). I also liked the sports / local feel to everything, with TVs everywhere and historic photos of Market Square on display.

Between our large group, we tried the BBQ potato chips - yum! - burgers, salads, sandwiches, and sliders. Everyone enjoyed their meals - and we left full and happy. Service was very quick, which is great if you're downtown for the theater or a sporting event. Also, our bill was very reasonable for a large group."}
{"text":"Service was fast and friendly, the outdoor seating gives you a good view of the square. I had the Bigrrr Burger which involved two angus beef patties, bacon, cheese, and onion ring, and some classic fixin's. It was HUGE, which while i expected from the description it still startled me. They skewer it with a steak knife so you can make the beast tameable by cutting it in half. The first couple bites were delicious, but not even halfway through the whole thing was an uneatable grease pile. My sister loved her California burger though.

Seems like a good destination for beers and bar food if you're in the neighborhood. Avoid anything fried on your burger though."}
{"text":"I have to agree with the other reviewer....a disappointment.  I ordered the Colossal Fried Cod.  This was probably the worst fish sandwich I've ever had.  It was all batter and no fish.  (So much for colossal.)  I tried peeling off the batter to get to the fish but couldn't eat it because the fish had wet batter on it and it tasted gritty and gross.  Fries were okay but not great.  My daughter had the grilled chicken sandwich and it was dry with not much flavor.  I don't eat red meat so I don't know how the burgers are but to be fair, my husband always orders the California burger and seems happy with them so maybe that is the way to go with this place.  We have been here a few times and I always leave feeling the same way.  Our server was nice but she did nothing when I told her about my meal.  That is why I am writing this review.   It's a shame because it is in such a nice location."}
{"text":"Stopped for a drink and a quick snack during our stay in Pittsburgh. Service is very friendly at the bar and food was pretty good."}
{"text":"After an evening of great entertainment with the Capitol Steps at the Byham, we needed to find dinner, and were getting a little bored with some of our regular haunts. Our number one choice was closed for renovations, so instead of revisiting our usual Mexican or Indian friends downtown, we decided to try something we'd not tried, and opted for the Diamond Market. We should have stuck with Hola or Namaste instead of 'hah yinz doin?'

We went in, and there was a very light crowd, but all eyes were glued to the six big screen TVs blasting 'em Stillers ad-nauseum.  Apparently, this included the few wait staff on hand. They seated us, and after ten to fifteen minutes glancing over the menu, and having made up our minds, with no visit at all from a wait person, I decided to make a phone call. I called the number listed for the restaurant on the bottom of the menu, and the hostess, who had been standing and chatting with one of the waitresses by the front door, answered the phone.

\"Good evening, Diamond Market, can I help you?\"

I replied: \"Yes, hi...we're seated here at the back corner table, and were wondering if we might be able to order a waitress?\"

The hostess looked in our direction, and I waved and she waved back and said \"Oh my god! I'm sorry! One moment!\"

So our waitress appeared within a minute, and we placed our order. Two brewed iced teas (they're Pepsi people, dammit), a 'Colossal' Fish Sandwich with fries for me and an Open Faced Meatloaf sandwich with mashed potatoes for my friend.

The menu we'd looked over was a little on the outrageously priced side. Many of the dishes, regardless of how commonplace and 'diner' they seemed, easily ranged between $15 and $30. For our choices, from the 'sandwich' category, mine was actually the cheapest item on the menu at $9+, and the open faced meatloaf was somewhere between $12 and $15. 

The meal actually arrived very quickly, and our waitress was as sweet and attentive as could be...once the call had been made.

First, the meatloaf. One piece of average sized white bread, with what looked like two strips of meatloaf, doused with gravy, and on the other side of the plate, an average scoop of mashed potatoes with brown gravy. Looked like standard diner fare, priced like bistroid art projects on a plate. I took a nibble of the meatloaf on my friend's cue, and it was...well...meatloaf. Decent meatloaf, but...meatloaf. And not very much of it.

Now, on to the fish. 'Colossal'? Um, not quite. 

Let me give Pittsburghers a quick lesson on fish and fish sandwiches. Fish, the actual creatures, are long and thin. Contrary to the standard possibly set by Mcdonald's, they are NOT the shape of the average hamburger bun, and they are not little squares. One thing I have noticed from several famous-fish-boasting eateries in da burgh is that it seems common practice to take an entire fish, normal size, and ram it all onto...a hamburger bun.  And this seems very odd to me in the land of 'hoagies', which are stuffed into buns that are fit for...a fish.

However, my 'Colossal' ten-buck fish sandwich came on...a hamburger bun...and it fit perfectly. The fish WAS tasty, as was the batter, and the toppings that came with it (lettuce, tomato, cheese, tartar sauce and banana peppers), but when you're two doors down from the Original Oyster House, with monster fish, don't you feel just a little silly bragging about your 'colossal' fish that...isn't? There wasn't even a fish 'overhang' protrusion from the bun. It was just plain ol' hamburger bun sized.

The fries were actually pretty good, crispy and real, and there was also a pickle and a tiny cup of cole slaw. The slaw was weird though. Frankly, it tasted like cabbage sitting in apple juice. Not cider vinegar, but actual apple juice.

The brewed tea from Nicholas was good.

But truly, meatloaf and a fish sandwich were just that, average and not hefty in portion, and the bill was $30. 

This was another experiment that failed, and another FTLT visit. We'll stick with the Mexican's upstairs, or walk fewer blocks and stick to Indian Spices...at least until Winghart's finishes their renovations.

And if you do decide to visit, and you sit there forever - the phone number for the restaurant is at the very bottom of the back page of the menu - just pull out your cell and order a waitress."}
{"text":"I ordered a BBQ pulled chicken sandwich and it arrived very very quickly.  At first I was psyched for such fast service but then realized my food had been premade and sitting on a hot line.  The bottom bun was so soggy that I was unable to pick it up so I had to improvise.  They take pulled chicken and squirt a line of BBQ sauce on top and call it BBQ chicken.   That's like taking a slice of banana and putting it on a piece of toast and calling it banana bread."}
{"text":"Price are good my bbq loaded chips were amazing.  Got a blackened fish sandwich and fries but they were just ok wouldn't order that again.  Service could of been better but they were really busy.  I'd give it another chance."}
{"text":"Interesting and varied menu with a large selection of beers on tap. I recommend trying the bourbon skirt steak sandwich. The apple pie milkshake is also a must try item."}
{"text":"My daughter and I had a wonderful lunch today!  Service was great, timing of food was spot on (even though it was the height of the lunch rush) and the place was very clean.

The reason for a non 5 star review was the fact that for a tea bag and honey to add to my initial tea and subsequent refill of both cost $7.00.

$2.50 for initial drink, no problem.  But charging for additional tea bag and $1.00 charge for honey both times seems greedy.

Service was great though next time, I guess I will drink just water.  Lol"}
{"text":"My review based on my visit in November 2016. I was in town for the Legendary Haunt Tour 2016. I was on a mission to find a place for lunch one day. I walked the general area looking for the best food option around. I scanned through Yelp to make my final decision. I decided to try Diamond Market. 

It was nice outside, so I asked to be seated outside on the patio area. I was alone when dining, so I was easy. My server greeted me promptly and took my order. I went with the Cheese Steak and Pittsburgh Poutine. The meal was at a reasonable cost. 

The food came out in an efficient matter of time. The cheese steak had a lot of warm drizzling cheddar cheese sauce every where. It was so good. The Poutine was ok, but not terrible. Check out my photo to see what my meal. It was great overall in flavor, tender, seasoned well, and was enough for lunch. 

I would have left a higher rating but the service was awful for me. My server started out great, but he just disappeared after he gave me my food. I didn't get a refill on my water and I had to wait for him to return with the check. Sadly and for some strange reason, he never came back. I ended up with another waitress. I hate to judge and make a false statement, so I won't. I just hope he wasn't offended by my lifestyle choice because he looked uncomfortable towards me in the beginning. 

Besides all that, I would recommend coming here for a nice warm meal. The cheese steak was very tasty. I would pass on the Poutine sadly."}
{"text":"I probably would go 4.5 stars, but my seven year old son gave it the bump to 5 stars.  I had the pierogies which were absolutely delicious. They were small as a meal, but were well worth it on taste.  

My wife had the colossal fish sandwich which was a diamond in itself.  

My kids had chicken and fries from the kids menu.  

Overall, an extensive menu, quality food, great location.  Im glad I gave it a go during the Holiday Season."}
{"text":"Delicious Mahi Mahi, but all the dinner specials are around $20 or more. Also the raspberry iced tea is good."}
{"text":"I had the blackened mahi sandwich, there was an upcharge of like $2 for the salad instead of fries, so I went with the slaw instead, but I soon found out that the sandwich already came with slaw on the side so I had an excesive amount of slaw to deal with. The sandwich was good and the slaw was average. it was very loud inside but not from patrons, it was the kitchen staff . Our table had a bit of a tacky film on it, which grossed me out. Our waitress wasn't very good, Olga or something was her name. She didn't tell of any food specials or that there were seasonal drafts on tap. We only happened to find out from another customer. When we asked her what beers were on tap she said  \"It's on the card\" when in reality none of the 10 or so seasonals were on the card...sigh she must not be working for tips or the alcohol sales. There was nothing at diamond market that made me want to go back again."}
{"text":"Best pork BBQ ever!!!!' The portobello mushroom burger was also delicious! I am so pleased we stopped. The restaurant is clean, service excellent and food is fantastic."}
{"text":"Another Market Square spot that's always hopping with professionals and tourists alike. It's a go to spot for myself and coworkers. Kind of a sports bar vibe but that's ok because it's a nice place. I order the same thing every time-Engagement Grilled Cheese...OMG delish!! I also always order the Diamond Chopped Salad. It's huge and super fresh. Friendly and outgoing staff too."}
{"text":"This is a good restaurant in Marketsquare Pittsburgh. Nothing is too over the top about this establishment but if you are looking for good food, this is a great choice. 

There may be some more higher end restaurants to choose from in this area but if you're looking for some bang for your buck, this is a great selection.

The engagement grilled cheese is popular and it did not disappoint. My burger was very well prepared. Overall, I would certainly dine at this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Love the food here! I always have the home style hot open turkey sandwich! It is absolutely delicious! The mashed potatoes are super creamy and yummy! The second time at the restaurant, our waitress wasn't very attentive nor present when taking our order. My friend is gluten free and specifically asked for no bun with her burger and the waitress didn't really understand. When the food came, the burger still had a bun and the waitress still was confused. Other than that, I love this place!"}
{"text":"3 dollar mimosas and super kind and helpful staff! Would definitely come back! Everyone was so nice"}
{"text":"This a fun, old school Pittsburgh eatery that serves comfort food and good times! It overlooks a very active square full of other restaurants and bars so there is plenty of people watching to be had... They also have a hot, young waitress policy so be sure to wear your sunglasses if you bring the missus! I loved the pictures of yesteryear Pittsburgh throughout the restaurant and you can really see how far this wonderful city has come. I recommend the butter wings which were absolutely mouthwatering and delicious and of course, the milkshakes were to die for... I have to grudgingly take a star as the fries were not only cold, but congealed in their grease like a mummy in its sarcophagous. Archaelogists in the future will find these fries fully intact and will carbon date them like they do dinsosaur DNA found in amber. But this takes nothing away from this gem of a restaurant which I highly recommend to other out-of-towners!!!"}
{"text":"It's so exciting to see another locally owned addition to Market Square!  

I thought it was going to be bigger when I started watching the place being remodeled, but I'd say it's a mid size place.  Not as small as Winghart's but not nearly as big as NOLA.  The atmosphere is very all American.  Lots of TV's for sports (Stillerz of course) and old pics of Market Square adorning the walls.  It's like it almost wants to be an English pub but wants to lean towards a sports bar with all the TV's.  

Everything on the menu looked good and I was going to go for the healthy salad option, but thought I'd be cheating myself by not trying something else tasty on the menu!  So I opted for the portobello burger.  At first I thought this was a veggie option, since some places call them a \"burger\" but it's really a big porto cap in the middle of a bun.  Maybe I should also read the description before I order, oh well, I got excited!  

This was a very large cap over a burger in a bun.  Toss in some melted swiss cheese and canalized onions and there you go!  The only thing that disappointed me was that I asked for it a bit of pink and it came completely cooked, so the burger itself didn't have much taste.  The porto was seasoned and marinated very well and I loved the carm onions.  The fries were skinny, not necessarily shoe string (which I hate), and ended up being really crisp and seasoned well.  The slaw, not a winner.  I'm a harsh judge of slaw and this just didn't hold up.  If you're gonna be a vinegar slaw, I want to taste it, and I didn't really.

I have a lot of  hope I'll have a really awesome meal here at some point.  I kinda want to come back to order a dinner option or come for their Happy Hour (the REAL test to a great bar/restaurant).  HH specials were advertised, and I like a special, so I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Came to the Diamond Market for lunch. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich. Hands down, it was the worst pulled pork I've had at a restaurant. It was tasteless and came out with so much liquid that the bun was soggy and inedible. I have no doubt that the pork was simply thrown into the restaurant version of a crock pot, doused with cumin and a couple other spices, filled with water and cooked for half a day or so.  Contrast that with good pulled pork, which is meticulously smoked in a smoker for many hours. This pork is actually similar to a Pioneer Woman recipe I use at home, minus the complex taste and good flavor.  It did come in a generous portion size, which is irrelevant given the above."}
{"text":"Diamond Market was a nice little surprise right in the middle of Market Square. It was really crowded but the set-up of the place made it seem cozy. 

The staff was fast and friendly. The menu was a nice mixture of bar food and some slightly higher end stuff. It all seemed very appetizing.

I went with a burger..the XXX..because I can't pass up trying out a restaurants idea of a \"hot\" burger. This one was unique. It had a fair amount of heat to it but it was also cooled down a bit by the mango-habanero sauce they put on it. It was an interesting combination of hot and sweet that made me take note. Might not consider it one of my favorite burgers but it was unique and different and I really appreciated that.

I would definitely try this place again if hanging around the downtown area. I would want to probably try something different on the menu but I could see myself getting sucked in to ordering the XXX again to experience that unique flavor combination."}
{"text":"We used the No Wait app and went right into the seating area, avoiding a fifteen minute wait due to the Arts Festival.  The servicer was fast and helpful.  The fish sandwich and the fish sliders were excellent.  We also had a chopped sirloin sandwich, which was served open face,  it was tasty.  The roasted brussel sprouts were great.  we will go back.  I recommend this restaurant.  The manager visited us and explained how they are able to handle crowds so well."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to the bar a couple times for happy hour with great service but we stopped by for lunch today and sat outside for 15 minutes without even being greeted and decided to leave."}
{"text":"Friendly, upbeat atmosphere and comfortable as all hell with the open air.  Not to mention, Jen is simply the best."}
{"text":"Outdoor patio is really nice. Overhead heaters are a nice touch. Pricing not bad, a lil more expensive given the items on the menu but good. Friendly staff, tasty food, & really awesome shakes!! :-) :-) Definitely a place to go when you wanna get out. Did I mention that their mojitos are bomb?! :-)"}
{"text":"The Pittsburgh Poutine fries are fabulous (coming from a French fry and cheese lover), but you also can't go wrong with their regular or sweet potato fries. I've been here a few times and the lamb sliders and the open face roast beef sandwich are my favorites. 
I asked the Husband what he thought, and his response was \"Yum\"."}
{"text":"I really like the location and our waiter was GREAT! This place is located in market square. They have free parking on Sunday which are very helpful."}
{"text":"Food was decent and reasonably priced. Husband had the barbecue burger and he said he couldnt really taste the burger it was so much BBQ. I had the pot roast. It was good. Service was ok. Food was delivered fast but Waitress came back almost too often. Then she brought us our check without asking if we wanted anything else. We wanted dessert. She took the check and brought us dessert and a few seconds later brought us an updated check. I wanted coffee but since we had  the newly update check, didn't feel like dealing with it. There's a common saying from wait staff \"can I get you anything else ?\" \" would you like to look at our dessert menu\", which gives the guest the opportunity to let you know if they are done and ready for  the check. She should try that sometime."}
