{"text":"A Westmount classic. 
Grilled cheese, milkshakes, Greek salads. 
Still a great place for a comfortable meal in Westmount."}
{"text":"Decor here is a little tired and boring. I liked the cozy atmosphere though. It is well located. I liked the food it was nothing incredible but good. I would go again if I happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"This place is garbage. It is not only over priced, but they use cheap, low quality ingredients. Canned food is never acceptable for me when I dine out. I had the tuna melt sandwich and it was $15 without a drink!"}
{"text":"It's a bit overpriced, but it has a nice neighborhood-y feel with vintage Westmount pictures on the wall. Sometimes I just want to hit up a place and get a sandwich, and this is in my neighborhood.

For whatever reason, the servers don't really appear to be into refilling drinks, which has happened almost every time I've gone. This isn't enough to keep me from going back, though--I sort of feel bad rating this 3 stars, but the description \"A-OK\" is pretty spot-on for this place."}
{"text":"Nick's is a classic neighborhood dinner with a long history in westmount.  Food is ok, decor is a bit tired, staff is friendly and efficient... but when it's your neighborhood dinner, somehow the food just tastes a bit better and a tired becomes cozy."}
{"text":"Chez Nick is a Westmount landmark, with fantastic, friendly service and a sizeable menu. It's a classic diner, so there isn't a lot in the way of veg* options, but some of the dishes can be tinkered with accomodate.

Definitely some of the best service I've seen in the greater Montreal area."}
{"text":"Nick's on Greene Street is an upmarket breakfast place with established local clientele. Both tables and booths available. Efficient, swift service and straightforward fare."}
{"text":"This is a decent neighbourhood place for breakfast.  I had the vegetarian omelette, it was good but nothing special.  Service was very friendly and prompt.  Decor is a little dated but the place is nice and clean.  I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here but it's a reliable place for breakfast if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I stopped by this restaurant the last time I was in Montreal for a quick lunch. The sandwich I got was good and it wasn't too expensive. Definitely a place I will go again when I'm not looking to spend to much, or it's a Sunday and everything else is closed."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, good food, oldest operating restaurant in Montreal. Clean and comfortable. Great service."}
{"text":"Although it's well located, it definitely lacks in quality.

Food : it's okay, I mean nothing tastes bad per say, but it's all stuff that you make at home when you're in a rush between your sons karate class and daughters ballet lesson.

Decor : simple, but true to what it has always been since opening decades ago. Nice.

Service : very good. The staff is very friendly and checks on you regularly. A+

This is a place to go when you're in a hurry."}
{"text":"Almost 100 years old, this is the oldest surviving restaurant in its *original* Westmount location serving diners and regulars since 1920. Fast and friendly service, it's a nice alternative to Schwartz's, Moishe's and Wilensky's. 

Recently featured on Montreal's MAtv, this place is an institution with loads of character and if you haven't yet dined here, it's a must-see restaurant that is off the beaten path, away from the touristy area, visit for breakfast, lunch or dinner. They also do delivery for the surrounding neighbourhood. 

They have great weekday breakfast menu options including Eggs, Bacon, Sausage, Omelettes, Bagels, Toast, English Muffins, Oatmeal, Granola, Fresh Fruits, etc. 

Their Weekend Brunch menu includes even more options such as Eggs Benedict, Feature Specials, Pancakes and CrÃªpes.

Dinner options include Salads, Soups, Sandwiches and Hot Meals from the Grill such as Fish, Chicken, Meatloaf, Pasta, Chili, Liver, Burgers and Poutine. Come for the atmosphere and stay for the service!"}
{"text":"Overpriced but pretty decent. Mazerattis parked out front when I was there... you can see where this is going."}
{"text":"Pretty cool diner. Varied menu, and very helpful staff. Service can be slow, but overall it's consistent. The food is just mediocre, nothing too special. The rosee sauce is very underwhelming, and the soup was very watery. The croissant was also chewy, and 'punctured'. The grilled cheese wasn't too shabby. The Boccocini et Basilic sandwich is one of the best vegetarian sandwiches, that's also very light, I've had (though it can have a slightly earthy taste due to the alfalfa sprouts). But again, the staff is superb (4 stars for service)!"}
{"text":"Thought place would have more character but it is just bad decor. Ordered a portobello brie sandwich and was disappointed! No sauce on it, mushrooms tasted like charcoal and i tried to wash it down with the water they served and all i tasted was chlorine and soil. The small order of fries are $4.65?! Why?"}
