{"text":"This place used to be amazing. I started eating here in late 2007, and they had by far the best General Tso's chicken I've ever had, and very good egg fried rice. Sometime around 2010 it all changed drastically. I've gone back several times since then, and it has not been great, but this last time I went it was just horrible. I ordered the same chicken, but some of the pieces were not cooked through, I had shell in my egg fried rice, and they were both very bland.

It makes me very sad because there really aren't any good Chinese restaurants on the west side, and to say that I'll never go here again is not something I easily do, but this place is just not worth it anymore."}
{"text":"Sorry to say we picked up a to go order tonight for the first time and was very disappointed in the dishes chicken sweet & sour was very dry with very little  peppers,onions and pineapple needed more of the juice. Also pork chop suey with hardly any juice to put over rice. Really I put mine in the trash.  I will not be going here again. sorry !"}
{"text":"Love it! My husband loves the hot and sour soup and the egg rolls are really excellent. We have tried all sorts of things on the menu from crab puffs to wonton, sweet & sour chicken, shrimp and pork, Tso' s chicken, cashew chicken, beef dishes,  chow mein, etc. Everything is great! Fresh, well seasoned, and very ample portions. People are helpful and courteous. We would recommend Abacus Arrowhead on 59th Ave. in Glendale to anyone!"}
{"text":"Delivery is not very good !! Was late and didn't bring plastic wear or plates or not even soy sauce! Very disappointed specially because we have order many times from there before and lately not getting good service."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner there tonight. Clean, friendly, great deal on delicious food. Good sized portions for a great price. We will definitely go back soon."}
{"text":"This place used to be a great place to eat. Now I must say it was a very bad experience. There were 6 of us today to celebrate a birthday. The wontons were burnt, the egg rolls were burnt and the lemon chicken was tough. I was very disappointed and won't be back for another celebration. Also not enough help. Had to get up and get silverware. Asked the waiter for more and he forgot. Also asked him for table chips and he said he would and never brought them. The place is too small and crowded to enjoy your meal. People on top of each other so to speak. The service was terrible. Also the place needs to have a good cleaning done."}
{"text":"They use good quality ingredients and the food is good. I love thier chef's special salad (cabbage and chicken)."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service... Dropped in for takeout spur of the moment visiting a friend- and before my flirty conversation was over with the cute girl, Alice, behind the counter- food was ready! (And wow, huge portions!)"}
{"text":"I eat here every time I'm working in the area. The service is excellent and so is the food. And it's really inexpensive!"}
{"text":"We have tried every Chinese food restaurant in the Northwest Valley...for the last 10 years, this is by far our favorite.  We especially like the value of the lunch specials."}
{"text":"Good chinese for a chain. Always consistent. Hot and sour soup os my fav. Actually has a bit pf spice."}
{"text":"I got the chicken lettuce wraps and it gave me food poisoning. The place is also filthy...look at the fans/vents and decor. It's like they don't clean at all - no wonder I got sick. I do not recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"Not worth it. The General Tso's chicken was over cooked. And they put the sause in the food tray but none on the chicken. The coating was soggy and fell off when you stabbed it with your fork. It tasted like leftovers, not freshly cooked. I also ordered a full order of crab puffs but only got a half order. Too bad I was hoping there was a good Chinese restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"Just tried this Chinese restaurant out today for takeout. Was going to stay but time didn't permit. The restaurant was packed which is usually a good indication. Great service. The food was actually phenomenal was surprised was so hot when we got it home for being take out too.  Definitely going to be going back. Reminded me of back east style Chinese restaurant.  Great experience! Abacus Inn awesome restaurant!"}
{"text":"Me and my daughter ate there last night, decided to dine in instead of doing carry out. Bad idea. I have actually always liked there food but usually get it to go. The food was good... I would give the food 3.5 stars. The service however,  I would give a zero! The gentleman that sat us at our table literally rolled his eyes, pointed at a table at that was it...thanks dude! Then the waiter without a smile or anything drops off the tea and menus and leaves (felt like we were bothering them being there the whole time). Comes back, takes our order...again no smile or anything kind. Our food gets dropped off by someone else and then we never see anyone again throughout the whole meal. We sit there for a while after being done...just looking around for someone to bring us a box and a check. I had to make a few throat clearing noises after waiting forever to finally get someone's attention.  Seriously the worst service ever at a dine in place... just order the food to go!"}
{"text":"Thanks to yelp we discovered our new favorite Asian restaurant. Small & not so fancy but they sure make up for it quality. It was hot in there when we walked in but they immediately lowered the air conditioner to accommodate us. The prices are a little higher than the other Asian restaurants that we've been going to but you get what you pay for. We ordered the Orange Beef which was a little sweet & spicy with orange slices arranged on the top, I can't wait to go back just for that. The Shrimp with Cream Sauce was excellent & loaded with shrimp. My mother wasn't too impressed with the Teriyaki Chicken but to be fair she doesn't care for white meat chicken & that's all they use in their chicken recipes, a big plus for most. My husband got the Abacus Special Chicken & it was excellent but he loved the sauce in the Orange Beef so much that he ended up dipping his chicken in the extra orange sauce I ordered on the side. Staff was very friendly too."}
{"text":"It's a small restaurant... One of those easily missed \"hole - in - the - walls\" that luckily I ran into. Absolutely the BEST orange chicken and beef & broccoli. Their chicken is lightly breaded , very crispy, and tender, definitely not the cheap chicken you find at other Chinese food places. The sauce is outstanding, with a light hint of orange flavor, without the actual orange peel. I like it extra spicy, and they nail it every time. 
Beef and broccoli has the most tender, non - fatty pieces of meat you will ever find. I still have not found any beef more tender, or even close to where this one is. Plenty of veggies, plenty of meat. 
I have since moved away, and nobody can come close to their quality and excellent taste. I just visited the area again and made this my first stop after landing, 45 minutes out of my way (one way), and it was worth it. It was as good as I hoped it would be. 
Food portions are generous...you will not go home hungry. 
The ONLY drawback is it is a small restaurant and you have to wait on busy nights. Take it to go on those nights. You will not be disappointed! 
This will be my first stop any time I fly into Phoenix."}
{"text":"Had lunch  today again. Love this place the only place  that has better orange  chicken  is my kitchen. I enjoy  this place for the oolong  tea and there wonderful  food. I can go have lunch by myself  or with a group  and the food and experience  is great. Right off the 101 and easy to find. I recommend  this place and there other locations as well as have  dined at them and the flavor is the same wonderful  delicious to enjoy. Stop in and enjoy"}
{"text":"We have been going for a few years and we do like it. The food is consistent and good. Is it the best Chinese we ever had - no, BUT its is very good. I always get beef and broccoli and have never been disappointed. We look forward to going again."}
{"text":"Noah is excellent at modifying the menu item to prepare it in a different way for me - so I'm able to really watch the content of sauces, and items of each dish.  The beef and broccoli is made of a great quality beef - I always get extra broccoli.  Noah will also let me trade out the dark sauce and replace with white wine (a little lighter) sauce for me. My boyfriends loves the General Tso!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese in the valley. Been going here since I was a baby (literally- started at the older location & moved up to this one) & am in love with this place! The staff is so friendly & the food is delicious!! The hot & sour soup is the best in the nation (well out of the 3 states I've tried it in-my fav soup)! Do yourself a favor & try it!"}
{"text":"We decided to give them a second try. First the service was horrible. We were never asked for our drink order and the menus were just dropped on the table. It is always hot in the dining room. The soup and Kung Pao were both tasteless. No third try coming."}
{"text":"Hot and Sour Soup is AWESOME!  Love it.  
Lunch menu is great deal.  Orange Chicken is family favorite.
Waiters are always super fast.  Have been coming here for over 10 years and service and food has always been consistent."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE FOOD!!!  Not to sound racist (I'm 100% Chinese), but the first sign of this not being authentic was the fact that there were no other Asians dining there.  This was our first and last time eating here.  The Kung Pao Chicken was not spicy and lacked flavor.  The Pepper Beef was also lacking flavor and was overly chewy.  The Hot & Sour soup was neither hot nor sour! How was this place so busy on a Saturday night?  Our severer graciously removed the Kung Pao Chicken from our bill and we didn't have the head to tell her that the entire meal was terrible!  I have never had a worse tasting Chinese food ever.  I would rather have terrible service and good food rather than have it the other way around.  The words alone in this review can't describe how bad the food is here."}
{"text":"I usually get the beef broccoli and fried rice and it's never let me down. It's a little expensive, but I think it's warranted for the amount of food they give. The portions are pretty big. You can't go wrong going here if you're craving decent Chinese food."}
{"text":"I just love this place! I've been coming here for a very long time, and the food is remarkably and consistently delicious! 
The service is impeccable, the pride of ownership is evidenced in all that is here to enjoy!"}
{"text":"Most amazing Chinese food place in Arizona. I'm from New York and I know my Chinese food and this is pretty close to New York as it gets fast and great friendly service."}
{"text":"The crab puffs and egg rolls are really good. They have great customer service. Their main courses are good, but not great. they have good consistency though."}
{"text":"My husband and I go at least 1x a month for Orange Chicken.  Big white chicken pieces...Big enough to split.  Yummy Chinese food.  Always good!  Tea included!  Good soup comes with lunch special.   We ask for 1/2 and 1/2 soup.  Yum!  Ask for warm from the kitchen sweet and sour sauce right away when sit down.... to dip the huge plate of  crunchys in.  All under $10."}
{"text":"We Order takeout here quite a bit and the food is fantastic. The food always taste fresh, I suggest the mongolian beef and the cashew chicken. The special chicken is great too if you like your fried foods. the only downside I have ever had is it took an hour and a half for delivery one time and I was pretty upset but the food makes up for it"}
{"text":"This food is authentic yummy goodness !!!! Small, quiet atmosphere and friendly service"}
{"text":"Walked into restaurant at noon today, was seated immediately. The entire place smelled like a sewer had backed up.  We sat there for a minute, husband had his menu stuck to the table. The waiter came over with hot tea and water and we then announced we were leaving as the place has a terrible sewer odor.  The waiter said \"odor?\"  That place needs the Board of Health to investigate it.  Absolutely disgusting. I'm not talking about a little \"smell\", the entire place reaked of some kind of backup odor. Go next door and have the pizza...."}
{"text":"Orange Chicken, Orange Chicken, Orange Chicken, Orange Chicken, Orange Chicken, Orange Chicken, Orange Chicken, Orange Chicken, Orange Chicken, Orange Chicken, Orange Chicken, Orange Chicken, Orange Chicken, Orange Chicken, Orange Chicken, Orange Chicken, Orange Chicken, Orange Chicken, Orange Chicken, Orange Chicken.

Got it?

Ok.  I'll let you order an eggroll too.  Their orange chicken is seriously good."}
{"text":"We got our food to go. The workers were very polite. 

Our total was about $44. 

Hot & Sour Soup-It was not good. It tasted almost sweet, like they used a sweet chili sauce to make it spicy. I'm sure the carrots & peas could also have contributed to the sweetness. It didn't taste sour at all. I miss the spicy sour flavor I was expecting. I will not get this again. 

Crispy calamari-it was still kind of crisp when we got home, so it must be really great when you get it in the restaurant. It came with some sweet & sour sauce that was separated. That was mildly off putting. However, I enjoyed the calamari. The strips were well cooked, not over cooked. I would get that again. 

Beef & broccoli-Basic yes, but my kids like it. It was pretty average but had more beef than broccoli, which normally I don't see. 

Shrimp & scallops in garlic sauce-this was a mild sauce. There wasn't a whole lot of flavor, but it wasn't bad. It did allow for the flavors of the shrimp & scallop to show through. It was only shrimps & scallops. I enjoyed it and would probably get it again. 
 
3 stars were because I liked the calamari and the shrimp/scallop dish, but the soup was probably one of the worst hot & sour soups I've ever had."}
{"text":"This is a nice, clean, and small place.  The service is prompt and friendly.  The food is good.  Ive come here more than a couple of times.  

The only reason I gave this place a 3 star review and not a 4 or 5 is because Ive been getting sick.  Ive noticed that the last 2 times I got sick I had Abacus Inn prior to getting sick.  It doesn't happen every time  but I think I've narrowed it down to the egg rolls.  Every time I get the egg rolls I get sick. 

I will be returning.  The food is good.  I will just try and stay away from the egg rolls."}
{"text":"food cool, like it was already made and not heated up, and no taste, rice was gross,  at the arrowhead location, had been going to 35 ave and thunderbird, for over 20 years, but when it changed owners it just was not the same, 
we spent over $30 and very dissapointed!!!! 
Not worth it!!!
i brought home the food  to my teenagers, and they said it was nasty. 
and they used to ask to go there all the time. 
sad , sad ,sad."}
{"text":"OK ~ It's been awhile and my Wife and I decided to give it another shot. After doing so, I just have one question. 'WHY IN THE F@#K IS THIS PLACE STILL OPEN?' I think we just had the worst dinner ever. Their food is HORRIBLE! What happened? It used to be so good. We used to come here all the time. We ordered 2 entrees, we were almost able to eat half of one, and threw away the rest. YUCK! Never again."}
{"text":"Today I was in the mood for Chinese and we had a coupon for this place, so off we went.
The restaurant ambiance was nice and cozy and the food came super quick. I ordered a shrimp foo yung based on a Yelp review. The quantity shocked me, it was so large! Taste wise, it was alright. Too much of fried stuff in it kind of turned me off.
I also ordered the veggie Chowmein which was nice. My husband ordered the Sun Devil Pork (garlic and jalapeno sauce) which he thought was alright.
Maybe we need to go back and order something else next time that will be nicer. All in all, the variety is great, service is excellent and its well priced too."}
{"text":"Fantastic delivery service. We've tried it twice and both times our orders arrived on time (within 40 minutes) and it was fresh and hot. The portions are large and the prices are reasonable given the great quality. We recommend the chicken or shrimp chow mein and fried wonton. The delivery men and ladies who took our orders were friendly. We'll definitely order delivery from here again."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Chinese food in the valley... my girlfriend and father both dislike any orange chicken they ever got and they devour Abacus Inn orange chicken to die for great service great prices"}
{"text":"My wife and I either eat in or take out on a regular basis and the food is fabulous. The service is always friendly and our take-out orders have been on time. The place is small and unassuming but you'll love it once you try it!! Good family-owned resturants deserve rave reviews and repeat visits :)"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in the valley.  Excellent price to quantity.  Dine in service is not the sharpest but the food makes up for the lack of great service."}
{"text":"We ordered takeout and could not have been more disappointed. Orange chicken extra spicy. No spice and the chicken had a chemical flavor to it. We are still not sure what that was. Mongolian beef was slightly sweet, but that was basically the only seasoning.  Pork fried rice had no flavor or color. It was obvious the person making it had not eaten fried rice before."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this location about 4 or so odd years and I have been very happy with them. If you want a cheap lunch with large portions, you have come to the right place. When you first enter a friendly server will seat you and then leave you with two menus. Then the server will quickly return with a hot steaming pot of tea, glasses of water, and then ask if you are ready. If not then they will return in a few minutes. I must say that I have never had more attentive servers than I had have here, and even better they are quick. That includes take out as well. 

Here is a break down of pros and cons.

Pros:
-The lunch prices are amazing. You get so much food for what you are paying.
-Their hot and sour soup is absolutely divine. 
-The tea tastes very good and the type they chose acts like a pallet cleanser.
-The food is very good quality. The rice is cooked in a traditional Chinese way, their meat is tender, and chowmein is never over cooked.

Cons:
-Dinner can get a bit expensive so I suggest you eat lunch here.
-The chicken was diced way too big and tended to be overwhelming, but when I returned I saw that they fixed that.

I have only been disappointed once because the food wasn't cooked very well, but they jumped right on it to straighten it out. I had a problem, they understood the problem, and then took care of the problem. I appreciated their understanding and commitment to their customers. If you are in the area, check them out because their lunch prices are worth the visit!"}
{"text":"The food here was really good. I would say I would go here again and the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is my chicken dish was not spicy at all when I was told it would be."}
{"text":"Excellent orange beef, large and flavorful egg rolls, and great hot n sour soup make this a great place for lunch or dinner.  Lunch specials are reasonable AND include soup.  Large luncheon portions.  I have had the pork egg food young also and it is equally delicious.  A nice touch is the free hot tea and noodles/sauce when dining in...A must try!!!"}
{"text":"Went there on 8/05/14 with my kids.  The wait staff was very pleasant, I have nothing negative to say about the service.   The interior was coolish, designed with a lot of Asian arts, your normal small hole in the wall dine in.  I ordered the wonton soup, chicken chow mein, and mongolian beef.  The soup came out first and the presentation was grand, it came out in a big bowl (enough for 4 pp to eat) with shrimp, boiled wontons, chicken, strips of pork and napa cabbage.  I was like \"Finally a good Chinese restaurant!\".  The broth itself was very tasty and so were the meats.  I fed my son (2 yr old) the wonton first because that's something he would like.  Upon first examining it, I noticed that it didn't look cooked but I assumed that that's probably the type of wonton they used.  My son ate it and spit it out. So I tasted it and it was uncooked.  It was still cold and doughy.  I was very bummed that I gave it to my little boy and that the soup was ruined.  Then I tried the napa cabbage and it was bitter...like old veggie bitter.  I told my kids to stop eating and when the server returned I told him the issue and he took it off my bill.  Then the entrees came out. The mongolian beef was very mediocre.  Mongolian Beef is one of my favorite Chinese dishes and it wasn't up to par at all with what I've had in the past, very  very plain.  The Chow Mein had good flavoring and my kids enjoyed the dish but the veggies were really raw and bitter.  So I decided to just box everything up and head home.  When I got home and warmed up the Chow Mein, I looked at the veggies again and saw black spots on them.  They were seriously over due and should have been tossed out instead of cooked or added to dishes for their guest.  We will not be going back to this place.  I've been in AZ for a year now and so far, I've been disappointed at every Chinese restaurant I've been too.  I mean Panda Wok taste better and that is very sad.  The only one that I kinda enjoyed was Bamboo off Happy Valley.  Prices are kinda high but at least they are consistent.  If anyone knows of a good Chinese restaurant, let me know so I can go check it out."}
{"text":"Been to this family owned restaurant for about a year or so. Did both dine in and take out and had great experience with customer service each time. The food isn't the greatest you'll have but it's not the worst. I would give the food rating 3 stars. My favorite is the sesame chicken. The portion size are huge and the price is decent. Couldn't ask for more from a small family owned Chinese restaraunt."}
{"text":"Wife and daughter ate here and got food poisoning. They had the shrimp lo mein. Beware!"}
{"text":"We just moved to phoenix from the  bay area of ca where we have  been eating great authenic chinese food from a great mom and pop chinese place for the last 5 years. We've been searching high and low for good chinese since we moved here, we were really hoping this was it as it delivers! The girl on the phone was very nice portions were large, delivery guy was nice and prompt but thats the best I've got to say. We didn't enjoy the food. It was not the authenic food we were hoping for, no where close to what we are used to in san fran. The food was over salted, over sauced, and all fried. It just didn't have much flavor.  The sweet and sour chicken was filled with canned pinapple?!The search continues, this place is not the answer to great chinese food here."}
{"text":"We went for dinner.

Environment-Appeared clean and casual a little small.  The restaurant was extremely warm and uncomfortable.

Service-Mediocre.  We waited sometime before getting our drink order taken.  Water refills were slow.  

Appetizers.  We got egg rolls and wontons.  The egg rolls were fantastic, in fact some of the best I ever tasted.  The wontons were good.

Dinner-We shared orange chicken, egg fried rice, and moo shoo pork.  The orange chicken was good, maybe slightly above average.  The egg fried rice lacked flavor/seasoning as did the moo shoo pork.  Salt on the rice helped, and we used soy on the moo shoo.  However, with no added seasoning it was very bland and below par.

I would go back but not seek it out."}
{"text":"This place lacks everything.. The food is disgusting. I threw up after I ate there food. It's just not good. It's sucks because Arizona lacks culture foods. Id rather go to Panda Express than step foot in that place."}
{"text":"This was a very disappointing representation of Chinese food!!  We ordered take out for the family - egg rolls (the won ton skin was not fried and mushy), wor won ton soup (there's was less than a teaspoon of fitting in the won ton - very pasty and the broth was flavorless),  the house special fried rice was flavorless, abacus special chicken was over done and dry (thank goodness for the sauce that we had to drown it in to swallow), the General Tso chicken and Mongolian beef were less than mediocre.  I asked if the Abacus chow mein had Hong Kong style noodles & they asked me what that meant- a term a good an authentic Chinese restaurant would know - It's a crispy thin noodle.  They told me it was a crispy noodle and they were but it was the type you get out of the can in the grocery store.  The best thing about the meal was the fortune cookie that was made somewhere else."}
{"text":"My favourite Chinese Restaurant. Better than PF or any of that nonsense. I order the Orange Chicken, Chicken Chow Mein or Mu Shu Pork and I love them all! I crave this place and its deliciousness, maybe it's the addictive MSG but for once, I don't even care! 

On my last visit, the owner gave everyone a Chinese Calendar as a holiday gift which was kind! Fair warning, some of the staff are strange but most of them a great! 

You should go there now."}
{"text":"I'm of Asian descent born in the states and I am pretty familiar with my Chinese food. Parents were visiting from the Bay Area and we had already visited the Chinese Cultural center, so I thought we could hang closer to home. 

Very cute and clean restaurant. Plate full of fried wonton skins as well as a pourable container of sweet & sour sauce were awaiting at every table. Which made me skeptical as to how long it had been sitting there. Decent prices. Service was fast and friendly.

My parents had the egg drop soup to start. They said the soup was not bad as it had pieces of chicken and water chestnut throughout. Good start. My mother had the teriyaki chicken and my father and I had the shrimp in lobster sauce. Large portions and wafting aromas were very promising. 

I was so hoping that this place would have good Chinese food. It is freeway close, not too many miles from home. Alas, we were very disappointed in the meals. The teriyaki chicken (bummed also that it did not come with any veggies) over rice was drowned in a heavily salted and sugared teri sauce. There was not one iota of white left in the rice. She had 3 pieces and stopped. Granted the chicken was not over done and it was all breast meat. The shrimp with lobster sauce, also drowned, but in a heavily salted lobster sauce. Lots of shrimp, but not very edible on our taste scales."}
{"text":"Great pricing and excellent service. This is our go to Chinese restraunt. I recommend the orange chicken."}
{"text":"Have dined here and also had takeout. Has been very good every time. Large portions and reasonable prices. The Orange chicken is a favorite.   A little out of the way for us but worth the trip"}
{"text":"The place is very compact. Started with their honey chicken  this dish was Great nice and crispy skin with no breading.  I ordered their shrimp chow mein. The dish came with a lot of noodles and crunchy broccoli which is perfect for me  . We finished with their sun devil chicken . The service was good"}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum. Beef n veg was on point today . The water, hot tea and egg drop soup were all great! It was a hot one today and we were seated by the door. Thank goodness there weren't many people dining while I was there because it was kinda warm and opening the door only made matters worse! Boxed up half my lunch and took it into Safeway with me while I shopped. Definitely try to finish your meal in the restaurant were it tastes best!"}
{"text":"Has been my go to Chinese place for a few years now. The sweet and sour chicken and orange chicken do not fail. The place looks deceiving and trashy but the food is amazing."}
{"text":"By far the worst Asian food I've ever had.  The won tons were horrible, they had NO cream cheese in the center and were totally burned, tasted like they were deep fried last year.  How can you screw up Moo shoo veggies, they did?"}
{"text":"Love this place, dine in or takeout food is always excellent, generous portions and very reasonable prices .  Service is with a smile and appreciation each and every visit.  

Szechuan and Orange chicken are my favorites.  I always ask for extra heat, they always accommodate.  Egg rolls are large,crispy and flavorful. We got hot & sour this time, it was good, but my favorite is their egg flower soup with the wonton chips.    If takeout I always get the large to be sure I have leftovers.  Brother loves their Kung pao with extra heat of course.   

Abacus is worth the 13 mile drive, you can count on quality food and service every visit."}
{"text":"Great food, we found our favorite place for Chinese food here on AZ! You must try the dinner for two, we had the chefs special and it was very good!"}
{"text":"Really yummy Chinese food! I recommend the lemon chicken and spicy beef! We get it for the work office and everyone loves it!"}
{"text":"Yet again another great take-out meal from Abacus.  Ordered Beef Fried rice, Chicken Chow Mein, Egg Fried rice and Orange Chicken; side of Wantons.  Out the door for under 35 dollars with always available coupon.  The order was piping hot and exactly correct down to the side of Hot Oil.  The food is so good and take out orders are delivered in heavy duty sealed containers, microwave ready for leftovers because there is no way you can eat the portions!  We've been coming here for lunch and dinner for many years and I can honestly say have never been disappointed.  The dine in experience is just as good."}
{"text":"This place is great! Have been going here for over 10 years. Great service and great food. Portions are rediculously large for the price."}
{"text":"Compared to the Orange chicken I had last at Good China Abacus is 10 times better. Hot and sour soup very good. Place crowded at noon lunch a testament to the food quality.  My neighbor hood favoritem"}
{"text":"Ordered \"Inn\" last night. Pun intended.
Orange Chicken, Pu Pu Platter and House Chow Mein (I freeze most of it so I can have dinner when needed.)

Everything was perfect!

Orange Chicken was not a thick breading like most other places. It was very thin and flavorful. 

Everything in the platter was not overcooked.

Chow mein...no clue. Froze it.

Will be my number one Chinese delivery...as long as they keep up the good product."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!  It was very clean, the servers are extremely nice and super quick service.   The number one thing about this place that was shocking is the quality of ingredients they use.  The beef was thick, the shrimp was huge, and the chicken is all white meat.  The veggies are fresh and the rice is perfect.  I was really impressed.  My hubby raved about the hot & sour soup, and everything we have tried is excellent.  They also give you hot tea and its delish.  If you go for the lunch specials, its and excellent value so much for cheap.  Dinner is a little more, but still a good value, we always have to take food home."}
{"text":"Great egg drop soup.  Kung pao chicken - meh.  Beef broccoli - yum."}
{"text":"Not the best... or even average. I ordered take out from here, and just finished eating right now. I got the crab puffs which had been highly reviewed from a fellow yelper. I was very disappointed, yes they were large. but not filled with crab or anything tastey...just filled with cold cream cheese. 

my entree much in the same. it was cheap chicken that was oversalted. i think that the chef must be a smoker because he obviously cannot taste the salt content in his food.

The place was pretty full, so i'm guessing some of their dishes must be alright or people wouldn't eat there. I dont think ill be going back anytime soon, or ever at all. 

Next time ill just go to Panda Express across the street. its alot cheaper."}
{"text":"I ordered take away yesterday from this place, I have to admit I've not seen many Chinese places that serve all white meat at dark meat prices & that their food tasted good, the hostess was pleasant and polite, rice quantity was quite a bit more than other places, overall I'll give them 4 stars!!!"}
{"text":"Placed a pick up order they advised me that it would be 15 min. When I arrived I noticed a lot of people waiting. The guy next me said he has been there waiting for 20 min for his order he placed it over a half hour ago. It took 40 min for my pick up order!  For years I have always ordered the Abacus crispy noodle chow main with the crispy noodles on the side as they would be gross by the time I get home. Tonight I called and went to place my order was told they can no longer do that it has to be all mixed together at the same time. I asked are you sure I was just there last week? Yes I am sorry no exceptions. I said yes I am sorry as well and cancelled my order which was going to be a big one as I have 2 growing boys! Complete bummer as we always enjoyed the food will not be returning."}
{"text":"This was my first visit, we were looking for a Chinese restaurant that offers lunch combinations on the weekends. This did not disappoint. I had the orange chicken, it came with an egg roll, fried rice and egg drop soup. The fried rice could have been better, but everything else was delicious."}
{"text":"cashew chicken had no flavor at all, egg rolls equally bland

restaurant was very clean service was exceptional but i doubt ill be back"}
{"text":"Just ate here last week for the first time last week and it is now officially my favorite Chinese spot and they were so friendly there. My husband loved the sweet and sour pork, me and my son had the chicken teriyaki yummm and the egg flower soup is awesome. I'm not a huge fan of leftovers but there food leftover was great.  The chicken teriyaki was made with white meat and many places only use dark so that's a plus in my book."}
{"text":"Been here a few times each time I have been here the food and service was out standing.. They have some of the best orange chicken and there crab puffs have lots of filling in them.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I read the less than stellar reviews on here and decided to try it anyway. The restaurant is located next to Albertson's on 59th Ave, just north of the 101. It's a smaller restaurant, probably 10 tables and 10 booths. We were greeted promptly by the hostess and given the choice of a booth or a table... we took the booth (of course). Tea was served promptly. The menu tells a little back story of the restaurant and how it was voted best Chinese food in Phoenix in 1999 by the Arizona Republic.

The menu has all the usual suspects for a Chinese restaurant, and a couple of newcomers. I decided to branch out and get the Sun Devil Chicken (ASU Baby!). It's white chicken (all their chicken dishes are) with a creamy garlic/jalapeno sauce and with fresh sliced jalapenos mixed in. She got orange peel chicken. We decided to share an appetizer of crab puffs.

I barely got through one cup of tea by the time they arrived. They were hot, fresh and were huge! 8 of them came in an order, along with hot mustard and sweet and sour sauce. Normally judge a Chinese restaurant by the quality of their crab puffs. Abacus may have the best I've ever had.

Soon after the entrees arrived. Both were HUGE and had a complete bowl of rice. I tried both dishes, both were good... I won't go into the \"It was so savory with a hint of spice\" crap that everyone on here thinks they are giving an audition for Iron Chef. We ended up taking about half of each home and will be going again without question.

Price was decent. Both dishes were $8.25 and the crab puffs were $5.50. The check came with 2 fortune cookies. Mine said \"You will soon be surrounded by luxury\"... her's said... well, we'll never know... because she ended up eating the fortune. Which prompts, thing's you are very unlikely to hear at a Chinese restaurant.... \"Did I just eat my fortune?\"

They have lunch specials and also deliver between:
35th Ave & 83rd Ave
Bell Rd & Jomax Rd."}
{"text":"In 1999 the Arizona Republic voted Abacus Inn Best Chinese in the Valley. That is sad because most Chinese food is better. This is a small neighborhood restaurant located in an Arrowhead Strip Mall. 

One thing I used to like about this restaurant was the hot tea and fried noodle service that was served to us like the same as from ALL the American/Chinese Restaurants used to do back east. The complimentary noodles are no more but they do still serve you a complimentary pot of hot tea.

I thought I had a fond memory of the Sizzling Rice with Chicken Dish so I tried it again. The best part of this dish was the rice. Only an expert cook can get the pan at the just right heat and pop the rice and pass it so someone to serve it sizzling. I do have to say the rice was very good and had texture and more flavor than rice normally has. Most of the vegetables on my plate were fresh and crisp and some were from frozen like the peas and tiny square cuts of carrot. I don't know what quality the chicken was and some of the white meat was tender and some of the white meat was like chewing a tire. It was just like that LAST chicken I purchased from WinCo. Some of it good and some of it weird and gross like rigor mortis already set in. I do like sweets...I am a sweet eater but the sauce was too sweet for me and lacked flavors The sauce tasted mostly just sweet and soy sauce. 

My husband had the Spicy Sliced Beef.  All the beef was tender in his dish and the vegetables were fresh and tender crisp but that sauce was the same as mine very sweet but with a little more flavor.

I've had better than this from Take Out Chinese Restaurants."}
{"text":"Abacus Inn has really yummy food. It is very small so if you get any type of social anxiety this is not the place for you because you sit very close to everyone. This would be a 5 Star review for me if their water didn't have a weird after taste and if they had clean, clear glasses. On occasion I get a \"foggy\" glass or see some type of residue and it grossed me out. The staff is very friendly and will urgently get you a new glass but when stuff like this happens, I can't help but feel they're being thorough in the back."}
{"text":"This is not your typical cookie cutter Chinese food. Chicken cuts are better than most Chinese places, and the recipes are original. That being said, the original recipes are pretty bad. Hot and sour soup tastes more like bland and tangy soup. I really appreciated the quality chicken that was used in the General Tso's but the breading was soggy, the sauce incredibly bland, and not nearly enough quantity of sauce. When all is said and done, I'd rather have the standard \"cruddy cookie cutter Chinese food\" place than this."}
{"text":"This place is a local hidden gem. I love how they serve free tea to start off before you even think of ordering anything! Furthermore, I enjoy the food here because all of it is absolutely amazing!"}
{"text":"Have visited the location on 35th and Tbird and always order their amazing Kung Pao Chicken. Not so amazing at the Arrowhead location. Too many green onions (I thought I got the wrong order until I found a few peanuts) and chicken was dry. Didn't finish it. Fried rice was good as was the egg roll. Crab puffs were pretty small, though. Hoping this is just an isolated situation as my workplace has moved to the arrowhead area."}
{"text":"Big portions, but it is a bit expensive. The delivery guy showed up an hour after I ordered. The shrimp fried rice so far after going through almost half of it had only ONE SHRIMP lol. I recommend avoiding this place if you can, but for chinese place that delivers, you can do worse."}
{"text":"The orange chicken is delicious!! You can't beat the lunch specials, entree, egg roll, 2 won tons, rice and soup. Hot and sour soup is also very good. This is my favorite place to get orange chicken."}
{"text":"Got over $70 worth of take out and when we got it home, no white rice. Where's Noah when we need him?"}
{"text":"4 stars for this Glendale Chinese food. If there are better places in Glendale, please tell me. I love coming here with my mom when I am in town, the chicken lo-mein lunch special makes me happy."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this restaurant for over 10 years and there are times that they have had by far the best Chinese food, Valley wide! Most of the time the food is awesome and once in a while we will get one of our favorites that is not as great as usual but still good. (We believe they have 2 cooks and one is just a little better than the other). Great Egg Rolls,Beef & Broccoli, war wonton soup, house F rice, SS chicken, lemon chicken are our favorites and are very good. the veggies are always fresh. Even the drinking water, they made the investment to have their own RO system which makes a big difference on the food and drinks. Have you ever been some where and the drinking water is horrible? The food rocks!
Only down turn to me is that it is a small place with not a lot of seating. I recommend going early on the busy days or enjoy during the week. I grew up to very good C. food and it took me 10 years in Phoenix before I found what this place offers, which is great flavored Chinese food with fresh ingredients!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in my food. Fake Chinese food if you ask me. I ordered the house special chicken with mushrooms. Hardly had any sauce. Tastes just like fried chicken. The best part? The mushrooms was canned and just dumped on the chicken. I expected fresh mushrooms. Kung pao chicken had no spice. Bland and no flavor. The veggies was good and that's about it. I won't be back. I'm sure I can find better tasting Chinese food."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! We love the Crab Puffs, Egg Fried Rice, Orange Chicken, Sesame Chicken and the Abacus Chicken!! You get tons of food for what you pay for we always end up coming home with extra it's great!"}
{"text":"I have been here at least a baker's dozen times when visiting. The food is fresh and consistent, the service reliable, and the lunch specials are very reasonably priced. Overall, it's a somewhat generic menu. To my taste, the kung pao dishes are generally over sauced, a bit mushy in texture, and not very hot/spicy. Yet overall everything is tasty. The lunch portions are huge and reheat well. Their best dish is the hot and sour soup.
This is my dad's favorite Chinese restaurant in Phoenix and I don't need to have adventure-some dining when out with him. In addition, my parents came here for years. When my mom got lung cancer and could no longer go out, Dad would order the soup to go - and the owner was incredibly kind to her in her last months. How can I not continue to patronize such a human being??"}
{"text":"We went for dinner the other night.  The place is nicely appointed abet a little small.  The staff was very nice and competent.  We tried the Sizzling Rice soup, very nice.  The main dishes came in large portions with rice served separately in a covered bowl.  Chicken dishes were made with diced chicken breasts.  Vegetables tasted fresh.  The only issue we had was the flavors were distinctly bland.  My Kung Pao Chicken lacked any heat and the wife's Ginger Chicken was also lacking ginger/garlic flavor.  Otherwise, they do a good job."}
{"text":"I'm pretty surprised by the reviews. We have been here more than a handful of timea for lunch and dinner. Food is fresh and plenty. Service is pleasant. Only drawbacks are long wait times for carry out and dine in. Orange chicken and hot sour soup are delicious!"}
{"text":"The Chinese food here is some of our favorite in the valley. They have great veggie fried rice and Orange chicken. We have never had a chicken dish that we don't like here and we've tried most of them. Their chow mein is really good! It's always packed full of the meat and vegetables too. Their portion sizes for dinner entrées are huge! We always have leftovers for a few days. The crab wontons are always so crispy! My family and I order from here at least once a month if not more!"}
{"text":"The Abacus Inn was very clean and the customer service was excellent. On the other hand the food was terrible it tasted as if it came from the freezer or out of a package. I have had better chinese food from the grocery store. The tea had to be Lipton and lacked all the flavor normal tea has in Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"I've had Chinese food all across the US, and I have to say this place, by far, is the worst I ever had. The fried won ton was too thin and overcooked. The shrimp egg foo young was hard and tasted like cardboard and no shrimp was inside the patty, but poured on top of the patty with tons of gravy,  peas and carrots, like they forgot to cook the patty with the shrimp and threw it on as an afterthought. The shrimp fried rice was not cooked with enough soy sauce and was flavorless. They were also horribly overpriced. The only reason I gave one star was because the shrimp on the egg foo young were pretty huge and tasted good, and the crab puffs (rangoon) were fairly decent. First and last time."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. The Pu Pu  platter is excellent and just enough of everything. The eggrolls are nice and crispy and filled to the max. Lunch always offers soup with their lunch special. Very fresh and great service. It may be a small place but it's mighty. This is where the locals go."}
{"text":"This place is small and in a very uninteresting strip mall, but the food is wonderful.  Service is good and quick.  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese type food in the Glendale area. For the money you will have enough leftovers for another meal. Great food, great value."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Chinese food restaurants. I suggest the hot and sour soup with orange chicken for lunch. Food is amazing and very reasonably priced. I have been going here for over 10 years and love it."}
{"text":"Not the right place if you are looking for authentic Chinese food. However, the food is pretty good here. Reasonable price with generous potion. 2 dishes feed 3 adults and sometimes would have leftover. Good quality and good value. I haven't had anything bad from this place."}
{"text":"Great food, and friendly, prompt service.  We dined in a couple of times, but usually get carry out.  This is definitely my favorite go-to for Chinese food."}
{"text":"After all the rave reviews we were extremely disappointed with the quality of our meals. The orange chicken luncheon came out being lemon chicken mostly bread with dry chicken within.  The Abacus Chicken Special luncheon was again extremely over breaded dry chicken breast.  The hot and sour soup as mildly better and I might have though it good but believe the peas and carrots were from a can.  It was sadly disappointing as I was so hoping to find a good Chinese place somewhat close to home"}
{"text":"We ate here for the last time on Friday. I have to say, the food was fairly good. But this review isn't about the food. We were seated in the one booth that looks into the kitchen. Big mistake. After our meal, I noticed the waitress pouring liquid into a large percolator-type coffee urn. It looked like she was pouring from a small tea pot. Sure enough, I sat and watched while she poured pot after pot of tea that had been sitting on tables, back into this urn to be served again. By now my kids were watching, too, and the manager walked into the kitchen and spoke to the waitress. She imediately stopped what she was soing, but as tables were cleared, the staff continued to set tea pots next to this urn. Now I personally don't drink the tea, but I have seen people do all kinds of things to these teapots--add ice, add sweetener, toss in a couple of lemon slices. Grossed me out and made me wonder what they were planning to do with that eggroll on my son's plate..."}
{"text":"Paid $30+tip for two bland lunch combos with no spice or flavor. The only semi-redeeming items were the hot and sour soup (which we got charged $7 extra for when it comes free with the lunch combo if you dine in- it didn't redeem the meal THAT much) and the crab puffs (we should just just gotten like three orders of these plus soy sauce. Pretty disappointed because I remember the Abacus Inn in Ahwatukee being amazing growing up.  Heard the one on Bell Rd is better so we may give it a try after the unimpressive experience with this one is forgotten."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for many years.  In fact, this is now my third update.  This place is very consistent.   Always good.  Large portions.  Everything is fresh and hot.  I usually eat in for lunch and get \"to go\" food at night.  My parents get delivery on a consistent basis.  Everything I have tried is superb.  The only average dish, in my opinion, is the egg fu young.  Please do not believe the negative reviews.  I have lived in Phoenix over 30 years and have tried many Chinese restaurants and this is one of the best.  Not a fancy atmosphere but great food."}
{"text":"If I could give it a negative star I would! Fried wontons stale & awful, Kung Pao chicken was so dry it was not worth eating, sun devil pork was stringy & filled with gristle! Awful! We didn't even eat any, told the waitress how awful it was & she did nothing. Had coupon for free dinner b1g1 & they refused to take it! Do yourself a favor don't go!"}
{"text":"Been coming to this place for over a decade now.  Always good service and the food is always fresh.  People leave poor reviews because they only tried one dish and never give a reason why they are disappointed.  There is a reason why you have to wait to get seated for dinner and sometimes lunch because they have a very good business.  Owner is always working hard along with the staff.  Keep up the great work!!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place for 24 years and it never disappoints. You will not find a better value for your dollar. No where has better egg drop soup, egg rolls or orange chicken. And their egg rolls are huge! Love them!"}
{"text":"We love to order the vegetable chow mein  with crispy tofu. It is a huge meal and serves two."}
{"text":"I really liked the fact that they give ice water and tea. Trying to lay off the soda. Staff was prompt and attentive. I ordered a chicken chow mein lunch special came with egg roll, rice and chips. The chicken chow mein was good. The rice was ok. And the egg roll and chips could not eat. Egg roll was dry and stale, chips did not taste. Overall the restaurant looks good."}
{"text":"I can count how many times we have ordered from here!At least 5 years. Last weeks' order was spot -on once again!- Sure, we may have to wait 30 to 45 mins, but we plan on that, have a cocktail sit down & relax.
Chicken in all the dishes we get is nicely cubed white meat, Sweet n Sour Pork just the right amount of sauce, Hot beef dishes are always a fav! Egg rolls are big & crispy.
They are generous with the rice, but we usually tell'em to hold off on it...one time we got  freebie crab cakes for letting them know. Keep up the great service!"}
{"text":"For Chinese in Phoenix, this is my place now.  Just discovered it, and boy! do I love their food.
I usually judge a Chinese restaurant by how good their hot 'n sour soup is, because most places seem to have no clue how to make it--but Abacus surely does.  The best hot sour I ever had loaded with chunks of veggies and flavored just perfect!
Had their lemon chicken, and the meal was so huge I brought half home--all for something like $8.  The prices are right here!
Everything here seems to be good according to my tablemates, too.
Cannot wait to hit this place again!"}
{"text":".......Where are the chopsticks?

A Chinese restaurant is clearly not Chinese when there are no chopsticks on the place setting! Tea was lukewarm upon arrival, tasted unauthentic, with the help of any ambiguous American tea bag. The hot and sour soup had peas...peas! Side of rice was stiff and tasted as if it had been in the cooker all day. Had the stir fry vegetable dish that consisted of broccoli, snow peas and mushrooms overly cooked to mush; where was my bok choy or kai lan or any type of actual authentic Chinese vegetables?!

One thing I do give them credit for: service was clean, fast, and efficient.

Other than that, your money's better off at Panda Express right down the street. Same quality of food, and at least there you won't have to pay for tip!"}
{"text":"2.5 stars, barely.  Based on their food alone, they deserve 2 stars.  Lunch specials are drenched in sauce, beef are chewy and not tender, and onion pieces are cut too long that it doesn't fit in one bite.  Egg rolls are huge resembling something that is not an egg roll.  Go to George and Son's in Glendale if you want better Chinese lunches for similar price.  They do serve you tea for free though (although very heavy/dark/non-fresh) that pushes them up to 2.5 stars."}
{"text":"Take-out order review.

Overall the food was decently good, better than Pei-Wei, Panda Express, and those chain restaurants.  Quick service, friendly. 

Hot and Sour soup was too watery and too sweet and not enough sour. 
Steam rice was cook correctly, not dry from sitting around too long.
Mongolian beef was good. Meat was tender and not overcooked.
Cashew chicken was excellent, vegetables not overooked and limp but firm and crispy.
Teriyaki chicken was also good, lots of meat, chicken tender, not too much sugary flavor. 

Plenty of food for the price.

My biggest complaint would be not enough spices, chili pepper, or heat in general. Need to kick it up a notch.

Would eat here again but ask for more chili."}
{"text":"Ordered Orange Chicken, Teriyaki Chicken, and Vegetable Chow Mein. Orange Chicken was great, Teriyaki chicken was Dry and overly sweet.

Had 50% off my full order coupons, and when I presented it, the server only took off $5. Make sure you clarify the coupon."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying that I am not a Chinese food connoisseur. But I do love to have lunch over here whenever I'm on this side of town. 

If you're looking for some gong bang for your buck, you've found it. The lunch servings are generous, and the prices are low. All lunch items come with these yummy fried won ton crunchy things, a cup of soup, fried rice, an egg roll, and of course, whatever you ordered. All meals - lunch and dinner- also come with hot tea. 

I've been for both lunch and dinner, but I really recommend going for lunch if you're in the area, because it's just a great deal. And the selection is pretty wide, as well as vegetarian friendly. 

My favorite thing here is their hot and sour soup. I had honestly never eaten soup at a Chinese food restaurant before Abacus, because they always grossed me out. But I love their hot and sour soup. It has just the right amount of hot and the perfect amount of sour. This soup even inspired me to try making it myself at home because I started craving it, but I live so far away. 

Oh yeah, every meal also comes with free dessert: a fortune cookie  My last one said that I would start writing some great reviews. But I don't think you're really supposed to add \"in bed\" to the end of that one."}
{"text":"Great spot for lunch, fast service, great food.  I especially love the Sun Devil Chicken, it's probably not the most traditional Chinese dish, but garlic sauce with jalapeños is delicious.  The House Special Chicken is also great."}
{"text":"Abacus has excellent food for takeout or if you want to eat in. If you are from the east coast the wonton soup will see a little different because they include shrimp and chicken along with all the other ingredients you would expect. It is very very good. Not cheap so don't expect this quality for less."}
{"text":"Food has always been delicious every time that I have gone here. Unfortunately the service is not very good. I only return because I love the food."}
{"text":"I love supporting this family owned, hole in the wall local business. It's our go-to for take out. Great portion sizes, fresh food. Hot and sour soup is on point!"}
{"text":"The good is good and served in a decent portion, but the service is really slow. They should consider hiring more people.  The waiter was dropping water on the table and on my egg roll.  The phone kept ringing and ringing and ringing and nobody would answer. It became a nuisance."}
{"text":"I've never had worse food - of any kind. It was inedible and gave my poor mother food poisoning. She has been violently sick since an hour after she ate it.
For my b'day, my elderly mother came out from Boston. She wanted Chinese food and Yelp rated this place pretty highly so we gave it a try although it seems we have a decided lack of decent Chinese Food Restaurants in Arizona compared to other states.
Ordered: 
Beef Chow Mien and received a container full of lo-mein noodles with four quarter-sized slices of rubbery, flavorless beef, 3 chunks of yellowing, limp broccoli and 4 pea pods in a flavorless sauce.
Pork Fried Rice - received a container of sticky, mushy, overcooked white rice - again flavorless, with some peas, carrots and a few shreds of unidentifiable white meat.
Pork Egg Foo Yung - An oil slick of congealed flavorless brown sauce topped with the prerequisite peas n' carrots topped with slices of fatty, gristly pork. It looked like throw up and tasted not much better. I gave my dog a piece of the \"pork\" and he spit it out. Too bad my mother didn't do the same. I've had Egg Foo Yung in 18 different states and this did not resemble any foo yung I'd ever seen. Supposed to be an omelette made with eggs, fresh sliced chineses veggies and meat/pork/chicken, pan fried and covered in a brown sauce...not a pile of canned peas and carrots with slices of meat mixed with a scrambled egg and congealed sauce.
Honey Glazed chicken wings - Rubbery boiled chicken covered in honey and sesame seeds. Not crispy or crunchy, rubbery, overly sweet and again, FLAVORLESS. Looked like it had been microwaved.
Crab Puffs - At least they were edible, more cream cheese than crab, but at least they were cooked well and tasted OK.
I ended up throwing all of it in the trash (what a waste of $40.00) as it was an inedible mess (except for the crab puffs). They should be ashamed to serve customers this garbage. My husband and I only ate a few bites (thank God!) and I felt slightly sick whereas my mother ate more and is very, very ill. Unfortunately, she will miss her plane back to Boston and have to continue to stay at her motel as she is too weak and sick to fly so this horrible meal cost her over $750.00.
I've had better frozen chinese food and made better at home. If I could rate it a negative 3 stars, I would. They should be shut down by the Board of Health!"}
{"text":"This review is ONLY regarding my take-out experience a few weeks back. 

It was raining and cold, and I really did NOT want to go home and cook after a long work day. I called ahead and ordered a serving of won-ton soup to go. I was on hold for a bit (and by hold I mean the phone was set down while they took care of another customer's payment) but they were quick to apologize and reassured that they did not forget me. When I picked up my order, it was ready for me and I didn't have to wait. The young girl at the front was very welcoming and a great conversationalist. From the brief glimpse I saw of the actual restaurant, the staff is extremely welcoming and the it was pretty full on a Monday night, which tells me that the food is good. My won-ton soup was delicious and they were generous with the won tons, chicken, shrimp and veggies. I loved it! I must go back to actually dine in, and to get more won ton soup. Besides my mom's, I would say it was one of the best that I've had. Cannot wait to have more of it on another cold day!"}
{"text":"For the most part, Abacus Inn is a clean and reliable choice for Chinese. The prices are reasonable, about like you would expect, in the 7.5 to 11 range for most dishes. Some of the chicken dishes are a little dry, but I really enjoy the beef with snow peas and chow main."}
{"text":"Delicious, friendly staff. Favorite item there are the Crab Puffs, yum!!"}
{"text":"The chefs special cabbage salad is a diets dream food!  It's super yummy and can only have 3 calories.  The food here is super yummy and the family is super nice!"}
{"text":"I have been living in the Phoenix area for over a year now and had yet to find a great Chinese food place. I have had a few friends recently mention how great Abacus Inn was, so I knew I had to try it. Let me tell you, it did not disappoint. The crab wontons were amazing. Orange chicken was flavorful and tender! Chow mein was full of delicious veggies and chicken! The portions are very large! The staff was very friendly as well. Even though they were quite busy when I came in, the hostess was kind enough to pause to help me decide what to order. I will definitely be returning! I highly recommend trying this place, your tastebuds and stomach will thank you!"}
{"text":"I love Abacus Inn! My family and I have been eating here for so long. We used to dine in but we moved to New River and we order Togo now. I love their Sizzling Rice Soup, egg rolls, and fried rice. My husband and kids love pretty much everything too but their favorite is the Orange Chicken. The staff is amazing and cooks. I will travel far just to eat here. Thank you all so much!"}
{"text":"Not the first time I have been here and won't be the last.  Good Chinese food at a good price.  The egg flower soup had a generous portion of chicken in it, making it very much like another order of food and not just an appetizer.
The sun kept shining through the window as we at near sunset, so that  was the only detractor of the decor.

In addition to the soup we had the sweet and sour pork, beef broccoli, and teriyaki chicken (mostly 'cause our kids are picky.)  All were good."}
{"text":"Called in a take-out order for orange chicken and sweet & sour pork.  Pulled up and tons of people waiting inside and out for a table.  Good sign of great food in a sleepy little strip mall!  Hearty chunks of quality meat with minimal breading.  Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, my family and I have noticed a marked drop off in quality & quantity over the last six months. We have ordered delivery from Abacus for the last 5 or 6 years. An example is the shrimp in garlic sauce. It started out as a substantial portion size, but the last 2 times we ordered, it was like a soup with a few pieces of shrimp. We save the to go containers for reuse for our leftovers at home and the new containers are now 1 inch deep instead of the 2 inches that we got before. (major drop in quantity)"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch on the way to the airport.
Ordered luncheon specials.
They came out within minutes.
The shrimp in lobster sauce was not made in the correct sauce. It came in a brown sauce with cut up bell peppers instead of white translucent sauce and peas. My husband had Kung pao chicken which was in the same brown sauce as my shrimp with lobster sauce! My daughter had general Tao chicken which was fine. They each came with egg roll which was very oily and the rice was a sticky ball. A lot of food for the price, but, sub par on the taste. As we were leaving, we were given a calendar and wished happy new year. Funny, the calendar was a 2017 calendar!"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic neighborhood restaurant. Friendly waiters and fair prices. Try the Sun Devil or Orange Chicken."}
{"text":"Abacus is the best! They have the best hot and sour soup I've ever tasted. Eggrolls are awesome too. I've tried many things on the menu and have never been disapointed. 
I can't comment on the table service because I always get take-out but the cashier has always been very nice. 

Be sure to ask for thier special mustard, it's awesome too."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good but I HATE going in to eat. The restaurant is too small and crowded. The atmosphere just feels uncomfortable and the service is lacking. They need to deep clean this place and have better customer service. Always iffy about eating here because it's dirty."}
{"text":"Once again the food was excellent. We had it delivered . It did take about 45 minutes but the wait was worthed. The orange chicken was really good. What I like about this place is that they don't cheat you on the meat proportions. Even the shrimp dishes."}
{"text":"A coworker recommended this place to me, she claim this place to be amazing, so amazing that I'll travel great distance for this place.  So amazing that I'll never eat anywhere else again.  So amazing that I'll tip a million dollars, so amazing that I'll cry!  After hearing that, my buddies and I had to try this place out.

So one day we came and this place was not very great, not bad either, but definitely nothing special.  Service was good, it was quick, and the staff was super friendly and attentive.  I ordered their Sun Devil Chicken combo thing and it was gross!!  It was not even spicy!!  It looked bland too.  That dish needs more colour, throw in some red bell peppers or carrots or something..  use dark meat add a little vinegar and sugar into the sauce.. something.. jalapeño alone and green onions can't do crap... anyways, ate one bite and got a big headache..  I had to box it up and gave it to my subordinate to feed his puppies it.  

Next day my subordinate said the puppies wouldn't eat it and decided to eat the cat food instead.  Overall great service, but the Sun Devil Chicken was gross, I'll never order that one again!  After thinking about it, I think I'm gonna go do a two in the loo.  Peace out yelpers!!  Deuces!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best Chinese restaurants you'll find in this area. They give you fat portions on such discounts. Come during their lunch special from 1230 to 5. They give you soup and after that they give you rice with your choice of chicken and egg roll and chips all for seven dollars. You can't find anything like this anywhere else.  And they have the best orange chicken. It's no Panda Express. It's full of chicken on the inside with authentic  sauce"}
{"text":"It was the blandest fried rice I'd ever eaten...and it cost me ten bucks."}
{"text":"The service was great, but not the food. It was the closest location to midwestern university so I decided to go here. Good china restaurant is a little bit farther, maybe  7 more mins drive ? But the food is wayyyyy better! Recommend going there instead if you are looking for good Chinese food."}
{"text":"This Chinese food is the best I have had so far and I have tried many Chinese places the service is amazing as well their half size soup is the standard large in most Chinese restaurants the only thing I don't like is you have to add white pepper salt and chile oil to make the hot and sour soup spicy I ordered the general tso chicken and they where able to do it non battered which is a plus for me because I have the gastric bypass can't have alot of deep fry all waiters waitresses and bussers have a smile this is something I see no where anymore amazing serving sizes perfect for price very genorous"}
{"text":"Damn, the hot and sour soup, the egg drop soup and the egg rolls were DELICIOUS!!!!

There were four of us and two ordered Kung Pao Chicken, and it was not traditional and did not have peanuts. It was just average tasting although the ingredients were quality ingredients. We had beef and broccoli and had requested it spicy, but it wasn't. Again, it was average. We also had the orange chicken. It had very good quality chicken and I guess it was what I would say was good enough, but it isn't the same as I'm used to and the chicken was not at all crispy as I expected it to be.

We thought the lunch specials were more expensive than most Chinese places for lunch, as ours were priced at $8.00 and $9.00. Yes, the egg roll is the size of a small burrito and the soup bowl is by far the biggest I've experienced so I guess it could be justified. 

The hot and sour soup was amazing!! The base flavor of the hot and sour soup was one of the best I have ever tasted! It was filled with so many ingredients and lots of chunks of dark meat chicken!! The egg drop soup was also filled with a variety of ingredients, including large chunks of white meat!! And the egg roll.....oh, the egg roll!!!

I'm going back for sure and I'm ordering up soup and egg rolls!!! That is where the gold lies in this place!!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is okay, nothing stellar but what put me off is that they refuse to drive one block away at lunch to do delivery. Really? If you're going to do delivery, and I know it's busy at lunch, but guess what, it's also an order! I took my business elsewhere who were more than glad to deliver my order. Don't say you're delivery if you're only delivery after 5pm."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I probably come here once a week. Their food is excellent, the staff is awesome and friendly, and their prices are great. I recommend the dumplings, crab puffs, Sun Devil Chicken and Chicken Chow Mein."}
{"text":"Best hot N sour soup I have probably had. Real egg rolls not tiny greasy full of wrapper like most places. Rice and entre very fresh and better than run of mill Chinese food joints. Lunch specials start at $8.00 but include hot tea and food quality and cleanliness was above the norm. Visiting area, will return."}
{"text":"Abacus, used to add subtract, multiple and divide. In this case, it's subtraction. The food was very bland, we ordered take out. Should be trash out. We've eaten a lot of Chinese takeout over the years. This is a place we won't order from again when in Glendale area.  My wife thought it was horrible.

Food we ordered: pupu platter for 2, hot & sour soup, House special chow mein, moo shu pork, orange beef (requested not spicy) total with tax $49 + change.

pupu platter: poop poop - egg rolls tasteless, bbq pork overcooked, flavorless chicken wings and drumettes, fried shrimp (neutral) crab puffs, (deflating)

Hot & Sour soup (afraid to try it for now, will prep myself to try it later)

House special chow mein, definitely not special, flavorless, and if you like thin tasteless linguine like noodles with a hint of diluted brown color sauce as flavoring, then you might like it.

Moo Shu Pork, sorry, should call it shoo shoo pork. go away go away.

Orange beef: not use to having orange beef that is breaded battered fried. In my book, placing an orange slice garnish on the food doesn't make it orange beef. Call it a day and call it a lemon. Let's hope my wife and I find a better place. We ordered from this place, based on Yelp reviews, proximity of where we're staying and didn't have a car to get around.

This take out food reminds me of Chinese food from the 1950's and 60s. My wife said you can't even call it Americanized, it's worse than that!!"}
{"text":"The crab puffs were good but their fried rice was weird and we tried the general tsos and sweet and sour chicken and it was not good at all."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery Saturday night which am always thankful for good food that delivers, it always takes a long time but usually worth it. We always order a couple things we love like the dumplings snd crab puffs and then experiment on different things, not a fan of the hoisin beef I learned this time and the chicken I ordered extra spicy wasn't spicy at all. The pork chow mein was yummy, but this time I was left wanting more. Worked our way threw most of the menu. We really enjoy it its on the edge of good and great"}
{"text":"Based on the reviews I was excited to try this place. It feel well short of good. I had the orange chicken lunch special and  @ $8.25 seemed a little high priced for lunch in a strip mall.  I tried the hot and sour soup- blah, I couldn't get past 3 spoonfuls. The orange chicken was dry on the inside but the sauce was okay, I ended up shoving the chicken to one side and just eating rice + sauce. One bite of the egg roll and I was done with that too - you can buy better crappy egg rolls in the freezer section at the grocery store, then let them sit outside in the heat for a day or two and serve them up and they would be better than that excuse for an egg roll.  

The plus side was they kept filling my water - which was needed to choke it all down. 

I will not return."}
{"text":"Don't be turned off by the strip mall location.  This place is cute on the inside, clean, and has above average food.  Prices are reasonable and portions are healthy.  Veggie fried rice to go is only $5 and easily feeds two healthy adults.

Service is fairly reliable and not a lot of kids here because it is a narrow dining area (if there are noisy kids, the whole restaurant will hear it)."}
{"text":"man these guys orange chicken is to die for way better then panda express this is top quality chicken and the sauce is amazing its like the willy wonka orange sauce of the future its amazing nothing can compare to it they even give you a orange slice on top what more can u ask for love it"}
{"text":"For Chinese food, THIS PLACE IS THE BOMB! It's not a fast food greasy take out joint!!! This is a little cozy spot, very low key but Oh man let me tell you the food is great! My kids get the beef broccoli and usually I'll get the sun devil chicken or the orange chicken with steamed rice, It's not over breaded and the meat is all white no skin! Soooooooooooooo yummy! Prices are super good too, very inexpensive meal! I promise! Abacus you rock!"}
{"text":"I've enjoyed eating here for years because of the good food and good value.  The last time I placed a take out order, though, the total was much higher than I expected.  I asked to go through each item and its price, and was shocked to see things that were $6 or $7 are now $9!  I thought maybe the sizes had changed, but the only explanation I was offered was that my menu was old.  It was so much more expensive than it had been that I won't be back.   My husband and I used to meet there for lunch because the specials were a great deal, but now they are $8 or $9 each.  So sad!"}
