{"text":"Great bagel place. The mushroom barley soup is outstanding. I can be very loud and busy around brunch on weekends. If you live in the Thornhill Woods area it's also a great place to bump into friends"}
{"text":"Bought the egg salad at the deli last week. It was expired and smelled funky the minute I opened the carton. It was $7 including tax for about 200 grams of product that already went expired. You can see they really care about the freshness of their products. The deli products don't even have a expiration date."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for Bagel World in Markham to open for awhile and I must say it was worth the wait. I went on a Sunday afternoon so it wasn't too busy. We were greeted and seated promptly and our server was over a couple minutes after that for drinks. The menu has a good variety of breakfast and lunch options. I went with a 3 egg omelette because I hadn't had breakfast; I opted to create my own with goat cheese, spinach, and bacon and it comes with home fries and a bagel all for just $11.99! My husband got the eggs benny with peameal bacon, home fries and a freshly squeezed orange juice (I just drink water) for $11.99 (food) & $4.99 (juice). All of it was delicious. Our food came out fast and piping hot. They are huuuge servings too! I could not finish my meal but I wish I could it was so yummy. My multigrain bagel was incredible, light and fluffy and toasted just right. We were also given a free sample of a raspberry strudel which must be something they're testing (it wasn't amazing but you can't argue with free). The decor is pretty sparse and the lighting a flat white,so while the ambience isn't quite cozy the food and service are excellent I plan to make this my go to breakfast restaurant."}
{"text":"The food this morning was sub-par. They are now using frozen and canned produce AND they increased their prices. We ordered pancakes and there was a hair in it. For that, the server apologized.  I used to really like this place, now I am doubting if I will go back."}
{"text":"Zero star if i could because of unbelievably poor service, don't support this kind of rude behavior! Walked in, half the place was closed but still could order. Asked for 2 cream cheese bagels and coffee. The older eastern European lady rolled her eyes and made it apparent that we were an inconvenience and walked away huffing and puffing. So we walked out. Horrible experience. 
Luckily next door at Opa! We had our order taken with a smile and were satisfied there."}
{"text":"Wow..where do we start.. Maybe we should lower our standards instead of being unpleasantly surprised every time by the service and food in some eateries... That was one of them. 
The service is slow. The waitress has a noticeable attitude issues. The food is very mediocre to say the least. It's a tough task to kill the eggs or omelette for anyone who can cook. This eatery managed to do it. Glad we didn't order waffles or pancakes. The roasted potatoes and \"homemade\" fries probably came from the same freezer. Whatever made those poor potatoes look yellowish orange, tastes really odd and off. One thing that should be excellent in \"bagel world \" is bagel,right? Meh, not really. Kiva, in comparison has the best bagels, twisters and other breads to offer. If I was an owner of this joint, I'd drive one morning to Kiva that is on Steels/Bathurst and taste what breakfast in a place like this should be. The one in Richmond Hill isn't too bad either by the way. This one is not on our list anymore. Nah, we are not coming back.."}
{"text":"Busy new spot taking the place of the greek grill in an aging plaza on Yonge St.
I've never visited the other locations so this was my first experience with the brand. Visiting on a very busy morning we were still afforded a seat by a very hands on owner/manager who was really expediting everything. 

The service was good and the food was definitely up to standard. Coffee was decent but the smoked eggs benedict was great and there were many enticing dishes coming out of the kitchen that I'll have to go back and try. There is also a patisserie that sells various baked good and fresh macaroons that are hard to come by up in Newmarket. Looking forward to my next visit to this breakfast place maybe on a quieter morning!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now with my girlfriend and both times we've gone our table had not been set with cutlery and we were not greeted by anyone immediately to provide us with a menu... 

On our latest visit we sat down without any direction from anyone (no one was there to offer any), we waited a while and then whom we suspected to be the owner came by and asked us what we wanted... I asked him for menus and he seemed surprised... So we get our menus, we order (cheese bagel is extra if you order an omelette - bit outrageous as this was not the case the first time I came here), the food comes, and we do not have cutlery (this happened on both visits to BagleWorld - \"Always a memorable experience\")... So we have to wait for someone to come back, the gentleman, again whom we suspect is the owner, comes back and asks if we need anything and my girlfriend asks for cutlery (she ordered oatmeal, I the omelette) and he brings her a gigantic serving spoon... So fed up at this point she decides to make a point and use the hilariously large spoon.

Case in point, the food is mediocre at best, the prices are high, the service is dismal, and the overall experience is definitely memorable - just for all the wrong reasons. My advice? Avoid this place like the plague."}
{"text":"Excellent, attentive service in the sit-down section. The place gets busy on weekends so be prepared to wait. My only complaint is the low quality, tasteless produce."}
{"text":"Two for lunch on Saturday. Busy spot! As they just recently opened there are visible rough spots to smooth. Lengthy wait to place an order but we were in good company and patient as the wait staff was obviously trying so hard. My daughter had sesame bagel, cream cheese and lox platter with vegetables rather than salad. She loved it! I had tuna platter with sesame bagel and vegetables. Very good and the portion size was perfect. We shared a half litre of orange juice which was delicious poured. 

I look forward to returning soon"}
{"text":"Service was EXTREMELY SLOW, negative star if i can give especially we ordered bagel with tuna, soup and bagel; it was over an hour wait.  I expected it would be packed on sunday but service that slow was unacceptable.
You will get 10% off at bakery when you dine in."}
{"text":"Awesome staff, great service, delish food. Its always busy.. which is great to see.

Love taking home bagels and store made cream cheese.

Recently had such a sweet server, she was helpful, talkative, and fun."}
{"text":"No idea how anyone can like this place.   The staff is rude and just downright nasty.  I went in there to buy some bagels and after waiting and watching as staff avoided approaching my area for 10 minutes,  an older eastern European woman approached me and looked at me as though I was wasting her time.  My wife has grain allergies so I began asking her the names of all the bagel baskets (they may want to label them).  She kept rolling her eyes at me and huffing and puffing.  The bagels are severely overpriced and the staff is just downright nasty.  I am never going there again.   Please avoid this place at all costs!"}
{"text":"I popped in here for lunch and, the service was so slow, I got back to work late.  They advertise for breakfast and lunch, but it doesn't work for someone on a time schedule!  The servers were ignoring me when I tried to ask for a takeaway container, so I had to wrap the rest of my food in napkins.  I asked about allergen information, and the server didn't know and made me embarrassed to have asked when she replied, \"I guess I can ask!\" and then went back to the kitchen.  They ended up calling the owners, who simply said they couldn't be held responsible since the food comes from somewhere else.

Finally, I ended up getting oatmeal for $5 (after opting away from 2 eggs for $6.50!)  I asked about allergens in that and got the same reaction.  \"I don't know... I guess I could check the packaging?\"

It wasn't even that busy!

My lunch companions said their food was good, but we all agreed the service (from the owners down to the servers) left much to be desired.  Will not be going back there."}
{"text":"A great place for a quick breakfast in Newmarket other than Cora's! Fresh and a huge portion - I ended up with the gluten-free bites - just ask as they are so accommodating!"}
{"text":"Always an amazing breakfast at Bagel World wth work friends.  

Two eggs, over medium, sausage, potatoes, and their incredible bagels.  Total kudos to the staff who are friendly, attentive and seem to know your order better then you do."}
{"text":"Food is very good. Coffee is good and served in what I feel is larger than average mug. Refills come standard. Staff excellent especially Jackie. There was no charge for smiles. 

You can sneak in a little ahead of the official posted opening time on weekdays. 

WARNING:- Stay away from their pastries counter. They're incredibly good but murder on the waist line."}
{"text":"I got a dozen of assorted bagel. Definitely a lot better than buying from the grocery stores. I also bought creme brulee and it was yummy as it is without the caramelized sugar on top. The lady even taught me how to caramelize it in the oven toaster."}
{"text":"This is my second time at the Newmarket Bagel Word location (it has been here for years now) and I don't know why I have not tried this place sooner! 
I got the Shakshuka and grilled veggie bagelini to share with a friend and both of them were to die for ! 
The Shakshuka is a poached egg in a delicious tomato sauce ( I hate tomato sauce so this says a lot) on a hot skillet and some home fries. I can probably eat this every time I come here. 
The grilled veggie bagelini was as equally amazing, and it even has goat cheese in it (my favorite!!!), I was so happy my friend and I were able to get both and share. To my knowledge most of the meals comes with an side of your choice (between garden salad and home fries)
Besides food that can make you salivate the servers are very nice and check up on you regularly (even on the busiest mornings)."}
{"text":"So I went to do some take out of yummy bagels but was a bit unsure of what exactly to get. One of the waitresses there probably noticed the confusion in me and as super helpful to suggest a bunch of different options.

Of course the bagels are awesome with the abundance of types of toppings etc. But omg the deserts were soooo good, highly suggest leaving with some sweets if ya got a case of the sweet tooth! Good service, fair prices, good food..... Check it out :)"}
{"text":"Not just a bagel joint, Bagel World serves full breakfasts.  And I mean good breakfasts!  I will usually test a place by ordering the Eggs Benedict, providing it is real Hollandaise sauce-not powdered pre-mix.

Bagel World didn't let me down.  The eggs were poached correctly, and the Hollandaise was excellent.  With a side of nicely seasoned home fries, it is a winner in my breakfast book.  Service is great, with servers that are attentive, with a bit of sass, just to keep me in line."}
{"text":"Garlic and dill cream cheese spread is amazing. Coffee is ok. Fresh bagels. Great service."}
{"text":"Was at Sunset Grill a few days ago and saw that Bagel World (located across the parking lot) served breakfast and lunch. I had assumed that it was a bakery that specialized in bagels, etc. so it piqued my interest when I saw their signage...so much so that I made a mental note to try next for breakfast.

When we arrived (2 of us), there were signs advertising a hot breakfast for $4.99...it included eggs, bacon, home fries and a bagel. A bottomless cup of coffee for $2 made the meal complete. For that price point, one would expect a smaller version of bkfst...but that's not the case.......and the bagel was huge ! The person I was with ordered this and was stuffed by the time he was finished.....but his plate was spotless save for a few home fries.

I ordered the French toast. They listed a \"crunchy\" French toast on the menu as well....so I inquired as to what the heck that was. French Toast rolled in corn flakes......not by cup of tea...so I went with just plain old French toast, dusted with icing sugar. They were good...not the best I've had...and the maple syrup was not REAL maple syrup....it was that Old Thyme table syrup you get almost anywhere. For an $8.50 price point, I was expecting more...so I was a bit disappointed. Oddly, I was expecting it to be on Challah bread...but it wasn't. However, one huge plus was that when I ordered a tea, I was brought a POT of tea....enough for 3-4 cuppas. Fantastic, as most places seem to forget us tea drinkers when offering refills to the coffee drinkers at a table.

Our waitress was friendly and attentive. The only issue with service was that it got fairly busy and she was the only person working the dining area...so our dirty plates sat in front if us a bit longer than what's considered a normal time frame. But she was around with coffee regularly and cleared some plates off as we were eating (the bagel came on its own plate)
 
When you get your bill, there's a coupon attached for 10% off in their on-site bakery. We wandered into it and the selection was not great. Might take off if more options were offered.

Menu was huge......will definitely go back and try something else."}
{"text":"Loved this place. The service was amazing, the food was great and it's clean and friendly. One of our favourite brunch spots in Newmarket."}
{"text":"This is a great little spot that just opened up in Markham. 

We made reservations, for a Sunday 9:30am for a breakfast for 8 people and while they have a take out counter, there is pretty good seating for anyone who wants to sit down for breakfast or lunch. (40-50 person capacity). 

The portions were generous and all of the food we ordered was fantastic. Price was good value for what was on offer, and the menu offered plenty of options for everyone. We ordered a variety of dished, from the Great Canadian Breakfast, to Pancakes, to a great dish one of us ordered, but we all tried and enjoyed called \"Shakshuka\", which was two eggs served over a skillet of warm tomatoes and veggies, (with optional feta or
goat cheese). It was very good. Strong recommend, (especially if your looking for something uncommon but tasty and filling).

The services was fast, and I was told (by others in our group) that the coffee was good. Orange Juice is freshly squeezed, and there is a full counter display of fresh pastries. Also notable is the Bagelinis, (Paninis on a Bagel), and Rainbow Bagels (you know. . . For the kids). 

Overall this is a great little spot for breakfast, lunch or brunch. Check it out! (We'll definitely be back)."}
{"text":"Great location. Very nice staff. You may have to wait a bit at times. 
Food is ok.  Great if you need something quick."}
{"text":"I went here while on the go for a bagel with lox cream cheese. It was delicious. 

Whenever I pass by the place, I remind whomever I am with to check it out. It doesn't look so appealing on the outside, but the inside is quaint and displays a ton of baked goods along with killer cream cheese. Sometimes Philidelphia cream cheese just doesn't cut it. This place reminds of \"the bagel stop\" which I have fond memories of. I fully recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great breakfast especially the $4.99 special. 2 extra large eggs, bacon or sausage a bagel and home fries! 

We also tried Bagel World for Lunch. The Philly steak was great. Good portion and great flavour. The Triple decker club was good as well. The chicken in the club was an actually grilled breast. Great value. Sandwiches were served with fries. Good bang for your buck. 

Will definitely be back! A refreshing change from the same old same old in the area."}
{"text":"Excellent lox and cream cheese on a sesame bagel. I will definitely come back! Great service and a very friendly atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  Although it is a francise I have memories of Bagel World from childhood with crazy eastern women screaming.  The bagels are excellent.  I really enjoy their salads and eggs there.  Coffee is ok, I've had better but it is drinkable. Husband had the oatmeal there yesterday and the portion was very large and the oatmeal was well made."}
{"text":"I went there on saturday for lunch and ordered the wrong salad by mistake.  I asked them to pack it up so I could take it home.  As i realized I wasn't going to eat it.. It was full of onions and cucumbers.  The manager came over right away and asked me if the salad was ok because I hadn't touched it.  I explained to him that I made a mistake and ordered the wrong salad.  So he said they would make up another salad no worries.  I was really impressed because it was my error and my problem but they bent over backwards to accomodate me.  The restaurant is nicely redone. They've put a lot money into it to redesign the space from when it was the Aegean Grill.  I think BagelWorld is going to do well in Newmarket."}
{"text":"Well I wasnt expecting this place in the Petsmart/foodbasics plaza! Its great for the people living in the area to have a breakfast place within earshot distance. Before walking in, I thought it was just a small walk-in startup establishment where you grab food and go. So because I want to support local business, I went in to give it a try. Well it turns out its a mid-sized sit down restaurant. Bagel World is a company that has been around for a little while and now they have made their debut in Markham.

Walking in, the area is very spacious, perhaps too much. The ceilings are very high, the lights are blueish and the walls are white. Its pretty plain jane and it isn't very warm and welcoming. It doesnt make you want to sit down, take off your coat and have conversation, but rather just keep your coat on, eat and leave. However...I usually consider both sides. It is a new location for them so maybe they have plans to fix up this commercialized unit into something more homey-feeling. 

They do have decent prices on their food though. You cannot beat $4.99 for a breakfast that includes two eggs, homefries, 3 bacon or sausage and a bagel. At first when I saw it I was like WHAT IS THIS...I AM NOT PAYING $12 FOR THIS (the usual price of a breakfast), then I remembered again that it was $4.99. Incredible value for the food you get. I was actually full by the end. 

About the breakfast:
The eggs are large and so the two that they serve is enough. I was not too big a fan of the bacon though as the pieces were flat and seemed unfresh. Usually if bacon is fresh you can tell. The homefries was the star of the meal. They tasted similar to a sour cream and onion chip so that was pretty tasty. Lastly, the bagel I had was OK..not oustanding like you would expect from a place called \"bagel world\", but atleast it wasn't stale or anything. 

So, in the end, I received a $15.00 bill for two breakfasts and two refillable coffees...like whaaat? Friends, if you would like a value meal for breakfast, try out bagel world. 

OH, its also worth mentioning that they make all kinds of other breakfast/brunch foods. Pancakes, sandwhiches, soups etc."}
{"text":"Bakery: 
Overpriced, the bagels and other baked goods are not as fresh as other nearby bakeries and the service can use a lot of shake up!

The Restaurant: 
Good and Kind Service (a little less on the weekends) and the Food is mostly good, I would recommend their Salmon (Platter or a the sandwich) and the Shakshuka. The coffee is basic and not espresso based which for some might be a disadvantage."}
{"text":"Bagel World's weekday before 11 am for $4.99 is the best breakfast deal in the area!

For $4.99
- 2 large eggs 
- bacon or sausage
- home fries
- choice of bagels! (love their selection of freshly house baked bagels!)

Cook when order, the food was fresh without the greasy oily taste. Of course I love my bagel!!

Though there was only 1 waitress working but she is fast and efficient.

Coffee/Tea is $2 bottomless. Freshly brewed perfect to jump start your morning!

I haven't try other items on the menu but from the quality of breakfast special, it is worth coming back!"}
