{"text":"I really liked this place, the food is very similar to applebee's or chilli's but I liked the food and atmosphere here a little better.  The portions were huge and the prices were dirt cheap."}
{"text":"Stopped in on Sunday to watch some football.  First time here, and we'll definitely be back.  The place itself has a great mix of patio as well as indoor/outdoor lighting.  Lots of different seating options, so that you can choose what is most comfortable to you, but all near a TV.  Great drink prices, not your usual weak pour that accompanies such prices, and our waitress was great.  She had the perfect balance of never making you wait, but also not hovering/making you feel pressured to hurry and order more.  That made us feel comfortable hanging out, stay longer/order more, and want to go back.  How come everyone doesn't get it?  We didn't eat, but the menu looked great. We can't wait to go back, try the food, and whatever that fun looking game thingy is on the side."}
{"text":"Our softball team usually goes here after the games on Monday nights and I love it here. Good specials during the nights, has shuffleboard and pool to keep you entertained . Plus, the waitresses are very good looking so that's a bonus! Only bad thing is that the food can come at a slow pace sometimes. There are TVs everywhere so it doesn't matter where you sit, you will always have a view at a good TV."}
{"text":"It's aright, if I can't get one of those big chairs at the bar, I'll go somewhere else. I do have to say they for bar food, you get quite a bit of food, but it's only good after a few beers if you know what I'm saying."}
{"text":"I had to go here for a job-related event. I don't normally drink alcohol near my workplace (have to get home), but they don't card people who aren't drinking and have a nice atmosphere. Good place to hang out with the co-workers."}
{"text":"The staff wasn't very friendly. They weren't rude, they just came off as if they were waiting till it was time to go home.   I ordered the fish and chips and I have to say, it was the greasiest fish I've ever had. I literally had to soak up the oil off the fish with a napkin. Something I would expect from a home meal. Not from a place where somebody cooks for a living.   I was also charged twice on my card for two different amounts. I was with a friend, but we had two separate bills and two separate cards. I'm sure they will take care of it but I'm not sure how that happened in the first place. Probably from the staff members who seemed to have other things going on other than taking care of their patrons."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place zero stars. To begin, they have the Arizona lake in their parking lot which poses as not only a safety hazard, but also an inconvenience for all customers. We went there the other night hoping to have some fun with our friends however we never even made it into the bar because of this lake they have in the parking lot and the rude customers this bar attracts. One of our friends slipped in mud walking in and while we were standing their helping her clean her foot and shoes, an asshole decided to speed through the puddle, probably finding it hilarious, and splashed us all leaving us soaked and covered in mud. My phone was ruined with water damage. We went to the front demanding to speak to the manager or someone on charge for the night, explaining the situation, and he laughed. We asked again to please get a manger, simply because that puddle needed to be taken care of immediately so this would not happen to other customers and to recommend they have security of some sort patrolling the parking lot because no one should be reaching speeds like this guy in the truck did. This is simply for safety precautions of the future. However, the kid checking IDs at the front refused to get a manager and we stood there waiting for 20 minutes, asking again if he was going to get the manager.  The fact that the management has completely over looked this reflects a complete disregard for customers and their safety and the lack of respect this business exhibits.  I will never be returning nor recommending this place to any of my friends."}
{"text":"I've only gone during the week at lunch hour, but this medium-sized sports bar has a lot of food and drink specials.  Their wings are pretty good. Definitely above average. The medium wings are crispy and had just right amount of sauce. The sauce itself is more mild than hot, however their hot is definitely very hot! Out of the dozen, a couple of them came out dry.  The street tacos, $1 on Tuesdays, come with crumbly cotija cheese, cabbage, and a creamy cilantro sauce. The chicken was well-seasoned and were great. Very tasty. The shredded carnitas were very good but a couple of them came out dry. The steak seemed unseasoned and just didn't taste very good.  The burgers were just okay and the sliders are barely the size of a silver dollar. In both cases they seemed to be under-seasoned.  The pizza comes on a crispy crust and an underwhelming marinara sauce. And the cheese...I just didn't like. It definitely changed in flavor when the couple of slices I took back were reheated 4-5 hours later.  Service is spotty. It will go from friendly and prompt to almost non-existent depending on the day.  There are TVs all over the place but some are up really high and only of the 17\"/19\" variety. I'll have to try this place out when a big game is on."}
{"text":"Love this place! They make great long island ice tea (my favorite!) and have great prices."}
{"text":"Ask for Veronica (I think her name is?) Great service and very beautiful girl. Was very helpful with menu and had great energy. Highly reccommend the pizza."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever had there tonight. Took one 20 min for a drink and over an hour to get food. The restaurant wasn't even busy. Took out waitress even took 20 min just to come greet us. Ordered the queso dip and it was not warm at all, it was lukewarm at best."}
{"text":"Haven't even had my order taken. 20 minutes since waitress told us she would go get a pen. Terrible service. She was the only waitress around since we got here. Finally a different waitress came and then told me I couldn't have all three meats on my sliders! Well policy is policy. But dang."}
{"text":"This place is good for meeting people for happy hour or going out with a group. Drinks range from cheap to reasonable in price and they have a good selection of beers and liquor (tough luck if you have high-class wine taste). If you're hungry, they have a good-sized menu that's much better than your average bar fare.  On a side note, this place is great for day drinking: $1 Bud/Miller/Coors Lights before 4:00."}
{"text":"So bad it's almost embarrassing to comment on. I have lived next door to this place for almost two years now and each visit only reinforces my previous judgements of how bad it truly is. I have giving this place it's fair shot now over 10 visits - the most recent being the worst... If you get a table away from the bar good luck seeing your server more than once an hour. If you feel the bar is better suited you're in for another rude surprise as well as the service there is equally as bad. It's truly a shame. Such a good location and venue wasted away by poor staff and management. The only real appeal left to this place is it's two for one specials on Thursdays... but to take full advantage you better know at least some of the staff on a first name basis..."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place because the girl was so nice over the phone when I asked if I could bring my dog to the patio. For the place not being all that busy the service was horribly slow. My poor dog and I waited an obscene amount of time on the hot patio for water and beer respectively - we're talking 30+ minutes. Can't comment too much on the food because by the time we finally got our appetizer of chips and guac (which wasn't horrible, but not great) we decided to head elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great bar, just plain great.  I know 5 stars shouldn't be used carelessly but I think this place deserves it!  It's a sports bar with a bunch of TV's but doesn't 'feel' like one.  Read on....  First off, it's clean.  For a bar that's down the street from a huge university (ASU), that's not an easy thing to maintain.  Clean facilities, tables, floors, glasses, etc....and we were there when it was pretty packed.  Second; our server was fantastic!  She was very nice, attentive and it didn't hurt that she was a little cutie.  She always made sure we had beers and kept checking on us through the night.  Third; food was really good.  The pizza was really, really good.  Like Italian restaurant good.  I was impressed with that fact alone.  And lastly, if you like Guinness like I do, this place served it right and it tasted great!"}
{"text":"I am sure it's great for drinks only, but the food was not good. The place was empty and that should have been a clue because other places nearby seemed busy. The beer glass was dirty and the food had little to no flavor. I had a wrap and my fiance had a philly. 2 hours later he was sick. I don't think we will be going back."}
{"text":"Don't go here before ASU games. Coors light is $4!! WTF.  The food is meh at best. The servers are nice though. So I guess one out of three ain't too bad. Or not.     P.s not good about putting college football games on."}
{"text":"ALL DRINKS at 1/2 price during happy hour 4-7p. appetizers as well.   first couple times around id say the food takes a passenger seat to zipps. for instance the 'sundevil gold' wings are similar to zipps 'golden' but just doesnt have that same bite, ya know. but still a lot to try. and there is not a zipps in tempe, so this is probably the next best thing.  2-3 times the draft selection as zipps as well. pacifico on draft is nice! daily (outside hh) food/drink specials to browse on the website  outdoor patio is probably nice but havent had the chance to chill out there.  a pool table and shuffleboard, tvs, etc, etc.. a fair amount of co-eds to gawk at too. ill return."}
{"text":"I would go back to your restaurant because of the ambiance and location.... But I was indirectly insulted by the server assigned to mine and my husbands table..... I manage a restaurant and I would not disrespect any of our clients.... You have to train your servers  that if its a couple especially a man & a Woman.... they have to at least ask the woman and serve the woman first... I don't know if your server is doing the trick to serve the guy first because they would tip more... ...IThere're a lot of reasons I can think of, of why she did such a move--- putting the appetizers way on the side of my husband,,, in front of him... What was I???--- Table was empty except for our drinks... So what was her reason..... to all the lady servers... you don't know who handles the checkbook   :)  So my advise is to just plain respect the woman if they are with a man..... I would have tipped more but I still gave the right amount of tip........"}
{"text":"Nice seating to accommodate you & a great bar. Awesome vibes,very friendly,welcoming, and fast. I ordered the jalapeño burger which was absolutely perfect. I'd recommend this location for a nice laid back evening with friends."}
{"text":"Second to last day in Arizona came to this bar on a Thursday and I swear I felt like a star!  Dope experience, everyone was so receptive and just wanted to have a good time. The women... oh my gosh. They were absolutely stunning!  They weren't trying to \"curve\" or make anyone feel beneath them, it was just a night of good vibes and everyone having a memorable experience.  I'll be back here for sure when I'm back in AZ."}
{"text":"My opinion of this establishment has changed greatly in the last few months. I've visited about 5-6 times in the last year and every time I go things seem to be getting worse. It's hard to tell where the real problem is, mainly because there are so many.  First, I think a big problem in this place is the food. The food specials are cheap ($5), but so is the quality. Every time I go in, it's difficult to know what the quality of the food will be like. I used to love their burgers, but as of late, they have been really overcooked and bland. The wings tend to be either overcooked or oversauced. Thier pizza's are just plain bad (no flavor).  Second, I think the staff is pretty cordial especially when you come in, but as time progresses, they have a tendency to make you feel rushed; especially if they are busy. Sometimes I like to just have a couple of drinks and watch the game. The second you stop drinking is when you should watch out. I actually was approached by someone that I think was a manager who basically made me feel as though I would need to either keep drinking or give up my table.  Third, I agree with others when they say that this place is kind of loud; especially at night. During the day time, it's usually pretty calm, but mainly because most days it's empty before happy hour.  On the brighter side, you can drink here pretty cheap and can always expect a heavy poor especially from certain bartenders. Monica is always one of the people to pour a nice stiff drink; sometimes with only a splash of the mixer. Don't waste your money ordering doubles, you get that and then some in most of your drinks.  In Tempe bars are a dime a dozen, and I just don't see myself making this my regular hang out spot unless it makes some serious improvements."}
{"text":"Food's not bad, they have good drink specials too. Busiest night is definitely on Thursday nights when they have the two-for-one drink special. Only reason why I had to go 3 stars is cause the waitresses have overcharged me on drinks multiple times on Thursday nights. And when you try to confront them about it they get really bitchy cause it's always busy."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years I love the staff Brian Lauren sky kam and James in the kitchen always make me feel like family I highly recommend coming here for great food great service and amazing drinks"}
{"text":"My go to bar in college and still one of my favorite spots.  Everyone knows of the infamous Thursdays nights and gameday madness that makes Devils Advocate the go to college bar but I have a new found love for this bar as my go to lunch spot! By far the BEST lunch happy hour I have come across! Buy one get one burgers, $1 tacos, BOGO pizzas, and $1 domestic pints. All the food is awesome especially the tacos, and a cold beer is a great addition to the work day. Adam, the manager, always makes us feel welcome and typically the bartending/waiting staff is quick and friendly.  If you don't like crowds avoid Thursday nights, especially during school.   Keep it up DA!"}
{"text":"My girl Veronica is the best bartender/server I have ever had in my life. I was in last Tuesday and she was most welcoming person and overall great person I have ever had in the hospitality industry. She made me want to come back and live it up at Devils Advocate!"}
{"text":"This place was really cool and I loved going. I THOUGHT it was buy 1, get 1 drinks but appreantly not. I asked for 2  Bud Lights thinking because of the deal I would get 4 but I got 2 and was charged $4.50. IDk"}
{"text":"Had a great grilled chicken sandwich, my eyes where bigger than my stomach. I like the atmosphere & all of the quotes on the wall."}
{"text":"I am an advocate for Devil's Advocate!  This place has everything. Amazing specials on food and drinks every single day, plus they are Arizona State themed. It is the best place to be on game day for the excitement and camaraderie of fellow Sun Devil fans.  This bar recently sponsored my boyfriend's adult hockey league, and I'm sure our group of friends brings in half of their business; not because the place is dead, but because we're there for days/nights a week.  If you're looking for a place to get rowdy and yell at the TV, this is it. If you're looking for delicious and down to earth bar food and cheap but tasty drinks, hit the patio for lunch and enjoy the weather. If you're looking for a place to call yours, this is it.  Devil's has it all!"}
{"text":"love this place great happy hour and friendly staff and perfect to watch sports"}
{"text":"Well, I think bartenders should be bartenders, most of the time patrons at the bar get neglected, they ran out of wings on Sunday lunch time $5 dollar special on football season, that's a No! NO! On my book, bartenders, touch their hairs, mouth, back for sweat, yuk! And touch appetizer plates and glasses after that's cross contaminations, other than that when we moved to the table service was better and food was good."}
{"text":"Great specials. Shit staff. The managers and cooks are cool. The wait staff are supremely fucktarded. I've literally sat at the bar for 20 minutes while a bartender complained about how hungover she was, while failing to serve me and 4 other customers around. The same chick overcharges drink orders regularly. The place smells like ass and the bathrooms are terrible. Fix the staff and maybe I'll come back. Shit tier service. Updated 2017, same shit years later."}
{"text":"Tacos are pretty good, but I wouldn't pay the regular price for them.  Taco Tuesdays where each taco is $1 is definitely worth the trip.  The atmosphere is cool as its full of a younger college crowd."}
{"text":"The food at Devils is surprisingly really good, defiantly surprised at the quality they had to offer. Although the service wasn't the best I've seen (as previous reviewers stated) their food and fun bar atmosphere definitely make up for it. Will absolutely be returning to devils this Sunday to watch the games!"}
{"text":"I actually like this bar, but if you decide to come on Tuesday, beware of the bartender, Veronica.  She's unbelievably rude...like ridiculously rude and will complete ignore you.  Fair warning"}
{"text":"Good food, great drink deals, and will be a poppin' spot when school starts"}
{"text":"I really struggled wanting to give this place a 4. Their tacos are AMAZING (Taco Tuesdays!!!), pizza is great, and great drinks and prices.  Their service is TERRIBLE. It is not uncommon to not see your waitress for 20+ minutes, and forget about getting your drinks refilled.  Even with the terrible service this place has become a regular spot for the food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Skyler gives the BEST service every time I'm there!! She remembers my order and checks in regularly to make sure I'm set! 10/10 would recommend!"}
{"text":"Comfortable chairs, plenty of room, NO COVER for UFC's. This place is good."}
{"text":"Always enjoy visiting especially open Mic to hear my Son play. The food is always good. However, the service outside is less than desirable. In fact it is down right bad. Every time the servers come outside, which is not frequent they walk by my table & never recognize us. At least say hello & I'll check back. I've worked customer service in banking & Home Depot for over 40 years & always prided myself on giving great customer service. The two female servers from Tuesday night, Aug. 29 definitely need more training on customer service, recognizing customers & saying hello to every customer that is outside. My son finally went inside to place our order & then it took 40 minutes for the food to arrive. All in all I rate the outside service a minus 1 & overall a 3."}
{"text":"This place was good over the summer but I'm sure what happened tonight! I went in with my son and a friend and we walked in the front door seen several servers just standing around so we sat ourselves on the outside patio. It's 6:40pm at the time we take our table \"they are slightly busy\" and we are hoping for a server to come over however; a group of 5 walk right in and get served. So we wait another 5 minutes  hoping to get served granted they are getting busy ...now it's 7pm we waited 20 minutes to get one server who was amazing but still took 20 minutes because the other girls that were to help on the patio didn't think we were good to be served. So to fast forward we ordered the chips and guacamole on the happy hour menu only to have my friend grab a bit and low and behold there is a Thumb tack that she bit on while eating \"granted this is the first scoop of the guacamole\" we proceed to let our server know Immediately and ask for the manager on duty. Well the manager comes out and we let her know about the thumb tack and she proceeds to answer with \" I'm not sure how that got in there since we don't use them in or at our store\"..... welll ummmmm look it's right here in your face so next! However what went from a place that I did a recommend I will not anymore just due to the comment the manger said. I'm saddened by this but it Could have been worse if my son had the chips and guacamole first. They did comp what we ordered and we stilled tipped our waitress 20% because it wasn't her fault but just double check your food if you do plan on going to this establishment."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great wings. Happy hour has a great beer special and staff is very good."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Devils for over 2 years on Thursday and every UFC fight. It saddens me to give a terrible review to one of my regular bars.   A couple of us went to the bar for the Mcgregor Mayweather fight. We took to the patio where our server was Riley with the red hair. She was absolutely terrible! She refused to do individual bills, and it was impossible to get her. I understand it was packed and there are other customers, but when I order a water cup at 6 pm and never got it, like that is insane! I had to go to the bar consistently to get a cup of water.  I wish that was the only problem. Our group had to haul down other waitresses and back boys to get her, where she took forever to come serve our table! Now she did sort of well bringing our drinks after it took an hour to get her. She was an extremely rude waitress and was appalling over all. Gratuity is suppose to represent how well the server served the table. Riley complained to our faces as well as other customers about the poor tip when the service was terrible. Afterwards, she complained to the bouncer with the hat in which the bouncer said \"get the f*** out for tipping bad.\" The bar has a right to refuse customers, but to kick out customers for tipping poorly? Under what law of Arizona does a bar kick you out for tipping poorly? Under what law of Arizona do I have to tip a terrible waitress! The bouncer was just extremely rude.  The audacity to complain about the tip after your service is insane. I personally feel you got lucky to even get a tip.   So thank you Riley the terrible waitress and the idiot bouncer with the hat for ruining one of our favorite places to eat and drink! Riley should give her tips to the back boys and other waitresses for that terrible service."}
{"text":"Loved the chicken strips! Best I've ever had!!!! Will be back for sure! Great happy hour too!"}
{"text":"OK, Devil's Advocate Bar & Grill is a package. You get the combination of a studenticos hangout bar, and a sports bar. And it works.   I came in and sat at the bar, ordered a beer and some wings. Actually, I ordered alot of wings. They showed up quickly and they were excellent. I say again, the wings are excellent. The service is a little confusing, because I was never serviced by the same person twice - but the personnel is polite and quick.   The only negative I can say is that it was loud in here, very loud. Maybe because of the football game that was on - but even so a little too loud for any kind of natural conversation.   Summary.  Its nice, clean and have a good atmosphere. The wings are rockin' and the service is great. I will be a return customer.  .. und das ist nach der kritiker."}
{"text":"Thursday night was my first and last time going to devil's advocate Bar and Grill. I met up with some friends to get drinks on a 2for1 night (which was dope!), The atmosphere was just as good as the drink specials. My issue was with the staff. After the bar closed at 2AM, one of the bouncers/security-guys got into an argument with a gentleman that was a little too intoxicated. One of the security guys kept escalating the situation and right as the cops were rolling up to check out the commotion, the security decided to take it a step further and tell the drunk man to \"get the fuck out of here you fucking nigger!\" I know that doesn't represent your business as a whole, but the other security guys seemed pretty chill with him blurting that out while everyone else around shook their head in dismay. As a black man, I'm not going to spend my  money at a business that hires scum like that. It's college town and the crowd was pretty diverse that night I was there with hip hop being played as well. There's no reason to have people working at your establishment,  that are supposed to act in a professional manner, calling people racial slurs. This was on Thursday 1/12 (technically 1/13 since it was 2AM)."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely AMAZING! The food taste great and you get huge portions and the prices are lower than most places. It is very clean and has a comforting layout. It gets pretty packed at night with all of the ASU kids, so I enjoy going there for lunch or an early dinner so i can beat the crowd. They also have great drink specials and daily food specials as well. Overall, AWESOME place!"}
{"text":"This place will always hold a special place in my heart. This is the only Sundevil themed bar in the valley and is at the heart of Tempe. Thursday nights are 2 for 1. When school is in session this place is packed with undergrads and students. Since Mill is dead on these night, it's a pleasant escape from the fist bumping madness. I love mill more than I care to admit, but this place allows you to see a familiar face and have a legitimate conversation. A seemingly impossible task on mill or in old town. Long after graduating I have come to this place and never fail to see someone I know. This place is an icon in the ASU community."}
{"text":"This place has a pretty good, $1 taco Tuesday, other than they don't have a fish option. It also has a generally upbeat, friendly vibe, but I'm dropping my review score to 3 because...  I bought 2 drinks for me and a friend, which cost $10. To pay for it, I gave her $21 and she never gave me any chance. 15 minutes later, I asked for it and she said she didn't know and thought I'd ask for my $10 if I wanted it back. I consider that a theft attempt.  However, the bartender Veronica rocks."}
{"text":"Great daily specials on food and drinks. A place to hang out where you'll see quite a few of the ASU athletes hanging out too. Hard to beat the atmosphere for any ASU fans looking to get their drink and eat on. Tons of TVs, the outdoor patio is great on cool evenings, and a variety of places to sit whether at the bar, a back corner table, out on the patio, or a high top table."}
{"text":"Dont go here if you want service. The servers are impossible to get service from. & when I did finally order I waited an hour and a half for nachos just to hear that \"They gave my order away to another table\".Wait another 30 mins.... finally get my order. & then when the bill comes not even comped or discounted."}
{"text":"I made a conscious decision to go to the DA immediately following my review... I conquered the Hangover burger...3 patties, 3 cheeses, an onion ring, and a fried egg with bacon...YUMMMM  and if you go Mondays its BOGO burgers!!!!! Daily specials...pool...shuffle board... I'm on my way!!!"}
{"text":"So I come to the DA about once a week on Wednesday's for trivia. Our team usually takes it and with that, you get a $20 gift card, so Ive tried a lot on the menu here.  Sometimes, they have good servers, other times you'll be lucky to get service within a half an hour. Their tator tots are usually good. They give you free refills on juice if you're not a big drinker and their pizzas are usually pretty good. I also like their Frisco Burger. That being said, the food here is usually super greasy to the point of god why did I eat that. Again there's exceptions, but most of the wraps are just kinda meh. If you order a Cobb Salad - good god its the size of a toddler's head, its good but jeez louise its massive. Hard to have conversations here sometimes because of how loud it is, but it is neighborhood-y and doesnt feel like a chain, so hazzah for ambiance.  Final verdict: ordering a pizza is your best bet, the Hawaiian and Spinach pizzas are the best ones, the high top chairs can sometimes be uncomfortable and the tables wobble a lot. Peace out."}
{"text":"Great bar, great staff, great food. Games are always on. Pool table is the right color. It's like Cheers only way more popular. :)"}
{"text":"I absolutely used to love coming to this bar,especially after a long day of school and work.I had walked in with four of my friends on Thursday night,and it was around 1130,the place was packed as usual on a Thursday night and I had finally found an open area at the bar,I was waiting for a good ten minutes for a bartender to notice me so I could buy a drink,when a tall red headed girl which was a bartender came up from behind me and my other friends,and literally PUSHED us out of the way,and normally I really don't acknowledge when that happens because it's a crowded bar and that is bound to happen,but it was so rude.I immediately ignored it and waited until she left so I could get my spot back,And then I got shoved by another person on my left side and I was shoving into her by accident..this bartender immediately turned around and cursed me out in front of a lot of people,and she just kept saying \" this is my fucking well,I fucking work here,get the fuck out of here\" and then security came up to me and immediately said \" you're done,get out\" Needless to say,I will never return here,and my friends won't either.I was in for ten minutes,just to get kicked out because a bartender/server decided to push me,and then curse in my face when I was trying to get my spot back.I really hope no other bartender treats people this way,I'm a server so I would never in my right mind would curse at someone the way she cursed at me in front of a lot of people."}
{"text":"Collage bar w a good vibe, adequate seating and lots if alcohol. Wings are good, the blue cheese is bomb..."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of this place. This is one of my go-tos in the North Tempe area.   Happy Hour: Their happy hour is pretty good, getting a 4/5. They do 1/2 off all drinks and appetizers 4-7pm on weeknights. There are also pretty good daily specials such as Taco Tuesday and Pizza...Thursday? Regardless, their food is pretty good for the price and their bartenders do not skimp on the liquor in well drinks, regardless of whether it's happy hour. Thursdays beginning at 9 is buy one get one all well drinks, too.  The service is okay, but you can't be TOO expectant since they usually seem staffed pretty thin and the place is pretty much always busy. The staff is attentive, though, however infrequent they may be able to get to your table.  The ambience is awesome. They have leather armchairs at the bar and the entire place is done in wood and bookshelves. Its mostly a sports bar, but it's also a great college hangout spot. I've had some great nights here.  When it's cold, they have heaters out on the patio along with two fire pits in a seating area/lounge. They allow smoking outside on the patio too."}
{"text":"Great spot to socialize and grab few drinks. Best days to come are Thursdays since they have 2x1 promotions.  Mainly customers are ASU students (as the name implies). Comfortable place to hang out with friends.  Food here is good. (For bar food). Quesadillas with your meat choice are the bomb though."}
{"text":"I love coming here on my days off especially because the atmosphere is comfortable. Andy always takes good care of me as well as Johnny they make my drinks how I like it. I keep coming back for the enjoyment of the staff they communicate like no other place I've been too. Usually other places try to have a conversation with you when they drop off the check however these guys talk to you the entire time while you enjoy your drink. Good vibes should be passed around so come on in and ask for these two fellas and you can't forget SKY! Nice guy and takes good care of his guests! Two thumbs up"}
{"text":"Decent happy hour. Great atmosphere. Draught beer could definitely be colder. Icy mug would help"}
{"text":"Cool Sports Bar but the food was sub-par and Bland. Loved the Bloody Mary Bar but would not eat there again."}
{"text":"I moved to Tempe almost two years ago and after discovering Devil's about a couple months in this bar/grill has become my favorite spot to relax and hangout with friends and family bar none! I have a keen eye for  quality of restaurants as I myself have worked in the food service industry coming up on ten years in serving positions and management. The  staff at Devil's Advocate is amazingly friendly and attentive. I've never had a wrong food order come out and never have been dissapointed with the quality or taste of the food. Their happy hour prices are UNRIVALED and they always pour a strong drink.   In addition to the exceptional prices, atmosphere, and staff they have every sports game you can imagine available to enjoy on their tvs located anywhere your eye can wonder inside and on the patio. They have strong misters on the patio as well to keep you cool in the unforgiving AZ sun. Ive been here 20+ times and have never been let down. If you have never been in to Devil's stop reading this review and get down there asap! (:"}
{"text":"Loved the name of this place, so i needed to investigate another happy hour. This HH goes til 7 with 1/2 price beer and a food specials menu consisting mostly of bar stuff. The $2 pretzel was killer; hot and buttery and had a decent queso dip on side. Not the same luck on the $4 street tacos. The chicken is thigh meat and the steak had no resemblence to steak or carne asada and the tacos were loaded with too much sauce and cheap cabbage. Pretty average beer selection and not all seats at the bar can view the tv screens. Nice patio though and there was one pizza with potatoes that looked unique that i need to try on next visit.  Not packed at all for monday night football."}
{"text":"Typical college sports bar. I like the casual environment here and of course the nice sized patio. I'm always in search of a good patio bar for people watching. Food is so so and services are hit and miss. I will be back for hanging out."}
{"text":"My favorite sports bar ever!  They have good deals and specials every night of the week.  Tacos on Tuesdays, pizzas on Wednesdays. 2-4-1 drinks on Thursdays 8pm-1am (my favorite), etc.  Happy hour 4-7 with 1/2 off all apps and drinks.  Huge bar area to get serves fast, nice patio, flat screens everywhere, shuffle board, and pool.  My only complaint is that they need larger bathrooms with more stalls; the lines get ridiculous on busy nights."}
{"text":"Good beer deals. Great game day bar with plenty of TVs and good music. Ordered the beer battered chicken strips and got them dipped in Mango Habanero sauce. Fries are great!"}
{"text":"Best. Bar. Ever. Their happy hour has a generous hour range and their prices are very good. Lunch hour prices are also amazing. The place has tons of tvs to watch the game, it's not very busy but the service is just so-so.  I've started going here regularly, it's probably my favorite bar."}
{"text":"This place is simply the BEST sports bar in Tempe if not Arizona! Great food, great drinks, great deals and most importantly great service!"}
{"text":"The bar tenders are rude. Went here with a few friends to day drink and they charged us for all the drinks that they messed up and did not make properly after telling us its on the house cause it was our bad. The food here is ok made my friend have food poising from chicken figures.. go figure."}
{"text":"Came in for taco tuesday with my buddy, tonight was more relaxed than i have seen before, normally its very packed.  It has a chill atmosphere and great reverese happy hour and some tastey tacos.  Veronica always remembers us by name. We will definitely keep coming back for taco tuesday."}
{"text":"Typical college area bar. Very casual atmosphere with lots of TV screens and loud music; don't expect to be able to have a conversation here without shouting. Service is friendly, parking is good, the drinks are OK. I ordered beef tacos, vegetarian tacos, and nachos with steak -- all were loaded with grease, and the tacos were borderline palatable. My suggestion: come here for enjoying company and having drinks, but if you are hungry, eat before coming here."}
{"text":"Great place to chill. Watch the game. Great beer. Dancing. Dinning.  Lots of fun. Good food. Burgers. Wings."}
{"text":"I love DA, the tacos on Tuesdays are some of the best in Tempe and the drink specials can't be beat! Whether it's to catch an NFL game or catch up with my girlfriends, I love coming to DA for a drink."}
{"text":"Talk about atmosphere! Perfect place for people of all ages to enjoy! Great happy hour special! Definitely worth a stop"}
{"text":"I've always wanted to stop in here but never got the chance. I finally checked it out last night after work. They always have something going on here. Wednesday they have karaoke and Sunday they have trivia. Thursdays are two for one drinks and its packed. They also have drink specials every day. We were starving so we ordered a pizza, burger, and wings (the wings were $5 on Sunday). It was all delicious but way too much food. We ended up taking at least half of it home. The service was great. The bartender had great suggestions and was on top of things without being annoying. We are looking forward to going here again for karaoke or trivia!"}
{"text":"This spot is going down as hit and miss. They hit on the HH drink prices which go until 7pm Monday - Friday, half priced drinks, all drinks, and their reverse happy hour many days offer buy one get one drinks. The food here is on the miss side of the coin. They have a full menu of burgers, fries, sandwiches, etc. but their tacos here are mostly the only food I've had. I think I've had a fried something or other at one point or another and likely an order of wings; but again the food isn't why I visit. This spot is fairly busy all the time, again, think drink prices; those cheap drinks really keep this place in business. They do have a Taco Tuesday special on tacos, but I think there *might* be better places out there for tacos. Drinks are not amazing, you won't find anything special or exceptional, but you can't mess up a beer or an alcohol with a diet coke mixer, well, you can, but it's pretty difficult. Take this spot for what it is, a hang out and grab a drink, I like the atmosphere though!  Happy Yelping."}
{"text":"Had devils Advocate for the first time tonight. If there was a way to give this business no stars I would. Food is way undercooked and the chicken wings were raw on the inside. Same with the chicken strips. This place is poor quality and should be concerned about making it's customers sick. Very disappointed in this place and was excited to try a new place in Tempe. With so many options in Tempe please do yourself a favor and skip this place. Horrible food. Don't waste your money at this place."}
{"text":"Thank you, Brandon, for your hospitable service. However, the triple decker grilled cheese was not enough to absorb all the alcohol you generously provided my stomach with and I spent the next day feeling like death.   Maybe that's where the Devil part comes in?"}
{"text":"I pass this place all the time and the Sun Devil in me thought that the UFC fight would be a great reason to stop in with my bestie in tow. I love the atmosphere..our bartender Cameron was pretty cool and poured us a great drink. We enjoyed our food, great quality and price. If you are looking for a chill place to watch your favorite sport that is comfortable and fun, this is it!"}
{"text":"Drinks are cheap during happy hour! They have specials everyday as well until closing! I ordered the mushroom Swiss burger with sweet potato fries and it was pretty good for $8! Cheap and good! I haven't tried other foods there yet but I can tell you that their portion of the food is great for the price! I would totally go back for food and drinks and hanging out with friends! Great spot!"}
{"text":"Ok. This is your standard sports bar with a fantastic happy hour. Seriously you can not beat it. We came here for the second time in a Saturday and while happy hour wasn't going on, we had a great time. Avery was our waitress and bartender. Apparently a few waitresses called in, but with Avery you wouldn't know it. Happy hour pricing brought us back once. But Avery will bring us back a few times a week. So thank you Avery we will see you next week"}
{"text":"I'm 15 years older than the kids that frequent this place and probably would not hang out here if someone paid me...drunken college kids enjoying cheap drinks (mom and dad pay the tab so the tips suffer hence the service does as well), too loud, shot guzzling, twerking... You get the pic, we've all been there and most of us don't want to go back (unless you're douchey frosted tip, 40yr old azucar papa chasing young tail). However, the food here is awesome!!! And served late .  No they don't have osso bucco, it's bar food, so think fried, saturated fat ladden, almost zero nutritional value food and it is SPECTACULAR!!! No triple fried wings here.  So if you're old like me, go get drunk elsewhere and then on your way home in a drunken stupor, at around 10pm or so, come here to crash the party and load up on grease. Zucchini, wings, chicken tenders, fries dear God, clog my arteries with this deliciousness. Plus watching kids act a fool while waiting is entertaining and makes you feel glad you're settled for boring and more liver friendly lifestyle.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Favorite happy hour 1/2 price drinks and apps. Best taco Tuesday of all time. $1 tasty street tacos that you can't beat anywhere."}
{"text":"I should clarify that when I said there are what seems to be a lot of patrons who are underage, it is not the fault of the bar or their bouncers, at least from what I can tell.  They ID everyone.  I've been ID'd every time I've come here (as have my friends), and I don't look under 21.  I've also stood near the door and seen the bouncers check everyone.  Those who are underage would be getting in with fake IDs.  Just an update to make sure that part of my prior review didn't sound like I was importing fault on to the establishment for that."}
{"text":"Nice.  Clean.  Young atmosphere.  I liked the comfy looking seats around the bar.  Great happy hour prices.  Enjoyed a small order of celery and carrots with hot wing sauce.  Mmmmm..."}
{"text":"The new place looks great and tastes even better! Even though it is bar food, it is excellent bar food! Try the sweet potato fries, their spinach artichoke pizza, or their spicy pineapple wings! Good stuff. The staff is friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Reunited, and it feels so goooooddd! Best deals on booze in Tempe, great atmosphere, love the true Sun Devil feel with all of the posters and the \"library\""}
{"text":"We tried Devil's Advocate recently and weren't  terribly impressed. The service, was poor, and very limited. The servers were much more attentive to certain patrons...We ordered a couple beers and nachos. Nachos are usually a pretty safe thing to order, usually! The cheese was reminiscent of velveeta (if that's your jam, go for it!) Overall very bland and cold.    Most definitely an ASU bar!.."}
{"text":"Very cool and relaxed bar that is a lot of fun. I'm a student and stop in if I'm early to class for lunch and beer or just to do some homework. They have trivia night a couple nights a week I want to try!"}
{"text":"We tried this place for the first time this past weekend while we waited for the comedy show to start across the street at the tempe improv. The food was EXCELLENT!! The prices were also very reasonable & it had a cool English pub feel to the place. I also thought the bathrooms were clean & the service was decent. The beers could've been colder but other than that, I was very pleased. I wish I lived closer so I could go there regularly."}
{"text":"I love Devil's.  Maybe go there twice a week and LOVE Kendrah and Bailey!"}
{"text":"The place was cool. We had the zucchini chips and they were fabulous! Breading was amazing. I ordered the Sante Fe chicken and was very pleased with it. My hunny ordered the street tacos and he loved them. The only fall back was our waitress. Super slow service. When we needed refills we had to go to the bar and get them.. low and behold she's there eating dessert. No problem but she was missing FOREVER! When it came to check out again we couldn't find her. Great food hopefully better service next time we go"}
{"text":"Great happy hour deals, the tacos and rolled tacos for only 4 dollars are delicious. The beer on the happy hour list is half off regular price as well, which makes it pretty cheap."}
{"text":"The staff sucks and they were out of the beer I wanted, and the tequila last time I went. I do live the atmosphere though."}
{"text":"Best daily deals!   Perfect for college students - deals change daily.  Taco Tuesday and Karaoke Wednesday are personally favorites, always a fun and friendly atmosphere - packed on the weekends!"}
{"text":"This place is chill, only been on Thursdays though. Bartenders are efficient and polite. I watched a guy buss his ass all night I eventually asked his name (it was Sam). I've heard their taco Tuesday is good and they have pool tables so that's cool I guess. This place is a good time, but not the like the best time I've ever had. Employees are great though, it really sets a good mood for the night."}
{"text":"The bartender is a complete asshole..  I'm a man of few words. She left the bar 30 min before closing and wouldn't take orders"}
{"text":"It was all right I suppose. Our waitress was kind of... rude. She was just caddy and seemed really annoyed that me and my girl friend were there for lunch.   Despite the silly waitress, we got some giant beers and a few of their mixed drinks. Holy cow were the drinks delicious! That cheered me right up. Except then we realized two tables we were ahead of, got ALL of their food before we even received our appetizer. Might have been because they were all handsome dudes and the waitress seemed more interested in talking to them instead of doing her job.  Our appetizer was actually pretty dang good though seeing as it was just queso and salsa with chips, and we got some burgers. The burger was great. It was one of the biggest I've seen for sure. Haha.   I would probably go again if I was in the area and needed a drink really quick, but I won't be planning a night out there ever again."}
{"text":"If i remembered correctly... Thursday nights they have BOGO(buy one get one) drinks. We had some adios and long islands all around, boy was it awesome. Pretty packed here. Filled with lots college kids and some older adults in certain areas. There are TVs and funny signs around this place. Must read them, pretty funny. :) Will definitely come here again when I visit.  great place to be with a group of friends."}
{"text":"Came here for taco Tuesday! Got a bean taco and the Mac n cheese one. Both were good not great. Wish they had more options. Feel like you can only take a few bites of the Mac and cheese one before you are just over it. Also, service wasn't great at all."}
{"text":"I went to devil's with the intention of having a few drinks and heading to another bar, but the band playing on the patio (ska /rap/rock/awesome ) and overall fun atmosphere of the place kept my there 'til last call."}
{"text":"Meh. There are so many other better bars in Tempe so I am not sure I would be back.  Went for a Wednesday night happy hour for cheap drinks and food.  Had 2 Devilritas, pretty tasty for $3 each. Husband had 2 beers at a good price.  The environment was nice and waitress friendly & attentive, but the food was not that great. Ordered the $6 buffalo pizza. Sauce was way to peppery and hot for my liking. Chicken rolls ok, but really heavy. Chips and dip trio also just ok.  I'm glad we only spent $31 for all of that food. Maybe the food reviews on here are good because everything tastes better when you are intoxicated."}
{"text":"For a bar that I haven't been to in literally 24 years (back when it was Maloney's), it was nice to check this place out. The service was slow and it wasn't very busy. We had a few drinks. A lot has changed in the near two and a half decades."}
{"text":"I love Devil's Advocate, and I will ALWAYS go there on Thursdays, but tonight was just ridiculous. I love the 2for1 drinks and usually the music is great, but tonight the DJ was absolutely ridiculous. I go to Devils Advocate to listen to my favorite songs, but tonight it was just so much EDM with a few songs in between. I dont know who the new DJ is, but he definitely isn't a favorite and I heard plenty of complaints all night. We ended up leaving before 12:30 am!   Again, I love Devil's Advocate! One of my favorite bars! The bartenders and security guards are absolutely phenomenal and I get nothing but great service there whenever I go! But the music is absolutely what makes the mood, and tonight, the mood was pretty dead. I'm sure the only reason people actually stayed was to take advantage of the 2 for 1 drinks."}
{"text":"Great service, Lauren and the rest of the staff were awesome. The spinach salad with chicken is better than anything coming out of any fox concept restaurant. Great atmosphere for an ASU game. Go Devils."}
{"text":"Happy hour is off the charts. The prices are typically half off for appetizers, beers, and cocktails. SO GREAT.   I had the tacos which were so insanely good, the chicken rolls, mozzarella sticks, and the \"con queso\". Of course this was all shared but being able to taste them all, I thought that they were all awesome, especially at half off. Not that long before my last visit, I had the spinach salad with chicken. YOU WILL BE IMPRESSED. I was.  I can't tell you how many Thursdays in college I spent at Devil's as well. They have 2 for 1 drinks and that is a recipe for a stellar night. You may not remember it, but I assure you it was stellar.  Take the chance and try out Devil's Advocate regardless of the rating. I don't know where the negatives are coming from but I think for the price, it is grand."}
{"text":"You know, it's not just about the food and the drinks sometimes.  It's the service that can bring you back or not.  With that being said...what service!?  Gosh, maybe my Engrish not goo and you didn't hear me co-wreck-lee, but when I request for my check maybe someone should attend to me to get it rolling!  Didn't think trying to pay was such a huge ordeal!  We even had someone go and chase down our \"waitress\" to ask for some help, but the Devil had other plans and she played a disappearing act.  However, before the Devil gets to me --- drinks at this place wasn't too bad - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This isn't the worst place I've been to, but was a long way from being a 5 star. The plus side was the cost of food and drinks. The drinks weren't bad. The food could use a little improvement but still was decent.  This was my first time to DA and I can truly say I will never return. The staff seemed to lack communication and training. 1) We had a party and an area was \"supposed\" to be reserved for the group. Waiters sat people in our area. 2) We waited thirty minutes for our drinks. I waited another twenty minutes for another drink which I was informed was taken to the wrong table. The replacement was brought out in two minutes. 3) Food that was brought out by a helping waitress had no clue who or what table to take it to.  If this place would work on its training I might consider coming back."}
{"text":"I think this is my place of choice for specials. There are specials (food and drink) every day of the week. Usually, the long island ice tea is my choice because it's only $4 on certain days. Also, $5 wings and $6 whole pizzas on other days. $5 giant mugs of beer too for the specials.   A lot of times, I only go on days with the long island special. The food is not bad for a sports bar and grill. I had the steak nachos, pizza and wings before and they were good. Depending on the days, service could be slow especially if there is a college game day or just a lot of people there.  What you should do is go on their website, see what they have on that day, and decide if you want to go. That's the best way to do it. Because some specials don't apply on college game days.  And plan out your trip with the light rail if you don't want to drive. It's a 5 minute walking distance from the University and Rural station. Then go drink and take the rail back home. Or take the rail Mill Ave for more drinks.  Like I said, check their website for the happy hour menu and the daily specials. Then decide if you want to go. There's also a sushi restaurant across the street, and a shwarma, Indian, Thai and pizza place next door too. If you don't want food at DA's, grab cheap drinks and go eat elsewhere.  Or grab some drinks and go to Fedex Kinkos next door to hang out. I'm sure the employees will love that. ;)"}
{"text":"Thursday two for one drink specials! You can't beat that. But of course that comes with a grain a salt... it is packed with undergrads and the parking can fill up leaving you to park across the street at del taco. Fortunately the place is a good size and there are entertaining music videos that accompanies the super loud music."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Waiting over 20 minutes for someone to even come get our drink order. Service is always bad here and it's not even busy tonight."}
{"text":"This place is GREAT! $1 beer/$3 Smirnoff specials every day - killer food specials ($1 tacos, 2f1 pizza, 2f1 burgers, etc.) as well! Bailey is one of the best servers (and all around best person) ever ... what more do you want?!"}
{"text":"Dear Riley,   (Or at least I think that's your name, since it was listed as server on the receipt.)   I did not appreciate how you spent the whole time my two friends and I were on the patio at Devil's Advocate, going out of your way to make us feel unwelcome. I did not like that you rushed our drink order, even before you dropped off the drink menu, and after we had to flag you down for service. I did not appreciate the attitude we got from you after we finished our 2nd round of drinks and wanted to hold off on the next. We had half a basket of food, some of which were on their way to our mouths, so no, we do not want our check just yet. It was unnecessary to take my napkins as I was still eating. Were they in your way?  You know, being unused and all? And it was ridiculously rude to clear our drinks, as we're sitting there,  still talking, after we just paid.  Maybe I didn't notice the non-existent line of people waiting for our table.  That's my bad. And if you felt I was rude for commenting that I wasnt done with my water just yet, as you're trying to shoo us out the door, I'm sorry.  Your insincere apology was duly noted.  I guess I didn't know that you guys ran a restaurant/bar where people left more annoyed than when they came in.  It's def one way to run a business. I'm sure many other places can take a note or two on how to make a patron feel unwelcome from you guys! Hope that strategy works for you in the long run! The only thing I do regret though, is tipping you more than 15%. If I weren't in the industry myself, you would have gotten nothing.   I honestly hope you were just having a bad day.  And that the ill treatment resulted from nothing more than that. If this is the norm though,  I'm surprised you guys have any customers at all.    Thanks, though! Tonight was memorable.  But I wouldn't do it again."}
{"text":"Went to Devils Advocate for a big sports event tonight. I have never had greater service in my life.  Big BIG (yes all caps) ups to manager Andy and the angel behind the bar, Lauren. If you want your drink poured with the utmost professionalism plus a wink, Lauren is your gal. Me and my wife have never had more fun. Top notch bartending and top notch service.  We're Christian. So NOT big fans of the devil, but we ARE big fans of Devils Advocate. Go there if you want a good time!"}
{"text":"I strongly dislike the food here, and there have been a number of occurrences where bartender basically screwed my boyfriend over and what not.  If i had it my way i would not come back to this establishment for the life of me. I am not a horny college kid that is here to stare at girls in shorts and their boobs all night.  They have a decent Thursday night special on drinks but i am over that stage in my life where i want to go out and get wasted and drink til i cannot remember type B.S. I would rather go somewhere get a good deal on better beer and wine and have maybe one or two drinks tops with DELICIOUS food. Not crummy food. How can you have a special going on and have nasty food? I think the reason people give such high scores is for 1. The Girls 2. Their drink specials 3. they are drunk and love the food. Yeah its like all the drunken idiots that love Denny's. Seriously? Denny's? Get out of here with that! \"Nobody goes to Denny's, People end up at Denny's\"  If it were me drinking like these college kids and looking to go out i would rather drink at home to pre game and save money then  go to the bars. That is just me I am thinking logically at the moment!    As i am looking at the reviews on the right hand side majority of my top 3 ideas as to why people are giving such high ratings and i can bet you one other thing is because they are single and have all the time in the world to come here for that special that isn't as great as it used to be. Anytime my boyfriend brings up the name i cringe and want to stay home."}
{"text":"Come here on a Thursday and the bar will be packed for buy one get ones. Definitely the best deal near campus for thirsty Thursday.   The weekend is definitely a more chill vibe with 10-15 people there on a Friday but with the live music it's pretty fun for a laid back night.   Overall the staff is very attentive and it's worth checking out on Thursday."}
{"text":"This is my works favorite go to place to grab a drink after a long shift, they have good specials and a very unique interior. Go check it, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"As SunDevils, my fiancé and I thought we should check this place out before a ASU football game last semester (so three months ago). I remember Devil House, and I expected this place to be similar. However, it wasn't similar at all, leaving me disappointed. Devils Advocate had hardly any college aged individuals. Honestly, it seemed to be filled with mostly old single men customers who were harassing the waitresses and the promoter girls. Plus, we just weren't impressed with the beer list or the food. The only plus was that they double booked two different promoters so we got two free shots."}
{"text":"Food is real good & they have a descent variety of beers.  Waitress was real nice; I have no complaints.    I only gave it four stars, instead of five because of my own preferences; which has nothing to do with their service or quality of food, just preference.  If you like fun & local college type bars, you will love this place!"}
{"text":"Can't even write a full review because we sat for 10 minutes while 4 SERVERS sat talking by the bar. Made eye contact with two of them multiple times, but still no one came to our table. We left after 10 minutes, one saw us walking out and said nothing about it. They had maybe 4 other tables at the time. Worst service I've had in a long time, and absolutely will not be going back"}
{"text":"I came here to watch the football games and let me tell you that this place is so awesome!! They have so may tabs and the staff seem decently friendly.   It was super slow and I was told about the Bloody Mary bar, so of course I said YES!! I wasn't aware, which was partially my fault for not asking, that every time I went to get a \"refill\" I had to pay $8 I figured (this being a blonde moment) that I was going to pay a certain amount and it was good for the afternoon - that's how it is at several places I have been to. That's not the reason for my not so good review. I actually had to get up every time to get my drink replaced - what happened to my cocktail waitress?? The waitress I had wasn't super friendly but she did take my food order and nothing was wrong with it and I did enjoy my BBQ pork sliders.   My only recommendation is that if it's busy you may want to go elsewhere if you expect to have good service (service with a smile) or service at all. I was rarely checked on and that to me speaks mounds."}
{"text":"Fine bar food for a great deal if you go during happy hour. Our waitress was very attentive and always grabbed what we needed before we knew we needed it. Went to watch the ASU game and had a great experience until the sundevils lost. R.I.P."}
{"text":"another college bar, just away from Mill but still the same old. Cheap drinks on Thursday. Music is ok, the parking lot is fantastic and if you want to avoid running into your students, better check somewhere else."}
{"text":"The bartenders are hasty in their work. Won't give pay attention to what you say. The beer is full of foam/froth on the top! The management should probably work on them a bit more."}
{"text":"Devils advocate is a great college bar. It can also be a welcome break from Mill Ave.  the staff is friendly and easy in the eyes.  They have good drink and food specials almost every night of the week.  Some highlights include BOGO burgers on Monday, dollar tacos on Tuesday, and 241 drinks on Thursday.  Check it out and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. From the outside, it seemed cool. It isn't. The food, atmosphere, and service were well below average. Left disappointed and wishing I ate elsewhere."}
{"text":"We had been there all night on the devil on university and requested our tab 6 times and Phil the bartender said they didn't have it and after being rude the 7th time we asked for it finally found it. I'm a server myself and I know this isn't equivalent to what service should be like. They yelled at us saying we lost our own debit card three times and kicking us out until they finally found it! Bad customer service"}
{"text":"After long drive to Phoenix from CA wanting to watch the Packer Game decided to stop at Devil's as we would not make it home in time for 10am kickoff asked for lunch menu was told not til 1pm. Passed on breakfast menu. Placed drink order. Waitress told us they may start lunch early as they received  requests for lunch.  All of a  sudden we  look around and their bringing out lunch food for tables around ours. Waitress never came back to tell us they were serving lunch. So we asked for lunch menu and placed an order of chicken tenders at start of 4th quarter. Last 3 minutes to end of game still no food. Waitress said be food will be up shortly. Waitress brings food we asked for plates and are told had no clean dishes. Waitress got us 3 lined food baskets. We ate and left.  Chicken tenders were good..  We''ve been to this establishment for happy hour. Always good food and service. Not today!!!! Won't go back for a game!"}
{"text":"Well its a sports bar with AWESOMENESS!!!  Great specials during the week and a staff that helps to maintain the fun levels without overplaying the \"keep it down fellas.\"  Adam has been my drink faciliator many a times and he's been great with service and explaining some the new beers that come onto tap.  Taco Tuesday is the place to be and with the amount of tv's, pool table, shoot'em up type games and great staff this is the place to go with a group of friends looking to reunite and remember all the blurry and forgotten nights again!  Being close to ASU helps to keep the crowds up if your looking for energy and during the week it cools down just enough to hold a few laughs and good convo.  I'm committed to this place for the food as well.  It's pub grub but its good pub grub damnit!!!"}
{"text":"Nice place good food I would recommend anyone wanting to watch the game a lot of T.V's lot's off Specials"}
{"text":"Used to love going on Thursday nights,but unfortunately there service has become so overly rude! They have no manners last time I went to devils  One of the \"security\", shoved me right out of the way & of course I was annoyed & asked if he could say \"excuse me \" well instead he decided to light his flashlight at me & said \"Move!\" Ohh & They also have 2 for 1 drinks but what's the point if they only pour it on one of the drinks? I actually saw this happen last time I was in there & the bartender glanced at me & said \"it's because I put more than enough on this one\"..like uhm what? We're paying for 2 not 1.... Horrible service!"}
{"text":"This is the best bar and grill in Tempe. All of the food is tasty and there is big list of drafts. The rotating specials are great especially Taco Tuesday, Thursday night 2-for1, and their $1 Coors Light drafts during lunch hour. Devil's has so many TVs around the bar, you'll never have a problem watching a game. The servers are always quick and work hard. They also handle large groups well.  The huge parking lot is a plus since you'll never spend time searching for a spot like on Mill. Huge convenience factor."}
{"text":"Devil's is a great place to come with friends and hang out and catch any sports game. Their happy hour is the best in town. A nice place to come to and cheer on the sundevils."}
{"text":"This place is the most poorly run spot ever. They don't have a host, and just tell you to sit wherever is open. Well it was the day of the college football final, and there were at least 3 tables that could seat 4, with 1 person at them each. If you actually wanted to make money, ask those alone to sit at a 2 top, or the bar. These 4 customers decided to go spend our money somewhere else."}
{"text":"Went there for Taco Tuesday last night and talk about a great deal! They have $1 taco, chicken, steak and carnitas. Wow they are good. You do have to have a beverage purchase, but they also have $2 Mexican drafts, so it's a great deal all around!  There was also a live band playing as well. Bartenders are always very friendly and outgoing."}
{"text":"Met up with some friends for his birthday. We had a blast the bartender was nice and friendly offered different types of beer I have never had before. Defiantly one of my new favorite bars."}
{"text":"My favoite sports bar by far. I can't think of one thing I don't like. The foods awesome, the drinks are innexpensive, they've got deals every day, and the waitresses are extremely friendly.  If you're looking for a place to hang out, watch the game, or have a great night, I'd definitely say go here. Every time."}
{"text":"Devil's Advocate has absolutely, positively the BEST sandwich in town in the 'Sun Devil Club.' Mixes the best attributes and ingredients of your favorite bar sandwich and country club snack. Pair that sandwich with a basket of french fries and one of their various ice cold beers on tap and it's an unbeatable lunchtime meal. Dinner's just as great, especially on Tuesday!! $1 tacos and $2 Dos Equis is the best deal in Tempe and the deal is good because the food is GREAT. Most importantly, this is the best spot in town to watch ASU football games in the fall and winter. A total Sun Devil bar!!"}
{"text":"This place is alright. Nothing special about the atmosphere but good food and the usual slew of drinks. Taco Tuesdays is a great deal--$2/taco. And I think I went on a Thursday night one time and it was two for one drinks which is crazy good. I typically like places with a little more personality but this is a decent deal/scene."}
{"text":"We live in the way Northwest Valley and don't go to Tempe often but we were at Tempe Town Lake for the JDRF walk and they handed out coupons and 25% of the proceeds were being donated, so we decided to try this place.  I can see how happy hour would be fun for college students.  The service and food weren't that great.  Considering we were the only people in there at 1045am, I thought they would be more attentive.  I had the Frisco burger which was way over cooked and dry.  I was surprised they didn't have a plain burger or even ask how I wanted mine cooked.  My husband had the chicken fingers which were amazing.  I ended up eating one of those because they were absolutely huge!  I would recommend those to anyone.  Our friend had the burger with the egg and onion rings and he said it was fantastic.  They do have a large selection of beer on tap and serve Coke products.  I don't think we would go back to eat, but maybe for happy hour drinks."}
{"text":"This is a great bar near ASU.  It's got a good feel inside and though it can get crowded it never feels packed inside.  It attracts students, but isn't grimey and dirty like some bars near college towns can be.  The service is always good and the food is decent for a bar.  This is a great place to meet friends and have a few drinks on the weekend or to catch the game.  I would give this place 5 stars but I went once on a Friday night and they were OUT of Bud Light.  Unacceptable."}
{"text":"Great food, great price, and super personal service! If I lived closer it would be my hang out place!!"}
{"text":"Great wings at a great price! they have daily specials that are awesome for food and drinks! I had the mango habenero flavor. Great choice they were the bomb, cooked perfect and came with fries and carrots and celery. The service was friendly and felt comfortable by myself. The music playing was fierce. Will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"Good happy hour specials. The cheese dip is AWESOME. Period. The rest of it is standard bar food. Staff is pretty good and will change games on tv upon request."}
{"text":"Skyler is the reason you just lost a loyal Tuesday customer. Had a friend in town and took him out for some good food and had the worst service of my life. Typically a great place for my taco Tuesday. Everyone at my table had their food gone before mine ever came and that was after we had to tell the waitress. She never apologized or asked if she could do something to make it better. Then she avoided our table failing to bring us any checks. To top it off she didn't bring back my full change assuming I would leave a tip!"}
{"text":"Great place. Andy is a must see here. Hes runs the place amazingly! Games are fun and food was awesome. Waitress and cook doused my wings in buffalo sauce which was awesome. I always ask everywhere else and nobody ever puts strong amount of wing sauce on the wings. Much appreciated!!!  Great football atmosphere. TVs everywhere!"}
{"text":"Checked out this joint on my quest to find best bar around. It's not bad at all actually ... the other reviews about \"go for Taco Tuesday\" is spot on. I had two tacos and a Dos Equis - $5.95 ... you cannot beat that price.  The tacos were actually above decent, so much so that I ordered another one after finishing the first round. It is a college bar, but there was a fantastic mix of people - students, locals, bikers, professionals.  The service was good (I sat at the bar) - it was busy by there were lots of follow ups and refills by the bar staff."}
{"text":"Originally introduced to this bar via the Tempe Beerathon and most recently Road Runner Sports Third Thursday run, I have also stopped here a few times for a drink. This is becoming a favorite place of mine to hang out after work when I am looking for a quiet happy hour. If I am not going with a group of people and just want to hang alone or with another person, this spot is an excellent sports bar, has great happy hour prices, and good food.   I have had the street tacos before - one night of the week they are $1. Small, but tasty. During happy hour 4-7 drinks are half price as is the food. I had the wings and while the hot had an underlying spicy flavor, they also seemed to be somewhat sweet. Either way they were good. I have also had chips and salsa before  - the chips are fresh and immediately out of the cooker and the salsa is spicy. They do have $1 pints, but I am confused when that happens. I thought it was 4-7, but it might have been until 4. When I received my bill my first 2 were $1, then others were $2. Still a good price.  Oh, and I have to say - the staff at the Devil's Advocate is the hottest in town."}
{"text":"We went during happy hour when the drafts and appetizers are half off. We tried the vegetarian tacos, nachos, and fried zucchini. I had the pear cider and my boyfriend got the gingerbread ale.    I would've given it all two stars if everything wasn't super cheap.  My biggest pet peeve with nachos is when the toppings/cheese only covers half the nachos. These nachos were the epitome of that. The flavor was nice, but I had a nice pile of topping-less chips at the end. :(   The fried zucchini wasn't completely fried so the inside was still doughy. The vegetarian tacos have minimal flavor. Cue all three hot sauces they have available.   My pear cider was pretty decent, but my boyfriend said the gingerbread beer was less than average.   The waitress was super friendly and it has a nice atmosphere. We went for the BCS Championship game and there are ample televisions for viewing. I'd definitely go back for another game, but definitely not solely for food."}
{"text":"What can I say? Devil's Advocate is a solid establishment! It's a go-to place for a few drinks after work. I usually end up getting the quesadilla with steak. It's so good and greasy! The vibe here is great too. Pretty chill and not obnoxiously loud. Plenty of TVs to catch a game on. The servers and wait staff are all very nice people too.   Well done, Devil's!!!"}
{"text":"Listen here,   Taco Tuesday in Tempe you're hungry and work/school was rough. You want the best tacos in town for the best price, because let's face it we'll all are ballin on a budget. I have never in my life had a better shrimp taco. The owner is a great guy who is always watching over his staff, he's here all the time taking care of business. The staff are extremely personable and welcoming. You will always have a good laugh, and leave here nice and full feeling good. The environment is relaxed and definitely a place to come watch \"the game,\" doesn't matter what sport they always have it. If tacos aren't you're thing maybe try their buy one get one drink specials on Thursday nights. Cheap date and she doesn't even have to know! All joking aside for being a sports bar and grill with food until 2am it's a pretty awesome place. I've only lived in Tempe for about three weeks now and definitely come here every chance I get. It's a great place where you can just bring your group of friends and everyone hang out, it might get pretty busy at times but the servers do what they can to attend everyone so if you're not the patient type of person this is not the place to come when it's busy. They are only human after-all, just like you and I.  All in all I love this bar, the family, friends and memories made here so far are irreplaceable. Come in sometime and give it a shot, spark up a conversation with a stranger or your server/bartender. I assure you, you won't be disappointed. Who knows you might run into me!"}
{"text":"This is a sports bar & a great place to watch a game. Perfect for a bucket of beer, some wings & lots of noise. It's not a great place to order anything other than beer & wings. Unfortunately, we stopped in here for a quick lunch on our way to an ASU hockey game. We had 45 minutes & it wasn't enough time.  The service started fine. We had sodas pretty quickly. But then it was another 10 to order, and another 30 to get our food. The food was terrible. We ordered the cheese sticks which were cold, and not melted at all on the inside. They were served on a gross piece of lettuce that was still wet. My BLT also had the wet nasty lettuce, and bacon crumbles... not even a strip of bacon. Hubby's sammy was also gross. However my son liked his wings. All in all - don't bother with this place unless you want wings & beer."}
{"text":"I've driven past this place a trillion times, and when my boyfriend suggested we watch one of the bowl games the other night, this place popped into my head. We were there on a Monday night and it wasn't very packed, just a few parties here and there. The place is very well kept and looks really nice. I described it to my friend as a \"classy sports bar\".   Anyways, me and the boy grabbed a table and since I hadn't had dinner yet, I ordered the chicken rolls and some fries and he just had the pretzels. It was happy hour which was a plus, but the prices weren't outrageous to begin with. The description for the chicken rolls on the menu sounds far better than what they currently are (the server pointed out the change before I ordered them). They weren't terrible or anything, just pretty \"meh\" I guess. The fries were good though and they came in a huge tin. And my bf seemed to enjoy his pretzels. We had a few drinks while we were there, and there were plenty of tvs with various games on.   I can imagine when school in session how crazy busy this place is, but the business is well deserved."}
{"text":"Just 3 VERY small TVs behind the bar. Really not close to the bar seating either. Needs a TV remodel BIG TIME!  Good happy hour food specials. Onion rings are great and only $2. Lagunitas IPA and other premium beers are $3.75 a pint on HH.  They do have bar poker on Monday nights."}
{"text":"I had lunch at the Devil's Advocate today with a few friends. It wasn't terrible, but not great -- mainly because of the food.  The waitress was friendly and took our drink orders quickly, but then disappeared for a long time when we were ready to order food. I think she may have been the only waitress on duty, since she was helping people on the far side of the restaurant area. It was pretty slow, but that's stretching it a little thin.  I ordered a BLT and sweet potato fries. Both sounded good, but didn't look so great when they arrived. The bread was grilled rather than toasted, so it was a little greasy and otherwise limp. I was happy that they served the mayo on the side, though a little cup of mayo is kind of unappealing to see. The lettuce and tomato were fresh, but the bacon was really odd. It was very similar to the kind of bacon you'd get in England, which is to say that it's sort of like Canadian bacon for pizza. Not crisp, greasy, stringy. Yuck. The sweet potato fries were pretty unappealing too. They were hot but limp and not particularly flavorful.  The ambiance and decor was good, so if you're wanting a drink, it probably wouldn't be an issue. I liked the comfy chairs around the bar, and there were TVs everywhere so it'd be a great place for watching sports. (They had a World Cup game on but the broadcast was in Arabic, which makes zero sense to me.)"}
{"text":"Great place to go for beer and a burger. Cool vibe with good service and seating areas. Huge bar, outdoor seating and lot's of TV's.   Good music and everyone talking and having a good time, good place to hang out."}
{"text":"Ok so I love this bar on Thursdays typically because it's 2 for 1 drinks and it's usually beautiful.  Well last night was one of the worst experiences ever. The girl I ordered drinks from was so mean, didn't smile didn't say thank you or even look like she gave any cares about anything. And then I went to the restroom and it ran out of toilet paper so I kindly asked the security guard who was in front of the male restroom if he could get us some or ask another associate to get some for the ladies.  His response was I don't care about y'all I'm guarding the men's room and I'm not leaving and I don't care so no I'm not. I again said well we are woman we literally NEED toilet paper if you can please ask someone else to get us some that'd be great. Again he said \"girl I'm busy I don't have time to get y'all drunk asses toilet paper stop asking leave me alone\" I then went to one of the og bartenders who I know has been bartending there for a while and asked to speak to a manager about the situation and found out the very rude bartender who was serving me before was supposedly the manager. I understand this is a \"college\" bar but service is everything especially for me who has been in the industry for years and this was just SAD. I definitely will not be back any time soon, I'll just wait out the cycle of associates."}
{"text":"Just went here to watch the Steeler game.  This place has a good atmosphere for watching sports.  Plenty of tv screens, with multiple games going on at the same time.  You can pick your seat next which game you want to watch.  I ate the BLTA sandwich.  Plenty of bacon, nice and crispy the way I like it.  Toast just a bit too crunchy.  Onion rings on the side were delicious.  Also, tried the sweet potato fries which were very good as well.  Waitress was attentive, refilling drinks and checking in on our table.  I would go back to this bar.  Bill for four people was 36 bucks.  That was for 2 meals, a side of wings, 3 beers and several soft drinks."}
{"text":"Great bar, the cheese sticks are awesome. Great Sunday specials and wonderful service. The bar is very clean and we loved our visit."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a great place, great food, great drinks, and fun atmosphere this is the place to be. Whether you want to party hard or relax with friends this place offers it all! It is by far the best \"bar food\" you will find anywhere and always with deals and cheap prices! The draft selection is huge and always served ice cold!! I would suggest my favorites the taco Tuesday $1 taco and $2 Mexican beer deal and also the very popular 2-4-1 Thursday's!! This is the best bar in Arizona and I'm sure many other states so trust me done waste your money or time and go there! Also, try the sweet potato frys!!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Devil's! I swear I go every Tuesday for taco Tuesday because their tacos are the BEST! Basically all of them are a dollar except their shrimp tacos. The shrimp tacos are so worth it though! The service is usually pretty good, but it could be improved on. The girls always try to remember my order and most of the time it ends up being wrong because of that, but the food is so good that it makes up for it."}
{"text":"After 3 years at ASU, I finally went to devil's for the first time. I'm currently kicking myself because I'm upset that I've been missing out on cheap drinks and food!  We came on a Friday night and there was reverse happy hour starting at 10. Before 10, they were still having normal Friday drink specials! $5 vodka and $5 jack and coke!  We were meeting up with some family and had a group of 7 people so we definitely took advantage of the specials.   I also ordered the buffalo fries and they were so good. I subbed the blue cheese for ranch no problem and everyone at the table couldn't keep their hands to themselves so we ended up having to order a 2nd batch! Yum. :)   Skylar did an awesome job serving us and being an awesome sport. My uncle and cousins were definitely having a really good time joking with her and embarrassing me, but she was such an awesome server and had a great attitude. :)"}
{"text":"A college type bar without the college kids roaming around.  So take that in as your baseline. Food is good for late night eats, I wouldn't recommend this for dinner or a formal date. But what is great about this place is the ambiance and they have a decent beer selection.  They are very accommodating when it comes to big groups, but I consistently have seen slow service, and it is hard to get a hold of the waitresses. We have had to literally flag then down every single time."}
{"text":"A solid \"college bar\".  Good specials, and lots of fun stuff to occupy your time while you drink (such as shuffle board.)  Nice patio with TVs and a good number of seats. The bar is not a very efficient shape, but a small negative among many positives."}
{"text":"Devil's... the place my younger ASU grad friends have raves about as \"the\" ASU bar! Conveniently located walkable-close to my neighborhood. I set up a nice Friday evening happy hour with a large group of friends with management's help. I asked for a few tables to reserve and they gave us the entire left side of the bar/restaurant area! Our servers were great, from the mass arrival of most of my friends, all the way til our group had been whittled down a few hours labor to just one table. There was a creeper around our group (oh happy day, before their PM security arrived) and the staff made sure to keep an eye on him until he left and drove away. Not much of a damper on our time.  Although they don't outwardly announce Friday happy hour prices, they have them 3p-7p. Your typical (carbolicious) bar food fare, mix of local and national beers, and well drinks. After a few rounds and some food, I spent roughly $30 on myself. Looks like they broadcast a variety of local and national sports too but especially heavy on the Sun Devils!"}
{"text":"Good food. Relaxing atmosphere. Fun place to come for a few drinks. Some of there servers are not very attentive though.  If you asked one of the girls for another drink there response is important not your server. The guy bar tender with the beard is awsome though. Always friendly and is very attentive. That's why I'm giving four stars."}
{"text":"This place wasn't bad, but I was a little irritated by something. I called ahead, because I live in Glendale and this is a bit of a drive for me. I wanted to ask if I could not only watch the Diamondbacks game, but also hear the sound. I can go to any sports bar and watch the game without sound, but when I called they told us we WOULD be able to watch the game with sound.  However, once we got there we were told that we weren't able to watch the game with sound because the NHL playoffs and the NBA playoffs were on. I really don't have an issue with that, but I did have an issue with them telling us on the phone that they would do that for us.  As for the rest, the service really wasn't bad, the Caesar salad is a HUGE portion for only $6.50. We apparently got there during happy hour, so our first two drinks were 4 dollars, but they didn't give us any notification of happy hour until we got our checks.  During our time here we also ordered 2 additional drinks that were 8 dollars a piece. Again, not really a big deal but we had no idea what time happy hour was or when it ended. Most restaurants  tell us it's happy hour when we sit down.  Honestly, i'd probably go back to this place when the playoffs aren't on. They really weren't a bad place overall, but the communication leaves a lot to be desired. They did tell me if the playoffs weren't on, they would have been happy to turn the sound on for me. So, for now i'm just gonna leave it at 3 stars until I get another opportunity to try them out."}
{"text":"We come often tonight the service was poor. we ordered ranch with our meal she brought it out after we finished the meal and still charged us. the worst part is when she picked up my credit card and shoved it in her bra till she got to the register to run it. I have never had a server put my CC down thier bra so disgusting."}
{"text":"Awesome bar. Plus Kendra gave me free food aand I got to watch Boston kill Vancouver for the Stanley Cup finals. Yay!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour deals. $4.50 for a giant, nearly pitcher sized beer, solid appetizers, and good food. Lots of TV's, and a pool table or two. The only issue we had was the lack of table seating. For such a large building it seemed like there weren't that many tables. The bar takes up half of the floor space."}
{"text":"I had lunch at this restaurant.   The atmosphere was great with music and a bunch of tvs. The staff was friendly and their menu had a lot of choices at a reasonable price.   I had the Cobb salad. It was great!  I will definitely come again!!!"}
{"text":"cool setup inside... get here early if you plan on coming to watch a game and want somewhere to sit. it gets very busy...and you will be shit outta luck when it comes to finding somewhere to plop your ass... other than that cool little spot!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's the closest bar within walking distance to me and I take advantage of that! They have good deals on Thursday nights and it gets packed on the patio. I usually see people I know from school or around town from time to time here. The staff is pretty good. I usually have good service. I like the Aloha Chicken sandwich or the Hawaiian pizza with a tall Blue Moon. They also have big flat screen tv's for football games!"}
{"text":"Extremely bland food. If you want to be disappointed, come here. Made both my cousin and I sick after eating. Asked for medium rare burger, they gave me rare. The service was extremely mediocre. She never came to ask us how we were doing, and overall very displease. Never going again."}
{"text":"I am really hard to please and I was very impressed. The remodel is great. There are lots of different areas inside and outside where you can enjoy all the TVs and music. I love the food, the service was outstanding and I really liked the books all over the place. I can see myself hanging here a lot."}
{"text":"**Edited to reply to the Manager** *After receiving a response to my comment on Yelp, I took the time to reply to the manager through email on March 26th. My email detailed exactly why I'd written my review in the way I had and gave a further description of the waitress who'd taken our money. To clarify: I am not blaming this restaurant for the difficulty their patrons have with turning out of the bar, I am simply warning people who may come here to cautious when leaving the premises. My rating was based solely on what occurred within Devil's Advocate.   As of today, April 6th, I have no received a response from the Manager.*    There's something sketchy going on with the staff.   The best thing about this place is price and the worst is their service. Parking isn't awful, but turning west out of the parking lot is a nightmare. I only come here when we're looking for the diviest place in town, and this place always delivers.   Service: THIS was the problem. We had a middle-aged blonde serving us on a Friday night. Service was slow, and our waitress unfriendly. The worst part by far however, was her change giving ability. We had two bills at our table, and she managed to not only round down the change, but had shorted each of us a dollar. I ended up with $7 change after giving a $20 for a $11.39 bill.   I was not drunk enough to miss this. I didn't bring it up because it wasn't a big enough issue that night. Let's be clear: I would've given the waitress that dollar, and more, as a tip. It was nevertheless, a little presumptive of her to just take it.   Food: their bar food is alright. It's nothing to right home about, but they will guarantee you as much grease and carbs as your wallet and stomach can afford. The sweet potato fries are a favorite, as are their wings. Beer prices are cheap.   Moral of this story: don't expect a lot, and pay with a credit card. You won't get your change."}
{"text":"well the owner contacted me, apologized, and offered for me to come in and give it another try on him.....I declined because I knew it wouldn't be a real second chance for his staff to treat me as a valued customer, they would know to expect me. I may return some time again, will report back then."}
{"text":"Cheap drinks for HH!  Cheap food for HH as well, but I'm not really too excited about the food.  I had a chicken tacos, a beef taco, and nachos.  None were very good... the tortillas tasted kind of like I imagine plastic tastes... and they were way too greasy (as were each of the tacos).  The nachos... hmmm, what can I say that is good about the nachos... nothing.  In fact, they were probably the worst nachos that I have ever had.  I really hate to knock a family-owned restaurant, but... perhaps the southwestern style cuisine on the menu should just be taken off and replaced by something else like burgers.    With that said, overall my bill only came out to $17 with two margaritas and three tacos on it!  When I'm in the mood to get out for without busting my budget, then I will be back... even though I probably will refrain from eating any of the food."}
{"text":"At least one tv visible from every seat, wait staff that is friendly and smiling, bar food to meet any requirements, and a large selection of beers on draft. Portobello wrap rocked."}
{"text":"Good burgers and apps.  the service is pretty good and the place has a special all the time.  I think everything is 1/2 price until 7!  Even when that ends they have something special.  Between the billion TV's and cheap booze I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Gooooo Devils!!!!!!! =)  I came here for the first time with a friend for happy hour. He said they have pretty good specials and everything was half off. I got the happy hour menu and ordered the Devils Island. Beware when drinking this! It's like a long island but better and extremely strong!   I also ordered the nachos which were pretty good. I really liked the melted cheese that they used. It was quite yummy.   I'm giving this place a 3 star because the happy menu is quite confusing. It gives you a list of items of food happy hour items, then on the back is the drink menu. However, those drinks were NOT on happy hour. So apparently mine was not. My friend ordered a regular long island and the waitress didn't even know if it was on happy hour or not. Seems like she wasn't very knowledgeable of the happy hour menu. If you go to their website they have an entirely different happy hour menu. It's quite confusing.   I think it's a really good place to hang out with friends for a drink or watch the game. I really liked my drink and nachos. I'd come back, but I definitely think they need to create a better happy hour menu for their customers and their staff needs to be more knowledgeable with it.."}
{"text":"Devil's Advocate has decent bar food at decent prices.  Good specials, good prices on alcohol, and very good service! So, why not 4 stars?  I'm not sure.  It's super comfortable, and a nice place to go for Happy Hour, or Taco Tuesday, but for some reason, I just never go. Probably only because I've decreased my drinking and am attempting to go vegetarian.  Or it could be that since I work in Tempe, I'm usually eager to get OUT of Tempe...  It should maybe be 4 stars?"}
{"text":"Most people really like this place but I can't say I'm a fan. The food is pretty good and they have decent prices on drinks but I've had some pretty poor service when I've been there. I'm never one to complain about service but it has always been very slow and on one occasion the server told us the wrong happy hour prices and we ended up being charged way more than we were told. Maybe I've just had bad luck here but personally I have not been too impressed."}
{"text":"The food was awesome. I got the Jamaican jerk chicken wrap. Drink deals are awesome. 2 for the price of one on Thursday nights. But the service ruined it for me.....they were standing around and only paying attention to certain customers. I probably won't be back.."}
{"text":"Come here basically every Wednesday night for trivia night! The host is lots of fun and recognizes the regulars who come.   Food is decent bar food, and beer on tap can satisfy a ton of different tastes. I'm on the light citrus-y end of that spectrum. Wigs are okay, pizza is good!   Parking is great for being so close to Mill! Will be back next Wednesday!"}
{"text":"Very nice! I had a great time here. The service is great & food is amazing! Had the bottomless mimosas I think it was til 2 pm or 3 pm, I forgot but I loved the taste of the mimosas. Also the vibrancy is enormous, outside is nice and inside is cool. Totally coming back here again!"}
{"text":"My favorite place in Tempe hands down!! I call it \"Cheers\" and they always know my name...and my drink! New menu items def make the food choices better. Think high end bar food without the gastropub douchebags. No hipsters here, just decent drink prices, good food and no pretensions. If in Tempe, give it a go!"}
{"text":"Yes, it's a college bar, but seriously it's on point with its food. I consider this the best place for a burger in Arizona. I get the Baja, and it's amazing! They also have multiple TVs to watch sports. The staff can be hit and miss sometimes, but the burgers are worth it."}
{"text":"Now Devil's is a fun bar - don't get me wrong. But I had a bad experience with a particular bartender with a nasty temperament.   I walked inside and went straight to the bar to order a drink. Of course, it was crowded because it was Saint Patty's Day. I'd been waiting for 10 minutes or so, and a guy walks up next to me, shakes hands with the bartender (not who I'm talking about) and gets his drinks right away. I wait for another 5 minutes or so, getting more frustrated. Then another guy walks up, super nice, finally gets the female bartender's attention. I believe her name is Lauren. He explained, \"These girls were here first\", so I quickly asked, \"Are you sure?\" and thanked him. Then the bartender  says, \"You lost your shot.\" and walks away from us without taking any drink orders... The guy was just trying to be nice... Couldn't believe we were treated in such a way."}
{"text":"This place has good bar food, okay service. Good place to come watch a game they have tons of tvs and a full bar w rotating beers on tap. I would recommend the Black and bleu burger or their wings!"}
{"text":"Great service, food & drinks!  Best college bar in Tempe by far!"}
{"text":"I was in town for a few days and went to Devils advocate for a drink and some food. We had the best waitress Avery who really made out trip memorable. We ended up coming back everyday just to see her before we had to leave. Will definitely be visiting Devils every time we are in town! Thanks for everything and all the advice on where to go Avery, best service ever!"}
{"text":"I am now a fan, after having a bad experience here, the owner read my review and sent me a very personal apology.  Thanks!  That was very considerate and will create more business for you!  Happy new year!!!       This place is great if you love unattentive, lazy, worthless bartenders. With four deadbeats behind the bar and only 10 people actually at the bar it should take less than 10 minutes to get a drink, not the case.  The waitress are little better.  The band  rocked!  Some dude puked right in the front dead center of the bar and everybody bailed off that end, these four genius'  had no idea.   It took almost 15 minutes before anyone even wiped the bartop muchless the floor which took another 10...  Suck..  but the band rocked!  Kung fu grip rules! Don't let this go to your heads boys but you suck as bartenders, stick to the roids.  Lazy and lame."}
{"text":"I decided to give this place a second chance and i was pleasantly surprised. The food was cooked very well and was delicious. The waitress i had was very attentive and my overall experience was a good one. I'll definitely be back for college football games this year. Go Sun Devil's!!"}
