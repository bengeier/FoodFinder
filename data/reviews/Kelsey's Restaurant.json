{"text":"Good burgers and fries.  They also have kettle chips.  Service is good and the menu range is fair.  Try the caramel brownie lava cake.  It's delicious!"}
{"text":"First time I went to Kelsey's was on a Thursday night which happened to their half price wings night ... Awesome isn't it? The service was great servers were humorous and provided great service and the wings were pretty good I recommend the honey garlic wings and the classic BBQ wings!

Most likely will come back to Kelsey's when I'm in the area"}
{"text":"Really? 10 minutes at the table before anyone acknowledges me? Watched others get seated and asked about drinks, but not me. Excuse was no one told the waitstaff I was here. I will see about the food."}
{"text":"I've been to this Kelseys a few times - always during off-hours (10pm-ish or later) and the service usually isn't great.

Verrrrrrrrrrry slow. Slow to take your orders, slow to get your drinks, slow to get your food, slow to get your bill.  The last time I went, It was almost 30 minutes in between ordering my drink and when I actually got it. I think it actually had been sitting on the bar for a while since some of the ice melted and made my drink more watered down - boo.

Kelsey's makes one of my FAVOURITE drinks in the world (Pineapple Express: Raspberry Sourpuss, Banana Liqueur, Spite, Pineapple Juice & Grenadine) which I am ALWAYS excited to order, but this watered down, thrown together version just sucked.

Food isn't too shabby, but after repeated visits with poor service, I will likely explore other late-night options when in the area."}
