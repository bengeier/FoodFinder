{"text":"I have been to the Hoosier Cafe twice. The first time I went it wasn't bad. However, the last time my husband and I went it was horrible. We both ordered buscuits and gravy and coffee. We both were so disappointed with our meals we sent them back. We never do this, but it was unedible! The gravy had no flavor and tasted like jellied milk. The coffee was also quite horrible, it tasted like dirty water. I then ordered blueberry pancakes and my husband ordered blueberry waffles. I really should have sent these back as well. The blueberries tasted rotten. Needless to see we will NEVER be returning here and wasting our money again!"}
{"text":"Massive servings! I had a skillet which made my eyes get super big when it came out. Seriously could have been 3 meals. Hubby had to help and we still had some left to take home. Potatoes on the skillet were fresh, moist and seasoned nicely so we saved the rest.
drinks were kept filled the whole time, Service was fast and friendly and the restaurant has nice big windows to let in light and allow you to look out while you chat and wait for the good food.
Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Well... It was OK... Food was nothing special and the atmosphere was fine. My problem was the bathroom situation - a single bathroom for each."}
{"text":"I'll be honest I was not impressed with the food. Very in seasoned and greasy. Service was slow. I also received a dirty water glass and silverware. This was my first and last visit. I give it 2 stars because the cost is low."}
{"text":"Best country breakfast in Chandler. Eggs were perfect ham was moist. Biscuits and gravy Awesome"}
{"text":"Huge portions. Great food. Good buttermilk pancakes which are getting harder to find. Great Omelettes. Been here at least 5 times. When in chandler we always make time for a visit here. Nothing too fancy except the Hoosier memorabilia. Clean and friendly and get the job done! Give it a try!"}
{"text":"You get a lot of food for a relatively cheap price and the service is great and fast.  The quality of the food though is only so-so.  You'll leave full but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"We were starving one Sunday morning at 5am after a night of fun, realizing our options were limited for the area .We waited for Hoosier to open at 6am and we're glad we did. We had omlettes and they were Perfect! Very great prices for portions. Our waitress was very attentive and the ambience was great . About 5 levels above a chain diner. I'd recommend this place for great breakfast food. I'm defiantly going back to try other things. Two thumbs up"}
{"text":"I brought my Mother there today expecting a cheap breakfast. While we were fed copious amounts of food, the bill was outrageous given their $ rating. $7.99 per omelet, no matter which one you choose. Every breakfast item was over $7.00. I was disappointed on price, but not on the quality of the food or the service.  Suggest Brunchies in downtown Chandler instead. Same portions, same service, a bit cheaper."}
{"text":"Seriously the best breakfast in town!!! I always get an omelette or breakfast burrito and a caramel iced coffee, yum!!!!"}
{"text":"I am downgrading my stars of what used to be my favorite breakfast place. Took a long time for a table, food delivery took a Lot longer than in the past. Food is decent but prices have gone up and I was charged. 1.50$ for extra hollandaise on my Benedict. Really? Outrageous and I don't pinch pennies. Looking for a new place."}
{"text":"Do u want a big breakfast at a great price? Look no further, I love this no chain breakfast joint. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The service, food, and prices are amazing! I love the burritos! Keep up the good work and I'll keep coming back!"}
{"text":"I grew up in the 60's and 70's in Michigan and I can say that the Hoosier cafe brought back memories.  Days when my dad and I used to sneak out of the house on Sunday for a great breakfast. The Gravy is thick and packed with sausage.  Eggs cooked perfectly, and Hash browns crispy on the outside and tender in the center. Oh and the bottomless cup of coffee!

Bring back memories from the old days..."}
{"text":"Looking for a good diner style breakfast?  If so, try this place.   After living back east for some time you get to appreciate food - diner style.  This place is all of that.  You can always tell a good breakfast by the number of people who are there or waiting to get in.  In fact the last time we tried to eat there we decided to pass as there was a line out the door of the place.   

When you do get inside you get all the feelings of a small town eatery.  Many patrons seem to be regulars.  The staff is very friendly and welcoming.   The portion size is good and speed of service is great.   Cost is reasonable as well.   

2 thumbs up !!!"}
{"text":"Every time that we have come here we always have amazing service and the food is the best. I love the chorizo!"}
{"text":"So I had to make a decision on breakfast pretty fast last Saturday morning.  It was between this place and another place within a mile of it.  I had already been to the other place a few times.  Cunundrum solved....NEW PLACE HERE I COME!!!

I get there and start looking around.  Looks like a pretty friendly crowd.  I'm waiting to get seated so I step outside and pick up a local free paper to look at while I'm waiting for food (you have to read something or be doing something if you're a single diner or it creeps people out).   So I look through the menu and decide on a Belgian Waffle with eggs and sausage.  I start reading the paper and looking around the place and I say to myself \"dude....place has got a lot of sports schwag on the walls\"  It just now hit me there was a good reason for this place being called Hoosier.  My only complaint (and the one that cost the place a 5th star) is that they sat me at a table for 4 people.....little conspicuous here people.

Anyhooo.  The gastronomic delivery specialist drops off a squeeze bottle of my syrup (it was kind of a clear-ish version of a ketchup bottle you see at hotdog places) and I thought to myself \"hey man...that's kinda cool\".  So a little while goes by and the food gets there.  It was a pretty big waffle with really deep waffle-divots which is good for filling up with the deep brown nectar.  The waffle was pretty good, the eggs were tasty and pretty fluffy, and the sausage patties did not dissapoint.  Oh yeah...before I forget...the syrup squeeze bottle they gave me was all nice and warm.  Really grubbin breakfast they had there!!

I think next time I go I'm gonna try the thing where they fry up corn-batter and bring it to you.  That sounds about as decadent as it gets.

{"text":"Love this place.  We've been there many times and the food and service is always excellent!   Not sure how it happens but for some reason we always seem to get seated in Marcus' section.  He's an awesome server."}
{"text":"As a resident of California I came to Arizona to visit family and friends over the holiday. Today is my last day in Chandler. Soon to be on a 5 hour drive home. I can't drive on an empty stomach, so I decided to try this place out. I order the steak breakfast burrito, and I must say it's quite filling. A white flour tortilla wraps the steak, fluffy potatoes, cheeder cheese, and caramelized onions all together. With a side of delicious salsa. A complete care package! If you're an \"on-the-go\" type person, I highly suggest ordering the steak burrito. And after enjoying it, take a quick nap before you hit the road."}
{"text":"My husband and I both ordered one of their skillets. The entrees were HUGE! Food was good, service was quick, and prices were very reasonable considering how much food they give you."}
{"text":"We've been a few times. I've tried different items. Waffle and egg breakfast is great. Biscuits and gravy are a great breakfast item too."}
{"text":"This morning I thought I would change it up a bit and eat at Hoosier Cafe in Chandler.  I ordered two eggs over medium with a ham steak and their Ranch potatoes. My waitress took my ordered and offered either diced green peppers, onions, or jalapeños.  I ordered my potatoes with the jalapeños and wheat toast buttered. Im a creature of habit and normally eat at Biscuits Cafe in Chandler, but thought this would be where to get a ham steak since they are an midwest style restaurant. Waitress brought my meal very fast. The ham steak  was a disappointment right off the bat, it was a small slice thin of ham, nothing close to a ham steak.  It wasn't a smoked ham steak as listed.  The eggs okay, but the Ranch potatoes very average. They reminded me of the end of fries ends over fried. Now I never order toast buttered because they always seem to lather them up with liquified butter. I did today don't know why and of course a piece of toast had a piece of hair or bristle from the brush used to apply the butter.  I said it was a hair and server went the brush route. Now the jalapeños were not fresh diced, but jalapeños from a can for nachos. 
So the breakfast was averaged and the server said that jalapeños were brought up from a previous customers as why not freshly diced? I then ordered oatmeal and it was okay, but my spoon brought to use was dirty. I took a pic to post.
I paid for my breakfast so don't think I voiced my concerns for a free or reduced breakfast.  The server was good, she kept my coffee full and hot and easy polite."}
{"text":"This is a family tradition for me......... breakfast everytime I come home to visit the parents.  
Classic midwestern diner, in the middle of the desert.
Loved the corn beef hash."}
{"text":"I had the steak omelet.  Wife had ham and cheese omelet. The cheese used on the omelets is tasteless. Keep trying to figure out why it had no taste. When the wife is pouring ketchup on the omelet just to have some sort of flavor it says alot. Not sure why people rave about the biscuits and gravy. If you like white sauce with minimal sausage and lots of pepper than go for it. Have come here a few times but not really top on list any more."}
{"text":"This place has the best waffle I have ever had and the meal portions are nice sized so you will never leave hungry.  The staff is always nice and I have never had a problem with service here.  I eat here often and plan to keep coming back for more."}
{"text":"Nice Hoosier decor and pricing as well. Very good breakfast and lunch offerings similar to the Midwest. 

I recommend it highly. Very freindly server and nice and clean atmosphere."}
{"text":"We have eaten here for years. You know they are very busy but very efficient. So, we decided to go there on Father's Day. After sitting there for 40 minutes after ordering, we still hadn't received our food. Everyone else that came in after us had already received theirs and were actually ready to leave. Our waitress finally went in to check on the food and we received it five minutes later. We thought ok they lost our order.   My daughter received bacon that wasn't cooked/raw so we requested if we could get it cooked a little longer so it wasn't raw. What they brought out was completely disgusting. It so hard to describe but it was so hot extremely crispy but black/gray looking.  To be honest, I have never seen bacon cooked like this. The color was so gray looking you probably wouldn't know it was bacon. I wouldn't have feed it to my dog. We asked to speak to the manager.  He absolutely did not care. His response was I don't know how long your food took and when asked if he would serve that bacon he said some people might like it.  Not how a manager should respond. we weren't looking for a free meal we just wanted to give feedback and someone to care.  It would have been nice for him to respond let me check into why your meal was so late and not been a jerk about the extremely burnt overcooked food that I can't imagine anyone would have eaten or that you would serve it that way..  I will not eat there again and would not recommend."}
{"text":"First time to visit this restaurant I tried the steak burrito from the breakfast menu and it was very delicious and priced right. Atmosphere inviting, clean and friendly. I am sure I'll be visiting Hoosier soon again."}
{"text":"Best breakfast EVER! I absolutely love this place. The customer service is great and the food is even better. We were seated immediately, got to choose our table and our server was attentive throughout the entire time. I would highly recommend enjoying a side of biscuits and gravy ;)"}
{"text":"We love this place the food and service is excellent.  It is very reasonable and quanities are huge, biscuits and gravy is very good. We have been going there for years .  You can not go wrong going there      Wes B"}
{"text":"First let me say that anyone giving this place more than 1 or 2 stars are either family members or friend  of the owners. I lived in Illinois and have been to Indiana numerous times and never have I had this bad of food. I went here for breakfast and order basic eggs, sausage, biscuits and gravy, hash browns. The biscuits were tiny, gravy is terrible, sausage and eggs were like I could have cooked at home. This place is comparable to places like denys and waffle house. If you like those places go to there and not here."}
{"text":"I don't know what to say other than the breakfast is really really good! It's  definitely a taste of where I grew up in the Midwest! Big portions of good quality homemade tasting everything. The service is always good as well and the place is busy but they always have it under control and we have never had to wait an unreasonable amount of time. One of my new favorite breakfast places for an occasional Sunday morning breakfast outing."}
{"text":"Veronica is a very nice yoing lady and a great waitress. Food is always great here and probably the cleanest restaurant I've ever seen."}
{"text":"What a sweet a little diner!  We we're here for a wedding and found this place on YELP. Shannon our waitress was bright and lively.  She seemed genuinely happy to be there and excited to have us there.  My wife got the Belgian waffle with a side of bacon and it was awesome!  Really good flavor.  You can add just about anything to it but she just got a plain one and loved it.  
I got the country fried steak and eggs with the biscuits and gravy on the side. Again it was really good.  I couldn't finish my meal which is a rare phenomenon.  Great place, great food, great staff."}
{"text":"As a Hoosier, it was imperative for me to go, and I was quite pleased.

Great food, great service - and be sure to get there early on the weekends, there is usually a line.

Corned beef hash is homemade and great, burgers are great too."}
{"text":"Nice family owned restaurant is welcome among a sea of chains.  Today I had poached eggs, ranch potatoes and rye toast.  One of my eggs was undercooked but everything else was very good."}
{"text":"You have to try this place. Absolutely amazing food, service and atmosphere. I love this little mom-and-pop cafe where everyone is so friendly. The food tastes so original. We love their breakfast menu. Waffles are home-made and taste delicious!!"}
{"text":"I ate at the \"Hoosier Cafe\" in Chandler, AZ.  The decor makes you think that you really are in Indiana.  A very friendly staff provided good service.  I would love to go again."}
{"text":"I found this place in the Nick of time,  my wife just had our baby, and while waiting for my mother in law, I went to get breakfast at the hospital and it was closed, thank goodness or else I would have missed our on this good food. Staff was friendly, on recommendation would be more variety of creamers."}
{"text":"For the first time in a while I was out of the house really early, too early for the meeting I had scheduled. So to pass time I decided to get some breakfast. 
I had been wanting to try the Hoosier Cafe. It is always packed! 
I found a table right away. The water is good (not very common). I ordered 2 eggs, hash browns, sausage and chose biscuits and gravy over toast. DUH. 
The eggs, which I ordered basted, were perfectly cooked. The hash brows were wonderfully crunchy without being burnt (like my last breakfast experience). The sausage was a patty and was good but a bit oily. The star was the biscuits and gravy. It is a huge portion. The biscuits are soft and the gravy was thick and peppery. 
The servers are too cute. The whole atmosphere takes you right to small town America. 

I will return!"}
{"text":"This is a great casual family diner, everything a diner should be. Incredibly fast service, super friendly attitude, wholesome delicious food, variety galore and reasonable prices. I really enjoyed eating breakfast here and would recommend it without hesitation. And where else could you try gourmet corn mush infused with bacon and other goodies?! Go Hoosiers!!"}
{"text":"So good!! If you are a midwesterner or you just love hearty feel good breakfast food you have to go here!! Biscuits and gravy did not disappoint. Service was spot on and there was Indiana stuff on the walls to look at while you wait to dig in. Also, plenty of parking and plenty of seating."}
{"text":"I was visiting from Chicago and my Padre took me here. I get it its midwestern food. I had Chorizo and eggs it came with Potatoes and you can choose either toast or biscuits and gravy...AWESOME! I love biscuits and gravy and the fact that I can get it with my meal at no additional charge is even better. My only problem was that the waitress was kinda a B-word. She was all upset cause I didnt finish my food. Come on lady...I dont stay skinny eating a pounds of Chorizo, eggs, potatoes, and biscuits and gravy. Though that would be nice."}
{"text":"By far one of the best breakfast locations in chandler."}
{"text":"This is a greasy spoon, diner, local hang out place that I usually really enjoy.  The few times I have gone I wasn't that impressed with the food and it's extremely loud in here every time I go.  Which i think is how diners should be except it's really much louder than you would expect.  The waitresses are nice and seem to know everyone which is always good to find.  The few things I have ordered to eat have all been pretty bland and not very good.  The Blueberry pancakes seem to have real blueberries but they are very tough and \"chewy\" not sure how that actually happens.  Usually blueberries in pancakes are the opposite.  The pancake itself was very tough and pretty bland.  I can't really recommend them.  I have also had an omelet before and it was good nothing to write home about.  So if you stop in I would stay away from the pancakes."}
{"text":"Decent food for good prices, ordered the spinach omelette it was very bland, but the amount of food that came in the plate made up for it, hash browns and biscuits and gravy were alright, the waffles are delicious though!"}
{"text":"A favorite of one of my cousins,  Diana Trimmer, and I can see why.  Ordered the ham and cheese omelet. Huge portions and spot on great."}
{"text":"Now THIS is breakfast!

Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day and I've always believed that breakfast should be hearty to get you jump started. Hoosier Cafe does just that. If you want a \"stick to your ribs\" kind of meal, Hoosiers' the place.

The establishment is decked out in all things Indiana & Hoosiers. It has that old school \"Denny's\" charm about it. I found Hoosier Cafe to be clean and comfortable to be in.

Warning, if you are a health nut, your options might me quite limited to a fruit cup or maybe oatmeal (not sure if I saw that on the menu). Let your guard down and indulge in some biscuits & gravy or a stack of hotcakes! Feeling edgy? Kill a chicken fried steak & eggs!

It's \"slap-yo-mama\" GOOD!!!"}
{"text":"Can you say small town diner? It is truly like a small town diner at small town diner prices.  That said, I called it a diner for a reason.  I am not even sure if they serve fruit and vegetables (joking of course). Great breakfast that is nice on the wallet. Be careful though, it can get crazy busy for breakfast,  especially on the weekends. I always feel, why go to Denny's or IHop when you have a place like this."}
{"text":"What can I say? MEH.

It's a diner themed to Indiana.  I'm amazed that they stay in business with that theme, but what the hey.

The food is normal diner food, good and greasy, I love that old diner feel.  They have that (in my opinion) disgusting biscuits & gravy, which is designed to make Hooiser's the fattest people on earth.  I had bacon and eggs as I'm not Hoosier, I'm just a captive there.

This place is ok, but I won't go there again.  I was brought here as a joke because I was visiting from Indiana.  There is nothing here that I can't get at 10,000 other places in Phoenix, except high cholesterol."}
{"text":"Basic no frills diner, lots of seating and extremely attentive service.  For $12 I had two perfectly cooked eggs, four quality sausage patties, crispy hash browns, biscuits and sausage pepper gravy which was adequate and a very good ginormous pancake with unlimited coffee.  I shall return!"}
{"text":"Our favorite breakfast place...price is good and you get a big portion of food. Their biscuits and gravy are the best!"}
{"text":"This reviews exclusively for Veronica, our server at Hoosiers today. Hoosiers is not as good as it used to be hence the reason we don't go there is often anymore ,the prices have gone way up the food quality has gone down, today was kind of an example of that. I ordered eggs benedict, not only did it to take a long time for our food to come, but when it did, my poached eggs were poached hard and only a dribble of Hollandaise sauce on my Benedict, both of these items are what make eggs benedict good, soft poach and ample amounts of good Hollandaise. I don't like to complain because then it will take even longer for them to replace my food. Veronica came by and asked us how our food was, I answered fine, she looked and  noticed that my eggs were hard and said oh my God they over-cooked your eggs, I will be right back. She returned with two perfectly good poached eggs and an additional side of hollandaise sauce. Veronica is truly an amazing server and should probably be running the place. Attention to detail is what matters and what turned our experience from mediocre to awesome!
Veronica is the reason we will return!"}
{"text":"We love diner breakfast. We don't want fancy. We want good food at a good price and good service. Is that too much to ask? Apparently not, because Hoosier Cafe blew us away today! 

We went for brunch with a few friends. We arrived at 11am on Saturday and the place was jumping. I mean - every table filled with both patrons and food.  So we waited patiently and checked out the decor. Vinny and Mary were with us and went to college in IN so they pointed out their fav college pennants on the wall.  Nostalgia time :)

Then the menu. Cute.  They have a \"you know you are a Hoosier if...\" list except.....we are yinzers from the 'burgh and 2/3's of that list applied to us as well. So I guess that lends credibility to the theory that the 'burgh is Midwest, not Mid-Atlantic LOL

Anyway as soon as we are seated, we are immediately greeted by the server who takes drink orders. Considering how packed the house was, that was pretty impressive. Now comes the sweet part: we had our orders within 12 minutes of when we were seated. Amazing, given how busy they were. And each order was absolutely perfect.

I went for the mush.  Really. I love mush. A childhood favorite carried into adulthood.  The order was - well, why mince words - ginormous.  I couldn't even finish it all which was fine because DH was nibbling on it anyway.  Crispy outside, soft inside. Perfection. And - believe it or not - they made me crispy bacon. Not burnt. Not dry and tough. Perfectly crispy.

DH had the Cali omelet.  It was overstuffed and yet he managed to eat it all.  Seriously, it was not only full of cheese and bacon with a healthy portion avocado, it came with ranch taters and toast.  I can honestly say that it is the only omelet in the valley that rivals one of our other fav breakfast places.  Now these two places could have a throwdown!

The rest of the table had omelets, egg breakfasts, and one daring soul had a benedict who pronounced it excellent!  

And the best part:  we never wanted for coffee - it was hot and always refilled!

So the scorecard says:
Price:  5 stars
Quality:  5 stars
Service:  5 stars
Cleanliness:  5 stars

This is a permanent part of the rotation now!"}
{"text":"If you like a water downed coffee and tiny portion sizes, this is the spot for you!
And what is up with the corner table where one person stares in the wall?"}
{"text":"I do not understand the hype at all. I've been wanting to try this place out for a while as they are always busy when I drive by. Finally stopped in with my mom for breakfast this morning. Their menu was basic. Nothing jumped out but I love breakfast burritos so venturing to this part of the menu I wanted to see what they had for the non meat eater. The only choice was egg and cheese, no veggies. So i asked if that was something that could be done and they were very accommodating (at a .75 cent charge per added topping not disclosed to me). It's fine, that's what I wanted and if it was good then no problems. My mom ordered eggs Benedict classic style with potatoes. We waited just a bit and received our food in a good amount of time. My burrito looked great the eggs Benny to. First bite of mine, bland, so the salsa was a saviour. Wasn't bad just very lacking on flavor and seasoning. My mom's eggs Benedict was worse, the ham was tough was the poached eggs were still soaked with water like they hadn't been drained but spooned. The sauce was thick and lacked flavor along with the potatoes that were boarder line mash with no browning on them or seasoning. The waitress didn't ask once how the meal was so we cut or losses, paid the bill and won't return."}
{"text":"My wife had the Garden Skillett with 2 fried eggs on top, and I had the Florentine Benedict. The food is pretty good and the staff is friendly. I noticed that they have a lot of regular guests/customers. Half the people coming in the door were greeted by name. They are only open between 6am to 2pm as they are only open for breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"Breakfast or Lunch this place has it covered in spades. You better be hungry!! OMG the
Portions are huge! Not for the faint of heart make sure you come here with hearty appetite. The biscuits and gravy he are to die for the best son I've had around town definitely worth stopping here for."}
{"text":"My husband and I come here occasionally with his parents for a nice hearty breakfast on the weekend. We always can expect great service and full stomachs. I usually opt to get an omelette of some sort and am never unsatisfied. It does get busy here though, so be prepared to wait on a weekend morning."}
{"text":"I really want to love this place since it is so close to my house but this is the last freaking straw! I ordered food to go this morning and there is a hair in my food! This is the 2nd time this has happened! Does the cook not wear a hair net!? Just gross!"}
{"text":"The service is awesome.  Clean...my husband ordered ham steak. But he got a cut  piece of can ham. I ordered a simple breakfast  a waffle and sausage. I eat it all....I think I would come back.  And a cute puppy reminds me of my baby coco at home.  But yes visiting Chandler Arizona come have breakfast here."}
{"text":"Good for pancakes, not for eggs.  Service was great, very friendly and my coffee cup was never empty, which is unheard of.  The omlettes were under seasoned, and the eggs yolks in the Benedict were? hard cooked rather than running."}
{"text":"So, I've been trying to check this place out for awhile. I love b-fast, almost as much as staying up late and sleeping in, so it did take me awhile to check it out before they closed at two (my average wake up time). In fact I arrived right at two, which having been a server, I know sucks. Our server Marci was super nice and welcomed us in anyway, without even one look of contempt, which I know is what I would have delivered had I been serving a table at closing time. The food was delicious, and it being a \"fuck it\" day, ordered bacon wholeheartedly. It was the most delicious, thick cut bacon I've had. And the rest of the meal was delicious and reasonably priced. Next time I'm awake early (or up late) I'll be back."}
{"text":"Friendly staff seemed to actually enjoy their job. Very prompt service.

 Place was packed and yet we were seated quickly. Food came out and served quickly

Adequate portions and great tasting food! 

Only downside was only one bathroom so had a 3 person wait for mens a room"}
{"text":"This place is great for breakfast i have been here several times and i always get the spinach omelet, which is delicious. My husband has had the skillet, chicken fried steak and meat lover omelet and has always been good. They definitely bring a lot of food for you, portions are huge! 

The wait time was accurate,  they said 10 minutes and it was. The staff and server's are friendly, never a bad experience. Today is mothers day and we expected a longer wait for seating and for food. Food came out within 15 minutes today and was great as usual.

All in all another good experience...i really like the consistency of quality and service."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for breakfast. I am into local/mom & pop places and this diner offers a variety of dishes at really affordable prices. The waitstaff are friendly and service is good and food quality is good. It gets quite packed with early birds towards the end of the week but the wait isn't too bad , if you have to wait."}
{"text":"My date and I ate here after church yesterday and the other Yelpers were +SO+ right! The biscuits and gravy are out of this world! The omelets were fantastic and the portions were \"farm size\". The service was efficient and the place was clean. I will be back!

A solid 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Great family diner. Reminds me of the ones back east or in small town America. Great  food, good prices, super staff. This one is a gem in a town of overpriced chain look alike restaurants."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast this morning, delicious food and great service. Prices were just right and portions were huge! We will most definitely be back! My dad especially enjoyed his corned beef hash! My chicken fried steak was yummy!"}
{"text":"Me and a group of friends meet every Sunday for breakfast. We always rotate around to different restaurant's to keep it interesting. Hoosier Cafe was one of our stops. We now have added Hoosier to one of our regular stops. The food is good, friendly staff and the prices are reasonable. If they were closer to where I live I probably would be eating there every week."}
{"text":"Tried Hoosier Cafe for the first time and was pleased with the overall breakfast experience. Ample private parking and seating within the restaurant. The wait wasn't too long for a weekend morning. I ordered the short stack pancakes and coffee. Great taste and decent portion for a short stack. There are private bathrooms which is a plus, and the women's restroom had a changing table. They got our drink order right away and our service was overall great and friendly. Would come here again. The waitress also suggested several items like the Denver omelet or anything on the griddle menu."}
{"text":"Great place to get breakfast. 2nd weekend in a row. Prices are fair and the food is great. Friendly staff and fast service."}
{"text":"Dad brought me here for breakfast as I was visiting him from SoCal. We came here on a Saturday morning there was definitely a wait of about twenty minutes. Obviously we came here during peak hours but I have seen waits much worse. 

Service was great here, she keep the coffee filled the whole time we were there. In fact I couldn't even get past half a cup without it being filled. So what did I eat? Well I had to go full ham on this one and get the Loaded Biscuits and Gravy, Its basically biscuits and gravy with sausage between the biscuits. It was great and if you want to walk out full till dinner eat this thing! Only thing I felt was that they could have done more with it, especially if you are calling it loaded. 

My wife grabbed her usual eggs benedict and said it was good. So all around a great spot to check out if you are a local or someone visiting the area. I would return here if I lived in the area for sure. All we need now is some mimosas up in the place. CHEERS!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had a breakfast date here and loved every second of it.  The place was very busy, but someone was waiting to show us a table immediately.  I ordered the traditional Eggs Benedict and they were cooked to perfection for me.  I ate every bite!  My husband ordered Eggs over medium and they came over easy, too runny for his liking.  He also had the biscuits and gravy which were delicious.  The plates were full and the food was fabulous.  We will go back!"}
{"text":"Hoosier's Cafe delivers EVERY TIME.  Everything I've had is fantastic, the service is extremely fast and pleasant, and the prices are very reasonable. In the top breakfast restaurants I've been to in AZ since I moved here 8 years ago/"}
{"text":"Solid spot for a good breakfast. It was crowded for a weekday morning but I'll take that as a good sign. The service was great, every employee was friendly and had a smile on their face and our coffee was never empty. Which is a big selling point for me when it comes to breakfast. Price is also great for the portion sizes here! Only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because our food came our warm, but not hot, so by the time I was half way done eating it was about room temp which was kind of disappointing. But we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We come for breakfast almost every weekend and it never fails. The french toast is amazing."}
{"text":"I was in today for late breakfast. I am a regular and I love the food. I always get my standby breakfast bacon and eggs. The best bacon in town and I love that you get biscuits and gravy at no extra charge. With that being said, in the past not only was the food great but so was the service. Today, the food was great the service was not. My server was Shawna in the back end of the restaurant. I watched people from 2 different tables get up and refill their own coffee and iced tea. If there had been a soda machine out front I would have refilled my own drink also, but there isn't so I didn't.  I miss the old staff as I have noticed a couple of the girls have left. Bring back that big girl, can't remember her name but she was funny and efficient."}
{"text":"Hoosiers is the best breakfast place. I've been here several times and the quality and service remain consistent, even when they are super busy. I always order corned beef hash , 2 eggs, hashbrowns (they can add onions, bell peppers, and cheese to them for no charge, I highly recommend doing this!), and a biscuit with gravy (also no extra charge for the biscuit and gravy instead of toast). My husband also enjoys his food. He orders the chicken fried steak skillet. He also likes the patty melt. We highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Luckily I live close by . . . so I go there as often as time permits. Excellent food and service. The serving portions are too generous, but take left overs home. Only serve breakfast and lunch but they do it right ! Midwest hospitality and just a real down to earth comfortable place. Breakfast is probably my fav . . . and there is none better."}
{"text":"I have no idea how they ever received a 4 star rating. This place was below mediocre first of all it had a very distinct smell in the whole restaurant and it was not a very appetizing one that's for sure. Secondly the server only came by twice once to get our order and the second time to bring out the food, she never bothered checking up on us or anything we actually had to flag someone else down just to get a refill. The food was ok I ordered two blueberry pancakes with an egg and bacon as well as a half order of the biscuits and gravy. The pancakes tasted as if they used a Bisquick mix and tossed in some unripe blueberries which was very disappointing because I usually LOVE pancakes out. The biscuits and gravy on the other hand were much better but still not good enough to bring me back . John had the country fried steak and gravy served with hashbrowns and eggs. He said the country fried steak itself wasn't bad but not his favorite, the hashbrowns despite having them topped with cheese, onions, peppers and jalapenos were very bland and needed a good dash of salt. Overall you would be much more satisfied going to your neighborhood Denny's than Hoosier Cafe in my opinion."}
{"text":"I am so glad I finally made it over here to try Hoosier Café.  GREAT breakfasts!  The first time I went by myself and had the half Belgian waffle breakfast.  That was the perfect amount of food.  Then I took my husband back and we loaded up and tried a couple of things.  I had a delicious California omelet with fresh avocado, and the B & G were old school.  Soft, fluffy biscuits and peppery sausage gravy.  That's the way it should be done.  

I've seen the same servers both times and they seem like they've worked together a long time.  Like a well-oiled machine they take care of everybody with a smile.  

As a side benefit I got a huge kick out of the table of geriatric regulars reading from the newspaper and talking politics.  Our world needs more of that.  One dude was eyeballing me the time I was there alone.  I figured I was either in his usual seat (which is more likely the reason) or he was wondering if I'd be offended by their comments about Hillary Clinton.  Heck no!  Comment away!  It's a free country.  Well, for now anyway.  Unless you have a dissenting  opinion on certain topics, or try to carry a plastic bag around in Bisbee.  

Reasonable prices, great service, stimulating conversation, and excellent food!  I may have found my new favorite breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Today I visited for breakfast. I had the steak omelet. I was surprised to find that it was very flavorful, cheesy, and had a very good amount of steak. 

This was my 2nd visit to the cafe. The first time, I just had sausage and eggs which were okay but I was not impressed. Trying it again today made me say I would go back. 

Worth a try, and really good IF you order the right thing..."}
{"text":"My family, girlfriend and I came in here for breakfast, mainly because my girlfriend being an IU Hoosiers fan and being from the midwest made her feel a little more at home here. Well don't feel shy to check it out even if you're not a midwest native, this place is a must try.

You can not go wrong here if you're looking for a place with heaping portions. The portion sizes for the cheap prices is unreal! Nobody at the table left hungry! Try the Ranch Potatoes if you're looking to not eat for 3 days, and be prepared for the waitress to ask if you want onion and peppers to jazz it up a bit. Fantastic biscuits and gravy are served here as well, if you arent looking to make a meal out of it, order them in place of your toast (its an option that doesn't cost extra)! Breakfast burritos about the size of a newborn, and omelettes fit for a king. 

Service is pretty quick, but be prepared for a packed house, with a morning crowd on the weekends. The walls are decorated in anything and everything Indiana sports memorabilia.The walls are literally all glass so it can get bright but also adds some personality and for a better scenery than your basic view of a painted wall. Looking for a new breakfast spot, check this place out!"}
{"text":"This is our go-to place when we want a friendly, delicious, well-priced breakfast.  The food is consistently good, the wait staff is always friendly and most of them remember us and our favorite orders.  Prices are reasonable and the portion sizes are more than you'd expect.
The atmosphere is pleasant and warm.  Always plenty of smiling faces and we always see the same patrons week to week.  That should tell you something!
It does get busy and occasionally there is a wait.  But where can you go in the East Valley in Winter and not have to wait?
Pretty much tried every breakfast item on the menu over the years...never had anything disappointing or less than fantastic. 

Give them a try...you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"So much good food! It's my second time here, and the last two times the food was so good that we ordered seconds to try other items! I'll definetly be back to try everything they have!"}
{"text":"What an amazing experience at Hoosiers. The waitress was amazing, she truly knows how to treat customers and made us feel like we have been eating there for years. But in fact it was our first visit. The food was great as well. The chicken fried steak was on point. Tender and well flavored."}
{"text":"Food was good!! Waffle was everything I was expecting!! Service by waitress ruined the whole experience. So disappointed in the way my family & I were treated. The busser was so friendly & helpful but our waitress should find a new job. Will return to support local small business and good breakfast spot but will not sit in her section."}
{"text":"I met a friend here for breakfast this morning. We arrived shortly after 8 and although they were busy we were seated in under a minute. The menu is classic diner food with a fairly large selection of items to choose from. I ordered a ham and cheese omelette with hash browns and at my friends urging chose the biscuits and gravy as my other side instead of toast. She had some sort of biscuits and gravy dish that included eggs and sausage. The servings are huge! Both of left about half of our meals on the the plate because there was so much. This was my first experience with biscuits and gravy and it wasn't bad unfortunately the gravy also ended up covering my hash browns on the plate so I couldn't truly enjoy them as they got mushy.

The service here from the hostess to the server was great. They are fast and friendly and very helpful. Breakfast for two with beverages was under $25.00 which was a great deal considering how much food there was."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast with a group. Service was fast and hot. I had the 1/2 waffle and added pecans(in the batter) and it came with a choice of egg & meat. I had the bacon which was thick and smoky. The coffee was good, just wish they would have filled it more. The group had a variety of food and it all looked good. I will come back. They took credit cards and the parking lot was easy to find a spot.They also gave us individual checks, which is a plus in my book with a group. This place is in a strip mall, I think called Palm Court."}
{"text":"Good wholesome food. Open daily from 6 am to 2 pm. Great for breakfast. Had the basic eggs, hash browns, crispy bacon and toast for about $7. More than enough for one person. Saw their skillets and they are huge portions. The waffles are amazing. Service was great.  Friendly and they know their regulars. They have been recommended by several people I know and now I know why."}
{"text":"I like this place because it's close to work so when I have a early meeting come over for a meal."}
{"text":"I am a huge breakfast fan. When I see lots of positive reviews for breakfast, I have to try them. 

I don't know if we ordered wrong or what, but we were not impressed AT ALL! My husbands burger was flat out disgusting. It was some preformed frozen beef-like product. 

The biscuits were bland and very floury. The chicken fried steak was average. Service was good but nothing outstanding. 

I'll be honest, it wasn't good enough that we would even bother trying it again."}
{"text":"This place is a great place for traditional American breakfast! None of that weird fufu stuff here. The portions are huge and the food is excellent. Traditional home style breakfast! Get there early because there usually is a line but it moves fast."}
{"text":"Sitting near a table of older patrons at Hoosiers this weekend, I listened to them decipher the HDTV conversion in the way only seniors can. Did they need to get cable? Was a converter box free? One was paying for hers. One had a box and cable... 

Of course I chuckled, but understood what they weren't saying. Why does something as easy as TV have to be so complicated- or expensive? I say the same thing about breakfast.

I guess that's why we were all at Hoosiers. Good, solid.breakfasts. Fast, friendly service. And all for under $10."}
{"text":"Clean restaurant.  Fast service.  Good breakfast.

I only had the oatmeal but it was good and cheap.  The iced tea was fresh.

My friend had bacon (looked thick and perfectly cooked), eggs and hashbrowns.

I recommend!"}
{"text":"Good food just a little pricey.  Good friendly service. Food is straight forward. I just had a simple ham & cheese omelette that was great.  Lots of Indiana memorabilia."}
{"text":"I don't think I've ever had a worst breakfast. I had the Mexican Scramble. It was nothing more than a pile of near raw potatoes with s small amount of tasteless chorizo on top. I had 2 biscuits on the side, that were not cooked in the center. My wife had the chicken fried steak and potatoes... same thing . A thin tasteless chicken patty laid atop a huge pile of near raw potatoes. This is the second time leaving a post/review because the first one somehow magically disappeared. I also posted pictures but they too are gone. There were lots of people waiting outside for tables. There are so many good reviews for this place, so i don't understand my experience. I guess some people really have no idea what good food taste like. @hoosiercafe #hoosiercafe"}
{"text":"I really like this place. The food is pretty decent too.   Its not fancy; and yes; theres better breakfast places; but you cannot beat the breakfast for the buck.  I dare you to find omlettes that size with the portions of potatos for that price.  Its packed on weekend mornings; but not too bad of a wait.  This is best bang for your buck breakfast place in Chandler.  If youre looking for a good breakfast without spending a lot of $$; this is the place."}
{"text":"This is my go to breakfast spot. Get here early on the weekends before the church crowd comes in. Chicken fried steak is excellent"}
{"text":"Great food, huge portions, really decent prices. 
As the son of two Hoosiers I felt at home. Really"}
{"text":"Was an awful experience ended up wanting chorizo and eggs. When I got it for some reason it was on the side and not even mixed in ended up not wanting it because that's the whole point of chorizo and eggs and returning it then the manager/owner only discounted 5 dollars off plus the service was garbage I think her name was Consuela."}
{"text":"The best breakfast joint in Chandler! Their waffles are amazing and the coffee is so good, I drink it black!! Great local cafe with excellent prices too!"}
{"text":"Tried this place awhile back and it didn't have anything really that was memorable. Everything seemed just ok. I had a Denver omelet with hashbrowns and toast. My husband had some kind of spanish omelet with biscuits and gravy as his side and english muffin. The waitress brought me the wrong meal but quickly corrected it. However, she really didnt seem very friendly throughout the entire meal. Anyways, like I said, my meal was ok and the hubby said his was ok as well but did say that the gravy tasted canned. The prices were reasonable and their menu had alot of choices. Because of this, I would go again and just try something else and I would go later in the afternoon as it seems like there would be a wait by going earlier. Hope to be able to write a more positive update about this place in the future as it seems to be a hit with many other people."}
{"text":"Service was great, food was even better. I had a Denver omelet, hash browns, and  biscuits and gravy (for a side, instead of toast for no extra cost). everything was delicious of course, but I do have a soft spot for some good biscuits and gravy and these were great! 

My boyfriend had French toast with eggs and sausage on the side, the French toast was great, but in comparison to mine he was a little jealous

Server was a quick, no-nonsense type of lady, and I mean that in the best way possible. She was efficient, made sure we were doing well, but also friendly at the same time! 
 
I would definitely recommend this place for a nice atmosphere (feels like it has been there forever) and even better breakfast food!! 

Going back sometime this weekend, I will definitely update!"}
{"text":"First I'll say if I could give half stars this would be a 3.5 rating, but I just can't bring myself to give it a full 4.  We ended up  here when the only thing that sounded good to my hangover was grits. So I got the grits with a side of gravy and a cup of fruit to take it easy on my poor stomach.  The grits were good, better than Waffle House or The Cracker Barrel, and the gravy went well with it. The fruit was disgusting, it tasted like it had been soaking in the juices of one of those gross fruit cups you get with nasty cafeteria food, none of it tasted even remotely like it was supposed to (cantaloupe, honeydew, pineapple all tasted exactly the same = awful). My bf got the chicken and waffles, which he enjoyed. The chicken strips are certainly not what you expect when you think chicken and waffles but delicious none the less. Overall not a bad experience, just stay away from the fruit! (seriously.)"}
{"text":"I was so nervous about this place as I don't go to too many diners but once I had their biscuits and gravy I was done! It was far better than I expect it would of been. Will return"}
{"text":"Hoosiers is my favorite breakfast spot in Phoenix. The grits are great: but the star of the show for me is the waffles! EAT THE WAFFLE! Even if you don't normally like waffles. 

They do make their hot chocolate with water so I would avoid."}
{"text":"Our new favorite go to spot for breakfast. Friendly and fast service has impressed me both times we've eaten here. The omelettes and country potatoes are really yummy. The coffee is kept refilled and good."}
{"text":"Shannon gave us great service! My husband and I split the meat lovers omelette and it was very tasty! The coffee, however, was the best cafe coffee I've had! Super smooth and buttery flavored to me. I normally only have one cup or just steal sips from my husbands coffee but not this time, I had 3 full cups! Something that has never happened before. The pancakes looked amazing as well. I'll have to try them one of theses days."}
{"text":"I came here based on the help ratings but I do not understand why it earned 4.5 stars. I must have missed something. 
Food:
I ordered their most popular breakfast, the chicken fried steak. The steak, itself was decent but the gravy was thin and tasteless (tasted and looked canned.) The 2 eggs on the side were overcooked. The yolks were runny as I asked but the whites were cooked brown, dry, and rubbery. The potatoes were also tasteless. They were probably purchased frozen and reheated.
Service:
Service was good initially. We were seated quickly, we have our drink orders, and then our food orders quickly. Then, after our food arrived the server gave my wife and I second glasses for our drinks (took up slot of room on our table.) I did not realize at the time but this indicated that we would never see her again. 
Our drinks ran dry by no refill came. You pay at a register up front so I never saw her again.
Ambiance: 
Decorations were fun and comfortable. No mistaking this was the Hoosier Cafe because pennants and jerseys were hanging wall to wall."}
{"text":"This is my staple new breakfast spot in chandler.service is great ,portions are huge,amd breakfast is amazing everytime we go.i usually order the french toast amd pancakes with eggs and ham or bacon and i love it.my boyfriend enjoys waffles and they are colossal.cute ambience."}
{"text":"One of our breakfast staples.  Love the biscuits and gravy and the waffles are to die for.  Never leave hungry.  At times there may be a wait, but it never takes much time to get seated.  It won't take long for the waitresses to recognize you and become familiar with your preferences.  Be sure to ask for your country potatoes to have onions and peppers added.  Coffee is always flowing and it isn't uncommon to begin a conversation with someone at another table.  Everyone is friendly and you can tell that they enjoy working there.  I'd say my only issue is that they have Purdue stuff displayed -- I'm an Indiana grad!"}
{"text":"Ordered a patty-melt. It was barely warm, cheese not melted, onions not grilled well.   Fries were so salty I couldn't eat them.  I ordered ranch dressing on the side.  It was like the cheapest kind you see at the grocery store kind of yellow and waxy.  The manager offered to make me something else and tried to make me happy so he is a good manager, but I didn't feel like staying.  

It's clean and the staff is nice.  It's just not what I was looking for."}
{"text":"I grew up in NE Indiana until I was 18 and this place definitely has mid-west styled meals. Great food, unique atmosphere, and great prices. I've taken my family and many of my friends and everyone really likes it and asks me to take them back. This place is hands down my favorite place to get breakfast."}
{"text":"A Good trust worthy spot for a home cooked breakfast. Large portions and good food!! Coffee is a little weak but I'm just a coffee snob :-)"}
{"text":"First time dining and left with a new favorite restaurant. Extremely delicious food and great service!"}
{"text":"Breakfast at eleven on a Sunday morning.  Looked pretty crowded for a spot for the 4 of us.  Put our name on the waiting list as they said 15 to 20 minutes.  After 10 minutes they seated us!  Good start.  The tables and floors appeared clean. Big menu to go through but all well described choices.  We all ordered different dishes.  I had a full order of biscuits and gravy with a side of hash browns.  My wife had a chicken fried beefsteak smothered in sausage gravy, with hash browns and 2 fried eggs and a small side of biscuits and gravy. Our friends ordered a traditional Benedict (toasted English muffin topped with grilled Canadian bacon, 2 poached eggs and Hollandaise sauce) and pancakes.  Everything was very good.  I thought the gravy could have had a bit more pepper and sausage in it.  Portions were quite generous, good value and real home style cooking.  The ice water had an off taste but their coffee was rich in flavor and refilled frequently.  A good breakfast that was sure to \"stick to your ribs\"!  We will return again as we have before.  A four star breakfast for sure."}
{"text":"Great service, decent food.  Very average food options but a fun place to eat :) Took me back to the Midwest for a meal.  Oh, and that Wisconsin cheese!!"}
{"text":"Love the friendly staff, fun mix of customers and simple good food. Neighborhood spot that has a lot of regulars. Eggs always prepared the way I ask and that's a HUGE make or break for me"}
{"text":"Good biscuits and gravy and pretty good omelettes.  The ranch potatoes weren't very good, not sure if the hashbrowns are better.  Either way it's a good breakfast for the price."}
{"text":"Food is always great. However the service was horrible. Maybe it was just the waitress we had but service this time was horrible."}
{"text":"My choice every Sunday. The food is good and it's a good friendly environment. My favorite is the Denver Omelette."}
{"text":"Great food great atmosphere and great people make for an awesome breakfast/lunch spot right off Arizona Ave and Warner Road in Chandler.  

Fast,  friendly and best of all quality ingredients and food. 

I highly recommend the Moo,  Cluck,  Oink Burger,  one of the best burgers I have ever had.  Bacon,  fried egg,  and cheddar cheese, all on a  toasted roll,  and do yourself a favor and get the fresh onion rings.  Mmmmm

Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Love it. Giant portions. You get a choice of biscuits and gravy or toast! Hello..Biscuits please! I had a Spanish omelet was huge and delicious. Service was wonderful and people were friendly. Gets really busy on weekend though. Cost is great for what you get. Will be going back."}
{"text":"This is a great diner and the people were very nice. They really try to keep the place clean, frequently wiping windows and cleaning the tables and booths. Our server was super sweet and attentive but didn't hassle us with constant interruptions. 

Had the Spanish omelet with country potatoes (get it extra crispy!!). Geez, the chorizo on and in that omelet is amaaazing. They could serve a bowl of just the chorizo and it would be a best seller.  You get bread or biscuits with gravy. The gravy is kind of bland to me but the biscuits were big and fluffy! Big portions and all for pretty well under $10. I didn't even finish it. 

My bf got the steak omelet with hash and bread. He had onions and peppers added in the hash but be forewarned: they put a ton! I had to scoop some on my own plate. 

We also got a small order of French toast. Was good but would be great had we had it warm (and wasn't stuffed from our respective omelets). 

Great place! Too bad it's so far (for me) and closes so early!"}
{"text":"So our friends said they had the best chicken fried steak and that's one of my favorite food so we had to check it out. Unfortunately I wasn't impressed with the CFSteak. It didn't taste any different from say Dennis or Ihop and the portion was too small. But I did love their biscuits and gravy but what really won us over is their cinnamon rolls. It's to die for So warm and not too sweet but just sweet enough. It taste like what your Grandma or mom would make. Just melts in your mouth.  Thinking about it right now is making my mouth water.  Wait staffs and people who works there are super friendly. If you go must try their cinnamon rolls and biscuits n' gravy.  We have not try other dishes but we will surely be back...maybe tonight writing this review is making me crave for some CINNAMON ROLLS!!!"}
{"text":"For what it is, this place is great. If you are looking for home-cooked food without having to do the cooking yourself, this is the place to go.

I went with a bunch of people that were from Indiana so that also made my experience very exciting but our server was friendly, attentive, and our order came out fast. I got the California omelette with toast and hash browns and I was a happy lady. I do wish there was just a LITTLE more avocado but it surely didn't ruin my meal by any means.

The large OJ was only $3 and my total was like, 12 something and change. WHAT A STEAL! So hearty too. If you want, you can get biscuits and gravy instead of toast but I tried to not overdue it. 

Go here, you won't be upset."}
{"text":"Okay so first and foremost I'm a midwest girl but don't normally eat to heavy but my goodness there's nothing like a midwest type cafe. The good is very simple and not  over worked which I love and enjoy. 

My partner and I both got the chili and cheese omelet. I got a pancake and he went with biscuits and gravy. We are both hashbrown people. The were so crispy and not frozen (there was not a frozen flavor). The chili was thick and full of beans and meat just the way I was raised. Eggs were cooked well and fluffy.

Coffee was good. Typical. 
Staff was great too! Welcoming. Friendly. 

It is wholesome people and food. Nothing over the top but that's why it's good."}
{"text":"I can't believe nobody has reviewed this wonderful little restaurant yet!  I've been going here for years, first with my parents, who are both from Indiana, then to treat my mother, my husband and kids, even my brother when he was in town.  Where else you gonna find a \"breaded pork tenderloin\" sandwich!  And it's really good!  They also have great breakfasts.  I had the \"Corn Meal Mush\" one day and expected a bowl of hot cereal, but it was actually strips of fried cornmeal batter which were delicious with syrup over them.  They came with a generous amount of bacon, too.  They are only open till 2pm so don't dawdle if you want to eat there.  And be sure to try the pork tenderloin!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place very much. I had the eggs biscuits and gravy and they were perfect. The waitress was very professional and friendly and she did check back one time after I received my food, I would have appreciated if she came back another time so I could have gotten more coffee  because they weren't overly busy at the time. I will go back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This place sometimes can get crowded but definitely worth the wait. Amazing home fries and omelets are amazing!"}
{"text":"Great chicken fried steak! They get the hash browns perfect! Great prices!"}
{"text":"You will love this greasy spoon as much as you love the diner look and feel to the place. Clean restaurant and it can get very busy at times, especially in the morning. This is a good place to come and read your paper and sip coffee. 

I had a standard breakfast with over-easy eggs, potatoes and toast. Now come on, I know what your thinking, who can mess up eggs and toast? Your right but they get it right, perfectly looking and tasting how a greasy spoon breakfast should taste. Which is good but obviously not that great for your health. Who said I was trying to save your life?

My partner's breakfast with the bacon looked awesome. The bacon looked thick cut and perfectly cooked to perfection. He has also had the bacon cheeseburger which he observes is equally satisfying."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've been coming here for years!!! Never a bad meal. Every time I come I ask for the \"J Monday\" it's 1/2 coffee, 1/2 hot chocolate with whip cream & chocolate drizzled on top! Delish!!!!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast with of course an Indiana Flair. This place is very nostalgic. There are jersy's and memorabilia of all teams Indiana as well as a menu with midwest dishes. The staff is very friendly and the place has many regular customers. It reminds me of Cheers!"}
{"text":"Went here for Easter Brunch, had a 10 min wait which was no big deal considering the occasion. The place was busy but the service was excellent! Place was clean. Our server made sure we had drink refills and our food came out within a short time. I had belgian waffles with eggs and crispy bacon, friends had pancakes and bacon burrito. All were delicious! Will go back here again!"}
{"text":"lol @ Gary in Chandler
I'm not a friend or family member of the owner ... and I love this place. I meet a friend here on a pretty regular basis when one or both of us is craving the biscuits and gravy. She often orders a steak & mushroom omelet. It's exactly what you'd expect from a greasy spoon in IN. I was born and raised in Lake/Porter Co in IN so my curiosity got the better of me when I found a breakfast place called Hoosier :) I'm glad it's as good as I hoped."}
{"text":"Pretty good food.  This restaurant is a true greasy spoon with a ton of Indiana sports memorabilia hanging around.  It hard to find healthier dishes on the menu so be prepared to charge up on some carbs.  The service was not terrible, but I have had much better service elsewhere."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Went for breakfast on a Sunday and were seated promptly, but then ignored for at least 12-15 minutes. Table was missing silverware, napkins, etc. Finally flagged down a waitress and asked for 2 glasses of water but never received them. Ordered coffee from a different waitress, but wasn't given mugs until our food order came out. Had to ask again for silverware and cream for our coffee even though two different waitresses had clearly observed our barren table on multiple passes. I feel like there was confusion as to whose table we belonged to. That's just bad, un-attentive service. I guess they're not interested in receiving a good tip. Food was average. Typical American breakfast. Decent prices and portions, though, which is only reason giving 3 stars. But they need to shore up their wait staff, because our experience was ridiculous."}
{"text":"Heard a lot about this place and was very disappointed.  We love eggs Benedict which 3 of us ordered.   One had a hair in it which they replaced....came out after everyone else was finished.   The hollandaise sauce tasted awful....I think it came from a can.   Not sure, but wouldn't recommend it at all.  The waffle was good but the pancake was rubbery!  Overpriced and slow service.  Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Excellent little breakfast joint! We went on a Thursday and it was packed. Never seen this place not full. Great food!"}
{"text":"I have been at least 20 times and I was never disappointed. Food was always good. There is usually a wait on weekends but during the week the wait time is very minimal."}
{"text":"You broke my heart today , I brought visitors bragging about the chile cheese omelette .
Betty told us it's off the menu ?
Oh my !
I'm so sad, one of my favorite things to eat ! 
Gone ."}
{"text":"I like biscuits and gravy every once in a while, so I decided to try Hoosier Café. It's an okay greasy spoon breakfast and lunch joint, heavy on the portions and on the grease. My eggs were cooked a perfect over easy, but the hash browns were too greasy to finish, and the sausages were thin, salty pucks. The biscuits were okay, but the gravy was gluey and bland. Still, the place was busy at 10:00 am on a weekday, so I think most people are getting what they want here. It is what it is -- an unapologetic greasy spoon diner that's not pretending to be anything it isn't. You're here for mass quantities, not subtle qualities."}
{"text":"My family really likes this place for breakfast and we came here while I was visiting for the holiday. Taking into consideration I eat out much more than they do, I am writing this review from my perspective as a passionate foodie. Overall I give Hoosiers 2 stars.

The main thing for me when I dine out is the food. I know a lot of people are into the ambiance and service is a factor in the equation. To me I could care less of the environment and will tolerate long line lines and rude employees if the food rocks. At Hoosiers, I found none of the above. 

I ordered Corned beef hash and eggs and my brother in law ordered Ham Steak and eggs. I usually choose eggs Benedict or corn beef hash as a means to judge a breakfast joint. I should have asked the waitress if they made their hash from scratch or from a can. When my food arrived, I quickly found out. The hash looked a lot like Alpo and tasted like what I would expect it to. Not much flavor and no texture or substance. It was mixed with a lot of home fried potato's, a trick a lot of restaurants use to make up for the tasteless flavor you would expect from something dumped from a can.

The eggs were cooked over easy and the potato's were cooked well and tasted pretty good. I think it's sad when the best aspect of a breakfast is the toast! My dining partner thought his food was good and the portions they give are fairly generous. The coffee was average and the refills were not given in a timely manner. 

Overall the service was just average. My family are regulars here and seemed to have a good rapport with the staff. Like I said earlier, refills on coffee were not that timely and no one came to followup once we got our food. When I went to pay the bill, the girl at the register had issues with the receipt printer running out of paper. She almost double charged me because she could print my receipt and told me \"I don't think the charge went through\" and asked for my ATM card again. I asked her to make sure before I haded it over. She got some assistance from the manager and I was right, the charge did go through the first time. While trying to straighten this out the line of diners waiting for tables got quite long. No one else offered to start seating customers even thought some guy who I assumed to be a manager (he was walking around while I was there, greeting customers like they do at Walmart, but not really helping anyone).

This place is located in a strip mall and has plenty of parking available. The inside has some Hoosiers paraphernalia, but seemed to be pretty average. Decent number of tables, but no outdoor seating. The cash register is located right next to the entrance, which creates a \"traffic jam\" for customers paying their bills and those who are waiting to be seated. There is no where inside for people to sit while waiting for a table. Customers have to leave their names and then go stand outside and wait to be called.

Chandler and Gilbert have several places for breakfast that rock all over this place. Taking this into consideration, I would not eat at this place again. The food was average at best (corned beef was awful) and the service left something to be desired. It was a holiday period, but I still expect decent service and this place was not that busy when I dined here. Don't waste you time and money with this place. I recommend the Farmhouse Restaurant and Liberty Market. To be honest, the breakfast I had at IHOP on Thanksgiving day was way better than this joint and they were packed and it was on a holiday!"}
{"text":"Such a good deal and a great spot for breakfast or brunch.  The portions are big and enjoyable but the food quality doesn't suffer from it. I always have leftovers and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"This is our favorite breakfast joint. It has a very Midwest feel with the menu and the people. Which is logical since it is called Hoosiers and is a shrine to Indiana and their sports. 

I like the Belgian waffles.  They are always great. They do it right."}
{"text":"The food was just ok have had better I've had worse, the wait staff is super friendly and nice though. My waitress was Veronica. The atmosphere is great though, I'm from the Midwest and I felt back at home."}
{"text":"A local breakfast and lunch diner that offers simple but delicious entrees. 

Hoosier is a colloquial term that most people who have roots in Indiana are familiar with.  Myself, well I have no idea. 

The pancakes are delicious, breakfast sandwiches are great as well, in the biscuits and gravy have great flavor. My only complaint is that the ranch potatoes are a bit soft, I wish they were a little bit more crispy, but that's just my personal preference.

Portions are quite large, tastes great and priced fairly. I choose Hoosier over Biscuits café any day of the week ! Although Biscuits café does offer Sweet potato pancakes that are just delish. 

The service at Hoosier is outstanding. Never once did I have to ask for our water refill or coffee refill, the waitress was very attentive and alert! She also helped me substitute side of meat for potatoes at no additional charge.

There's a strange shaped booth in Corner that fits 3 people sort of. If you could imagine a regular booth that fits around four people comfortably, this particular Booth is blocked off so only three can fit. It's just something that I found interesting.

Only reason why I didn't give a full 5 stars, what is due to the window exposure to the Sun during summer hours. Sitting next to the sun it was kind of hot and I was sweating. They see is okay here around a year, but during the summer hours it can get kind of hot. Again this is just me, for most people I might not affect them at all, but I wish that they had some type of sun shades or curtains to block out the bright rays of sun coming in through the windows.

If you're looking for breakfast in Palm court, stop on by !"}
{"text":"This place was horrible!  Thw waitress was very nice, however it took 40 minutes to get our soup and grilled cheese.  When we got the soup.....of course it was cold and it was not good at all!"}
{"text":"Growing up in Indiana, this place immediately caught my attention. Granted, Indiana isn't really a place that has its own food culture in comparison to areas like Chicago or Cincinnati, but I was still curious what kind of menu offerings they'd have.

Overall, I found the food to be good for a fairly traditional diner-level restaurant, which I feel is what they're going for.  The home-fries, scrambled eggs, and bacon were all done well.  I also added some corn mush to the mix, which I really liked.  It's a unique little menu offering that's sort of a cross between pancakes and cornbread, although don't fool yourself into thinking it's some Hoosier culinary trademark that is unique to the state.  When I sent my picture to several of my Indiana friends, they all collectively said: \"What the hell is that?\"

The decor is a tribute to all Indiana sports teams, both professional and college.  Although having Purdue and IU memorabilia side-by-side would probably induce heart attacks on customers if this place were actually located in Indiana.  

The restaurant consists of walls of windows, which can get offensively bright on sunny days.  But the prices are nice and the food was decent, so I can't really complain too much.  

Worth checking it out at least once for some corn mush."}
{"text":"Kinda busy and slow upon entry, but service was prompt and the noise level soon dropped as the \"old men's clubs\" gradually departed.  Okay, jk, but there were several groups of older men here today.

I noticed on the menu that the corn cake is a Midwest favorite.  I've never had it and ftm, I had never heard of it before either.  So after a few questions I decide to give it a try.  
I'll preface the rest and simply say I'm not gonna order it again.
It was, um, well it was just bland.  I couldn't figure out how to enhance it (butter, syrup, bacon, salt, catsup, etc.) so it had some appeal.
Yeah sure, maybe it's something you grew up with and you developed a taste for it but to me it was little more than being totally non-descript.  
So unless you're a fan, I recommend that you stick with the more traditional items on the menu.  
Biscuits and gravy -good
Waffles - good
Chicken fried steak - good
Hash browns - good
Coke products -works for me
Food has been consistent, served in less than ten minutes.

Service every time I have been here has been what I would call ideal.  
Friendly, prompt, attentive but without hovering.  

And kudos to the owner who came out to chat with me when I had a thousand questions.  He was kind enough to give me the low down on the Midwest favorite.
Maybe I should've asked him to add cornbread to the menu.
Well we will keep coming back cuz it's all really good stuff."}
{"text":"This place has some good diner food. I took my son here for breakfast and he had the kids French toast, egg, and bacon. It was a good amount of food for a kid, but my 6 year old eats like a horse and finished it all, plus quite a bit of my food. I had an egg white denver omelet with hash browns, and biscuits and gravy. The omelet was solid and the hash browns were  crispy. The biscuits and gravy were good, but my 6 year old swiped the for himself so I didn't get more than a bite. The staff works well together and drinks were constantly full. If you like good old fashioned fatty diner food, this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is very good and comes in substantial portion sizes. I usually get a breakfast burrito for 5-6 bucks and other additions are very affordable. They even have fresh fruit and I don't think anything on their menu is more than $8-10. 

They are quick, and very friendly.  Hoosier Cafe is just a nice place to get a good meal for cheap."}
{"text":"This place was HOPPING with business...having said that, we were told the wait would be about 15 minutes.  So, we stepped outside and before we could even light a cigarette; we were called in to be seated.  I'm a Hoosier and just had to check the place out.  I was not disappointed, good Mid West cooking, FRIENDLY waitstaff, hot food fast...delicious cup of coffee.  It's a little cramped in the dining area, but it was tolerable.  Good Food, Good Service, Good Prices...I'll be back"}
{"text":"This place was a nice clean little diner. The food was bland, but also not terrible. The price was average."}
{"text":"Ahh how this cafe once saved our lives ! My boyfriend and I were starving one morning and were awake at 5:30am on a Sunday morning, for some awful reason (not much of early risers). We saw this place was open at 6 and drove on over . We loved the omlettes and hashbrowns. It felt like a small town, delicious cafe. Tremendous and who doesn't like some sort of breakfast food, rather it be eggs, pancakes ,biscuits and gravy. The service was very nice and attentive. Clean restaurant. Would absolutely reccomend."}
{"text":"OMG the food was phenomenal!  Especially the cornmeal mush! Biscuits and gravy was awesome too!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. Probably since about..... '02? Before they changed owners at least 10 years ago. And ugh, it is just so flippin good. You can't go wrong with the biscuits and gravy. I honestly just get the two egg breakfast (no meat) with country potatoes add peppers and onions and with the biscuits and gravy, you don't need to eat again for the whole day!!! I've been to expensive fancy brunch places but literally nowhere can top Hoosier for freshness and price. Now I need biscuits and gravy!!!!"}
{"text":"My husband had sausage and eggs there yesterday and about 5-6 hours later was hit with horrible symptoms of food poisoning!  He had extreme diarrhea and projectile vomiting.  He is still very I'll, but improving now.  I tried to call them to tell them of the problem,  but could not be heard due to background noise.  I gave it one star because he said that it tasted good.  Be very careful."}
{"text":"The reviews don't lie!  

I have been there and the food is spot on perfect!  Every time I have been there, the food is always cooked fresh, eggs are a work of art!  The club sandwich is very tasty and the tea is real fresh brewed tea, not the powdered cheap tea!

Real Midwest style service and quality!

\"It's on like Donkey Kong\""}
{"text":"Our neighbor had a lot of great things to say about Hoosier Cafe and we decided to give it a try... 
They were super busy on Saturday morning, but the wait wasn't too bad. 
Waitress was friendly and kept the coffee coming which is extremely important to me!!! 
The food was good - they got the eggs right and the crispy hash brown was just perfect. 
Warning - the pancakes are huge! After eating the bacon and eggs, I could barely finish one!!!

The place could use a little updating, but for the price they serve pretty good breakfast."}
{"text":"Hoosier Cafe is not a heart healthy cafe.  Bring that knowledge through the door and you will be served up a hearty filling breakfast, albeit a fat-laden one.  I had the spinach omelet ($6.99) which came with hash browns or ranch potatoes, and toast or biscuits and gravy.  I chose the ranch potatoes and biscuits and gravy.  The omelet itself was great.  The eggs were fluffy, and there was a lot of spinach and mushrooms in the filling.  The spinach and mushrooms tasted great, but the spinach was loaded with grease/oil.  The biscuits and gravy were also very good.  The gravy wasn't overly salty, and the biscuits were soft and warm.  There was a large portion of potatoes to finish off too.  I could only finish about half of my meal.  Will definitely come here again to try more dishes!"}
{"text":"We come here for breakfast quite often. The prices are reasonable, the food is solid and it's normally super fast. We stopped in for a late breakfast yesterday and the food was fine, but for whatever reason the service was really slow. The food was still good, though."}
{"text":"On a rare Friday off, my boyfriend brought me to this place by his house for breakfast.  I was surprised at how busy it was for a weekday, but we were quickly seated and greeted with waters and menus. The boy got the spinach omelet and I had the corned beef hash plate. Things needed a bit of spicing up, but it was fresh, bountiful, and hit the spot. I'd definitely come back again for a fuss free breakfast."}
{"text":"Had the Belgian Waffle and Chicken Fried Steak Skillet. Awesome! Our waitress, Holly, was super nice. A great way to start the  Christmastime week."}
{"text":"We were unimpressed. The food was just ok, the coffee was not good at all. Service was just ok. Nothing special about this place. We have no plans to return."}
{"text":"Love this place! Always happy staff. Quick service and priced great. I have tried almost everything on the breakfast menu and I keep going back to the omelets."}
{"text":"This place has an amazing diner feel and it's delicious to boot. 
I had the 1/2 belg waffle + eggs and sausage. It was delicious and more than enough food for one person. Definitely coming back for breakfast."}
{"text":"This is such a nice breakfast spot in the east valley area. With the number of chains and new fancy breakfast spots open and opening around the Gilbert/Chandler area, sometimes you just want a simple yet delicious restaurant that's down to earth, Hoosier cafe is such place. 

I have been here a few times on the weekends and there is always a wait, typically 15-30 minutes but they tend to call you faster than the quoted time. The servers I have had have all been really nice and efficient, your cup will rarely be empty. 

I love their pancakes, seriously, I am not a big breakfast food person but these pancakes are so delicious and actually make me crave them. Bacon is also really good here, well bacon is good anywhere."}
{"text":"Prompt service, great iced coffee, the food I've tried has always been tasty. The portions are great as well. Some breakfast places skimp on the food, but not this place! Most times I have a hard time finishing my meal!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast this morning!! I ordered the meat lovers and it was amazing! Very filling and I think I found my new favorite breakfast place"}
{"text":"My husband and I like to try different places especially diner type places. I have to say that this place goes above and beyond. Big portions of pure good yummy for your tummy and the staff are so nice and attentive. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I am in town on a business trip and found this place on yelp. I have been here for breakfast the last three mornings. Just a good, old fashion eatery. Good service from friendly servers, good food, fair price, and a clean restaurant."}
{"text":"Holy bomb a$$ breakfast.... so we started out at First Watch and litterly sat down for 10 min with no one coming up to us and about 6 people just standing around so we left. The place was empty and now I know why. We have been wanting to try this cafe for sometime. We always eat at the Vietnamese resturant next door. Well here was out chance.. sat down right away... our waitress came up to us immediately and took drink orders then took out order. I have the 2 egg breakfast with bacon and biscuits and gravy. Yummmmmm .. the husband had chicken fried steak and eggs. The kids had Chocolate Chip pancakes and a French toast breakfast..the kids loved it ate everything. I think we found our new breakfast spot... loved that everyone was friendly and love the environment."}
{"text":"What a beautiful Dive Cafe !!! I ate there for the second time today and it is excactly what Arizona needs. There is no crappy corporate presence and it is not an over decorated establishment .  It is a simple cafe with hooser pennents everywhere. Biscuits and gravy are available as a side to my omelete. (No boring toast which I can have at home) This is a middle america restaurant that makes me feel as if  I am in a novel. I am waiting for a Patrick Swayze Replica to show up and challenge me to arm wrestle for not being local !!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick breakfast. I had the cinnamon roll and the corned beef hash, egg and hash browns. The cinnamon roll was excellent--gooey and warm. The corned beef hash and eggs were good too. I thought the hash browns were nice and crisp, but they had a weird under-taste. The service was super fast and very friendly! I'm glad I checked this place out!"}
{"text":"To make the Florentine Eggs Benedict perfect, do the following: 1. Add avocado slices 2. Replace the cooked spinach with fresh spinach. And for me I add two additional eggs because 
So good!"}
{"text":"This is a quality, run-of-the-mill breakfast joint.  The menu is not particularly diverse, but they have the typical staples for a good price.  

The service was very good and although we went on a Saturday around 11am, we were able to be seated rather quickly."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now, both times I got food to go, and everything has been really good. First time I got chicken fried steak skillet & second time I got the Denver omelette w/ hash brown & cheese and biscuit and gravy. The first time, the potatoes weren't quite as done as I like, but still good...second time the gravy had a bit to much pepper for me, but is still good. Like I said, these were just my preferences! Everyone was very nice on both visits and that goes for staff and customers. Overall, I plan on eating here again, cause the food is very good and you get a lot of it!!!"}
{"text":"Out doing my Saturday morning shopping and happened by Hoosier Cafe. I have driven by the spot many times but for some reason today I took notice of the crowd inside. So I suggested to my friend who I had just moments before expressed her need to eat soon that we finish our errands and come back to give this place a try. 

This was by far the best breakfast I have had in a good while. I know, I know it's hard to mess up bacon and eggs but many people do. This place is awesome. It has a small town, small cafe feel. The service was phenomenal and the food delish. I will definitely return. 

Oh, the food. I had the two eggs, ham steak, hash brown and biscuits with gravy. My friend opted for the chicken and waffles. I have one word...Yummylicious!

If you haven't been here you are missing out..."}
{"text":"Tried this joint out cause we were down at winco. Food came out quick, even with a packed house. I noticed that my sausage patties were microwaved and luke warm. Had a taste  and left them on the plate.  The eggs were ok and the french toast was the same. The biscuits were also microwaved and lacking taste. Overall it was ok, but the food was mediocre for such a full place."}
{"text":"It's your average breakfast/lunch place.. it has all ur basics from omelettes to burgers.. breakfast and lunch is served until they close which is about 2pm.. it gets busy but the staff are pretty on top of it. Our waitress was very attentive even though it was busy.. probably be back sometime in the future.."}
{"text":"Not bad at all, fairly quick service on a Sunday morning if you get in before the after church crowd. Food was fresh and good, prices were fair. Service was fast and friendly. 

I had the corned beef breakfast with ranch potatoes, yummy. My boo had a waffle and bacon, awesome."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I go here just about every weekend. Great breakfast every time! We have never had bad service or bad food. We've tried several different different breakfast items...all good. Everyone there is super friendly. Be prepared for a wait for a table at peak times on the weekends...and your food may be slow to come during busy times...but it is worth it!"}
{"text":"Yay diner!  Four stars for the diner category. Basic food, good prices, service with a little good natured lip backatcha.

Oh, and basic diner decor with an Indiana spin to everything.

Prices are good - in line with standard diner pricing.  I've had a variety of breakfasts here...if you consider omelets and scrambled eggs variety...always with bacon, potatoes and toast.  Solid.

Go Hoosiers!  What is a hoosier anyway?  As far as I know it is a kitchen cabinet with a small counter area attached.  Go kitchen furniture!"}
{"text":"Good morning my fellow Arizonian foodies.....

So by now you realize not only am I a PICKY person but I am proud to say I hail from Chicago and grew up eating at little breakfast dives.

When we moved here to Chandler I had hoped to find a good breakfast dive to start the day out right.

Our first day here we noticed Hoosiers and were so excited to give it a shot.

The first experience was ok.  The food wasent the greatest...by a long shot but the service was friendly and quick and the atmosphere was comfortable and reminded me of the midwest.

We tried again a couple weeks later and noticed, as we did on our first try, that the potatoes,bacon and biscuits/gravy, while good, were warm at best.

I am one who enjoys my food HOT (temperature wise), so by the time I am finishing up it is still a little warm.

The potatoes and bacon tasted as though they were made hours earlier and they forgot to heat them back up.

I tried a chili cheese omlette today and must say, I was happily surprised that it was quite Yum!  It had little green chilis that gave it a sweet taste with a nice bite.

I realize we live in Arizona where people think it is warm year round.....uhh uhh...not the case, it gets downright nippy in the winter and the restaurant is all windows and I froze all thru breakfast....guess theres not too much one could do about that, just bring a hat, gloves and a scarf and you should be ok :)
.
Anyway, not too much more to say about HOOSIERS.... its an ok place with ok prices and ok food

I would have given it 2 stars ( ehhh, I've had better) but I have yet to find a really good breakfast dive in the area and MATTS BIG BREAKFAST is just too far to go.....so, you get 3 stars out of default!

Go and give it a try...lets see what you think

and in the meantime.......

Bon Appetite' and stay warm"}
{"text":"All things Indiana. Boiler UP!

1. The biscuits and gravy were great. For any Purdue grads - can be mentioned in the same sentence and the Triple X Biscuits and Gravy.

2. Waffle with blue berries was great. Really good.. weird that I had to ask for the syrup though. Is syrup with a waffle not a normal thing?

3. The skillets... do not come out on a skillet. So.. its more of a HOT PLATE that pretends to be a skillet. This was decent.

4. Coffee... as you know I am a snob so.. 2 stars. Very Watery

Main take a ways it reminded me of college, so i got that homey feeling, and hte biscuits were great!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were visiting friends and looking for a breakfast spot. Our server Lisa was awesome! She joked with us the entire time and was an amazing server. Lisa recommended the corned beef (not from a can!) and chicken fried steak, both of which were delicious. Will definitely go back next time we're in town. Lisa also recommended a few tourist spots for us out-of-towners."}
{"text":"Sometimes the service isn't so great and the food is burnt now and then, but overall this is a great breakfast place.  Hoosier Cafe has been around forever and has enough cliental to not really need you to try them out. The food is delicious!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been coming in on Thursdays for about a month and have had  nothing but the best service from all of the staff. The food is in large portions and fantastic quality. Bring your appetite!"}
{"text":"My husband and I really enjoy coming here! He's been eating at Hoosiers since middle school, and it hasn't lost it's touch! t's very nostalgic for him. It's a great local breakfast and brunch and not pricey at all! The 2 Eggs options on their menu is a great \"bang for your buck\" option!"}
{"text":"Decent food, wait staff is friendly. I got the biscuits and gravy and they were good but nothing you can't find somewhere else."}
{"text":"This place was just amazing! We went for the first time today based on Yelp reviews. This place did not disappoint and we will definitely be back. Shannon was our server and she was very attentive to us. I believe the manager(didn't catch his name) also took the time to make conversation and check on the quality of the food and service. Both were superb. Let's not even get started on the portions. No matter what you order you should not leave hungry. Very very memorable first impression and the food was great."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. The prices are great, the biscuits and gravy were even better. The staff was prompt and there was hardly any wait on a Saturday morning for breakfast."}
{"text":"Ok, I have seen this business listed as a great place for breakfast.  I have passed by a couple of times and wasn't crazy about the outside appearance, too bland, and I kept driving.  However, I wanted to give this place a chance and see what it's all about.  I was impressed how clean and responsive the staff is.  There seems to be plenty of seating and I didn't see a bad seat in the place.  

The menu covered about everything one could ask for, except maybe the yogurt fruit craze some people yarn for.   I ordered the biscuit and gravy, and a waffle. Both were delivered promptly with normal serving size (not huge portions) and each was very good.  I would not hesitate to return and bring a friend!"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast recently - love me a good diner.  I had a half a Belgian waffle with ham and egg and sampled a little of my boyfriend's biscuits and gravy.  It was all great! Biscuit was light and fluffy and the sausage gravy was just right. The waffle was very good.  Portions are large, prices are cheap and the staff is very friendly.  Definitely will go again."}
{"text":"Just your average diner food; not good and not bad. Fries were a bit salty, but the Reuben was pretty good."}
{"text":"This place has a mom and pop feel. All of the food is homemade and delicious. Portion sizes are generous and for a reasonable price. The waitresses are very friendly and treat customers well. I come here for breakfast often!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the Midwest \"greasy spoon\" atmosphere!  I got an omelet and it delivered on all of my expectations, fluffy, cheesy, and stacked!  The toast was crispy on the outside and soft from the melted butter on the inside!

The service was great, they have good hospitality!

I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"I was on vacation and family took me there 2 times and the food was excellent. the waitress Candy knew the family sine they go in there all the time."}
{"text":"Best place for breakfast!! Love their omelets and biscuits and gravy!! Staff is friendly and service is speedy even on times when they are busy."}
{"text":"Service was fast and friendly. Coffee cup was never empty food was good and low priced"}
{"text":"This is my go to breakfast place, they know how to cook the eggs the way you want it and they have awesome french toast.

You have to try their french toast, service is great and it's not too packed unless its weekend mornings. Prices are reasonable but it could be a little cheaper. It's funny how so many places can't do proper breakfast food when it is the easiest to make."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for years and years. It's consistently good. My coffee cup is always kept full and the food is good."}
{"text":"This restaurant seems to be hit or miss .  Last visit they served home fries with undercooked green peppers & onions on top of them instead of actually cooking together with everything else.  No plans to go back."}
{"text":"This place on my way to work & always seem busy. Food was okay but the servers were very friendly & helpful. Price is bit higher than the quality but again, service was awesome."}
{"text":"\"Can we just call brunch what it is?  It's morning alcohol.  We're boozing in the morning.\" ? Chrissy Teigen

With a business name of \"Hoosier Cafe,\" we can already assume that this place loves Indiana.  While some may think of the Colts or Indiana University, I think of the TV show, The Middle.  \"Out here in The Middle...\" 

Anyways, back to stuff pertaining to this review.  We came here for brunch on Saturday and it was relatively enjoyable --- it would have been more enjoyable had there been an option for mimosas!  This place isn't glamorous but boy does it have a following.  We waited about 15 minutes for a table and there was a constant line the whole time we were eating.  The two of us ordered Florentine Benedict, a full order of Biscuits and Gravy, and French Toast with Eggs.  I know, I know... three entrees for two people? Our eyes were definitely bigger than our stomachs but we were full all day and ate broccoli with ranch for dinner to make up the calorie-intake!  So on my fork was one of the benedicts [I like to share], one of the biscuits with gravy [two biscuits in a full order], and majority of the potatoes that came with the egg benedicts.  

The verdict?  Delicious!  I was especially enamored by the perfectly seasoned gravy and the fluffiness of the potatoes.  My one complaint was that the spinach in my benedict looked a bit old [take a look at my pictures and you'll see an ugly dead leaf] and was a tad on the greasier side.  I suppose I could of used more hollandaise too but that's because I'm a fattie. 

All in all, I'm glad I saw Kate M. popping in here this week since her check-in spurred me to finally give this place a try.  It was a solid hearty breakfast and I wouldn't mind stopping in again."}
{"text":"Great breakfast at a fair price!  Just returned from a short business trip to Chandler and based on the praise of fellow Yelper's went a bit out of my way to give Hoosier's a shot.  It was well worth it.  

CB Hash and eggs over easy, Rye Toast, Home Style Potatoes (with onion and peppers 35 cents more) all prepared to perfection. The coffee was standard coffee shop variety, not bad and my cup was never empty :)  Sure beats the less than stellar hotel food or overpriced IHOP food I'm used to when travelling.  

The super friendly and attentive servers put the icing on the cake.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Pretty good food for the price, tons of potatoes with the country fried steak. Couldn't finish it."}
{"text":"Seems like a blast from the past... The servers are truly career waitresses making them honest and probably the best you'll ever find. The food was QUICK tasty and correct. . Getting food how you order it has some sort of perk, especially if your expected to pay for it. I would make the drive for another treat, though based on the wait and capacity on a Friday morning i would not dare a Saturday morning visit. . BUT, if your in the area, defiantly walk across the parking lot for a pedicure.. great little business complex they have over there. . A++"}
{"text":"Hoosier Cafe - I know you've got a ton of regulars and the line is out the door and up the block on the weekends so we stopped in on a Monday morning. Excellent service and friendly waitstaff. Loved our French Toast, no we really really loved our French Toast. The omelette breakfast was good too, but the plain old scrambled eggs were plain old scrambled eggs. My fault. A teeny bit of a problem with the bacon for our skillet breakfast, but what the heck? Everything else was good enough to make a return visit.See ya next time!"}
{"text":"Had the biscuits and gravy with two eggs and sausage patties.  I'm very particular about how my eggs are cooked and they did a good job the first time...so good there.

The other order was eggs, pancakes and bacon.  All were good and again the eggs were spot on.

Overall pretty darn good.  Not sure its a 5 but its at least a 4.5."}
{"text":"I can't believe I drove by this place almost every day for the last 12 years and never stopped! 
So I decided to stop in on a Saturday. Don't be discouraged when you see the line, it never seems that it the wait is very long and the food is worth the wait! Yum! Everything is good!  The staff is attentive and there is just a really nice vibe about this place!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast.  Reasonably priced.  Do this place...  I ordered the eggs and biscuit and gravy.  Gonna do it again this morning..."}
{"text":"We go here probably once a week, and any week I miss isn't going to be as good.  Fast, friendly, well cooked if simple breakfast foods that are consistently done correctly.  Coffee cup always full, easy to deal with and priced well."}
{"text":"Great hearty Midwest Breakfast in Chandler. Biscuits and Gravy is the real deal. Good Place to dine!"}
