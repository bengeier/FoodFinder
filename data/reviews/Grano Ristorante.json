{"text":"On our first night in Mississagua we discovered this \"True Jewel\" restaurant only steps from our vacation rental property.  It is a family owned place and we loved it.  From the wonderful woman who greeted us, the amazing chef (her husband) and the staff it was such a great experience.  It is small and intimate and a great place to relax and truly enjoy the dining experience.  Food was amazing and their house wine was wonderful.  We loved it so much we went back there on our last night.  Do give this restaurant a try.....you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We went here for our anniversary, and we were both very impressed with the overall experience. The ambiance of the restaurant was very cozy and relaxing, the staff was extremely helpful and friendly, and the food was extremely delicious. We had the brushetta as our appetiser, and for my main course, I enjoyed the excellent veal cutlet with the side of pasta. Highly recommend that dish. All in all, Grano Ristorante is an excellent restaurant that I will be looking forward to come back to again. There is also free parking available around the back, so no need to waste your money at the pay lots."}
{"text":"I took my girlfriend here a couple of months ago. We were both having a bad day and were in bad moods, but we were on top of the world after having dinner here! The atmosphere was intimate and quaint, and the service was personalized and very homely. The proprietress took our orders directly and you could see she took great pride in her food and her service. We enjoyed a delicious Italian dinner completed with tiramisu and even though it was a bit pricey, I had no reservation in tipping a little extra. We loved the experience and will be coming back on special occasions."}
{"text":"The food was great and the atmosphere was cozy and inviting. Small venue but didn't feel crowded. The price is fair. We went on a Saturday night and the food was ready fast. The food is fresh and authentic Italian. We had bruschetta to start The owner tended to us and he has five star service.  The only reason I gave 4 stars is that the blonde female  waitress who served us water at first also offered us bruschetta in a way that was insistent even when looked resistant to it. And when we hadn't finished looking over appetizers."}
{"text":"Intimate setting. Amazing service. Best veal and penne a la vodka I've ever eaten. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I really loved the place. It's authentic Italian. I am a vegetarian and they didn't have many options for me but the waitress was kind enough to get me a meal customized as per my needs. Great taste and amazing wines."}
{"text":"Lovely and welcoming. Bruscetta not the best. Calamari was excellent. Vitello was good. Dessert out of this world. Service okay. David a charmer. Going back very soon. A great find for those of us looking for a great meal in Mississauga."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located on Enfield Place, the street across from Kariya Japanese Park. It's hidden from street level so it might be hard to find.  The restaurant is small and dimly lit but very inviting. I thought service was a little slow but that didn't phase me because their pasta was soo delicious. Great for a date, a special occasion, or if you just happen to crave Italian food."}
{"text":"I WAS a regular customer at Grano's and am super disappointed that I will never return there again.  I am rating this review a 2/5 because the food is so delicious here and I could never say anything bad about how hot and fresh and tasty each dish I've tried is. And I have had most of the menu items, as well as many of the daily specials.  The prices I think are also reasonable.  Let me get on to why I will NEVER return.   I was here for my sister's birthday dinner.  The service was adequate throughout the night which is as expected as I wouldn't say they are known for their service.  At the end of the night, we paid the bill and were ready to leave when the owner/manager called us over.  She claimed that we did not tip enough (note that there was no specified tip amount added to the bill, therefore tipping for service is at the customer's discretion).  She claimed we tipped only a nominal amount.  All the customers in the restaurant were staring at us.  We recounted the bill with her and she realized that she had COUNTED WRONG.  THEN, she had the nerve to say that usually the tip should be 20%.  Well excuse me, but when did a tip become a specified percentage.  Should a tip not be based on service received?  Is it not at the discretion of the customer?  We believed that a tip of 15% on the AFTER TAX amount was adequate for the adequate service we received.   If it was expected of us, then perhaps they should have put it into their bill so there would be no argument. We were so horrified and disgusted that one of my party ended up throwing in an extra $20 to save argument and we left. Unfortunately, we won't be returning again. If I had not had so much wine at dinner, I probably would have lost it on her, and refused to tip extra since I don't think it is the law to leave 20% tip.  Grano's - you get tipped what you deserve. If you don't like that, then put it into the price to save yourself the trouble of telling customers that you DESERVE to get 20% tip.  After coming here regularly for 2 years, I will not be returning. I have referred MANY customers to this restaurant and now none of us will ever come back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just came back from dinner after finally making a trip into this hidden gem.  We live in the area and always walk by and promised ourselves we'd make our way in at one point or another.  We are huge on trying out new restaurants for great food and great service.  We often dine out at 5 star restaurants and Grano Ristorante is now in our top 5.  It is a cozy, dimly lit restaurant with welcoming and attentive staff.  Our servers were well-knowledged in not only their menu, but in Italian cuisine overall.  They were a delight!   My boyfriend ordered the gnocchi which could only be described as out of this world!  It had this perfect light texture and feel as the ricotta gnocchi just melted in your mouth.  The chicken marsala was a light blend of savoury and sweet, perfect to the last bite.  The food is served hot and fresh which makes a great deal of a difference when dining out.  I can't wait for my next stop inside, or for an order to go.  They will certainly be seeing us again and again.  Thank you for a great night out, Grano Ristorante!"}
{"text":"Didn't get to even eat nor try to make a reservation because the racist host talked down to me like I wasn't worthy to walk in.  Next time be nice, it'd be great to be coloured and order pasta."}
{"text":"Had a business dinner there, close to the Novotel where we are staying. Very intimate place owned by an Italian couple who has been in the restaurant business for. 20 years. Super fresh food and definitely can taste the 'homemade' touch. The menu is fairly small but enough options to please everyone. A few outstanding dishes: trout, pappardelle salciccia, spagettini rapini. Desserts are made by the wife. Highlight is the 'fantasy' dessert with their own peaches."}
{"text":"Nice little place. Great food and Tiramisu was perfect. I recommend checking it out. The ravioli was really good as well."}
{"text":"They are greedy. Booked for Valentine's day, was told that there was 2 hours sitting limit - fine. When I got there with two other people they had a set menu for $50 a person that didn't include, tax, tip, or a drink.The fixed menu had no vegetarian options and the only thing they could offer was a variation of the main dish without meat but at the same ridiculous price. They did not say anything about fixed menu and no vegetarian options when I was making the reservation - we didn't stay and I will think twice before coming back again - I enjoyed the food before but this kind of bad faith makes me not want to come back."}
{"text":"Seriously impressed with this little hidden gem tucked in a small residential building. As a local, I had never seen this place but was eager to try due to positive reviews.  It is a quaint, intimate restaurant with a very nice atmosphere - perfect for a romantic date or for a nice private dinner. Service was very attentive. Food seemed quite authentic and a lot of the menu choices were described as 'homemade'. Garlic bread is complimentary, and there was seriously so good and fluffy that we got another basket.  I ordered an insalata appetizer with bocconcini cheese and tomato slices drizzled in olive oil. It was a delicious and refreshing start. I ordered one of their special pastas for the day, which was a penne with sausage and mushrooms in a tomato-based sauce. Portion and prices were quite reasonable. Ended the meal with a homemade tiramisu as recommended by our waiter, which was so intensely creamy and light, I would eat it over and over again.  All-in-all, a very good choice of Italian food in Mississauga for an intimate affair. Would come back again!  Tip: There is EXTREMELY limited parking up front, so it's best to park underground which is around the back end of the plaza. Should be free if you go for a meal."}
{"text":"Cute little place tucked away in a corner. Small place with warm decor. Food is excellent and even the house wine is not some cheap stuff but decent good tasting wine. Bread in the house is perfect. I had the Penne Con Sausage and the tiramisu for desert. The penne was perfect and well cooked and tasted really good. Will recommend and come back. For weekends do remember to make a booking."}
{"text":"If i could have more than 5 stars i would!!   This was the best italian restaurant outside of Italy.  Its small and quaint and the food was absolutely amazing.  I had the veal picasso. My husband had veal marsala that wasnt on the menu but they were very accomodating when he asked if they could make it.  Even as full as we all were  our party of 5 each had different desserts.  I thought that the dinners were amazing but WOW the desserts were to die for!!!  The fantasy was almost too pretty to eat.  The cheesecake was the lightest best i ever had.  I really could go on and on.   You just have to come here!!!"}
{"text":"Good authentic Italian pastas with a hint of localization (in a good way)...  Cozy place hidden in a side alley of a residential building...  Family run with good service...  Definitely the best hidden gem in Mississauga.  Only drawbacks are its short opening hours and the fact that you can't book online via open-table..."}
{"text":"I probably won't be back here... chose to make a reservation  for vday here instead of any chain restaurants due to my last experience here plus the food options.   Made the reservation by phone after checking their website. Got a spot for 630 pm after being told they are squeezing us in because they are really busy for vday. Great thanks!  Arrive day of and restaurant is empty save a few tables. We are sat down and the first gentleman who greeted me was nice and made a few jokes.    A blonde server comes over, she never introduced herself so don't know her name. She asks us what wine we would like...no menu. I ask her for a wine menu. She comes back with one, after looking at the wine list and not finding any offered by glass except their house I got a glass of white. She's like no bottle? .........  A quick look at the menu told me a disappointing fact... this restaurant chose to do a vday menu with just a few over priced offerings... not advertised on the phone or website... ravioli was their veggie choice   I asked our server if I could order just a plain pasta with vegetables because cheese wasn't an option. She actually scoffed and said ask him, gesturing to the guy who greeted us and then walked away.   If my wine had not already arrived by that point I would have got up and left. As we patiently for him to finish with another table the owner came over and said she can do a vegetables and tomato sauce pasta. I said thank you, she said we don't have a choice. **stab  Bf ordered a $23 lasagna... by this time he wasn't even in the mood for any apps... just dine and go.   His lasagna was the the size of a hockey puck and he said it wasn't up to par.   My pasta was delicious and a great portion $19.   The server came by again and made it obvious we were wasting her time by not getting a dessert...   While we were the size ore a couple came in to the still half empty restaurant and was turned away because they were fully booked, when they asked if they can do take out they said no we are really busy ?!?!?  $70 for a mediocre meal.... should have cooked and grabbed a $30 bottle of wine myself   Normally the atmosphere makes it... this one fell rly short."}
{"text":"Came here today to grab dinner with my partner. I've heard a lot of good things so I was really excited but sadly, it did not live up to expectations.  Food: (Gnocchi 4/5) I ordered the gnocchi with a tomato cream sauce which was pretty good! The texture was soft and chewy and I could actually see that it was stuffed with ricotta cheese! They were also generous with the sauce!  My partner on the other had a terrible meal (carbonara 1/5)!! The pasta was he cheap kind you get out of a box and they didn't strain it properly so the sauce tastes like water and didn't stick to the noodles at all. It was also a very small portion with the smallest amount of soggy bacon.  Service 4/5: The waitress was pretty nice. A bit slow but we weren't rushing so it wasn't a big deal. I ordered the gnocchi which apparently takes a while because it's made to order (does that mean the other pasta isn't?!) but she warned us which I appreciated.  You also get a complementary basket of garlic bread which was pretty good!  Atmosphere (3/5): Very small place, quaint but homey. I doubt they could seat more than 30 people."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Great ambiance. Service sub par. Took my GF there for her birthday dinner.  A. Service: Was expecting a lot better service than what we received.  It was constantly slow,  the table next to us would get served, and the servers would not look at us or approach us to take our order till we flagged someone down. This is a very small place,  yes it was packed,  but coming to our table every once in a while was not too much to ask for. We did towards the end get a very friendly server, but unfortunately the damage was done.   B. Food: Excellent food overall. 4.5/5. 1. Grilled calamari starter - Decently prepared. But not wow. This is why it loses .5 star in the food category.  2. Lamb special. Ordered by the GF. She loved it.  Medium. Grilled to perfection. Just the right amount of juicieness. I wanted to steal the entire plate from her.  3. Chicken special of the day.  I can't for the life of me remember the name.  Again excellently prepared. The chicken,  the mushrooms,  the cheese on top, all spent just the correct amount of time in the oven.  4. Tiramisu. One of the best I've tried in any restaurant,  be it in Canada, USA or even Italy. The girl couldn't stop raving about it.  5. Marble cheesecake: light, fluffy, creamy. Just right. Not your typical cheesecake. This place is worth going to just for their desserts.  6. The wine pairing was nice. We got Cesari company's  Mara I  believe. Went well with the meal.   C. Ambiance : A great date location for mississauga. It's like you are in a small town in Italy almost.   Overall, they may be having an off night, and I will give them another chance because of the superb food and nice ambiance."}
{"text":"This place is certainly a gem in a secret corner of the city. It is hidden among these tall condo and business buildings. There is no parking spot for the restaurant or in the plaza. The nearest parking option is in the visitor parking across the street in an office building. It is free for one-hour parking, and $5 for over the time limit.   My boss is an Italian Canadian, he recommended me here at first. I have to say the food here is very authentic and the price compared to the ones in downtown Toronto is much reasonable. The servers are very experienced and easy for them to remember the menu and the ingredients for each dish. The wine selection is not huge but is decent enough for a wine-lover in an Italian restaurant.   It is hard for me to decide which dish is my favourite, but I am not a fan of the seafood here. It's not because the fish or the clams are not fresh, but I believe the chicken and the other options will be better off for the price you pay.  The biggest thing I must highlight is the cheesecake here. As a guy, I am not a fan of dessert after the meal. However, I am addicted to the dessert here and order the cheesecake every time no matter how full I am. If you are a fan of cheesecakes, I highly recommend the one here. If you don't like Italian food, you can order the take-out. They don't have unlimited supplies for the cheesecake, so you'd better act fast!"}
{"text":"Decided to go here after being exhausted from all the franchise options around square one area. This place blew my mind and taste buds obviously in an amazing way. Food was impeccable.  Wine list was impressive. I had the carbonara which was the real deal! No cream. Veal chop was seasoned perfectly cooked perfectly.  It came with goat cheese which I thought was unnecessary because the veal spoke for it self. Boyfriend had the veal with frangelico cream sauce which was perfectly executed . Pasta was done al dente. Dessert! Omg dessert was heavenly. Tiramisu was light and beautiful. Chocolate creme brulee was perfect. Not overly chocolate-y or sweet. Smooth and decadent. I will be back soon. Service was excellent.  Didn't hover. All in all amazing experience. I only took a star off cuz they forgot to put my mussels order in."}
{"text":"Had the chance to try Grano a few weeks ago. Had bruschetta for appetizer which was good - great bread. Had the lamb chops which was the special that night and they were so tender and well done. Pasta too was fresh and delicious. Dessert was amazing - had the cheesecake with raspberries and it was one of the best desserts I've had in a while!  The bonus was this is an intimate family run restaurant which is evident in the service and quality of food. Looking forward to going back to try more of their menu!"}
{"text":"This place is truly a hidden gem.  It's so hidden, I had to call to ask where exactly they were located lol.  On Google street view, they aren't exactly visible.  They are right behind the &co restaurant with a burgundy canopy.  Unfortunately there wasn't any visitor parking for us in the underground lot so we had to pay $5 for parking in the public lot.  There was also a lack of street parking.  We arrived on a Saturday night and there was just one large party there.  The place is very small, so I'm glad it wasn't packed and we were seated right away.  The hostess read the specials out for us and my friends both ended up getting a special.  I had my heart set on the veal parm, so that's what I got.  My friends got the chicken parm on special and a salmon linguine in cream sauce.  We decided to get the bruschetta to start/share. I thought this was pretty tasty.  My one friend had hoped for the bread to be a little firmer, as the middle of the bread with the tomato on it, got a bit soggy.  I didn't mind this as I don't like my bread to be too crunchy.  They also give you a basket of complimentary garlic bread..which is exactly the bruschetta bread minus the tomatoes and cheese lol.  So yes, it was good lol.  My veal was HUGE (see pic!). It was basically the size of my plate with some penne on the side.  The penne seemed very little in comparison to the size of the veal.  This didn't bother me much as I still had plenty of both to eat the next day. Their tomato sauce is excellent.  It's not too salty or acidic.  Just right.  My friend's chicken parm wasn't as big as mine, but still large in portion.  He devoured it and loved every bit of it.  The salmon linguine was great as well.  I tried a bit of it and the cream sauce was just right.  Not too heavy.  My friend also devoured her meal.  We all shared a piece of tiramisu which was $9.  I've had better but this wasn't the worst.  Still very light with lots of flavour.  However, at $9 I wouldn't say it was worth it.  Overall, I'm glad I finally got to come here.  The service was great and they were very friendly.  Our waters were constantly being filled.  I will definitely return!  TIP: Ask for separate bills ahead of time or they will just bring you one bill without asking."}
{"text":"After travelling to Italy this past summer, we have been sorely disappointed with much of the Italian food options here in Mississauga. When we heard about the rave reviews surrounding Grano, we were hopeful... And we were not let down!   We started off with a bruschetta and it was simple and delicious. The basket of garlic bread was also super tasty. For our mains, I chose the spaghettini rapini, and the rest of my family chose the penne alla vodka, spaghetti carbonara and the filetto di manzo. Every single dish was yummy and most importantly, authentic! Well cooked, seasoned, and portioned. We also ordered dessert--the tiramisu is a standout.   What made this restaurant extra special was their impeccable service. So sweet and friendly and extremely helpful. Anyways, let these pictures do the talking! Don't miss out on this amazing Mississauga gem!"}
{"text":"#YELPGTA #GRANO #RISTORANTE  Home style. Intimate. Romantic. Upscale.   Grano, ironically located right beside Tilted Kilt in Mississauga, is probably one of the smallest fine-dining restaurants I've been to. I doubt this restaurant seats more than 30 people. And the smallness is what makes the restaurant so cozy and intimate; it's got a bit of a Kalendar vibe. The restaurant is perfect for small family dinners and dates.   The service is top-notch. It's nice having older servers - I find them friendlier and more patient. Ours made sure that our glasses were full at all times, and explained everything in the special menu animatedly, repeating when needed. She did the \"excellent choice ... this is perfect if you like...\" after each order.   We started off with the complimentary garlic bread.   I ordered off of the special menu - it was Tortellini doused in pesto. Love.   My mom ordered the Penne Arrabiate with added shrimps. This was a little too spicy. They might have done the whole \"brown people - add more spice\" deal.   And my dad got the Vitello Limone, a veal dish. Fantastic, and probably the best one out of the three.   The portions aren't huge, but filling. And I for one, can't wait to go back for more."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time last week and was amazed! A very cute Italian spot near square one. Food was awesome and service was amazing. Good size portions and fresh ingredients I will definitely go back ! Also a good spot for a date night in Mississauga."}
{"text":"The place is a lot smaller than I expected but it had a cozy feel. Their complimentary garlic bread was great. The bruschetta I ordered was good too. For the main course I ordered the gnocchi. It was a little bland but adding some pepper helped. All in all it's not the best place for Italian food but it's a solid choice"}
{"text":"Food was ok, nothing too special but portions are good for a fair price and not overpriced.  I would have given it a higher rating if the service was better. It took quite awhile for our food to come out (and it was only two pasta dishes). When we were done, we asked if they had a dessert menu and it seemed the waitress was eager to have us out as it was just past 9 and they close at 10, despite the long wait for our main dish. She listed off 3 dessert choices and when I asked about coffee, she said they only had Americano (even though I saw a cappuccino machine). We decided to go elsewhere for dessert."}
{"text":"Very nice family restaurant . Good food and good service. I recommend to checking it out. Loved home made dessert done by Filomena ."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with friends on a Saturday night around 8:00 and had no problem getting a table, but the restaurant is small only about 16 tables that quickly filled up so I think a reso maybe needed if you're not lucky. The restaurant was full when we left at 10:30.  Park in the underground visitor's parking for free. Entrance is a little hard to find... Enter from the east side of the building. It looks like you are entering an alleyway but you will see and open door to a garage at the end on the right. Take the door up the stair and walk outside, the restaurant is next to the door exit to the right.  Warm candlelit Italian style decor, small space maybe 15-18 tables but few are in nooks of the restaurant which feel private and comfortable, very intimate feel. Nice spot for dates and/or relaxed dinner with friends.  Ordered: -Grilled calamari: great, well seasoned and cooked, nice presentation and texture. Came with bed of green that was well seasoned. Would get again. -Spaghetti carbonara: good flavour, but weird with spaghetti and a little oily for my tastes. -Tiramisu: great light dessert... fresh cream  Overall good experience. Great pleasant service and good food, good ambience. Prices ok.  Would return."}
{"text":"Grano delivered on exceptional quality of food and dining experience. It was my first time here and certainly won't be the last! Portions are large and filling. Complimentary garlic bread is brought to the table and replenished upon request. Bruchetta invites indulgence due to its gooey goodness. Salads are abundant and shareable. The evening special; Fettuccine Gamberi (one of four) was phenomenal! The dish contained tiger prawns, smoked salmon and sweet peas mixed in a white sauce. Make reservations because the restaurant is small. Elegant interior. Great for a celebratory dinner or date night."}
{"text":"This place literally Took me to italy. Great quite small joint but wait till you taste their fresh fooood. From bread to pasta to desserts uncomparable"}
{"text":"This is an awesome little Italian restaurant near Square One amidst all the chain restaurants. At first we were rejected for not having a reservation, but I called in 15 minutes later to make a reservation, and they had space luckily so we got a table for 2. The complimentary garlic bread was nicely done. To start we got the calamari, which was good, but I probably wouldn't order it again. It wasn't as soft as I would like and being grilled, the squid taste was too much. I got the spaghetti carbonara, which was tasty if a bit too oily for my liking. I much preferred the the spaghetti al pesto that my fiancee got. It was absolutely delicious and a 5/5 dish. The portions were fair and so were the prices. Lastly, the service was frequently by our table to refill our drinks."}
{"text":"Italian food at its finest. If you are looking for  authentic Italian food at a very good price then this is the place to go . The food is  served fresh with generous portions. Had dined here and loved the food.  The tiramisu is very good and you must get it if it is available ."}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?!  I think out of the pastas we've tried, the spaghettini with white creamy pesto sauce was the best. Very creamy and delicious. So I would recommend any pasta with their creamy sauce. But if you're not a white creamy sauce person, the next choice would be anything with the tomato sauce.   The pasta dishes were affordable and generally alright, but I wouldn't say it was the best Italian pasta I've had. I also ordered linguine in aioli with rapini and sausage. The rapini was definitely overcooked and didn't taste like effort was put in to make the rapini because it was that overcooked to borderline mushy.   I don't usually like giving bad ratings but other than the food, service was very poor. There was only one server for the whole dining area (which is not a big place) and I think he was the owner to the place. He didn't serve me water when I asked for it and his attitude towards giving us service was very poor. It's almost like he was expecting me to order wine or else I'll have to wait for the water when he remembers or when he feels like it. My friends and I got the impression that he was annoyed at us and he wanted to leave on time at 9 pm when his restaurant were to close because he emphasized the restaurant would be closing at 9 pm at 8 pm while we were enjoying our dinner. I felt really bad because my friends felt very uncomfortable eating at his restaurant and felt rushed. I understand ppl may have bad days, but if you work in the service industry, it's expected that patrons wish to be served with kindness and care if patrons did not do anything wrong. Restaurants thrive on having loyal customers coming back and good word of mouth. It's unfortunate that his service was very rude and uncalled for. I would not be recommending such a restaurant and his service to my fellow friends and readers.   LAST TIP?!  If you have a big party, this restaurant may not be able to accommodate your size. You'll have to call in advance. They emphasize they are a family restaurant and can only serve so many people at one time. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant if you want to have a great time if you are served by this server."}
{"text":"The ambiance was cool I understand the whole dim lighting and tight spot. The service was okay and food came out pretty quick but I don't think it had much flavour. It tasted pretty bland to me but wasn't bad that I couldn't eat it. Maybe next time I would try something else off of the menu instead."}
{"text":"We went for a birthday celebration and discovered it as a hidden gem in Mississauga. The restaurant is family run and definitely small, but perfect for small groups and intimate dinners. There's a separate small room that could probably accommodate a small party. The ambiance was definitely more fine dining and romantic due to the dim lights, soft music and candles. There doesn't seem to be much staff working, one waitress, one person at the counter and at most two people in the kitchen. The staff were all incredibly nice and took time to introduce us to the daily specials and the ingredients that were in them so it accommodates my vegetarian friends.  They give you a basket of garlic bread (who can say no to that??) and let you enjoy that as you wait for your food. We all ordered pasta and it was really good. Flavourful, but not in an overly salty way. We originally thought the portion sizes were small but as we worked through our meal it became clear that we would be stuffed/ would need to take some home.   *make sure you inform them that you want to split the bill prior to them processing it. We were told they couldn't split the bill afterwards since they didn't have a computer (honestly, not sure how that's relevant since... they had a calculator). Nonetheless, we calculated each of our portions using our phones and just showed the waitress the amount due for her to input into the card machine."}
{"text":"This was a really good, hole in the wall (or alleyway) restaurant in Missisauga.  All the sauces were made from scratch.  Gnocchi was very good.  And service was very good. Recommended!"}
