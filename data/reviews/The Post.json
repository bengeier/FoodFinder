{"text":"We enjoyed breakfast at the Post.  While the buffet looked good we just weren't that hungry to justify the $15/plate we ordered and split their breakfast burrito.  It was large, delicious, filled us up.   The service was stellar and overall it was a very pleasant meal."}
{"text":"Linda was my bartender. She as great to start off with. I ordered a filet mignon and it was supposed to come With a citrus butter but instead it came with a demi glaze that when I told Linda about she didn't care at all Really. She asked me if I wanted her to go check for some citrus butter, no I don't. I don't want the butter with the demi but whatever. I told Linda twice that the men's bathroom was out of paper towels and nothing was done. Finally I went to the front desk and they knew nothing about the paper towel situation and I didn't want to bring them in to the steak problem. Basically, if you want a steak here, don't go. If you want wings here, don't go. You want a beer here? You're safe. I would avoid Linda if you have any concerns absolutely any menu or housekeeping concerns."}
{"text":"Clean and friendly atmosphere. Server was attentive and welcoming.  Not much to choose from but keep in mind it's in a hotel.  I ordered chicken quesadilla which was very tasty. The chicken was grilled and was throughout the tortilla. Veggies were also grilled. This was very satisfying. There was not a long wait after ordering which was very nice. My view was the very clean pool right outside the window.  Good food and service clean and cozy restaurant."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and waiters and the breakfast was very delicious and fulfilling.  Also has option of buffet as well."}
{"text":"While the lady at the front kiosk was very nice, the actual effort to make the customer happy here is just as lousy as at the main check-in, where they just don't seem happy or friendly. Case in point, a menu item (quesadilla) with two meats in it and no substitutions or discounts to get it without any of the meat... Seems like a total ripoff. Sad! And the company I work for gets rooms here like nightly, hope I never get sent back...never been a good experience at this Crowne! :("}
{"text":"This place was awful and a horrid waste of my money. I wish that I'd called a cab, paid them to take me anywhere else, and paid whatever the cost was when I got there for any other food. I shouldn't have been lazy. I shouldn't have thought \"Hey, I'll just drop into the hotel restaurant for a quick bite before turning it for the night. That will be fine.\" I was wrong to think that. My wallet and my taste buds still have not forgiven me.   I went simple. What's something that's hard to mess up? I ordered a burger. It actually sounded pretty good too. Some kind of house-made Jack Daniel's barbecue sauce on a burger, topped with onion rings and cheese. Side of fries. I've been down this road. What could go wrong? Everything. It was awful. Please use the image I've posted as a reference. The burger was way overcooked. The cheese was not even melted. It was like they put cold singles on top of an already cooled down burger and they just sat there, perfectly geometric. The \"onion rings\" amounted to a single \"I totally came out of a frozen bag\" pathetic onion ring that didn't even look appetizing or add anything to the burger because of how unsubstantial it was. The house-made Jack-Daniel's barbecue sauce that was championed on the menu as the flagship of this masterpiece? Almost non-existent! Where is the barbecue sauce?! There was a dusting at best on top of the aformentioned abysmal onion ring! It was as if the onion ring accidentally came into contact with a dab of some barbecue sauce and the frantic cook wiped as much off as they could before sending this monstrosity out into the world.   And the fries were disgusting. I didn't even finish the first one I tasted. Soggy. Revived frozen food that was bad even before it was frozen. Awful.  This was one of the worst meals I have ever had the unfortunate luck of paying for. Don't go here. Go anywhere else. McDonald's could be a James Beard Award winner, comparatively."}
