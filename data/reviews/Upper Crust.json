{"text":"This place is almost as good as the guy that takes your order. Have a few drinks. Go in here. Eat the pickles. Eat the pizza. Eat the chickens. Eat the fries. Take the leftovers home and wonder why all pizza places can't get on this level."}
{"text":"I was working in the area and needed a good lunch. 

The front staff were friendly, the rear not so much but I think there is a language barrier. 

I ordered a plate with Salmon, veggies, and a Greek salad. 

It was delicious and the large plate was covered in food. 

Best healthy $10 meal I have had in years.

I will be back next time I'm in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I was just moving into the neighbourhood that morning and needed to get a quick sandwich and coffee before the movers came, so I ran into this place even if the name irritated me and was soooo disappointed. The woman from the back kept barking orders for the girl at the front who was obviously new. My bagel with cream cheese and tomato and cucumber was terrible. The tomato was tasteless and had a very filmy consistency so I took it off my bagel completely. The cream cheese was very loose and the wrong consistency. I didn't even finish the whole thing. Who can screw up a bagel and veg? The coffee for a drip cup was nothing to complain about at least.

The meal was way too overpriced and my seat didn't even have a cushion which meant I was about to sit down on metal planks. They should either get rid of it or put another cushion on. I have a feeling no one really inspects the interior, or the display. The cakes were in cardboard boxes that looked like they were from Costco. I don't understand how people sit there to eat when Leslieville is booming with better cafes. Maybe they're making the mistake I made."}
{"text":"Just ordered the meat ball sandwich.  It is smaller than it was but it has definitely gone up in price from 2 months ago when it was $6.75 it is now $7.91 and looks like a small hamburger.  Last time I go there."}
{"text":"Amazing pepperoni pizza and veggie and me pizza!  We also got chicken tenders and the seasoning was superb. Serving of tenders and fries was very generous. The delivery guy was extremely nice and friendly."}
{"text":"The pizza was really good.  I had extra cheese and mushrooms.  The only thing I did not like they were unable to get  wings due to the fryer was not working.  I would go back again."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Friendly, helpful, and informative staff. I love this place and will definitely be a regular!"}
{"text":"Exactly what I was looking for. Huge portions and hearty good comfort food. I split the pasta bake and also had jojos and cheese pizza. All were really good. Nice savory tomato sauce that isn't sweet. Delivery was faster than the time quoted and the driver was very friendly. Leftovers were just as good the next day."}
{"text":"Excellent crust. Extremely messy to eat and on the greasy side. All topping are extremely thick and either hard to bite through or fall off. I would recommend if you're just getting cheese, though. I had the veggie."}
{"text":"This place has online ordering which is great I ordered online and had to call to make a change to my order the description of their items could be a little bit better I'm not a fan of sweet potato fries so after realizing what Southwest fries are I called to change them for the Joe Joe's they didn't start off on the right foot my pizza arrived 15 minutes late but that shadow the fact that the pizza was great it was not too greasy and Had fresh ingredients the cheese and sauce was adequate other than needing to work on their delivery time this place is spot on"}
{"text":"Ordered this for delivery today. Got the triple double pie. The pizza was great. A bit messy so for sure have a plate. However I dont consider that a downfall by any means. I got the pan style crust. Im more of a thin NY style guy but a friend was ordering. Still enjoyed it and it filled me up after two slices. They are very generous with the toppings. As far as lakewood goes, id get a pie here before anywhere else in lakewood. I will try the thin crust next time. Wasn't as greasy as all the other reviews say in my opinion."}
{"text":"While I sat to people-watch, more like Devan R-watch as he blazed off to the WAYLA Elite Event late as usual, I sipped my La CourTisane Tea(Teabag) from a Mug and cut into the light & airy Lemon Mousse Cake($4.00+).  The friendly front-of-house staff suggested the Rocky Road Square but I asked for something less rich dense for my first meal of the evening.

I didn't see any posting of hours on the door but as you know, if I see light inside I will walk in.  I found out they closed 8:00 pm on Tuesday nights but not sure about other days.  I too did hear the back-of-house staff instruct the staff at the front as Magdalena noticed.  2.5 *Star*

As I walked out and said goodbye to the friendly front-staff, I saw an unwelcoming expression from the secondary staff's face.  Rough-day-at-work look, the same I had and needed a Tea to keep me going for the party ahead.  Maybe if they had some music in this place to lighten everyone's mood, it would feel like a welcome staycation rather than grab-n-go.

As Isabella L commented, some Cakes/Sweets could possibly have a dry taste as I notice at the end-of-night they put the plastic dome over the Cakes.  Standard practice which also means your odds of getting a moist fresh slice increases if you select a slice from the Cake that hasn't already been cut into, such as the one I had.

The Lemon Mousse Cake was a good recommendation.  It definitely had the Lemon acidity while the Angel Food(?) Cake layers were nicely airy/light.  Topped with White Chocolate shavings and a yummy Lemon Gummy I enjoyed while walking the few steps to meet Vivek(Toronto CM) & Friends to get my assigned Name Tag(WaYnE c.)."}
{"text":"Best take-out hot lunch, sandwich or salad in Leslieville. Real food prepared fresh. Recent reno and licensed restau. I've been eating here for probably 20 years. Never disappointed."}
{"text":"Friendly people. Good food made with love. It appears the main guy passes away a few years ago which is too bad. He was nice.

Excellent sandwiches with just the right mix of ingredients.  Again, made with love.

There's a delicious selection of pasta, including lasagna.  There are also some vegetarian options.  All very reasonable priced."}
{"text":"New spot that just recently opened not too long ago across from the Lakewood library. After getting some studying in at the library I got pretty hungry so I ventured across the street to give this place a try. The inside if very clean and modern looking. Very well lit and inviting. I found the menu to be pretty extensive so I will venture to say that there is something that will catch most everyone's taste. This time I ordered a small deep dish pizza and and an order of the 4 chicken fingers with Jojos. The fingers took some time to cook but they were well worth the wait. They were very hearty and came with a selection of a sauce . The fingers were evenly coated however not overwhelming. The coating was also very well flavored and crunchy. 

The pizza also was surprisingly good. (Usually the type of places that sell a lot of items are never really good at any of them but this place was actually pretty good. I'll def give it another try to explore some of the other items in the menu."}
{"text":"I quite like UpperCrust great healthy options, and the food was pretty delicious (veggie pizza one visit the other was roast beef) & quick to eat there or to take out"}
{"text":"Great pizza (gluten free and normal). Friendly staff (when you can get their attention.) Stick to take out or delivery. They're a little too busy for their own good. 

The Food: 
The menu was simple and wasn't too overwhelming like some pizza places that try to do too much. I ordered a gluten free Old School pizza with bell peppers, sausage, and pepperoni. It was some of the better gluten free crust I've ever had. They said on their menu that it was award winning, so I'm assuming it's a house made crust. The pizza was cooked well. It wasn't too crispy or burnt like some pizza joints end up doing with gluten free pizzas. It had a good thickness to it. Overall I really enjoyed it. Maybe just a little more sauce could have been added for my liking. Ask for some on the side if you like sauce. My girlfriend got a pepperoni pizza and cheese bread and raved about both. They also have Stubborn soda on fountain so you can get some unique pop if you are into that sort of thing. 

The Service: 
The service was really one of the only draw backs. They don't have a good system at the counter for funneling people into an order and pick up line or anything of the such. There were people standing around everywhere and they didn't know who was waiting for pickup, needing to order, etc so everyone was just getting missed. We stood for 5 min before being acknowledged. A simple, \"hey, we'll be with you in one moment.\" would have gone a long way. We ordered and waited an hour before our food got out. People after us got theirs before us. The manager came over and apologized and gave us gift cards which was a nice gesture that smoothed it over. If not for the great conversation with my lady we probably would have been a bit more frustrated. 

The Atmosphere:
They only have six 4-tops or so, so it's more of a pick up and head out type place. You're pretty close to other tables so if privacy is your thing you might want to dine elsewhere. Also, the commotion at the counter and confusion over there really affects you more than one would think. At least it did for me. 

Overall: 
The food was great. The service when dining in left a little to be desired. Next time we will order pickup or delivery and avoid dining in. If you want great gluten free pizza, check this place out for sure. The food alone is why I gave them a 4-star, that and the save by the manager with the gift cards without us even complaining showed they have good motives. Just still working out the kinks."}
{"text":"Me and a friend went there for last resort food and ended up really enjoying it. From the fresh ingredients displayed and watching It be made to conversations with our nice server/cashier Matt or Max."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick lunch. They have a selection of meatballs, lasagna (veggie/meat), pasta al forno, grilled chicken, and salads. Everything is homemade. On Friday's they have chilli (veggie/meat). I decided to try the vegetarian chili and added a side of roasted potatoes (all sides are $3.75 + tax, which I thought was kinda pricey considering the portions were not that big). 

The chilli was nice with loads of veggie goodness, chick peas, and beans. Bonus points for not overcooking the carrots. I always find that carrots in stews or soups end up being mushy, but these ones were still a little crunchy. The chilli was not spicy at all (which could be a pro or con depending on what you like). The potatoes were okay, but a bit overseasoned. 

The girl behind the counter was pretty nice and took the time to patiently go through all the different choices (they're in metal containers but with no labels). There are a few small tables at the front, or you can get your food to go. They also do catering. 

This place is okay, but prices are kind of steep for what you are getting."}
{"text":"I've eaten this pizza/chicken at least 5 times before leaving a review and to be honest it's quite good.  Crust, toppings and cheese are always on point.  The speciality pizzas are awesome as well.  The best way to describe he pizza and its toppings is \"hearty\"; this isn't Pizza Hut or dominos where you have a controlled amount of food, it's going to be a little different, ham isn't perfectly diced by a machine nor are the chunks of chicken.  Speaking of chicken, the fries chicken and tenders and really good.  Have to be hand battered because no way it is from a box.  Easily a 5 star rating for this place.  Anyone that says anything different isn't appreciative of craftsmanship in pizza and probably
thinks Digorno is 5 star pizza."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Lakewood. The Jersey George is well worth the money. The crust is perfect with an an awesome flavor. Everything I have had from here is good, especially their thick cut fries and chicken strips. If your looking for a new pizza place, this is it!"}
{"text":"Tried Upper Crust since it's a new business in Lakewood. The pizza is great! Ordered a 1/2 sheet with pepperoni for Football Sunday and it did not disappoint. The pieces were so large! Also got 10 breaded wings and 10 naked in the buffalo sauce. Wings were good...just need a spicier sauce! The price is very reasonable! Can't wait to try the specialty pizza's!"}
{"text":"What a great place! Thank you Amy for the wonderful customer service when I called with questions as I had never visited before. Our food was great. By far my new favorite pizza place and the chicken tenders are SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"After grabbing a Soy Chai Latte from Te Aro, I was heading back and decided last minute that I wanted a treat with my latte. On my way to Te Aro, I saw a place that looked interesting \"Upper Crust bakery\".  \"Eh, why not?\" I thought to myself. 

There, I witnessed one of my absolute favorites. CARROT CAKE. I just had to grab a piece. It was $4.80 after tax. Not bad, considering how big the piece was. Sadly, it looked better on display. I found it to be very crumbly and not moist enough. The icing was really sweet as well and didn't taste much like cream cheese, but a bite of cake and a sip of my latte did the trick. It was really funny though, I sat right infront of the window and not long after, two other people came in and ordered carrot cake after seeing my piece. I wonder if they felt the same way about their piece."}
{"text":"I went here with a girlfriend after wearing our tots out at the kiddie gym at L'il Beans.  We were attracted to the name (thinking it was a bakery, it is not) and the friendly bright yellow facade.  Once in the door it smelled so good and the menu looked reasonable so we decided to stay.  There's not much for seating maybe enough for 15 including the little two seater on the mini patio.

I had the chicken sandwich and felt at first that at $6 and change it was a bit steep.  No sides.  Admittedly it was deliciously seasoned with cilantro, not too much mayo, crisp lettuce, and the bun was cushy.  My friend had the lox sandwich and enjoyed it but felt the same about the pricing.  However, I was comfortably satiated after lunch but the can of ginger ale might have helped."}
{"text":"I had the most delicious crispy chicken and fries yesterday evening (Saturday, 17 Feb. 2018) that I will certainly be back here. This was my first time here.

I ordered ahead over the phone and picked up my food within 20 mins. I entered through the back which has a long hallway that leads you into the front entrance. It's quite beautiful as you walk in that hallway with the lights above. As I entered, I noticed a cool (and big) photo frame at the back entrance which added a nice touch to the place. Okay, enough on the ambiance. Let's get to the FOOD, shall we? 

FOOD -- I want to know the secret of how the chicken is cooked. I ordered 4 chicken tenders (with fries) which were actually quite large that I ended up saving the last piece for today. I got buffalo sauce on the side which added extra flavour to the chicken. The fries itself were yummy and had crispiness to it as well. At first I thought the meal was pricey but after I opened the box and saw how large the fries and chicken were then the price made a little more sense. 

INSIDE - small but very clean. There is a TV in there so come on in, eat, chat with your friend(s), and catch up on your latest show. Am I right? YES!!!!"}
{"text":"I tried Upper Crust in Lakewood for the first time in February. Why I waited so long to try is beyond me! Their chicken finger dinner is delicious- huge portions, fresh and hot. Loved the flavor - not overpowering, perfect. I've never tried their pizza, mostly because I'm hooked on their chicken and afraid I won't love the pizza as much...creature of habit."}
{"text":"Sadly, I wanted to like it. Pretty greasy. It also didn't help that the pizza arrived late and got smooshed to one side. Plenty of choices in Lakewood. This isn't a top 10"}
{"text":"I was anxious to try this place as I had never heard of it but I am a foodie. I decided to try the fried chicken but since I hate jo jos I had my favorite tater tots they were magnificent crisp hot and flavorful when I added salt and mustard wow! I then added fried chicken to my delivery order let me say I am a fried chicken connoisseur I have eaten all styles in 15 states and make excellent chicken myself but this was the best chicken I have ever eaten only one other place in cleveland comes close it was crunchy moist hot and had an outstanding flavor profile I highly recommend upper crust chicken I have yet to try their pizza I wish them much success in Lakewood."}
{"text":"I know many people that go here - more cause of location than anything at this point.
When I moved to the area 5 yrs ago I stopped by for a quick lunch - decided to get the soup. Loved it! I was home made from scratch! So many flavors! (only thing I didnt get was they called it minestroni and I thought that had bits of pasta with veggies but it only has veggies. But slowly but surely the taste of it has changed. More watered down, less veggies and less spices and the price has soared!!! They used to include a bun with it, then charged 30-50cents for a bun added with the soup. Then they raised the prices again! Crazy! so its almost 7$ for a soup, not including bun. Is it made of gold? I used to like their pizza as well. But the prices did not justify the quality.Previously, I have heard staff there say the food is organic - I really dont think so. 
I think the taste in the food has gone down because the origional staff who made the food are gone and the rest are skimping on quality and more focused on $$$. I havent been back for months.Mb I will go if Im really in a bind for food. In fact I just go to Amatos down the street for a reasonable priced filling pizza instead or go to shoppers down the street and get some microwave dinner for a much better price and tastier. 
Oh and btw, 5 min lining up here and you leave with your clothes smelling like the food - as if you were the one cooking it all day. Oh but the tinsy front patio is cute in the summer.
One good thing about it - is that it has actually forced me to make my own home made from scratch soup at home and bring it to work. I must say, I have surpassed the taste of their origional soup - yay! And I get to save $ as well!"}
{"text":"OMG the new Upper Crust is about the best pizza I've ever had, also had the chicken tenders, tender, juicy and Delicious upbeat staff always friendly will come back again and again price is a little steep but definitely worth it"}
{"text":"Great brunch spot.  Food was excellent, with my wife remarking that it was the best mushroom omelette she's ever had. 

Service was slow and a bit frantic, but I attribute that to a rush due to warmer weather and them not anticipating the number of people out for Sunday brunch, having 1 person in the kitchen and 1 server working. 

Hopefully its a consistent experience, will be back soon."}
{"text":"One of my neighbourhood faves for casual or quick food. Worlds best, ready to go, take out meat lasagna! Good \"old school\" bacon and eggs.  Montreal bagels. Mmm."}
