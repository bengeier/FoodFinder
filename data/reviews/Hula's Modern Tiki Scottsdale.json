{"text":"Great girls night dinner. Had the ahi tacos they were awesome. Drinks were great. Staff was wonderful. Would be a great place for date night or girls night. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"gives a nod to the Hawaiian theme but sort of lame with the decor. chicken bowl was awful. the texture when i chewed the chicken was scary, almost as if it were raw, but it wasn't pink so i think it was just low quality chicken. i had to send it back. I'm giving it 3 stars because the server didn't charge me for it."}
{"text":"Got a little taste of home in Old Town, Scottsdale. I ordered the Loco Moco and made the waitress smile when I asked for Tabasco... \"You must be from Hawaii!\" The food was good. We also tried the ceviche, fish tacos, and the fish cakes: all delicious. I have mixed reviews on the drinks: my drink tasted like plain/bland fruit punch (couldn't taste any rum), while my friend's drink was way too strong (she actually had to return the drink to get it fixed.) At least the margaritas were okay."}
{"text":"I am so happy that they moved closer to me. I've been a patron at their Central Ave location since forever but was always a pain to get to. I love their cocktails so to prevent any DUI it was always a $30 cab ride each way. No longer thanks to this new location!  The cocktails are good. The food is always delicious. I love the curry bowl, veggie burgers, tacos basically you can not go wrong with anything on the menu. Lots of vegetarian/vegan options."}
{"text":"Really nice place in Scottsdale.  The food and drinks were fantastic. The cocktails are a little pricey and that would be my only complaint.  Try the jerk chicken as it was phenomenal."}
{"text":"Wow! Everything was perfect.  First time and can't wait to go back. Next time I will try breakfast, the breakfast menu looked delicious.   Our waitress, Alexis, was timely, made great suggestions and was super friendly.   I almost forgot to mention the Mai Tai. It was easily the best one I've had, one was enough to get you there.  And finally,  the topper, there were no kids there!  This place meets my James Bond test."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place. Both locations are good, though we like the ambiance at the Phoneix location a bit more, they are both great. Their cocktails are good and strong, especially the Mai tai which is not too strong. My wife is vegetarian so there a ton of options for her, some which I even enjoy! For meat eaters, the tacos are great as is the burgers, but my favorite is the Ahi caesar  salad. A huge salad with fresh chunks of tuna mad mangoes, feels like your on the islands in the middle of scottsdale."}
{"text":"Drinks: Just fine, most cocktails on the sweeter side. limited hard liquor options.  Food: unlike others, do NOT recommend the coconut shrimp - too sweet, hardly any shrimp, highly recommend the ahi tuna wontons instead  service: sat at the bar. Very prompt and attentive."}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome food & service! We happen to stumble upon the grand opening & went in for a cocktail.  We returned the next day for lunch. Incredible food!!! I asked if Hula's has a sister restaurant in Monterey Ca.?  They do!  The Hula's in Monterey Ca. was one of the best meals we had in Monterey. Scottsdale was just as memorable! You have a serious hit on your hands!!! KUDOS!!!!! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great bar!  Got the Mai tai and it was yummy!  Great staff and service and very fun!  Would go back weekly if we could!"}
{"text":"Great spot for happy hour drinks and bites.  We had dinner here during Spring Training and were impressed with the asian fusion offerings and great prices on drink specials!  The ambiance is great with a wall of windows that all open up creating a great open atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Great food for decent prices.  The hula burger was pretty well cooked and I'm definitely considering coming back"}
{"text":"There was a ton of seating available and the hostesses were a hot mess. Rude, condescending and clearly have a problem seating people.  Happy hour loss on their part."}
{"text":"Yelp is a swindle! You can add every review you want they only keep the good ones for their clients restaurants Don't waste your time with that site!"}
{"text":"A little slow on the food delivery considering the crowd level (to their credit, we got $10 toward a future trip without complaining/asking). Not really \"Hawaiian\"  in the decor either, but it was nice enough. Chix tacos were okay, but the blacked Hapu fish sandwich was truly outstanding...like one of the best ever.  It's worth trying, but might not blow your socks off."}
{"text":"Great choice for Hawaiian Fusion food in a fun and unique atmosphere! I started out with a fresh and tasty seaweed salad that was large enough for 2 and priced at $4. I also had the house salad with a miso vinaigrette that was very good. Hubby had the pork potstickers with Thai peanut sauce that was just yummy and an order of Hawaiian chicken of skewers as well. Mariana was our most gracious server and took very good care of us, even going out of her way to inquire about a boot store for me from another staff. We had the Jamaican Jerk style pork and fresh Hapu fish served with mango salsa, rice and Jamaican"}
{"text":"Service can make or break a dining experience. My waitress did the latter.   Although the atmosphere was nice - it could not make up for the waitress. I had the pleasant experience of having her curse at me dismissively for no reason.   Truly, I have never had a ruder waitress. And I have friends and family who were in the service industry. I know the reality of waiter's hard word - and how they can have crummy days... but this was beyond that. She was just rude with no regard for the person I was with or me.  If I wanted to feel shitty about myself - I could have stayed home and tried to cook.   But the bartender was nice, the food was okay - I just wish I could say the same about my server. But meh... I don't have to spend my money here. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Ridiculously good eats...the chef has brought together the most flavorful combos it's perfection on a platter. The service here was stellar, Tyler made sure we had everything we needed the entire time and gave great recommendations.  Highly recommend: Island style poke: couldn't stop eating it! Mango chicken Caesar: mango and Caesar? who knew? with the grilled slightly spicy (heavily flavorful) this was eaten to the last leaf Coco Joes chicken plate (with rice and beans): so so good (repeat x 10)  Sides: The avocado side is 1/4 a whole avocado (which was perfectly ripe) Shiitakes: cooked to perfection  Wasabi mashed: pretty good, not my all time favorite Sundae: 3 scoops of ice cream with a chocolate drizzle and macadamia nuts  Cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The brunch-Happy Hour is the bomb, I loved the Loco Moco and the Ceviche was off the hook. I will recommend this place to my friends."}
{"text":"Great food & terrific service. We shared potstickers & beef skewers which were tender & cooked perfectly. Our dinner choices included macadamia nut encrusted mahi, a black bean burger, Thai chicken rice bowl & south seas fish tacos. Everyone loved their entree & our huge tiki drinks some of which are huge enough to share."}
{"text":"I have lived in Honolulu for a number of years and I go back to the islands every year so I am quite partial to Polynesian cuisine.  Further, I have been a breakfast person for over 40 years and have frequented every breakfast restaurant in Scottsdale to the point that I am considered a member of the family at each.  Many years ago I tried the Loco Moco plate at \"Da Kitchen\" in Kahalui, Maui and I was hooked.  Ever since that time I judge a Hawaiian restaurant by the presentation of their Loco Moco dish.  I found Hula's Modern Tiki only this past week (after being in place for 14 months) and of course you know what I ordered :))).  A slight variation on the original dish, but their own touch, that I enjoyed very much.  I went back two times already to try other dishes and each one took me back to the islands with their flavors.  This place is the closest thing that you are going to find \"Da kine\" in Hawaii.  I am so glad they are in Scottsdale.  One suggestion:  Scottsdale is a breakfast town, not a brunch town; and if you are going to open in the morning on weekends you have to open before 9AM.  Even church people won't wait until 9:30 or 10 for a restaurant to open.  Look up the street and see those other restaurants that are over crowded by 9AM.  Your breakfast is better than theirs, get it out there!!!!!!!  Advertise your existence in the Scottsdale section of the Az Republic."}
{"text":"We loved this place! It was a little bit loud, and our table was kind of close to the people next to us, but the atmosphere was fun, and the food was amazing. Our tropical drinks were really delicious, and the service was excellent. This place wins for uniqueness. And the Old Town location is convenient to all the fun shopping. We ordered all appetizers, and they were excellent. We highly recommend the crispy coconut shrimp rolls. They are outstanding!"}
{"text":"Last night we went there after reading about it on yelp. I was definitely impressed :-)   On Wednesdays they have all night happy hour, so we started off with The Zombie (a rum pineapple drink) and I got their specialty margarita. My boyfriend hates rum so he just chugged his haha but the margarita was super good :)   Got sweet potatoe fries and pork race for an app. Both were BOMB. The pork was so amazing I got the Pork Luau Plate with coleslaw and macaroni salad, I definitely recommend it :)  I will be coming back here soon, especially because the service was very good."}
{"text":"I wish I could be more articulate with my review but there's just no words for the difference in service between the Scottsdale location and downtown phx. As a very understanding,  generous guest with well over a decade in the business I can not think of any reason to try to the Scottsdale location again. Simply awful service time after time . But, if you are ever in the downtown area I highly recommend this restaurant as their food, cocktails, and service are top notch. Family,  friends, and business associates alike will enjoy the experience and I would hate for anyone to be deterred after visiting the Scottsdale location."}
{"text":"Came into town and stumbled upon this restaurant - we were intrigued by the \"modern hula\" vibe. We ordered the fish bites and chicken wings which were delicious. Interesting take on their lobster bisque with Siracha flavor. The ribs were delicious over a bed of sweet potato fries. Portions were very ample as well. We would have given 5 stars but they were out of their Mac n Cheese. Mai Tai was good but very strong - I mean 3 sips into it and I was almost drunk! (Yes, I'm a lightweight but still!) Great place and we would come again!"}
{"text":"Great place to go for fun drinks!! Me and a friend went here for lunch and the food was amazing. The atmosphere is very true to the name of the place-it's tropical! I ordered a cheeseburger with bacon on it and it was very good. The only thing bad I have to say is that the waitress that was assigned to us wasn't too friendly. It wasn't that she was nasty towards us, but she just seemed to not want to be there and was very unenthusiastic about it. Besides that slight issue, I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a good time."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time the other night for dinner with a couple of friends The waiter was down-to-earth and attentive. I started with the Painkiller for a cocktail, which was absolutely delicious. I also had the Market Ahi Sashimi for an appetizer which was also delicious. Perfect texture and was very fresh. But then when I went to the main entrée, my experience kind of changed. I ordered the loco moco. I have had some really good Hawaiian dishes, so I would like to say that I have a good taste for Hawaiian food, but the loco moco was NOT good. The patty had absolutely no flavor, and the so-called mushroom gravy was way too salty. But it did have a good atmosphere and good drinks and appetizers, so my boyfriend and I decided we should go there again and try out their breakfast. The following day my boyfriend and I went for brunch. I started with a bloody mary, and it was great!!! I also ordered the Crispy Coconut Shrimp rolls as an appetizer. They had unique flavor at first, but then when I started to get into it, they did not taste so good. Almost too unique of a flavor for such a simple dish. Then I ordered another bloody mary, it was awful! Basically pure vodka. So then I asked the waitress can I please get this remade. She took it and came back and said he just put it in this glass and added mix to it.... I was like okay.... I'm pretty sure you are not supposed to tell the customer that and I'm pretty sure when a customer asks you to have it remade it means REMADE. I slowly started not liking the place after that... Then I ordered the Portuguese sausage benedict... Again, I know my benedicts and this one was not good. I rated this place with 3 stars because it has good intentions and good dishes, but needs to change around the menu a bit for it to be entirely successful."}
{"text":"Pleasant surprise. This space has continuously failed but I think that streak has come to an end. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The only thing good was the poke the Mac salad tasted like Walmart brand Mac salad good atmosphere though! Good service"}
{"text":"I am from out of town and never been to AZ before. This place had some amazing food!! My husband had the macadamia nut encrusted mahi and I had the the blackened halibut with wasabi mash. Both were great but the macadamia dish took that round! Compliments to the chef!"}
{"text":"Man I love this place and moved away about a year ago so coming here was on my list for sure! First off what is wrong with this bartender is my first comment... Was not hospitable in any fashion, barely saw him smile, didn't try to connect the dots with us! Really really disappointed in my visit. Plus my food came out after my friends were done eating! Heard another guest who I assume works here ask him why he was such a dick for throwing silverware and the check at her! I would seriously have a chat with the gentleman working behind the bar 5/18 PM shift, who I know has worked here for quite some time. Would love to tell his name but was never given it! Great specials and food but people come out to eat for the experience and he made me feel like We were an inconvenience  Sorry for the bad review guys!"}
{"text":"The food was great, service was good.  Good, fresh take on Island food. Shrimp tacos were delicious, the black bean burger was also very good. Nice, casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"Our party of 4 all loved every part of our meal at Hula's!  The food was delicious and full of flavor with just enough spice to make it interesting.  There was a great atmosphere with fresh air flowing through the restaurant and an upbeat environment.  The service was above average.  We will return again and again."}
{"text":"Modern atmosphere for sure. Where are the grass umbrellas and hula skirt waitresses? The only thing hula is the cups they serve their really overpriced drinks in. We only had drinks, but admit the food smelled good and the menu was intriguing. We will have to save up to try this place again."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch, ordered spicy chicken bowl and ahi tuna bowl.  Both were excellent, big portions.  Word of warning the chicken bowl is with curry and is spicy!!  Place has a great vibe, good background music, not too loud, feels happening.  Service is good, efficient, and quick. Overall good experience and good food."}
{"text":"Nothing special about this place. The food is ok. The service was terrible. They do have a few good beers on tap but nothing so great that I will go back.  And now upon reviewing our Amex statement we were over charged for our meal. A very disappointing experience all together!"}
{"text":"I ordered Polynesian chicken sandwich... Taste awful, the chicken taste like rubber and smell fishy. I asked to take the sandwich back and order shrimp taco which taste much better. And our server seems to disappear never comeback to refill our water."}
{"text":"Just want everyone to know, we Gave Hula's Scottsdale another chance: had a wonderful experience.  Greeted right away at the bar by Rachael.  We actually felt welcome.  Far different experience from the last time.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch is nice, $2 mimosas. Lunch menu is available as well, reasonable prices, especially for Scottsdale. Service great, terrific food, very comfortable ambiance. Would've been a 5 star review if food was hot, not warm, when served"}
{"text":"I had a great experience here. My good friend chose to have his birthday dinner here. It was a few of us so we had a bit of a wait to get a table but totally understandable since we didn't make reservations not call ahead. Service drinks and food was great!"}
{"text":"Found this via Yelp.  Really great find. Lived the atmosphere.  Great service. Interesting items.  We ordered several appetizers instead of an entree. We like tapa style dining.  Reasonable pricing. Tuesday night is. 2 appetizers and 2 cocktails for $20. CAnt beat that!!"}
{"text":"Awesome Mai Tai's! Fish taco's were delightful!! Happened upon this spot on Yelp knowing some of the BEST Scottsdale restaurant FINDS are in Old Town... PAY A VISIT! Get your Mai Tai 'ON"}
{"text":"The hubby and I ordered the starter ceviche REALLY GOOD! I had the ahi tacos also REALLY GOOD it came with white rice and black beans. The hubby ordered shrimp mango Ceasar salad awesome combo!! Service was outstanding extremely helpful on deciding what to order. Great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Rare steak came out well done. Next steak came out longer than a rare should take. Came out rare BUT...unseasoned. Took away a half full portion of mac n cheese without even asking if we were done with it. Waitress Combined our checks into one check when even from the start, we had specified how we were splitting the checks making us wait even longer to leave."}
{"text":"My new favorite place. So much fun. Good drinks and food, great service (thanks Ronnie). Can't wait to try Sunday brunch!"}
{"text":"My lady friend and I tried this place out last week for date night, and we had an awesome time.  We were seated at the end of one of the long communal tables, which was perfect.  The place was busy but not too noisy for conversation.  Our first round was a Scorpion and a blood orange martini and we split an order of the fish bites -- 5 stars on the drinks and the wonderful fish bites and tarter sauce.  Our second round was a Mai tai and I forget what the other drink was (but it was good), and we split an order of the shrimp rolls -- 5 stars on the drinks and the shrimp roils.  The service couldn't have been better, and as it was a Wednesday night, it was happy hour prices all night!  It couldn't have been a better evening, and I know Hula's will come up on the rotation again sometime soon.  Fun place, highly recommended."}
{"text":"I use to live in Central Phoenix and regularly made trips to the Hula's on Central Ave. When the Scottsdale Hula's opened I was ecstatic! The staff is all really friendly and every time my husband and I visit the waiters remember us and chat us up.  The food is so good... All of the tacos are great and if you are just going to have snack the appetizer menu is quite impressive.  I think the only thing I have had that I was on the fence about was the calamari strips.  I'm a huge fan of the ceviche and ahi! The Dr. Funk and Painkiller are great drinks for anyone looking to enjoy their all Wednesday happy hour and the seasonal Longboard beers are great too! I would strongly suggest this place! I am giving this four stars only because the patio seating is so small and I feel like I can never get a table outside.  Living in Scottsdale, I personally love to take advantage of the outdoors. However, if you don't mind being inside they have a great and spacious seating arrangement with a retracting wall to bring in the fresh air."}
{"text":"We were there on Wednesday - just happened to be happy hour all day. Great drink specials and tasty appetizers. The shrimp rolls were fantastic!"}
{"text":"Gave this Place another try the other night. As always a great atmosphere and there were many people in the restaurant mid week. Sat at the bar again and the bartender was very attentive and very nice. We ordered the beef and chicken bowls which were delicious and had a unique flavor to them. The restaurant and bathrooms are extremely clean as well! I will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"The drinks are excellent, prime location in old town scottsdale. The bowls and pork are recommended. Tried a Tahitian beer for the first time in the Tiki House. Really cool restaurant with a perfect atmosphere."}
{"text":"Loved eating here.   Very modern.  Friendly attentive bartenders and wait staff.    You can eat inside or out.  I had the spicy Caesar salad with shrimp and mango!   Decor was fabulous!"}
{"text":"Love this place for the food and atmosphere! Service sometimes seems a little slow but then again I am typically there with 10 plus people. Always a good place to start your sunday funday!"}
{"text":"The food was good but it did take a while to come out. Not sure if it was due to Sunday brunch. The tables were also too close together. Location is in a great spot easy for find parking though. Overall it was an ok experience."}
{"text":"They have a gluten free menu posted on their website, including a variety of tacos with corn tortillas!   I ordered the grilled shrimp tortillas to go. Subbed the pesto sauce for island roumalade. So delicious! Just wish there were a couple more shrimp (there were 8 in my takeout box). Side of white rice and black beans. Will definitely be back to try the other taco options."}
{"text":"We were in town visiting family and for my husband to interview for jobs in late August. We stopped into Hula's after wandering around Old Town on a weekday afternoon. It was very hot out and the restaurant was understandably quite empty. Chicago has a good tiki scene so we were happy to come across Hula's. We each had one drink and enjoyed the air conditioning for awhile. Way better prices than Chicago!"}
{"text":"Hawaiian fusion in Scottsdale! Hula's was delish and flavored spot on. Polynesian fusion in a modern setting. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We went on a Tuesday with a group of 8. Everyone sort of showed up at their own pace, so we had friends that had already ordered food when we showed up. However our server gave us menus and got our drinks and everything started out fine. My boyfriend and I wanted to get a couple of appetizers, but our server dropped off beers at the other end of the table and never came back. We waited and all had our drinks and he never came back to get our orders. By the time he came back we decided it wasn't worth it to us to wait even longer for refills or food and asked for our bill. He then proceeded to wander around and not get us our bill for another 20 minutes. There were probably less than 5 other groups in the restaurant at the time. We didn't get to try anything. I have nothing about it that would make me want to come back."}
{"text":"Wow, this really couldn't have been MUCH worse... The sweet potato fries were unseasoned and under cooked... The luau pork sandwich, the one they say on the menu is \"heaven on a bun\" tasted like rehydrated beef jerky... It was so gross, I took one bite, my girlfriend took one bite.... and that was it. The waitress didn't come by once to check, until we had been sitting there for some time... She picked up the plate and my girlfriend said \"that was really terrible\" about the food. The girl looked the other way and walked away. Another ten minutes goes by and we get our check... The waitress was beyond rude and obnoxious, the food was terrible. I would NOT recommend."}
{"text":"Service average. You have to ask for another drink. Food was average. No wow factor. I was lucky enough to sit right by the hall to the bathrooms so I could watch every wait until the restroom became available. Poor design of use of space. My wife had the snapper and she said it was fair. Our guest had another fish and said it was OK. I had the Hulu Burger with cheese. They forgot the cheese. There are 100's of restaurants in Scottsdale. This one will not get a second chance."}
{"text":"We live across the street from Hula's and are always looking for good late-night food. Came in last week for the 1st time. Unfortunately, we were in a hurry because we had a movie to catch. Our server (Charlie?) was great, we put in our order right away and had our dinner in less than 10 minutes. I had the Cajun Burger, which was cooked a perfect medium rare and delicious, and my BF had the Mongolian Beef Bowl which he enjoyed as well.  We have been back twice since then when we had more time to sit and enjoy our meals!"}
{"text":"I visited this location a few days ago for dinner with friends. First, the food is really good but unfortunately I will most likely never go back simply because of the service. Our waiter was having a bad night, maybe...he was just flat out rude. We only see each other once a month and it should be a fun time filled with laughter and happiness. We will not waste one more second to go back on the chance we get the same guy. Sad because again the food was really good and that is why I still gave 3 stars and not 1.  3/28/16: You are never given a second chance to make a first impression but good customer service goes a long way. I appreciate the sincere response to my post and because of that I will give 4 stars and I will give Hula's another try...again, the food was delish! I will also muster up the courage to ask to speak to a manager and ask for a different server if the vibe isn't right! Thanks Hula's for turning my frown upside down :)"}
{"text":"Drinks - 4 stars  Food - 3 stars  Service - 3 stars  Atmosphere - 3 stars  Been here twice now.. First time I had lunch and drinks. We had their curry bowls and it was delicious! Told friends about our first good experience so we all decided to try their happy hour. Drinks were great but food was very disappointing. We ordered almost everything on their happy hour because we (5 of us) stayed for almost 3 hours waiting for other friends.. Needless to say.. Waitress was getting irritated w us at that point. Oh well.. We are paying customers so we continued to wait and drink.. Next time, we stick w the curry bowls and go only during happy hour for drinks."}
{"text":"The BEST casual dining experience in a long time! This was highly recommended on our Scottsdale Segway Tour, and they were spot on. Great drinks, happy hour, and the food my wife and I had were awesome! The staff from the hostess to the Management is as friendly and welcoming as you will ever find in a restaurant. We will most certainly recommend to our friends and be back!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed having dinner and drinks at Hula's before a night out in Old Town. The drinks were large and strong and the food was tasty! The decor was modern, not so much Tiki flavor (except reggae music). The service we received was good. I did really enjoy the food: Thai fish cakes were particularly delicious, and we enjoyed the fish tacos as well. I'd come back for the food, for sure."}
{"text":"Came here twice and both times had the mai tais, sweet potato fries, and tuna tacos. The mai tais are awesome and strong (how I like them) and I would keep coming back for those alone. Sweet potato fries with the dipping sauce were delicious, and tuna tacos were also good."}
{"text":"A few girlfriends and I stopped at Hula's for happy hour drinks and a very late lunch (3:15pm). When the hostess sat us, she informed us lunch prices would be ending in 15 minutes, so we should hurry up and order from the lunch menu if we wanted to. My friend and I ordered a $2 mimosa (before they ended at 3:30 also), and our waiter said mimosas ended at 3:30. My friend said it was only 3:15 and asked what the problem was, like why couldn't we get one if we still had 15 minutes. The waiter reluctantly agreed and came back with our drinks. I ordered one taco from the lunch menu (not a huge appetite and good prices, so why not?) and again the waiter gave us so much attitude and it wasn't even 3:30 yet! I have no idea what his deal was, and again the hostess told us to hurry up and order before 3:30. He probably was hoping we'd order from the dinner menu and regular drink prices to up his tip. My taco was good, but the side of rice/beans was pretty cold and dry. I was the one who recommended Hula's to my friends, but it didn't live up to prior expectation!"}
{"text":"Happy hour was amazing! The waiter was soooo helpful! He literally explained everything. And we were extremely needy. His name is Juan Carlos.   Literally best service"}
{"text":"As a huge fan of the Phoenix location and now a resident of Old Town Scottsdale, I was beyond stoked to know that I live less than 2 miles away from the new location. Dana is a great owner and the staff at both locations are amazing. Location in Old Town is perfect and the decor is always on point, I would totally live on the patio! As a vegetarian, their menu stands out for me compared to other restaurants. I can't get enough of their Big Sur Black Bean Burger. You may be thinking, \"Grrrrreat. ANOTHER veggie burger for the non meat people\".. No way, this burger is perfect, not bland and is AWESOME with added avocado. The tofu tacos and bowls are fantastic too. To the reviewer who said that everything was a little spicy.. Well, I'm sorry to burst your bubble but it is pacific islander style food. It's meant to have a kick and boy does it rule. The drink list is a lot of fun as well, I always look forward to a Tiki Bastard or good old fashion Zombie! Thanks Hula's, you have a regular for as long as I'm in Arizona :)"}
{"text":"Wow!  What a huge difference from our last visit to Hula's!  We went on a crowded and very busy Friday night.  We were seated immediately by a very polite hostess.  I asked our waiter about gluten free options and was given a new menu, and told if I had any questions he would gladly ask the chef.  I had the Spicy Chicken Taco, they were great.  Definitely adding this back to our list for future visits."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant because you can eat and see out side which is very historical and nice streets. I like this restaurant because they offer wide variety of food and drinks. This restaurant is not really big nor really small. Perfect to come with family or friends upto 5.   However food takes way too long.. And employees are kind of scary. The food was soooooo good. I really loved the food they served."}
{"text":"Excellent place. Great staff. I loved the beers and the food."}
{"text":"Had a great experience. Was at Scottsdale for the SF Giants Spring Training. Food was excellent. Went there for dinner, and literally went back the next morning for breakfast. Juan Carlos was our waiter Sunday morning. Great guy."}
{"text":"Food was great. We got there exactly one hour before closing time and the hostess, the waiter, AND bartender all reminded us they close in one hour. I get it!  You want to go home however it's not like we walked in at 10 til closing time. Unfortunately, we probably won't be back :("}
{"text":"We came in here while in a work trip and everyone loved the atmosphere, service, and food. From the salads to the chicken sandwich all of it was awesome. They had to peel a couple of the people from the Mac n cheese as it is amazing and we finished it off with the key lime pie. Loved everything about this place and would recommend!"}
{"text":"Looking for a place that serves a delicious drink in a ginormous ceramic bowl with a flaming volcano in the middle? Well look no further, pull up a chair (and super long straw!) and drink your troubles away!  If you don't wanna get too tipsy (like I did lol), order some crispy coconut shrimp rolls (the pineapple dipping sauce is AH-mazing!), shrimp tacos or luau pork plate to fill your tummy.  I've never been to Hawaii, but if the food's anything like they have at Hula's I seriously need to go there ASAP.  Everything tastes as good as it looks in my photos - seriously salivating and thinking about when I can head back here again :)"}
{"text":"Great happy hour specials and nice drinks ! The parking is also great , especially since it's downtown"}
{"text":"Hula's is located in downtown Scottsdale. It was a huge disappointment on all fronts. The server was not friendly, never smiled and wouldn't or couldn't offer any recommendations that were helpful. The two different drinks I had off the menu were light on the liquor and heavy on the sugar - even though I requested all the sugar/simple syrup to be removed. The food was incredibly bland. I had the shrimp tacos - the shrimp were dry and flavorless, the tortilla was soggy and tasted like flour. Besides the tiki head at the entrance, there is nothing tiki about this place. NOTE: I dined at this restaurant in June 2015 (not September when I posted the review)"}
{"text":"We stopped here for lunch and sat at the bar for lunch.  The lady helping us was very sweet, attentive, and offered great service.   I ordered one grilled fish taco and it came with a side of rice and black beans on top.  The rice had a coconut cream drizzled on it.   Tasty fish taco with some spice.  My husband ordered the spicy shrimp Caesar salad and it was definitely a huge portion and flavorful.  Great stop for lunch!"}
{"text":"Totally solid place! Excellent drink selections to include a variety of beers on draft. I went with a Tuna Steak sandwich. It was really awesome, a fresh high quality tuna steak that was seasoned and cooked to perfection and presented alongside a large pile of sweet potatoe fries made me happy I can here for my lunch while in the area. The service was fast and friendly and even made sure we didn't forget our leftovers!"}
{"text":"Had a nice lunch there.  Even on a warm day the restaurant is very comfortable and airy with the front open.   We ate the shrimp tacos, excellent, the calamari sandwich, good, and the teriyaki chicken.  My only negative is the hot spice that is put on the pineapple that goes on the chicken....  Not mentioned on the menu and an unpleasant surprise for the guest eating it!  Other than that, great venue, attentive service, good drinks, we will be back"}
{"text":"Let me tell you,  I returned today for late lunch with my sweetie, and the food and service were fantastic.  The food was hot,  huge portions (didn't stop us, though! ), and served with elegant understated hospitality.  We were able to enjoy ourselves,  chat,  and eat great food.  I would have stayed longer if we had more time just to linger with a drink and enjoy the open wall to the beautiful Scottsdale winter temperatures.  Nicely done Hulas."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 1 star because that's the level of brain activity that the hostess with the black hair and pound-heavy mascara had with me tonight. My friends and I were heavily underquoted on a wait time, then talked to like we were members of her rival sorority (assuming she's not in her 6th semester at SCC). She literally said \"I'm like, not sure you guys are gunna get a table\"- after we already waited. We elected to help shorten her wait list by removing ourselves from it."}
{"text":"Do a zombie over a mai tai. Way better drink. Hawaiian vs Tiki menu (where's the 60's pupu platter?) but well prepared and excellent service. Blackened ahi was served perfectly- scare the crap out of the fish with the griddle then remove for rare tasty fish.   And hey, treat your wait staff nice. There was this party with a Ed Hardy shirt wearing mo-fo being a rich douche to our waitress. She was fab. Dude was being a douchebro."}
{"text":"There at lunch, had nice but small amount of outside seating, but the whole wall was open so it was really very enjoyable. it is located in the old town Scottsdale area. My husband and I each ordered a cocktail, a hurricane, it was very good. I had the spicy Thai chicken bowl and my husband had fish taco with rice. He really enjoyed his, but I have to say mine was amazing. It had a base of White rice, a layer of thinly slice cabbage for nice light crispness, a light layer of black beans and then some delicious chicken with a Thai spicy sauce poured over the top. It was very filling, beautiful to look at, and most importantly delicious! The service was quick, friendly, and efficient.  We will be back."}
{"text":"The ambiance here seems fun and the food was good and reasonably priced. I had a banana tiki drink that was fun. I had the tofu bowl, which is huge!! Super filling as well. It had perfectly crispy tofu on top of rice, beans and plantains. A great green sauce was on it as well. I also tried the wasabi mashed potatoes, didn't really taste the wasabi though. The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars was the service was off. The table was dirty when she sat me down even though it was a slow night so there were plenty of other options! It had sauce splashes all over I had to wipe myself because it took some time for the waiter to have time to come over...even though there were maybe only 6 other tables at the time. I'd go again with a group. Vegetarian friendly."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints me! Amazing food! I Love the Ahi tacos with that amazing sauce! So delicious!! Definitely my go to place when in Old town Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Couldn't have asked for better breakfast.  Forget the breakfast club,  morning squeeze, daily dose or the other old town breakfast joints.  Hula's is the new place to go."}
{"text":"Very good for a casual night out in the air!  Coconut tacos are awesome!  And a Dr. Funk...good food...good drinks...nice atmosphere...coffee could be better"}
{"text":"YES, YES, YES! I wen't here solo on a Saturday night and man did I luck out! I had the Blackened Ahi, and man was it delicious! Perfectly cooked rare, with a blackened crust that really made a statement. The staff was great, but did not hover as sometimes happens when I'm solo. I'll keep this in mind for my next Scottsdale visit for sure! Great place to take a date too!"}
{"text":"Hula's is a pretty cool spot.  Its a tad small but clean & cozy.  The name was a bit misleading, as I did not see one tiki, coconut bra or hula dancer anywhere.  Positives would include  weekend happy hours, a dog friendly patio and good location.  Weekend evenings can get pretty crowded, but its pretty open during lunch, and a good option for post work happy hour.   Tip -try the pineapple mimosa"}
{"text":"Love so many things on this menu! Steak sandwich, black bean burger, fish bites, steak and chicken skewers...I could go on and on. Staff is great!  You need Hulas in your life!"}
{"text":"Was in town for a wedding and stayed with friends who took us here for dinner... and wow it was just what I needed! The wait was about 30-40 minutes for a Sunday night.. so we walked around Downtown. Once we were seated, our waitress was very attentive and helped us promptly. They had fun cocktail drinks! I ordered the Mongolian Beef Bowl ($13) and it was worth it. I had leftovers and it tasted amazing. The vibe was casual yet intimate if you don't sit near the bar. I'd say this place had great quality food for a decent price! Wish they had this in LA!"}
{"text":"We explored old town Scottsdale and stopped into Hula's Modern Tiki for a late lunch.  The restaurant wasn't busy at this time of the afternoon, yet we found the staff to be unfriendly.  The hostess really didn't greet us, just walked us to the table, tossed the menu's down and walked away.  Our server came over and she was very nice which was refreshing.  Another guy stopped by the table and Mr. Bee asked a question and the way he answered the question was so condescending.  So we came to the conclusion the bartender who was also taking our order was the only person who was friendly.  We found the menu to have some eclectic and interesting dishes with several vegetarian options.  Mr. Bee ordered Lobster bisque which was delicious.  The soup was creamy with chunks of perfectly cooked lobster.  I ordered a curry tofu dish over rice with black beans and caramelized plantains that was scrumptious.  Seasoned very well and spicy.  The plantains cut through the spice and added a lovely sweetness to the dish.  The drinks were very good and we loved the tiki glasses they were served in.  Just wish the staff would have been more fun."}
{"text":"Hula's is a great spot for a yummy meal with an island vibe! I've been to the Central Phoenix location a few times but this was my first visit to the Old Town Scottsdale location. Deets on the eats:  -Pink Bikini Martini: tasted like a watermelon jolly rancher! It was sweet and tangy, but I definitely could not have had more than one (probably a good thing!)   -Mai Tai: My boyfriend ordered this drink. It was a bit too strong for my tastes but he really enjoyed it.   -Ceviche: Really tasty! The fish is nice and fresh and comes served with crispy wonton chips. The citrus in the dish was a nice touch but I think it could have been toned down just a tad.   -Mongolian Beef Bowl: Great flavor! The bowl comes with grilled beef, black beans, rice, shredded cabbage and a lime curry sauce. My one complaint is that it's served in a huge bowl that's 75% cabbage. I have had this dish once for takeout and it seemed way more proportional. In the restaurant, there was just a few bites of beef and I wanted a bit more as it was so tasty!  -Duke's Pork Luau Plate: this dish features pineapple pulled pork with a soy glaze, rice, and coleslaw. Super flavorful!   Our server was very attentive and the food came out very promptly. I will definitely be back to try more from their extensive menu."}
{"text":"Excellent service, the best quality of fish I have had since moving from newport beach, ca.  Great service and atmosphere, a gem in old town"}
{"text":"Haven't tried the food yet. I will just didn't get to it. I was the DD so only sips of the designated drunks drinks for me but the happy hour is DAILY & tasty. The staff was helpful & not too rushed to answer questions which is always nice. The food looked yum-my. Def have to come back & try the food. Stay tuned for that."}
{"text":"Wow...what to say... Mike is just a gem of a bartender. I came in on veterans to have a couple drinks and mike made this day the best Veterans Day to date. The food is awesome. The service? Even better. I promise you hulas won't disappoint. Great times, great food, great people. America...the home of the free...because of the brave."}
{"text":"We looked at the menu before hand, and saw there was a lot that we [thought] we could eat - being gluten free. We were wrong, it was difficult to find things to eat. What we chose were sweet potato fries and pot stickers. Both were delicious.   The drink menu is enticing and fun! When we got our drinks they were as delicious as the menu makes them out to be. They also had bowls of alcohol to share with someone else.   The environment was trendy and fun. Probably for a younger crowd (early 30's and younger)."}
{"text":"Loved the Seared Ahi Tuna Sandwich and Lobster Bisque! I would pass on he macaroni salad next time as well as the shrimp coconut rolls did not have much flavor.   Great beer selection and the service was good as well!"}
{"text":"Great Food and amazing value. The drinks are strong and well priced and the vibe is cool. What more could you want?  Try the appetizers (shrimp rolls and fish cakes)  The tiki bastard and Mai tai are well made drinks here worth trying."}
{"text":"Food was super fresh with nice flavors. Awesome service and food came out really fast. We're from Hawaii and although it wasn't authentic hawaiian, it was pretty darn close. Very flavorful fusion fare!"}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever gotten from not only the bar manager but from the general manager as well. They do it every they can to not accommodate you for their happy hour pricing and then I was cut off after 1 drink. Ronnie,The general manager is the person to blame regarding any sort of mishaps with my bill and with my service at this horrible location. I would be so embarrassed if I own this place or if I manage this place. I spend money to dine in nice places and to be served by proper servers however hula in Scottsdale does not have this going on. I was there on Thursday and I was there tonight on Saturday, July 4 Independence Day, and have never received such poor service or disrespect by general manager And a bar manager both times. Aside from your employees stealing and serving undercooked food that gets people sick I hope your location allows you to last more than a few months. I've never been so disrespected at a restaurant and have no problem telling every single person I know that Hula treats people like shit. I am personally saying Ronnie is to blame. I hope the owner of the restaurant called me to apologize for his lack of intuition when hiring a general manager. By the way the pork is generally undercooked and has made a few people I know come home with food poisoning. Thank you Hula in Scottsdale for being such a disrespectful.dirty place to dine while being treated like shit. Again Ronnie is to blame."}
{"text":"I came here for a friend's birthday. It was the perfect spot for a celebratory dinner before heading out to Old Town. I had to do a Mai Tai because...it's their signature! It was awesome. Everyone had great drinks, actually, and our server kept them coming. The service was great even though we had a table of like 15 girls. This is a great choice for a date night, special occasion, or just a Saturday. Loved the fun but sort of mysterious atmosphere."}
{"text":"Love the concept of a Hawaiian restaurant; it's an original idea. The drinks are lots for fun too and add nicely to the theme. And the food--surprisingly pretty tasty! Got the fish tacos and was not disappointed! Cute decor too!"}
{"text":"Too bad the tiki culture is poorly used to decorate this establishment. It's just an excuse to have some beachy vibe in downtown Scottsdale. The food is fine - I had the Asian tofu salad and hubby got the fried fish sandwich.  Their drink list is fun. Every one makes their mai tai differently so it's cool to experience it. Its very lively here even on a Tuesday night."}
{"text":"Place is nice and clean and that's about it. Food was horrible and service was ok but took over 30 minutes and my burger was cold. Not coming back here again."}
{"text":"Delicious food per usual--love the building and service. I do love the other hulas location a bit more because of its awesome, giant patio. But it is super nice to have the options of delicious Mongolian beef bowl closer to home!"}
{"text":"Cute bar off Scottsdale road, great happy hour! Spicy edamame and great sweet potato fries, some thought the house dip was too sweet but I thought it had the right amount of zest.  Mai Tai's were unconventional but delicious and strong.  Friendly attentive staff throughout."}
{"text":"Love it.. one of our new favorite places.. great service, atmosphere, food and drinks.  Insane Thai Chicken Bowl and Mai Tai's!"}
{"text":"I typically prefer going here for breakfast because it's sooooo freakin good! Lunch of dinner is good but I need to be in the mood. I recommend the cajun burger if you do though. 4 stars for slow service the past three times I've gone.  Did I mention they play really good music? That's key for me. If they played some bumpkin country music it wouldn't be as cool ya know what I mean?"}
{"text":"This is a fun bar and restaurant in Old Town. I'm a fan!  The tiki motif reminds me of classic Hawaii, maybe from the 1950s...and their drinks have that aloha vibe. Try the pineapple wine, a dark and stormy, or their Mai Tai. All are delicious!  They have a full list of cocktails and fun drink concoctions that they make...it's hard to choose!  They have a full bar and you can order munchies or a meal at the bar, or get a table (or patio table and watch the people of Old Town walk by).   I've only had drinks and apps the several times I've been here, and both were quite good!  They make a good cocktail and have a great happy hour...with a rush, so be aware it can fill up!  People always seem to be happy and having fun here..it's got that fun vibe!  Check it out!"}
{"text":"Our server Charlie was great! Soo informative about the menu and on top of everything. Great relaxing atmosphere and not ridiculously priced. Only problem is parking, like anywhere in old town. Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"I like this bar! The drinks aren't overly sweet and they're strong! The food is awesome, especially the shrimp rolls with a little siracha! The atmosphere is fun and the servers are friendly. Happy hour pricing is awesome. What more could someone ask for? The only thing I would change would be better chairs. These ones aren't comfy. But overall check it out"}
{"text":"Fun casual place. Have been coming for a while and I always get the same thing: Spicy Thai Chicken Bowl and the Hawaiian Ceviche. Check out happy hour days and times!"}
{"text":"Ok, Hula, you got my vote. I just arrived in Scottsdale, and I was hungry for something exciting. The hostess was a little standoffish, so I initially felt that I might have made a mistake walking into this super trendy restaurant that looked so chic and cool - I just wanted something homey! After a comment which was confusingly either a compliment or a statement, she left me to my shaded patio spot and was soon replaced by my server who was an absolute peach! Seriously, she was super great! I ordered a tropical iced tea, which apparently needed a new batch brewing, but she brought me water in the meantime, so I had something to sip on. She quickly took my food order, after giving me a bunch of delicious sounding suggestions - I wasn't super hungry, so I got a single fish taco (one of my favourite things! And always a good test of a place, in my book)   When my food arrived it looked a little fancy, if only because the rice and beans were carefully placed together in a neat circle, not haphazardly smeared everywhere (which, I confess, I kind of love!) but soon proved to be delicious! The fish was super well cooked and tender, and there were two corn tortillas, turning my one taco into two! Hurrah! Needless to say, I ate everything! And the iced tea was yummy too - very refreshing, and I loved the hint of tropical flavour. Hula, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Scottsdale Location  My wife and I are big fans of your Central location, so when your Scottsdale location opened up, we've been anxiously awaiting an opportunity to come in. That occasion came about yesterday, when we brought our two daughters (2 & 3) and my in-laws for dinner.   First, let me start by saying that the kids were relatively well behaved...so I don't think that had any impact on our experience and/or treatment at all.   When we first arrived, we were greeted by a hostess who seemed like she barely had a pulse. She seemed almost annoyed that she had to seat us, instead of warmly greeting us and showing us to our seats (you know...like what a hostess does?). Upon leaving for the evening, she was off talking to some obvious friends who were seated at a nearby table, rather than at her station thanking us for coming in.  Our waitress disappeared for large chunks of time throughout the evening, and we had to ask for more water, a side of dressing (which never arrived), or a second round of drinks (which we didn't order...because she never came back again until she brought the bill). We saw her over by the bar several times throughout the night conversing with one of the bartenders (mind you...it wasn't busy, and nobody appeared to be making any drinks).  Atmosphere was great...and the food of course is delicious...but man, can you guys revisit customer service with your staff? I felt embarrassed for my in-laws, and felt uncomfortable that I put them through that experience."}
{"text":"I highly recommend eating at hula's.  The atmosphere is really hip and it's located in a great part of Scottsdale.  But the best thing is the food. I had the chic bowl that was fabulous. It was really big and the flavors were spicy and chic was super tender. The meal was all that more enjoyable by our awesome and super nice server Skyler.  Thanks for the great service."}
{"text":"We emailed manager in advance about a table reservation for a large party of 24 people for the evening of August 13. We arrived and the group had a great time! It was the perfect vibe to kick off our fun evening. The whole dinner start to finish went smooth and everyone in our group raved about their fantastic meal. The food quality is impressive. Drinks were fun and excellent. Would definitely come again when back in Arizona!"}
{"text":"My friend recommended Hula's as a fun trendy place to go before going to a movie at Scottsdale Fashion Square. Although we had poor communication skills amongst ourselves and I ended up at the Scottsdale location while she went to the Phoenix location, the experience was amazing. Their happy hour menu and prices were so diverse. There were many vegetarian options which was wonderful and their full bar had a ton of drink varieties and specialties. I loved the openness of this restaurant with the outdoor patio option. This location is in a lively part of Old Town Scottsdale and it was really fun to people watch! I got the black bean burger and it was more than filling and I liked having the option of sweet potato fries as well as the regular option!"}
{"text":"I will start by saying our waitress was very nice, she did a good job. BUT the food was not very good. The water tasted really bad and weird. The food was bland. I had fish tacos and my husband had the luau sandwich and they were both just eh. The best thing was the sweet potato fries. Don't waste your time going here."}
{"text":"One might think a Polynesian restaurant in the middle of an old western town would feel out of place...but not so! It's quaint and refreshing. I'm no Hawaiian food connoisseur, but the Mongolian beef bowl was delicious. The pineapple-infused wine...not so much :-/ Order a Mai Tai instead ;)"}
{"text":"Excellent food, great service!! We took our servers recommendation on the spicy edamame and I'm glad we did!!  The Mai Tai's are excellent, not too sweet.  Also ordered the crispy coconut shrimp rolls and the lemongrass mahi, excellent choices."}
{"text":"Came here for the food and had a couple tiki drinks and i was not disappointed. The drinks were awesome they have a really nice  menu and the appetizers were of the hook. We had some tuna tar tar and it was the best we've had. The bar is really cool looking very modern and highly recommend it."}
{"text":"The food was excellent! Even though it says it doesn't cater to kids the waiter was great with our two kids and they loved their food too! Great drinks"}
{"text":"Loved the food, service & atmosphere! Yummy fish tacos, coconut shrimp roll & Mai Tai's!"}
{"text":"Convenient restaurant to grab lunch downtown. I got the Cajun Ahi Tuna Caesar Salad. The salad itself was pretty basic but the tuna was cooked perfectly and had a great spicy cajun taste to it. Also, the tropical ice tea there is delicious and they give free refills.   The service wasn't very attentive but it didn't deter too much from our experience. If I'm ever downtown and looking for a salad I would come back for this one."}
{"text":"The food was pretty bland. If you're looking for authentic Hawaiian food, I wouldn't go here. The service was great but the food wasn't. I love calamari but I had to return my plate at this place."}
{"text":"Incredibly friendly staff for starters! We had an annoying person in our group who ate all her food and then complained that it was gross. Manager accommodated her (and completely kept his cool which I could barely do) and made sure she was happy by the time we left. Our group was a pretty good size and everyone else enjoyed their food and the birthday girl even got some ice cream. I ordered the coconut shrimp rolls and they were on point. Awesome place for celebrating something or just coming in to eat and have drinks."}
{"text":"We had the best service and I ordered the Ahi tacos which I'm very picky about. I've had Ahi all over the USA. The best Ahi tacos I've ever had."}
{"text":"I was so happy when Hula opened up in Scottsdale. I always loved the Phoenix location but did not make it there often enough. The Scottsdale location has a very nice wide open feel and a big bar. Huge doors give a patio feel to everyone when the weather is nice. Food is really good, I love the poke and the luau pork plate. Delicious. I love their MaiTais. Really good and not too sweet. If MaiTais are not your thing there are plenty of other tropical drinks to try. They have some different food and drink specials each night of the week and a solid happy hour. I have been to Hula's five times since they opened and I got great or exceptional service each and every time."}
{"text":"A great place to grab some grub. Every dish we had was delicious. Best time to go is Happy Hour. Portions are very generous."}
{"text":"The Ahi Poke over rice is the bomb.   The ceviche was good but slightly acidic today.  Hang Over Hash and Carnita tacos were very tasty.  The Blood Orange Martini over ice was nice too.  Slow service so don't come here if you are in a hurry.   Just sit back and have a few drinks."}
{"text":"This place is amazing... It's pretty rare to find a restaurant serving Hawaiian cuisine, but this place is way beyond that--it's probably the best Hawaiian restaurant in the country!  The chef masterfully combines tropical flavors with succulent BBQ and the result is something you can't really find anywhere else around.  The atmosphere is super modern and clean, and the music is good.  Everyone's cool and the service is very attentive.  Booyah.  5+ stars!"}
{"text":"We tried Hulu's again and this time had a wonderful experience! It was a quick trip for happy hour which included tasty crispy coconut shrimp rolls, pork tacos, and hula's chicken wings all washed down with a blood orange martini!! A must try again, sooner than later."}
{"text":"My fiance and I have been here twice.  Once was great, and once was fine.  Most recently we sat on the patio, which made for amazing people-watching.  Service the second time we were in was much better than the first time.   Both times we ordered things our servers recommended. We weren't impressed with the Pulled Pork Sandwich, the Spicy Thai Chicken Bowl, the Shrimp Tacos, or the Ahi Sandwich.  We loved the Potstickers, and the Salad that came with the Ahi Sandwich.  The place looks great.  The ambiance is gorgeous.  I hope to check out their mimosa brunch deal ... that sounds affordable and delicious.  Sunday Funday anyone?  Overall this is a fun place, but I would recommend coming here for drinks and skipping dinner."}
{"text":"Finally a long awaited review for Hula's Modern Tiki. I wanted to go several times and try different items before writing this review.    The first time I went I wanted to write a 5 star review. The second time the same thing and finally still the same so I feel pretty confident in giving Hula's 5 stars.   I have never had a bad experience. From the moment you walk in to the moment you walk out.    First of all you are in downtown Scottsdale. Which is great on its own. Second this restaurant has the open concept where it makes you feel like you are inside and outside.  It's airy and during this time of year just beautiful.   The service and the staff are all very friendly and very prompt. The prices are very reasonable and the food is delicious.   I have gotten the bowls several times and have never been disappointed. They are large and will leave you feeling full. The salads are also large. I will also go as far to say that the south sea fish tacos are the best fish tacos I have EVER had. If you try them and don't agree and know of a better place please let me know :).   I could go on and on but Hula's has earned my business and I have recommended it to several people since.   I will be back Hula's."}
{"text":"Great food and great service.  Four entrees, two appetizers two adult drinks and walked out with a bill under $100 with tip for a family of four.  Kali ribs were great as was the calamari and shrimp rolls.  Our second time here except last time we went to the Phoenix location.  Will be our standby."}
{"text":"Great experience! One of our items didn't come out well; not only did they handle it beautifully with a quick and sincere apology, they took it off our bill and also gave us hula bucks for our next trip. The coconut shrimp rolls were fabulous and the wasabi ahi was to die for! Great service as well; manager even came out to make sure we were cool with everything and also to apologize again. I'd definitely come back!"}
{"text":"THIS IS NOT A TIKI BAR FYI, and the hostess was so grouchy we didn't stay for our order. We walked in at around 2:30 and the hostess said \"um this isn't brunch, so we only offer this part of the menu ( waving her hand) is this alriiight with you!??\" We said ya sure confused and we said can we sit near the bar. Her eyes ROLLED back into her head and said sure quickly gathering the menus and utensils pissed off. We finally said \"F*** this\" and said we are outta here! And we said on our way out. \"We'll be back when you have a better attitude! See ya wouldn't wanna be ya!"}
{"text":"Had to update this as I let my emotions get better of me.  This place rocks.  Definitely worth checking out when in Old Town!"}
{"text":"I came here with some friends for Happy Hour this past Friday night. We were immediately impressed with the building and the cool decor. Upon arriving, we were seated immediately and helped by a waiter who was very attentive the rest of the evening.  Between the three us us, we worked our way through a couple rounds of cocktails, chicken skewers, fries, and some entrees. All the drinks we sampled were delicious, if I had one bit of feedback, it's that I wish they were garnished a little more ridiculously, like I would expect at a tiki lounge.   The food was very tasty, the chicken skewers had a delicious sauce on them and the fries were tasty; however, I'd love to see them include some sort of sauce other than ketchup with them. For our entrees my friends ordered the fish tacos and I opted for the ahi tuna bowl. Everything tasted fresh and totally hit the spot. With the great happy hour deals, our evening was a major bang for our buck."}
{"text":"This is such a cute place to get a few drinks and some bites and enjoy a warm evening in downtown Scottsdale. The crowd is mostly younger 20somethings and 30somethings, which is refreshing because it seems to be generally an older crowd that hangs out at nicer places in the downtown area. We really loved sitting outside and enjoying our cocktails. I would definitely go back and try more food :)"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to write this review for a while, but am just now getting around to it! I LOVE THIS PLACE!  Earlier this summer, I decided I wanted to celebrate my birthday here, and had a group of about 20 people. The managers were SO accommodating and easy to work with, even with short notice since my friend had accidentally booked our initial reservation at the PHX location by accident. They responded to my emails and calls very quickly and it washed away any anxiety I was having!  They were so kind to me and made me feel special on my birthday. The waiters are always so kind to me regardless of the occasion as well. The food and drinks are so delicious and unique, so it really does make it an all around great experience. I love the happy hour menu too, and getting texts to my phone about the secret deals.  During the cooler months too, they also open the large doors in front too, which is nice to have the fresh air. The only hard thing can be parking since it's old town, but fortunately, I've always been able to snag a spot in their lot.  Thank you for being one of my favorite restaurants in town!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Food is great, no the typical old town crowd which is nice. Bartender is great and prices and unbeatable. Love coming here with my GF!!  Cajun burger is great and the ahi tacos"}
{"text":"Finally back to try some food and had good results on a recent weekend evening. I don't eat fish tacos, but these were reported to be the best ever. My HULU burger was 11 bucks and had that Hulu sauce, which isn't that impressive enough to be doused on my burger. The burger in general was a good slab of meat on a soft roll with some grilled onions. Side Dishes dragged the rating down. Sweet Potato Fries - limp, not good Rice - Overcooked, clumpy, unknown white sauce HULU sauce - very bland, needs a new recipe with a Hawaiian twist,  The Drinks at 7 bucks each were tasty. Dr. Funk was a good choice. They had one TV set on the ASU game, but none of the 30 people (except me) were watching. Ok, it's not a sports bar, but a decent time. Although I wonder why the burger costs $2 more at dinner when nothing on that burger has changed except the time of day it was served."}
{"text":"We absolutely loved Hulas! HIGHLY recommend.  First off, we decided to order take-out on a Saturday night, and the process of simple, easy and quick. There were, however, plenty seats available if we wanted to eat there.  Second, I needed the meal to be gluten-free, so I actually emailed the restaurant in advance asking for their gluten-free menu. The owner, Dana, was so wonderful and responded immediately. He sent me their gluten-free menu, which had TONS of options. Typically, if you need to eat gluten-free due to food allergies, you have a very limited menu to choose from, and none of them are exciting.  This was not the case. I had plenty of things to choose from and ordered the plate that came with pulled pork, white rice, plantains, mango salsa and they even subbed an extra scoop of rice instead of the cornbread that came with it that wasn't gluten-free.  We have an amazing experience and I can't wait to eat my leftovers today."}
{"text":"Great variety of food beautifully prepared and reasonably priced.  The fish bites appetizer was a big hit at the table.  I did the steak sandwich and Caesar salad.  It did not have that much meat, but it was tasty (maybe the bread was too big...). My wife's Baja fish tacos were almost to pretty to eat.  Almost... the fist tacos are defiantly worth trying.    Their are dozens of places competing for business in old town and this place is a winner."}
{"text":"After having a bad experience at a restaurant nearby, we decided to give this restaurant a try. We were pleasantly surprised and happy we didn't give the previous establishment our money!! We ordered the potstickers, fried bananas, steak tacos, ahi tuna, short ribs and a few glasses of wine/martinis - all were full of flavor and nothing was left. Customer service was great and they made sure our 21 month old son was satisfied with the food they prepared. Thanks for a great dinner!!"}
{"text":"We went to Hula's for a company happy hour and it was AMAZING! So much yummy food and the beers on tap are from Hawaii and Maui  I will be going back for sure"}
{"text":"This is a pretty great place. the atmosphere is nice and chill, the staff is super friendly but the food is really why I go there! I've had the mango chicken caesar, one of the lunch \"bowls\" and both are really good. Best on the menu are the Tacos! I've had the shrimp, fish and chicken and all three are phenomenal! Great Place!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, great service, the bar is amazing. Martinis are their speciality. Perfectly made. At the Scottsdale location ask for Sierra, best cocktails and amazing service!"}
{"text":"Friendly service. Upbeat atmosphere. Good Value on great food. Nice variety of quality food and drink.    Very caring and involved management.   Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Great place to grab drinks and a quick bite.  I had the pineapple wine and it was better than expected.  In fact I would come back for the wine alone.  My wife and I also had the south seas fish tacos. Amazing! They were delicious.  They even split the dish without asking. Also, they weren't fried. They were grilled to perfection. Threw some chalula on it and they were perfect."}
{"text":"We love all things Hawaiian, so for happy hour on a weekday we nipped right into Hula's for drinks and dinner.  Since the tiki theme seemed to lend itself more to the bar side, I expected good drinks and was not disappointed (plus happy hour prices all night on Wed!).  I love a good Mai Tai and Hula's made one that could stand proud even in Honolulu.  Not the best I ever had, but by far the best I ever had on the mainland.  They had several of the Kona brewing beers and my wife had the Fire Rock Pale Ale, which is always good.  So drinks taken care of, we began to peruse the food listings.  My wife had Duke's Roast Pork entree and I had an entree of Seared Ahi with Jerk sauce.  Both were large servings and quite tasty.  The roast pork was pulled in a mound on the center of the plate with rice on one side and slaw on the other.  The ahi was cooked medium, the jerk sauce was darker than a traditional Jamaican jerk but made a nice accompaniment.  The dish also included a couple of cooked plantains (yummy) and a couple of squares of a nut bread of some sort (tasty), plus a mound of rice.  Very satisfying.  We love key lime pie, so we decided to try it even though we were pretty full.  The pie was 4 inches high and a nice sized wedge, with probably an inch of the key lime filling and the rest whipped cream with graham cracker crust.  We managed to finish the key lime part but left a bit of whipped cream and crust.  The restaurant has a bright airy feel to it and the tiki themed decorations were fun.  It was a very pleasant reminder of trips to the islands and I recommend you try it for drinks and food."}
{"text":"Food was soso at best, pulled pork was bland and watery, probably done in a crockpot.  Bloody Mary was spicy but fairly tasteless. Waitress was very attentive. Hard to call it tiki, so tiki's on the wall, and some fruity drinks on the menu, but no tropical music, no Hawaiian shirts. Nothing to set it apart."}
{"text":"The service could not have been better and the food was awesome.  The signature Hula burger was perfectly cooked to order with lovely grilled onions, fresh lettuce and tomato offered on the side. Get half sweet potato half regular fries!  A tropical iced tea topped off a perfect lunch experience."}
{"text":"Most delicious meal in Old Town! We enjoyed great service, a nice view of the patio, and sipped on Mai Tais which were delicious! The habanero lime chicken tacos were divine and the chicken sandwich was very tasty topped with pineapple and pesto. It's a must stop!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere, great style, very neo-tiki. I love tiki, so the more the merrier, especially in AZ.  Apps are good, had some bomb sweet potato fries, the entrees are also pretty big, hungry big. Which is nice considering the tiny portions you get at most places.  A sweet place to load up on food and visuals, relax, enjoy yourself, and feel like you're not in Arizona anymore, but in a cool modern cafe in LA by the beach."}
{"text":"Hulas has a large menu with something for everyone! Items range from tacos to jerk chicken to fresh fish off the grill. Everything looked so amazing that I took 20 minutes to decided what I wanted!  Landed on the ceviche appetizer - this was so delicious! White fish perfectly marinated with a coconut twist. It had the perfect amount of peppers and onions too. Served with wontons to scoop it all up!   Thai chicken bowl - chicken breast with a creamy thai sauce, served with perfectly cooked rice and beans. The portion was huge and the cabbage and Avocado were a nice touch.   Great selection of Hawaiian beer and wine as well. I had the pineapple wine - never tried it before and it was excelled.   Service was speedy at the bar!"}
{"text":"My guy and I were visiting a relative in Scottsdale, and I researched for a good week, looking for a place to have a bite to eat as well as good cocktails. After searching on Yelp for others' opinions, I found this place (originally only knowing about the Phoenix location, but luckily spotted their Scottsdale location). We were there around 8pm, and were seated quickly. The place is smaller than I expected, but wasn't too crowded. We were seated promptly, and made our drink orders. The food was good, as well as the drinks. Service was spot on. I plan to stop by this place whenever we're in town visiting again."}
{"text":"Great place for drinks and Aps. But as for food, ehh. Never blows my mind. Shrimp rolls are constantly good."}
{"text":"WOW!!!! Everything my friends & I ordered was amazingly delicious!!! We ordered 3 appetizers highly recommend the edamame which they cooked it with a delicious spices!! The Thai chicken bowl was incredible & calamari sandwich is a MUST have. The mai Thai is on point!! This place is a must go to place!!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent. I had the Luau Pork sandwich w a side of plantains. It was very delicious, the pork very tender and juicy w a sweet after taste to it. Drinks were delicious. Waitress, unfortunately was rude and short with us all. Rudely told my mother in law to \"hold on, sweetheart\" while she was trying to give her the order and said, \"just give me a minute, okay\"  when we asked for ketchup. She never brought a second drink for someone at the table, and she collected all the plates while someone was still eating. I'd like to give 5 stars but the waitress was not  Update: I received an email from the owner of this restaurant apologizing for the service and explaining the waitress must of had a bad day, which we all have now and then. The attentiveness to their customers and the quality of the food has definitely earned them all 5 Stars. The food was very delicious and the marriage flavors were impeccable. I've eaten many similar sandwiches in my travels and having worked closely with an executive Chef at one of the top 15 guest ranches in the world, I have to say this one was by far my favorite. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Fun and entertaining place for dinner on a Saturday night. Dining area and bar are close to each that you can see the game playing on the Bar TV. Music is loud enough to be heard all over the restaurant.  No reservations but plenty of tables after 8pm on a Saturday.  Hostess and waitress extremely nice and helpful. Ordered the Hawaii Five-O cocktail, on the sweet side and refreshing on a hot Arizona day!    Ordered the Bali Hai ribs, half rack. Not into cole slaw and was able to order extra sweet potato fries. Food was room temperature not warm or hot like it just came out of the oven or grill. Ribs was flavorful and BBQ sauce was on the sweet side. Wife ordered the jawaiian jerk chicken. Bit of a kick on the chicken but wife enjoyed her food.  If you are looking for a fun entertaining place on a Saturday night that serves Hawaiian food, this is your place!"}
{"text":"I love me a tiki bar, so I couldn't wait to make our way to this place while we were visiting Scottsdale.  I have to say, it doesn't really deliver as a 'tiki bar,' so keep that in mind if you're looking for the old school kitschy type tiki lounge.  It's really a restaurant with a couple of tiki type pictures.  So after my initial disappointment about that, we got down to the business of ordering drinks and food. The drinks were pretty much what you would expect; pricey, tropical, and packed a punch.  The food was much better than your typical bar fare.  We weren't there in time for happy hour, but the HH prices and selection looked like a good deal.  The service was great as well.  I'd love to see them tiki the place up a bit and it would be perfect!"}
{"text":"If you like tiki modern Hawaiian then give it a whirl. Our experience was fun and everything we ordered was on point. Waitress was great, lots of attention to ensure our table had everything we ordered."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favorite places in the Scottsdale area. The service was very good. The interior of the restaurant was clean, simple, and elegant. It was also very family friendly. Most importantly, te food was delicious. Very delicious."}
{"text":"It's definitely modern, it isn't some old school joint. It's definitely decked out with tiki designs like you're on some fantasy island. And they definitely serve fusion islander food.  They served some fusion Thai food, fusion Hawaiian dish, and a lot of other fusion islander dishes you could think of.  When in Scottsdale, fresh food with an ideal islander dish to eat, then this is the place to be.  Their tofu mango taco was delicious. Although I wish the tofu wasn't too bland.  What's islander about this? Well the mango. It's a tropical fruit. My fiancé ordered some Thai inspired dish.  It had some kick of spice and added flavor like the avocado and coconut sauce.  What's so islander about this? Well, the avocado and coconut.  I gave this place a 4 star because it's well presented and tasted fresh. I also give them a star for an effort to create a modern islander fusion restaurant. My review should be approved coming from someone who is born and raised on an island called Hawaii!"}
{"text":"Amazing food with affordable price. Great service as well. They cook everything very well except the rice. It was quite a disappointment about the rice because anything else was awesome. If they fix this problem, would give 5 star definitely."}
{"text":"Hulu wow pork tacos! Well done. And fantastic Mai Thai !!!!!!!! Food was amazing very pleasantly surprised will be back. Only thing holding back from 5 is the decor is a little lacking for a \"50\"s style tiki bar but overall thumbs up Hulu Scottsdale I salute you!"}
{"text":"Tiki bars evoke dated kitsch, but this Old Town Scottsdale establishment is anything but. In addition to the cool, modern ambiance, the menu offers a plethora of Hawaiian-inspired dishes with a focus on fish. A ceviche starter, for instance, delivered fresh-tasting whitefish with a pleasant citrus tang. For the land lubbers among ye, the pork dishes are also well-executed. The jerk pork is a departure from  the classic Caribbean preparation (it's a bit sweeter) but no less tasty, and purists can still rejoice at the presence of plantains.   Pricing here is reasonable (entrees in the teens), the menu is sufficiently varied, service is friendly and prompt, but there is one significant drawback: the music can be ear-splittingly loud. Catch a break in between songs, however, and you can enjoy a flavorful meal."}
{"text":"We enjoyed a late lunch on a weekday.  As we sat, the waiter made sure we knew that dinner entrees were not available. Lunch entrees were satisfactory. I had a squid sandwich: it was substantial. One friend had a chicken sandwich which he enjoyed. The other had a dish of rice and hamburger patty which could have had egg on it.  My wife had shrimp tacos. We split a side of sweet potato fries.  We were all happy with our lunch. Each couple split a coconut cream pie dessert. My wife and I had tropical drinks which were pretty good. Everything was reasonably priced.  Service was excellent. Of course, when there are only four tables in use (not counting some day drinkers), a waiter can handle things. In any case we were all pleased we tried this place.  It was recommended by a friend's son and it was a good recommendation.  Unfortunately, the music in the background was a little loud and somewhat obnoxious."}
{"text":"Loved, loved it... the food was awesome and service gr8... I feel water bad for not asking the server's name... he was prompt, gave us enough time, filled our glasses, was on top of his game and did not miss a smile... food was just perfect... have my in laws visiting from abroad and they loved it and the Cajun burger- was oh so delicious! Definitely will be going back again"}
{"text":"I have been DYING to try Hula's for the longest time, so when we needed a lunch spot in Old Town Scottsdale, I jumped on the chance!   The service was a tad slow to start but once the ball got rolling, everything was delicious. I ordered a tropical iced tea and the Spicy Thai Chicken Bowl {not really \"hot\" spicy, just yummy spices!} and it was packed with rice, black beans, avocado, cabbage, and fried sweet plantains. It was so good, I didn't want it to end. Also, the portion was HUGE, I definitely couldn't eat it all! 3 of my family members ordered their black bean burger and said it was so delicious. Their hand-cut fries and macaroni salad were also very yum! We will be back again for sure, i'd love to try dinner! I also hear they have a great happy hour from 3:30p-6 PM on weekdays and all night on Wednesdays. Sign me up!   Thanks for a tasty experience, Hula's!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place more stars I would! I'll start with our exceptional service! We were here a few  a few months ago when my husband was interviewing, since then, we have moved here and rave about this place every chance we get. Tonight's experience was on par! The staff is always, always friendly! I have gotten the bowls here in the past  they are delicious and very filling! We started with the Crunchy shrimp roll and spicy fish cakes. Both were great starters. I love the mango purée sauce that comes with the shrimp rolls! Tonight I got the kalbi rib. They were cooked just right and full of flavor! My husband got the pork tacos which were cooked and seasoned to perfection! Our friend got the jawaiian pork plate- it was tender and had a nice kick. You can't leave here until you've had their key lime pie! Perfect combo of tart and sweet. It was a drive, but worth it. Tyler took great care of us. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Hesitantly went here on a first drink date, why was I hesitant? Scottsdale is intimidating for small town native Tucson folk. The open patio mixed with a theme is something I previously associated with \"high prices\" and \"attitude.\"    Our bartender, was a friendly gal with some insight to the cocktails, a very classy lip ring and tasteful tattoos (not sure of the relevance here, but it definitely made me consider getting one or two). I work as a mixologist and bartender in the next town down and I have to say, I was very impressed with her knowledge, positive attitude and overall attentiveness.   Coming from a small town, a large city and just wanting some interesting cocktails and friendly vibes? Well I can't vouch for the food, but the drinks and the service will definitely bring us back."}
{"text":"We love the food and the atmosphere here.  We just ordered appetizers this time, 5 of them and they were all yummy.  The crispy pot stickers are the bomb!"}
{"text":"Last night was our first time to visit Hula's. We love Hawaii and Hawaiian food so it seemed like a great choice. My wife and I shared the Lobster bisque and the coconut shrimp rolls. These were the highlights of our meals, especially the bisque. It is a bit spicy and a little different from a traditional bisque, but I would definitely order this again. For entrees my wife had the coconut encrusted Hapu and I had the ribs.  Both were good, but not spectacular. Her Hapu had way too much sauce on it, but once she scraped off most of the sauce it was good.   The one big negative was the noise level. It was very loud and made worse by a very obnoxious group at the bar who had obviously already had many drinks. We wanted desert but the yelling from the bar area made it very hard to enjoy our meal. I don't know if this is typical. I would go there again, but if the noise level was a loud as it was when we went, I wouldn't return again. Too bad, good food and a fun vibe."}
{"text":"Best mai tai ever. I don't like them sweet and their's was delicious. Really shocked when we got the bill and they were only five dollars each on a Sunday. The food around us looked delicious but we did not eat."}
{"text":"Call me a woman of simple taste, but their coconut rice topped with black beans is a total surprise party with glitter bombs all over my tastebuds! It came as a side with one of their fish taco choices. The fish tacos were as expected but really the coconut rice and black beans should be a main dish. Like seriously.   Now that we've got that out of the way, let's talk about the rest of this restaurant. It's really swanky-trendy-cool in here. Literally what you think in your mind when you think tiki lounge with a modern twist. So they've got that right!   Lots of choices and flavors, got that right too! Great drinks, yup, that too! We decided to go with their Tuesday deal, 2 appetizers and 2 cocktails for $20, plus a couple extra appetizers since we were all sharing.The ceviche and poke were the standouts, in my opinion and I really loved my blood orange martini!   Above all, their service was great! Everyone from the host to the multiple people that helped us out were incredible! There were a couple spills at the table next to us and instead of getting too over excited or frustrated the staff just seamlessly helped them clean it all up. It was awesome! I've had to work as a server/host so I definitely know how it is with drinks/hot food/birthdays/big groups. It can be a mess sometimes, but this place handles it soooo well!   My only regret is that I didn't order a drink that came in one of their cute tiki cups!"}
{"text":"I was so happy when they announced they were opening a location in Scottsdale.  This is a really fun place and I am sure it will be a hit in the area.  There are a couple of kinks still to work out, but I am sure they will take care of it.  We went for the grand opening, we sat at a communal table with several friends.  I was having such a fun time that I missed the ribbon cutting ceremony.  My first drink was the Dr. Funk, very fruity and rummy.  I think it could be dangerous, because I was downing it pretty fast.  My second one was the One Eye Pyrat, I love ginger beer, so I wanted to try it.  That one was good, but I liked my first drink better. To eat we had the Ahi Tuna Wontons, Pork Tacos and Johnny cakes.  Everything was really good.  We never got our sweet potato fries, but they took them off the bill.  It was a pretty confusing table, so I don't blame our server Charlie, he was trying to take care of a table of over 12 people.  I already know what I am getting next, can't wait to be back."}
{"text":"Prompt and friendly service. Came in on a whim and really enjoyed our experience. We got the sliders appetizers and two types of tacos. I would have preferred a different side since the black beans and white rice were pretty bland. But overall, good food, nice people, reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to expect with this Hula's, but after attending their grand opening I was pleasantly surprised.  Despite being extremely busy, we had great service and food. I tried the house made vegetarian black bean burger with sweet potato fries. It was excellent and big enough to feed at least 2 people! The only thing I wasn't thrilled with was their drinks were premixed.  The Mai Tai was a little sweet for my taste, so I asked them to take down the pineapple juice a bit, but they couldn't...so I moved on to  a dark and stormy.   We're looking forward to returning for Sunday brunch and all day happy hour... let's just say Hula's is going to be packed this spring!"}
{"text":"A little taste of the islands in the desert! The cocktails are great here. The only thing missing is be salty ocean breeze. This time I had the shrimp tacos and my husband had the Ahi bowl. Both were delicious. Will definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"My barber couldn't squeeze me in until 2:30 pm and since it was close to lunch time, I made the executive decision to explore Old Town Scottsdale.    Out comes my Yelp app, close by was a ton of interesting options.  Hula's Modern Tiki caught my attention and within three minutes, I was parking in their off-street lot (nice!).  Nice vibe and very helpful staff.  They had the front completely open and I chose to sit out there.  The hostess noticed the table needed to be wiped down and ran to get a dish rag, much appreciated.  Menu is fairly deep but I was fixated (as always) on the tacos.  I choose two, the sweet pork and the habanero lime tacos.  Both were bursting with flavor.  The pork was delicious, some of the best I've had and I make this at home a lot!  The habanero lime tacos were excellent, really not spicy so I'm not sure they're named correctly but still the flavor profiles were fantastic.  Had iced tea and it was excellent, very good and my server kept it full.  Overall, I'll go back and take the Princess along (she wasn't happy I went without her).  Great food and service."}
{"text":"A friend and I came in on a Thursday night around 11 hoping to get a late night bite and check out Hula's Modern Tiki (formally Big Earls BBQ). Upon arriving  we were informed the kitchen was partially open due to the late hour and would not be able to prepare select items on the menu. Not really too hungry we were fine with the limited selection. The special on Thursday nights features a word of the day you can access through Facebook that grants you 2-4-1 drinks. We decided to try out their Hula Mai-Tai which is a stronger, less sweet twist on the traditional cocktail. It was the perfect balance of rum and tart citrus.    We then started with the white fish ceviche, which was light and delicious. The accompanied wontons provided the perfect amount of crunch. We scarfed the plate down in a matter of minutes, which was followed by our ahi tuna tacos. They were a bit on the spicy side for my own preference, but were pulled together nicely by their rice and beans which cooled the dish down a little, the ahi wasn't incredible but by far not the worse.   For being as late as it was I was happy with the attentiveness of our server and the overall ambiance of the restaurant. My date was on shazam the whole course of our dinner looking up long lost songs she had forgotten over the years.   Overall, I enjoyed my dinning experience at Hula's and am eager to come back earlier in the night to try other entrees that I missed out on ( the ribs!!! ). There is definite potential and the fun, laid back atmosphere accompanied by a extensive tropical drink menu will lead to a successful addition to Old Town."}
{"text":"Good chow and nice ambiance. Took my mother there for lunch and they created a chocolate martini for her."}
{"text":"Thought I would give the Hula another try. Had the pork sandwich with coleslaw. Short story is the pork was tough as leather and hard to chew. The Mai Tai was a little on the lite side and tart side as well. The server was nice, but after the food was delivered to the table, he disappeared. Can't say that Hula will be a return visit, but who knows."}
{"text":"Glad that I found this place  Great food! Loco Moco delicious! Great service and very clean."}
{"text":"What a great meal.  Visiting from out of town, looked to YELP for help with a dinner recommendation.  Found Hula's on YELP, we were happy with everything!  Party of 6, no reservations, but we got the last table on a lively Friday night.  LEE was our server - efficient, accurate, and easy going.  Appetizers were great...coconut shrimp rolls & crispy fish bites.  I had been craving a luau style kalua pork. Although their sandwich was good, it wasn't quite what I had in mind.  Didn't stop me from eating it though!  We all ate up all of our meals.  I hope to go back again!"}
{"text":"Cool place. Love the open air dining. Jackie the bartender is awesome. It's my first time here, and she is the best!  Welcoming.  The Ahi tacos are great (bartender recommended). Enjoy!!!!"}
{"text":"We've been to the California Hula's locations and here once before. Food and service tonight was great. Tara, our server, was super friendly and took great care of us. We ordered apps (calamari and ceviche) and dinner (burger, jawaiian jerk pork, dukes luau) well as a shared dessert (yummy key lime pie) and coffee. Everything but the calamari was delicious. Really no complaints though.   The restaurant wasn't crowded which is too bad because the whole experience and he price/value was good.   Definitely will be back and recommend it!!"}
{"text":"Nothing special to say for or against this place.  Price was on par with where it was (a little expensive - scottsdale), food was ok, service was ok.  Nice atmosphere and it does seem to be baby friendly as we had our 9 month old and others had babies too.    Didn't get the \"Tiki\" part, didn't seem to overly islandish."}
{"text":"We are from out of town and don't have a restaurant like this in Indiana, so I was pretty stoked to try it. Based on the reviews, I thought it was a sure bet. Most people recommended the coconut shrimp rolls and spicy Thai chicken bowl. We ordered the shrimp rolls, the chicken bowl, a side of macaroni salad, and the snapper cook blackened wasabi style. The shrimp rolls were superb, but the main dishes were not good at all. The fish was dry and hard, and we sent it back. The spicy Thai chicken bowl had a sliced chicken breast on top with a strange sauce. I ate two bites and left the rest. The Mac salad totally lacked mayo and salt, and the noodles were undercooked. The waiter didn't inquire why my whole entree was still sitting there at the conclusion of our meal. It was basically $50 wasted. Maybe it was an off night for their chef, but based on what we were served, I wouldn't recommend dining here. I will say that the atmosphere of the restaurant was very nice, so I would probably recommend  just getting the shrimp rolls and cocktail if you do try it out."}
{"text":"Very cool menu and concept, but we will not be coming back here. The table felt like we were st s cafeteria- very small, up against a wall, cheap plastic table and chairs. Service was quick but our food came within 5 minutes of receiving our drink orders, making us feel rushed and like we couldn't sit and enjoy our drink. I got the luau pork plate which I mostly enjoyed- the sauce was delicious, and I really liked the rice and cole slaw, but the pork itself was a little stringy. My husband ordered the jerk chicken and it was INEDIBLE. The consistency was almost nauseating to him, like puréed chicken, and he has at least 5 bones in the dish. My husband is an Army vet, so he can stomach a lot of textures of food, but he looked like he was going to get sick eating it. The flavor of the jerk itself, though, was very good.   2 stars for quality of food and atmosphere. We came on a Monday night, so they might not have brought their A game as they would on a weekend."}
{"text":"I have been to the Central Phoenix Hula's location many times, but this was my first visit to the Scottsdale outpost.  I brought a large group for lunch and everyone enjoyed their meal.  I was especially pleased with my black bean burger with mac salad - so tasty!  Great atmosphere, great service and great food too!"}
{"text":"Never the less a great spot to visit ,  we always take out of towners here for an enjoyable experience with well thought out Polynesian cuisine . And I can't get over what great service they have! We always sit at the bar so can't speak for the servers but the bartenders truly Make us feel welcome. Max and Dan are wonderful, and warming."}
{"text":"Awesome place and great food!  We were temporarily in Scottsdale for 3 months and tried not to go to the same restaurant twice.  However, we'd never been here before and ended up going here probably 5 times for food or drinks.    They mix fun drinks in Tiki cups if you're into that sort of thing.  They also have a big drink that they put booze in the middle of and light it on fire for a fun effect for groups.  It's great like most awesome places in Scottsdale that the front is open, which is a nice vibe as well.  There were also a few TVs at the bar if you're into sports.  It's a great mix of restaurant and bar atmosphere in my opinion.    What stood out for me food wise was the Mongolian beef dish and I had to fight off others from tasting too may samples becuase it was so delicious.  This will always be a good spot for food and/or drinks when I'm in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"You might not expect to find a hip, Hawaiian-fusion tiki bar next to the souvenir shops in Old Town, but you'll be very glad you stumbled in.  A small place with only a few tables and booths, Hula's Modern Tiki adds a bit of kitsch and a ton of flavour to a Hawaiian inspired menu.  Their white fish ceviche had a clean, crisp flavour, though the wonton chips served along side made scooping a bit of a challenge.  The entrees packed serious flavour, from the soy-and-pineapple infused shredded Luau pork to the kick of the 'Jawaiian Jerk Pork', served with a sweet johnnycake on the side. The fish, in particular, was super-fresh and bursting with flavour. The ahi, served seared and just rare, provided an excellent base for a macadamia crust and hot mango and papaya salsa.  Anyone looking for something new in Scottsdale should look into Hula's."}
{"text":"My Old Town Scottsdale bar hop was supposed to be over.  I was just at my limit and was ready to get back to the hotel but then wait - what is that???  A tiki bar???  Well I am a sucker for a tiki bar so I decided to extended the bar hop to another drink, which turned into many, which turned into too many!!!    From what I remember.....   it was a very unexpected find in old town.  A very strange choice/location/interior but I loved it!  The drinks were so good, as I said, I many have enjoyed them a bit too much.  I really do remember that every one on the menu looked great and each one I ordered was amazing.  Would love to go back again some day, this time at the start of a bar hop instead of the end.  If you are into tiki bars or looking for something different in old town you should check it out."}
{"text":"Thank you to the manager at Hula's for fitting my large party in the week of an event when another restaurant cancelled on us for no reason. The food is excellent and large portions, the drinks are fun and delicious and your location couldn't be better. We love this place and will be back as often as possible!"}
{"text":"Visited for the second time in two years.  This visit was better than the first.  We sat outside ( a little close to the street, but always nice to be outside).  Our waitress, Tara, was great.  She gave us recommendations that were outstanding.    We started with the Fish Bites and then my husband and each had the Hapu fish for entrees.  Mine was macedamian crusted and my husband had the Jerk version.  Each was served with appropriate side and we loved them both.  Would highly recommend for something different in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Love the location, love the people watching, but mostly I just adore the Modern Tiki Fish Sandwich. It is my favorite menu item."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. . Love living in Scottsdale. Food looks amazing. . Here only for drinks. . ."}
{"text":"Drinks were good.   Mai Tai is different, but they tell you that.   Painkiller was our favorite - get the dark rum float.    Hurricane was good too.  Food was ok.  We tried Baka fish tacos - nice portion size and tasty.  Coconut shrimp rolls not so good.  Sauce was way too sweet.  Weird that their TV is not HD??  New place and you can't spring for HD??   Come on owners!!!"}
{"text":"Wow! Amazing food! Amazing cocktails! Great service and I think I tasted the best appetizer of all time: fish bites were so light so crispy but juicy and perfectly prepared! Heaven! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"My family and I had a surreally phenomenal experience dining here recently.  For one, our waitress was perfectly attentive (lots and lots of Diet Coke refills for our party). Other members of the staff were also very pleasent and eager to get rid of plates and the like. The vegetarian options didn't feel like an afterthought and were excellent. They were very accommodating in splitting a delicious black bean burger and a tofu bowl between two of us.  I would recommend the special weekend dessert brownie. Great portions for the price. Fun atmosphere. Couldn't have been a better experience."}
{"text":"Pretty cool little place! Decided to stop here for girls night, we didn't have a reservation and had to wait about 20-25 minutes before we could get seated. Again, not a big deal since we didn't have a reservation on a Friday night.   The menu has a great selection to choose from. I decided that evening to try the Duke's Luau Pork Plate, it was really good, the pork was at least...the slaw, not so much. I also ordered for the table Jamaican Johnny Cakes, though the side was only $3.00, I suggest you keep your money in your wallet. Very bland. No butter, or honey or anything to put on top of it, so we just left those bad boys on the plate after trying them.  Like the other reviews said, you won't find a ton of Hawaiian themed items throughout the restaurant.....hence the modern in the restaurants name but still a hip place to go and have a little Hawaiian infused meal."}
{"text":"Ok...I seriously LOVE this restaurant. The food is delicious and the service is good. Unfortunately, I can't stand the chairs! The chairs are super uncomfortable and leave marks on your legs if you are wearing shorts or a dress. My husband and I still order take out from Hula's, but we won't eat at the restaurant."}
{"text":"Hula's is an awesome Hawaiian gem in the middle of old town Scottsdale! We ordered the scorpion bowl drink which was REALLY strong... so caution to those who don't like 151! The presentation was really cool, it lights up. We ordered the coconut shrimp rolls for appetizer which were okay, I don't think I'd order them again. I ordered the Baja fish tacos and my fiancé ordered kalbi ribs AND OMG his ribs were phenomenal !!!! Great flavor and huge portions and not overpriced. The sweet plantains are also amazing ! Overall this place is great. Will come back again for sure!"}
{"text":"Hulas is a solid option if you are in the Old Town area. I love the tiki bar concept and their amazing Polynesian cocktails. Be aware these are strong drinks. I sat at the bar and Hulas does not skimp on their pours. Service at the bar was friendly and prompt.   The menu is amazing and it took me a while to decide. I was using Yelp mobile and reading all the reviews and each \"you have to try this App or entrée\" review just added to my indecision. I finally decided to order the Ahi tuna tacos and they were seared perfect, spicy, and served on a bed of coleslaw. A side of rice accompanied my tacos. I would highly recommend Hulas for their cocktails, Apps, and entrees. Lastly they have a great extended happy hour. I believe they have daily speciasl as well."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for tacos and this place delivered! We were just walking around Scottsdale and ran into this place and thought why not? Glad we did. I had the shrimp tacos which were SO good and my husband got one chicken and one fish. He liked them both. Our bartender was super great too. Fun to talk to and gave us a couple suggestions. Try this place out if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 3 stars solely based on the attentive staff and decor. Of the food we sampled, I had the lobster bisque soup and the only reason I got it was to see how the flavor of coconut milk blended. It was nice, but subtle so some restraint was shown there, which is appreciated. We got the edamame, which surprisingly was the best menu item and welcomed surprise. I had the Mongolian beef skewers, and something tasted gummy, and at fort I thought it was the dipping sauce but turns out it was the beef. My husband had some kabi (or something like spelled like that) beef ribs. Turns out the were not actually ribs, but riblets and they were tough. All in all, not a place I'd go back to, but then again I'm just a tourist passing by from Miami.    UPDATE on 5/17/2017 I'm updating to a four stars, because management reached out to me, promptly and informed me that Kalbi ribs are supposed to be like that. Like I said, what do I know? Lol. Also, although we didn't ask not to pay, it was nice that management stated we shouldn't have been charged for something we didn't like. And that's much appreciated."}
{"text":"Wow what a great place for something different then standard bar food and burgers. Fantastic drinks, (enjoyed a Dr. Funk and a Painkiller) along with a nice variety of Hawaiian/Polynesian fare. The short ribs were amazing and the Hawaiian Chicken with the sweet pot fries was equally exquisite. Going back for more."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere - healthy menu - good vibe to eat and drink .. Friendly staff .  Suggestion : Need to serve beer in frosted glass ..  Nice out door sides walk tables .."}
{"text":"BOMB!!   Okay, I usually go into more detail but it's not necessary, you just need to go try it out for yourself. Great food, good prices, nice portions, knowledgable staff, and cool ambiance!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh. My new favorite restaurant in Scottsdale! Incredible food and cocktails. The jerk chicken plate was amazing and the spicy edamame and coconut shrimp rolls were to die for."}
{"text":"I still love Hula's!  Came here for a celebration and the food & drinks are still good. This time I had the fish balls, pot sticker & egg roll filled with seafood. They were all delicious!  I had hot tea tonight. I liked how they brought over a selection of hot tea for me to choose & also brought over an extra pot of hot water in case I wanted refills.  The atmosphere & wait staff are consistently friendly and warm.  The place was thriving & hopping even with the rain outside & on a Sunday evening.  This is a good sign that it's a favorite spot for many!"}
{"text":"My mum & i go almost every weekend.... She is in love with their Ceviche & their Chicken Mango Salad as is it is very blackened and has a little kick.... I love any of their tacos, the tofu, the chicken, the shrimp are all flavorful & tasty...Consistent food and great, fun, friendly service will keep us going back!!!"}
{"text":"The Polynesian chicken sandwich was really tasty! The sweet potatoes fries were a little softer then I usually desire. They were extremely accommodating to my mothers food restrictions, offering to prepare the bowls in an entirely different way/sauce then usual. The pink bikini martini was also a really nice drink! The music was a little loud."}
{"text":"Went there last night and got the  Big sur black bean burger and it was amazing!  Went very well with the sweet potato fries they had!   Well worth the try and the staff was great!!"}
{"text":"The food was okay but definitely did not capture the taste of the islands. Looks like a great place for drinks during happy hour but the food won't bring me back."}
{"text":"Check this place out for an awesome happy hour. The ceviche & poke are awesome - fresh as can be! They have great drinks and the happy hour prices are icing on the cake!"}
{"text":"I went here on a first date. The food was ok. My appetizer was a little too fishy for my taste. However the service was unbeatable. It was a very crowded Friday evening and in spite of the crowd, our waiter was very attentive to our needs."}
{"text":"I am really impressed with the restaurant's management on following up on my review on Yelp timely. Like other good restaurants and companies, Hula's used the review to immediately ensure their food handling protocol were being followed. The restaurant definitely have great servers and great dishes. I'm positive my last visit was an anomaly. My family and I will definitely go back in the near future."}
{"text":"Very open airy place right in old town scottsdale.  Had happy hour....Drinks, food and service were good.. it wasn't busy at all, although it was a Sunday."}
{"text":"Great new location in Old Town, I love Hula's and its retro modern environment. Service is friendly and the food has a great Hawaiian/Polynesian fusion twist. Hula's has a great bar and slight outdoor patio for the nice warm days in Scottsdale. Don't forget about the fabulous drinks - when my friends and I are feeling daring we go for the Scorpion bowl. Long colorful straws in a decorative bowl (with a flame) mixed with good company is always a winner. :)  There is a brunch available at Hulas on the weekend, which I have had several times with a couple mimosas and very tasteful.   Like I said earlier, this place has the perfect location and environment for an enjoyable and delicious meal in Old Town! Perfect walking distance from local shops and stadiums if you're here during Spring Training!"}
{"text":"Enjoying dinner with my family. ..food was Amazing. .Service was Excellent!  Our server Rachael  took out the time to explain what the best foods on the menu are, she has a bubbly personality and was a joy to chat with... we were greeted by an adorable young lady named Elle ... great attitude full of energy loved  her spirit... the manager \"Tyler always makes it a point to come over and say hello.......he makes us feel like family!!! We will definitely be back! LOVE this place Millie S."}
{"text":"So good! Fun tiki bar. We just came for drinks and apps, but we will be back! Open environment - so fun with the doors open to the outside. Great bar area. No wait - seated right away."}
{"text":"This place is a neat little spot in downtown Scottsdale. The service is good, the food was yummy. We went on a Saturday just missed the lunch menu, but it was happy hour until 7 PM so that was nice. Four dollars for a draft longboard and big wave. Ordered chicken tacos and they were pretty good a little on the dryer side but they were still satisfying. A little pricey for the food portions. It would have been worth itat lunch menu prices though. I like the whole vibe of the place, would not mind going back!"}
{"text":"Love love love Hula's! Every time I drag new friends with me to go to this place they always fall in love as well. They have a very unique menu for both food and cocktails! Usually my go to's are the Hula Burger or Korean Wings which sounds pretty basic but the flavor and quality of the food is amazing. I also like being able to order the Mac salad as a side opposed to fries. Most of their cocktails are made with rum but I do love the Bikini Martini because it has the perfect amount of froth! I recommend this place, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Had brunch here one Sunday after we realized that RnR's brunch would be a 2 hour wait and far too loud for some of our more hung over party members (me). The double cranberry mimosas are what we came for and we stayed for the food.  I had the French Toast, of which I'm not usually a fan of, but this came out P.E.R.F.E.C.T.  This is a plate that can be split between two people if you're not ravenous.   I also go to try my friend's ahi, which was so perfect I think about ordering just that sometimes, and I'm not much of fan of fish.  Two people in my group got the eggs benedict and were in heaven. The hostess was the weirdest though.  She didn't seem to actually SEE us when we came in until we actually said something, and getting her to do anything that didn't include having us expressly tell her what she should be doing was like pulling teeth."}
{"text":"Hula's never disappoints! Not only is the food amazing but the service is awesome as well. The pork tacos are phenomenal and the Mongolian beef bowl is a must!! My friends and I sat at the bar and Mike took great care of us. We will definitely be back soon!!"}
{"text":"Close to perfect..  Hula's for brunch in Scottsdale was super easy! Dose across the street had them down the block yet Hulas was merely 20% full. That's not a problem for me, and those waiting must not know what they are missing.  Service was friendly and efficient, with just enough of a personal touch. Service was... well Perfect Thank you's and Good Bye's from others on staff solidified an exceptional team committed to guest satisfaction or better.  My first sip was an amazing Ice Tea, honestly the very best I have ever had. I love Ice tea and lemon and sweetener was offered, not assumed. Refills arrived timely.  Meals arrived quick fresh and hot, mine in particular was very good with the exception of my eggs a tad over cooked but not worth a do over. Hash browns crisp and tasty, amazing bacon proves management is committed to excellent product. Just a slight let down that my English muffin could have been cooked another minute, it was soft and warm, served with butter and jam on the side. I like mine crisp but if this is how they are served here, I can live with that! I really enjoyed my side of Portuguese Sausage. High quality and authentic and just $2.50 for a nice side.  Great service, tasty food, a clean and modern dining room, and excellent value had me saying MAHALO!!!!!"}
{"text":"I so wish you could give stars by dept. We have been to Hula's now on two occasions. The first was a Friday night just for a drink. We had a Scorpion for 2 and it was delicious and well made. Service could have been a bit friendlier from the bar staff. A guy waited on us and was nice but there was also a female bartender with dark straight hair who looked at us and just kind of stood there while he jumped in. It was after main dinner hours so maybe she was just getting cut but it didn't look to good, at least to us. We did enjoy our drinks and knew we would be back. Second visit, party of 4 and we sat at the bar. Daniel was the bartender and was very friendly and attentive. He got us set up with menus and we ordered cocktails. My friend and I shared a scorpion for 2 since she had heard my rave review. It was good but not as well balanced as my first visit. These large drinks should always be made with portion devices/jiggers! It was a bit strong and I was feeling it the next day, fun night though!  This is where I wish I could put the star review to the right dept. as we started to order the list of things you were out of or weren't available was a bit lengthy and in no way Daniel's fault. He made some good alternative suggestions but it's really not cool to put your staff in that position. We enjoyed what we ended up getting.  In the end and will certainly be back. The build out and decor is great. Cushions for the metal chairs would be a nice touch though. Wish we had more sidewalk dining in oldtown. Smart move there!"}
{"text":"I always have a good time at this place! The atmosphere almost feels like you're out of town near the beach, at least it did when I went here last week. I haven't had their food in quite a while, but I really enjoy the drinks. Especially the Painkillers, theirs are some of the better ones that I've had :)"}
{"text":"We went here for lunch and can't wait to come back and try the Ahi Poke on the dinner menu (I wish they have more appetizer choices on the lunch menu).  I tried the Pork Tacos, which came with rice and black beans.  The pork was very tender and flavorful with a hint of pineapple.  My fiance ordered the chicken bowl, which was delicious!  The curry based sauce they used on the chicken was one of the best sauces I have ever tasted.  The service was slightly slow, but the food was wonderful!"}
{"text":"Ordered Cajun Ahi Caesar Salad and Ahi Wasabi Bowl comes out, which from above looks like it could be the Salad. As soon as I realize there's rice in my salad, waitress comes running out to let me know I'd been delivered the wrong entree. The Bowl was spot on, so I opted to keep it, but the waitress offered to swap it out for me and then gave me a notable discount on the food. Obviously accidents happen and she handled it the RIGHT way. The only reason I didn't go with 5 stars is because of the mix up. I'll be going back for sure...probably for the Ahi Wasabi Bowl."}
{"text":"My new favorite place in Old Town!! I am so excited to finally find a quality restaurant in Old Town that has it all:  -great food with lots of fun, delicious options -fantastic service -good ambience -a nice crowd   The one downside of this place is the decor. Sort of a random choice on seating arrangements--only a couple good seats in the whole place.   Sit with Ronnie--he's a Hula's veteran and he's a fantastic server. Try the coconut crusted hapu and the blackened ahi sandwich. To die for!! The Tiki Bastard is a fun twist on the classic Moscow Mule. Great place!!"}
{"text":"Went here for Sunday Brunch and started off with Fries and Sweet Potato fries. Excellent vibe, space for seating and the fries were very good. Excellent dipping sauce. Had the tacos (pork). Comes with black beans and white rice. The sides are plain but the tacos and seasonings are fantastic. Friends had the chicken tacos which are only slightly above average.   All in all, good flavors with the tacos, friendly service and great vibe. Definitely recommend for brunch on the weekend."}
{"text":"Me and my Hubby just moved here from Dallas and so we have been in search for great restaurants and we are thoroughly please with this find! Great drinks! Even better food! The habanero tacos are the best ever! The coconut shrimp roll is delicious! I will be returning for sure!"}
{"text":"Man oh man talk about stank! Samurai stick was more like a fresh samurai poo after a bountiful dinner of teriyaki sharts, so mushy, so dishonorable. The spicy Thai chicken bowl was so bland and belligerent that it made me yearn for my days in a Vietnam POW camp living off of rat droppings and coconut milk, called it jungle rice. Plantains were ok."}
{"text":"Great tiki drinks, amazing Hawaiian inspired food, and fantastic waitstaff. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This was our second time visiting, and we invited our friend since he had never tried this place. 2$ Mimosas were great, very warm but delicious and for the price you can't beat it. Unfortunately the waitress took so long to attend to us then we just asked for waters and it took a while for those to come so we finally place our order and the sides we had mentioned weren't brought to us, when asked towards the end of our meal we let her know and she never placed the order so we go without because we already ate our main course.  Poor service and attention to detail."}
{"text":"The owner reached out to me after my review to discuss specifics about my visit at Hula's.  I understand every restaurant has an off night, but every one deserves a second chance if they care enough to read reviews and improve service. I am changing my rating because of Dana, the owner and his care and concern."}
{"text":"Good service, fun atmosphere and decor.  We had the grilled chicken sandwich, which hit the spot for me and the chicken and pork tacos. The pork was very good as was the chicken, though the chicken taco was very spicy! Both items came with fries and the fries were really good- they reminded me a bit of five guys.  The big \"garage\" door was open so we sat outside in the shade, it was very nice."}
{"text":"Location great.  Prices fantastic.  Service ok.  Food ok.    Love the feel and location.  Perfect weather - the front was open and air was flowing through.  Lots of hard surfaces.  Lots of noise.  Aparently we were 1 of at least 4 groups I noticed celebrating birthdays.  So many hard surfaces though makes the sound VERY loud in the space.  Did I mention the noise?  Ended up only being able to chat with the two people sitting right next to me - the others at the table were on their own to visit.  Kind of made spending time with the birthday boy a miss.  Drink menu large and prices good.  My soda was kept full.  Check.  Service was ok.  Our server was very nice.  Only one complaint.  When you have folks delivering food to a table (especially a group) - figure out a system to know who gets what dish.  I was the closest to where the servers come with food - so I'm being asked to match dishes to guests.  See noise comment above.  I have no clue who ordered what.  You do - you took the order - figure it out!  (I do remember asking if server wanted to take our meal orders when we ordered appetizers.  She said no -I can only remember up to maybe 8 things - I'd have to go get a piece of paper to take more ... so I suppose \"who gets what\" would have overloaded the system.).  I guess what irritated me about it most is that once our end of the table - 5 of us - had our food - and everyone at the other end had none - I'm guessing - using my stellar reasoning powers - that any new dishes coming from the kitchen are more likely to belong at the OTHER end of the table - might make more sense to ask at that end to find the owner If your ordering system has no linkage to guests.  Food.  Don't know how others at our table felt - I do know I didn't hear any complaints (or should I say I COULDN'T HEAR IF THERE WERE ANY) - but I just have to say it was ok - nothing special.   If there were comments - it was too loud for me to hear them (I did mention the noise, right?).   I ordered the pork potstickers.  Deep fried and crispy.  They were good - and the peanut sauce and soy type sauce were ok as well.  Good start.   I ordered the Thai Chicken bowl.  The couple of plantain nuggets I had were seriously the best thing I tasted.  The chicken was tough - a little over cooked.  The sauce on it didn't give me any \"wow\" moments.  The bulk of the dish was cabbage and rice - a LOT of it.  Not a lot of natural flavor there.  Texture yes.  Flavor no.  Don't know if it was missing a sauce or something but a pile of blah.  I did use the left over potsticker sauce to flavor it ... But that was a little overpowering.    Bottom line - I'd go again if the group wants to go, the prices are great and the location is fun.  The food - it's ok.  I wasn't expecting a Michelin star but for Yelp stars gave me an expectation of more.  Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing.  And I'd keep my group small so we can visit better."}
{"text":"First I want to compliment Joe.. Great service and recommendations.. our first time here .. the meal was perfect .. I had the hapu pan seared.. My husband had the Loco moco and my son had the steak sandwich.. We can't WAIT to come back .. :)"}
{"text":"Great place, vibe, and unique food... highly recommended. I had the Chicken Jerk with a local IPA and couldn't have been more impressed. One bit of advice - the 'small' sweet potato fries are not a 'small' order at all, so if you are eating alone and unsure about the strength of your self-control you may want to skip ordering them at all, they are hard to stop eating once you start..."}
{"text":"Food was so-so. Drinks were good. I wouldn't go back based on the hostess being rude to a few people in my group though. Management shouldn't tolerate their employees acting snotty to customers."}
{"text":"Party of 4, we loved the atmosphere.  The food was ok.  We ordered the Hawaiian Ceviche, spicy Thai chicken bowl, luau pork sandwich and grilled chicken sandwich.  The ceviche tasted only like lime juice, way too much...the grouper in it was good.  The chicken bowl was good, not to spicy.  Grilled chicken with teriyaki and pineapple was great!  Luau pork ok, good portion of meat.  French fries were soggy with the sandwiches.  I will come back based on atmosphere and hope the food delivers a little more."}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed with the food. The atmosphere is good, and service was great, but it wasn't hitting my taste buds perfectly.  Cute drinks."}
{"text":"Came here with my dad for a birthday dinner and we both really enjoyed it. Went on a Sunday around 5pm. The restaurant was about half full and there was not much noise at all. The food is so good. The service was good too, waiter was knowledgable about the menu and helpful with recommendations for first timers but the food....yea the food is where it's at. We tried the fish cakes, pulled pork sandwich w/ regular fries, fish tacos, chicken sticks, beef sticks, and passion fruit margaritas. Food wise everything was hot, fresh and delicious and our drinks were small but tasty...a little too much ice in my opinion but still good. Anyways, I enjoyed it and I will be back soon to try some more of the menu. Great find."}
{"text":"Went back to Scottsdale location.  As always, the food was delish!  Staff friendly and great service!  The hapu bowl with line curry sauce is a must as well as the famous scorpion bowl!  You can't go wrong here -"}
{"text":"Had a spontaneous date night this past Tuesday.....after having a not so great experience on our birthday celebration in May, I was reluctant to come back. I'm so glad we did!! We had an amazing waiter, I know I'm going to butcher his name, but I believe its spelled Jhzyrus(?) He was very attentive,very courteous and just what we needed. You need more staff like him working on a busy Friday night and not on Tuesday!!! The food as always was on point! For us,it really was about the customer service! Bravo Hulas!! WE WILL DEFINITELY BE BACK"}
{"text":"The chicken wings are soooooo good! However my spicy Thai Chicken Bowl was terrible, so I ordered another dish hoping it would be better. Don't worry, I paid for both of the dishes and didn't send it back (I'm not the send back kinda gal). It was gross too! Wth?! Jerk chicken slop with rice. :( so sad. I had high hopes. Someone else ordered the fish tacos which they said were decent. That was a really expensive bill for not eating any of it. Sigh..."}
{"text":"Went for a team building dinner and it was great.  The Thai Spicy chicken bowl and blood orange martins are fabulous"}
{"text":"Don't go for the food. Maybe the drinks are pretty good and boost the rating. We had the Hula Hash breakfast scramble. It was eggs, has Browns and pulled pork. No sauces to make it interesting. Very bland said my wife who ordered the same thing.   Kids food was equally as tasteless.   We will never go back."}
{"text":"I can't say it enough, I LOVE the Scottsdale Hula's location.  We only found this place a couple weeks ago, and have already been twice.  The food is amazing, especially the pork tacos.  This location does the mayo-based slaw with their pork tacos, which I prefer, but you can also request the dry slaw they use at the downtown location if it is your preference.    The first time we went we had Charles (Charlie, I think) as our waiter.  He was absolutely phenomenal.  If he's working, definitely request him.  He's super friendly, very attentive, makes great menu suggestions if requested, and isn't afraid to give you an honest opinion of a dish, which I find to be a sign of a great waiter and restaurant.  The second time we went we also had an excellent waiter, but sadly I cannot remember his name.  The restaurant  is brand new, and has a large open-air layout with both indoor and outdoor seating.   The food is prepared fresh, and the portion sizes are generous.  My fiance is a fan of the shrimp rolls, the fries are hand cut, and the pork tacos are overflowing with juicy goodness.  Just writing the review makes me want to go back for more!  As if that weren't enough, they also have a full bar, and menu specials pretty much every night of the week.  The menu is pretty substantial, so if you haven't been before it may take you some time to decide what you want.  Fairly certain there is no wrong choice, but I think I need to back another time or two, or ten....ya know....just to make sure."}
{"text":"The space was nice, but despite being empty it took awhile to get our order in. I thought $10 for a fish sandwich was very reasonable, until I discovered that a side would be EXTRA, and the portion left me still hungry. I would've been fine with the sandwich size if it came with a side, but extra? Additionally our chicken tacos had a bone in them. They did comp them, and that's the only thing keeping this review from 2 stars. Would not return."}
{"text":"Excellent ambience, interesting food and truly excellent cocktails. One of my favorite local spots."}
{"text":"Everyone that knows me, knows knows that Hulas is my favorite bar. Ever since stepping inside the Camelback location for the first time, I knew this was the set up for me. When I heard that they were opening up a second location, I had to go Opening Night. This location does not disappoint!   ~Fud/Drink~ I really...honestly... don't know where to start. I could start with the Hawaiian-style food, like the array of tacos this place dishes out that will blow your taste buds away. My favorite tacos of all-time are here, their Ahi tuna tacos. Beyond legit and beyond comprehension with a soft seer and perfectly peppered. I could jump to their Fish cakes (only on Tiki Hour) which explode with flavor in the mouth. Boom goes the dynamite. And goodness, where do I begin with the flavors from the drinks?!?! The crowd favorite is the Mai Tai, which is nowhere near as fruity or sweet as a traditional Mai Tai. It is their best seller, however, mainly because it is a well tailored drink. Oh and the Dr. Funk will get you Funked up. I is so smooth! And how about a little bit of love to The Zombie, which I personally think is the best Zombie I've tried. I also was introduced to Pyrat Rum here, my personal favorite rum, from the One Eyed Pyrat. That is how you will find me, with a One Eyed on the rocks, light on the ginger beer. Folks, they kill it here.  ~Atmosphere/Service~ I always drink at the bar. It saves me on time, and the barkeeps are quite personable. They always offer up helpful suggestions and make sure I am feeling good. The atmosphere at this location is a bit weird, however, because there are so many options in Old Town. It will get packed for a 1 hour period then die off...only to have it get packed all of a sudden again. Needless to say, if you come during a basic off-period, its not because the place is lame...hardly that. I also love the tiki feel, its like taking a plane ride to Hawaii. There are no gimmicks or silly themes, its really a straight up dope place to have a drink with a friend or that girl you like kinda sorta ;-)  ~The Downlow/Extras~ Two extras to note: Each day during the week, minus Friday's , they have a killer special. Check the website for updates, but my personal favorite would be the Tuesday 2 for 2 night, where you get two drinks and 2 drinks for $20. I usually clean house that night. They always have a charity night on Mondays, where 10% of profits go to a charity of their choosing, SO GENEROUS! Also, they usually will have an all-day happy hour surrounding holidays, like Pre-Thanksgiving or Pre-Christmas, etc. Just to note in case family is in town, or if you are thinking about leaving town a day early....maybe wait a few hours and have a couple here, haha. This place just makes my day better knowing I can hop over anytime I want. 5 stars for the drinks, food, Tiki Time, and honestly Dana being the most personable owner in Phoenix. Spend your money here knowing it goes locally, and its a killer time. Aloha!"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick bite!! It was happy hour. Delicious food! We had a side of mac and cheese and lobster rolls. Server was friendly !"}
{"text":"If you love Hawaiian food then definitely go here. Great location with an upbeat atmosphere. Good prices and good drinks. They also have a small patio are that opens up in warmer months too."}
{"text":"Service: great. Everything came quick, server offered suggestions on what we should get, and it was an all around good experience in that regard!  Ambiance: love the look of this place! Exactly what I wanted on a Saturday for dinner. Not too loud, good decor.  Drinks: one word: STRONG!! This is definitely a good thing ;)  Food: this is where the loss of one star came into play. Had the won ton ahi thing and that was well reviewed except for the massive amount of ginger, but I picked it off. In regards to the entrees, the people I was with loved theirs! They raved about it. One had the Hula Burger and the other kalbi ribs (I think). The kalbi ribs were apparently better than what they'd eaten in South Korea. Mine, the Spicy chicken bowl, was so subpar. I was extremely disappointed. I wanted to send it back but I didn't want to cause any issues since everything I was with were loving theirs.  I'll definitely return here, there's a lot that looks good on the menu:)"}
{"text":"Pleasant enough place but it doesn't really capture the island vibe that was more evident at  the old Trader Vic's.  The sandwiches, seafood, and tacos were also good but they didn't really scream South Pacific nor did they necessarily stand out from all of the other great sandwiches, seafood, and tacos that are offered in area."}
{"text":"Hands down best food, drinks and service!!! Best restaurant by far in Scottsdale! Highly recommend this place if you're looking for a good vibe, good food and awesome drinks. Must get the chicken tacos and a Mai tai, seriously the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"We ordered a rum and pineapple drink that was yummy. Nothing over the top or different. The pork potstickers were crispy and flavorful. Loved them!  Our dinners were large portions and yummy. Pork plate and snapper with lemongrass.   The ambience was okay. Pretty loud and low lighting but overall we enjoyed everything."}
{"text":"Ok I would give it only three stars  because I was likely the oldest person here in the place.  I felt \"old\" around the twenty somethings in the place.  However the staff did not make me feel that way so it would not be fair to say it was A OK when it was likely a nice place to eat.... the drinks are reasonably priced.  I really should not care but I felt that maybe this place was not \"for me\". We did not have the food so go in and give it a try.  The entrées and main dishes looked really good."}
{"text":"Went out on a double date with my girlfriend and another couple the other night. Great location if you're in the scottsdale area. We all wanted to try something So we decided to check this place out. The atmosphere was great. It was a Sunday night so it wasn't busy at all. Didn't have to wait for a table which was nice. Would have been nice to have more patio space but still really liked the atmosphere inside.   The food was great. I was the only one of 4 who didn't really care for the dish but it was more of a preference thing than flavor. I ordered the Mongolian beef w/out the black beans and cabbage. (Ordered that the first time I visited and didn't like the black beans or cabbage so I asked them to hold both). The other three plates in the table were the loco moco (included in photos), the pork platter, and the Jamaican jerk chicken. All of which were absolutely amazing. Great portion sizes, and good rice, and overall great flavor. They also have a pretty lengthy spirit menu to choose from. And the food menu is also full of variety.    The service mediocre at best. We politely asked our server to switch tables, not thinking anything of it. Our server seemed put out. We didn't really understand why seeing as though the restaurant was nearly empty. He reluctantly agreed and placed us at a table nearby. When he brought out the checks, we only had two. One for my girlfriend and I, and one for the other couple we were with. Now I will say it was convenient for him to assume that we were on a double date. However, I don't think it was very appropriate. I don't think that should be assumed. It should be asked of by the guest. A simple \"how would you like the bill?\" Would have been much more appropriate. Food 5/5. Service 3/5. Total 4/5."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 15.  Service was good no issues.  I love Hawaiian food was expecting better/tastier dishes.  The food was pretty good but nothing really wowed me so not sure that I would return for dinner.  It's in a good location right by all the shops and its a nice atmosphere so seems like a better place for happy hour and drinks than a meal."}
{"text":"These are hard times as my wife is having medical problems and can't walk at this time and needs a wheelchair.  This does not stop us from eating in some of the wonderful restaurants in our area.  Case in point, we arrived at Hula and parked in a disabled parking spot and then couldn't find a way into the restaurant until a server came out and she removed lots of large rocks sitting on a couple of tarps blocking the opening to the restaurant's rear door.  What a lovely person she is!  I'm so glad we were able to get in because the food was excellent.  It was 2pm on a Tuesday and only two tables were occupied.  A good looking bar and table area greeted our senses.  We ordered sandwiches, made so well you hated to rip into them with bared teeth.  I had a blackened sea bass [HAPU] sandwich with taco slaw and sun-dried tomato pesto aioli, and the wife had a fried calamari steak strips sandwich with the same condiments.  The best and freshest tasting seafood, perfectly prepared were trapped between the 2 wonderful halves of a freshly baked large roll.  Also ordered a side of french fries, crispy on the outside, and tender inside.  Cooked the way they should be cooked or should I say fried. We had an epicurean and delightful moment orally shredding these tasty morsels.  Service was spot on despite the energy consumed by moving many mini boulders :).  We shall return to try the many wonderful items on their menu.  What a hidden gem.  If you like fresh seafood or just well prepared meals, this is the place!  On the way out we were shown the correct way out by using the sidewalk out front.  Too bad our server didn't know and had to work so hard but I love her for it.  Here are the menus : http://hulasmoderntiki.com/menu/lunch/"}
{"text":"Wow! How awesome! Rachel was incredibly helpful with all of our questions about the drinks and the food. She helped us find the perfect drinks (which were amazing!) and food (which was amazing too!!) Try the hula burger and the blood orange martini! The prices are really reasonable for the location and everyone seemed down to earth and not Scottsdale snobby."}
{"text":"This new location really hit it out of the park!  Remarkably good in atmosphere, service and food.  Can't wait to come back!  My husband and I were biking by and saw this adorable new location of a place we like downtown, and stopped in - so glad we did!  The decor is lovely - tons of blond wood, an open floor plan, 50s tiki bar feel, gorgeous bar - even the bathrooms are really cute!.    The hostess was really nice, but the server was just wonderful.  He was super helpful, gave us tons of information, and had a 100 watt smile, to boot.  On his advice, we ordered the blackened Ahi tuna sandwich, and it was amazing!!  The fish was really fresh, the seasonings really brought out the flavor without overpowering it, and light coleslaw and pico really rounded it out.  This was accompanied by some spectacular sweet and regular fries - absolutely the best fries I've tasted in a long time.  Really top-notch."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Hula's Phoenix, and we came to the Scottsdale location out of convenience because we were celebrating my birthday nearby and decided on dinner here first since Hula's is my favorite.  The service was weird, there is no other way to describe it. It didn't have the same welcoming vibe as Phoenix and we had to listen to a strange explanation of why our table was actually for someone else but now we are sitting there.. blah blah.  The spicy thai chicken bowl was GROSS. It had shredded lettuce in it instead of cabbage, I am not even sure why hot lettuce would be a substitute.   The only upside is that the restaurant is very nice on the inside. Other than that, we will stick with Phoenix."}
{"text":"Best pot stickers in Arizona :) I would also recommend the fish tacos!! Also has such a great atmosphere! Always fun and friendly"}
{"text":"Awful food...  Burgers were way over cooked and had no flavor, waitress was really unhelpful. Would never go again."}
{"text":"During out shopping in downtown Scottsdale, we noticed this restaurant, and realized none of us had ever had food classified as \"Tiki\" and curiosity had us. They were pretty busy, and all the patrons seemed happy and enjoying them self, and the staffed helped us immediately. We asked to see a menu before they sat us, just to see what type of food they served, and they were happy to oblige. Everything sounded so good, and would be fun to try. Also, being that it happened to be Happy Hour, it didn't make for a hard decision to stay and eat. Everything was so amazing, and the waiter was extremely helpful and explained everything we wanted to know on the dishes. Aside from running out of Key lime pie, there was no let down what so ever. Can't be mad about the pie anyway, I'm sure if it was as good as the rest of the food and drinks it goes quick until its gone. Definitely will be back on our next trip out."}
{"text":"Food was to die for. We ordered the shrimp rolls, fish cakes, pork tacos, and tofu tacos...everything was on par ESPECIALLY the shrimp rolls and pork tacos. The highlight of this establishment was the service. Our waiter was perfect and what was most surprising was that the food/drinks came out at light speed. Beds happy hour spot in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"My favorite college buddy (actually he's the only one I still keep in touch with) was coming through town so my husband and I took him to lunch at Hula's.  I've been wanting to go since they opened in Old Town.  We reminisced about my first real concert over Hula's yummy cocktails...reliving the trip from Flagstaff in a car with no windows...in August...to see Metallica.  I wasn't even sure who that was.  I only knew he had lined up at Ticketmaster at 4am (before Al Gore invented the internet) to get good seats for his can of crazy girlfriend who refused to go at the last minute anyway.  Ah, those were the days.  And completely irrelevant to this review.  So for those of you that haven't turned the channel yet, Hula's does have some fun cocktails.  And while I love some of their appetizers, I thought lunch was just okay.  I really liked the Hawaiian ceviche with wonton chips (again, great apps).  The mango chicken caesar salad and mac salad, eh, okay.  Good, but not great.  I was also a little put off that my friend wanted to order from the dinner menu, but couldn't.  We were about 20 minutes early, and understandably, the kitchen could not accommodate, which was fine.  However even when we asked our server if we could just have our drinks for 20 minutes, and then order, she still said \"no.\"  I guess she was concerned we would take up the table for an extra 20 minutes??  That would have been another round of drinks, but I guess it wasn't worth her time.  It hasn't been worth mine to go back, although I certainly wouldn't rule it out."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Hula's opening up a spot in my hood!  I've been a handful of times and have not been disappointed with the food, drink or service.  Hula's hash for brunch was amazing, sweet potato fries are yum ... Dr Funk, Zombie and Tiki Bastard are among my fave drinks. I did not care for the lilikoi (passion fruit) margarita, but there are plenty of other options to choose from.  I haven't done the lunch or dinner menu yet, but I'm sure I will soon!  I'll be trying out a veggie/vegan option next time.  The layout is nice and hasn't been overly crowded on any of my visits.  I've always been able to get a table and/or sit at the bar.  Tables are comfy and they have a big community-style table in the bar area that would work good for a group doing drinks & apps during happy hour (which they've dubbed tiki hour.)"}
{"text":"Spicy edamame was grilled to perfection and just the right amount of heat. The house made black bean vegetarian burger was one of the best I've ever tasted. Great selection of cocktails. Excellent service. Great atmosphere, music."}
{"text":"This place was fun. This was the 2nd stop on a girl's day of drinking and merriment. I had already bookmarked this place and then a fellow Yelper also recommended this place to me.  I started out with the Blood Orange Martini. It was delicious. Not too sweet, not too bitter, it was refreshing.   Then my friend and I started sharing cocktails so we could try a few different ones and not get totally blitzed on only our 2nd stop. LOL. We tried the Dr. Funk which was Ah-mazing and went down very fast and smooth. Those could get you in trouble.   After that we tried the Hula's Hurricane and it was also very good. Not your typical hurricane, but still really nice. Very festive.   Our service and servers were awesome. We started out at the bar, then wanted to sit outside, but the wind got to us after a bit, so then we moved back inside to a table. Never once did I feel like we were a bother, and they happily accommodated our whims.   I saw on the menu that they had Moco Loco, one of my favorite dishes, but sadly we had eaten just before coming there. Wish we would have come back the next morning.   This was a fun way to hang out and people watch and have some wonderful cocktails. Definitely a must go-to.  Oh, I forgot to mention, it was Happy Hour all day and the cocktails were like $6 each! A great deal!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of checking Yelp & Tripadvisor whenever we travel to see what restaurants are happening.  We go to Scottsdale at least once or twice a year & Hula's popped up this year when I was doing my latest restaurants update...we had planned on stopping in for dinner one night, but actually ended up stopping in for brunch when our fav place was clearly over packed on a Sunday morning.  They opened at 10:30, staff was quick & efficient, and we had an enjoyable breakfast!  Looking forward to testing the lunch & dinner menus another time!"}
{"text":"Hula gets a high five in my book and I'll sum up why they do. First of all, they serve brunch on Saturdays and Sundays but that's not even the best part. They also serve all day happy hour on Saturdays and Sundays as well. Technically it's not called \"all day happy hour,\" but they serve it from morning until 7:00 PM. In my mind, that counts as all day! Do you know what this means? $2 mimosas and $5 cocktails. I almost didn't want to give away the brunch secret but since I love Hula's, I decided to share it anyway. The brunch was really good and they have a great Polynesian twist on basic breakfast items. They even offer fried spam for their eggs Benedict. Very random, but I'm almost intrigued to give it a try. Almost. Not only does the brunch menu include breakfast, but it also offers a wide variety of sandwiches and tacos.   Besides weekend brunch, they also have a great lunch and dinner. I've enjoyed both the Polynesian chicken sandwich as well as the steak sandwich. Both were flavorful but I personally like the steak sandwich more because it had a serious kick. I wouldn't get it if you can't handle spice. The chicken sandwich had a delicious teryiaki like sauce. We have also had their crispy shrimp rolls which were a nice way to start the meal. They were tasty but not overly filling. My favorite cocktail? The Painkiller or the Mai Tai. They taste like vacation. All that's missing is the ocean but Scottsdale will just have to work on that harder.   Finally, I really like their chill atmosphere and open environment. It's very fresh and airy with the big sliding doors and the patio (although small) is perfect. Do you have a four-legged friend? The patio is dog friendly!"}
{"text":"We went to Hula's the other day and thoroughly enjoyed our time. It has a fun Hawaii/tiki theme that resonates into the food and drinks. Much of the menu is fish or island themed. We tried two of the different kinds. The wasabi style is fantastic, though I would have preferred a bit more of the wasabi flavor. My girlfriend had a style of fish that ended up being slightly overcooked. I would highly recommend the ceviche. It was the best part of the meal. The ambiance is nice, but it does feel out of place in Old Town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Against my better judgement I decided to give this place another try.  We arrived at the restaurant at 12:35PM and at 1:35 PM were still waiting for our food.  The place was not busy.  Our waitress stopped by once during that time to check on our drinks.  It seemed the place was just extremely slow overall because the people around us that were there when we got there had to wait a long time for their food also.  The food was disappointing again.  I ordered a plain cheeseburger.  I actually said plain, just meat, cheese and ketchup.  It came COVERED in onions.  There is nothing I despise on this earth more than onions.  My hatred of onions is worse than Lord Voldemort's hatred of Harry Potter.  The waitress tried to take it back but there's absolutely no way I'm going to sit around and wait for another hour for a 2nd order so I told her to leave it.  It then took forever to get our check and pay the bill.  I know other people enjoy this place but I can't think of any reason I would ever eat here again."}
{"text":"Again, Hula's is the best! For a surprise birthday party for the wife, Hula's  says No Problem. They accommodated our group of 19, with separate checks, and not one mistake on our orders. The service was impeccable. Drinks always full and food served quickly.  This place always makes us feel welcome whether it's  just the 2 of us or 18 of us."}
{"text":"The drinks are insanely cheap before 6, and after 6 they do a 2 appetizer + 2 cocktails deal for 20$! Their loco moco is so good that I have ordered it 3 times now. If you're looking for a great starter, the beef sticks with pineapple are my absolute favorite"}
{"text":"I've moved away from Az, but this is my \"must-go-to\" spot whenever I'm in town for work! The Lilikoi Margarita, Crunchy Spicy Chicken Tacos and Jawiaan Jerk Pork plate are all excellent!"}
{"text":"Came here with my Aunt and Cousin on my trip to Phoenix. We had the coconut shrimp rolls which were good (I'm not a huge coconut fan) and I had the baja fish tacos which were awesome. I'm really not a huge fish taco fan but I took a chance and I am so happy I did. The sauce went really well with the battered fish and I couldn't get enough! I wish the beans had come separate from the rice because the rice was good but I hate beans so I didn't eat much of it! I also had a hurricane which was good! Overall it was a great experience!"}
{"text":"My first time here, my three companions have been here before and highly recommended Hula's modern Tiki. It was a very busy Sunday morning, but other places along Scottsdale Road were ripping, so I didn't feel bad about the non-existent wait. It's very refreshing to walk into a restaurant and have linen napkins, the atmosphere was very pleasing albeit a little loud. Our server Tyler, was on top of things took our order, and food came out piping hot and most excellent. I had the hula Burger and can highly recommend it. We don't normally do dessert, but had the coconut cream pie, and OMG. Needless to say we will be going back, and probably frequently. The food was excellent, servers were excellent, prices extremely reasonable."}
{"text":"A quick lunch with my brother.  It was brunch time and happy hour.  I ordered a yummy hurricane drink and it was gorgeous with plenty of fruit decorating the glass. I ordered a lunch combo of house salad with a light miso dressing. It came with their signature shrimp coconut rolls.  Big and plump and  crispy. A dipping sauce with pineapple was the perfect accent.  My brother order a thai chicken bowl. It was huge and light and fresh tasting. The atmosphere was very hipster - great lighting and not the dowdy tiki hut atmosphere.  Don't miss an opportunity to explore the menu."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night for dinner .. Got seated quickly , service was quick ..Ronnie our server was pleasant & helped with the menu .. We ordered the fish .. It's was nicely prepared, moist .. Great choice of fish too ..  If you are in the area check it out !     Place is packed on weekends so make sure to make reservations ."}
{"text":"Went for brunch after Race for the Cure.  I had the eggs Benedict with Portuguese sausage instead of ham.  $2 mimosas were a hit. Hash browns were nice but could have been a bit crispier and warmer.  Hollandaise sauce was tasty but I would have preferred thicker.  Will give them another try maybe for dinner. Cute place, cool vibe."}
{"text":"Simply great Hawaiian food. The kalua pork is juicy and tender, the ceviche was fresh with the perfect acidity, and the gravy on the loco moco I can drink as a cocktail. Speaking of cocktails, they have an amazing happy hour which runs pretty much the entire weekend. Drinks start at $5 and taste so good that you have to be careful not to drink 5-6 before you know you're pretty much drunk. The atmosphere and service is amazing though. So feel free to hang around and savor the good times with your friends. That way if you leave after drinking 6 drinks in 2 hours or so, you won't feel like a total alcoholic."}
{"text":"We stopped in for an early dinner after arriving in town. We had a good meal, low key, We would stop back here and try it again."}
{"text":"I love that Hulas made a second location because every time we head to Scottsdale/old town and we can't make our mind up on where to eat, we head to Hulas...  I love their Mai-Tai's...   As some of you may know I am a huge fan of their \"Hangover Hash\"... Not because I'm hungover quite often but I love the ingredients... That luau pork over the crispy hash browns goes great with the 2 over medium eggs on top... That is my go to breakfast/brunch option...  I have so many other favorites on the menu but I'm making myself hungry as I write this review so this one will be a short one...  The decor here is very cute and goes well in the Old Town area... Service is prompt and some days get busier than others... Great job Hula's #2..."}
{"text":"An update to my review from 5 months ago i forgot to post ....i was pleasantly surprised after I wrote my first review in August that the manager contacted me and sincerely apologized.  He refunded our money back on the bill and also sent me a gift card for a generous amount to eat there again.  I do have to praise the manager for his help and pleasant nature towards my situation.  Great customer service!"}
{"text":"Loved it! Went for brunch Sep 2014. Loved the vibe, food, and cheap drinks. I had to indulge my sweet tooth and have the french toast with plaintains. It was amazeballs. My boyfriend had a salad with tuna and he enjoyed it as well. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This has to be one of the best restaurants I've ever been to in Scottsdale. The food has been amazing each time. The portions match the price, and the staff has been amazing each time."}
{"text":"Service was great. Juan Carlos was an excellent attentive server. Great personality. Food was good and reasonably priced. Only thing is they give you WAY too much food! But we enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Glad I had a chance to check this place out, it was pretty cute! Smaller than I expected, but I liked that, good for nice days too with the outdoor seating. We went at 3:30 on a Saturday afternoon, and it was more crowded than I had anticipated! We were seated right away though. I was excited by how extensive the menu was, there were lots of choices! Some especially interesting sounding tofu/vegetarian options, I will come back and try more. I tried out the black bean burger with sweet potato fries as my side. We were served quickly. Our server was nice, she did a good job. My sister ordered the same thing as me and she loved it. I did not like it as much as I thought I would have, it was just a bit bland with not enough mushrooms on it, I thought. It was good, just not super memorable. Fries were tasty, I liked the sauce they served it with too! My mom got chicken skewers and really liked them. Next time I think I would order something else, but overall it was an enjoyable experience!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love, love, love the food at Hula. The lobster bisque soup, the Hula Burger, the Bowls they're all amazing!  The service was super slow but the server was very nice.  The only thing I would count as a downfall is they're patio is way too small and the inside doesn't have a comfortable atmosphere so the dining experience isn't that great.  Since the food is so amazing I'll probably just do carry out."}
{"text":"Food was so good! Had the curry prawn appetizer.  One of the sauces was pretty spicy (8/10) and another  (4/10); delicious, but beware. Had the dukes pork plate and it's super juicy pulled pork.  So bomb!  Waiter was great (Daniel), helped me choose between some entrees and made fantastic choices for us. If you still have room for dessert,  try one"}
{"text":"Love this spot!  Great drinks, fun atmosphere and good food!    The drinks were awesome!  I ordered a Painkiller...cause I really had a headache. It was delicious..Appleton's rum, coconut, pineapple & orange juices..refreshing!  My husband had many Mai tais. I tasted one and it was strong and limey with Appleton's rum, orange curacao, pineapple & lime juice, orgeat and  dark rum.  Fun place to sit, drink and people watch:)  We started with the crispy shrimp rolls. Yum!   I ordered the blackened Ahi Sandwich which was good.  It included slaw and a sun-dried tomato pesto aioli.  My husband had the burger and had no complaints.   Our server was great!  We will be back."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Sam Smith - I'm Not The Only One)  Yelp and me, we made a vow For better or for worse I know you wouldn't let me down But the proof's in the way it taste For months on end I've had no doubts  Eating everywhere I wish I could come over now But I know that you'll be there  I say I'm hungry Cause Scottsdale just around the corner But when is Happy Hour I go to Hula's Modern Tiki!   Hula's Modern Tiki Scottsdale is a 2nd location to the popular Tiki off Central in Phoenix.  Overall, Hula's Modern Tiki still the same concept and design; a 50's style luau with a modern twist in drinks and food.  I came on a late Tuesday night to catch the game and hang with a buddy of mines from Los Angeles.  He was flabbergasted by the prices, \"They're so cheap compared to where I'm from\", Yes I agreed.  Plus, we have water and I'm sure glad I don't have to over pay for food here in the valley!    Hula has daily Happy Hour specials so check them out, but tonight I shot for a IPA and ordered the Habanero Chicken Tacos while my buddy went for the Loco Moco.  My dish was pretty darn spicy and I'm sure they used just a tad bit of habanero, but it worked with marinated shredded chicken while the crunchy cabbage slaw provided some texture.  The avocado is always a welcome and the sweet aioli balanced it out pretty well.  I didn't even use my salsa since I thought the dish was well put together.  Only thing was I didn't care for the corn tortilla since it was definitely store bought; I rather have it freshly made and would have made this dish kickass!  My buddies dish was a \"traditional\" Hawaiian meal.  To me it was a Salisbury hamburger patty atop a bed of rice and a fried egg over everything.  He rather enjoyed it, but I didn't really care for it.    In the end. Hula's is still a hot spot for Happy Hour whether in Phoenix or Scottsdale.  The food is a fusion of Hawaiian and Southwest with some modern American funk.  Service is pretty good and overall and solid spot! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good sushi and even some authentic Hawaiian beer! Who would've thought!?"}
{"text":"I returned to Hula's for a second try, and I was totally impressed. The scene was vibrant and the service was top notch - even the manager recognized his server was very busy and stopped over to check in with us. The food was awesome, and the portion plentiful - I had the Jamaican Pork Plate. I couldn't get enough of it! We also ordered the crunchy spicy chicken tacos, which weren't very spicy, but I understand some don't like things as spicy as others...I suggest kicking it up a notch! I can't wait to return to try more things on the menu. Big thanks to the owner for reaching out to me after my previous experience."}
{"text":"Finally made it in... and... wow! All the reviews are legit. Proteins are marinated for impressive lengths, drinks are liberally poured... and the service is warm and genuine. Pull up a chair, close your eyes... and put something tropical in your mouth!"}
{"text":"I love hulas, my favorite thing are the potstickers I can eat them all day everyday. I took my girlfriend here and every time we come we order at least 2 or 3 of them."}
{"text":"Food and service are wonderful here.  The ambience, pricing and location is ideal for a great eating experience and in the heart of the old Scottsdale buzz."}
{"text":"Loved the Wasabi Ahi Tun bowl!  Would love to go back next time I'm in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Minutes after writing my first review for Hula's I received a sincere apology letter from Dana at Hula's.  Now THAT is what I call a solid, caring, good business owner.  Not only did he apologize for my experience he took the time to ask for more details about the service.  I'm impressed at his quick action and willingness to make things right.  I hate to sound like a tough customer, but sometimes speaking out on Yelp is what it takes to make a difference.  With that being said, I will DEFINITELY be back to Hula's.  :)  Thanks Dana!  Sorry for the first rough go 'round!"}
{"text":"Ronnie L. Our waiter was excellent.  Our first night at Spring Training. This place was busy.    I was in the mood for a light meal.  Chicken Salad for me and my wife..   Everyone in our group of 4 had a great time.  I purchased a Tiki mug to remind me of our great evening, BUT, on our return home,,, our luggage got vandalized, ,  and buggers took my mug.    Thanks for the great memories."}
{"text":"I'm glad they are open now in Scottsdale.  It saves me the drive to Phoenix.  Their servers are friendly and the mai tai is as good as ever!"}
{"text":"We've now eaten @ Hula's three times.  Food is always fresh & exciting. They offer several fresh fishes prepared your way from a list choices. How cool. The salads are huge and very tropical. Lots of fresh mango. Drinks are exotic and fun.  Great place to meet up w/ your friends for Happy Hour. Our Hula Girl Jenni was super. We are making this place a regular stop...."}
{"text":"Excellent happy hour.  Had the coconut shrimp rolls - loved the rolls & dipping sauce.  My husband thought the beef skewers were fantastic.  Sweet potato fries & sauce were very good.  They were crispy, not soggy like sweet potato fries can be.   The Pain Killer was delicious and the happy hour prices were very reasonable.   Service was excellent.   I'd go back if I lived in the area."}
{"text":"Had a good time there. Seating is limited and had to sit outside when it was super hot. I also ran out of there so fast because I was on a date and forgot to tip by accident. The waitress decided to take it upon herself and add a $5 tip onto my card which I wasn't pleased about. I always try to tip but I find adding on money for yourself to be rude."}
{"text":"First time at Hula's and enjoyed the food. I had the tofu tacos and it's amazing how paprika made the tofu taste yummy. It was wrapped with a tiny bit of cabbage and two corn tacos with rice on the side. I wish there was more cabbage but overall still good. My guest had the black bean burger that came a-la-carte, a bit disappointed, but she said it tasted good. We will be back."}
{"text":"So I have been coming here since it opened and I still feel the magic. The staff makes me feel so welcomed. I would name them all but, you know who you are. I have never had a bad experience here. When it is busy, jusr have some patience and you will have some amazing food and a great experience. The beer is always chilly on a hot day and always get your food with bacon, it is ridiculous. Sierra, and Ronnie make me feel like a Rockstar when I come in which makes me tell everyone to go to Hula's for an amazing burger or a huge crisp salad. If your a fan of pretty women or hot men this a great place to start your day."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is fun and the food is great! Casual.  The drinks are good but not the best. Good.  It's a good starter point for a starter tiki drink fan but it's not for a real enthusiast.  I would return though."}
{"text":"Came here while at a conference with my coworkers. Definitely expected the retro '50s hula-and-pinup-style tiki bar and whomp whomp what a letdown. The place resembles most Thai restaurants up here in NYC. Don't get me wrong. It's clean and modern looking. But in NO WAY resembles a tiki bar except when mai tais with paper umbrellas on them were on the table.   Food was decent. I had a pineapple glazed grilled chicken sandwich. Coworkers had various fish dishes and drinks and enjoyed them. Waiter was kind of rude and impatient with one of our group who needed an explanation of some of the menu items.   All in all, don't come here if you're expecting a tiki bar vibe AT ALL. Come for the food which was alright, or the drinks which tasted and looked good."}
{"text":"Had to try this since my wife family has strong Hawaiian roots. Easy choice when we walk past this one.  The atmosphere is amazing, very modern, well kept appearance with good music, and everything you would want in nice decor! Great design job.  The food, having strong opinions on Hawaiian food was not the best. They have some traditional dishes and some modern takes as well. We started off with the poke, which is raw tuna. The fish was fresh but the poke wasn't seasoned right or didn't have enough sauce. Kinda poke light if anything. Had the pork dumplings that came with two dipping sauces, they were standard dumplings you can get anywhere. Also tried their meat skewer which was just okay. Overall I was left wanting the true Island taste that has so much to offer.  Based on the appetizers I tried I didn't want to try any entree after that. I am a little biased when I comes to Hawaiian food, expected a little better. This still is a fun spot and I would try it if you want something that is harder to get in many places."}
{"text":"Reviewing this place after our second visit. The atmosphere is super chill and relaxing for a daytime drink and/or lunch. The staff is personable and the drinks are great and well priced-- even better if you catch happy hour. The poke appetizer is definitely something to write home about-- I'd be back for that alone. The pulled pork sliders were yummy too.  Such a great staple place."}
{"text":"Awesome food ! the food was a hit for everyone I got the spicy thai chicken bowl and my other guest got the Mongolian beef bowl & the Hula burger. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We came here for lunch on our last day in Scottsdale before we caught our flight home to Seattle. We sat outside in the shade. We ordered a volcano drink and split it (I think you have to). I had the ahi tuna Cesar salad. It was the perfect amount of spice, it was huge and delicious. We will definitely go back next time we're in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Loved it! Coconut shrimp rolls and baja fish tacos were my choices tonight. The waiter ( and host) was super friendly. I will come back here the next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Server was super helpful! Food was delicious and the blood orange martini is fantastic."}
{"text":"This place is great. The service is attentive and quick. The menu has a lot to offer in terms of choices. The drink menu is just as extensive and the atmosphere is modern. The food is a fusion of Hawaiian, Asian, Polynesian influence. It is a great spot to take a date. I will definitely be back. Great food!"}
{"text":"I visited the Scottsdale location after having a great lunch with a friend at the downtown phoenix Hula ocation. I ordered a Pink Bikini Martini, and my husband a Mai Tai, which were fantastic. We also ordered hapu ceviche, which was fresh and flavorful. For dinner we both ordered Ahi Tuna Sandwiches-- which I was sadly disappointed in. The Ahi Tuna was tough with a lot of tendons.. I could barely eat it, honestly. Sad because on my previous visit I ordered the Ahi Tacos, and they were delicious. For $15 for an Ahi Tuna Sandwich, I would expect a better cut of Tuna. My husband wasn't quite as offended about it and he loved his sandwich. I will definitely be back-- the appetizer, drinks, and ambience won me over even if the meal wasn't quite right."}
{"text":"Cute place, great service!  The coconut rolls are awesome! The Thai chicken bowl is a favorite. It's great when the doors are open the weather is awesome. Good happy hour. Hard to find parking."}
{"text":"I was here on Christmas Eve because they were open and they mentioned a party on their site.  The only way you would know it's not any other day of the week was the bartender's Santa hat and Christmas lighted beard.  Some Christmas music or island music would have been nice instead of alternative.  Happy hour prices all night was nice and I ordered crispy chicken tacos.  It came with three fried corn shell shredded chicken tacos and black beans on top of rice.  Everything was cooked well, but bland.  The chicken did not have much taste and neither did the beans or rice.  The creme sauce drizzled on the beans and rice at least provided another flavor.  Too bad the same type of crispy chicken taco at Chili's days earlier was 10x better."}
{"text":"Tiki Bastard.  Great cocktail, try it.  Great bar staff.  Love this place.  Food is diverse and really good."}
{"text":"This is a great place in the heart of downtown Scottsdale to get your Happy Hour on! Especially since the HH menu goes till 11pm.  The decor is tiki/kitschy/cool...modern tiki vibe..very clean..tvs at the bar if you want to catch a game while enjoying your spirits and local grinds.  On this particular night we had a 2 year old in tow and they couldn't have been more gracious! (They even had a high chair). I was starving and my friends only a little hungry so they ordered pupus (ceviche and pork tacos) and I had the spicy ahi Caesar salad everyone was pleased with their food.  Large portion for a dinner salad..flavors were on point.  The specialty drinks are fruity and fun and usually come in a fun glass to compliment what's being served.  I love taking out of town guests here and so far everyone I bring compliments me on my great choice!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are pretty much obsessed with the Spicy Thai Chicken bowl! We order it at least once per month and it's always great! Whether we get take out or dine in the service is always great and the location is awesome too!"}
{"text":"The drinks were great but strong, food was either very bland or very spicy, ambiance was a nice outdoor lounge feel. The Scorpion bowl was a good drink but the bowl it came in looked like it was bought in a back alley tourist shop in chinatown...see pics"}
{"text":"What a wonderful find downtown! The food was exquisite!  Must have the ceviche and Poke...to die for! Everyone's other meal also looked good. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I travel a lot and it's really wonderful to find something different and unusual.  Who would imagine a Hawaiian place in Arizona!  Happy hours and nightly specials, but I had the Mongolian beef bowl instead.  It's beef on a bed of white rice, beans and cabbage.  Not a heck of a lot of beef but the sauce was incredible.  Very filling and I don't imagine lot of calories.  I finished the whole thing - it was that good.  Had two drinks - the painkiller was good (Reminded me of beach vacations years ago) and the blood orange martini was excellent too.  If you get this combo it would be better to drink the martini first (it's not as sweet as the painkiller).  Bill was $29 plus tip - I think reasonable for the area and type of place.  You can definitely save if you go for the specials.  Friendly and professional wait staff.  Five stars, it's my new go-to place in Scottsdsle."}
{"text":"I loved the Scottsdale location.  We went on a weeknight and it wasn't insanely busy like the downtown Phoenix location.  They allow for a casual dining experience without all the stuffiness of some Scottsdale restaurants.  Our waiter was amazing, very attentive, even asking how we liked our drinks.  The food was the best part!  We ordered the CocoJoe Chicken Plate and Jawaiian Jerk Chicken plate.  I highly recommend the Jawaiian Jerk Chicken."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! The pain killer is a pina colada on steroids!  Not frozen but delicious!  Come try this cool old town Scottsdale location.   The Ahi poke is a must!  Forgot to take a picture cause the food looked so amazing I had to eat it!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch and loved it! The food was great, I had the Spicy Thai Chicken Bowl and the Cesar Salad. My server was super friendly, and the venue was modern and smart! Can wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"For a new restaurant I think they did very well.  I went on what I believe was their  2nd night of being open. My group started with the spicy edamame, the ceviche, and the house made fries. I'm very picky, the ceviche had a huge thumbs up from the table, as did the amazing fries. I think the edamame could use a BIT of tweaking.  The group all looked very happy with the entrees ordered.  I ordered a green jungle curry bowl, really good kick of spice, which I appreciated.  I don't believe in bland! I'm not a dessert person but they do have homemade desserts I was told by the cutie server girl. I visit Scottsdale for biz, I will go back (and even try the edamame again)."}
{"text":"The food here is so interesting and I love the atmosphere. Fun drinks and good prices =]"}
{"text":"Cute little hawaiian restaurant with mexican fusion. Great selection of tropical drinks, mai tai's were spot-on. On a yelper's recommendation, we ordered the crispy coconut shrimp rolls with pineapple dipping sauce and they were outstanding. Probably the best part of the meal! Though I ordered it as an app, and got it after our meal was served. My mom ordered a bowl and it could have probably feed at least 2, if not more people. Delicious with the rice and cabbage. I ordered the pork tacos which were OK, they tasted way better with the salsa they provided. Dad ordered a salad, mango chicken caesar, which was a hit! Would love to go back for dinner to try the SCORPION OR VOLCANO BOWL which serves 2 or more. Lunch woudl have been a little early for that!"}
{"text":"Cool vibe. Great happy hour too!  Welcome to Scottsdale, Hula's!"}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday night and this place was definitely happenin'  Positives:  - The luau pork dish was absolutely delectable - Happy hour, even on the weekends! Just get there early - Inventive takes on drinks - Really enjoyed the casual, yet modern atmosphere  Negatives:  - They still weren't taking reservations unless it was for a party of 8 or larger. The hostess did us a favor and allowed us to make a reservation for 6. Even though it was for 8:30, we definitely would've had to wait for at least 15 minutes if we didn't make that reservation...so this policy doesn't make sense - Our server either forgot orders or mixed up orders twice. But she was really nice and seemed to be trying her hardest on a busy weekend  - Tahiti lager; would not recommend - Things were a bit more expensive than I anticipated when portion size was taken into account"}
{"text":"I enjoyed a terrific spicy Thai chicken bowl.  5 star taste and presentation, but at $13 for lunch, I docked it a star for being a bit pricey.  Outstanding service and a tasty Kono coconut-flavored brown beer made for a wonderful lunch experience."}
{"text":"Tried this place based on Yelp reviews. My husband and I had the steak sandwich and Jawaiian Jerk Pork Plate...both were delicious. The menu is pretty extensive for a smaller place so it was hard to decide what to get!  Would give it 5 stars except for how loud the dining area is. Would definitely eat here regularly if I lived local."}
{"text":"The entire experience was so so food was mediocre at best , service was pretty good not great. Would not go again."}
{"text":"We went to breakfast on a Sunday morning. Hostess greeted  us & seated us right away. I ordered the eggs Benedict which was great ! My husband ordered the Loco Moco , which was just ok , the gravy needs to be revised . The Mamosa's were great ! Our waitress was very nice but she had too many tables & was overloaded. She apologized for the slow service and took off one of our entrée for the bill  overall it was good & I would try it again ."}
{"text":"Hula's by far is one of my top 3 restaurants in the valley and when i heard a second location was opening in Scottsdale i was excited!  This new location offera a nice easy going come as you are atmosphere and love the  large open patio.   Our service was terrific, she offered suggestions and made sure our drinks were always full.   Food was terrific, we ordered my favorite Coconut shrimp rolls with the pineapple sauce is AMAZING! I ordered the luau pulled pork with sweet potato fries, these portions are pretty generous too, I took 1/2 home. My boyfriend ordered the Jamaican jerk chicken with rice, johnny cakes and plantains. Very generous portions....and very flavorful. I posted pics on here too.   Highly recommend giving Hulas a try....oh, my favorite drink is called The Painkiller.    Thanks Hulas for another location, great service and delish food :)"}
{"text":"Hula's has a great atmosphere and amazing food!  The mai-tais here are the BEST!! Not too sweet or fruity! Our server, Ronnie, was so helpful with suggestions and spot on with his recommendations! We started with the \"fish bites\"...so moist and fresh with the perfect \"crust\"! We shared a Caesar salad: the $6 side could have fed 4...huge! Hubby had the macadamia hapu and I had the lemongrass hapu...ohmigosh both were delicious! The lemongrass taste was light and not overpowering in any way...I was a bit cautious and really enjoyed it...glad I listened to Ronnie!"}
{"text":"What a yummy place!! We were here for our girlfriends bachelorette party. She liked Tiki bars so we decided to find a place. Not only do they have great tiki drinks BUT they have an extensive menu as well! I had the ahi tuna and it was just so fresh. The hurricane drink I had was awesome! You can taste the fresh juices that were in there. You can also taste the rum... tiki drinks are no joke. They really like to put a lot of alcohol in those things. If anyone is in Old Town Scottsdale, this place is highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We stopped in Hula's to try and find a bar with beer on tap and catch a bite to eat. We were seated at a table, and my wife instantly remarked on how angry the host seemed/acted. I went to the bathrooms which are all individual but with a push handle, making them seem like multi-use restrooms resulting in the mid-pee anxiety when someone inevitably pushes on the locked door every minute your in there (signs or a lock with an occupied sign outside would do wonders for confusion). The cute, young waitress took our order, and both appetizers came out before our drinks did. Our drinks that had been sitting on the bar the entire time we were there. We had to ask a different waitress to get them for us.   The appetizers were small, not really meant for sharing with more than one person, max, and definitely wouldn't supplement an entree. The food wasn't bad, but had too many conflicting flavors, and our disappointment at the service made us leave to find a different restaurant to have dinner. The drinks were great, it's in a good location, and I wouldn't actively tell people not to go, we just didn't have a good experience here.  EDIT: the owner of Hula's reached out to apologize for the experience and to see if I could provide more feedback as a teaching moment for their staff. It was such a professional and classy way to address my concerns, despite how great their ratings already are. I added a star because that was really above and beyond what one poor review out of so many great ones deserved. Thanks!!"}
{"text":"What a great surprise find in the Old Town Scottsdale area. We didn't know about the original location in Phoenix, but this location was recommended to us by my hairstylist that also is in the area. The parking lot is very small (about 5 spots) and doesn't have an exit, so be warned that you may be doing a 10-point u-turn to get out of it when there are no spots.  That is really the only down side, which isn't really too bad considering all the parking around the area!  They were running Happy Hour (which they even have on weekend) so we ordered a Mai Tai and the Dr. Funk, both of which were very good, although the Dr. Funk would win 1st in our book.  I had the crispy coconut shrimp rolls, which were phenomenal, and the pineapple dipping sauce was just the icing on the proverbial cake here.  For lunch I had a burger with blue cheese. He had the pork tacos.  I'll probably get the tacos next time around, since they were cooked perfectly and the garnish was fresh and amazing.  My burger was cooked exactly as ordered, and the blue cheese was great - I just think I'll mix it up next go round with tacos!  Our server was Charles, and he was incredibly nice. He made great recommendations both with food and drinks, so if you can sit in his area, do it.  Overall: A+ Go there. Get coconut shrimp rolls. Dr. Funk is amazing. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"My new favorite place in old town!!   The drinks are amazing, the food is really good, I love the hula's wings and my husband loves the Cajun burger, he said is the best burger he has ever had and on top of everything they have happy hour on the weekend.   We really really like this place :)."}
{"text":"Great Hawaiian style food, customer service and energetic atmosphere. Food was outstanding with good size portions. Hostess and waitress were excellent. The location allowed us to go for a nice walk around the Old Town area after our meal."}
{"text":"So, stopped by this place for some appetizers and a few drinks after a little Sunday Funday in PHX.....I have to be honest and say don't remember all the appetizers we ordered but will say they were all fantastic. Didn't order an Main dishes as the appetizers well were all so appetizing. Lol recommend for a couple drinks and place you can chat and catch up"}
{"text":"I have always wanted to try Hulas but never had the time to go to the central location.  Ehen I found out one opened up in Old Town I was so stoked. I came in the other night wanting to see how it was and lemme tell you I was totally impressed. The atmosphere was amazing. I tried the ceviche and I loves it.. the bartender Max was fantastic.. great energy and engaged with me as well as other patrons.. he made me feel comfortable and suggested the spicy teriyaki chicken bowl. .I loved it.. so glad I tried hulas because im bringing 10 to 12 ppl back for my bday dinner saturday night.. hopefully max will be there and can whip me up a bday shot haha.. I work in old town and will recommend this place to others"}
{"text":"First of all, Tyler is hands-down one of the best servers I've ever had. He's pleasant, well-versed on the menu, and committed to excellent service. Ask for a table in his section... On to the food: my bf had the steak sandwich cooked medium-rare and said it was outstanding. I had the macadamia-crusted mahi mahi with a papaya salsa and it was also great. If you're into dessert, try the \"pot brownie.\" Don't worry, it's legal."}
{"text":"Good was good, however service was terrible, it took about 10 minutes to get silverware after they dropped the food. A cup of coffee took 20 minutes and French fries are \"a la carte\" with a burger during lunch. There's better places to go within a block of this place."}
{"text":"We came to Hula's on a whim for Father's Day brunch and it was delish! We were big fans of the Loco Moko and Luau pork sandwich! Also, the lilikoi margarita is wonderful. Our server, Joe, was great! Loved the vibe & atmosphere of this place!"}
{"text":"The pork potstickers were amazing!! The wait staff was very friendly. We really enjoyed the atmosphere and both the pork sandwich and the hula burger were some of the best sandwiches we have ever had! I highly recommend this fun restaurant."}
{"text":"Great drink great appetizer, really great HH. Other meals seems really tempting will come back for branch tomorrow . Seems like all workers are working hard and very pretty ppl works here! Bad things is owner don't sell tank top! I could wear in CA would have add for everyone!!!!!! But not for sale ;-( bad"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots to grab food and drinks with friends. Great appetizer menu and very chill atmosphere! Even if I don't know what I'm in the mood for, can't go wrong with just some spicy edemome, fish bites and a mai tai."}
{"text":"This place is a solid 3 stars. Great interior, small outdoor eating area and a nice looking bar.  Overall the food and service was ... okay. They have do have vegan options and one pretty good tofu taco for happy hour."}
{"text":"Went to Hulas last night after movie with a girlfriend. We sat at the bar. This place is very cute and love something different other than the normal boring old west style places in that area. Drinks were fabulous. Food was even better. Highly recommend the Poke and the Coconut Shrimp rolls. Staff was pleasant too. Overall very nice experience. Will be going back :)"}
{"text":"I've been meaning  to try this place , I'm happy I finally got to stop in. The food here is pretty good ! I had the Jamaican pork and my date had the ahi tuna. We were both satisfied with our choices. I loved the Maui pineapple wine , it was absolutely amazing. The service was just fine and not overbearing. The atmosphere of this restaurant is fun I like how they have and open patio. However I did not enjoy the rude /standoffish hostess. I understand people have off days but damn she was unfriendly. So much so my date even mentioned something. Anyways check this place out it's well worth it!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by Hulu. The food was incredible, one of the best shrimp tacos I've ever had. Good mixture and something totally new in Scottsdale. The ambiance can be better that's why it's a 4 and not 5, but maybe I'm bias since I've lived in San Francisco and have seen some pretty awesome tiki restaurants.  Anyhow you should check this place out! Also tried my bf pork tacos and they were amazing."}
{"text":"Great new spot that has a different atmosphere than most Scottsdale spots.  Worth checking out."}
{"text":"Great concept, great service! I had the luah pork sandwich...ok but not great. My friend had the tacos that were delicious."}
{"text":"Very hip place with friendly service.  We were the only family there but we got there early so we didn't quite feel so out of place.  We ordered a thai chicken bowl, a mango chicken Caesar salad, a steak taco and a jerk pork plate. It was all pretty good,  I have to say the jerk pork plate was probably the best. The meat was very juicy and not dry at all.  The cocktail drinks were also fun. We ordered a dr funk which had coconut rum, vodka, creme de banana, pineapple and oj and also a tiki bastard which contained Gin bourbon cherry syrup lime cock n bull ginger brew.  I think the tiki bastard was better and that's because I got a fix for bourbon lately."}
{"text":"Pulled pork sandwich with coleslaw was amazing, Polynesian Chicken Burger !!! . Service was good and prompt, but server was not in her happy place today. If she smiled once I would have gave it 4 stars."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch. They don't have anything but coffee and a small breakfast menu so I ordered the Chef's  omelet. All I can say is that this was completely gone in about 3 minutes because it was sooooo good!!! They prepared it with fresh eggs, cheddar cheese and the most amazing pork I have ever had.  The hash browns were average but I would still come here again just for the meal I had. The decor is trendy. Nice place to grab a bite without a wait."}
{"text":"Hidden gem!  OMG, seriously the best Thai Chicken bowl I have ever had. It's not even in the same class. Plantains? I hate them, but love them here. Get the Dr Funk drink, it's a creeper but it is awesome."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times and the food is always very good.   And not over priced.   They have the best fish sandwich I have ever eaten.   Really very good."}
{"text":"5 stars for a Dr Funk drink and a superb offering of crispy coconut shrimp rolls. Par excellence . We will be back."}
{"text":"The food was decent. Cocktails were great and service was excellent. Nothing to write home about but pretty good."}
{"text":"Had lunch there. Ordered the burger. The meat was almost raw. And took almost 45 minutes with only six people in the place. The menu is sparce and \"fruity\"."}
{"text":"We had the hangover hash!  It was delicious and we loved the serving size!!!  Great staff and service."}
{"text":"Service was horrible! The server never filled our water glasses at same time even though they were low at same time.  My order was also wrong and instead making a new hamburger they just removed what was wrong with it and did horrible job doing so, so the item was still on burger and then my burger was over cooked and cold and so where the fries. Would not recommend!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is just AOK...nothing really special about the food or the restaurant. The hula tiki fish sandwich had a thin piece of fish, tasty but not the best. Best part of the restaurant is its location in Old Town Scottsdale..."}
{"text":"Ate at Hula's for breakfast -- wow!  Outstanding meal in a fun atmosphere.  Very large window/doors allow it to open up when the weather is nice.  I definitely recommend it.  Great food and a reasonable price."}
{"text":"AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS!!! Their menu has so much of an variety! Great service and atmosphere too! Hands down my new favorite spot! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Went in for late night drinks and enjoyed the scorpion bowl and a dark and stormy. Great for sharing with 4-6 people. Loved the ambiance-it was perfect for our group. They also have a pot brownie-a giant vat of molten brownie in a flower pot!"}
{"text":"Great clean Hawaiian taste. Ceviche was light, fresh and tasty. The bowls are filling and delicious. Nice environment and great service."}
{"text":"Met my daughter for lunch during the week. We sat outside and enjoyed the street view. I had the pulled pork sandwich and my daughter had the seared ahi.  They were both very good.  The waiter was very attentive without being annoying.  I'd go back!"}
{"text":"This is actually a 4 1/2 I ordered the omelette it wasn't bad but not the absolute best either my bf had the Cajun burger which was delicious and they have an amazing happy hour $2 mimosas?!! YES please!! Plus our server/bartender Daniel was amazing! Extremely friendly and attentive he made the experience well worth it so we will most definitely be back here! I also want to add that their specialty cocktails are delicious I fell in love with the 'painkiller' and I'm hoping to come back and try their dinner menu"}
{"text":"Hula's is a great place to enjoy some Hawaiian Fusion cuisine. The atmosphere is great and the wait staff is top notch, from the hostess to waiter and bus boys.  We started our evening with a Margarita and Deschutes White IPA then some appetizers, which were happy hour priced till 6PM. The Pulled Pork Tacos are huge and the Thai Fish Cakes were tasty. For dinner we chose the Mongolian Beef with Lime Curry and Kalbi Korean Ribs. Although the beef was a bit too rare for even my wife's taste, the flavors were awesome.    Prices were moderate and the servings were good. We skipped dessert but I'm sure it would not disappoint.   When in Scottsdale, give Hula's a visit."}
{"text":"Nice pleasant experience From sitting at the bar talking with Rubin to being served with my guests at table. Lots of choices-"}
{"text":"The food is ok. I don't think it's expensive for what you get. I think the atmosphere is cool... very modern. But food was so so."}
{"text":"We came here with the intent of having brunch.  We sat at the bar so we could watch golf.  They were having a mimosa special for $2!  And, it's not just champagne/sparkling wine and o.j.-- you could have pineapple juice, cranberry, and some other kind of juice (I forgot what the last one was).  We ordered a pineapple mimosa and it was delish. We were also going to get food but got a text that someone made lunch for us. We told the bartender and he was still cool.  Definitely coming back here next time we're in town."}
{"text":"Service was a little slow, but it was summer so I understand slow season. Not usually a salad fan, but it was huge and good."}
{"text":"I was worried about parking because we went to Hula's on Saturday evening, but had no trouble finding parking close by. I was apart of a large party and was pleasantly surprised that they were able to accommodate all of us. Hula's had one long table and it's nice for large parties or laid back dining for multiple small parties. The service was a tad slow and they only came around once to refill our waters. The restaurant wasn't very crowded either, considering it was a late Saturday evening.  I got the Samurai Beef Sticks as a starter and Jawaiian Jerk Pork Plate for my main entree and the food was delicious. The Samurai Beef Sticks were a great start. It came with 3 beef stick kabobs and the beef was so tender and the grilled pineapple was sweet and juicy. The Jawaiian Jerk Pork Plate was excellent and huge, definitely enough to serve two people. The pork had a mild kick to it and a lot of flavor. The Plate also came with a scoop of white rice with mango salsa on top, plantains, and jamacian johnny cakes. The Plate came out with a pretty presentation and was amazing!  Hula's also has many cocktail, red and white wine options with a few non alcoholic drink options too. Overall, really great food with many drink and food options, but the service was a little lacking."}
{"text":"Incredible food with good service. Also very fairly priced for incredible food. Would go back in a heartbeat. One of the best restaurants I've gone to this year"}
{"text":"The menu had so many good options that it was hard to pick just one thing. In the end, I decided to get the Jawaiian Jerk Pork plate. So so so good. So much food too. Amazing flavors. The restaurant itself is nice, but a little on the small side. Only one TV so don't plan on going here to watch a game. Small patio, but they are pet friendly so that is a HUGE plus! :)"}
{"text":"The menu is hit or miss but anything fresh is usually a safe bet. The poke is really good - a little heavy on the soy sauce if you're a poke snob - but for a peasant like myself it's spot on. The real reason I'm taking the time to write this review is the key lime pie.  I don't like key lime pie - but I loved this key lime pie."}
{"text":"Since moving to Scottsdale, I was hoping and wishing that Hula's would open another location. Finally, my wish came true! Luckily, it lived up to my high expectations as well.   Like the other location, parking is small and practically non-existent. Keep this in mind when visiting. It is best to park at one of the many other parking structures in downtown Scottsdale and then walking to Hula's. It will save you a parking headache.  The actual restaurant is pretty open with a small wrap-around patio. Inside has a bar and plenty of tables for small to large groups. As you walk in, the hostess greets you and asks for inside or out. We chose inside and were seated immediately. Our waitress was young and friendly. They all wore uniforms, which (if I remember correctly) the Phoenix location staff doesn't.   We were in time for happy hour, so my husband and I each ordered a Dr. Funk - coconut rum, crème de banana, pineapple and orange juice. Additionally, we ordered the crispy coconut shrimp rolls - only $5 at happy hour. For dinner, I ordered the steak tacos and my husband ordered the big kahuna (a large ribeye steak). Our drinks arrived promptly and our shrimp rolls arrived shortly after. The drink was perfection and the rolls were delicious. Once we finished our appetizer and first round of drinks, our dinner arrived. Both of us ordered our steak medium rare and they came out cooked perfectly. The tacos were especially flavorful and I love the rice with beans side dish. My husband enjoyed his steak as well saying it was tender and flavorful.  Overall, we had a great time. This location is just as good as the Phoenix location and we'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is so good. Seriously glad I came here for a visit. Loved the tiki cocktails, the coconut shrimp, the skewers, and the vibe! It's definitely hipster and modern. If I'm back in Scottsdale, I'd want to visit again for sure!"}
{"text":"Hula's is the Bomb.com! We celebrated my 40th birthday on a Saturday night. 3 weeks out we called and made a reservation for 14 people. Upon arrival our table was ready, and the hostesses were very friendly. Not many places in Old Town would accommodate a large party on a Saturday night.  Our server was extremely friendly, and the food was awesome. Highly recommend any of the Tacos. Most the of the party goers ordered the tacos, and raved about them the rest of the night. I had the pork Tacos, to die for!!! My wife brought a cake, and they served it up for the entire table. Service is top notch at this restaurant. You can really tell all the staff works hard to make sure everyone is happy and having a good time. The drinks were good also, mine came with a back scratcher. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"I love this place!! Great food!! They put a twist on traditional island food. Food was on point and full of flavor. I would say though, I was disappointed then ran out of the dessert I wanted!! Brownie with MacadamiaNut Ice Cream!! Server was good, checked up on us quite often and always made sure our drinks were full!!"}
{"text":"Happy hour all day Wednesday!! Delicious specialty cocktails and the burger rice entree is so savory and perfect to split"}
{"text":"So pumped about this addition to Oldtown.   -Lobster bisque: ample chunks of lobster meat and a creamy, flavorful broth.  -Ceviche: perfection served on delicious wonton crisps -Mongolian beef is A MUST. It has some kind of lime, coconut curry sauce.   Think it's safe to say anything here w/ a sauce of some kind is a home-run."}
{"text":"Really good menu with many different choices. Food is delicious. Cute ambiance in old town Scottsdale. Fun drinks like a pink bikini martini. Good service."}
{"text":"**Updating this review, since Dana (the owner was VERY quick to respond and went above and beyond to rectify the situation and assure me that he takes feedback seriously and handles it with grace and kindness **   I'm not sure who our server was (since he didn't introduce himself, nor did any of us want to ask) but the service last night was  really disappointing. We had a large party (15) and we called in advance (two days prior) to make a reservation. This was a going away party for a close friend, that turned in to the entire table feeling as if we were walking on egg shells because server was so condescending and rude to us. It ruined the experience for us. He told us from the time we sat down that he would be assigning seat numbers in order to make it easier to create separate checks. He asked that we \"not move\" or that he would have to spend \"a long time figuring it all out\". The only thing was, that we were still waiting on two others to join, and we even told him that they were running late but that we would all like to order drinks. It took another 15 mins or so so flag him down, because he only took the drink order for the person on the end and walked away. After ordering our first round, our additional two guests arrived and sat toward the middle of the table (I think they should be able to sit where they'd like ) but the server huffed and made us all feel really badly for \"messing up his system\". When he finally got around to taking orders, he got to the two in the middle and asked to take their order while he was flipping through his sheets of paper with disdain. The person whose order he was taking felt bad and innocently asked if it would be easier if we gave him our names. He very quickly snapped back at her, \"I'm tired, you all moved around. It's fine... I'll figure it out\" then furiously shuffled more paper. This was the tone, and the attitude he had with us for the remainder of our meal. He made us feel as if we were burdening him the entire time. I work in hospitality, and I believe that when service is great it should be recognized. On the flip side, this server could've really done a better job at making us feel welcome. Instead, we were all hesitant to ask for things knowing he would make some sarcastic remark, or give us an uneasy feeling. There were other small things, him leaning in on the back of our chairs, not bringing us all water even after we requested some, and asking us to stack our dishes and pass them to him (which, i would get if they were in hard-to-reach places, but they were not). I get that people have bad days, and it's a bummer that he was tired, but he could've made a small easy effort to ensure that things went more smoothly than they did. It's much easier to throw on a smile than let your bad energy trickle down to everyone else. I also frequent Hulas Downtown, and as always, the food and drinks were great."}
{"text":"The service was great!  The waiter was attentive but not overly so.  There is a wide variety of food choices to meet the needs of a diverse group of eaters.  We had the mango shrimp and blackened mango chicken which they made without the chicken blackened and we added avacado.  The mango was not ripe so it wasn't as sweet as it could have been but still very tasty!  We have been back a couple of times now and love the drink selection."}
{"text":"Awesome strong drinks. Happy hour all day on the weekends. Went on a Sunday but because of the small kitchen they were able to provide us with appetizers until 3:30. Great service was great people were friendly."}
{"text":"Bless Your Heart.  Oh, bless your little heart Hula's.  I'm a little behind on reviewing this new location because I've been swamped with visitors.  Had I done so earlier from all my previous visits, my review would have garnered more stars.  Kinda glad I dropped the ball.  So I call to make a reservation for a party of 6.  I was told that they only take reservations for 8 or more and to just 'walk in'.  In March.  Seriously?  Walk in during spring training with six people?  In Old Town.  I was also told it was \"no problem to walk in\"   Um, yeah.  I'm a local not a tourist and I know better.   Eh, whatever. I decided to take my people elsewhere where we could get a reservation. No big deal.   I did however, post that I think not taking reservations for 6 is a bad idea.    The obnoxious response I got on Facebook, however.  Bless your heart.  BEing told I \"missed out on a great time\"  is almost comical.    REally?  Your response to a frequent customer's complaint is to tell me how I \"missed out on a great time?!\"       While I in no way expected a \"hey, we will change our policy for you\" response, I sure as hell don't appreciate the \"too bad, you missed out\" comment. A simple professional comment such as , we apologize, or wish we could help, or any other bevy of comments would have been more appropriate.  Bless your heart Hula's.  I shall be taking my large parties elsewhere. My large parties continue the entire month of March.  I shant' be bringing visitors there.   so , Hula's.. \"you missed out\" on really large bills from a bunch of drinkers and out of town visitors with money to spend!"}
{"text":"Breaking update: Hula's is still amazing!!!  Highly recommend the South Seas fish tacos (I add avocado), their white rice with that delicious creme fraiche, the mac salad, and of course - pie for dessert!  Thank you to Hula's for the always-killer meal and on-point service. I keep comin' back!"}
{"text":"Hulas has some of the best fruity drinks around. Great place for a date or a group of friends. I recommend with a group to get the punch bowl type of drinks. Delicious and great value! Food is $10-20 range, but never had a bad dish."}
{"text":"I generally really like this place, but last night I had a service experience that was incredibly disappointing. The server was extremely discourteous to me and my friends. She hardly approached us besides to take orders and deliver food, and the wait between delivering food to our table and asking us if we needed our checks took a full hour, and only happened because I ended up approaching the host stand to see where she was. When she came over, she gruffly said, \"I heard you guys were ready to go?\" -- my friends were engaging in a conversation and were laughing as she approached the table, and when she tried getting our attention she looked at our table and said \"I'm sorry, is something funny?\" Rude and discourteous. I don't understand why you work as a server if you genuinely are so rude to your customers."}
{"text":"We love this place. Fabulous bloody marys!  I enjoyed the ahi eggs Benedict. OMG so amazing!  The menu is so interesting!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch the other day and had a great experience. I got the jungle tofu bowl that came with fried plantains which were delicious. My dad got one of the burgers with egg and mushroom gravy- he cleared his plate! The food is fresh and simple, I really don't think you can go wrong ordering any of the dishes. Our service was wonderful. Lauren, our server, was attentive and friendly and always making sure we were doing okay. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Amazing! I'm from Philly which a big food town and this place kills it. Good drinks too. Plantains! Coconut shrimp rolls! Mongolian beef bowl! Amazeballs! Also had a piece of ahi which was good and Johnny cakes were nice!"}
{"text":"Excellent service - I didn't love the ahi bowl but the Mongolian beef looked amazing! Scorpion bowls are delicious and dangerous - watch out!!!"}
{"text":"We came late on a Friday night. The music and vibe was fun!  The food was great and menu choices seem to have a variety. We started off with shrimp egg rolls. These were very flaky and tasty! The Terihaki chicken bowl way big enough for us to split. It wad excellent with a nice mix of sweet and spicy!"}
{"text":"They have awesome shrimp rolls and amazing sweet potato fries got a small order and I shared it with my husband it's was so much.. Ohhh but so yummy"}
{"text":"Great place for brunch with the old town Scottsdale vibe."}
{"text":"My wife and I brought our parents here yesterday for an early Father's Day celebration - at my father's request. We had all been here once before as well as to the Phoenix location, also once before, so were eager to return.  We were not disappointed. The food portions were all reasonably priced, generous, and prepared to perfection. My dad and I particularly enjoyed the shrimp tacos.   In my opinion, Hulas serves THE BEST mai-tai - even better than Trader Vic's, which purportedly invented the recipe. And at $6 during happy hour, there is no better price deal to be found.   We enjoyed excellent service from our waiter, Ronnie L.  Looking forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"So excited that they brought this place to Old Town Scottsdale. Their food is amazing, especially the fish tacos. I just wish their was more patio space."}
{"text":"Just got my first experience of this place and nothing really had much flavor at all. I couldn't even tell what kind of protein was in my fish tacos because it was so bland. Boring and uninspired food. The only thing that has any flavor is the macaroni salad which only has flavor because of the miracle whip dressing...didn't taste of anything else. Will not eat here again"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying out Hawaiian cuisine and I absolutely loved it! My husband and I were in Phoenix for the weekend and decided to try out Hula's on our last day as we have never tried Hawaiian food back at home. The place was highly rated at Yelp, and the restaurant didn't fail to impress us! Our waiter was super friendly who gave us free refill of our drinks (we just ordered ice tea and lemonade- nothing fancy, but it was really good). Although it was Hawaiian, the restaurant offered tastes from all parts of the world-thai, Japanese, etc. We ordered the lobster bisque as starters and the Mongolian beef bowl and the ahi tuna-wasabi bowl as entrée and it was absolutely delicious! We were so hungry and the food was so good that we finished it in minutes. The lobster bisque was yummy...The gravy in both the bowl dishes was just about perfect and the combination of rice and black beans were spot on. I will definitely come back here next time I visit Phoenix!"}
{"text":"We had a great date night here before a movie! Their happy hour is fantastic. We ate 4 apps from that menu and had some drinks and it was great and not too expensive. The bartender was awesome and explained the special drinks they have and even gave me a little floater on the house because he said it was delicious...and it was!"}
{"text":"Yummmmmm-o!! Definitely mouthwatering! I'd come here again  We came on a late Friday night and it was not busy. We were seated right away! Our server was friendly and always smiling. The service was great!  I ordered the luaus pork plate! It was delicious, tender and juicy! I definitely recommend this dish! It also comes with coconut rice! The coleslaw was just all right! Nothing spectacular! So I didn't eat it.  I tasted some of the loco moco also and the burger patty was cooked to a perfect medium! The eggs were cooked perfectly. The mushrooms in the gravy added a nice flavor."}
{"text":"Service so far was a bit slow, however, to be fair they had employee outages.  Drinks were good and moderately priced.  Bloody Mary was average however the Mai tai was excellent.   Salads are huge and well worth the $$.  Ahi was wonderfully seasoned whether in a sandwich or bowl.   Bottom line is eat here you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is great!  To keep it simple, I love the food, the drinks, the happy hour, and the bar staff was excellent!    I don't know what is wrong with most yelpers, but if you want to review a restaurant as an actual critic does, you need to not bring expectations along with you.  Too many yelp reviews have been based off of expectations, but those are completely wrong.    Just go dine, take it all in, and then present your review, if needed.  Also, we don't need to hear every single detail of your bun, sauce, taste of the burger, crisp lettuce, blah, blah, blah, blah, BLAH!!!!   We get it!!  You think you're a creative writer!  But no one cares!   Just go here, eat some food, have some drinks, and enjoy yourself!  You're welcome!"}
{"text":"The food and service were wonderful.  The drinks were great.  If you are going here for a \"tiki bar\" prepare yourself for the fact that they are a \"modern tiki\" establishment.  The tiki vibe is there, the drinks are there, the food was amazingly great.  It is a great place with great folks doing the tiki thing.  They get it done.  A must eat!!"}
{"text":"The name \"Hula\" makes me think of greasy Hawaiian BBQ but I can promise you that you won't find any of that at this hopping Scottsdale eatery. My friend and I went for lunch and we were pleased that they had their own parking lot (albeit small) and we were surprised that the interior was classy (whereas we were expecting uber casual beachy). Service was prompt and friendly and it was only a matter of time before our lunches arrived - Caesar salad with shrimp rolls and a Polynesian chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries.  The Caesar dressing is amazing so I would recommend any of the Caesar salads here.  The Polynesian chicken sandwich was excellent but definitely a little messy so if you are at Hulas on a first date or lunch interview I would skip it.  :-).  For visitors from colder parts of the country, I can see where they would really enjoy the garage doors that roll up for access to the small outdoor patio and to welcome Sonoran breezes.  Not only is the food good here but the atmosphere is great too.  If you are fortunate enough to be there when the weather is ideal it's reminiscent of a San Diegan or Hawaiian ocean front burger stand."}
{"text":"This place was great. We sat at one of their outside tables. The husband had the 1/2 order of ribs and I had the most delicious fish with yummy side dishes. Waitress was very nice and helpful. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Awesome food, especially for the low prices.   Came in on a random Friday afternoon, knowing practically nothing about this restaurant. I was glad to find the menu to be filled with a wide range of variety from burgers to rice bowls. I had tried for the first time, the corn bread they have which let me say was suppose to be a side dish. Ended up taking most of the table! Which after tasting the bread, was a good thing to have some left over. Had an order of the ribs which were cooked pretty good. Though I wish the sauce had been a bit tastier. Not complaining though, ate most of them! Definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"I would give this 4.5 stars. The service was amazing the server was very accommodating to much wifes eating restrictions.  The fish sandwich was good. The fish tasted very fresh. Happy hour all day on Wednesday."}
{"text":"They have soooooo many drinks to choose from here. The food was so-so and I probably won't eat here again but the drinks!!! The drinks are worthy for coming back again and again. There's a drink that even comes with its own back scratcher! Crazy! The staff is pretty amazing but service is a little slow so either be patient or don't come here if you're in a hurry to go go go go go. It's a great happy hour spot as well. Came here with a few friends a couple of times."}
{"text":"Aloha. \"Island inspired\" eats in old town Scottsdale! Yes please. Hula is a modern tiki bar with the perfect mix of Polynesian and American flavors. It's one of my favorite spots to have a light lunch with great cocktails.  - Crispy Coconut Shrimp Rolls $7 (served with a pineapple horseradish dip) - Surfrider Chicken Sticks $7 (asian chicken grilled on skewers served with a thai peanut dip) -  Spicy Thai Fish Cakes $7 (white fish, cilantro, chili, red onion, fish sauce, ginger) - The pink bikini Martini $8 (pineapple infused vodka, sweet & sour and watermelon liqueur) - Dos equis $5  The food is delicious and Cocktails are amazing. I cannot wait to go back and eat more of those spicy thai fish cakes MUST TRY. Service is Good.  Don't forget to checkout the Happy Hour which is Monday through Friday 3:30 to 6 pm. ?All App's and signature cocktails are $6 during HH.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch one weekend with my family. Staff is very friendly,  efficient, and accommodating. Food was fresh and delicious,  and not overpriced. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Addendum: The owner contacted me to let me know this server no longer works at Hula's, and didn't represent their standard of service.  Based on the owner's willingness to communicate with me and make amends, I'd be open to returning next time I'm in Scottsdale, and hopefully will be able to update my rating!  -----------------------------------------------------------------  Hi!  I'm vegan.  I try not to make a fuss when I eat out with friends, but Hula's made it difficult.  I've never met a more exasperated waitress in my entire life.  It started off fine enough.  \"Are your hashbrowns made with butter or oil?\"  \"Butter.\"  \"And they can't be made with oil?\"  \"No.\"  \"Okay, I'll have avocado and toast.\"  I got avocado and a buttered English muffin.  Two things - thought it was pretty clear based on our previous conversation that I'm not into butter, but also...\"I'm sorry,\" I said.  \"I can't eat English muffins.  Do you have toast, like sourdough or something?\"  Siiiigh, sure, okay.  \"Sorry,\" I called after her.  All of my friends turned towards me.  \"Why are you apologizing?!\"  \"I don't know...reflex?  She looks annoyed with me?\"  Then when she came back and said the toast would be coming up, I clarified that I didn't want butter on the toast, remembering the English muffin situation.  She stopped in her tracks, sighed, and then went to the kitchen, without saying a word to me.  Oh...wow.  What I got was Texas toast (\"no butter!\") grilled where they grill buttered Texas toast.  Okay, I'm done.  I almost ate it anyways, but the smell of butter and the hardness of the avocado stopped me.  \"It's not worth it, dude,\" I said to myself, nauseated by the smell.  Had I made it clear I was vegan, it might've been a different story.  I was trying to be easy (avocado and toast are usually so fail-safe!) but it just didn't work this time.  I have zero complaints about the $2 mimosas, and they do have a clearly marked vegan option on their dinner menu.  Both the English muffin and Texas toast were removed from my bill, so props to at least being aware that I was unhappy.  But the situation was bad enough that none of my friends wanted to go back, even though they all had great food.  I have pretty awesome friends."}
{"text":"I went to this location yesterday and I was a little disappointed. It just didn't have the same 50s tiki lounge feel as the one downtown. The menu seemed to be mostly the same. Since I was there with some friends on a workday for lunch we didn't get any cocktails. We all ended up getting the two taco plate and we were all pretty happy with them. The grilled fish was fantastic! I also got the pork which was good except that it came with a gross coleslaw even though I had specifically asked if the slaw had a dressing and she said no, it was dry cabbage. She didn't come by to ask how everything was so I just let it go. Overall the service was not that great but they are pretty new still so I'll let it slide.  I'd like to give them a try for happy hour but overall it didn't seem to have the same watering hole feel as the one downtown."}
{"text":"I am a tiki aficionado and was looking forward to checking this place out. The curb appeal is rather cool outside. Entering the place it does have a real modern feel hence the word in their name. However, I was really really disappointed that there wasn't any tiki type props or decorations anywhere in the restaurant other than the kitschy midcentury props stored inside the bar and the lonely only picture in the entire tiki themed restaurant hidden in the corner - a Mark Ryden print. I just expected a lot more and was told by the bartender that the other central location is better themed so I hope that they're going to make some additions as far as the decor goes . Now we had just eaten at Malee's Thai Room so we didn't sample any of the food items. What we did have was this giant scorpion bowl drink that was strong as heck and tasted awesome - flaming nectar of the gods it was. Bravo! Mr. Bartender. We would have stayed just a little bit longer but there was an extremely intoxicated noisy loud platinum blonde Snottsdale bimbo screeching stupidity right next to my wife's ear so we decided to pack it up after one. I'll make my way down here again and check it out again and maybe downtown too."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times for brunch now and I'm a little shocked that 1) both times this place wasn't very crowded and 2) the $2 mimosas they serve on the weekends isn't something we're talking about more (see 1).  When I lived in San Francisco unlimited mimosa brunches on the weekends were all over the place & I was a little disappointed that they were far and few in between in the Phoenix area when I moved back here (although in the 3+ years I've been back they've been popping up more). Technically, at $2 each Hula's doesn't do an \"unlimited\" mimosa deal, but it's just as good (if not better).   The brunch food menu is pretty solid. The first time I came I had the pork breakfast hash, and it was tasty. Last time I was here I had the omelette (which changes regularly). The time I ordered it, it had chicken & avocado (and a few other things), and it was tasty. This place is also pretty affordable. Most brunch items are around $10 and the portions are pretty good size. Both times I was here the service was good.   The regular Happy Hour & dinner menu look good as well, and they have some pretty fun looking tropical drinks.   I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for the happy hour on a Wednesday night (all day hh starting at 3 PM). Unfortunately they ran out of the ceviche. We ordered two of the shrimp rolls, pork taco, tofu taco, and the poke. We ordered two different drinks each (dark & stormy was one of them). The drinks were very sugary and watered down so that was a little disappointing, especially after reading all the reviews on their drinks. The shrimp rolls were our favorite and the pineapple sauce perfectly complimented / enhanced the flavor of the rolls. The pork taco was full of meat and was our second favorite dish. The sauce that they cooked the meat in was really good. The tofu taco wasn't bad but wasn't as good as the other items. The poke was a little salty and could have used chips or something to balance the flavor.   The food and drinks are 4 stars, but the service was excellent (hence the 5 star rating! It was around 6 PM and there weren't that many tables, but even so, the food and drinks came out LIGHTNING fast. The food was fresh. It didn't seem like it was sitting out for a while, waiting to be ordered. The server was on point with his presence; never overbearing but always there when we needed him. I give the cooks, bartenders, and servers an applause for their service!"}
{"text":"I stopped here with a few friends on an impromptu \"tour de old-town\" before I make my move to SF.  We had no idea it was the grand opening - happy hour all day!  I'd been meaning to try the Phoenix location forever so I was glad I got to check out the new spot.  From what I could tell, this location is much less \"themed\" which is kind of a bummer, but we still got umbrella's in every drink which made me a happy little bar hopper.  We didn't try any food but the drinks we're all very strong and tasty.  One mai tai was enough for this little one, 2 would've sent me dancing across the street at Pattie's.  Definitely a fun new spot to check out for something off the beaten path!"}
{"text":"Ok I'm only giving Hulas 2 stars because our server this morning was terrible! First she brought us coffee and water, and then ignored us for 20 minutes or more. Then she finally took our order and didn't even smile at all and really never spoke to the women at the table. Part of being a server is connecting with your customers.  This young lady might consider this in the future. Lucky for her that one of guys left her a decent tip. I would not have.  All that said the food was really good. The Loco Moco was as good as I had in Hawaii and any place that has Spam on the menu makes me smile. The price was fair and I would come again and hopefully not get our sever. Management you should consider a training"}
{"text":"We had the fish bites appetizer and calamari. If your hungry go for the fish bites. Really good. The calamari comes in strips and there is not a lot to go around. I had the salmon with the macadamia encrusted flavor. Really really good. The prices were fair I thought and had a great atmosphere. I was told I needed to try this place and was not disappointed."}
{"text":"What an awesome place! I feel this place is a hidden GEM for food. Decided to write this review after being pleasantly surprised by another great tasting dish.  I am a big fan of all their protein loaded dishes/bowls. From the Mongolian beef bowl, Spicy Thai chicken, to my favorite the Jawaiian Jerk chicken plate, Jamaican Johnny cakes, an it's mashed potatoes and the plantains.  Just tried the Cajun ahi caesar and that too is amazing. As you can see I'm a big fan of spicy food, so if you are too I HIGHLY recommend it.  Staff here is great too. So far I've been taken care of by Sierra and Max and they are wonderful bartenders. It's also nice to find out that the person bussing your tables might be one of the managers who aren't above bussing tables for customers. All around a great place for food and hospitality!"}
{"text":"I love the black bean burger and sweet potato fries! It's the best \"veggie\" burger that I've ever had. The service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Such a cute Hawaiian feel! Great music and atmosphere . Food is delicious , drinks are cute and yummy. Service was great and friendly. I'll be back for their coconut cream pie!!!! It was to die for !!!"}
{"text":"This place was great.  For me, I've never seen the whole draw to Old Town Scottsale unless you are a senior citizen and needing to buy some crafts and lawn decorations for your backyard.  That or boots and a cowboy hat from the onslaught of craftish type stores out here.    Anyways, stopped in here for lunch and a cocktail a couple days ago and it was great.  Had a glass of \"Josh\" cabernet (because that's my name and I thought it'd be stellar) and a pulled pork sandwich.  The wine was good but the sandwich was great.  It was fresh tasting pulled pork with coleslaw on top with a side caesar salad.  The food was fresh and tasted great and the service was awesome.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this location and I met up with some friends for a quick dinner before we all caught flights out of Phoenix. I wasn't too hungry, so I had a cocktail and the coconut shrimp rolls. The servings here are huge so you could definitely get away with splitting entrees between people. It's a cute place, great for a date night or to catch up with friends over drinks."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are new to Arizona so occasionally we like to step out of our comfort zone and try new places. We decided to try out this place and immediately walking into this restaurant we right away sensed a horrible vibe. The floors were flooded because of the rain (which I slightly understood) so we were only to sit in a specific area. We weren't greeted for a good 5 minutes and when the server did greet us, she seemed mad for whatever reason and we actually had 3 different servers which is annoying and only one server (the manager) actually helped us. The sad part is that I loved my food but my boyfriend didn't enjoy his. He ordered chicken tacos I believe I'm not too sure about the name but his had bones in it which is disgusting and unfortunately the cons out way the pros and we will never be coming back due to our horrible customer service."}
{"text":"The first time I ate here I was with a large group of girls and everything was amazing our service, food and drinks was all great so I recommended it to lots of friends but the second time I ate there it was the complete opposite... Horrific service my good was mediocre and our table was small and we were sat very close to a really big group at a high too and kept getting bumped into"}
{"text":"I'll start with the premise which is a Pro! I wanted to book a large party (15-17 people) for my boyfriend's surprise party. Hula's was incredibly accommodating and kind. I even called earlier that day just to add a couple of chairs and they were able to do it no problem. My boyfriend and I even ran late getting there and the service was still awesome and upbeat.   When I walked in it was kind of a Con. My boyfriend is obsessed with anything Hawaiian which is why I chose Hula's, but when I walked in it seemed more modern and was pretty small. I guess this was my fault for not having gone there before, but I just didn't think it was all that great in terms of a \"Hawaiian\" venue.  Con: I'm a huge foodie and always check out menus before I go to restaurants, so I knew I wanted to start with something small because I wasn't super hungry. I ordered the \"award winning\" ceviche which was INCREDIBLY mediocre. Maybe it was a bad day, but literally ALL I could taste was lime...it was pretty disappointing and too acidic for my stomach. I wasn't really able to finish it because of that, so that was a bit of a waste. My boyfriend ordered the Jamaican Jerk which he also said was pretty mediocre. Everyone else at our table seemed to like their food so we tried to give it another go.  Pro: We both ordered one Polynesian Chicken Sandwich and split it which was actually pretty delicious. I was excited to eat something with real flavor! The sweet potato fries were awesome too. I had forgotten to mention earlier that I ordered the \"Pink Bikini\" drink before food and asked for it in a cute tiki glass which the server did :) The drink was yummy.   Con: It was a bit frustrating with payment because we didn't love our first dishes, but luckily the prices weren't TOO bad. I just felt like we could've saved some money if we had liked our dishes the first time.   Pro: Our server was AMAZING. I wish I remembered her name. I'm super allergic to nuts and she kept asking the kitchen for anything that had nuts in it to make sure I was eating safely. Even when she brought out my boyfriend's complimentary bday ice cream, she forgot it had nuts in it so she separately brought out a plain vanilla which chocolate syrup JUST for me. She was incredibly sweet and helpful and dealt which a large party of tipsy/drunk people by herself. Truly enjoyed the service here.  All in all, this place lost a star because I wasn't super fond of the \"Hawaiian venue\" and the food we initially ordered. Luckily to make up for it, our second dish, my drink, and the service were great. I would try Hula's again if I was in the Scottsdale/Phx area but I probably wouldn't drive out there just to eat like I did the first time."}
{"text":"Been here months ago with my Foodie group. Loved it then and love it now. Doing the Hula for brunch! Amazing Passion Fruit Mimosa and Black Bean Burger with Egg (my touch, of course!). Service remains spot on. And food eclectic and perfectly prepared! Keep up the fantastic work. You rock!!"}
{"text":"Decent food, I always go with a large group from the office so could be the issue but service is always pretty slow. Menu is unique and the ahi salad is very fresh- still enjoy going but not my first choice"}
{"text":"I love Hula's! One of my first restaurants to try in Phoenix. Great seafood and vibe at both locations!"}
{"text":"Loved this place!  Such an eclectic menu and inexpensive for the portions.   The drinks were awesome.  They had all the usual Hawaiian staples such as loco moco and poke and some fusion items as well.  I had at the jerk pulled pork which was out of this world.  The coconut cream pie was also amazing. Dinner for 4 with drinks came out to under $150 which is impressive.  Highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoyed a double date here on a Monday evening. We were sat right away and promptly greeted and offered drink menus.   Our table began with the spicy edamame, which although was a small portion, was delicious. We also had the spicy Thai fish cakes which was a larger serving and had a yummy creamy dipping sauce.   I ordered the Polynesian chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries, both were generous portions and delicious.   My husband ordered the shrimp tacos (3) with Mac and cheese. He's a mac and cheese LOVER and enjoyed it very much.   5/5, great drinks and food!"}
{"text":"Besides the great location in a very cute part of Scottsdale, Hula's had great food!  They were out of the coconut shrimp appetizer, so we got a couple sides to try instead. The Mac Salad (what's Hawaiian food without Mac salad??) was pretty good, but the Wasabi Mashed Potatoes were the best!  For entrees we tried he Baja Fish tacos - nicely breaded whitefish, avocado, cabbage, and fresh limes to squeeze. The salsa that came with it was sweet and spicy. Oh, and it also comes with a scoop of white rice and beans.   We also tried the Luau Pork Sandwich - delicious bread that held up to the sandwich, a pile of shredded pork, coleslaw (it tasted sweet, like pineapples) and a side of sweet potato fries.   The service was fantastic and we really enjoyed our dinner."}
{"text":"This an update from my previous review.  So the owner reached out to me about our bad experience at Hula's for my sons graduation dinner.  He was beyond gracious and I am beyond pleased with his response and accommodations to us.  So while my original review was about service I will say the food is absolutely delicious.  My kids and I could just make a fabulous meal just on the starters.  My favorite is the samurai beef sticks with curry sauce.  The Loco Moco is the best I have had on the Mainland.   The coconut cream pie is divine! Thank You again to the owner for being a very gracious and concerned businessman!"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant twice now and have never been disappointed.  They have a large menu selection with just about something for everyone, and  reasonable prices. The servers are friendly and helpful and quick to get your order to you to enjoy.   The drinks are also great and reasonably priced.  The interior has a modern Hawaiian feel and makes for a nice setting.  Don't plan on coming here with a large party last minute in the evening though, its always busy!"}
{"text":"I always loved Hulas in Phoenix for HH. Was invited to Sunday Brunch at Hulas in Old Town. Was pleasantly surprised no wait. Yay! Was not expecting that. They had Happy Hour drink pricing going on as well. Sweet! I was thirsty so I tried a cranberry mimosa & pineapple mimosa. I love Eggs Benedict & they had a few types to choose from. Benny with Portuguese Sausage caught my eye. Asked the server if was linguisa? She didn't know. I took my chances ordered it and I am glad I did. Delish! It was linguisa. I love linguisa. 3 other pals all tried the Hula Hangover Hash and loved it. Plantains were also ordered and they were great! Brownie/ice cream arrived in a pot with a paper umbrella. Glad we tried it and hope to visit again. Aloha!"}
{"text":"Really loved this place ! Took advantage of the Tuesday after 6 special of two apps and two drinks for $25 - we had shrimp rolls and pot stickers ... so yummm. I had a Dr. Funk and can't remember what the hubs had but we were both very pleased . Music , decor, waitress , entire vibe very casual and funky . Would definitely be a regular if we were from Phoenix ... sigh  but thoroughly enjoyed it till next time !"}
{"text":"Went to dinner on Sunday with my friend. We had stopped in for appetizers a few weeks ago and decided to try something new on the large menu. We were seated very quickly and arrived just in the nick of time to find the restaurant quickly filled up. It is laid out very well to accommodate all sizes of parties. We had the Hawaiian Ceviche which was refreshing and filling. We previously tried the Lobster Bisque which was divine. This time we also had the Fried fish cakes, which were crunchy on the outside and soft in the middle. He had the fried calamari sandwich and I tried the Baja Fish tacos. The Calamari sandwich was amazing. Thin strips were lightly battered and fried, then topped with French dressing and cole slaw. The bun was sturdy enough to hold everything in place and the calamari was very soft and tender. I couldn't believe that it was calamari. I never had a great desire for it because most of the time it is too rubbery and chewy. Not this one! I highly recommend it! The fish tacos were good, 3 of them on corn tortillas with sliced avocado and rice and beans. The rice and beans were nothing special but the tacos filled us up. I would definitely  go back for the Calamari sandwich and to try some other items on the menu. Also, try the Lilikoi Margarita...it is a perfect balance of sweet and sour and half price during happy hour."}
{"text":"Favorite spot in Old Town right now!  I think Hula's has been open for about a month, and I have been there at least 5 times that I can think of!  First of all, I love the décor.  It is very island hip casual, if that makes sense.  I love that there is one wall that completely opens up to the outside.  That has been particularly nice during this mild winter that we've been having.  Second, they have a great happy hour.  It goes until 7 every day.  My favorite are the mai tais.  Usually I am not a huge fan of mai tais, but these are special.  They are not the usual fruit-punch-red, sugary concoctions you get beachside.  No, they are not...but, I have a hard time describing them.  I'll just say they are delicious, and they definitely pack a punch.  Third, almost everything I've eaten there has been great.  The two things that stick out in my mind are the poke and the hapu with lemongrass sauce.  The poke was extremely fresh and flavorful.  Sometimes raw fish dishes are too salty for me, but this was perfect.  My boyfriend ordered the hapu and chose to get it with lemongrass sauce.  It was one of the best fish dishes I've ever had.  Even with a cream sauce, it was relatively light and just really different.  I ordered the butterfish and had it pan fried, and I should have known it would be too much.  It was tasty, but it was just too rich and definitely on the salty side.  I've also had the sweet potato fries, lobster bisque, potstickers, and the crispy coconut shrimp rolls.  I enjoyed all of those except the potstickers, which were too thick and fairly bland.  Finally, the service has generally been good.  The one night I went for dinner rather than happy hour, the service was excellent.  I will be going back to Hula's as soon as possible!"}
{"text":"Went there today because it looked like a fun lunch spot.  It is open air and good music was playing.  I love burgers and I ordered the Hula Burger and it was juicy tasty and plenty big.  The sweet potato fries were the best I've had.  My friend got the Tofu Bowl and really liked it.  It was a big bowl of food so I finished it up for her.  I would go back in a heart beat."}
{"text":"Love this place, nice ambience and great food. Would be nice if there's one in Los Angeles"}
{"text":"I've been to Hula's a couple of times now and am definitely a fan so I figured I'd write a review.  Pros- Really good food, I recommend the Baja Fish Tacos, and the black bean burger- which is quite possibly one of the best veggie burgers I've ever had! I've been here for brunch too and everything is delicious and Hawaiian themed (cute). Also, GREAT cocktails! I came here yesterday for an event and ordered the Blood Orange Martini, YUM! My friend got the Painkiller and that was amazing too.   Cons- Okay so issue number one, it's sort of a weird layout. Near the bar they have two long tables that are parallel to the bar and even though it makes the space look modern and contemporary, I can't help but feel like it's such a waste of space. I get why they have them, for larger groups, but why not connect the booth's that are toward the front? I don't know, but I felt it worth mentioning since everytime I go here with a different person they say the same thing so it must just feel odd to all. Then again, I majored in design as did many of my friends so perhaps we're more sensitive to it then others. Again, this isn't that big of a deal because at the end of the day the food is great so who cares.   Issue number two- okay, how do I say this without sounding like a bitch? Hmm can't. Can the front desk girls please put on real pants? Seriously! Yesterday I saw a girl wearing worn-out yoga clothes and thought \"Really? Who goes to a place like this from Yoga. That's sorta gross.\" Then to my horror I realized the girl actually worked there. WOW. Unlike the layout, you might want to re-think this one, Hula. You're too classy and cool of a place to allow workers to be greeting guests in what could pass as pajamas. Like seriously, bikinis would be less offensive at least that's in line with the theme.   But again, I come here often and really like it. Those are just my humble suggestions to make this place even better."}
{"text":"Love that this place takes reservations, loved the greeter and our waiter - couldn't have been more pleasant or professional, loved the food!  Being in Old Town (aka Tourist Central), I wasn't expecting to love it, and in fact we usually end up at Bandera just for that reason.  So glad we tried Hula's Modern Tiki.  Only drawback is lack of parking which wasn't a problem in the summer of course, but there's no way I'd try to find a parking place there in Season."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots to eat in Scottsdale! Been there 3 times now and it's been perfect every time. I think my favorites so far are the wings- we always get those to start. (My BF and I are wing fanatics and they're yummy here!!) and the Thai chicken bowl.. Omg. I do no cabbage, extra rice and beans and add avocado. YUM. If you like spicy food this is the spot- almost everything has a little kick to it."}
{"text":"This place was good...really good! I can't believe this was my first time there since I always pass by the one on central and go to pita house, which is right across the street from here. It's conveniently located from all the places I enjoy going to.  We started out with blood orange martini's, which were the best martini's I've had to date. It wasn't overly sweet and had the perfect amount of alcohol. Delicious! I got the mac and cheese side and the coconut shrimp rolls. The mac and cheese was good, but not as good as lux of course. The coconut shrimp was ok. I would have liked it more if it had been a little more \"coconutty.\" The girls ordered the fish bites, black beans, sweet plantains, and the spicy sea weed salad. They all loved their food and from what I sampled, everything was on point and delicious. I, especially enjoyed the fish bites. It wasn't too \"fishy\" and was perfectly breaded. All the dishes were almost finished...it was THAT good.   Service was good. Prices were good. Their happy hour seems like it would be good, which I'm pretty stoked to try.   I can't get over that blood orange martini though. Yum!"}
{"text":"Loved this place for the late night drinks and food. With a ton of Hawaiian styled plates the pairings and 2 corse meal options were the best deal. I got the Hawaiian ceviche and fish tacos and they were filling and superb. Also the ahi bowl was large and the seared ahi was perfect. Highly recommend as it is in a great location easy to grab some food."}
{"text":"They were able to accommodate 30 people on a tuesday for a birthday.  I paid on one check to make it easier on them.  However they were a little annoying in requiring all 30 show up before seating us.  I get it but I was gonna pay for everything any ways and with that many people, some are bound to trickle in late.  It did work out fine though.   Food is good. Several vegetarian options for the 3-4 people that don't eat meat.    Food is tasty, island inspired, good quality.  Not extraordinary, but good, and reasonably priced.    Bar is busy with good drinks.  Trendy ambiance and music, which is what I expect in Old town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"It's very hard to see how anyone can be really pleased with Hula's, at least with the Scottsdale location.    The restaurant is modern, clean, and comfortable, but sterile with only the vaguest hints of Hawaii.  The service, for us at least, was polite but uncaring and sometimes inattentive.  And the food was mainly average with an occasionally below average item thrown in.    For example, what they call a Luau platter contains very pedestrian BBQ pulled pork, not luau style at all.  When you bake a pig in an earth over, wrapped in banana leaves, you get the meat that you don't really have to shread because it falls apart.  And you get the whole hog mixed together which adds a complexity of flavors and textures.  With shredded pork shoulder or butt you get pulled pork.  It's not the same thing, and Hula's version is not even a good rendition of pulled pork.  None of the other items was much better, except for the sweet plantains (hard to ruin) and the rice.    Hula's squeaks by with three stars but it could have gotten two for the disappointment."}
{"text":"We try to hit tiki bars wherever we go.   Hula's modern tiki is more of a restaurant-bar,  than a traditional tiki bar.  (Guess that's why they call it modern!)   We had a super happy hour with great cocktails and good appetizers.   At first I thought my painkiller cocktail with a rum float was weak until I started feeling it!   More than worked for me.   Significant other enjoyed his zombie.    We split the coconut shrimp rolls,  curry shrimp,  and pork tacos.  All surprisingly good and reasonably priced.     Service was fun, friendly and fast!     No problem finding a parking, but a lot of that was luck.   Wish Hula's sold more merch!   The staff had cool shirts, tank tops,  hoodies, but none for sale.   So disappointed!   We did buy a really cool double old fashioned glass though.   It was the only thing for sale.    Suggest getting some Hula-wear for the public!"}
{"text":"I have been to Hula's several times, the food is great and the service is awesome (even my mom loves Hula's and she is crazy picky). -Ahi Benedict, the brunch item I didn't realize I was missing...so good. -Hangover Hash, another awesome brunch item that includes their slow roasted pulled pork...wow that stuff is the best. -Spicy Thai Chicken bowl, I find myself thinking about this item often...that sauce needs to be bottled so I can stop thinking about how delicious it would be on everything. If you find yourself on 1st Ave in the afternoon and smell something amazing, yeah that's Hula's. I tell everyone to go there when visiting Old Town!"}
{"text":"Food was great! We had Poke, potstickers and steak tacos. All were yummy! Can't wait to come back and try more!"}
{"text":"This was our 1st stop on Friday before hitting the old towne night scene for a girls night out. One of da girls recommended we have dinner here as she had been here before. We started with the fish bites.. Yezzzz please and yummmm, they were so good I ordered them for my \"dinner\" along with the beef kabobs (?) appetizer. Both were delish however I may be addicted to the fish bites! Mike our waiter was cool and very helpful as far as what to order. Da girls ordered steak tacos and the ahi poke. We all enjoyed every bite of our food. Portions are large!   Vibe was nice and people seemed to be enjoying themselves. We got there around 7 ish and the place was already hopping. We sat at the long table which we shared with a bunch of other people who were in groups. Overall we really enjoyed our experience and definitely will return."}
{"text":"This is hands down one of my favorite places to eat solely because of their Spicy Thai Chicken dish. I don't even like spicy or Thai food --- but PLEASE try this plate at LEAST once. It's their most popular item and I haven't ordered anything except the Spicy Thai Chicken since I started going there. Thank you Hula's for having one of the best meals I've ever tasted.  I also highly recommend their Dr. Funk alcoholic beverage. It is served in the coolest Tiki cup AND it's delicious. Get ready for some tasty Malibu rum on their speciality drink menu!"}
{"text":"We had the crispy coconut shrimp rolls as an appetizer and the Dr Funk beverage and both were fabulous!!! Our waiter Tyler was the best! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Super impressed by this place! Very cool ambience and decor. A modern tiki themed restaurant. No Hawaiian music, modern day pop.  The cocktails were amazing. I recommend the Hawaii Five-0 and the mai tai. I got the blackened wasabi red snapper meal with wasabi mash potatoes and macaroni salad in place of the vegetable. Swear to God best fish I've had in years! If I could make one tiny complaint it would be that the portion of fish was pretty small but other than that great experience and super quick service. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Dropped by Hula's while strolling around Old Town Scottsdale.  The fiancé and I were looking for a place to have dinner and we came across what looked like a hip and happening place.  Honestly a bit out of place in my opinion considering that Hula's is this \"modern tiki bar\" right in the heart of this western old town scottsdale area but nonetheless we decided to try this place out.  Hula's had quite an extensive menu with so many items to choose from I was a bit overwhelmed but our very trendy sweet server Alexis recommended their spicy Thai chicken bowl and their fish plates.  We decided to try both.  I ordered the Thai chicken bowl minus the beans and the fiancé ordered the lemongrass encrusted hapu.  I was really disappointed because we originally wanted to order the butterfish but they were out but Alexis mentioned that the hapu would be another alternative option.  The fish was absolutely delicious!  Light and flakey and just every bit of perfection!  I loved it!  Very much comparable to one of my favorite restaurants I frequent in San Diego for Hawaiian fusion dishes!  YUM!  The portions here are pretty hefty as my Thai chicken bowl was huge! Definitely could feed at least two I think because I can eat for two!  Prices here are reasonable for dinner ranging anywhere from 7-26.     A great date place since the lighting is so dim it really sets the mood haha however I saw tons of families and children dining here.  Would definitely come back the next time I visit Scottsdale and recommended others to try Hula out."}
{"text":"This place has great HH bites . . . and unique drinks! When you are looking for something a little bit different and are really tired of the green-chile-chips-and-salsa route, try Hula's for a change of pace. Relaxed and laid back just like the Pacific islands, Hula's Modern Tiki is a place to wind-down and have some great food. The best thing about this place, even beyond the great food, is the service. Wonderful! Everyone made us feel like they were truly happy that, of all the Old Town choices, we had selected Hula's.   Parking is a bear unless you get there early . . .  but that just gives you longer to enjoy Happy Hour!"}
{"text":"We've had a number of great experiences at Hula, most recently last night with our daughter. The friendly wait staff and greeters are always on hand to answer questions and insure you are having a fun time. They have a number of tropical drinks that are fun to try as well as good wine and beer. Last night we had fish dishes that came out with perfection. We asked to substitute the sides and that was no problem. I asked that my fish just be lightly grilled, again no problem. On weeknights hubby and I love walking over and having a couple of glasses of wine and appetizers during happy hour (they have great specials) and sitting near the bar. Fun atmosphere, casual but a great dining experience! Give it a try!"}
{"text":"The tuna poke is fantastic. Do yourself a favor and order this with some wonton chips to start.   Also, have had Juan Carlos as a server multiple times. He is fantastic and will make sure you have everything you need.    Great drink specials and amazing Mac and cheese"}
{"text":"This place is definitely one of my favorite places! The food is so good! I would definitely recommend the sweet potato fries with their dipping sauce because they were absolutely amazing. I also got the cajun ahi tuna caesar salad and ohhhhh my goodness! It was amazing!! Their drinks are so good and some of them even come in cute little tiki glasses, which is always fun. My server on one occasion wasn't super friendly, but maybe it was just a bad day. I came on another occasion and my server was awesome! While this place is a little pricey, it's definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Love this place! Cute and fun atmosphere and great management! Every Wednesday is all day happy hour - you have to try the tacos!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this gem in Downtown Old Scottsdale! Cute artsy area that is great to walk around and see unique shops. Easy street parking, small private lot, or a structure a couple blocks away. The restaurant has such a fun, young and hip vibe. The cuisine has a Asian-Hawaiian flair. Awesome happy hour with a lot of tropical Hawaiian mixed drinks and appetizers. (Blood orange martini on the rocks is highly suggested)  Our waiter Jharnys was THE BEST! He was so inviting and friendly.. he gave honest suggestions on the menu while still being tactful and personable.   We ordered calamari as an appetizer. This was such a unique way to serve calamari but was pleasantly surprised. As entrées: spicy seaweed salad, pork stuffed potstickers, hapu blackened wasabi fish, steak tacos... ALL were amazing. We cleaned every plate. There were zero complaints. To finish it off we capped this great meal with the delicious key lime pie. Wow it seems like you can't go wrong with anything on the menu!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, right across the road from patties in oldtown its perfect to start the night and the open air theme is cool. The service was really interactive and relaxed and our server had lots of knowledge on the vast menu. It was hard to pick there were so many tasty options. Added bonus was happy hour until 7pm saturday and sunday.  I was recommended to try hulas for the drink menu and it didn't disappoint! I had the tiki bastard and it was so good! A twist on the traditional mule. Plus the drinks are all served in fun glassware so you feel like your drinking cocktails on the beach. To eat I had the thai chicken bowl which was huge and judging from some of the portions coming from the kitchen they serve big, but really tasty and nice presentation. My friends had the pork tacos and the cheviche and both were delicious, one of the best ceviche I have had in AZ.  Cool place to hang out and enjoy the atmosphere, I would definitely be back to try more!"}
{"text":"Good happy hour prices. Tasty appetizers. Beers are a little flat. Get a mixed drink."}
{"text":"The calamari appetizer is one of the best I've had in Arizona. If you like ahi tacos, you're in for a treat with these. They don't skimp on the tuna and the chili-lime aioli adds a great flavor.   The music is always on point although seating is tight. Staff loves to put people right next to each other even if there are open seats elsewhere."}
{"text":"Good was so good, had the pulled pork sandwich along with a Caesar salad and key lime pie for dessert ... What wasn't the best was the waiter . He seemed to be working the bar along with taking tables .. He also seemed side tracked and he wasn't rude but he wasn't overly happy to see us either ... A little over priced but I may go back one day ."}
{"text":"Came in late night for a drink and a snack with a friend. We each got beers and ordered the coconut shrimp egg rolls. Oh man, those egg rolls and the pineapple dipping sauce were SO good! Will be back for those for sure!!"}
{"text":"Five stars for the happy hour. Great apps for $6 and all the cocktails are $5. Can't go wrong. Favorite was the beef skewers with pineapple. If you're looking for a fun little happy hour spot this is it"}
{"text":"Such a unique restaurant! Try the modern fish sandwich it's AMAZING. Also, if able indulge in a Mai Tai. Be warned though, you will become angry when you realize you're drinking this wonderful tropical drink in the middle of the desert   One of my favorite spots in old town! It's a must visit!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal food and service!! Environment was spectacular especially at night. Jharnys was our waiter, he suggested great menu items, and was very attentive to detail. I had specific diet requirements and he followed them to a T. The food was delicious and the prices were GREAT!!"}
{"text":"Since we found out about this place last year we've come another 10 or so times. I love the Mai Tais, which have a nice lime bite as opposed to being overly sweet like you get some places. I haven't had too many of the actual entrees, but the apps are delicious (Especially the coconut shrimp rolls, and the Poke w/ the wonton chips) and the all night happy hour on wednesday is pretty sweet, especially considering the \"weight\" of the drinks. A nice, tasty buzz for a good value, even more so since it's in $cottsdale. Keep it up Hula!"}
{"text":"clean environment - small parking lot but we got lucky and found a prime spot near the door - decor is modern upscale Hawaiian style (not ur usual casual hawaiian eating spot)  food presentation is great - tasty but can't believe they were out of plantains by lunchtime! that's insane! LOL   loco moco was done very well. the ahi poke was delicious as well. I would pass on the ceviche- too much lime - over powered the dish.  staff is friendly enuff - good service and clearing of dirty plates  not a lot of diversity in the guests during our visit"}
{"text":"After the waiter described the loco moco, it seems like it will taste delicious. However, they ran out of eggs on that day. So sad!! =( The hula burger tasted alright, nothing that special. All the tacos tasted pretty good (south sea fish tacos, pork tacos and shrimp tacos). The spicy Thai chicken bowl tasted mediocre and I didn't like the sauce that much. The Hawaiian Mac salad tasted like the cold pasta salad. The tropical ice tea tasted like any other ice tea. Overall, this place is only alright."}
{"text":"So when your Mother-In-Law lives in Honolulu, you tend to spend a LOT of time on the Island. And I can tell you with all certainty that Hula's Modern Tiki may be located in Scottsdale, but its heart and soul is in Hawaii!   I popped in on my own while the \"men folk\" were out swinging metal clubs at tiny balls in the searing Arizona sun; so I sat up at the bar (which is always the right choice when you are on your own.) The bartender was super friendly and so terrific. She made some recommendations, we chatted wine, she even let me sample the utterly terrible pineapple wine (lol, seriously, it's not good - sorry Hawaii) but it is fun to try!  They have a great menu with lots of fun Island-life staples like poke, mahi, hapu, and ahi. There are bowls, burger and sandwiches and of course tacos (this is still AZ!) and even a dish in tribute to Duke. I decided to get the Polynesian chicken sammie that came with grilled chicken with a light teriyaki glaze topped with spiced pineapple and sun-dried tomato pesto aioli. It was aaaaah-mazing! And to take it to the next level (and I HIGHLY recommend doing this), I subbed my fries for fried sweet plantains. So good!! All this paired with a traditional Hawaiian cocktail like a Dark & Stormy or Mai Tai, and you will swear you can hear the waves crashing on a nearby shore... Honestly, the only thing missing is the beach. Mahalo!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Hula's before, being a local of Scottsdale, and the food is okay. However after my most recent trip, I won't be returning to this location again. The restaurant wasn't nearly as busy as some of the surround restaurants, and when we walked in the waitress (without acknowledging us at all) placed us at the table. We had plenty of time to review the menu before I stated to noticed that two couples that had been seated after us had already been waited on. Multiple staff members walked past our tables as we had now clearly folded up our menus and were now ready to order. We weren't even offered water!!! After sitting for 20 minutes at the table, clearly looking around for someone to at least take our drink order, we left.  What upset me the most was the hostess. The hostess stand has a bar directly behind it where she was rolling napkins with tableware and has visibility to all of the tables. She just stood there and watched us be ignored. Multiple wait staff approached her to ask questions and she never directed anyone to assist us. I get it, maybe none of them were supposed to wait on our table, but lady you sat us there. Why had you not checked to see why we weren't waited on? I'm incredible offended being blatantly ignored. So save yourself the trip and the Scottsdale attitudes and go someone actually worth your time."}
{"text":"Awesome place to meet up with friends for some drinks and food!  I love the downtown location and as soon as I heard there would be a location in Scottsdale, I was thrilled.  Same great concept, same excellent food and service.  The sweet potatoes and taco plates are amazing.  The taco plates come with one or two tacos, and beans and rice.  Brunch is my favorite time to stop in.  The Chef's Choice Omelet is my favorite.  They do have coffee but I would highly recommend getting a double Pineapple Mimosa.  As for other favorite drinks, try the the Dark & Stormy or the Pain Killer.  But all the drinks are worth trying!  They have all day Happy Hour on the Weekends and Wednesday.  Stop by and say hi to Max."}
{"text":"This is a really neat [tiny] place in Old Town that I can't wait to return to. An alumni association I'm apart of from college decided to do a happy hour here and it was so much fun! I felt like I was in Key West or Rocky Point with the festive drinks and decor. One of the girls set a reservation ahead of time and that was an absolute Godsend, otherwise I couldn't imagine us sitting anywhere. We had a large portion of the bar-top table set aside for us, and we actually needed more! I felt bad for the group of 5 who was seated immediately next to us as after awhile they moved down because we had no more space to squish people in.   Our server was fabulous and made rounds every so often to make sure everyone was doing ok or needed to order something. Definitely take advantage of the happy hour [all-day on Wednesdays!] because the food and drink specials can't be beat. I went with the Hurricane to start, and tried no other drinks the rest of the evening because it was SOOOO GOOD! I think everyone in the group had fun with the drinks alone since they were served in fun glasses. If you need some bites for happy hour, definitely go with the sweet potato fries and wings. Each order can probably serve 2-3 people depending on hunger level."}
{"text":"LOVE this spot. I try something different each time I go here and everything is amazing. The drinks are delicious and their specials put the cherry on top! I would recommend this place to anyone looking for fresh food with unique flavors. Plus their service is always 10/10."}
{"text":"I came here with a large group and our service was quick for a friday night. We sat at the communal tables near the doors, which was nice. I got their chicken burger with a grilled pineapple and it's a MUST. The chicken was juicy and the pineapple added an amazing savory taste. Drinks are priced well for the area and they were strong. My friend got their beef tacos and she said it was great. Get the mac and cheese as a side, you won't regret it I promise!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times before for lunch and dinner but I had no idea this place was such a great spot for brunch. They have a really unique brunch menu, a few items containing pulled pork. Pulled pork and eggs surprisingly work well together. Hula's also has a great happy hour special.  If you are not up for adult bevs early in the day, they also have tropical iced tea (not listed on the menu).  I highly recommend the tea, it's very refreshing! Not only is the food good, but so is the service."}
{"text":"Great happy hour special on Tuesday! 2 n 2 for $20! We shared 2 apps and 2 cocktails! Great cocktails, fresh seafood!"}
{"text":"Always great food and drinks. We've been here a lot... so so consistent and yummy.  The atmosphere  is awesome and the service is always great too."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the food here & we returned many times during our stay in AZ with our friends for the \"strong & Limey\" Mai Tai's!!! My husband's new fav cocktail. Friendly knowledgeable staff, fun atmosphere & crowd!!! Open-Air Arizona greatness"}
{"text":"Not a bad spot. I was in for a late lunch and it was pretty quiet. I bet it's a fun place when it's packed. The staff were great and the service was fast. I had the ceviche for a starter which was excellent. The main a Thai rice bowl was ok. The only thing Thai about it was the look. I'll try it again for sure. 3.5 stars would make me feel better."}
{"text":"I am pretty obsessed with this place.  Food is off the hook, fun drinks and great atmosphere!!!"}
{"text":"Came here after hiking Camelback Mountain. The place looked pretty new, definitely well-maintained with a very modern style/layout. Arrived towards lunchtime and were able to find a seat pretty quickly.  The fish tacos were excellent and the Zombie drink was solid. A little strong for my taste, but was made well.  Staff were attentive and accommodating. I feel like this would be a great spot for brunch, so we will have to come back again!"}
{"text":"I'm not happy leaving a negative review on such a great place, but gotta be honest here.  One big factor here;  I was super hungry! I mean, really hungry \"I could eat a whole cow\" hungry.  I had high expectations for this place but was not satisfied. I ordered one of the bowls Mongolia beef over rice and salad to go. Waited 15-20 mins for it, plus a small drink and total came to $16 plus tip final bill $20. Walked out and rushed back to the office and savoring the meal and how I'm gonna devour this big plate weighing at least 2 pounds.  I get to the office so excited to kill this plate. I took out the plate, opened it and BOOM! There I counted 4 small pieces of beef and the whole plate filled with chopped salad and lots of rice on the bottom. At this point, I'm thinking...I just spent $20 on food that wont fill me up, drove 10 mins to the place, waited 15-20 mins for the food and another 10 mins back to the office and all I got was 4 lousy SMALL pieces of beef? Come on man, I'm hungry here! (Now annoyed)  Anyways, took me 15 maybe 20 seconds to eat all 4 pieces with some rice and salad and the rest of the 1.7 pounds of rice and salad left(exaggerating) went to the trash.    I was still hungry and went and bought a $4 burrito, no tip, lots of steak in it and filled me right up. So in one day, I spent 1 hour and $24 just to fill myself up for lunch. I think that might be a record in my books. I would try this place again but it will not be anytime soon.    Larry"}

{"text":"Great atmosphere. Got in early on a weekend and there was no wait. Very good food. Sweet potato fries were the best!"}
{"text":"I'd been wanting to try this spot out for awhile but had put it on hold since my fiancé hadn't liked Hawaiian dishes he'd tried in the past. It just so happened that we found ourselves searching for a late night meal in Scottsdale and stumbled into Hula's.  First of all, as a mid century style buff, I loved the whole vibe going on inside. Hawaiian mod style with a few new age touches made for a pretty sweet and swanky setting.   I went with the fried fish bites app and a side of fries. Given the price point of the fish app (~$8-9), i fully expected the portions to be pretty small.. However the fish pieces were huge! My fiancé and I both could not come close to finishing them. Not only were the portions impressive for the price, but they tasted amazing! You could tell that they had just been battered and fried minutes beforehand. The side of fries were also just out of the deep fryer and were super yummy.  My fiancé went with the Jawaian Jerk Chicken plate which he said was quite possibly the best meal he's had since we moved to Arizona 6 months ago. I tried bites of the chicken and Johnny cakes and wow, I have to agree!   Service was great, ambience was awesome, and the food was outstanding.. Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Where to start? For a foodie, who loves VALUE too, this place is a 5**. I found it thru yelp, when I was driving half mile away.  It sounded intriguing, so I went for it. Boy am I glad I did! It was early (on a Friday night), so it wasn't yet crowded. Service was excellent (cute boys too!), but the food was amazing -for the price, and very very good for ANY price! Place was super clean (even the bathroom) and decorated very cute.  The portions were, for me, PERFECT! I hate to leave feeling hungry; but I hate getting so much I feel stuffed trying not to waste it. The portions and pricing was right on! The sea bass was cooked PERFECTLY (an I'm hard to please on that). 99% of restaurants OVERCOOK the fish. Not here. Tender, succulent, and the Blackened Wasabi that I chose was awesome.  The broccoli rabe was cooked perfectly too, and the wasabi mashed potatoes, well...I almost NEVER eat mashed potatoes. I ate every morsel!  I WILL be back. And I'm gonna tell all my friends to GO!  Gesh, maybe I should get a job here, huh?   (:  You will NOT be sorry...  PS Picture of Blackened wasabi fish is somewhere uploaded  on site..."}
{"text":"Wonderful friendly atmosphere and I have seen the service improve over the past year. It seems to be quicker & more attentive now. The food is always very consistent and cooked to perfection. Prices are very fair for what you get and seems like some drink is always on special. And of course the pulled pork is really \"heaven on a bun\"!"}
{"text":"Never disappointed when I eat here. The food is excellent! My favorite is the thai chicken bowl, and their plantains are drool worthy. Service can be hit or miss but over all, I really enjoy this place!"}
{"text":"Such a cool little place! Came out here on a Friday night and was able to get a table right away which was really awesome. The cocktails here are amazing and if you're able to come during happy hour, it's even better. I had the Hula burger which was better than I was expecting but the best part of my meal was hands down the sweet potato fries. Whatever you're getting here, get the sweet potato fries. You won't regret it. Highly recommend checking this place out whether it's for a few drinks or for dinner. It's awesome!"}
{"text":"I've been to the Hula's in downtown Phoenix several times but I only seem to order drinks there and eat someplace else.  I've always loved the atmosphere at Hula's and the cocktails so when the new location opened up in Scottsdale, my friend and I decided to eat dinner there before hitting the town.  The location is great and has a small, very small, private parking lot.  Be weary if you park there about backing out.  Seating was varied with some booth/table set ups, small 2 person tables, bar seating and high top \"communal\" or large group seating.  There were a couple parties going on and it was still comfy for everyone.  What we ordered: - Island Style Poke: about $14 on my bill (market price) with a side of wontons ($1) was just fantastic.  Loved it, almost didn't want to share it with my friend. - Seaweed Salad: $4 - great portion, great dressing, just great.  I will order there every time I'm there from now on. - Blackand Ahi Tuna Sandwhich with a mix of sweet potato fries and standard fries: I could not get enough of this sandwhich.  The bread choice was fantastic.  It was soft enough that made it easy to bite into the Ahi.  The seasoning was great, and the potatoes were perfect.   My friend got the Mango Chicken Caesar Salad:  It was a huge salad, with a chicken breast.  I haven't had blackened chicken in a while, so I was surprised that it was spicy.  Really tasty though, just FYI.  The waiter was attentive and the staff was really nice.  I would definitely come back for dinner again."}
{"text":"My friend loves the orange vodka drink on happy hour.  I usually drink wine.   Happy hour is the best time to come.  Otherwise, it's a bit overpriced.   The ceviche is the best on the app menu....everything else is less than \"meh\".   I've not had the ahi so I can't comment.  Market price?   Whatever.   But, the ceviche is the best in the valley.  Totally worth regular price even :).   For dinner, mango chicken caesar salad was yum.   Service is usually decent.  Except if you sit at the bar."}
{"text":"Amazing happy hour but get there early as they fill up quickly. Also try the drink \"painkiller\" its pretty good."}
{"text":"Great service by Lee! Interesting and varied cocktail list. Inexpensive. Yummy food. First time there and likely to return. Had the crispy shrimp roll and Hawaii 5-0 cocktail."}
{"text":"This place was great and as most places go, the appetizers are the best part. We had the samurai beef sticks and ceviche for appetizers- amazing!  The crispy chips they serve with the ceviche are just ok but the actual ceviche is so wonderful it doesn't matter!  The beef sticks are a kabab with pineapple and green onions and a curry sauce- OMG, so good. Mai tai was wonderful- not too sweet, just right. Entrees were good too, but not the best part. Luau pork was good -came with plain rice and plain slaw. The jerk pork was good and came with a dry zucchini type bread and really great plantains. Service was FANTASTIC!  I would definitely go back. It's always fun to try different places."}
{"text":"The Dr Funk, a mai-tai, a punch bowl, and maybe another of their rum drinks are the reasons to go here.  The rum drinks are good, fun, & consistent.   The menu may be island inspired, but its simple & boring, on the verge of bland.   Hula's is a nice place to stop in for a quick drink or as part of a bar crawl thru Scottsdale as there are many other watering holes in walking distance of each other in this area.  Service is ok, pricing is on par for what they offer. But the comfort level in this place is a little weird, this isnt the place to have several cocktails & get sloppy.  Thats what Pattie's is for across the street."}
{"text":"Good spot for breakfast, lunch, happy hour and/or dinner. This place is easy to get seated and get in and out of fast for breakfast which is rare in Old Town. We also love the dinner menu. Spicy Thai Chicken Bowl is our favorite. Had my birthday dinner there last year and they do a great job of accommodating medium/large groups."}
{"text":"Our favorite restaurant in Scottsdale! Cool Hawaiian vibe, delicious fish, excellent drinks! Our waiter forgot a kids meal, probably because she didn't write anything down when taking 5 peoples orders, but instead made up for it by rushing it out for us. It arrived a few minutes later and all was well! Wasabi mash had some good kick to it and the ceviche was a perfect appetizer on a warm Scottsdale evening! I look forward to returning to Scottsdale and will definitely be back here if we can get in!"}
{"text":"My Mama and I had plans to go out to dinner last Friday night but couldn't decide where to go. So, I did some googling and got on Yelp and we decided to try this restaurant.  When we got there we were immediately taken in by the open, well decorated, and well lighted space. In addition the community seating was a fun addition. However, we got seated at a quiet table for two.  Our server couldn't have been more engaging, fun, or knowledgeable about the menu. He suggested the Hawaiian short ribs for my mother and the mahi-mahi Hula styled for me. Both dishes were beyond incredible!   At the end of the meal we were given a card to fill out regarding the food and service. We gave both categories top marks and my mom wrote on the back of the card \"WE LOVE JOE, AND YOUR RIBS!\"  I went up to the front to ask the hostess if I could speak to the manager regarding our experience and she turns around, points and says \"Joe is the manager.\" We'd been served by the manager himself and he never identified himself or made himself seem above the task. She then showed him the card we'd filled out and he laughed and wanted at us with a big smile as we left.  That is an extremely rare occurrence and made us even more thrilled we'd chosen to spend our evening at Hula's.  If you are in the area and want a unique and delicious experience, definitely give Hula Tiki's a try. You will not regret it!   If you can, even request Joe as your server and it will make your dinner even more fabulous!!!"}
{"text":"I went there the first time this past Wednesday evening with a group. The ambiance is great. We all raved about our food individually however my favorite was the ISLAND STYLE POKE* raw ahi, soy sauce, sesame oil, avocado, onions, macadamia nuts. It was on the starter menu but It could easily be a meal for one and it was amazing. For dinner two of us split the JAWAIIAN JERK PORK PLATE slow roasted pulled pork, jerk sauce, plantains, rice, mango salsa, jamaican johnny cakes which was yummy. I am not too much of a rice fan, so I ordered the Wasabi mashed potatoes. They were good, however I recommend more wasabi. On Wed it's happy hour drinks and happy food menu all night long a nice perk.   My only recommendation would be is cut down on your menu items. Too much food to choose from and too many drinks as an option. Although the drink names are cool and the drinks look awesome it gets over whelming for the customers to make a choice. Just think of all the money that could be saved if the restaurant cut down on its menu. I will be back...."}
{"text":"Not sure where all the great reviews are coming from. This place was average at best. The decor is nice and the staff were somewhat friendly but beyond that the food was certainly edible but not outstanding. If I were visiting Scottsdale again, I would say there are much better places to spend your food budget on."}
{"text":"This is a cute place in the middle of the old town shops. I'd say the cuisine is American with some Hawaiian flair. I went with a group and we were able to get something that pleased each of our palates. They have everything from simple burgers to tangy ceviche. What I really liked was their plantain chips. They didn't have the oily \"just took them off the fryer\" taste. Maybe they bake them?"}
{"text":"Came in with a group of 5, wanting dinner and drinks. We live near Old Town and frequent many of the local establishments on a regular basis. This was the first time here. Although there were quite a few places to sit and a near empty bar, it took several minutes to be greeted by a hostess, two of them were too busy talking to each other to acknowledge us. We were eventually seated and the service was lackluster. We ordered our food and when it came one of the dishes was incorrect. OK, stuff happens, but when my friend told the waiter her order was wrong, he argued with her, saying he remembered distinctly what she ordered. But he was wrong. He hadn't written the order down and was simply wrong. He huffed and took the plate back, remarking once again that she had ordered it. The rest of us were served, and eventually she was brought her food by a different server. He said, \"Lucky for you we weren't too busy or you would have had to wait a lot longer.\" That did it. We won't be back, and it's too bad. The food and the drinks are good. I tipped 18% on the $84.00 bill, but I shouldn't have. There are too many fine choices in Old Town. I expect to be treated with some modicum of respect."}
{"text":"Outstanding! My entire family loved their meals. We had fish encrusted with lemongrass, steak and pork tacos, and Jamaican jerk chicken. Even the side salad was so good. Finale was the coconut cream pie to die for. Different than the typical restaurants recommended and a must try."}
{"text":"Great food AND beer, what more could you ask for? Great spot to grab dinner with some friends or on a date night."}
{"text":"First timer here, parking was not that bad for the area. The food was really good! Table service was fast overall good time on the run!"}
{"text":"I love their Downtown location and when I heard about the new location in Old Town Scottsdale I just about flipped.  Being very familiar with their downtown menu (especially their signature drinks) I came in to see how (or if ) this place could really hold its own relative to the Downtown Phoenix location.    Hands down, this Hula's is just as good as the Downtown location.  While the ambiance is different between the two locations, the food and drink are consistent.   I have a few favorites that have carried over from the Downtown location.  Drinks - While every one their signature drinks is *AWESOME* [yep have worked my way through that list a few times at the #dtphx location] my favorite is the Dr. FuNk, followed closely by their Mai Thai and Pain Killer.  It's easy to slurp down these luscious libations, especially while enjoying the lovely Arizona weather.  But be warned, you will want to have a DD, Tipsy Tow or your favorite taxi/driver service on speed dial. It sneaks up on you!  As soon as you stand up, after only 2-3 drinks, you will be wondering if someone slipped you a \"mickie\". Potent stuff!  To help off-set the effects of the multiple Mai-Thais.  Their food is absolutely yummy.  While I have not tried everything on their food menu, what I have tried is delish. Food...  [MY top 3] Their Hula Burger with sweet potato fries (that fry sauce they serve with the sweet potato fries is very tasty.)  Or just order the fries an order is large enough to share if you are just looking for something to munch on. - Ceviche - chunks of white fish marinated in citrus juice tossed with cilantro. red bell pepper, chopped tomato...It is served with wonton chips. Great to share but I like to make a light meal out of it.  - Ahi wontons- wonton chips topped with a thin slice of seasoned and seared ahi tuna (it 's rare for those squeamish about their fish) drizzled with a light wasabi aoli of sorts. This, like the ceviche, is good to share or makes a great light meal.  Ahi Poke Salad- chunks of ahi (raw) mixed with avocado and served with wonton chips.  I treat this the same as the last two dishes listed above.   The Scottsdale location is the first place where I tried their Jamaican Johnny Cakes (Side Order = 6 pieces) - the way they do it here,  think of this as a buttery sweet and earthy corn bread. Served warm it accompanies any of their pulled pork or bowls well. I just like it by itself.   Plus it is a great way to soak up a little of the booze and maintain your composure.  Ok that is enough...you probably didn't make it this far down the review or you did, but only after reading the first 3 sentences."}
{"text":"Both the service and food were amazing. Absolutely delicious food with friendly and professional staff made our late lunch a wonderful experience. The design of the restaurant is very modern and comfortable."}
{"text":"Such a terrific environment! I love the idea of the word of the day.. Definitely try the Dr. Funk! We had the Mongolian Beef Bowl, Salmon (lemon encrusted) and the Bali Ribs.. Oh! Try the Coconut Shrimp rolls! Our server was terrific and patient! Service was prompt.. the slaw was even good! I'm super particular about slaw too! Definitely a fan! Next time I'm going to try some tacos, yo!"}
{"text":"What's better than happy hour from 3-11pm on a Wednesday night? Not much! Hula's happy hour on Wednesday makes happy hour during the week possible for everyone. Their pork tacos and crispy coconut shrimp rolls are finger lickin' good. My personal favorite on their entire menu is their abalone style calamari which I like to refer to as their grilled calamari. I crave it all the time! It comes with an amazing lime-ginger cream sauce that compliments the calamari perfectly.   Their brunch menu is also fantastic, I recommend the Hangover Hash, which if you do actually have a hangover, works magic. Otherwise it's just plain delicious. Hula's atmosphere is fun and a nice change of pace for us Arizonans."}
{"text":"First timers here.  A pretty dark place.  We couldn't read our menu well and used a cell phone flashlight to see the menu.  The food was good... We loved the quick service,  and very friendly staff.  I ordered a side of beans but were not seasoned.  I loved their peanut sauce that came with the chicken sticks. The chicken was quite tender and not dry and overcooked.  The shrimp tacos were great!"}
{"text":"There's nothing about the interior of this place that says \"Polynesian.\" Nor will you feel like you are in the South Pacific which is the feeling that a Tiki bar is supposed to get across.  Hula's looks pretty much the same as every other Old Town Scottsdale restaurant. The fact that they have \"Tiki\" in their name is a joke."}
{"text":"Amazing happy hour- island inspired drinks and dishes. Daily specials including word of the day. Service is excellent, venue is trendy. Indoor and outdoor seating. The mai tai was amazing and strong! The coconut shrimp spring roll- as delicious as it sounds. We also had the beef sticks, wings, and a few other apps! A must try in the heart of Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Was being a tourist in Old Town Scottsdale and then hunger started to get the best of me.  My girlfriend and I went to a Mexican place across the street but they didn't open until 11:00 AM.   I asked if they could recommend a place and the young lady said that Hula's was really good.  Once there, I ordered a martini and  my girlfriend had a bloody Mary.  My martini was made from scratch and was very delicious.  I managed to take a sip of the bloody mary only to discover that it was also made from scratch and not from a mix.    After my drink, I ordered French toast.  Very fluffy and delicious.  The portion was generous and I left Hula's full.  A great place if you're in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Since my friend loves rum infused drinks we decided to come here for bites on a Saturday afternoon. I'm not into fruity drinks with fluffy umbrellas on them but my friend loved every drink they ordered the crispy coconut shrimp egg rolls. Everything was delicious. I can see myself come back on a Friday and Saturday night to enjoy more of the scene."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner late on a Monday night.  The restaurant was pretty empty and we were seated immediately.    We ordered drinks (hurricane and painkiller) and were impressed -- take a sip, close your eyes, and the flavors will transport you to the beach.  For an appetizer we ordered the Hawaiian Ceviche (made with hapu).  Awesome ceviche - the addition of coconut milk was different, but amazing.  I've ordered hapu when in Hawaii, but rarely see it named on a menu here.  I am a fan of its buttery texture and mild flavor, so I was excited to see it as a staple on the menu.  Dinner was a different story.  I ordered the CocoJoe's Chicken Plate.  The chicken was very rubbery.  Had the meat been good, the whole dish would have been awesome, but when the main attraction on the plate is bad... :-(  In hindsight, I should have sent it back.  Instead, I picked at it.  My friend ordered the Shrimp Tacos.  She was drawn in by a word in the description: spicy.  Unfortunately, the dish was absolutely not spicy.  We joked that we should have stopped after our appetizer.  I will give Hula's another try one of these days.  Luau pork or a hapu fish sandwich perhaps... definitely more drinks and ceviche."}
{"text":"Happy hour was amazing. Great prices for drinks and tons of tasty food items.  Service was great. I forget the gentleman working behind the bar, but he was on point. Food came fast and was delicious and the drinks were cold.  Great place and great people. Definitely a for sure spot in old town."}
{"text":"We stop in here every visit to the Phoenix area.  Just love the food and the atmosphere.  Drinks are excellent and the staff is always friendly.  The Phoenix location has much more outdoor seating so we kind of like that location better but this location has the food and drinks we crave.  Just a very comfortable and fun place to hang out with excellent eats."}
{"text":"So when I heard Hula's was opening another location (thank you Yelp!) I knew I had to be there for the Grand Opening. Turns out so did quite a few other people! Hula's is a very popular place. With good reason. Killer drinks, great ambiance and the food is just like it is at the Phoenix location. This is a really fun place to hang out. Just awesome!  For food this time I tried something different. I opted for the Fish Sandwich, with  blackened hapu, taco slaw, sun-dried tomato pesto aioli. It's huge! (Served with way too many fries.) And yet, I continued to eat well past my filling point.   Here's why. The sandwich melted in my mouth. It was spiced, but not hot! hot! hot! burn the place down. Just enough kick to keep things interesting. If I hadn't planned to paint the town red I could have readily saved half for lunch the next day. BUT NO. I ate it all. (And then I complain about my dress size. Pfft!)  For drinks I started off with a porter. As the holidays are a fond memory (unless you had to wrap too many presents) I fear that my dark beers will be saying farewell. Get this! This Hula's stocks Black Butte's Porter (in a bottle). Be still my heart. {Flutter, flutter}    If that wasn't enough Hula's makes a wonderful Dark & Stormy. As it was before the end of a witching hour, I made off with HH pricing. These bartenders really know what they're doing with this drink! It had just the right balance of ginger.   Hula's is upfront about telling you the cost on the menu for built in gratuity. Larger parties have 18% built in. Split checks on groups have 20% built in. A bunch of us strolled in and were able to sit at a communal table. I'd highly recommend making a reservation if you can. (For parties of six or more.) This is a hot spot!  p.s. Thank you Yelp friends who dressed in 50's Vegas/Palm Springs attire just for the fun of it!"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been here but met up with a friend for happy hour Got the sweet potatoes fries and pork tacos, Delicious. Great place to hang out and good views of old town. My only complaint was the $6.50 happy hour glass of wine, if you can call it that."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place walking around downtown craving a refreshing drink.  Sat at the bar and was helped right away.  The bartender was helpful on questions with the drinks and made them very fast.  I mean the tiki mugs the drinks get served in makes the experience better. Having a drink in a cool mug what gets better then that. The best mug has to be the dr funk you have to try it   The food is pretty good but the drinks make this place more memorable. Didn't get a chance to try the bartenders special drink but we will when we make it back to this place.    It's a open spot with a view of outside to people watch and close to anything you need to get to."}
{"text":"I ate here visiting Scottsdale and it was fantastic! Creative food combinations that were tasting and filling. I had the best lemonade I think I've ever had too!"}
{"text":"What a yummy find! Wandering around old Scottsdale and didn't know what we wanted to eat. Hula's looked inviting so we stopped for lunch. My shrimp tacos were awesome, Steve's habanero lime chicken tacos were great and not searing hot-the flavors were well blended. Server Reuben was very good and my mai tai was bueno. We'd come back!"}
{"text":"Delightful lunch.  Greeted sincerely and promptly- love the patio!!  The food was GREAT!  Shrimp tacos (one is enough unless you are famished- one person ordered two and it was really too much) and the Polynesian Chicken Sandwich (SO GOOD- perfectly spiced/flavored and grateful the ciabatta wasn't toasted/'crunchy'... it was perfect!). Experience was super pleasant and we will definitely go back.  Loved that there wasn't valet- plenty of parking weekday at 1:15pm.  Will add this to our list of 'go-tos'.  Loved it."}
{"text":"Fun cocktails. You get you money's worth of food. Very open restaurant/bar that's fun to hang out and people watch in old town."}
{"text":"Reasonable price, great food!! I had the ceviche and a vodka soda on a relaxing Sunday after visiting the free Sunday in the park event in he civic center 2min away.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"creative drink options (wide range of sweet / girly to more strong / powerful) - we sat at the bar and had a couple drinks before meeting friends for dinner up the street. we didn't eat but they had a rather complex food menu (which sometimes I am skeptical of - how can you accell at a book full of different food options a la Cheesecake Factory?) and the food smelled great.   when we originally walked in (this was a week after their initial opening, we later learned), there were no seats at the bar. we contemplated waiting but then decided we didn't have time to wait for a seat, have drinks and meet our friends on time so we walked out. we got about 15 feet out the door when the very observant bartender came after us and said that two bar seats just opened up if we still wanted them. we were impressed by his follow up.  once we got to the bar, it took a while to get a bartender to take our order (hey what happened to our friend who chased after us?) but once we finally received the drinks, the drinks were perfect and the bartender apologized and comped a drink (without our asking) and was very friendly and talkative.  for this being their first week of being open, their customer service was top notch and in itself a reason to return."}
{"text":"We have been to the Hula's a Modern Tiki Bar on Central in Phoenix in the past, but was happy to find the Scottsdale location. The bartender/manager, Max Bourne was great! Personable and accommodating, Max made what was an ordinary happy hour into a FUN experience!  Their specialty drinks were perfectly mixed and no one does coconut cream pie like this place!!! Definitely a must go!"}
{"text":"I went here on Thanksgiving eve with family. We have a nice meal, it was excellent fish and salad. After we were hanging out for a bit and catching up and we did not have anyone trying to rush us out the door or moving us out. We lost track of time talking but everyone was nice and let us chat for a while. Our waitress Lauren was the best, very helpful with the menu and quick with everything. Her recommendations were spot on and we will be back again after this relaxing and great experience!"}
{"text":"Cool little restaurant bar in Old Town Scottsdale. I have been to the one in Central Phoenix. Both are very interesting places. The food is good and on point. I usually get the Loco Moco. Fairly classic dish with a slight spin that they put on it. If you're in the neighborhood or down in Phoenix and wanting some Hawaiian style food definitely check out these restaurants."}
{"text":"A great exotic experience! Food here is different from any other restaurants. You'll probably find flavors you've never tasted before. Like the platano appetizer, the fish bites and the crispy shrimp. What a great idea the coconut sauce! I was already impressed with my drink, it was a blood orange martini. Not too strong nor too sweet. I recommend it. My friend had the mahi tahi, made with rum, definitely stronger. When you come to the fish selection, there are several options like salmon, mahi, tuna and other fish. Once you have selected the fish then you can choose the condiments and preparation. We went for a blackened ahi tuna, split. It came with mashed potatoes and broccolini. The tuna was not over cooked which was my fear, but perfectly rare on the inside. We didn't make it for dessert but I will definitely come back more often, the ambience and the service are also great!"}
{"text":"Great Sunday Brunch!  Although I didn't really want to wait until 9:30 for breakfast, I wanted to do something different this morning. After passing by Hula's for months, I scanned the reviews and the menu and decided to stop in and give it a try.  I sat at the bar, and the bartender immediately came over, provided me with drink and food menus, and asked what he could bring me to drink. I indicated that I hadn't been in before, needed a few minutes, and wasn't in a hurry. He said just to let him know when I was ready.  A few minutes later I made my decision, and put the menu down. He immediately returned. I asked if they had decaf coffee, and he said he would be glad to brew a fresh pot for me. I asked for half caffeinated half decaf, and ordered the Portuguese Sausage Island Benedict, and explained that I needed my eggs to have completely firm whites. He said that would be no problem at all. He was attentive, friendly, smiled and made good eye contact at all times - hallmarks of great service.  A short while later he brought my coffee. It was WONDERFUL. He explained that it was Kona coffee, and that he would refill it whenever I was ready. I relaxed and opened my book (I always carry one) and settled in to enjoyed reading and sipping my coffee.  My food did take a fair amount of time to be prepared, but I arrived right when they opened and allowed that they were probably just getting going. I also knew that my egg preparation would take extra time and attention. I had a refill on my coffee as I continued to wait. I wasn't in a hurry, and was enjoying the setting.  When my plate arrived, it looked perfect, and when I cut into my eggs they were done exactly the way I had asked for them - a big deal for me since I'm finicky about eggs. The English muffins were still soft enough to absorb the delicious hollandaise sauce, which was generously applied to the dish. The Portuguese Sausage was perfectly cooked and still juicy but not fatty. My hashbrowns were crisp, the way I had ordered them. My plate was perfect, and I took my time enjoying it. The bartender checked back with me soon after I tried my dish to make sure it was to my liking, and to refill my coffee again. The portion was too generous for me to finish, but the dish was so good, I didn't want to stop eating it.  The restaurant wasn't busy yet, so I felt free relaxing, reading, and sipping coffee. When I realized that the morning happy hour had started, I decided to try a cranberry mimosa for the bargain price of $2. Who could pass that up! It was a great way to finish off my meal. Full, refreshed, and ready to go, I couldn't believe that my entire bill was only about $15.   Overall, a great experience. Great service, great food, and a relaxing environment. I will be returning. I want to try the Spam Island Benedict next."}
{"text":"Have been a number of times, but finally found my dish- the grilled fish tacos.  Perfectly prepared and super fresh every time I have them.  Fish is tender and slightly blackened on corn tortillas with cabbage and a side of black beans and coconut rice.  Really flavorful and healthy! Also last time had a bite of friends ribeye- it was awesome"}
{"text":"I 'm definitely a fan of Hula's! I didn't give the loco loco a try again, but I've been back multiple times for the short rib dish, drinks and happy hour deals! This place was much better the next few times I went, and I've also ate from their other location on central! Hula's is a nice place to go have food or drinks and I'd definitely recommend at least giving them a shot!"}
{"text":"As with the Hula's on Central, Hula's in Scottsdale is quite nice. I like that it's located slightly off Scottsdale Road so it doesn't seem as intensely busy. I like the layout of the restaurant a lot, and the service is good. As always, can't go wrong with a mai tai. I also like the tofu tacos and their Caesar salad is delish.  If you're touring restaurants in Old Town Scottsdale, give Hula's a go."}
{"text":"Hula's is one of our favorite places to visit when in Scottsdale.  Love the cocktails and bartenders are always really friendly.  We stopped in on our last night of a long weekend trip with a teenage family member and the bartender went out of his way to concot a special virgin drink for her.  Can't wait to come back next time and try the food!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour late at night! And they're dog friendly! They have all the best rum drinks I always crave at the beach! It's like a little getaway from the desert!"}
{"text":"Love , Love Hula's . The food is always good and the drinks are fun. I've had the fish tacos, burger and the coconut shrimp all have been nothing but spectacular."}
{"text":"This place was a bit underwhelming. The drinks were OKAY. But just okay. I got the loco moco and was pretty unimpressed. My boyfriend got some tacos and they were pretty bland. The service was not that great either. Our server was no help in helping us understand the menu let alone recommend us something. I wouldn't go back and I wouldn't tell anyone to expect HAWAIIAN food. It's more Hawaiian inspired more than anything."}
{"text":"First off, the food was amazing! I am hawaiian so I know the good stuff. And boy did this hit the spot. We came in for lunch but they were still serving breakfast. So I got the loco moco and some Portuguese sausage. That was the nicest, fanciest, best tasting loco moco I've ever had. Portuguese sausage was a bit spicier than what I'm used to, but still good. The service was amazing! We had the nicest waiter! We were getting ready to move here from Idaho and our server actually stayed past his shift to sit down and talk with us about the area. Go!!!"}
{"text":"Spot rules, don't sleep on it. A wee bit smaller than DT location but still brings the ruckus. Always leave with a twinkle in my eye."}
{"text":"We arrived around 9:55pm when a few places were already closed.  Still a lot of people at Hula's.  We were starving and the sweet potato fries were the best I've ever had!  I had a Rice bowl which was great.  And our server was very attentive."}
{"text":"Excellent food great fresh fish and fun environment ! Had the ceviche, pulled pork tacos,shrimp tacos and ahi tuna. Will Definetly come back"}
{"text":"This place never fails. Service is impeccable. The menu, cannot argue. I love this place. Specials are fantastic. Great atmosphere. Just all around fun."}
{"text":"Dinner here was a special treat with a friendly welcome and expert service. We had plenty of questions and they were all answered honestly and respectfully - thank you!!! We settled on a few appetizers - poke (yum) and beef skewers (double yum.) Between the four of us we had the Mongolian Beef, the fresh fish, the luau pork, and the jerk pork. We all felt the meat was cooked very nicely and seasoned well, but none of us were particularly enamored with the macaroni salad. That's a pity because I was really looking forward to Hawaiian Mac Salad. Dessert was a delicious key lime pie - best I've ever had. Kudos!!"}
{"text":"This place is a find.  In the heart of downtown Scottsdale, it's close to the art gallery district.  Not at all what you think of when you hear \"Tiki\", this has an open air setting, and beautiful dark woods.  Just a gorgeous location, with a warm feel.  The service was outstanding.  Both the salad and the chicken curry were prepared to order and were extremely delicious.  The chef here has a refined taste for sauces.    I hope the trend of open elegant delicious dining started by Hula's Modern Tiki extends elsewhere.  Great restaurant, and highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great service and good food!! Reasonably priced!! ;) had the pork  taco and I really liked the rice and of course the mimosas ;)"}
{"text":"Awesome ambiance!  They did a good job with the small space they had.  The servers here are so friendly and they have an awesome drink list... not to mention AWESOME Wednesday all afternoon happy hour!  This place is a must try!"}
{"text":"The chicken thai bowl was amazing and huge ! If you're trying to decide what to order just order this. The shrimp roll app was fantastic as well. The service was pretty good. The drink we got was cute, but really sweet. I'd definitely go back with friends"}
{"text":"Got the chicken sandwich which was very good.  As good as any trendy gastro pub would serve. There is little to suggest hawaii, except the large tiki out front and,for some some reason, the beer..kona brewing.  Unfortunately, I'm not a fan of Kona.  With the craft beer explosion going on now,I'd love to see a much bigger selection(check out beer advocate please).  That being said, the atmosphere in there was outstanding and the music is indie,which gets an A+!"}
{"text":"Interesting menu. Great service. Tried the shrimp rolls with pineapple sauce and hula burger - both really good. My husband loved the ahi tuna sandwich. My favorite was the key lime pie for dessert. Can't wait to come back and try some of their other unique food and drink items!"}
{"text":"Came by here after a Giants spring training baseball game.  Though a tiki bar there was none of the kitsch.  It is a very nice space that's front is open to the street.  I rarely drink rum but I had mai tais, which were really good.  We drank and grazed on appetizers for a couple of hours.  This is a really cool place."}
{"text":"Charlie....... you rock!   Charlie is a great server, and I have to say that again. You rock! He took care of an ENTIRE large birthday party and still was prompt and attentive to us. The thing that really stood out for me with him was that he was communicative. If more people were communicative in general, I think people would be a lot more understanding and patient.   Anywho, the first thing Charlie said was that he had a large birthday party and he was going to take their orders but he would be right back to us. Understood. When he came back, I told him that was quick and he said that he felt that he took forever..and that well it was just a matter of perception which to me meant that Charlie had his guests in mind.   Okay onward with the food...   Hula's Modern Tiki is located right in Old Town Scottsdale ...and is just what it sounds like. Hawaiian food with a modern twist.   I ordered the Jawaiian Jerk Pulled Pork Entree, which came with rice, pulled pork, plantain and \"Johnny Cakes,\"   The entree came automatically split in two plates, since we were sharing and I appreciated that the kitchen did that, probably at the direction of Charlie, without even asking. Thank you! The plates were also presentable.   The pulled pork was fantastically seasoned and oh boyyyyy a kick of spice! If you don't like spicy, this WILL NOT be for you. The spice lingers, but is absolutely delicious. The fried plantain was what I expected, and the Johnny Cakes was delicious as well ...it was like a corn cake with plantains.   We also ordered a side of Mac Salad and that was also reasonably priced ($3) and well worth it. It does come cold, which reminds of the modern mac salad you get from the grocery store rather than the warm ones you get a Hawaiian place, but it was still very tasty and rather light and refreshing.   Enjoyed my experience here!"}
{"text":"Love this place. My mid-20s daughter introduced me to it. We went on a weekend day, late morning and sat at the bar. Nice, non-confusing selection of cold draft. Bartender helped me pick the right one for me (\"Not too hoppy, but not too light\"). Wanting to eat light, I ordered the bowl of Lobster Bisque with a side of cibaca bread (worth the dollar), toasted, and a lemon wedge to squirt in the bisque and at my daughter. The bisque was as close as it comes to the best bisque I have ever had (Vegas, 1980s, but maybe after all those years, this was better. Who knows, right?). Casual, cool place with a little Hawaiian thrown in here and there. Nothing cheesey like '60s let's-all-decorate-our-basements-Hawaiian that I recall and dance to \"California Dreamin' \" (I was very, very young, by the way). This place is definitely not geared to old farts on the other hand, but is a cool joint for cool people of all ages, of which to say I am one. My husband took his mid-20s (also-gorgeous) daughter here  on a trip here from her homey state, Boston, and they raved about the food and atmosphere upon returning from a weekday lunch."}
