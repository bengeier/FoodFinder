{"text":"After trying almost all a la carte Japanese places in Toronto (except for Guu), me and my friends decided yesterday that Zakkushi is the go-to place for yakitori, while Sushiya is definitely the place for sushi/sashimi. No need to consider other options.  Sushiya provides very attentive and friendly service. It also went for very simple decor, relatively plain plating comparing to other Japanese places. This is my only excuse for forgetting to take pictures, super guilty.   For its gold sashimi plate ($29), you get thai, sweet prawn, hamachi, toro, and giant clam, two pcs of each. We are talking about all rare fish and they are served super fresh. The only other place that offers giant clam in Toronto is Ja Bistro and they charge $50 for a small sashimi platter. Even Japango, their $35 deluxe sashimi platter only serves uni, salmon, white& red tuna, and prawn, aji sometimes? Correct me from wrong, but definitely no rare fish like Sushiya.  Their toro roll (6pcs) was charged a whopping $3.8. Okay they are not long, large rolls and I know you'll say that they only use small pieces in rolls. But you know how expense fresh toro is, and you won't be able to find another place that serves toro dish at $3.8. Some ($^&*^*&#@%)places charge higher for Tofu dishes, trust me.   Aji sashimi (whole fish) for $15, W-O-W. It's not a large dish, but again, aji is rare as well, and whole fish sashimi? This is the only place here.  They serve very good appetizers as well.  Ankimo (monkfish liver) for $5.8. You know it's made on the house, not from suppliers. So again, the value speaks itself, we ordered the second one btw.  Asparagus and king mushroom with ume and mayo sauce-forgot the name. First time trying, I surrendered. The asparagus and king mushroom were so fresh and crispy even, with the perfect combination of ume and mayo sauce, amazing summer dish. I appreciate food that tells you how much the chef cares.  I've also tried the TKG with thai and salmon roe (rice on half boiled egg with sashimi on top). It was not a large rice bowl but generous on sashimi for the price, and again, you know the chef devotes.  It's a shame tough that they won't let you order from Zakkushi menu even if they are under the same company, and roof. But after trying their food you will understand that it only makes you better concentrate on simple but more devoted food."}
{"text":"Attentive service. Fresh fish (with daily special directly from japan). Gold sushi platter offers good value (with toro) also enjoyed their grilled saba. Green onion toro maki is a must eat (toro at under 4 bucks is impossible anywhere else in TO) finish off with homemade red bean ice-cream. Average spending 50-60. A+."}
{"text":"Wow, I would say this sushi restaurant is one of the best restaurants I've ever had in North America. You should definitely try this one."}
{"text":"My second visit after almost a year. Sushi still remarkably fresh and of high quality!  Service is attentive and friendly, but can be on the slow side. Not the best sushi place in Toronto but definitely decent value for money.   I was dining alone today (Friday). And pleased to see 2 other solo customers. Restaurant wasn't busy at 7:30 pm.  I doubt if you need reservations for small parties. They say their peak time is around 8-9 pm.   A little shocked that they charge $2.50 for green tea (i.e. meh green tea from grocery store tea bags).  Yet they do give you a pot and keep refilling it though. This is where I deducted 1 star. Everything else is authentically Japanese!"}
{"text":"Went out for a walk to the Carlton-Sherbourne area to try out Zakkushi's $10 pitcher deal and yakitori, but when we arrived we were drawn to the gorgeous white-and romantically lit interior of the downstairs sushi bar, Sushiya.   What an incredible find. There is no avocado, cream-cheese infused california sushi here. Just beautiful, fresh, authentic Japanese-style sushi. The best I've had in Toronto. The fish was thickly sliced, buttery, and delicate. One of my all-time personal favorites, unagi (bbq eel) was incredible and just as good as I remember from Japan.  The menu is quite large, with a mix of sashimi plates, grilled fish specials, and a la carte hand rolls. The larger items like the chirashi don and kaisen don were $9.80, which I thought was a steal considering the quality of the fish. For sake drinkers, there's a nice menu with descriptions of each bottle and origin to select from.  Service was kind, and friendly.   I can't wait to go back. A definite gem."}
{"text":"Dinner visit. Seated immediately. Waitress was very attentive to our needs. I believe the theme of the restaurant is to provide service similar to that of restaurants in Japan. Unique experience regardless. We ordered a sashimi platter, grilled cod, and sea urchin on rice. Food was delicious and I would return, which means you should give it a try. Prices slightly on the luxury side but still within reason."}
{"text":"Sorry, this is not a five star sushi restaurant.  Maybe 3.5?  I like Zakkushi for yakitori and the izakaya experience, but this sushi venture just didn't measure up.    I called to make a reservation about 20 minutes prior to arriving.  However, upon arrival, there was no record of my reservation.  Very strange.  It was pretty empty so it didn't really matter.  They had a special Facebook promotion.  If you like their page and check-in, you get a complimentary appetizer.  We received marinated tuna with an egg yolk on lettuce.  This was pretty good.    The sushi rice did not hold together very well.  That in itself deducts a star.   Most of the fish was good, but I found the sea eel quite tough, instead of delicate.    Something else I noticed was the placement of the fish on the serving plate.  Pieces were adjusted over and over so the seaweed on the uni was pretty much soggy by the time it got to the table.  The preparation and service was quite slow considering our table of three were the only ones who had ordered sushi.  Yes, we were informed it would take some time, but really, what would happen if there were other people in the restaurant?    I will admit, since this place is Japanese run, my expectation was most definitely set higher than others.  It's good sushi, but certainly not the best in the city."}
{"text":"I've been searching for a long time for some authentic Japanese sushi in Toronto, I've got to say sushiya is the closest anyone has gotten in Toronto.   The place is small, with the chef right in front of you if you're at the bar.  The fish selection is good, although several items I wanted wasn't available.  The prices are also very reasonable, 4.8 for a wagyu beef sushi, 6.5 for a o-toro sushi....very good, they were delicious!!  Come here if you want an authentic sushi dining experience, just don't ask for volcano roll, spider roll, salmon flower, etc....it's not here...."}
{"text":"Over priced garbage. Their fish was NOT fresh and even the waitress agreed! I asked for the manager or the owner and was told that neither were present. GUESS WHAT? Just as we were about to leave, the manager came out and seemed like he was faking smiles at probably some regulars. Worst experience ever. Do NOT treat your customers in this manner. Idk if this is normal in Japanese culture but my partner and I were disgusted both at the service and quality of food."}

{"text":"On a Sunday night, if you are looking for a nice omakase dinner. This might be the one and only one available in Toronto, as all the other good sushi restaurants are closed. I like the tranquility and nice sake here. Sushi is not bad. Definitely not the best I have tried, but more than acceptable."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem! This is by far my favourite sushi place in Toronto! The fish is always fresh, service is awesome, and the atmosphere is nice and cozy.   Reccos: -Chirashi don  -Sushi platter (reg or special, both great) -Ochazuke (the one with red snapper/sour plum)  Yes it's on the pricey end but I think it's worth it if you care about the quality of your sushi (which I absolutely do, coming from Vancouver hehe)"}
{"text":"We decided on Sushi last minute yesterday evening.  After a quick look at Yelp, we decided on Shushi Bar Sushiya.  My girlfriend just wanted a green dragon roll.  When we first got the the Izakaya upstairs there was a 30 minute wait.  Reservations are recommended.  Instead of waiting, we went to the Sushi Bar downstairs that had to seats available at the bar. The atmosphere is very nice, bright and clean.  We also had a great view from the bar of the sushi chef's at work.  Very professional with lots of attention to detail. The menu was quite different than your usual sushi bar and there was no green dragon roll on the menu.  We are so glad it wasn't!! We had a Tuna and an unagi roll and they were delicious.  Also had a sashimi plate and two different kinds of seaweed.  I was looking for a seaweed salad and wasn't sure if it was the marinated seaweed or seaweed with vinegar, so we ordered both.  The marinated seaweed was closest to the seaweed salads I've had in the past but wasn't saturated with sauce.  It was fresh with attention to bringing out the taste of the seaweed rather than masking it with sauce.  We really enjoyed.  The seaweed with vinegar was a wonderful surprise!  Tangy and delicious.  We loved it so much, we ordered two more! All in all a really nice place and we're looking forward to going back and trying the Izakaya as well."}
{"text":"Sushiya has some of the best sushi in Toronto, Canada or Americas. Almost perfect sushi rice, fish and garnish done the authentic Japanese way. This is not the place to go for cheap sushi, gimmicky spicy rolls or Korean copycat variety of sushi. This is also not the place to go for 'innovative' modern sushi like Miku by the water. Sushiya is an example of true Edo style sushi. There was nothing to complain about whatsoever. I would rate the uni a special 6/6 because they plucked it straight out of the shell. My friends loved their grilled fish too, but I did not order any myself. The sushi is not cheap. Sushiya is not good for large groups because of the limited space."}
{"text":"This is a small and cozy location underneath an izakaya. It is brightly lit and petite. It is not great for big groups.   But it's also the first 5-star rating I've given in Toronto. Now the reason I gave it a 5 star is not because the food was the most amazing I've had. The reason is that it was exactly what I was looking for.  This place is a Japanese sushi-ya that is as close to the real Japanese sushi-ya experience as you can get in Toronto. Sure there are some good izakayas, like Guu, but this place specializes and I like that.   They do not do fancy rolls and California style sushi. They do straight up sushi and sashimi. The menu is small and tasty. The quality of fish is better than most places. The presentation is great.   Come here if you want a different experience. Come here if you want to try the Japanese sushi experience. Plus, the staff is great!"}
{"text":"By far the best sushi (that I've had, fine) in Toronto, and better than any I can think of in New York. Just a perfect aesthetic experience all-around. Expensive but worth it."}
{"text":"Sushi / sashimi is alway fresh with amazing service. Such a hidden gem of Toronto. Reminds me of sushi in Japan."}
