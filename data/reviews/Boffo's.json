{"text":"This is a great store!  Probably the best butcher in Oakville.  Definitely the best back ribs.  They also offer a number of prepared foods from main dishes to salads.  You can create a full meal that you would be proud to serve to even the most discerning company.  They make sandwiches as well that are delicious. Some really nice cheeses are also on offer.  Noel and Heather are lovely people and make a point of looking after their customers."}
{"text":"I love Boffo's. We moved to Oakville recently and this is my favorite place in town. Everything is delicious, but my absolute favorite is the steak sandwich! So good!"}
{"text":"I came out of my way because of the 5* rating to get some filet mignon steaks. The meat counter had a few other cuts of steaks etc., but no filet. He had some frozen bacon wrapped steaks all of different thicknesses. The man behind the counter was kind enough to put together three of similar thickness, so I took those. Most real butcher shops have enough beef filets to cut the steaks a customer wants.   The meat looks like good quality, but don't come here expecting a butcher shop or a butcher."}
{"text":"Our favourite one stop shop in Oakville for fresh meat and salad for easy dinner or lunch. We also used Boffo's for catering our wedding and everyone was very impressed. High quality and fresh ingredients every time! Definitely a must try in Oakville. Bring a cooler- you'll be happy you did."}
{"text":"Came in today on recommendation from a friend/foodie and got myself 2 steak sandwiches and an order of butter chicken that had just been made, all of it was excellent.  I really liked the thinly sliced steak piled high the way it was.   The sandwich was topped with very tasty roasted red peppers & onions  The Butter chicken was full of flavour and was not too spicy.   Staff here is very friendly.  All around a great experience today at Boffo's, I've found another gem to add to my rounds!"}
{"text":"Oh man, Boffo's. How do I even start to explain Boffo's?  Boffo's is flawless.  One time, Boffo's met John Stamos on a plane and he told them they were pretty...amazing.  One time, Boffo's steak was so fresh, it punched me in the face.  It was AWESOME.  But enough Mean Girls references, let's get down to the meat. THE MEAT. They are the BEST butchers in Oakville, with the best employees. Everytime I come in, I feel SO welcomed, I have never felt the least bit intimidated or like I didn't belong. I've bought everything from meats to prepared pasta meals to lunch from Boffo's, and everything is amazing, everytime. I can't get over how decadent and high-end they feel, but how friendly and down to Earth they really are.  If you like to eat, you will love Boffo's. Go today. And avoid Mean Girls references, they really drag you in...I WANT MY PINK SHIRT BACK!!"}
