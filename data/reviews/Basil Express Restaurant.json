{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place

We order from here about once a week, here are my recommendations:
 
-The appetizer platter is a nice variety of mainly deep fried dishes. 
-Pad thai is huge and comes with lots of meat/shrimp. 
-The Currys are awesome and flavourful (I recommend peanut chicken curry and  beef curry) 
-Thai Beef steak is always an awesome choice  
-Crispy beef is a nice sweet and crunchy dish
-Chicken and coconut soup makes for a nice appitizer
-The rice has a wonderful coconut/jasmine aroma.

Service is always friendly and attentive as well"}
{"text":"First off let me start off by saying this... If you LOVE Thai food, and you aren't going here... I honestly feel sorry for you. My boyfriend and I come here very regularly. The food meets beyond expectations every time. The portions are very generous, accompanied with amazing flavour! The staff is so sweet!! Do yourself a favour and treat yourself to this wonderful Thai restaurant on the danforth!"}
{"text":"Nice staff, but I was super disappointed by the food. The pad thai is very sweet and tastes like ketchup. And no dipping sauce is provided with the spring rolls, which is odd. 

There is much better Thai food out there."}
{"text":"This restaurant used to be Green Basil and it was great. Several months ago it seems to have changed ownership or management. The service and food used to be excellent. Now the service is so incredibly bad. The waitress ignores you when you sit down. You have to walk to the back of the restaurant to ask her if she can bring you a menu. The food isn't the same. I ordered Pad Thai and it was lacking flavour and was very dry. It tasted like it had been reheated several times. When I commented to the waitress she said they have a new chef. I went back once more because this used to be my favourite Thai place on the Danforth and ordered the Green Chicken Curry. Some of the chicken was lukewarm and some pieces very hot. Like it would be be if reheated unevenly in a microwave. 

They used to always bring a bowl of shrimp child as soon as you sat down. Now it seems the shrimp chips are no longer offered. That's not a big deal, but it was a nice touch welcoming patrons. Another weird detail was that they would always bring water to the table along with the menus. Last time the waitress brought me lukewarm water in a beer glass with a straw at the end of my meal. What's with that?

It's very sad because this place has gone from a 4 plus to a nothing. If you like your Thai food don't waste your time and money. I bet this place won't last as they're going to lose customers."}
{"text":"You had one job! It's painfully simple:
Don't call it PINEAPPLE Fried Rice if it has ZERO pineapple chunks in it. And you decide to bulk it up with a bag of frozen peas, carrot and corns? Not to mention the massive chunks of onion wedges. Tell me this - did the chef grab the onion when he meant to grab the pineapple?
What a waste of $13 bucks!"}
{"text":"If you love ketchup, you'll love the Pad Thai.
Have had Thai all over Toronto and this is the worst."}
{"text":"Whoa, I didn't think it was possible to get bland thai food, but this was beyond bad. Ordered the House Platter, which was 2 very dry chicken strips, not bad shrimp on a stick, a couple of bland spring rolls and probably the worst cold rolls I've EVER tasted. (how can you mess up something that you barely cook?!) 
The Thai spicy Noodle was way overcooked to the point that the noodles were mushy. The Green Chicken Curry had a nice flavor but the veggies were overcooked. (aren't they suppose to be stir fried?). Almost as if they had been sitting in the sauce for too long.
Was hoping to love this place, but after a few bites we chucked the whole thing."}
{"text":"I grabbed some dinner to go. Coconut chicken mushroom soup and Chicken Pad Thai for me. Cashew Chicken and coconut rice for my colleague. Both meals were great! I waited maybe 10-15 minutes for our order to be ready. The restaurant is clean. The staff are friendly. The prices are comparable to other Thai restaurants."}
{"text":"My first time eating here and I found a piece of hair in my soup. This is so dirty. Makes me feel really sick. I already eaten a lot of the soup like more than half. So dirty I was eating food with someone's hair in it"}
{"text":"for some reason my kids like the pad thai.

i had the chicken satay once and the peanut sauce made me gag.

but i'm writing because any place that could make a simple pick up for an order worthy of one star is going to get a write up.

i went in to pick up two dishes around 7:00pm. the place only had two tables going but the gal working the counter made like she was serving the subway platform at yonge and bloor at rush hour with her running about. 

when she finally asks my business she runs to check on the order. a few more minutes. and yes it comes in a few more minutes. fine.

when we finally get to the payment part, after asking me how i was paying [cash] she hands me a bill and seeing as there is a big honking sign about the 10% off for cash in front of my nose i had to ask why the discount was not reflected in bill. put out she explained that one item was special and not on discount but okay to the 10% off the pad thai. whatever. but don't make me feel like i stole the baby's candy.

so i have now paid, she goes for the food, dumps the bag and high tails it back to the kitchen.   she returns and i ask for a plastic bag, she dashes to get it and then throws it at me. and not a nice throw. sheesh."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery this weekend in efforts of trying something new, ended up with a very bland experience of flavourless thai food.

The spring rolls were pretty good but came with no accompanying dipping sauce that one expects with spring rolls. Pad thai was really sweet. At first when mixing with lots of hot sauce it was still pretty good, but by the end of it I was really un-enthused.
We also ordered the Stir Fried Glass Noodle and this was some of the most flavourless mix of noodles and vegetables with a bit of chicken and shrimp in the mix.

It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good."}
{"text":"Got a flyer in the mail and thought I'd give it a try. Not sure what that noodle dish was, but it definitely wasn't pad Thai. The sauce base was tomato sauce, or maybe ketchup. With a bit of spice and some peanuts. Basically inedible and nothing Thai about it. I also got spring rolls and cold rolls to meet the delivery minimum. The sauce was the same for both, and not good. The spring rolls were more like samosas in their contents, and the cold rolls had hard boiled eggs and some very weird ingredients. Do not order from here, the food is not edible. Biggest waste of $25, and such a disappointment."}
{"text":"Don't deserve more than 2 stars. 
The food is just okay. The curry chicken is creamy and very spicy. The fresh roll doesn't taste so \"fresh\". Good other places for Thai food..."}
{"text":"I agree with some other posters here that this place is NOT the same as the original one that first opened here. I got some Pad Thai recently and it was WRETCHED. Vicki B is right on the money about the \"sauce.\" Seriously....it really could be ketchup as it tastes that sweet. And it \"used\" to be loaded with shrimp. Now?!! Lucky if I could find 3 little ones!

All in all, a huge disappointment and I regret to cross it off my steadily growing list of places on Danforth to avoid."}
{"text":"This is my go to home base Thai and I am never disappointed by the generosity of the portions, the taste and display of the plates or the friendly happy service."}
{"text":"I came here tonight with three friends, two of whom had a show to get to one hour from when we sat down. The waiter assured us the food would arrive in 30 minutes or less, as we had inquired when we got there if this was a possibility.

20 minutes later, no food except my appetizer green mango salad arrived. It was delicious.... Until I felt something sharp and poke my mouth. I pulled it out and yes, it was a staple. We all immediately stopped chewing  and just stared at this staple I pulled out of my mouth. We wanted to flag the waitress to tell her to cancel our order,but couldn't find anyone to speak to for at least 10 more minutes. Needless to say, we left hungry and my friends pretty much late to their show.

Moral of the story, super disappointing experience. Do not eat here unless you would be ok with finding office supplies in your food. And make sure you have a tetanus shot."}
{"text":"I wish I could give 0.

Let me start by saying this was my second time going. First time was nice. Brought friends back and had one of the worst nights.

Went with husband and another couple. We arrived at 6:00pm. One other table full. By 6:20 we ordered dinner. Appetizers and meals. By 7:00 one friend got fresh rolls. 7:15 I got spring rolls. At this point we expressed that we were in a rush (a friend had to leave by 8.... We never thought this would be an issue) and could we have meals soon and Bill. At 720 other 2 spring rolls came. Mine are cold waiting. We again ask for bill and that we need to leave...

7:30 2 meals arrive. Then other one a few minutes later then mine. I look at my tofu dish and get suspicious. It is meat. My husband tries. Yup meat. We tell the.. They don't apologize just leave.. Another few minutes no update. At 745 I cancelled my food, everyone is eating and we need to leave soom. People are close to done. They still no bill.

no waitstaff in dining room most of the night.... were they cooking too? I am a strict vegetarian, they didnt seem to care they brought me meat......

8:00 friends leave. We pay about 10 min later. No discount. No warning it will be slow. I am now waiting for pizza to arrive starving.

no apology..... just rude service...."}
