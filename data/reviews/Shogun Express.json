{"text":"This is about as good as it gets for Asian food in this price range.  The chicken isn't chewy like many other inexpensive Asian restaurants.  I've had several of their dishes and without a doubt the Yakisoba with chicken is my favorite.  I love the white-meat chicken and broccoli (with Teriyaki sauce).  The broccoli is quality, and never overcooked.  And I love their Teriyaki sauce."}

{"text":"are u kidding me people 4 stars had the spicy chicken bowl 98 percent rice chicken not spicy and the tuna roll well........ the tuna piece was so small all you could taste was rice i relize this place is cheap but thats because so is rice"}
{"text":"I am such a freak for this place.... Whenever I'm in the mood for fast and cheap, but don't want to sacrifice healthy choices, I always end up at Shogun. I can never decide between the Spicy chicken teryaki bowl or the Chicken caesar salad, both of which are quite delicious and under six dollars. It doesn't get better than that. MMMMM good."}
{"text":"This place subscribes to the philosophy that success can be achieved by doing one thing exceptionally well. And they do. They make a mean white teriyaki chicken bowl. Vicious. That's how good that is.   The problem is, much deviation from the chicken bowl is not a good idea. They have some basic sushi rolls that I would not suggest, and probably a few other things too that I have been too teriyakied up to notice.   Stick with that, and you're golden."}
{"text":"I had the Chicken Salad which was a lovely blend of shredded cabbage, white meat chicken, peanuts, scallions, chow mein noodles, and a completely unobtrusive dressing with a sesame cracker.  It was such a great blend of textures and flavors that I thought about it all day after I ate it and can't wait to try more of their salads.  I used to get the bowls, but every one that I tried had too much overly sweet teriyaki.  I almost gave up on this restaurant, but I'm glad I didn't.  Plus one star!"}
{"text":"Shogun Express is okay...IF you're looking for a quick, decent lunch, but that's about it. Plus I don't find them to be very veggie friendly.  They offer only a couple of things for vegetarians, and the rest you have to try and customize without meat.   Last time I was at this location, there was a family there with their two kids.  The littlest one kept screaming \"ME LOVE CHICKEN,\" over and over again. And each time he did this, bits of the beloved chicken sprayed everywhere. And I mean everywhere.  All over his dirty little face and neck, on the table, on the floor, perhaps on passerby's.  I could barely eat my food. It was maybe the grossest thing ever.  And the parents found it hysterically funny, which only made the kid do it even more.   So I guess this could be why I have a feeling of animosity toward Shogun Express. I know plenty of people that like it, but my advice is to spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place. I really did. A rice bowl is something fairly easy to do right, and I can't say that Shogun Express did so. It's unfortunate, because they're one of my favorite quick and easy dinners and I would have eaten here often if it had been even slightly palatable.  I got a fried tofu and veggie rice bowl and just about everything except the teriyaki sauce was below par. The rice wasn't the yummy sticky rice- it was just bland and squishy. The breading around the tofu tasted like raw flour and the only \"veggie\" I got was broccoli (which was at least not over cooked)  I only managed to force down half of it.   My friend who ordered a hibachi steak teryiaki bowl suffered from crippling stomach pains later in the night. Plus, he said the meat was chewy and low quality.   I don't think I'm going back any time soon. The only thing that makes that a possibility is Jennifer's review that said their salads were amazing... If they make them without chicken I might be willing to give that a try."}
