{"text":"Our first time in here and will definitely come back. Food was excellent. Service was good. Watched staff working as a team. Everyone was pleasant and willing to assist the customers or each other."}
{"text":"Great new breakfast spot. Very clean and very nice employees. Nice big portions with big selections. Chorizo plates are the bomb!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Really nice decor. Friendly staff. Only thing was my friend's eggs (sunny-side up) were  extremely undercooked. We will definitely go back, just watch out for the eggs."}
{"text":"Ordered the biggest waffle, forgot what it was called. Pretty good. Came with strawberries, bananas and walnuts with whipped cream!   The other order, not sure what it was, haha I know, not very helpful. BUT the potatoes was delicious!! It was really good.   Great service!! Ac is on full blast too, so that was great! It's too dang hot outside!  I will be returning!"}
{"text":"Went there yesterday for the first time. Many items to choose from. I picked the \"Mexican Skillet\" breakfast. The portion was large and I took half of it home. Will go back again sometime for lunch to try their \"Monte Cristo\" sandwich. The service was very good and the dining area and bathrooms were clean."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great coffee and fantastic service!!  Can't wait to bring my husband here for the El Patr√¥n & the coffee!!!  This will be our new breakfast spot for sure!!  Well worth the round-trip drive from Maricopa!!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing and I really liked the personal touch that was provided by the manager Casey.  It is hard to find a really good breakfast place and this one is a must try!!!!"}
{"text":"If you are in a group of at least 5, they add an automatic gratuity of 18%.  Food is good but expensive, $73 for 3 meals, 2 kids' meals and 2 large and 1 small orange juice with the automatic tip.  Large orange juice cost $5.  Kids' orange juice cost $3.  Our server Samantha was unprofessional and rude.  She needs more training."}
{"text":"We live down the street and noticed Sunnys had good reviews. We went to grab some lunch on a tuesday afternoon. Right from the start I could tell there was confusion amoung the staff. The hostess sat us after waiting 10 mins, it was a slow day and not many people there. We never had the same server, many people where interrupting us asking if wr needed anything when 2 mins before some else asked if we needed anything. To much staff confusion for the simplest  of tasks. Spend 50 bucks hopping for a good experience, wont return ."}
{"text":"Checked this place out for the first time.  Great customer service, the food was cooked just right, and the portions are very sizeable.  Will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"We were seated and a girl asked us what we wanted to drink and she never came back.  We never recieved our drinks and a waiter never came to serve us and take our orders.  We waited for 15 min and no one asked if we have been helped yet.  We Left due to poor service!  Dont go here!  Bad service!"}
{"text":"I'm always looking for locally owned places like this to take my Grandmother to. We had lunch here this week and we both loved it. The service is great and the food is good. I'm definitely glad we stumbled across it. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Did not enjoy this place one bit! I have a two year old who is hard to entertain! No one came and took a drink order til about ten minutes after we were seated. We didn't get are food til almost 50mins after we ordered it and they brought out my sons food last which was ten minutes after getting mine:( on top of all that the pancakes were super dry. Who knows maybe we caught them on a bad day? This was just my experience. The food was ok but not worth waiting all that time and it wasn't even busy when we had gone in."}
{"text":"First time here. Great food, huge portions. Loved the New Mexico omelet. Best green Chile sauce. Service was outstanding by Jonelle."}
{"text":"My fourth time eaten here and each time I experienced great food at reasonable prices and awesome customer service. Best chorizo burrito I have eaten in a very long time and side of fruit was so sweet and fresh. Erica, Jennelle, Jennifer and Nathan have all been fantastic server's. The manager was extremely friendly and wanted to ensure we we're having a great dinning experience. Great place to take a large group to enjoy a fabulous meal."}
{"text":"In Chandler for business and found Sunny's. This is a big boy breakfast so bring your appetite. The food was very good and came the way it was ordered. The service was great! I'll make sure to find my way back to Sunny's on my return trips to Chandler."}
{"text":"Sunny'S breakfast is a good casual spot for a family breakfast. We went there, for a breakfast and I ordered their California skillets, it was good. They have good coffee too. Cute decors, and services was good too."}
{"text":"Great service. Great fresh, high quality food. The staff are very attentive (even when they are not your assigned server).  The eggs benedict plate was delicious. Plenty of options for those needing to eat gluten free.   Warm and inviting, open decor.  Great for kids."}
{"text":"Best place for breakfast in Chandler . The coffee and fresh squeezed orange juice is amazing!"}
{"text":"Being from Chicago and used to \"great breakfast\" places, we were fortunate to run into Sunny's Breakfast & Lunch.  I've lived here for over 3 years now and have tried MANY breakfast places, and finally found one with Sunny's, that has great quality food and great service.   What I loved: Fresh tasting Coffee; Freshly squeezed orange juice; Meat Lovers Breakfast. (The ham and bacon is soooo good); Service is great;  Gluten Free options. (Awesome fruit cup which includes fresh bananas, strawberries, and grapes, instead of toast). My kids love the pancakes and fresh juice.  Even has great Lunch menu for my weekday lunch break. Am able to get in and out quickly for lunch.  This place was just built, so very updated decor, and has a nice outdoor patio.  Highly recommend Sunny's Breakfast & Lunch if you are in or near Chandler."}
{"text":"Just had one of the BEST chicken pita wraps ever ! I was pleasantly surprised considering this is primarily a breakfast brunch restaurant. It was great quality, inexpensive & the portion was HUGE ! The service, staff & management was excellent & very attentive. The restaurant was super clean & I loved the modern decor. I would definitely recommend this restaurant & will be dining there again soon ! :) this place gets 5 stars for sure !"}
{"text":"I thought the one in Tempe was fabulous...This place is off the hook fantastic!! Fresh squeezed Orange juice?? To die for!! I will be back on a regular basis!!"}
{"text":"When we arrived at 11:00 a.m., the restaurant was not at all busy and we were seated promptly.  I asked that my coffee be poured into the thermal cup that I brought, but the server instead brought the coffee in one of their cups which led to a mess when I transferred it to my own cup.  I really like my coffee to stay hot in my own mug, so my visit to Sunny's was not off to a great start.  It got worse when I took my first bite of the Mediterranean omelet.  I wasn't sure I was going to be able to swallow because it was so glomped full of cheese.  When I told the server I did not like my entree due to excessive cheese, she told me the cheese was only on the top.  I had to show her the slimy inside before she asked the kitchen to remake the omelette with less Swiss cheese.  My husband enjoyed his Western Scramble and was pretty much finished before my new omelette arrived.  My wheat toast was boring and my husband's English muffin was puny.  The home fries had a distinct lard flavor which I did not enjoy, but the portion was huge.  I imagine we'll give this restaurant one more try because the menu is varied, but I won't be in a hurry to do so."}
{"text":"The best breakfast place. I love everything I've ordered here. I'm super picky, so me liking everything is a huge thing. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"My husband had been going to Sunny's Diner for years in Tempe since he moved to AZ. He has always said this is his favorite breakfast place, so when we saw a location open up in Chandler, we had to check it out (extra points already since this is a bit closer to us). After going there a couple of times, my observation is that this location definitely seems bigger, nothing fancy but nicely decorated and clean. We usually go on Saturday mornings & have no issues being seated immediately. Their service is good, the waitresses are friendly, quick, & attentive.  They offer multiple options of omelets, benedicts, skillets, pancakes, and so on. My husband likes the Greek omelet and gets it quite often. I like the Garden omelet or make-my-own especially since I can omit the cheese. Their omelet plates are large since they come with home fries or tomato slices, and toast, english muffin, tortilla, or biscuit. They have some substitutions as well for an additional charge. If you're not a big eater, I would look to split breakfast with someone else. Overall, simple food but it's done well. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food, great environment. Think Denny's minus the dirty Walmart people with their snotty petri dish kids. An extra bonus from me to Sunny's for actually having fresh squeezed orange juice. That stuff is liquid crack."}
{"text":"Went for lunch, food was very good as well as the service. I had a tuna melt with sweet potato fries, my daughter had the Arizona melt and salad both were excellent. Next time we will try breakfast they have a huge menu with a lot of options."}
{"text":"Stopped in this little place before work and I'm very impressed!! The California Benedict is absolutely phenomenal. I can never seem to find a place that does it just right and this is it!! Definitely coming back here. Also such a  cute environment. Love it!!"}
{"text":"I decided to try out a new breakfast joint and ran into this gem.. they made my food fast! It was clean and very very good! I'm so happy to have found this quaint place! I was even greeted by the manager Casey! I felt important.. thank you Sunny's!"}
{"text":"On our way to the mall we decided to stop by for brunch. As you walk in, there is an airy spaciousness feeling. It's very modern with a contemporary feel but still has the traditional diner look with barstools set at the counter. There is an outdoor patio for additional seating. We ordered the El Patron skillet  with a California Club. Both were delicious. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and great food! I ordered the California Skillet. With the construction come from the north on Erie."}
{"text":"I've been to Sunny's in Tempe quite a few times a while back when I worked right down the street and when my friend told me they opened right by our place in Chandler I was stoked. Their new location is pretty fabulous with friendly staff and delicious food - the home fries and THEE best ever! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Thank the Gods, finally a Sunny's on this of side town..same great food..Woo Hoo!  As you would expect, this build out is far superior than the older one in Tempe. Modern and clean and with stools that are not floor mounted at breakfast counter. Spacious comes to mind, not cramped like Dennys and super high quality seating. Though I can't try everything today, I can see they have the latest equipment, fresh ground coffee..3 different ones, some giant Zumex machine for fresh juice.  I am sure this has been a struggle with unbelievably inept construction outside, shameful. Servers are great, many said hello and made sure we were good. Some reviews are silly, this place will get into its groove over time.Enjoy!"}
{"text":"After hearing many great things about this place I had to try it for myself and needless to say I was blown away. From the service, all the way down to the food 5stars  The GM Casey even took the extra time out to make sure the experience for I and those I was with was bar none, thank you! Will be visiting again real soon!!"}
{"text":"Was down in the EV for work and had chance to have a late brekkie at this new place.  Everything was really good.  The service, food and beverages were all great.    Coffee was definitely not traditional breakfast restaurant coffee--it was great coffee.  Shared the New Mexican omlette.  It had cheese, green chile(not enough) and a really nice shredded beef sauce.   The potatos it came with were outstanding.  Service by the whole team was superb.  It was a little later in the morning, but everyone was super friendly and helpful.  Highly recommend if you want a good brekkie.  I would like to return and try some more menu items."}
{"text":"I had a terrific breakfast here on 27 NOV 2017 AD. The establishment was clean, bright and the staff was helpful and friendly. The menu had terrific variety and the food tasted great.  I would recommend this restaurant to family and friends!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast find! Portions are decent and the place seems fairly new or recently opened. Spacious interior and bathrooms are clean."}
{"text":"This place was great! I got the house spaghetti and meatballs. I might have 2 helping leftover its so huge! The garlic bread is great, buttery and crispy on both sides. The banana nut French toast have it your way came with 2 slices bacon and home fries(which I ordered crispy) for $9.99 and my girlfriend loved it. She had 2 pieces of French toast leftover. Nice people, clean place, and huge delicious portions. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended and definitely didn't disappoint. Everyone is so friendly and the place is very clean and simple. It's nice to go into a positive environment. The food is great and service is quick even when they're busy. Construction is surrounding it so understandable why people may not go there but it's really not difficult at all to get to even with the construction."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place :( the food just wasn't as great as it looked. Ordered the chicken fried steak, eggs, home fries and a biscuit, bottom of the steak was hard and difficult to cut through. Home fries have potato skin in them and they just weren't as crispy as I'd like (prefer hash browns). Biscuit would have been good with gravy I think. Also ordered the banana nut pancakes, flavor was decent but parts of the edges were again, hard, for lack of a better word. Coffee also tasted scorched, I actually disliked it and couldn't even mask the taste with creamer. The meal came out to about $28, unlikely to return."}
{"text":"If you haven't checked out this place, man are you seriously missing out. This is the spot. As a serious breakfast connoisseur I have never had the honor of giving 5 stars but if anywhere deserves it it's this Sunnys. The food is BOMB, service is ON POINT and the prices are totally reasonable! Don't waste your time at your usual waffle house, set your taste budz straight at Sunnys dude!"}
{"text":"This place was not worth the money or the time. Get there and they were not busy at all. Gave our name for the seating, the girl didn't even listen to the name given. Then we were sat about 7 minutes later. There were about 12 open tables and 2 people in front of us. One party of 3 and one party of 2. Was surprised at how long it took to seat us.  We were sat at our table and the young lady brought us our drinks right away. But while sitting for 15 minutes no one came over to ask if we were ready to order or if we had any questions. I had to flag someone down just to get the waitress over.   During this time I noticed some of the employees towards the back area by the long counter talking and not paying attention to the customers.   Order the whole hog omlete just wanted to sub the ham for onions, well no substitutions so had to pay more for that. We also ordered the country breakfast. When we got the food, the gravy for the biscuts was really bitter, the omlete was very blah.   In my opinion horrible service and the food wasn't that good. When asked how our food was when paying we said something and they never really acknowledged it. We weren't looking for free food, more of a we apologize, we will speak with the manager, and please try us again. Nope just the look of confusion on the guys face when paying and didn't know what to say.   I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Very good - and close! The food was great, and everyone was super nice. However, we were surprised at the cost. It was almost $40 for the 2 of us to have breakfast - that's crazy."}
{"text":"We've tried this new breakfast joint a couple of times and so far so good.  On the first visit I had the Greek omelet with home fries and a B & G on the side. ($13.78)  And my husband had the meat lovers breakfast with home fries and an English muffin.  ($10.99).  A regular coffee is $2.79.  Overall everything was pretty tasty and the portions were huge.  The only thing I didn't really like was it tasted like the green peppers in the omelet had either been frozen, or had been sitting for awhile.  They had kind of a greyish color to them and the flavor was a little off.  I picked out most of them and the rest was fine.  I love feta cheese and they put a bunch on that omelet.  We had enough leftovers for another meal at home.    The second time I had the country breakfast with bacon ($9.99) and my husband had the chicken fried steak with home fries and an English muffin ($10.99).  My iced coffee with hazelnut was $3.29.  Again, everything was good and tasted like it came out of Grandma's kitchen, in huge portions.  We had a box full of leftovers to take home.  The interior is bright and welcoming, the staff is friendly and efficient, and there's plenty of parking.  Overall, we're both fans and will be repeat customers but we were discussing that in the future we'll probably just share something because both breakfasts plus my coffee are hitting $30.  We could easily split any one of the breakfasts and it would be plenty of food."}
{"text":"Love this place! Tried something new each visit and have no complaints. Definitely becoming a favorite place to go after church on Sunday. Worth the hassle driving around the construction, but looking forward to that roadwork being done!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and friendly service. Love their coffee!! Highly recommend it!!!"}
{"text":"Great service, great food. The volcano biscuit was incredible and the food came out quick. Awesome spot in chandler - I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I seriously love this place. I enjoy the fact that I can come in for a quick post workout breakfast and they have healthy options for me!  You can substitute cottage cheese for the home fries for free and fruit just for a 1.50 more.  I tend to switch my choices up and am never disappointed.  This is the California omelet with cheddar cheese.. so good.  If you have never been here before make sure you come hungry because their portions definitely do not disappoint.  And the staff is awesome! Must try in chandler."}
{"text":"Was excited to try Sunny's for breakfast as this is close to my house.  Overall experience was not good. Was seated right away at a small table (there was only two of us) right next to another group of people. Several other tables and booths were open.   Never got a coffee refill throughout the entire dining experience. Potatoes were very bland. No one came to clear our dishes. Waited over 10 minutes for the waitress to come get our check (no name tags are worn and never introduced herself by name.) Hostess was extremely friendly and the biscuit was great.  I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service!!  I had the chicken fajita skillet, very good! I would recommend it."}
{"text":"Brand new.. service was real nice and food was great-- had eggs Benedict egg was cooked perfect!! Will be going back soon....."}
{"text":"Our Sunday ritual! Wonderful service, tasty and fresh food. The pancho omelet is a favorite."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place all morning till 3:00 PM.  Terrific service. Great huevos rancheros and eggs Benedict. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"First time here at Sonny's and I would def give them a solid 4 stars for their service, prices, portions and quality of food. The atmosphere was also very open and it didn't seem so overcrowding.   My husband and I both had the piglet skillet and the portion was very large! The quality and taste was good, but I was disappointed in their biscuit. It was a large biscuit, came out very warm but after the biscuit cooled quickly it turned into a large hockey puck. Everything else was tasty especially the orange juice, freshly squeezed!!   Our server was very kind and attentive, drinks were always refilled either with coffee or water without us even having to ask.   We will def return to try out other dishes that they offer."}
{"text":"This was our 1st time going, the decor is simply perfect, waitress's were the best, and did I mention how perfect our food was?????????!!!!!!!!!! Yup, we will be going back!"}
{"text":"Best diner in town - no comparisons!! Great food, low prices, and huge portions. We had the greek salad with herb vinaigrette and the breakfast burrito and couldn't finish everything. The vinaigrette and salad were fresh and delicious. The breakfast burrito was enormous filled with all the fixings. Thank you for coming to Chandler! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Where to begin... took 25 mins to seat 2 of us. As we are being sat counted 9 open tables. Struck me as odd since there were several people waiting to be sat. Waitress seemed to be annoyed. After taking our order we waited 41 mins before we got our food. At point the annoyed waitress came over and said \"I know your hungry so am I, we can't order anything right now either\". Not sure why she would say that to us. Upon receiving our food it was ok but nothing to get excited about. I ordered the New Mexico omlet, it had several green chili skins make it hard to eat and I ended up scraping it out. The home fries were over cooked to the point of burnt. My husband had the Chicano Benedict and was just as diappoint... prepackaged chorizo with mediocre flavor and the same over cooked home fries. We will not be coming back nor will we recommend it to anyone.  I think management needs to take a new look and the kitchen needs to get organized."}
{"text":"Great friendly staff. Mediocre food. I was really bummed because this place is raved about on Living Chandler (FB). Potatoes were weird. Bacon was 90% fat. My boyfriend got the Irish Benedict. He didn't like it so they traded it for the original free of charge!"}
{"text":"Very nice staff. The food is good, HUGE sharable portions. 1 plate can easily fill two hungry tummies. Beautiful food presentation, after all we eat with our eyes first. Prices for the amount you get is good. I'd bring my family back for sure"}
{"text":"Great food! We had California Burgers. They were great! Extra Crispy onion rings just the way I like them. Friendly staff!!! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Huge portions of perfectly prepared omelette and chocolate chip pancakes Yum! The coffee they have is delicious. Super friendly server with a smile. Enjoyed a cute atmosphere. Support a local hometown business!"}
{"text":"Always great service and the food is unbelievable! We love coming here for breakfast or brunch!"}
{"text":"West to Sunny's for the first time this weekend and was not disappointed. I got the basic two eggs with sausage and potatoes. Eggs were cooked perfectly and the home fries were delicious! Can't to come back!"}
{"text":"Planned to do breakfast before going to work today.  Looking for someplace convenient to our commute I spotted Sunny's.  Reviews seem mixed, but it sounded promising.  So we decided to do it.  The place looks like an elegant Denny's.  I mean that in a good way.  There is still the counter, booths, tables, just like you'd see in Denny's, but it's all done just a bit nicer. The first thing we received was water.  It was tap water, unfiltered.  In Chandler the water is very hard.  I think they should run it through a Brita or something just to take the edge off the hardness.  The menu seems quite varied.  It makes a good effort to liven-up the most boring meal of the day.  More than just eggs, bacon, sausage, toast. (blech!)  They have skillets (not served on a skillet, apparently), different ways to do eggs benedict, numerous omelette choices, etc.  I settled on a classic, the chicken-fried steak.  It was basic but good.  Perhaps a bit smaller than other places might serve.  The gravy seasoning seemed to be mostly pepper but it worked.  I liked it.  I upgraded the toast (boring!!) to pancakes, but found the steak and the eggs and \"country fries\" (seemed more like hash browns to me) to be enough.  So I packed them without trying them (probably eat them tomorrow at home).  My wife settled on the western skillet.  She really liked it  She also loved her blueberry pancakes.  She also commented that the coffee was very fresh and good for a basic service coffee (i.e. the coffee they keep in their carafe for refills on demand).  Evidently they use their own blend from Central America.  Perhaps not a gourmet coffee, but then we weren't expecting a gourmet coffee.  Better than Dunkin or Denny's or any fast-service coffee.  Service was appropriately attentive, and very friendly.  Seemed like a nice kid.  It's nice to know this place is available on our way to work."}
{"text":"This place is just not good. Not worth the money. I ordered the biscuits and gravy, which is one of my favorite meals and hard to mess up. I couldn't even finish my meal. The hash browns had literally a whole piece of potato end it wasn't cooked and it looked dirty no was so grossed out. The eggs didn't even have salt or any flavor. The biscuit was hard and not even the gravy softened it up. The gravy was all right. Just bad all around. Don't waste your money. So many other good breakfast spots in Chandler."}
{"text":"Nice breakfast place, great decor and space.  Hade the eggs Benedict with home fries. Good stuff, just right. Perfect home fries.  Son had chocolate chip pancakes with side bacon and sausage. Big pancakes! Bacon and sausage we cooked well. Also served was biscuits and gravy, rather bland and dry would not recommend.  Overall good experience. Service was awesome and staff great and friendly!"}
{"text":"I go to this place every once in a while when I feel like slipping off my diet.  Mmmmm, good stuff here. I had the chicken fried steak and eggs. Wholly shit, I enjoyed the god damn hell out of this!      Service is getting better. In the beginning. You couldn't take a breath without someone interupting a thought or conversation by their standard \"is everything ok?\"  This time it was only twice and at not so invasive timing.     The drink refiller lady - I don't get why they have to take my glass off the table and go where ever they go to refill it, but that's annoying as hell.  Keep my god damn glass at the table.  But that's not a big enough deal to rate this place low. Pricing however does, I mean kinda pricey, but if you eat out as seldom as I do, it's ok and worth a few extra bucks. Still pricey though.  If this place was a few bucks cheaper I would rate a 5 star breakfast. Also the servers have zero sense of humor. So don't look forward to getting a reaction to a good joke.  Food however, is awesome. Quick. Hot. And they can follow some simple customization requests.  4 stars."}
{"text":"First time patron...and will definitely be returning! DO NOT LET THE CONSTRUCTION DETER YOU! My husband and I moved to Chandler and was looking for a new place for breakfast that was close to our home. I ordered the chicken fried steak and eggs; my husband ordered the country breakfast. Both were fantastic. Very clean establishment, staff was very friendly and attentive. Give them a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Really great spot for breakfast. Nice atmosphere and smells great. Everything I had was amazing new go to spot for breakfast"}
{"text":"This is our favorite breakfast spot. We lived in Tempe and frequented that location for years. We were thrilled to have one open close to our new home in Chandler.  The food is great. My ususal is the Time Honored Breakfast with scrambled eggs (spiniach & swiss cheese added) with homefries & bacon. Today I got poached eggs instead - still delicious. The French Toast is to die for. Fresh squeezed oj is addictive. I don't even want to drink the store bought kind at home any more.  Variety of Sandwiches for lunch. I never eat lunch, but my husband loves the burgers, gyros, & today's choice... the California Ranch Club. We cannot say enough about the service. Everyone here is friendly and they try to make the customer feel like old friends. Expect a short wait on weekend mornings, but I assure you the experience  is worth it!"}
{"text":"Been here twice now. Everything we've tried so far on the menu is good. Huge portions. Service is great too. One of our favorite breakfast place now."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here twice.  The servers are quite attentive and the restaurant is clean and new.   Sunday we both had pancakes.  Mine were the buttermilk and he got the blueberry.  Both were terrible!  Mine were tough and hard to cut and he said if he had his eyes closed he wouldn't have been able to tell what he was eating.  Absolutely tasteless.  I doubt we will be back."}
{"text":"Very delicious breakfast.  My honey had the meat lover and I had the Irish omelette.  No complaints!   My waitress, Sammy was articulate and just plain awesome.  She took our order and it came out as requested!  Love my hash browns and toast brown and crisp and guess what, served to me that way!  Love it when you get what you ordered!  Very large portions, could have shared."}
{"text":"This is our new go to place for breakfast. The food is absolutely delicious. It doesn't taste like they just rushed it and gave it to you. Fresh tasting coffee and refreshing orange juice. The service was superb as well. The seating is spacious as well even on a busy day you won't have to worry about people bumping into you while eating. Great decor, awesome servers. Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"The breakfast selection is many. The menu is creative and hits every craving a person could have. For those who want basics, They have it. The prices are about 15$ per person with a drink. The french toast breakfast is three big cowboy bread slices. The carnivore omelet was full. Breakfast potatoes are the mashed potato type. Yum"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our lunch here. The food was quite good, the portions very generous and our server, Serena very attentive. Plus, I always have to give a shout out to a place that serves fresh-squeezed orange juice!!"}
{"text":"I had the Pancho Omelette, and it was great! The service was wonderful as was the decor ans atmosphere! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast I have had since I moved to Arizona.  I love this place, I am always greeted with a smile and a friendly face when I come in, and the decor is so fun. Sunnys makes you feel like family and I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We loved treating ourselves to breakfast at the Tempe location, so when we saw you were coming to Chandler...we were excited! Went for breakfast and were not disappointed! I had the traditional eggs Benedict...my favorite breakfast and partner had the Protein Powder Pancakes with a side of two eggs and sausage.  And I had to get one buttermilk pancake to satisfy that pancake craving I had! Portion sizes are huge and the quality of the food was fantastic! Loved the two young ladies helping us...great experience overall and we will be regulars!  Someone in another review complained about the potatoes not being crispy...we learned that in most places you have to request they be cooked that way and Sunny's did not disappoint...as you will see from pictures! If we request them extra crispy and they still come out wimpy...then we complain.  What gave it the 5 star? We asked for ice water to go and she brought in plastic cups...not styrofoam!"}
{"text":"We've become regulars! Friendly and efficient staff.   The portions are large, so count on bringing food home.   I'm addicted to their \"Power Pancakes\" that are filled with almonds, blueberries, and other goodness."}
{"text":"This place was amazing when I first started coming. They have a delicious option called the country breakfast. Being able to get eggs any style* was something I considered a real luxury. Many places do not accommodate such a thing. When I came here for the first time and they allowed me to get two eggs scrambled and one egg over easy, I really appreciated it. So, we told my family to come. The second time I made this request the waitress took my order with absolutely no question.   Today, the waitress (who was excellent) told me that my order was discussed by management yesterday. According to their manager my request (which I have told other people is my reason for being a customer of Sunny's) of 2 scrambled and 1 over easy for their country breakfast was not possible.   In the past two days I have spent at least 80 dollars here and have brought 7 new customers to this establishment. If it is no longer possible to accommodate what seems like a simple request that has been honored in the past, then I will no longer be coming to this establishment.   Upon my first my review would have been five stars, but after this unfortunate change for lack of consistency, it has changed to a two.   I'd like to add that the service by the wait staff is always excellent, which is greatly appreciated.  This review in no way reflects my experience with them."}
{"text":"Great food with real ingredients. Very Clean and updated inside. There is a full patio outside. Friendly welcoming staff to boot! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The Bisquits and gravy sadly left me feeling much to still be desired. Their portions are huge, but the ratios are off. My Bisquits and gravy had very little sausage in the gravy, and the Bisquits themselves we're larger than necessary. My GF got the Greek scramble. It sounds really good on paper, but when we received it, it was 75% potatoes.   Great coffee and super nice staff, but sadly was not impressed with their massive mostly carbohydrate breakfast plates. Id rather have quality over quantity"}
{"text":"This was probably the worst service I have EVER received in AZ! I called to put my name to be seated, ahead of time. I get there and the host said they don't take reservations. Then I call and the manager to say to him \" why would you even allow me to put my name on that list if you don't take reservations \" POOR COMMUNICATION WITHIN THEIR TEAM!  I would have been fine if he would have said something like  \" oh, don't worry we will find a seat for you guys\" ( it's just TWO of us) but no instead the manager said \" why don't you come back DURING THE WEEK or when it's NOT busy and I'll make it up to you .  Horrible! I'm so mad!"}
{"text":"The service was really good. We were seated quickly and our server was very friendly. The menu had a huge selection. I thought the food was pretty good. The California Benedict and the omelettes were really tasty. But I think the home Fries were kind of lacking in flavor. Overall, breakfast went well."}
{"text":"Excellent spot that I stumbled onto casually looking for a quick breakfast. The space is very bight and clean, very modern and on trend. The space was busy but there was plenty of seating and the waitresses seemed unflustered and were very friendly. I sat at the bar and had coffee before I could remove my jacket.   There menu is expansive but not expensive. Typically my expectations for strip mall breakfast and lunch is pretty low, but I was very surprised by how good my Greek hash was. The meat was very well cooked and obviously a labor of love to make. My only feedback is the taztiki sauce they serve with the hash isn't really needed at all and the biscuit was a bit too generous in size. I'm a big guy and the portions were large even for me!  If you are in the area, even if you aren't, this is a rock solid spot for a meal and is worth stoping in!"}
{"text":"Food is basic and sort of bland. I ate at the counter and had great service so that was a bonus. If you want a quick breakfast this place does the trick."}
{"text":"Cute interior decor and I had high hopes of a tasty breakfast place near home but sadly a disappointment. The actual Eggs Benedict was tasty but nothing extraordinary. I liked that you could opt for tomato slices instead of potatoes but when they came they were mushy and far past ripe - not tasty at all. My coffee wasn't refilled until my bill came which was also disappointing. When I mentioned to my server she said \"oh sorry\" but nothing more. Sadly, will not be returning."}
{"text":"We've eaten here twice and both times the food has been excellent. Service is always very attentive. This last time my wife was trying to figure out to eat and Nessa helped point her in the right direction on the menu and made the experience great. I would recommend giving this place a try if you haven't been there yet."}
{"text":"Very nice modern and clean place. Their omelete were really good...so as their pancakes. I ordered the side of onion ring and was so delicious. The service was average and I will be returning back again."}
{"text":"My husband talked about this place so I figured I have to try it right? We went there the other day and it was pretty good. I had eggs Benedict and hashbrowns. I really didn't like the hashbrowns too much because they were more like smashed potatoes I think that's why they call them home potatoes. Either way I wasn't a fan of the potatoes but the eggs Benedict were to die for! My husband said that he had gotten the Bubba Gump omelette and he said it was the best omelette he has had in his life! Overall not a bad breakfast place a little pricey though but I'll be back"}
{"text":"We came based on other Yelp reviews and were not disappointed. The breakfast we all had was awesome. We came on a Saturday morning, and were so filled up that we skipped lunch. This place put my wife in a food coma. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I gave Sunny's a try for the first time and can happily say that I will be back. The service was excellent the food was great I recommened the Chicken Fried Steak. I'd like to thank our waitress Jen in particular for giving us a great first experiance at this establishment."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and now have a new favorite breakfast place. Had their chicken fried steak with biscuits and gravy...awesome!  Steak had a nice crispy exterior but the steak itself had a great flavor you could taste even with the gravy (which was also delicious).  My friend had the bananas and walnuts waffle.  The waffle was delicious, light on the inside but nice crispiness on the outside.   Loved the food and the service was great. Jannelle was attentive and very helpful. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"This was our first time going and we were very pleased!! The decor is modern with an open space idea. The coffee is bold and delicious and served in a cute yellow mug. My husband and I shared the Greek omelet with the home fries and corn tortillas.  It all tasted as if it were made at home with so much flavor!! Everyone employed here works as a team to serve you, from taking your order, to topping off your coffee, it works! We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I drive by this place every day and there is always cars in the parking lot which is a good sign.  The layout of the place is a little different but its very new and clean. They have the typical breakfast / lunch menu but randomly have spaghetti which made me want to try next time. We went on a Friday around 11 they were some what busy seated right away. Food was great but it a lot longer to come out than I expected.  The servers were nice and refills were quick they offer flavored creamer. I would come again but not when they are busy I would assume it would be slower"}
{"text":"Food was great! The chorizo is definitely work getting. Staff was prompt and friendly. Typically priced for a brunch spot -- $$ medium priced. Inner decor was refreshing and pretty."}
{"text":"This is a cute little breakfast spot. Clean and speedy service. The food was so good and the fresh squeezed OJ was a plus. It's a little pricey, but you get a lot of deliciousness for your buck. No joke, my boyfriend & I shared an omelette cause the portions were huge. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We really like coming here. The service is always good, the food is always delicious and we're normally in and out in under an hour. We were just here 3 days and it was delicious as usual."}
{"text":"Service was not great. Very slow and the server was not friendly. Half of our order came out later. Water glass was dirty and had to call another server to get it replaced."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Sunny's but I won't be the last. Everything was delicious and cooked perfectly, which is so very rare at the many breakfast places in the area. Service was great and portions were about twice the size of normal! Fresh squeezed orange juice and they grind the coffee fresh for every pot.  Very good new place!"}
{"text":"Casey is a great manager! Restaurant was very clean, open, and inviting. Can't wait to visit again."}
{"text":"Good breakfast. The place is clean and cute. The staff is friendly and helpful. Great service here. My server made suggestions when I asked, checked on me a few times and offered me a cup of coffee to go when she brought the check. Good job ladies! Keep it up.   The food was good, as ordered. Hot and tasty. I had the Belgium waffle and eggs and bacon. I know, nothing fancy ;). The waffle was light and fluffy and a little crispy on the outside. Just as it should be, in my opinion.   I'll be back! This is a new favorite.  I can't wait to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Had a pretty nice breakfast, staff was super friendly, I ordered the chocolate chip pancakes with over medium eggs and home fries.  The potatoes were a little bland and the chocolate chip pancakes were too sweet they're definitely better than other big chain pancakes though.  I drank water so didn't try the OJ or coffee but I'll be back so....next time"}
{"text":"Biscuits and Gravy were Dry and biscuit tasted old and stale . Pancakes were delicious and my daughter enjoyed her meal aswell . Overall it was ok. I'll give it another try sometime down the road . Oh and the orange juice was delicious freshly squeezed"}
{"text":"Food and service was good but for a breakfast / lunch place they are way over priced. $32 for 2 people to have some eggs coffee and sausage was a little much. They do have good food but I could get pretty much the same stuff at a chain place for 1/2 the price."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Dealt with the construction and loved the food. Fast and friendly service and the price is reasonable! The skillets are not sizzling skillets they are a dish but they are well worth it! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Service was awesome! Breakfast is served all day. I tried the chicken fried steak with crispy home fried potatoes with an English muffin. The gravy was good, the chicken fried steak had a nice crisp. I am not a fan of the home fries, it was mostly over cooked pieces of potato. Next time I won't get them crispy. There will be a next time. The water; I would recommend that they invest in a charcoal filter. I could taste nothing but chlorine. The coffee would also benefit, it was average at best. Admittedly I am a bit of a coffee snob.  For breakfast an outstanding restaurant. Four stars, fix the water."}
{"text":"Nice little diner, very clean, not too noisy. Super friendly staff and excellent service. Good menu - typical diner food.  Excellent coffee, average food...good but a little on the bland side.  Prices above average, but that's happening most places these days.  We'd visit again!"}
{"text":"Found a great place for brunch today!  The reviews were right, great food and excellent service which is getting harder to find these days.  My husband and I will be back"}
{"text":"Everything was good but I went there specifically for the fresh squeezed orange juice and they were out. Waw waw waw."}
{"text":"My honey and I went here for Sunday brunch. Totally worth the wait. Chicken picado pita was the most amazing deliciousness. Portions were large. Service was great. Prices are really reasonable, wide variety (something for everyone menu). Great coffee. Cannot wait to go back and try other things, but on the other hand that pita was SO good I may just keep coming back for that. Not much to look at and if you blink you may pass it by, but don't! Totally worth stopping in for."}
{"text":"Big portions! Had the Spinach Florentine..oh so yummy and those home fries are to die for! Staff are very friendly and was seated right away, around 10ish so no wait at all. Did I tell you those home fries are amazing? Goes so well with your meal. Hubby had the country fried steak and my son had the lumber jack meal. Willl definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Chocolate banana pancakes-YUM! I could only eat half of one and it comes with 2. Also ordered the biscuits and gravy which was classic-fluffy biscuit and sausage gravy. Restaurant itself isn't very inviting and lacks any color or theme but would come back for food."}
{"text":"The place to go for breakfast ! First time there and the service and food were good. The place is clean and the food hot . We had the Green Chile omelet and 2 Country fried steak breakfast meals. Yes it was tasty . The tea was even nice . Our server did a great good at keeping our drinks filled and needs meet will be back again ."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Fresh squeezed OJ is always amazing. The service is quick and friendly, the food is fresh and delicious, and did I mention fresh squeezed orange juice?! Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Very big portions.. we could have shared our breakfast.. everyone didn't finish their plate.. the food was pretty good and service was good as well.. they do have variety of food to choose from."}
{"text":"We had the Mexican Skillet - I was expecting a sizzling skillet - but it was just a porcelain dish.  It was OK but not exceptional.  Next time we will have to try some of the other fare. The place is very clean, the seating obviously new and comfortable.  The color scheme is fairly subdued ... with a name like Sunny's the owners might consider a bright yellow accent color on wall hangings and such.  We had to travel several miles to get here, so not really a destination breakfast but fine as neighborhood one. If you live close be sure to try. Unfortunately we are looking for the perfect breakfast place with great ambiance - like La Bicycletta in Carmel, California, that has a bicycle hanging out front, a wood fired oven in back, copper pots hanging here and there, and a tree branch with a stuffed bird in the front window."}
{"text":"Sunny's was really cute on the inside. It reminded me of a big modern kitchen with the best part, chalkboards.  The staff was major overly helpful. Honey babe had coffee and they came around and asked if she wanted a refill at lest 7 or 8 times while we were there. The staff acted as a team with everyone taking on the same workload working all tables together. It was pretty dope to see. In all fairness it was really slow but still you can barely get great service from the 1 waiter you get let alone the whole staff. They got 5 stars just for their amazing service.  I ordered huevo ranchero which had eggs with salsa added, refried beans, fried potatoes and 2 tortillas. Very good. The salsa is dope.  Love ordered the Farmers skillet with broccoli and rye bread.   We both loved it. Thanks Sunny."}
{"text":"Clean store, friendly service, huge and diverse menu, and delicious food! I got the Pancho omelette with home fries and wheat toast. All freshly made and well done. Wife ordered the pineapple upside down pancakes and loved them. Melt in your mouth deliciousness! We will be back. Orange juice is also freshly squeezed. They also ground their coffee for every brew - it was awesome!   In addition to a lot of tables, there's seating at the bar and patio."}
{"text":"Will never return. Sent our food back multiple times as it was cold. What we did get was barely edible. The only positive thing was our server was nice however they stated that they would discount the bill 10% but when the bill came they only took $1.00 off.  So I paid $46.00 for food that might as well been pulled out of a garbage can. Spoke with the manager who offered to rerun my card to give me $3.00 dollars off my bill. What a joke."}
{"text":"Bright inside with minimalistic design and enticing food-related pictures on the wall. It's clean and all servers are smiling and happy. They have fresh-squeezed orange juice; I know because I'm an OJ snob and make my juice at home, too. I had the Mediterranean omelette: bacon, spinach, mushrooms, scallions, Parmesan and Swiss cheese!  It was served piping hot, so you know it was made fresh. It goes without saying it was delicious, too.    They have a great menu: homemade spaghetti, Monte Cristo sandwiches, gyros,  a variety of eggs Benedict, even liver!  They also have your standard American breakfast fare. You can't lose with their eclectic selection of American, Greek, and Mexican twists on breakfast and lunch.   Highly recommended and the prices are great for the amount of food you're getting. I'm taking my leftovers home for breakfast tomorrow or late night snack.   If only they were open for dinner!  But they are still new so hopefully demand will change. Go now!"}
{"text":"Food is ok but the service is bizarre! One person seats you and asks what you want to drink, another person brings your drink but isn't a waiter so you have to then wait for someone to take your order. It is not efficient at all! This was my second chance visiting this place, hoped the first was a fluke but sadly it was the same."}
{"text":"Yeppers there's a Sheriff in town serving breakfast and I'm happy to have them so close by. The wait staff must eat sunshine for breakfast, very friendly and attentive. I'll be trying different breakfast items and I have a feeling they may end up with 5 stars. If you even think of going to that \"Pancake\" place read my review on them and go here for happy people and awesome breakfast"}
{"text":"Food good, nice and polite staff, especially Casey. Place is very clean, very good coffee. However their policy of people wanting outside seating or counter seating having to wait in order of those wanting to seat inside is absolutely RIDICULOUS...suggestion...have a list for outside and inside...or have a sign stating parties of 3 or less seat yourself at the counter; NOWHERE have I ever heard of waiting for counter..as a prior restaurant owner..and if patrons can't decide inside or outside they are your problem...people who choose outside or counter  don't want to wait ...other than this issue it's a good place with good people, good food, and very good coffee..."}
{"text":"Found this place after getting a pedi and mani since it was nearby. If you like big portions for a good price this place is for you. My bf and I ordered 2 omelettes and we both didnt finish. We didnt know the portions were big. Its a good thing though so we have leftovers. Service was okay. I just wish she wouldve checked on us more often but thats ok. We will be back though. Food was good and you cant beat the price on their breakfast for a huge meal.."}
{"text":"Nice modern-diner with a friendly staff. Went in for a late lunch on Saturday and the food was pretty good.  Ordered breakfast only ( other's lunch plates looked good too) Shrimp omelette was alright but I'd go back and try the other menu items. The hollandaise sauce tasted homemade and was very good. The \"guy\" got a ck fried steak in a burrito.. which he gives it. 3.5 stats and he'd order it again."}
{"text":"DoorDash order..... I ordered breakfast for a family of 5 for delivery. We ordered a variety of foods. Eggs breakfast, waffles , pancakes & omelets.  Food was delivered hot as if we were at the restaurant a little flipped around but hot. We all shared a little of everything. The food was so good we were almost singing while eating. I was very satisfied with our breakfast and no one was disappointed."}
{"text":"First visit today. Seems like a newer place so its neat & clean. Waitstaff was friendly and efficient. Food was good and I like that they cooked the hashbrowns extra crispy. Pricing was high as bfast for two was $27!"}
{"text":"Really did enjoy this place, not quite a 5 star place yet but it has awesome potential and a great menu!   Sat down at the breakfast bar as soon as we walked in, about 10 tables full. About 1/10 of the capacity. Not very busy for a Saturday morn. There is construction all over so its understandable that it's a bit slow and it's a new place.  place is brand new! very clean, very peppy staff. everyone is clicking on all cylinders. the manager seems to know what he's doing as well, always checking on everyone and everything. i thought the prices were very reasonable. my wife got the loaded biscuits and gravy and was surprised how delicious it was, this is a person who rarely like new places. I had eggs Benedict, it was not the best, but it was good and i would order it again.  all in all, this place is great!  I will definitely come back and check its consistency"}
{"text":"Love the Western Scramble.  One order can fill 2 adults if split.  Our waitress, 'Nessa, was very friendly."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place. The portions are large and tasty. I had the Egg Benedict and the the avocado slices felt like a whole avocado. The services was excellent and friendly ! I recommend trying it out. They also own Sunny's at McClintock and University."}
{"text":"\"What nicer thing can you do for somebody than make them breakfast?\" ? Anthony Bourdain  What truer words.  Here at Sunny's, they do things right.  I got the Chicken Fried Steak with over easy eggs and some rye bread.  It's not going to win any awards for the the prettiest dish but it was tasty and it got me going for the rest of the day.  The seasoning was spot on, the eggs were cooked absolutely perfect, and the home style fries were a delight.  I love being able to stab into the yolks and watching it ooze everywhere.  I wish my chicken fried steak was a little crispier though but who doesn't love extra gravy?    I also got to try some of the Bubba Gump Omelette and it too was delicious.  The toast on that dish was burnt though so that was a bit of a bummer.  And $5 for a large fresh squeezed orange juice?  Yikes.  Can I get a side of champagne with that at least?  I jest... but it would be pretty great if they served some mimosas. ;D  Good portions, decent prices, and not a bad breakfast!  There were quite a few items on the menu I'd love to come back and try."}
{"text":"Went to Sunny's for the first time this morning.  The menu was stacked with items to choose from, went with the traditional biscuits and gravy.  I have to say, I love biscuits and gravy, I was trying to think of any place I enjoyed them more and I couldn't think of any.  I hesitate to say they were the best I've ever had because the memory isn't as good as it used to be.  They are amazing, can't go wrong coming here for breakfast."}
{"text":"This breakfast restaurant was very good. Great food, great service. Fresh squeezed orange juice. Clean restaurant. Would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Great place for chill breakfast. The coffee is fresh, not bitter and people circulate often to top you off. Large menu with lots of healthy and tasty options. Waitstaff was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Pancho Omelet, fruit, and wheat toast from sunny's. My go-to breakfast. The chorizo has just enough kick.  The fruit is fresh. My friends and I can't get enough of this place. The staff is the best, even when they're busy. They all help each other out and are nice to both each other and the customers."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast. Eggs cooked prefectly. Huge biscuit and gravy portion and the gravy is nicely seasoned...doesn't taste like a bag mix which is nice. Friendly service and comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"This breakfast spot serves everything from traditional breakfast to made it yourself omelet; pancakes to waffles. If you like drinking your coffee with French vanilla creamer, they have it! Service is great and a lady (who was not our server) came by at least 4 times to check up on us. Their prices are a bit on the pricey side, but you definitely get what you paid for. General areas are clean and organized (although their folks and knives can be cleaned better). Overall, I enjoy my time and food here."}
{"text":"Holy cow!!!  Breakfast burrito was rock solid!!!  Service was on point and the wife's Huevos Ranchero were awesome!  Only gripe we can make (and it's a REALLY small one), is it's be nice to have more tortillas with the huevos as they're is so much great food.    Keep up the great work and we'll be back.  Update:  Apparently....the servers are less proactive on weekdays...as four of them and apparently the manager decided it was more important to be laughing with earache other than taking our order"}
