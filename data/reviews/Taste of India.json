{"text":"*BE AWARE* For starters, I am an avid Indian food lover and travel to India quite often as I have friends that have family out there. I love the culture and the plethora of cuisine that different regions of India have to offer. Out of the MANY Indian places I have tried throughout Las Vegas, Taste of India is THE WORST facility I have ever tried. There are many reasons why.  First and foremost, the food.  As I entered the place, it was almost completely empty, with only one other table occupied. (they were family of the business). As I chose a table, I walked over to scan the \"buffet\" quickly and was very surprised at what I saw. There was one isle of food, not a great selection to choose from, but just the basics such as chicken korma, tikka masala, jeera rice, etc. All the food I saw looked incredibly unappetizing. I should have left right then and there, but I wanted to give the benefit of the doubt. BIG MISTAKE. I noticed the food that almost no one has touched, literally caked on the sides of the metal bins that they were sitting in. All the food was above the temperature basin therefore it had dried out from it sitting there most likely for HOURS. All the condiments were sitting in melted ice and looked like they were just thrown in their bin. There were also a couple of flies sitting in them. I was utterly disgusted.  At this point I really wanted to feed my insatiable need for Indian food and personally would feel quite bad If I just left this new business. It was a stupid choice that I made. I decided to get the tikka masala and the palak paneer and some rice.  I cannot even describe how bad this excuse for Indian food was. First, all the food that I tried was UNDER PROPER TEMPERATURE. The chicken tikka masala tasted like they mixed canned tomatoes with chicken. It was horrible and room temperature. The palak paneer was not even melted properly and the spinach almost separated from the unknown sauce that it consisted of. What was this?!  The rice was flavorless and mushy but clumping together. This means that chances are that this rice is RECYCLED. It was by no means, fresh. Everything tasted so very bland. I ordered naan, garlic and plain. It looked very fresh when the guy brought it out, but then I noticed that it was still very doughy. It was not even done baking all the way! I started to become very weary of the food that was in front of me, slowly scooping up bite minutes apart and then just giving up. Not even a half hour later I started to feel the effects of FOOD POISONING. Sure enough, it was. I got really sick throughout the day and was vomiting profusely. I was very ill for the next few days unfortunately.   Overall, the food here was a horrible selection of Indian food. The quality is by far a sorry excuse for representing Indian cuisine and these people are INDIAN! I could make a better Indian dish at home and I'm Italian! I am surprised that the health department has not shut down this place for improper food temperatures. People should not be eating here for that reason alone.  I could go on and on about this horrible restaurant, but I feel that people should be aware of places like this who care more about money than the quality of their food and misrepresenting what Indian cuisine is all about. This place is a shame. I will never go there again."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  They are very prompt in both takeout and dining in.  Best Indian food you'll ever taste in Pittsburgh.  I've been a loyal customer for 6 years and this would be my highest recommendation to any first timers in the city."}
{"text":"It may be the best Indian restaurant in Madison. Good food, friendly staff, good location. I will go back. The mushroom tikka masala was particularly interesting if you want a veggie option."}
{"text":"No complaints at all about this place. Great food, exceptional customer service, nice place to dine in and prices are decent. Tandoori fish and chicken pakoras a must try."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Taste of India.  With take out, you get much more food than when you dine in with entrees, but the service is quite good when you eat in.  The buffet is okay, I don't like it because it is for a more mild pallet.  The quality is good for what it is, just a bit bland and unexciting.    I usually get things spiced eight or nine on their ten point scale.  My favorites are the aloo matar and the vegetable curry.  The sagg paneer is good.  Pakora and samosas are both tasty, too.  Puri and nann have always came out hot and fresh.  Their mango lassi and chai tea are both tasty.  For less than thirty bucks, I can get dinner for two people with a satisfying lunch the next day.  Good."}
{"text":"We have been getting take-out from Taste of India frequently for years and we occasionally eat in also.  The portions are generous, the flavors are fantastic, the staff is pleasant and the prices are fair.  Make it your go-to Indian restaurant."}
{"text":"Just moved from Pittsburgh and I miss Taste of India - this place is great."}
{"text":"Ordered off of grub hub and was on the phone with both the restaurant and grub to confirm they did not have the desert we ordered, which was fine, they did offer an alternative. When 40 minutes past our estimated delivery time had past, we called the restaurant. They seemed to have no idea why our food was not there and said they would check into it.  10 minutes later with no response, I called back, there was no answer the next three times. I was on the phone with grub hub, now an hour past delivery time , when the delivery showed up. I was informed they were confused because they've never delivered here before. We paid and collected our food. The food arrived luke warm and mediocre. I specified in the instructions that we would like the dishes extra spicy. They were actually really bland which is disappointing considering how much my husband and I love Indian food. The portions were small and the rice that I paid extra for was almost non existent and flavorless. First time I've ever received disappointing  white rice. I'm extremely upset , and considering the cost, which is expected when ordering Indian cuisine, not worth it. Will never order again."}
{"text":"Taste of India is a staple in our house.  I can't speak for all dishes because we are too hooked on our favorites, which include the chicken tikka masala, raita, garlic and cheese naan, chicken tandoori appetizer (amazing amount of chicken for an appetizer), and beef vindaloo.  The staff is excellent. The chicken tikka is hands down the best in Madison."}
{"text":"Food is at best average.  There are definitely better options.  But that's not the reason I am writing this.  I was recently there and I gotta tell you - the service was AWFUL!!   There is an elderly gentleman there - perhaps the owners dad - who I think will single handedly run this place out of business if my experience was anything to go by.  The guy was hard of hearing and when I had to repeat myself to make sure he understood (No, I was not asking him for his views on the stimulus package - i was asking for more naans), he was indignant insisting that he heard it the first time.     I would have been angry if it was'nt so comical.  Bottom line:  Find a better option"}
{"text":"Their kitchen smells real bad. I din't feel like eating the food after smelling their kitchen while on my way to the restaurant's restrooms."}
{"text":"Great food, pleasant service and very fresh weekend buffet with a wide selection of choices. The carrot dessert is insane. And they're very nice to kids here."}
{"text":"Good, solid, and strangely inexpensive.   While I didn't find Taste of India to be amazingly awesome, its currently in the running for my favorite Indian option in Pittsburgh. Service was fairly attentive, the naan was hot & crispy, and the chicken tikka was really tasty.  A surprise: the veggie samosas have just a bit of spice-- unexpected and fun! Parking can be a challenge due to the location (directly across the street from Children's Hospital), but there are lots of meters around (and parking is free after 6pm)."}
{"text":"I have been to this place this weekend with my fried family. We expected some authentic Indian style food. We ordered chicken biriyani, lamb biriyani, peas pulav and Chicken Pakora, Gulab jam. Biriyani was awful it's taste less. Full of racines. This restaurants is definitely not for South Indians. Maintainance and service was good but food is completely tasteless. Chicken pakora is at best. Papad is awesome. On Biriyani and pees pulav we Wasted money."}
{"text":"Das Taste of India ist ein Restarant mit gemütlichem Ambiente und authentischer indischer Küche. Die Bedienung ist freundlich und hilfsbereit. Außerdem können sie einem Gerichte empfehlen, welche man noch nicht kennt und probieren möchte."}
{"text":"Love their butter chicken!  Great service and good food.  Their lunch buffet is the best value."}
{"text":"This it probably one of my favorite Indian restaurants in Madison. The food is always delicious and the service is always great. I have nothing but positive things to say about this place. If you're in the mood for wonderful Indian food, you should definitely check them out."}
{"text":"My favorite Indian place. Although we eat there often, my husband and I always get the same thing. We share the Vegetarian Platter (mixed appetizers, mmmm) and I get the Paneer Tikka (ahh! the yogurt sauce!), while he has Lamb Pasanda. It's so good we don't want to get anything else.   Recently, we ordered take out with friends, and we also tried their Chicken Makhani. It was much pinker than other chicken makhani I've had (and made), and tasted a little different. It kind of looked like chicken vindaloo or tandoori chicken, but anyway it was really good. Creamy and flavorful but not too spicy.   The service at the restaurant is always fantastic, they constantly refill your water glasses and the food comes quickly. No surprise that even though it is off the beaten path, it is almost always crowded. Someday I hope to try their buffet so we can branch out a little..."}
{"text":"For some odd reason we haven't stopped into this restaurant which coincidentally is down the street from our home. That won't happen again. Although I've made curry and \"indian\" dishes in the past, this gives me something to shoot for the next time my wife and I cook. Service, food, presentation, all that. We had the Vegetarian dinner for two that fit everything we were looking for on a cool spring evening in Madison, WI. Although off the main drag on Monroe Street, this place is worth your time and money."}
{"text":"Taste of India is the real deal.  They are careful to maintain their buffet and replenish frequently.  The quality of every dish is treated as important, and it shows.  They have a lot of the standards, but after several visits, we find it one of the two best in Madison.  Best gulab jammon anywhere.  Service is also well done.  Never a wait.  Even the buffet service is carefully maintained.  This is a simple place, but very well done."}
{"text":"Great food.  great weekend buffet.  Really like the tikka masala dishes, naan, and everything we have tried"}
{"text":"Excellent food, friendly service. I went with a couple friends, one of us eats vegan, one eats kosher and the other just really wanted to eat some lamb that day. We all left VERY happy, and with leftovers. I'd say this is the 2nd best Indian food I've had, after Taj on Park St."}
{"text":"I like this restaurant for a few reasons.  Certainly not for the restaurant itself which is not really inviting and definitely most customers take-out or order through mealsdelivered.net.  What is good is their vegetarian selection, and, more importantly, that vegans can actually eat here with good selections.    I am not vegan though, so I actually order a few things.  I really like their Kabli Nan which is nan with golden raisins and almonds in it.  Totally delicious and like a dessert.  I usually get the paratha (whole wheat, it's better for you!) and chicken vindaloo, which isn't the best I've had - that is reserved for a place in Maryland - but is ok and certainly good value for the amount you pay.  This time around, I also tried the Mango lassi (yum!) and the Kheer (um, don't order that here, there was a weird taste to it).    Overall, the amount of food you get is great for what you pay.  And in general, the food is tasty and spiced decently.  I ordered an 8 in terms of spice and probably really got a 6, but then again, I wasn't there to tell them to make it a REAL 8.  :)  I would definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"I tried to eat here tonight using a $25 gift certificate purchased from Restaurant.com.  After waiting over 15 minutes for my server to stop by for my order, I showed her my gift certificate.  She told me they stopped taking them, however I had just purchased it 15 minutes earlier.    I spoke to the manager and he wasn't the least bit interested.  He told me Restaurant.com was a scam (I have used it before with no problems) and he hasn't been able to get in touch with them to cancel.  While I was still talking to him, he answered a call on his cell phone without even saying excuse me.  He obviously didn't care at all.  I called Restaurant.com for a refund, and told them what he said.  They told me that they have actually been trying to get in touch with the restaurant for weeks.  I can only assume he owes them money or something.  Either way, it is outrageous that he will not honor a gift certificate for a program he agreed to sign up for.  Beyond this problem, I can't recommend this place simply based on how awfully they dealt with this issue.  I didn't get a chance to try any food and I never will."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch this long weekend, no doubt food was great. except some delay in Bread (Naan). servers were great and polite, usually we do take outs from this place, this time we decided to dine in it was a great lunch date. would definitely try them again."}
{"text":"Good day  There was a nice variety of items on the menu to start off with, which was nice for a specialty restaurant. Items such as Veggie Pakora & this Sweet/Spicy cauliflower, very creative creations and refreshing to see on the menu.  The following were ordered with our group: Veggie Pakora, Sweet/Spicy cauliflower (forget the name), Veggie platter, Coconut Rice, Garlic naan, Butter chicken, and Karahi Prawn. Everyone seemed to be enjoying their meal.   I ordered the Sweet/Spicy cauliflower to start of with which was mouth watering & not to spicy. We also order the Veggie Pakora and found them very crispy. The only problem was there was too much and we decided to share to be able to fit our main dish. My main dish was Okra Masala and I asked for it to be very spicy. To be honest it wasn't spicy enough for me but the greens inside were so good and the balance of spices were just as good. My wife had the Baigan Bharta (Eggplant), it had a bit of a kick for her but it was still good because it had lots of greens. Word of advise, do not order to much Naan bread unless you are sharing with the table. I thought we were ordering 4 Naan and it felt like 20 were in there. :)  All in all, it was a good experience. I would suggest new chairs because they feel like broken chairs and you just sink in them. Kinda uncomfortable but a side from that we give it a 4 out of 5. We will for sure be eating there again.   Have a great rest of your week.  Cheers,"}
{"text":"Comparatively mediocre to other indian restos. Not very flavorful. Naan is really thick and dense. Channa masala just tastes like it's chick peas soaked in tomato sauce instead of masala sauce. And daal makhini is similarly too saucy and not in a yummy sauce way. Kind of a bummer since there aren't many indian restaurants in the east end area. So my final thought post-dinner is \"meh.\" And I'm not even excited for the leftovers tomorrow."}
{"text":"The best Indian Restaurant in the casino city! The menu has a wide range of items, both North Indian & South Indian! Cordial hosts and best service. It has been the 'to go' for the time we stayed in Vegas. Visit once and you will be back for more! :)"}
{"text":"Nice place to organisé big function! We celebrated our 25th anniversary with 100+ guest and taste of india provided us magnificent service and food. I have been there several times after that and the food is delicious. All dishes were very tasty and we'll garnished but  I loved Thier chicken Tikka themost which was  fresh and we'll marinated.    I love this place definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Best and most consistent, high quality Indian food in the 'burgh. Everything I've ever had here is delicious, especially the Malia Kofta. Sort of Americanized, rich and creamy style Indian food. If you like spicy food, I'd suggest ordering an \"8\" or a \"9\" on the scale. Great service and clean, classy environment! My mouth is watering just typing about it."}
{"text":"The food and service here is great! The lunch buffet is amazing....I leave there so stuffed with food that I can barely walk. I've gone there for a dinner a few times, and I will say it's a bit pricey but the food is still very good. Check their hours, though, because they close in between lunch and dinner.  Happy eating!"}
{"text":"We are visiting from Portland and found this restuarant to be a top class authentic indian restuarant that has excellent North and South Indian food. The menu is extensive and hence you have many wonderful choices. The food is freshly cooked and is both aromatic and tasty.The prices are also reasonable for the Las Vegas area. We have been Las Vegas locals in the past so we are familar with other well-known offerings in the area (e..g Gandhi, India Oven etc). The food here is as good as or better than the other places that offer indian food. Besides i am originally from India so i can speak to the quality and authenticity of their offerings. Enjoyed the food here and so witll you. The owners are also very friendly and provide advice when you are ordering. That helps very much also pick out the best of the best."}
{"text":"Love this place. And they have coupons too. The bonus is definitely the amount of food, you get enough for delicious lunch leftovers!"}
{"text":"Awesome buffet with plenty of great dishes. Most of the time service is excellent. Only reason no 5 star-Once a female server seemed to be busy on her phone at the bar and never refilled our water. We went up to the bar and grabbed the pitcher and refilled our glasses and she still didn't notice because she was so distracted."}
{"text":"Delicious, intensely flavored food. I've had a variety of chicken, lamb and beef dishes and liked them all. Friendly service, cheapest glass of wine I've seen in a decade, and I even love the anise assorted crunchy things you get with the bill--beats the heck out of starlight mints! They gave me some extra rice to take home with my leftovers. Good naan. Very reasonably priced. Wish I lived close enough to walk but I've always snagged a parking spot, which I attribute to my Squirrel Hill training."}
{"text":"It was more expensive than other Indian places I've been to, but it was good!  We did takeout and they gave us a ton of rice and I order way too much naan.  It was $65 for four of us.    I got the Chicken Tikka Masala and I loved it, my wife got the Chicken Curry, also very good.  The other couple got a shrimp dish and a tilapia dish, which I tried but didn't care for.  I would never have ordered those dishes anyway so I won't count that against them. I would like to try lunch here - I saw a buffet table, so that might be a more cost efficient choice for this place."}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing hospitality. True Indian FOOD!!!"}
{"text":"We go here weekly. This is our absolute favorite Indian restaurant in Madison.  Food is always delicious (the chicken korma is addicting). Friendly service whether we dine in or take out."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good, not the best but close.  Across from Children's hopsital so you have to handle the meter parking but usually spots open.  Staff is very nice and sincere, when you walk in you are not sure what to expect but it is a quaint, clean, comfortable interior with a bit of dress up."}
{"text":"Review #4 of the November 30 day challenge  Something I've noticed is that everyone has different tastes when it comes to their  Indian Food.  Taste of India is my personal favorite!  I have absolutely no problem driving the 40 mins for my take-out.  When you are paying an average of $13/dish you want the best value for your money.  Other Indian places give you 5 or 6 pieces of meat in a beef curry or butter chicken and the rest is sauce, but this place gives you dishes packed with goodness.    The flavor is always perfect.  I love the level of spice (a tad spicier than most places, but if you don't like spice just ask).  Never over-seasoned.  The naan breads are HUGE!  They are easily as long as my forearm.    I love using the online ordering system.  Makes it easy to browse the menu and take your time to make choices.  They call within minutes of submission of the order to see when you want your order and to make sure it is correct.  They are always friendly and eager to please.  If you're looking for a new Indian place, I highly recommend giving this place a shot!  Review #4 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012"}
{"text":"Great Indian food away from the chaos and the crowds of The Strip. We had 8 adults and 2 kids and the food and prices were both excellent. Casual atmosphere and lots of seating that is perfect for family style sharing. Chicken Tikka Masala, Saag Paneer, Fish Korma, Vegetable Samosas, and Lassis were all as good as you can find in any good Indian place in big cities."}
{"text":"I would have to say that this is some of the best Indian I've had in pittsburgh so far. The staff were friendly and attentive.   The chicken korma was delicious. It had almonds and raisins in it, which complemented the sauce nicely.   The check comes in a tray with candy coated fennel seeds. We didn't know it was edible until our server said to try some. I liked it because I like black licorice. Also, our server explained that it helps to cleanse the palette after a spicy meal.   The prices were on point. The seats and tables were new and comfortable."}
{"text":"My go to India place in Madison.  Flavors are all there and the service is spot on.  Take out is fast and dinning in is a pleasure.  Good nice staff as well."}
{"text":"I used to really like this restaurant, however, I doubt we will go back again anytime soon.  The service was fine aside from the fact That there seemed to be only two people working there. The woman was friendly and checked in on us a lot.  The price was high considering the food was only ok. This used to be one of three Indian food places I enjoyed in AZ  5 years ago. I Recently moved back and wanted to revisit the delicious cheese pakora and samosas I loved.  The food, well papadam was great, cheese pakora was good but I felt like it was lacking in flavor. The samosa and aloo ghobi had far too much onion for my taste, which I cannot stand, but it was the least onion-y thing on the menu. The rice and the naan were perfect and the cheese naan was great as well. My iced tea was flavorful and had a nice cinnamon aftertaste. I didn't have any, but my date said the chicken tikka misala was amazing. The music was nice, and there was a cool looking Bollywood movie playing by the bar. It was not too loud and was not busy at all.  Overall, it would have been wonderful if the place was kept up a bit more, less onions, and the prices more reasonable."}
{"text":"We order take out from here often.  Now that they have started a lunch buffet during the week, we have started walking to the restaurant to eat.  The buffet is much larger than many other Indian buffets we have visited and the items change often.  My wife and I both consider this one of our favorite Indian restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"This place has an incredible lunch buffet.  It's cheap and there's tons of delicious food.  They don't deliver, I don't think, but you can order takeout.  Definitely worth it, especially if you work in the area."}
{"text":"Ordering online was terrible as they were having tech issues so best to order over the phone so nothing gets lots to the Internet!  They were very apologetic for the issues we had with the online ordering and gave us one of our dishes for free.   We always love the vegetable manchurians!  Cannot comment on the dine in experience as we have only ever had takeout!"}
{"text":"I'm an admitted Indian food neophyte, so take this review for what it's worth, but I did really enjoy the food at TOI.  Ok, so the server wasn't super \"warm and fuzzy\" and didn't slap on a ridiculously fake smile the entire time, but he got us what we ordered in a timely manner and was somewhat pleasant about it.    Parking was abundant and the atmosphere was kitschy, but it was clean.  The portions did seem a bit small, but let's face it, Americans are used to wheelbarrow sized portions!  I definitely had enough to eat and it was really good.  I would definitely make a return visit to TOI."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars instead of 1 is their naan bread was fantastic.  I'm hungry and craving some Indian food, so I stop in.  I'd eaten here a few years ago and thought it was pretty good but not great.  So I go in and the lady at the counter who is none too welcoming tells me to go sit \"whereever\".  So I do, assuming she will bring me some water and then I'll go to the buffet.  But I'm sitting there for a while, about to just go to the buffet when she comes over and rudely says \"You can go get a plate.\"  I'm wondering if I've offended her in some way but as I haven't really said or done anything, I figure not.  As I go to fill up my plate, I (and the entire restaurant) hear her yelling into the kitchen and the tone was not friendly.  Someone yells back, also not in friendly or joking tones.  Now, I look at the items in the buffet, and it looks pretty sparse.  Granted, the place hadn't just opened, it was after 1.  But still.  Rice, a chicken korma, a spinach dish, a vegetarian dish, maybe two sad pieces of tandoori chicken, no onions or lemon with in.  But, I figure, maybe they had a lunch rush and maybe I'm spoiled into having a larger variety.  I check out the \"salad\" part of the buffet, pretty standard stuff.  The food was very bland, even for me who doesn't like really spicy.  All the food seemed to have a similar flavor to it.  Then I tasted one of the relishes- bad idea- I had to spit it out it was so noxious.  I'm not even sure what it was,maybe something with olives (my husband is constantly amazed that I will eat things I don't recognize) but it was bad, bad, bad!  Inedible.  Heinous.  At this point, I'm really wishing the waitress/greeter would bring me the water I still haven't received so I can get this awful taste out of my mouth.  She comes over and I politely ask her for water and if the buffet comes with naan bread which I see other customers eating.  She says yes and stomps away.  She brings me water finally and a few minutes LATER I see her order some naan bread from the kitchen.  So I'm done with my meal and eventually she brings the bread, which, I will say right now, was outrageously good.  So good I'm considering going back even though the meal itself was pretty terrible and the service worse.  I go back to the buffet, convinced I've maybe missed something- like the really great milky tea or rice pudding some Indian buffets serve, but no.  I'm out of luck.  To top it off, I go over to pay, and I compliment the lady on the naan bread, to which she says nothing but tells me to wait there.  I wait while she and several others clean up the entire buffet!  After they are done, she comes over and does me the favor of letting me pay.    I couldn't really believe this experience, it was almost comical.  Like one of those restaurants where it's their \"thing\" to be rude to the patrons....well, I  will probably not be going back here even for the naan."}
{"text":"I came one day for the lunch buffet as it was my first time eating indian food. Lunch is buffet only. The food was very good and fresh. I highly enjoyed the multiple dishes I had. Would def. go back/again."}
{"text":"Really good food with great service. I first went there with a friend of mine for lunch. They have vast selection of vegetarian food, which is amazing.   Their buffet is really value for money. Definitely try their naan bread."}
{"text":"I did the lunch buffet. The food was pretty mediocre. Nothing was bad, necessarily, but nothing was that great, either. The chili chicken was very disappointing - not spicy at all. In fact, nothing was spicy. The tandoori chicken and chicken tikka were so-so. The gulab jamuns were tasty, though. It was nice that this place was open on Christmas, but I'm going to continue my search for a good Indian restaurant in Madison."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. Pittsburgh does not know how to make any food correct, let alone the complexity of Indian cuisine.  This city is the dumpster of the eastern U.S.  Do not go here, do not ever go to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"So happy that these guys have finally reopened! I went there for dinner a few nights ago and really enjoyed it. I got the Tandoori chicken, which was moist and flavorful. My boyfriend got a mushroom and potato dish which was also excellent. Servings are huge, and prices are low!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and a very large menu. The portions are tremendous and the prices are very reasonable. We took home enough for another meal. We will be back."}
{"text":"Compared to other ethnic eats in Pittsburgh, Taste of India, frankly, doesn't fare too well.  Don't get me wrong: the food is good, the service is great, and if you're already in the Bloomfield area, it's a fine choice for dinner.  But, there are a few unfortunate and glaring errors that prevent Taste of India from being much more than an average-level restaurant.  First and foremost, I've tried just about everything I can imagine, and I can't seem to get Taste of India to actually serve me *spicy* food.  I'm a huge fan of vindaloo, which is often the spiciest item on an Indian menu (at least in the United States), but at Taste of India, it's about as spicy as a can of Chef Boyardee Ravioli.  I've tried asking for a spicy level of 11 on a scale of one to ten.  I've tried asking for \"traditional Indian\" heat.  No dice.  Chef Boyardee Vindaloo, every time.  Another problem is the take-out ordering process.  My wife and I have ordered take-out a couple times recently, and each time, we placed two orders for naan and only received one.  Since we live in Point Breeze, going back to the restaurant for $3 worth of naan isn't worth the effort, but really, we should have just received the naan in the first place.  Given these issues, why do we keep going back to Taste of India?  Simple: the biryani and korma are the best dishes this side of Stanwix Street.  And, that's saying quite a lot... or at least enough to keep this review at three stars instead of two."}
{"text":"Won't be going back here anymore. Every time we go, prices go up and portions go down. We ordered a butter chicken among other things, and in the dish there was maybe 6 pieces of chicken chunks. There Naan also is half the size as it used to be. Not worth the money."}
{"text":"Difficult to beat the buffet.  The price is good and so is the food.  Filling, good flavor, replenished frequently, and good variety.  The sauce can be a bit heavy and thick but that is necessary at a buffet to keep the food from drying out in the heated hotel pans.  Really, nothing bad to say.  Wish I could visit more often."}
{"text":"Delicious food! The decor is a little lacking, but the food was so outstanding that I have to give it 5 stars. We had 3 types of bread, along with goat mango curry, chana masala, and chicken tikka masala. All of these were excellent, with fresh flavor and nuanced taste. We asked for a spice level of 8, and the spice was spot on.  Flavors were so without being muddled.   I would definitely, definitely return next time I come to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"This is my family's favorite Indian place in Madison. The food is always delicious, and the staff remember us and out usual orders and we are treated like family. You can also order carry out and the food is just as good. The decor is a little outdated. The carpet could use an update."}
{"text":"This place is great! Went with my girlfriend full bar, excellent service and even better food. We will be returning again must try the Gulab Jamun for dessert. Excellent view"}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying that Indian buffets are just average!  If you really want to experience the quality, go for ordering off the menu.  It is not fair to rate any place based on the buffet only.  So, if you want some amazing Indian food, give Taste of India a try.  We ordered a variety of entrees with a spice level of 10, we were not disappointed.  The heat was there, but you still could taste the delicious meat and spices.  The serving size is very large, so be prepared!  Love the food and service."}
{"text":"This place is really not that great for three key reasons (I had the buffet) - The food lacks that unique spice that Indian restaurants cook up so well. All of the food is just blah. The chicken tikka masala (typically a dish that restaurants get super creative with in terms of spices) tasted like it had tomato paste on it. - The buffet lacked all paneer (cheese) dishes! - There is a dearth of good desserts- crucial to any indian meal  The place was empty when we walked in, we saw one other customer in the hour that we were there. Just not one of those indian gems but fine is you want \"blah indian\"."}
{"text":"First time coming here! And I can say since thy just opened it was a little quiet and weird. But once the food was served it was definetly worth it. Great taste in food and good portions."}
{"text":"Hands down the best place to go for Indian buffer in the north west of the city. The overall atmosphere is great. I love the artwork, but mostly the food is great"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Indian restaurant in Madison. I love lunch buffet. There are a lot of delicious vegetarian choices.  Lentil soup. Samosas. Vegetable Korma. Saag paneer. They provide great service too. One time they did not have saag paneer and my 4 year old was very disappointed. They responded by making it special for her."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Pittsburgh is not exactly the mecca of ethnic eating so the fact that there is not only an Indian restaurant but a very good Indian restaurant near me is fantastic.  As good or better and more consistent than Indian restaurants on Devon in Chicago.  Good variety, good flavor, good portions, nice owner(I have never asked, but I assumed she is the owner). Only complaint is that naan needs to be a little more consistent."}
{"text":"Taste of Indian has the best naans that I've ever had. I've been to two of their locations and both had the same insanely good naan. My favorite types are the sun dried tomato and the potato. I wasn't too impressed with their buffet, which looked kind of sad. I often get some naan breads to go and make a meal out of them. They're huge, cheap, freshly cooked, and absolutely delicious. Five stars for that!"}
{"text":"My experience with taste of India has been positive. Their food is solid. I love the complexities of their Malia Kofta dish; the sliced almonds and raisins add excellent texture and bursts of sweetness to a savory dish. Mango Lassi's are a must have here. I may be a little obsessed with mango and yogurt in general, but that doesn't mean the average patron will not love this sweet drink.   The family who owns Taste of India is very accommodating and their updated facade creates a more welcoming environment for Children's hospital goers and employees as well as for locals like myself. Anything that continues to revitalize my neighborhood is a plus. This restaurant has been around for years and I appreciate their efforts to stay in the game. Quality Ethnic food + walking distance to my home= love."}
{"text":"A great place for Indian in Bloomfield and the surrounding neighborhoods. The give good food portions and they have some very good onion and garlic naans. I am also fond of their samosas and chicken vindaloo."}
{"text":"i used to eat at this place every month back in 2005-2007, since then they have completely gone down hill. really slow service and the quality has faded, i feel badly i hope they can fix that soon."}
{"text":"Whenever I need a great lunch and am in the area I always stop in for their buffet.  Great food, lots of it and comfy seating.  The staff is always pleasant.  Good value."}
{"text":"2.0/5 - tikka masala: great sauce, dry chicken (end of lunch buffet) 3.0/5 - curry chicken  Good service, brought out fresh naan near the end of lunch."}
{"text":"Never tried Indian food before. This was a slam dunk! We got the mango lassi, veg samosa and chicken jalfrezi and it was all delicious. I highly recommend this place and I will be back!"}
{"text":"The staff/owners? seem nice but the food is not that good. I had shrimp tandoori  which tasted and looked like the shrimp was soaked in red dye and the vegetables were not grilled at all. No flavor. We also had a masala and that too was not great. I just returned from Princeton, NJ and had a GREAT India food experience. This was not nearly as good. Lastly the naan is doughy. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I honestly can't say what most of the menu is like, because the Chicken Makhani, Lamb Bhartha, and Peshwari Naan are so perfect that the clouds part and little putti sing from on high when I eat them. I really should try something else, but why mess with a good thing? Creamy and probably bad for me, but then why do the putti appear? I love this place."}
{"text":"Even though it's right in our town, we don't go here anymore. The buffet is super bland. This seems common in CT. The staff reported they make the food bland intentionally to appeal to people who don't actually enjoy Indian food."}
{"text":"Went there with friends for the first time and felt quite disappointed. Ordered mango shrimp and my wife the chicken tika masala. Food was dry and the sauces were watery. The waiters were removing our dishes and ready to clean our table off the minute we put our forks down, despite there being many available tables that night. I don't know why all the hype on this place. Being across children's hospital gives them great business but quality of food is fair at best. Best thing was the bottle of King fisher beer I had."}
{"text":"Please do yourself a favour and look at the restaurant's inspection results on the AHS website. They were shutdown on August 22, 2013 for numerous violations. I have done takeout from here before and the food tasted fine and didn't make me sick, but you owe it to yourself to read how terrible they are with handling food before ever going back. They've definitely lost my business."}
{"text":"I wanted put zero but yelp does not allow.Worst place ever...the owner is rude an thinks that he owns the world....we went in once there...the waiter made us sit and wait only to be told that they don't serve what we wanted...and the to top it all the owner says he didnt have time...seriously I don't know how the food was but in no case can the owner be rude....would never advise anyone to go here... Worst place"}
{"text":"This place used to be a favorite but the quality continues to deteriorate.  It appears there are new owners.    The buffet items are overly greasy and spiced oddly.  Last time I was in not one staff person there even said a word to us.  It was weird!"}
{"text":"When I lived in Bloomfield, I came here once a week for almost 2 years. One of my all-time favorite Indian restaurants ever. The food is consistently delicious, the Chicken Tika Masala is one of the best I've ever had, and it's comfortable and quiet when you dine in. Not too spicy unless you request it that way. (I usually ask for an '8' which is perfect, but not as hot as it sounds) Take out orders are huge portions, which is an added bonus if you asked me. Service is very friendly and on top of everything else the prices are very reasonable. I would go out of my way to stop in Pittsburgh to eat here again anytime."}
{"text":"Cozy and dim lighting. Food is okay - large quantities for take-out, watch out!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night.  It had been awhile since I'd ventured over to Taste of India, and I believe the last couple of times I had the lunch buffet.   Dinner was thoroughly great. Their chutneys are fresh (seem to be housemade) and flavorful.    I had the lamb madras- chunks of lamb in a rich sauce redolent of ginger, curry and coconut.  It was really tasty.  The lamb was a bit tougher than I expected, but still good.  I appreciated the server's suggestion that I order it a notch spicier than usual, as otherwise the sweetness of tamarind overwhelms the other flavors.  We split the spinach naan- very plentiful basket for $2.95.  My boyfriend has a standard order nearly every time we eat Indian food; he loves the Tandoori mixed grill.  Although Taste of India serves theirs with raita, and not masala curry sauce as other establishments in Madison do, he proclaimed theirs the best he's had in Madison.  A steaming mound of tandoori chicken, fish, shrimp, and seekh kabob atop surprisingly flavorful red/green bell peppers and onions- even with a little help from me, we took over half of it home.  At $15.95, that's a steal.  The fish was something one doesn't see nearly enough of on the tandoori mixed grill, and it was a standout.  Well worth the trek from east side to west, right down to clean and festive decor and little touches like silver chutney spoons and antique tureens containing my curry.  mmmm."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place to eat and the best Indian in the burgh.  My family has been obsessed  for 13 years now and would make the trek to Lawrenceville before it got all hipster-chic to be there anyway.  Now, as soon as I get home, I can't wait to get some spicy lamb curry and their paneer makhni.  I suggest ordering a few different dishes, and defintely some meat or veggie somosas.  and the sweet nan.  OH MAN, it's all so good.    Just don't order the wine...blechh (I only made that mistake once.)"}
{"text":"This spot is pretty amazing. I've eaten some really good Indian in NYC. And tried pretty much every restaurant in Pittsburgh. There's something different about the way they spice things here. It's damn good. I ordered a feast tonight as I always when trying a new place to try as much as possible.  Chicken jal frezi, stellar. It's not available at a lot of places. Though kadai is similar. Sag paneer, amazing. Haven't tasted anything like it here. Good heat, a subtle sweetness, good paneer too. Lamb curry, too expensive at $15. Tasty af though. Chicken soup, basic, but really good. Garlic nan, hard to mess up.  Even the raita was perfect.  Oh, the portions are much bigger than any other place around. One entree will feed 3 normal people. 2 hungry people. And 1 fat kid. ;)"}
{"text":"Don't go! On a scale of 1 to 10, I would give the food a 3, service 3 and ambiance 5. Prices are high and serving size small.   The tandoori chicken is the worst I have eaten in AZ. For a moment there I was envying my dog's chew stick. Really, it sucked.  Wonder how they survive."}
{"text":"I'm not a cheapskate nor a fan of buffets, but when it comes to Taste of India, I must say the lunch buffet is one of the best values I've seen in Calgary.   The quality of the food was excellent, especially the quality of the meat. Often times you don't recognize the textures of meats in Indian buffets, but they had chicken breasts for the chicken, super lean goat and amazing eggplant. They make the nan fresh on request and asked us if there was anything not on the buffet we wanted to see. They keep small quantities on the buffet to ensure the food is fresh.  When I picked up a takeout menu, I noticed their entree prices to be reasonable. Based on the other reviews, this will be my new Indian takeout place for Calgary."}
{"text":"When a restaurant decides to name itself something as uncreative as \"Taste of India\", you pretty much know that its food is going to reflect it. I'm not saying that ToI's food is awful. It's just that it's there and not remotely remarkable.   I can only comment its lunch buffets, which I've had on a number of occasions. Nothing too creative offered - somewhat bland grilled tandoori chicken, chicken tikka masala, palak paneer, navratan korma, yada yada yada. The naan that comes in the basket is unremarkable, and obviously not fresh from a tandoor, but whatever, you get what you pay for during lunch buffet time anyway. Most Indians I know here in Phoenix also give a collective, middle of the road \"eh\" expression when Taste of India is mentioned as a possible dining choice. Note that they didn't scowl nor did they jump at the suggestion and yell, \"Let's go there NOW!\"  So take it for what you will about Taste of India - not bad food, not great food, but Indian food that'll fill you up and be forgotten about in a day or so."}
{"text":"Relatively new, this is a great spot for Indian. It was empty when we walked in around 7pm on a Wednesday evening. Please don't let this scare you away.! The Cook used to work over at Taj Palace but recently started here. I ordered the chicken tikka masala, it was creamy tomato based and extremely delicious.  Chili Paneer was great. We also had flakey vegetables samosa and garlic naan. I will be making this my go to spot for Indian. Bye bye Taj Palace."}
{"text":"Came here for the lunch buffet at 2:00 pm, the buffet runs until 4. The items in the buffet were well stocked, but lukewarm, which really took away from the enjoyment of the food. The butter chicken is what I usually go to first and the dish here was a 3/5. The most enjoyable was a goat curry - perfectly seasoned and marinated. Reasonable choices (~6 curries) but no desserts. There was maybe two other tables in the restaurant at the time I went, the rest of the place was empty which made the service inexcusable. The server checked on me once very briefly at the beginning to offer me naan and I never saw her again. I had to flag her down just to get a soft drink. Overall not the best experience given the positive reviews I read. Might give the buffet one more try at an earlier time given the reasonable price ($14.99) but won't be in any rush."}
{"text":"Got the Chicken Tikka recently. It was good but for the price you don't get much chicken. I ended up with a lot of rice and sauce left over. The sauce was good, the rice was fragrant which isn't really my thing but did taste alright. I also got the garlic naan bread. That was pretty good as well. Over all it was decent food but a bit over priced in my opinion."}
{"text":"Wow!  Tried this place today.  Excellent food.  Good variety from both North and South India.  All of your usual Indian favorites, plus some dishes I had never tried before.  Price is great.  I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"The food here was delicious! Love the korma and the mango lassi. Staff was very friendly. We enjoyed ourselves very much."}
{"text":"Just got back from trying the lunch buffet at Taste of India, which was pretty good and a definite value.  It is $7.95/person and includes a drink - soda, mango juice or mango lassi.  The buffet has the usual chutneys and raitas, naan, vegetable pakoras, fresh fruit (mostly watermelon), salad, chicken fried rice and plain basmati rice, 3 chicken dishes and 3 veggie dishes.  Today there was tandoori chicken, chicken tikka masala and a plain old chicken curry, channa masala, alu palak, and alu green beans.  There were also gulab jamuns.  My favorite was definitely the alu green beans, which disappointingly is not on the menu.  The chickpeas were good, but I thought the alu palak was disappointing.  (I am generally disappointed in palak paneer at restaurants since I have an awesome recipe that I make at home all the time.)  The watermelon chunks were an awesome palate cleanser, and the gulab jamuns were great.  Total for two people came to $17 before tip.  This is a nice little place, and at lunch almost everyone there is Children's Hospital staff.  Parking is a little hard to find since the residential streets are permit only.  But I really like this place and it's definitely worth it."}
{"text":"If you love Indian food, you want to try this place. Ok, not sure of how yelp is figuring out recommended reviews since there are lots of good reviews of this place but not in the recommended ones which is what most people read.  When trying a new Indian restaurant (before I get to taste the food which really makes the quality decision), it is a real plus to see Indian customers. I have often seen tables of them here eating which implies to the authenticity of the food.  I love Indian food, my go to style (along with Thai) while traveling & in the many cities we've lived in. We were going to 2 of the Flamingo restaurants often, until we found this place. I've only checked in 14 times, but have been there more, just sometimes too much in a rush to start savoring some goodies that I forget to grab the phone & checkin.  Usually we come to the lunch buffet - with our appetites it's definitely the most cost effective time. Being vegan & gluten-free there are still enough choices for me to fill my plate 3 (or more) times.  For those that like their food spicy or made to order, this is where they shine. Knowing I like spicy, when I ordered the aloo gobi the best explanation was \"total mouth orgasm\". It was so amazingly perfectly spiced. I was actually annoyed when he took a bite & also liked it so much that the \"wow that's really good\" was followed by stealing more bites. I wanted to take more home than the little bit of sauce that was left. But even that sauce which did come home cuz there was no way I was wasting it, made another awesome dish when baked with some green beans.  So obviously I recommend this dish - tell them your spiciness happy point is.  Also if you like your uttapam crispy like I do, let them know. They are willing to make the dishes to your preferences (unlike a certain Encino Calif restaurant I won't name here).  I was told that there are more South Indian dishes available on weekends in addition to what is on the menu.  Which means I really need to try & work a weekend visit in so I can try new dishes since I love to try new tastes - if I can force myself not to order the aloo gobi every non-buffet visit. Granted it is sometimes on the buffet, but since few people enjoy my preferred spice level, it would be more tame.  Ok, this review is ending now because I am obsessing about a dish I now crave but can't get to tonight. Of course I could call them for delivery....."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here as it was only a few blocks from our Bed + Breakfast, and easy to get a table. The food was good, but not outstanding. The service was solid and yes, the ambiance was okay (for being in a miniature strip mall/plaza). The restaurant has a cozy feel to it.  We had... two samosa, matar paneer and aloo chana, along with a roti. Nothing stood out as excellent, though the peas + cheese definitely had a leg up on the potatoes + chick peas. The samosa were a bit chewy, but not bad.   We ordered our food \"Medium\" spice, and it was pretty hot. I feel like it's always a crap shoot in places like this - are they compensating for me already, or are they talking Hot is the real deal, Indian Hot? We typically choose \"Medium\" and hope - in this case, it was borderline too spicy. We enjoyed the food, but it was close - if we return, we'll probably go with mild.  The portions were plenty large enough, as is the case with most Indian restaurants.  Overall, the food was fine, the service was great, and we had a nice time. When we return to Madison for our next visit, though, we'll probably try some different places."}
{"text":"Living in Northwest Calgary, you learn to keep your expectations low because most of the restaurants up here stink.  Thankfully Taste of India did not need this \"help\"!    After a week of turkey dinner overload, I was ready for something totally different.....Indian food.  Bring on the curry and the naan!  After noticing a sign for Taste of India, I thought it would be the perfect time to try it.  Their sign said take out or dine in so we stopped to get a menu.  We were happy to see that they also have delivery (though there is a charge depending on distance...it was $5 for us).  There menu is quite extensive including a huge selection of Indian sweets and a Haka menu.    We decided to try Butter Chicken, Okra Masala, Garlic Chili Prawns (from the Haka menu), steamed rice & plain naan.  The butter chicken was some of the best we've ever had.  The sauce was excellent with nice spice.  The Garlic Chili prawns was a kind of small serving & the prawns were deep fried (which is not mentioned in the menu) but overall the dish was very tasty.  Spicy and complex it was one of my favorite dishes though I totally think they could do it without deep frying the shrimp.  The okra masala was very good with small, young okra.  The only negatives with the meal were that the naan was cold on arrival and they forgot our raita.  I called & they said they would give us our next order of raita free which is fine with us.   Overall this is a great addition to the delivery situation in our area.  Yay!"}
{"text":"Today I want back to this Resturant for lunch. It is back to great quality food with good variety even fish. This is under new ownership and management. Worth trying. Great taste. I will be back there with clients for sure."}
{"text":"This has been my new go to spot every Wednesday after didactics with a few close colleagues. We typically have our lectures at Presbyterian hospital and look forward to coming here for a quick hot meal. The food is buffet style and offers all the classic fare, including my favorite saag paneer.  Their dessert is pretty tasty too! The rice pudding is a little too sweet for my liking but the mango pudding with chunks of peaches hits the spot.  The staff is super friendly as well and always provide my friends and I a warm welcome when we arrive.  We are all done with our meal as quickly as 20 min, but often stay longer for the company! Highly recommend this spot for lunch, especially if you're working at Presbyterian hospital!"}
{"text":"Went here Friday night. It's a fairly small place, with seating for maybe about 30ish people, and I'd say they were about half full. So, no wait for a table, and we had quick and attentive service.   We ordered the samosas, goat curry, spinach paneer (both at \"medium\" spiciness), regular naan, and garlic naan (along with a couple of Kingfisher beers). The spinach paneer was really excellent: creamy, thick, and with just the right amount of heat and seasoning. The samosas were pretty standard, though especially good because of how right-out-of-the-fryer crispy they were. The naan was just fine. The goat curry was the only disappointment, with not nearly as much meat as I would have liked/expected, especially at around $13. Next time I might stick to veggie options."}
{"text":"Our go-to Indian place for dine-in or take-out. Lots of tasty food & attentive staff."}
{"text":"Food, customer service, ambience - all were super good. Food was served very quickly. Will definitely come back here when I come to Pittsburg again and will also recommend this place to my friends."}
{"text":"This is my wife an my go to Indian joint.  We eat there twice a month.  We love the Veg. and Non-Veg. dinners for two, but be sure to sub out the chicken pakora for the veg. pakora.  My wife and I like spicy Indian, so this place is great for us. They also have a decent AYCE lunch buffet. The only problem is that we usually end up fighting over who gets the last of the Tikka Masla."}
{"text":"Great space, and convenient to where we live. Food is on point. We missed out on the buffet. But, either way. The food is great."}
{"text":"Located in the Creekside plaza in the NW community of Kincora/Evanston.  Went with a  friend to try there lunch buffet during the week. I am not a big fan of buffets however since it was Indian food, I was persuaded :)   They have allot of variety and all items were warm/hot. They have vast selection of vegetarian items, which is amazing.  The naan bread was so good that I would have been happy with just that.  The place was busy however since it was lunch time and most likely prime buffet time it's to be expected. Service was good, when we did require it for beverages. Pricing for lunch was reasonable ($15 per person) and I believe the buffet is on till 4:00pm during the week.   Good food and service. Will be back again to see what the restaurant is like when ordering from the menu."}
{"text":"I have been there a couple of times for lunch buffet. The waiter was friendly. The buffet has delicious curry dishes, but I wish they could offer more variety of dishes. Anyway, it's a good place to go when I crave Indian food once in awhile."}
{"text":"I don't give 5 stars but I will say this almost got it today. This is the second time I have been here and today I was blown away. Everything I ate was amazing. There was things missing but wow I'm too full to get anymore in. This place has ambiance and everything. Definitely in my top 3 Indian restaurants in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Amazing food! The place looks ok! But the food was awesome. Homemade feel. Service was excellent as well. From now on when I visit Vegas I'll have to plan a meal here."}
{"text":"Ehh. Probably won't be back. Had the buffet today. Seemed like they don't get busy & the food had been sitting out awhile. The rice was... Hard. The food was pretty bland. Was expecting more flavor since it is Indian food.  I'd say the only good thing about this restaurant is the fresh naan."}
{"text":"I asked the waitress what she recommended. She said they were all good and it's hard to make a decision. I was going to be the judge of that, and she was indeed telling the truth. So good!"}
{"text":"It's nice to know that there's decent Indian food that isn't far out in the boonies like Udipi (which, btw, is worth the trip).  I can't say I thought the restaurant aesthetics were that fantastic.  The acoustics in there are horrible, and it seems kind of dark.  But the service was nice, and the food is great.  Beware the stairs of death when you go to the bathroom.  I haven't seen Chicken Muglai in years (they call it Muglai Korma on the menu) and the version they have is excellent.  We also had the sag paneer and a number of other dishes I can't even remember.  All I can recall is that I got my chicken muglai and it was GOOD.  The rest was good too.  I should also note that the portions are pretty large by Indian restaurant standards.  One dish goes a LONG way.  The nan is a little eh.  A little overcooked, in my estimation.  The garlic nan had lots of garlic on it but little garlic taste.  So, you get all the downside without any of the upside.  Too bad.  In any case, I will most definitely be coming back.  I"}
{"text":"I don't have a ton of experience with Indian cuisine, but I loved everything served here. The outside is a bit unassuming, every time I go by their curtains are drawn so it's hard to get a feel for the business. However, once you come inside you'll find that it's warm and inviting.  The food is amazing and aromatic, how I think Indian food should be. I opted for their lamb tandoori, intentionally deviated from the too familiar curry. It came out on a sizzling cast-iron skillet and was full of flavor. The vegetables were nice and crunchy and the lamb had a bright red color that looked beautiful.  The service was impeccable and attentive. I especially loved the breath freshener at the end of a meal; your bill comes with a whole handful of fennel, annis and huge salt crystals to freshen your breath. It's a little touch but a great way to seal the deal on an already great experience.  Check out my full review: http://eatinginpittsburgh.com/2010/08/30/unassuming-indian-a-taste-of-india/"}
{"text":"Went in for Indian food and found out that they were only serving a limited Mexican menu! very disappointing!"}
{"text":"Solid Indian food in Madison which is tough to come by  Portions are a little small for the price in regards to the dinner menu"}
{"text":"I got with the tandoori dinner. 18$ for a full meal from appetizer to a nice small desert. Level 7 of spice, it was spicy but if you enjoy extra spicy kick it to a 10. The tandoori dinner was perfect size including the lamb saag I got as my 2nd meat pick. I also got king fisher Indian beer. A Good lager. It was a cold Monday night so I ended up eating my meal and chatting with the guy working the front of the house. It was rather nice since I went alone.  In the end good service and a relaxing meal with a nice hot cup of tea at the end.  It was all very good but I have had better lamb saag in the past."}
{"text":"I was so very pleased with Taste of India, the service was friendly and very helpful. They assisted us in picking out our meals since we didn't know what to order but wanted to try out Indian food.  The price is very reasonable and the food was full of flavor and just mouth watering.  I am looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I've had Indian Cuisine this amazing! Kudos! So friendly!!"}
{"text":"I would have given negative stars if I could have , worst indian food I have ever eaten in USA . Under cooked chicken , under cooked rice ....... Baffled ."}
{"text":"This restaurant is fantastic. I just moved to Madison, having recently lived in New York, and was relieved to find not only a superb Indian food option, but in fact one of the best (if not the best??) Indian restaurants I've been to anywhere. I'll probably be heading in at least a couple times a month!"}
{"text":"I should preface this by saying we have never eaten in here, only take out and delivery.  The first time we got food from Taste of India was because it was convenient and quick. The second time was because it was so good the first time! Their butter chicken is realy good, and their naan is HUGE. We've had some of the other dishes as well, but we keep coming back to the butter chicken.  Their delivery was pretty quick, although the delivery driver did get lost and had to call for directions. When we did take-out the order was ready in less than 20 minutes."}
{"text":"SUPER delicious! Tried the dinner for 2 and we couldn't finish it... so much food for a great price!"}
{"text":"Loved the buffet. Naan was soft, which I love. Food wasn't  to spicy. Lots of variety. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I can't express enough to you everyone the level of flavor this restaurant offers in their cuisine. I'm an Indian food fanatic, and I THOUGHT I've had the best until I visited here on May 11th 2016. My friend and I shared Samosa Chat as an appetizer and the first thing I noticed was the incredible texture of the pastry of the Samosas. Then, the flavor exploded on our taste buds. This was my friends first time ever trying Indian cuisine and she was blown away!  She couldn't believe what she was missing all the times I tried to tell her how wonderful this cuisine is. I suggested she order Navratan Korma since she has changed to a vegetarian diet. It was better than any I have ever had anywhere. Same thing for my chicken Tikka Masala. It was creamy, loaded with flavor!  Treat yourselves to the,best Indian food you'll ever experience!"}
{"text":"Worst ever. Came here for lunch and waited for an hour and wasted my lunch time. And communication is not working out. Happened to be no buffet today and everything is charged separately. No dish comes with rice or naan. And small amount of rice is $4! And we were running out of time before even the food arrive so asked them to give us to-go boxes. They said we should stay and eat. What???? Had to ask for boxes 2 more times. Not coming back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place several times, thinking it would get better - it doesn't!   Went again last week for the Sunday buffet when you think they would try harder perhaps...NOPE again.  VERY few items on buffet, all extremely watered down and tasteless.  Only chicken dish was a watery cream sauce with obviously left-over tandoori chicken from 'whenever'...COMPLETE WITH ALL THE BONES!   We couldn't believe it.    Don't even think about going here - go on down Bell Rd a little ways (West) to about 29th Ave. and Bell - India Palace in the shopping center on South side - excellent.   PS - Mgr. at Taste of India always rude, too."}
{"text":"I just went here for a quick dinner before work with my lovely woman, whom I adore very much.  I had the aloo gobi and she had the bhindi masala.  Aloo Gobi is a vegetarian dish with potatoes, cauliflower and spices.  The cauliflower must have been marinated in something because it was full of wonderful flavor, moist and tender.  One of the best aloo gobi's I have had and I have had quite a few.  The bhindi masala also had wonderful flavors and the okra was the star of the show in this dish.  The spices melded together nicely and were not too overpowering.  We had the vegetable platter for an appetizer and it was some of the best samosa and pakora I have tasted.  Some of these fried dishes can come out too crunchy, but these were soft as silk and melted in our mouths.  Again, the flavors were just amazing.  The really great thing is that not one of the ingredients stood out too much, so as to you leave you guessing what all was there.  This added some mystery to it that was quite lovely.  The service tonight was good except for one small item.  I needed to rush off to get to work and I kept asking the server for the bill.  He would not come out with it.  Then finally a lady brought it out.  Maybe, this lady was in charge of the bills and did not give him the authority to write bills up?  I have no idea what was going on there, but everything else was really excellent.  They must have remodeled the place because the interior looks completely new.  This one might be a new favorite for me, but it will have to survive a second, or third round at the least.   P.S. - Something to keep in mind is that occasionally they flub minor things on your order.  Iike for instance I ordered a coffee and what came out was tea.  There must be small gaps in communication in the kitchen, but just notify the server and they will clear it up."}
{"text":"Lesson learned: don't trust yelp with south Asian food. Went there looking at the review, was excited, only to be disappointed with the food and the service.  Tried paneer jalferzi n seikh kebab. Both were dry and lacked flavor. Even the garlic roti we ordered tasted raw. We are not the sort of people who waste food, but for the first time I didn't take the leftovers home. Please try another place. Definitely not authentic Indian."}
{"text":"REALLY wanted to love this place in our soon to be new neighbourhood. We had been talking about going for some time and I am so disappointed to have been let down! We walked in and were seated fairly quickly. The table I thought was dirty but it was the table UNDER the glass that was filthy and I also noted that there was food splattered all over our booth chairs. The place smelled great though and I thought, just a quick meal, it will be fine. I even drank water tonight to keep things simple. Service was spotty at best. We were a long time sitting without ordering.  To start we were brought some crunchy chick pea chips 'on the house'. Very thoughtful but tasteless.  Our order consisted of curry chicken and I wanted something very hot and spicy so the server told me I should get the vindaloo. He also told me that the shrimp dish I was looking at consisted of very small shrimp and the prawn order which was more expensive had bigger shrimp. I asked if they were fresh or frozen and he told me FRESH so I ordered the prawn vindaloo. We ordered jasmine rice on the side as well as Naan bread. Let me tell you, the Naan bread kept me from going out hungry. It was sooo good and warm, buttery. The rice was cold and the beeping of the microwave in the kitchen did not give me confidence about how the rice had once been heated or any of our other food for that matter. The chicken curry had a nice flavour to it and the chicken was well prepared. Hubby had ordered it mild but it came out spicier than my vindaloo and I had specifically asked for mine to be so hot it burned my mouth. Sigh....  I would not get the vindaloo again and I am warning you all that the shrimp did not taste fresh and were so grossly overcooked I had to tell the server, politely of course. They were like flavourless rubber. He advised me that he would tell the chef and that next time he would tell him to make them \"softer\" for me... Oh boy.  I did not really get a Taste of India tonight. If you are going to order from here, stick to the chicken dishes and get it to go. Huge menu, small portions."}
{"text":"Let me explain to you something. I didn't know, until I moved 12 hours away from here, what a magical place Taste of India really is. I also didn't know, that when I fly into Pittsburgh, I would directly be driving from the airport to pick up take out before seeing my family. Helllooo! Here is your daughter you haven't seen in over a year, she comes reeking of curries and spices every-single-time!   Can we start with the fact that the service here is spectacular?! My friends and I have been coming here for years. The owners are cute and funny and we are terrors when we are there because we bring large parties and we are so excited to order an entire table of plates.  What fills our table?   Booze, yes, they have beer.  Bread: Chapatti (Yummy Whole Wheat Goodness!)  Veggie Options: Paneer Jalferji (Cheese and Veg) Dal Sag (Lentils) Paneer Makhni (Cheese and Peas) Chana Masala (Duh) *Personal Fav: Malia Kofta (These little fried vegetable balls with creamy tomato sauce and almonds!) --Haven't found this one anywhere else as good as theirs! Ah! I am drooling thinking of it.   What do they do to this freaking food? I just don't know. Go soon! Ask for spice level of 7-8 if you want to tantalize your taste-buds with some fiery food and if you would like to ship me a container of the Malia Kofta I will be more than happy to message you my address.....   Oh, and my favorite date in Pittsburgh? Taste of India and dancing at Brillo Box. So iconic. So Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Worset take out ever. Veg Manchrian with NO Gravy (never seen anything like this before)! Bland Paneer Pakoras (no salt, stale  paneer). Never going there again."}
{"text":"Pathetic way of treating customers! As if they are doing a favor letting people come to their restaurant!"}
{"text":"Monroe Street was busy today and all of the restaurants were packed for lunch. Bluphie's is pretty mediocre, so we decided to try Taste of India.   We had the lunch buffet, which offered typical Indian dishes. It had everything I wanted and expected, and it all tasted good.   The service was very good too. Waters were refilled quickly and my coffee cup was refilled multiple times without even asking for refills! Staff members weren't too chatty, but when paying our bill they were very kind.  The restaurant was clean and nicely decorated.   It's a solid bet if you are in the mood for Indian food."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I really enjoy Indian food. I've tried places throughout New York and all over Vegas and I cook a wide variety of North and South dishes at home. With Taste of India being open for 3 months now, I wanted to have high expectations for this place. It does seem like a \"hole-in-the-wall\" place given the semi-bad area but anyway, let me start.  My group and I walked in for the Indian Buffet. The place had no customers so we were the only ones. The place looked completely empty and had a rather \"cold\" feeling with little to no decor. We sat down and a couple minutes later were given water with no ice.  We were asked what kind of naan bread we wanted then we got up over to the buffet line. While perusing the buffet line, the food didn't really look that appetizing. I got a plate full of few things like jeera rice, chicken tikka masala, saag paneer, and mutton korma.   Within two minutes of eating, I quickly began to lose my appetite and here's why. The rice was extremely overcooked and possibly not made that day. It was very clumpy and soggy and had little to no flavor. Ten minutes later we received our naan (which was undercooked and very doughy) and I began dipping it into the Chicken Tikka Masala. The masala tasted like Campbell's tomato soup (I kid you not). I couldn't eat another bite of it. Everything on my plate was under temperature so my group and I started to worry whether or not we would get sick. Anything from 42-140 degree F is a temperature danger zone. Nothing was hot and the paneer cheese was very cold once bitten into. The tandoori chicken looked \"sad\" sitting there and had no flavor and reminded me of the chicken thighs I used to eat for those horrible school lunches in elementary school. There is nothing genuine about this place and frankly, it's rather sad. I don't know about you but everything about this place needs help. From the lack of decor to the most important part--the food, there is nothing welcoming about this place, it's not traditional, and it's very empty. I honestly felt like I was in that buffet scene in Vegas Vacation.  Indian food is supposed to be fresh and screaming with flavor and I do not know what this place is trying to do. I left with cramping in my stomach and felt horrible for most of the day after this. Maybe it was the combination of the food, or the temp of the food, but it is now not worth going back.   Another bad part of this experience was we learned that they delivered.  We saw the guy with take-out containers loading them with food from the buffet line. He kept on looking over at our group. Not sure if he didn't want us to see what he was doing? Someone from my group asked if it was for delivery and he said it's for his \"friends.\" Uhhh, what?    Please consider this review. I highly do not recommend coming here."}
{"text":"I might have just found my favorite Indian place. I went with two friends for a feast and we were not disappointed! We were greeted warmly and told we could sit anywhere.  The space is a little small, but that actually adds to the atmosphere of warm, delicious Indian food, friendly owners and staff, and good friends!  I ordered the Malia Kofta for my entree.  These are vegetable balls with raisins and and almonds in a creamy sauce.  It was out of this world!!!  The veggie balls were slightly crispy on the edges but soft in the middle and packed full of flavor.  The sauce was not too creamy and the raisins added a sweet taste throughout.  Both of my friends have since gone back and ordered this!  I wish I could remember what they ate, but this actually happened a few months ago.  I remember the Malia Kofta like it was yesterday, though!"}
{"text":"I went in late on a Saturday night and there wasn't anyone else in there for the entirety of our meal. Besides being a little too quiet for my liking, the food was fantastic and the staff were super pleasant. The chutney that comes with the meals is tasty. The last time I ordered from there it was take out during prime time on a Friday night. The place was hopping. I will definitely have to come back to check out the buffet."}
{"text":"Good lunch Buffet. I think it might have been better when it opened as we are at 3 pm.  Wait staff was bored.  I would go back earlier. I ate dinner here and it was truly terrific!"}
{"text":"Love this place. We always have a good meal here. The food is always really hot and fresh. We always order samosas, mutter paneer, korma, chicken tikka masala, Chana masala. Like I said never disappoints. We also really like the chutneys they serve. The staff is always very friendly and never makes us feel awkward about being there during the last hour they are open if we grab a late dinner. They are also so good about keeping your water filled.  Definitely order off of the menu for the best food. Buffet can be hit or miss."}
{"text":"I've have enjoyed Indian cuisine for many years. This place is the best. While the buffet here is smaller than most, the quality of food is absolutely second to none. I can't say enough good things about this place. If you like Indian food like I do, you must come eat here. The tandoori chicken is perfect as well as everything they choose to serve you. No way will you be disappointed"}
{"text":"2 for awesome service & the best naan ... The rest.. Hands down to a zero ... & I feel bad rating it so low... But I've had wonderful Indian food... Outside of the mother land...& this is just horrible... :-("}
{"text":"Food was awesome. Service was quick and atmosphere was enjoyable n pleasant. I would recommend this place for Indian authentic food lovers."}
{"text":"Ordered for pick-up on a friday night. Pretty standard menu (not exceptionally large but not tiny, either) with typical indian fare. Ordering on grubhub gives you the option of mild, medium or spicy for each entree you add to your basket. One in my party went mild and it wasn't bland or unflavorful - they had dialed everything back without losing the heart of the dish (and a little heat remained to give it a little kick). I requested medium and the heat in mine was definitely amped up. If you want spicy, request spicy. I imagine this goes for sit-down dining as well, although I can't speak to that specifically.  The food was promptly prepared, the host I interacted with was pleasant, professional, and very prompt, and by the time I got home everything was still very warm. Very satisfied. Only major mark is the price: for naan, two entrees, and extra rice we managed to rack up a bill of over 40$. You can find cheaper options elsewhere."}
{"text":"New favorite Indian restaurant in Madison. I can't believe it took me almost 7 years to check this gem out! The lunch buffet was absolutely outstanding and included multiple flavorful dishes included a goat and lamb dish and several vegetarian and chicken dished. I'd venture to say one of the best lunch buffets I've had! The price was right as well for only $10 ($9 if you pay cash) for the weekend buffet. I will definitely be visiting this place again soon for lunch or checking out the dinner menu!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, good price and nice people! The vegetarian dish with eggplant and potato is my favorite. The only thing I dislike was their naan bread."}
{"text":"I stopped by the restaurant a few Saturdays ago for a quick buffet lunch.  The place is generally dark with tables, not booths.  The place is clean, but the mood is chaotic; papers on some tables, chairs stacked, boxes around, etc.  It is difficult to have a relaxing lunch when the atmosphere is simply distracting.  I said about four words to the waiter (literally two thank yous for the water refill).  The food is basic Indian and is good, not great - tandoori chicken, palak pannear, etc.  I was hoping for something unique, or at least a signature dish, but my hope was not realized.  The price of the buffett is under $10.00.  It is worth it, but I do not have a strong desire to return any time soon."}
{"text":"I love Taste of India. Maybe I am biased because it is in walking distance from my apartment. In my mind, the food holds up with some of the better Indian restaurants in DC. I mostly get paneer or chickpea dishes and they've all been solid. Good atmosphere, service, etc. If you just want solid Indian go here. Simply put."}
{"text":"Yum. Great Indian food on Monroe st.  My pick up experience was quick and easy. I called in my order outside and my food was ready in about ten minutes. Being somewhat of a rice freak, I asked for an extra portion after I realized they only provided a small togo package of rice. They were nice and gracious enough to provide extra rice at no additional charge.  My roasted eggplant dish was delicious with the right amount of heat. The naan was very soft and tasty. I had enough for dinner and saved leftovers for lunch the next day. I suspect that I might be picking up dinner here more than once, while I am in Madison.  Most definitely a fan!"}
{"text":"I have been to Taste of India several times, and every time they have never disappointed me. The service is great and the food is amazing. We were seated promptly, orders were taken, water replenished as soon as I was close to being empty and food came out right away. The food are delicious, proportioned and well priced. I always have the chicken tikka masala and butter chicken. I also had their garlic naan, beef and lamb curry. So if you're in the mood for some good Indian cuisine, Taste of India is a great choice."}
{"text":"I don't know why people had issues with Taste of India at CMU (they have an area in CMU open during lunch and dinner hours) ... because I really liked their food.  In fact, this restaurant was what caused me to start liking Indian food in the first place :)  From this place, I am absolutely in love with their Palak Paneer and Saag dishes (basically, all the green creamy spinach dishes) because there's so much flavor in them and there's not chunks of raw spinach in them like you see in other Indian places.  Their Matar Paneer is also fantastic, and their vegetable dishes (those that have potatoes, cauliflower, etc.) are also very good.  The Naan is not bad either when you get it fresh because it's fluffy and has some oil on it for flavor, but if it's not fresh, I'd definitely pass on it because it gets all dry.  The oily noodles they have are also very good, especially when it's a fresh batch.  However, I'm not a fan of the Chicken curry dishes because to me, it's just orange + chicken...   I'm going to miss this place after I leave CMU! No joke."}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying the food tastes absolutely magnificent! (mild to medium hot). I was a little curious about the butter chicken because of the previous reviews, well it tastes great!   But my ultimate favourite (I even grabbed a bunch to take out) was the Mango Chutney. It's like a dessert they have and oh my God there are no words to express how good it is.   The service is also great and the lunch buffet is at the awesome price of 12.99$"}
{"text":"Food from the motherland is a weakness of mine so despite good feedback from some friends, I tried to resist coming here when I first moved to Lawrenceville. So much for that!  Taste of India is flat out great. Prices are reasonable. The atmosphere is simple and tastefully done (unlike another restaurant in Oakland, cough cough).  The staff are courteous and accommodating. I called out for take-out one night and when I walked up to the restaurant, I found that they had mixed up my order and I'd have to wait a few more minutes. As an apology for waiting, they threw in free samosas! (btw, the samosas here are delicious). Rest assured, this isn't a regular occurrence; the next time I ordered from here, the order was promptly ready.  The tandoori is very good. The chicken tikka masala is nice and creamy with good flavor. The palak paneer is also delicious. My taste buds are very happy to have found good Indian take-out within the city limits. (My waist-line is NOT pleased)."}
{"text":"Very yummy, great customer service, very clean!   I love buttered chicken, and chicken curry, but my favorite is dal makhani, with garlic naan. Totally recommend for lunch (the buffet to try out a variety of meals) to sit in, and eat, or to go. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best Indian food that I have had in a loooong time. I am frequent traveller to Las Vegas and have been craving for good South Indian food. My colleague at my office had mentioned a couple of times about this restaraunt. I finally got a chance to go there today for a lunch buffet. The food was fantastic. The chicken briyani, goat curry and the chicken masala were top notch. The \"Idly Sambar\", a specific variety of sambar made just for Idly and Dosas was phenomenal. The owner later told us that she is planning to have few more special items coming which includes \"Appam\" which is one of my favs.   Can't wait to go back for dinner!"}
{"text":"The food was ok at best.   Too much salt added to all the dishes we had.  I really liked the vegetable samosa.  The saag paneer was ok, but the matar paneer was horrible.  the chicken masala was ok as well.  The portions were pretty small for the price you pay.   The restaurant was big, service was slow, and it wasn't that busy either.  I don't expect to eating here again."}
{"text":"This is your usual run of the mill indian lunch buffet place.  They have all the usuals  at this northern/central style indian restaurant.  For Phoenix, it is a three star venue.  There are better and there are worse.  This one is pretty average.  I never dropped in for dinner, but the indian coworkers didn't come here.  This was usually all white people.  There's nothing wrong with that.  Eat what you like, but know the score."}
{"text":"This place serves wonderful food in the typically simple interior of most Indian restaurants. All parts of the restaurant are very clean and well kept. They do serve beer and wine, including the large format Indian beers. One thing that really sets this place apart is how the staff is always friendly. We thought it was a byob place on our first visit, and the owner was more than happy to open our drinks, smiled and asked us to please enjoy our drinks with the dinner. The service has been similar on every visit. Excellent overall."}
{"text":"I had the lunch buffet here.  It was very good, and reasonably priced ($9 for all-you-can-eat).  The bread was outstanding.  Some of the hot food was a little on the heavy side...too buttery for me.  The spices were good...the dishes were strongly seasoned but with some subtlety and complexity.  None of the food here was even remotely spicy (in a hot pepper sense) though.  Why five stars?  More hot-spicy = good.  And less heavy on the dishes.  I also was less-than-impressed by an eggplant dish and a few other dishes that were a little on the bland side.  But overall, the food here was great.  And the bread was REALLY good.  Desserts were also very good--very flavorful and spiced just right!"}
{"text":"Great price on a lunch buffet at $9.99. I've come here many times with friends as it is close to home and never busy. Lots of authentic dishes in the a la carte menu, but limited selection in the buffet. Fresh naan is brought out during the lunch Buffett, soo delicious. Great ambience as the restaurant is decorated in Indian art and murals, also a good mix of Indian music and western music playing.  I would definitely go back and I do recommend to anyone in the area!"}
{"text":"I ordered a takeout from here for the first time. While the delivery timing and ordering was seamless, I didn't think that the food was authentic. I ordered biriyani, lamb curry and naan. The naan was good but the other two dishes were disappointing. I can never understand why most Indian restaurants in this town can't get their biriyani right. Cilantro & spring onions do not belong in biriyani, as it did in their dish. And the curry item was just very ordinary and watery."}
{"text":"Love Indian delivery from here!! Get the non-veggie dinner for 2. You will not regret it. Great variety, good portions, quick and fast and hot delivery.   Prefer this over Maharani!"}
{"text":"This place hit the spot for a craving for Indian food I had.  Came here for lunch and happened upon the lunch buffet, which is a great deal.  The food was very tasty and I got to sample a whole bunch of different dishes.  If I remember correctly there were about 10-15 different dishes available in the buffet line.  The mango and coconut ice cream dessert topped things off for us.  All of this for $9.95.  A couple more bucks for 2 mango lassis that we had with the meal.    Afterwards we promptly went home and passed out for a couple hours with food coma."}
{"text":"I can mainly attest to the ability of this place to provide semi-off the shelf catering solutions.  We host a party annually for Diwali, and usually have Naan and Chicken Tikka ordered from this place as appetizers and bread (we make the other stuff ourselves for the party--its part of the fun).  The Chicken Tikka and Naan are delicious and the service is great.  Regardless of who picks up the food, the owners usually invite the picker upper to enjoy some tea with them.  The people who run this place are lovely (the past few years have been tough with the demolition of St. Francis Hospital in front of them and the construction of a new Children's Hospital they have lost virtually all of their lunch traffic--construction workers not being the usual target market for Indian food joints.  Now that Children's is coming back on line, I expect them to reap the benefit.  This is a great place with very nice people running the place.    As far as decor etc.  Do not expect too much.  Upscale Indian is still restricted to a few cities like New York, DC, Chicago, and San Francisco in the US.  My personal experience with upscale Indian is that you will in fact get delicate flavors, fusion and some interesting dishes...but in my mom's words, you will also get \"Indian food for the faint of heart.\""}
{"text":"Great sauces, wonderful meats!!  The meat is always tender.  The prices are a little below average, which is nice.  I never get the buffet so nothing to say on that.  The nan was perfectly cooked.  The only problem is that they don't deliver.  Great!!  One of my favorite Indian places in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"One of the few authentic Indian restaurants with super-nice servers. Had a fantastic experience with some great suggestions and service. I asked my server to suggest me the best that they have. So he gets 'Baingan Bharta' (Eggplant curry) for me along with naan bread which was delicious. Then I ordered rice pudding for dessert and after a couple of minutes, informed my server that the bus I am supposed to take is arriving shortly. So he goes on and packs the dessert for me very courteously. Also, he forgot to add the pudding in the bill. When I informed him, he shrugged it off and said thats totally fine and to not worry about that. So, I just left him a larger tip that covered the cost of the dessert too! All in all, a great experience and my first review."}
{"text":"We love Taste of India.  Unlike some other Indian food places, when I leave here, I feel great and as if my meal choices were not as unhealthy as they could be.  I always seem to opt for the Tandoori chicken and some naan... But the Tikka masala is another goodie.    The space is nice and clean, the lunch buffet also appears to be kept in good shape and clean too... A huge plus where buffets are concerned.  I always get the same few things here and everything has been good, and service has been quick and friendly.    As I write this, I am being reminded that I am due for a dinner here.  If you haven't been here and like Indian food, I suggest checking it out :)"}
{"text":"The food is very good quality. At some other Indian restaurants, the chicken tastes tinny as its probably a few days old, I haven't tasted that here. The servers were helpful and enthusiastic. It decor is a bit simple and dark. But I definitely enjoyed the experience nonetheless."}
{"text":"If I could give this minus 5 stars, I would. I ordered lamb, and I specifically said, I want the lamb cooked medium rare and more on the rare not the medium. Can you do that? The woman said uh, yes. 30 minutes later, I beckoned her to the table and asked, Are you SURE my lamb in going to come through that door PINK? If it's cooking this long, I'm starting to doubt it. She says, Yes Yes. Pink.  We stared up at the ceiling fans ENCRUSTED with black greasy FILTH about 1/4\" thick, which made us want to vomit imagining the condition of the kitchen. 45 minutes from placing the order, my lamb comes out so well done, I couldn't cut it with a knife. I give it back to the server. Seconds later a big sweaty Indian guy comes out and explains to me that it's not possible to cook anything medium rare because the ovens are too hot.   I kept trying to ask him why the server confirmed my order but he talked over me time and time again. Order something else then, he said. You just have to order something else.    We got up and left the restaurant without eating and went over to Taos Restaurant to eat. Horrible food there too. Don't bother."}
{"text":"I love this place! Its the best Indian food I've had in Pittsburgh! I absolutely love the chicken tikka masala, it is sooo good!! My boyfriend and I ordered take out once and I like spicy rating of 1 and he likes a 7 and when we got home and tried it they were both sevens. So if you're really sensitive like me, make sure to double check your order. I would definitely recommend Taste of India! I also really like all the vegetarian options!"}
{"text":"I've been to the lunch buffet here twice.   What strikes me (and I hope doesn't strike you!) is the shortened entrance that's been carved out of wood.   I'm not THAT tall particularly compared to men... but I feel like I barely clear the frame.  Watch for this if you're around 6' or more!   At $12 p/p it's a pretty good deal for NW India fare.  The first time the food was spiced wonderfully but the second time it was spiced to \"not offend\" so I don't really know where the average buffet comes in for spice level.   The food is good and warm and I end up eating a bit more than planned.  Buffet is heavily vegetarian which I like but it's not something everyone wants.  Nann is good and they are fast with the refills.   I find drink service on top of the buffet to be a bit spotty - I think you're expected to just have water? The dessert bar is what stands out above some other options for Indian around there  - I love the mango custard with fruit and it's not something you find on every buffet.    Probably not my favorite Indian buffet or with the most selections but it's definitely the better of them around my home region of town."}
{"text":"5:30pm, worst Baingan Bartha I've ever had. Un-fresh and damn near flavorless all but for some powdery heat. Please invest in fresh chillies; they keep well and will make that \"8\" really pop with flavor."}
{"text":"This place knocked me out.  I had garlic naan and the lamb Shahajahani.  The sauce was so good, I used all the naan to sop it up.  (The waiter told me it was OK to do that.  Not sure if it really was, but I don't care.  I wasn't gonna leave any.)  I travel a lot, and enjoy finding little places like this that are inconspicuous, where you can get great food, great service at a really decent price.  I had what I described above, plus a half-carafe of their house wine (not spectacular, but who cares) for $29, tip included.  And it was a good tip.  The server was very friendly and helpful and took time to help select the best choice for what I was in the mood for. And, he thanked me about six times for coming in, which was really refreshing.  This beats Indian I've had in Boston, New York and Berlin.  Will definitely be back on next trip to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Finding a good Indian restaurant can always be a challenge. Taste of India is certainly decent...nothing more nothing less. Figuring out the optimal day/time to hit the lunch buffet is like trying to find Gujarat on a map. It's really hard, and you're usually wrong the first few times. That's my main complaint with TOI, somedays the food is really good, other days it's just downright criminal. I think I've figured out their system but trying to explain it would be like.....never mind, you get the picture."}
{"text":"The best Indian restaurant in Pittsburgh, or at least up there with the top few.   Service is friendly, the place is nice, and the food is fantastic. The Samosa is a real treat. The Tandoori chicken is amazing.   Never a let down at Taste of India. Solid. Consistent. Great"}
{"text":"So sorry to see the recent sub par reviews. I frequented Taste of India from 00-06, and would have given them 5 stars for food, service, ambiance and selection of Indian beers. Bummer."}
{"text":"My family and I come here so much for the lunch buffet that they know us. I love their lamb masala and chicken tika masala...great nan and samosas :). I don't know if it's all that authentic, but it sure is tasty!"}
{"text":"My coworkers and I came here during our lunch hour. We arrived at 12:15 and saw that the place was empty, it was a bit dark inside, and part of the restaurant smelled like sewage.  We were greeted by this friendly man who told us that there is no buffet since they were preparing for inspection. We got put off by the \"no buffet\" thing and started to walk out. The man then told us he would give us 10% off for the inconvenience if we ate there. So, ok, we agreed to stay and they seated us. There were 5 of us but they only gave us 4 menus. I asked if they had more, but they said those were the only ones they had... ok... so I waited for my turn at one of the menus.  Five minutes later, he took our orders. He said that it will take 15 minutes for us to get our food. We were ok with that since it was around 12:25 and we had time to eat quick and go back to work.... we ended up waiting 30 minutes for our food, so at 12:55 we asked one of our waiters to just pack up our food and we'll just take it to go since we had to get back to work. The waiter started arguing with us and told us we should eat there. What??? He refused to give us to go boxes and insisted we eat there. It took another 15 minutes of us trying to convince this rude guy to give us to go boxes and when we went to pay, they didn't give us the 10% discount that they promised. We ended up late and starving after this incident. We should walked out sooner than that, but we didn't want to be rude.  The sad part is that the food was actually good. I ordered Chiken Bharta. Their food doesn't come with rice so you have to order rice and naan separate. But it was delicious. But we couldn't even enjoy it because we were treated so badly."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite chicken tikka masala and mango lassis in Madison. I think their prices or portions could do better, but in terms of flavor, I always pick Taste of India."}
{"text":"Darren brought me here, and as a Indian food n00b, I was impressed with everything included in the economical Dinner for Two which gets a diner nan, a meat dish, a veggie dish, dal, a dessert, and tea. The tea and kheer was a nice way to cap off the meal. The mango beef and alu palak were superb. I could live on the bread alone. They look to have renovated the place, and Darren said the bathrooms were much nicer this time around."}
{"text":"I had another fantastic dinner at Taste of India!  Try the mixed grill.  It is wonderful!  Dal is excellent also.  If I lived in Madison I would come every week!"}
{"text":"Just had dinner there. We started with the Pakora then I had chicken biryani and my fiance got the tandoori mixed grill. We got the paneer naan and the garlic roti. The Pakora came out and was well portioned and the price was right for $4. Plenty to eat and the plum sauce was very good. Chicken biryani was perfect. Gigantic portion and was customized to the spicy level of 6 that I asked for. Ended up taking more than half home. Tandoori mixed grill was a big portion and tasty but the chicken was just a little dry. Next time we were hoping to order something like a curry to eat with the rice that came with the dish. Everything was very tasty and the portions were ample sized . Wish I had room for dessert. Will definitely be coming back to eat or get carry out soon."}
{"text":"Pros: Ummm, let me get back to ya   Cons:  1. Currently undergoing some kind of exterior construction  2. Food had spices in it, but nothing that made any dish \"pop\"  3. Bathroom is filthy  4. Service was unfriendly  5. Felt ill afterward   Don't waste your time here, there are lots of awesome places to eat in Phoenix."}
{"text":"What happened to this place? I admit that I haven't been here in a while. Used to be bustling with people. Came Saturday night at 6 pm and we were here with just one other couple. The place was designed English pub style with a log bar along the right side of the room with beer and ale  signs all around the dining space. Decor is still there but the server said they stopped serving beer and wine 1 month ago. Food was OK in flavor but minimal portions of chicken and lamb in the dishes. As we departed at 715 we left the place empty with staff sitting at the bar watching TV. At one time this was one of the better Indian places in the Valley-not anymore, unfortunately!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love tikka masala, but I've been struggling to find one without chicken. This is the first time I've ate at taste of india. I ordered take out and got the paneer tikka masala and it was incredible! The sauce, paneer, everything. My friend ordered  the chicken tikka saag, I tasted a bit and it was wonderful too!   Only thing I wasn't the biggest fan of was the aloo paratha nan. It seemed to lack flavor and was a bit rubbery in texture. However we ordered regular and garlic nan as well and they were both wonderful-totally made up for the aloo paratha!  Needless to say, this will now be my go to for Indian food in Pittsburgh. Awesome, awesome, awesome."}
{"text":"Maybe I don't like Indian food, but I just don't like this place. My boyfriend has forced me a few times to go to the lunch buffet. The service usually sucks. We never get soda refills. One of the desserts tasted like Pinesol. It was really weird and we made our friends try it because of how dead on it was."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here.  Service was super friendly and prompt.  The chicken tikka masala is excellent as well as the paneer naan.  I also tried the chicken curry, which used dark meat.  I thought it was just OK because of the poor quality of the chicken.  However, the curry was excellent.  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Excellent dishes and service.  I eat Indian coast to coast and this is excellent quality food.  Nothing fancy about the decorations and humbly set in a strip mall across from UNLV.  Don't be fooled by the setting, the food is top notch."}
{"text":"This is the best Indian Food I have ever had. This makes me sad because I am away from home (Phoenix) at RollerCon, and I won't get as many opportunities to eat here as I would like (every night)!  I decided to eat here with my boyfriend and the restaurant was hosting a HUGE party. There were people and children everywhere. Despite this, the service was excellent and the food was delivered to us in a very timely manner.  The food was mouth-watering heaven-in-a-bowl! I want to eat it EVERY DAY OF MY LIFE. I kept wanting to eat more even after I was past the point of unbuttoning not one, but two of the buttons of my jeans (they're high-waisted, if you're wondering).  Anyway, go here, eat here. It's amazing! We will definitely be coming back when we come back to Vegas for RollerCon or visiting family!"}
{"text":"Walking in from the extreme cold outside, I was first greeted by the nice warm air.  Service was great, fast but yet not too frequent. I ordered the lamb korma and it was outstanding! Serving size was perfect. The raita was great. The spice level I ordered was accurate. To go, my server gave me more rice with my leftovers. All was good and will definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"Place was definitely made for white people. I like my Indian food brown people spicy. I recommend avoiding the lunch buffet, it is pretty uninspired and there isn't a huge selection. The chicken tikka is bland but the vindaloo is pretty good"}
{"text":"Probably 'the cleanest' Indian restaurant in Pittsburgh.  Their presentation is immaculate, and their decor is friendly and inviting.  The pakora offerings here are some of the best for hundreds of miles-- it's a yellowish breading, that's light, not that dark brown usual fried offering.  Many of their dishes are great, and they have a good chutney.  They've been in business more than 20 years and the people who own it are so nice!  So glad they recovered from a kitchen fire a few years back.  It just keeps getting better and better."}
{"text":"That woman that you see in the corner, a table full of food? Yeah - that's me. Don't judge....  I lose all ability to think rationally when I cross through the door. 4 entrees, biryani and a samosa? Yes. Why not? How can I possibly be expected to choose between such flavorful and reasonably priced food? It's the culinary equivalent of Sophie's Choice.  The staff is wonderful, the food is terrific - get the Samosas, saag paneer and dal makhni. Oh, and the tikka masala. And the muglai korma. Or you could do the lunch buffet and save your dignity. But then you wouldn't have leftovers for lunch. And - trust me - you'll want leftovers for lunch."}
{"text":"Taste of India...Your new go-to Indian spot.  I was craving Indian and it's one of those foods that I only let my myself enjoy every now and again. So when I was looking for somewhere to go, I did some digging.  I came across Taste of India and knew I wanted to give it a try. We ordered an array of the usual suspects: vegetable samosas, chicken tikka masala, lamb kofta, and saag paneer. Everything was absolutely delicious! There wasn't enough food to take home, but it was more than enough food that we left stuffed!  When I want a great Indian meal, Taste of India should be the first on your list. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Love this place- I've been here twice so far and each time the food has been delicious and full of flavor."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Indian Restaurant. The food is always fantastically prepared. Service is also wonderful. I've never gone to the buffet, but do take-out and eat-in often. Hint: you get more food when you order take-out. ;)"}
{"text":"This was my first time at taste of India. The service was very pleasant and I found the food and alcoholic beverages to be quite inexpensive. Most importantly, the food was fantastic. The flavors were well balanced and succulent. I will definitely be coming around more often."}
{"text":"I made the mistake of going here once for lunch. Blah. The food wasn't good and the service was bad. They seemed to hate me for some reason."}
{"text":"Second time here.  Food is delicious.  I always order the chicken tikka with a side of masala sauce.  It never disappoints!"}
{"text":"Weekday lunch buffet is only $9/person! Everything was fantastic and the glazed donut holes were a sweet satisfying end to our meal."}
{"text":"I've only eaten here once. This is the second tastiest curry I've had in the states. Vindaloo spice level 7 (they let you choose). Being open late is good business. It was taking many orders at 12:30pm. Recommended."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner once and never tried it again.. Nothing great about food or ambience.. The food is just meh..There are better choices in madison if you want to try Indian food.. I don't understand how does it have a good rating!Seriously!!"}
{"text":"The food is good, and excellently spiced.  Though others on this site have reported not being able to get dishes spicy enough, I've never had that problem (when I've ordered 10 out of 10, I got 10).  In fact, that's one of my favorite things about this restaurant: they cook the food exactly the way I want it, pretty consistently.  Sauces are creamy; meat is tender; and prices are reasonable.  I'd say this is easily one of the better Indian restaurants in the city, which is saying something given the plethora of good options."}
{"text":"Best Indian food in Pittsburgh. I lived in Dubai for several years, and although it's a middle eastern country, there are more Indians there than anyone else and lots of authentic restaurants. This place is the most authentic place in PGH. I have tried almost every other Indian restaurant in Pittsburgh and none of them come close to this place."}
{"text":"The problem is inconsistency.  Sometimes a dish is very good, other times not so good.  Dal Makhni last night was like soup--all liquid, little dal. Lamb Curry lacked flavor when in the past it has been wonderful.  It appears that there are different cooks whose approach to dishes can be radically different.  I'd like to be able to count on a consistent product."}
{"text":"After seeing 4 star i gave shot to this restaurant. First of all i star i gave 3 star for couple of items I ordered and it came out the way i wanted.  I ordered Dal Tadka - i got Dal Makhani  My friend ordered a beer, he got it, when he ordered 2nd one, never came and i asked waiter, he was like or i didnt give u 2nd one yet ?  I am not sure that waiter had a long day or something?   So thats why i took it out 2 star for service.  I will still give a one more shot when i will be in Pittsburgh again. If i will have better service i will change this review and star.  Thanks"}
{"text":"Really nice find in Vegas, and a short trip from the strip.   Food was excellent and the service was great.  Not a huge expert on Indian food but enjoy trying new things.  The management was very kind and helpful and made great suggestions.  Had a very nice meal and would definitely go back.  Only down side is they need to chill the white wine."}
{"text":"First time here and came in on a Saturday night. Pretty busy but attentive staff even with the place full.  Ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala and it was very good. Also ordered a side if plain naan which was some of the best I've had. Very fresh and light.  Overall a good meal, will eat here again to try more of their dishes."}
{"text":"Good food, good ambiance, great location!  I went to this place a long time back when they first opened. The buffet spread then was not as extensive as some of the other Indian restaurants (e.g., Maharaja). However, what they lacked in food variety, they made up in taste and ambiance. And with its location on Monroe street, it's hard to go wrong with this choice."}
{"text":"Located in close proximity to UNLV, the décor is very basic.  We received both garlic and plain naan, neither of which could possibly have been made in house. Service was friendly, but we were two of only 3-4 customers during our entire stay.  I managed to sample most of the standard buffet items offered with none considered a standout and a few stinkers.  The temperature of the food, varying from hot to tepid, was the biggest problem.  Overall I felt our meal was just okay and not worthy of a return visit."}
{"text":"Amazing like usual. While waiting they offered tea and were very hospitable while I was there. Food is always on point got the dinner for two and it's a deal for the price"}
{"text":"Ive been here 15+ times. Great food , quick service and for Indian its at the top of my list. Well worth a visit."}
{"text":"Tried Lunch buffet $12.99- veggie pakoras not as flavourful as expected but fish, black lentils, butter chicken and paneer were nicely spiced to make my nose sweat. Goat curry was also good and not too greasy.   Mango sauce was to die for. We dipped our fish tikka into it. I'm sure that's not customary but we loved the flavour blend!!!  My 9 year old son said mango sauce was perfectly smooth, not too thick or sweet and I totally agree!  He's a future helper in the making   Very large interior with a good selection of alcohol and non-alcoholic beverages. Place is clean and neat. Our server was polite and efficient and asked if we needed more naan. My only complaint is the naan was not hot when it arrived at our table. You don't have to ask for it but it's not on the buffet table.  Overall, this was a good lunch find in the NW just off Stoney Trail in Creekside Centre. Will be back again!"}
{"text":"This is the restaurant where I bring people when I want to impress them with the great Indian food in Pittsburgh - twice now, I've gotten the special meal for two, and not only is it flavorful and well-spiced (I feel like they're great at matching the spice level you request - and other people dining with me agreed), it's a good value - so much food that you can easily make another meal out of the leftovers.  The lamb dishes are delicious; I've had the Boti-Kabab Masala and Lamb Sag, but I really enjoyed the vegetarian dish I had, Hariyali Handi (vegetables in spinach), so much so that I've had it both times and may not be able to stop myself from ordering it again. My real yardstick for greatness, though is the samosas: when you order the special meal, they come along as part of the deal - it would be easy to take less care with a \"throwaway\" item, but they are quite simply the best samosas I have ever had, slightly spicy, super-crispy, and big enough to share.  The bill comes on a tiny tray filled with sugar crystals, caraway and coriander seeds and colorful bits of candy - I've seen similar combinations at other Indian restaurants, but it's artfully presented, and as with the rest of Taste of India, it leaves me charmed and satisfied, just as an excellent restaurant should."}
{"text":"I really like this place. Generous portions, well spiced, good service, BYOB. I really like their veggie ball in yogurt sauce thing. Free papadam, and the gratis chutneys have been different each time I've been."}
{"text":"I don't recommend this restaurant nor will I ever go back.    Food is mediocre.  Staff has trouble communicating and is unfriendly.  Food took an unusually long time to come out.    Go down the street to I-17 and Bell Road to India Palace instead."}
{"text":"Loved it! Absolutely LOVED it! The BF and I went here over the weekend and it was wonderful. We started out with the chicken samosas. I would have probably preferred the traditional potato and pea, but the chicken was still delicious. Delicious enough that I finished mine first and kinda wanted to grab his and run out the door with it. For our entrees he got the Tandoori grill, which is basically an amazing array of MEAT! (when you see this plate, you'll understand why it cannot be called just 'meat'.) Now, I am by no means a vegetarian, but when we are taking Indian Cuisine, I usually opt for a veggie option. Simply because they are so good. While I can say his was a carnivore's delight I prefer something to accompany my MEAT! He suggested I get the Tikka Masala, so I did. Words cannot describe how much I loved this Masala. I would have to create a new word, like fanterrifayummuniciuos...ness. I wanted to lick the bowl, and then ask if I could lick the pot they made it in. He had the kheer for dessert. It was pretty good but I was still obsessing about the Masala, so I'm not sure I got the full effect. The service is mostly provided by an older Indian couple (I assumed the owned it) and is exemplary. Now, it was empty on a Saturday night, (which makes me nervous) so it should be exemplary, but quickly you realize that most of their business is take out. Eat in or Take out, but I would seriously try this place.  *Although we did not get it, I would try the dinner for two. It comes with tandoori chicken, a meat dish, a veggie dish, dal, rice, kheer and a tea of some kind- all for $36!*"}
{"text":"All time favorite Indian lunch buffet!  Lots of meat & vegetarian options.  Also has friendly service. Would recommend. I crave it on a regular basis. I leave full & happy every time:)"}
{"text":"Worst buffet!!! Cost is 13 $ without tax. It's not worthy. Worst indian restaurant in LV."}
{"text":"I agree with the other reviewers here on yelp.   Food is good quality but not very spicy so it's OK for a lunch buffet.   Very clean dining room and bathrooms.  Service is fine as far as a lunch buffet goes.  The iced tea was better here than other ethnic restaurants, it had a hint cardamom or cinnamon that was interesting."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite Indian restaurants when I lived closer. The last time that I visited it wasn't as spectacular as it used to be, but it is still really good and I would recommend it. It is nice dining, linen table clothes and napkins, well dressed staff, so it can be a nice evening out, but you wouldn't feel out of place dressed casually, either. The service is good and the menu has a lot of great items. And, of course, a great selection of vegetarian dishes, as most Indian restaurants."}
{"text":"I have been really struggling to find a good indian place in Pittsburgh, since I moved back into town.  I ordered takeout from Taste of India, and it was ready very quickly (~15 minutes).  I ordered the Saag paneer, chicken tikka masala and an order of plain and garlic naan.  The naan was amazing!  My girlfriend who doesn't even really like Indian food loved the Chicken tikka masala, which was also really good.  The chicken was of really good quality and the sauce was delicious.  I also enjoyed the saag paneer, but probably not the best i've ever had.  Either way, the food was delicious and I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Buffet, while small is totally worth it. Has all the essentials!"}
{"text":"A dinner at Taste of India 18 years ago marked my initial experience with Indian food, one that dented my palate irreparably. I recall how taken I was with Lamb Curry, Nan, and the ambrosial, exotic Mulligatawny soup. After one evening in a modest Lawrenceville storefront, a new cuisine had captured my imagination, heart, and palate.  When I worked at the defunct St. Francis Medical Center across the street, Taste of India became an occasional takeout or dine-in treat. Before the other night, however, I had neglected TOI for around a decade.  When Kay and I arrived at TOI the other night, I was surprised, pleasantly so, to see that the drab outer decor had been replaced with a modern sheen.   As soon as we sat down, the gentleman I remembered as the owner brought us water and papadum with a red and green chutney. When the cracker broke underneath my teeth, crushing the sweet, crimson peppers atop it, the love I felt in 1994 returned, flooding my mind with memories.  I had come very close to going with what I first dined upon way back then, but when we saw the economical Dinner For Two option, Kay blurted out \"Mango Beef.\"  The Dinner For Two includes two somosas, a meat dish, a vegetarian dish, tandoori chicken, nan, dal, rice, a choice of dessert, and tea to end it.   Our chosen meat dish, Mango Beef, favorably recalled the Lamb Curry with its thickened, citrus-ordained gravy and cubes of soft, appetizing protein. Although it originated a world away, I felt comforted by this stew, the delicate rice underneath it, and the overall warmth that filled my stomach because of it.   The vegetarian dish, Alu Palak, was the Mango Beef's plant-based opposite number in everyway. Potatoes played the part of meat, the creamed spinach acting as a lush, meatless goulash.   Craving the Mulligatawny soup, I amended my order, sneaking it in between our appetizer in the duo of large, crackling, rich somosas and the tandoori chicken. Once again, as I carefully sipped the searing broth, I felt a sort of solace and cultural unity. My grandmother ground up green peas to make pea soup for her grandchildren. Surely an Indian child's nana did the same with lentils for her. A hint of spice awakened my sleeping soul enough to let me know I was consuming something that was not native to this country, but the soup's creaminess and luxuriousness had me feeling as if a kiss on the cheek from an elderly woman was imminent.   Pieces of blazing, hissing, pyrotechnic, bloodshot scarlet Tandoori Chicken came next on a plate of cast iron surrounded by caramelized onions and peppers. No dryness or toughness could be detected, not even on the breasts and certainly not the thigh or leg. Tandoori Chicken is a drama for the eyes and nose as well as the mouth, and this was a performance worthy of a standing, thundering ovation. Juices secreted with each cut and bite and were made sweet by the onions and peppers, never, ever to be forgotten.  Who could forget the downy flaps of nan that came in a basket and were used to soak up every other dish's remainder, including the bean-abundant dal that sadly was overwhelmed by the enormous flavors of everything else?  It is easy to see why nan is a staple used in lieu of utensils, and TOI's serving was a gentle reminder of why this is. Put some of their nan and a bowl of their Mulligatawny soup in front of me for lunch, and I need nothing else, not even meat, to complete my meal.  For dessert we opted for the easy, cool, milky, pearly pleasures of the Kheer, which once more gladdened us as much as the rest of the meal had being that this is how India does rice pudding. Almond slices added a vaguely roustic touch to what is arguably the safest dish of all, the dairy exorcising any spice-borne demons that still loitered on our tongues.   I do not normally enjoy hot tea, but the tea served to us along with our kheer was indescribably reinvigorating.  TOI has seemingly been reinvigorated also. Even their dingy bathroom of a decade ago has since been revamped. Today it is colorful, clean, and the steps leading down to it are now carpeted.    Your dinner at Taste of India will be a journey. Each step will be a lesson that leads you towards knowing a love that has many shades and speaks many tongues but has no national bounds."}
{"text":"Taste of India is right in the middle of the pack as far as Indian lunch buffets go in the Madison area. It isn't for lack of quality, they are pretty good -- it's just that their selection is a little on the smaller side and parking can be challenging because of the size of the parking lot.  All told they didn't have any stand-out dish but everything was consistently pretty good. If a friend or colleague wanted to go there for lunch I certainly wouldn't say no to a second shot at some point in the future but they would not be my first choice, but certainly not my last."}
{"text":"I had a great meal here last night food was very tasty, there were six of us and we had a very nice meal for just under $100. Very authentic Indian food."}
{"text":"The tiki masala and lamb were delicious!  The staff is super friendly. Must try the pistachio qulfi!"}
{"text":"Tried the vegetarian thali ($12ish) and was really impressed by the quality, variety, and spiciness to order.  Will head back here with a smile."}
{"text":"Buffet was decent.  Food wasn't all the hot and was rather bland.  Chicken curry had some funky pieces of chicken in it that didn't look too appetizing.  Parking is not good with the children's hospital across the street. Tea was good.  In my opinion People's down the street is better.  Also, not much to choose from in the buffet."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great service, great prices. Great buffet for lunch and quick take out. I LOVE this place!"}
{"text":"I moved to Pittsburgh about a year ago and this is my favorite take out I've had in the city! Very reasonably priced with large portions. We had the butter chicken and alu gobhi - both were excellent. We also each got an order of vegetable samosas. Each order comes with 2 so we could have gotten away with splitting 1 order. They let you pick your spice level - I picked 8 for my alu gobhi and it was very hot. My friend picked 1 for the butter chicken. Zero complaints about my experience here! I will definitely return to dine in."}
{"text":"Just stopped for lunch before driving off. Food was below average. They had about 3 vegetable dishes and 3 chicken dishes. Nothing great .. Probably won't ever go back."}
{"text":"Ordered through Grubhub and this was my first indian food experience since moving to Pittsburgh. My partner and I ordered a chicken dish and a vegetarian dish and thought both dishes were ok, but not crave-worthy. Will probably order from them again given there are not many options in the area, just not sure how often."}
{"text":"Best indian food in the locality. Hospitable hosts, custom made orders and what not. Make sure you try the ghee pongal and their masala dosa when you are here. Their lunch buffet is reasonably priced and will not disappoint you for sure."}
{"text":"This is clearly the best Indian restaurant in town.  Having moved to Madison form Chicago several years ago, I bemoaned the lack of high quality Indian restaurants.  I found the local favorites to be highly over-rated.  That is, until Taste of India opened.  My 5- and 8-year old daughters have come to love Indian food as a result of regularly eating here.    The lunch buffet is small, but what is offered is excellent.  My preferred meal is dinner: my favorite dish is Chili Chicken (nice and spicy). Other excellent dishes include Mango Chicken, Malai Kofta and Aloo Gobhi.  Incidentally, Swagat (also relatively new) is also excellent, but Taste of India has the edge with its location on charming Monroe Street."}
{"text":"Rubbery, nearly raw, white outside, pink inside chicken in two different buffet dishes.  I hope they looked at my plate to try to figure out why i simply got up and left, but in my opinion, if you are incompetent enough to put an entire serving tray of undercooked poultry out on a lukewarm steamtable, then anything I can try to explain about what was wrong, will likely fall on deaf ears anyway."}
{"text":"I visit family in Pittsburgh often and we are Indian. We have had dinner at Taste of India several times and we like the food and atmosphere. It's northern cuisine and while it's not the best we've ever had, it's very good and this is our favorite Indian restaurant in the city. We like that the food is quality, the service is good and Bollywood isn't blaring from TVs while you are trying to converse.  Definitely try this restaurant out if you'd like a good meal in a pleasant atmosphere."}
{"text":"Grabbed the buffet for a quick meal. We arrived a little later in the lunch time and the place was empty. The food was old. Only 1 vegetarian option. And it wasn't great. They did make us fresh bread which I appreciated. We ordered one thing off the menu and it was okay. Bathrooms were in the basement down steep stairs, a little creepy. I wouldn't go here again."}
{"text":"The Indian food here is perfectly decent, but nothing mind-blowing. The lunch buffet comes with a lassi or mango juice, which is a nice touch, but the other offerings are standard.   The owners are very sweet and the service is fine. When I've waited for take out before after I walked in the snow I was given warm tea while I waited, which was very kind.  On the whole though, the food is pretty lackluster. A little further down Penn Ave, I prefer People's Indian."}
{"text":"I propose that Taste of India get a new, fresh yelp! review site.  Taste of India is dead, long live Taste of India!    The new, post-fire establishment is completely new and different.  The space inside has booths, nice tables, a new and improved kitchen, even better bathrooms.  I cannot overstate how much better it is than in the past.  Most importantly, the lunch buffet has catapulted from kind of bland if serviceable, to downright excellent.  I hate to say it, but it's my new favorite buffet for lunch.    I'm serious, Rachel, you should close their old reviews and have them start fresh (with my review).  And for all the people who went there in the past and maybe didn't have a great experience (or did) you need to go again!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were long overdue for a date night.   We had some coupons to choose from and Kathy decided on Taste of India. We arrived just before the dinner rush kicked in. We went with the non-vegetarian dinner for 2: Rice Pullao and Fresh Onion Chutney, Mint Chutney,  Tamarind Sauce. Chicken Pakora, Chicken Tikka Masala, Lamb Curry, Tandoori Chicken and Nan and Gulab Jamun Dessert.  The food came out in 3 courses:  Chicken Pakora - App, The Entre items, then dessert.  Too much for the 2 of us to finish so we brought the leftovers home to enjoy.  The service was attentive, but not bothersome, and the food was very good.  We will be going back."}
{"text":"Great service and even better food! Everything from the vegetable samosas to the garlic nan to the perfectly cooked Aloo Goobi (served with unlimited basmati rice that was as fluffy as a cloud) was perfectly seasoned and absolutely delicious! The serving sizes were ample and the prices were fair. Yum!"}
{"text":"The food here is good, but it didn't knock my socks off (or in this case my flip flops).  My group ordered quite a few dishes to share, I chose the Chicken Vindaloo and each dish was good but I've had better. They really don't do spicey very well, but I can take a lot of heat, so I guess it is all in perspective. The place is very clean, the staff is friendly, and their appetizers were fantastic.  I will probably come back, but there is no sense of urgency."}
{"text":"Not fancy but great Indian food at a really reasonable price. The eggplant was particularly yummy."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant.  Beautifully remodeled inside, the most delicious Indian cuisine, and an extremely courteous and welcoming staff. The BEST Indian food in the city hands down!"}
{"text":"If you really know and like Indian cuisine then food here gonna be flavorless and bland for you. Tandoori chicken doesn't taste like one etc. Decor is tasteless and old. Carpet looks really dirty. I'm definitely not coming back."}
{"text":"Very good food and service. I was craving a good tikki masala and this hit the spot. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"This was one of the first restaurants I visited when I moved to the Pittsburgh area, but I hadn't been back in a few years. It's a shame that I haven't made more of an effort, because this is the best Indian restaurant in the metro area. I wouldn't rank it among the best I have ever visited -- that spot is held by Quilon in (St. James) London. It's at the top of the +/-12 I have frequented in Pittsburgh over the last 15+ years.  Let me start by saying I RARELY eat from a buffet; I always order off the menu.  I'm one of those weird curry junkies who believe the use of spices and seasoning shouldn't amount to a burning mouth. Spicy doesn't just mean hot! Taste of India's spices are nuanced and every dish has a distinct set of flavors. It's so odd that so many restaurants around Pittsburgh can't say the same."}
{"text":"Jordan & I have been eating Taste of India at CMU for a while, without knowing it was Taste of India.  At CMU they offer super inexpensive lunches that are more filling than anywhere else to eat at lunch. During this winter break, we have been going through some serious withdraw while the cafe is closed.  Thank you YELPERS once again, in our search to satiate our curry addiction, we have found our distributor!  We were excited to read that this restaurant supplied our weekly lunches and we ordered!!  I ordered the Alu Matar Mushroom at a spicy rating of 3 (yes, I'm a sissy), but it was EXACTLY what I wanted!!  Jordan ordered Alu Gobhi which was cauliflower & potato at a spicy rating of 5.  We truly weren't sure how to scale our tolerance; but we decided that next time we could both go hotter.  We also can't wait to try the Lunch Buffet! We really wish we would have known that this existed during the week in between Christmas & New Years when we were fiending for Indian food.  Now that we know, I have no doubt we will soon become regulars.  We have also tried Tamarind in Oakland, but that place just made my mouth go numb after it was all said and done (and left me with an unpleasant digestion experience).  All of the bad cliche things you hear about Indian food, is nothing like Taste of India.  You can taste the love cooked in."}
{"text":"Took family to dinner to celebrate a birthday.    Food was amazing.  Recommend goat karai, sheesh kabab and chilli chicken.   Friendly staff and very accommodating"}
{"text":"We have been here twice a it's been great. We definitely recommend it. Good is amazing."}
{"text":"The service is okay, not great. The selection is not that many though they have coconut ice-cream in addition to their mango one.  The taste is not spectacular either.  I was a bit disappointed that the waiter didn't come to fill up our glasses until I asked them to do so. Not sure if we want to be back. Other place offers a much better choice."}
{"text":"We got the butter chicken, curry chicken they where both very good! The veggie samosa was good but the chicken samosa wasn't the best I have had. Most Indian food restaurants I have been too they give you rice with the order thinking I would get the rice with the delivery, I didn't that was really the only down side."}
{"text":"I rated 4 stars only because of my husband. He loves that place and orders take out pretty often. Last time we decided to stay inside and I wanted to taste spicy dish.  Usually I don`t eat spicy food as I often suffer from my stomachaches. But sometimes I crave it so much and that was that time. I asked about \"4\" (scale of spiciness between 1 to 10). For non-indian people 4 is suppose to mean that it`s a slightly spicy, less then medium. That idea was in my head. But when I got my mango chicken I could barely taste it. It was sooooo spicy. I felt myself like a dragon. For me it was 8 or even 9. I was not able finishing my food. And didn`t even think about enjoying it:((((   Why do they ask about how do we want our food if they have only 2 option - no spicy or super hot spicy?"}
{"text":"Edit: New ownership noticed 2008.   Tasty Indian cuisine with a British influence. Pub side has mostly British ales and are served in traditional, Imperial pint glasses.  Food is average and in line with most Indian Cuisine in the Phoenix area. Chana Masala with garlic naan is an exceptional combination at this location. Appetizers are high quality as well.   Prices/portions are on par for most restaurants.  Service is about average as well - sometimes great, sometimes good, and sometimes poor."}
{"text":"Good Indian food is tough to find. We ate their on a quiet weekday night. Service was friendly to the point that I though we might be friends. The portion sizes are big, food is well prepared, and over delivered on taste."}
{"text":"The best Indian food, but never see them been very busy ... Wish they are in the better location and hope their business will get better...."}
{"text":"Overall, this place was great. Won't be visiting Las Vegas for a long time but would recommend to my friends here.  Pros: - Really great Indian food. The chicken was very rich and juicy and the naan was spectacular - Lots of places to sit and no waiting time - Nice clean and quiet setting - Awesome price for the buffet  Cons: - Not a lot of food choices - Food a little on the oily side - Employees barely keeping up with the small capacity (had to wait for bowls and rice at one point) * To be fair, I may have come with 8 people on a day when they didn't expect a lot of people"}
{"text":"Good punjabi food. Fresh tasting and just the right amount of spices. Yellow dal tadka, panner bhurji and palak paneer were excellent.  Very friendly staff ."}
{"text":"I would give 3.5 starts if I could. The food was alright. I went for the buffet and I tried alitttle bit of every thing they had. Some of the food I did not like but all the different type of currys where really good. The buttered chicken was good and I would suggest that you come for their buffet. First try out the taj beer!! Try this place out for yourself,the staff are nice here and don't forget to try their mango dessert."}
