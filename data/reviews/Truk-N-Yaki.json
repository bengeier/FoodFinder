{"text":"This food truck is AMAZING. The menu is simple, the food is divine, and the owners are great. Just named one of the top ten best Las Vegas restaurants by USA Today, and that's competing with all the high end restaurants on the Strip. You'll have this once, and crave it every day. As far as specific recommendation- I always get the chicken burrito. They're usually open outside of Kao at Spring Mountain and Wynn, Wednesday nights from 10pm - 2am."}
{"text":"Had Truknyaki at the Sunset Park food truck event.
Amazing food.
Cooked to order. I guess they are pretty popular, the line was long and due to the fact it is prepared to order there was a wait for food. Worth the wait. Their custom sauce was to die for. I have never had food of this quality from a food truck."}
{"text":"Beyond delicious! Especially coming from a food truck. If someone served this in a restaurant to you and didn't tell you it was from a food truck, you probably wouldn't even guess it's food truck food. You'd think it's restaurant food. That's how good it is! Their ribeye on fried rice is on point! So is their burrito! The service is friendly and I will surely come back to eat here!"}
{"text":"Glad to see Truknyaki added to the rotation of food trucks at UNLV. Added some much needed change to the line-up that has been there in semesters past. Food was good - I had the chicken burrito - was tasty but a little heavy on the rice. They only have 3 options - ribeye, chicken or shrimp and either plate of burrito. 
Biggest problem though was the price. $9 for a chicken burrito. Prices only go up from there. For a few bucks cheaper I can get Chipotle or Cafe Rio with similar quality. 
I could see myself going again, but for the price it wouldn't be more than once a semester/"}
{"text":"Was at valvatine rabbit for a drink with some friends and all of a
Sudden this awesome looking food truck rolled up. I  see food trucks a lot in Hawaii and LA but wow!  this one got the whole bar to unload oitside! People came in talking about the food and how good it was. I let the line die down a bit then headed out to try it. Was recommended the Japanese buritto by there very friendly cashier. Wow this buritto was like no other burito I have had. Sooo bomb!!! A must have"}
{"text":"I got to try this food truck out at First Friday last night.  It was oh so delicious!  I got a chicken japanese burrito and it was really tasty!  And the price was really reasonable.  I'm a big fan and hope to see them next First Friday!"}
{"text":"went with my roommate and boyfriend at Atomic Liquors on Friday night to have a couple of cocktails.. all of a sudden a tray of large sized samples toted by a sweet blonde girl caught the eye of the boys. she let us know that its was from the food truck \" Truck-N-Yaki\", parked right outside.  the samples werent super hot, obviously, but even so, they were so good and after one more cocktail, we all found ourselves hungry and wanting more. I headed out to the truck and ordered two chicken and fried rice bowls since they were only $4 a piece. the portions are huge for what you are paying too. service was very fast , as i only waited about 2 minutes. Seriously, SOOOO freakin good and such sweet people operating. I found myself daydreaming about it at work today.  long story short, we had two orders, then ordered two more on our way to the car!!! better than a lot of restaurants Ive tried since moving to Vegas. if you are passing by and see the truck, STOP!"}
{"text":"Ribeye burrito Haha.. tasted worse than the old microwaved bean burritos... Loaded with cartilage, tough, inedible bla.  No more food trucks for me. UGH!  JKKUHL"}
{"text":"I know there is a lot of hype around food trucks these days, but it's rare I catch a really good one. Truk-N-Yaki is one of them. I love my burritos & have my favs from various places. Truk-N-Yaki is now apart of that list. I ordered a combo burrito w/ chicken & shrimp. It came w/ fried rice & veggies. Super flavorful. W/ flavors like that I'll be coming back anytime I see them."}
{"text":"I love this truck! Every time this truck visits my work, I always choose them. I really enjoy the shrimp plate with fried rice. I've also tried their ribeye plate with fried rice but in my opinion, it was way too salty. Especially when I got to the bottom of the bowl. Good thing is, they really don't skimp on the protein! I have yet to try their other combinations but I look forward to trying more next time they stop by my work again! 

Service is also great and quick. Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Excellent! Spicy chicken burrito was a big hit at SEMA. Hope you expand to So Cal soon."}
{"text":"Got the ribeye Japanese burrito from this truck at world market today. Tasty food, incredible sauces, and the house made sauces were the slam! On point! Will be looking for this truck in the future!"}
{"text":"Went to there truck at Ces had a huge line so I was excited, took 35 minuets to come out and they got my order wrong! They got me a new plate fast and I think they hooked me up with extra meet. Beef was okay nothing special shrimp was good not over cooked. Fried rice tasty but little undercooked. Wasn't to original but meat was done right. I would go back if there wasn't a wait."}
{"text":"Wow, why haven't I tried this sooner?!  Life was beautiful at the \"Life is Beautiful\" festival simply after taking one bite of this food truck's Japanese Burrito.  

Think chicken teriyaki wrapped up into a burrito.  The chicken was perfect in here.  I'm talking super flavorful, tender, and moist.  My wife compared it to eating the from the best Chicken and Rice halal dish in NYC!  That says a lot!

The burrito was so good and the food truck will be something I'll be constantly tracking down anywhere in Las Vegas.  Definitely looking forward to trying their other meat selections as well as their Teriyaki bowls.  

If you haven't came across this gem yet, I suggest you do something about that now!  It's really that good!"}
{"text":"lots of rice in the burrito. not much meat. it was kind of bland unless you put some hot sauce on the burrito. maybe i've been eating too salty lately...? very cool concept though"}
{"text":"Shockingly GOOD!  First time trying this truck, we ordered the \"shrimp burrito\" it was amazing, full of flavor, perfectly seasoned and loaded with all things teppanyaki.  The shrimp were plump and fresh, which I was a little worried about since we live in the hot desert. Putting everything inside a tortilla is genius, as it can be difficult to eat with a traditional knife and fork when you don't have a table."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time during this every 3rd Thursday event downtown. I had the japanese shrimp burrito with a soda. Love the spiciness to it and honestly sad to say I had to babysit this burrito being full half way. Delicious!"}
{"text":"This truck has come to my office multiple times now, so I figured it must be worth a try. I ordered the rib-eye burrito, and at $12 I had really high hopes that it would be amazing. It was decent, but nothing special...certainly not worth the cost. The meat was scant, the rice was overflowing, and the onions were in large chunks (far bigger than I like). The meat was just average in flavor, and on the tough side of the spectrum. I had a side of sweet sauce, which turned out to be just soy sauce? ? 

I ended up re-wrapping the second half, because the ingredients were not mixed together. In my first half, most of the meat was at the bottom, and most of the rice was at the top. I ate it because I was hungry and paid a lot of money for the food...but I don't think I'll be coming back to this truck. I REALLY wanted to love this burrito. But sad to say, I could make something better at home."}
{"text":"Ordered a chicken burrito ($8) between class periods and they made an immediate loyal fan. While there was a lot of rice, the sauce added enough flavor to make up for it. The mix of onions, zucchini, and mushrooms is a definite favorite for both texture and taste. There was an included cup of sauce that added heat and a hint of sweetness, though it was a bit hard to dip without spilling rice. It's hibachi in a tortilla, and that's pretty much all I could ask for out of lunch.

My only issues were the limited drink selection (water, Sprite, and Pepsi) and that the chicken was a bit gristly. Everything was delicious and served quickly."}
{"text":"Out of all the trucks at First Friday, Truk-N-Yaki had me at two words: Japanese burritos.

Now, they're not quite sushi burritos, which are literally giant rolls of sushi masquerading as burritos, but they do come pretty close! The burrito wrap is a tortilla, grilled to perfection and much more akin to what you'd expect when ordering a burrito. Every bite was a mouthful of well-cooked sushi rice, veggies, and a protein of your choosing (we all opted for shrimp) with a choice of spicy or sweet sauce for dipping. 

I will say $12 a burrito is a little steep (especially when you order 3 and you're like \"$36 for 3 burritos?!\") and I'd prefer a price point between $8-10. But.... they were frikkin' delicious. So pay what you must."}
{"text":"Just had their beef and prawn Japanese burrito at the Las Vegas Foodie Fest.... It was absolutely delicious!! The sweet sauce that they make is to die for- I wish they sold it!! Definitely exceeded my expectations :) will absolutely eat at this truck again!!"}
{"text":"Had their teriyaki chicken burrito tonight at the Las Vegas Speedway. So delicious and filling. Wish they were in LA!  Friendly service and their homemade teriyaki sauce and spicy sauce are just right. Not overly salty. All fresh ingredients I was told.  It tasted like it too. Delicious."}
{"text":"Some of the best food-truck food I've ever had!!  They're here at the convention center Beer Garden tent serving food for the InfoComm show.  Yesterday we tried the chicken teriyaki and it was wonderful!  Excellent seasoning and flavor, and the fried rice is done to perfection.

Today we had the Ribeye dish and again, some of the yummiest food from a truck I've ever had.  Same awesome fried rice as yesterday.

Pricing is typical \"food truck\" pricing - not elevated just because they're at a major trade show.

If you're at a show and these guys show up, skip the crap from the LVCC food service and wander outside to the Truk-N-Yaki truck - you won't regret it.

{"text":"Sunset Park'd event and the Japanese Burrito sounded good and could have been better. I ordered the Burrito with ribeye and it only took a few minutes. If you remember the old Wendy's commercial with the old woman saying repetitively \"where's the beef\" this burrito would be perfect for that commercial. About 90 percent rice the veggies and ribeye are just a few chunks in each half. You definitely gets bites with no meat. Flavors were good and the sauce had a little spice to it but not worth the $11 they charge. Now I know why there was no line!"}
{"text":"They've been around for almost two years, but I only just tried this local truck today at the overpriced Great American Foodie Fest. (Not entirely my choice, so don't judge.)

Truk-N-Yaki bills itself as somewhat of a Japanese steakhouse on wheels. They offer a simple menu of rice plates and burritos, with the same protein options for each: chicken, shrimp, and ribeye.

My mom thought that the ribeye burrito ($12 at this event) sounded relatively interesting out of the available foods at Foodie Fest, so we got it. It was conveniently sliced in half on the diagonal and had a medium-spicy sauce on the side.

The burrito was hot and pretty rich in flavor, the protein portion was sufficient, the ribeye was meaty yet tender and the shell was crispy. The sauce was nice but not essential. I enjoyed it overall, but the flavors weren't mindblowing and the portion was very modest.

I liked them, but this could've easily been a 3-star review if they'd been slightly more stingy with the meat. Maybe I'll try them again after I've explored the rest of the local Asian truck scene."}
{"text":"Tasted like a frozen dinner. The meat in the steak burrito tasted like it had freezer burn. Go back to the drawing board. Japanese and Mexican food does not mix well together."}
{"text":"We were lucky to catch this place at a food truck event at Sunset Park one time, some time ago. YUMMY food! This was the best in the food truck arena, in my opinion (I've tried a few). I had the teriyaki dish and so did my husband. I love fusion food (but sadly, some miss the mark). Not this one! I've tried a few and I've got my favorites. This place easily falls into the category of \"my favorites.\"

The quality of the ingredients is important. Isn't it terrible when you get a stir-fry dish that has mushy veggies? Not the case here. I like my stir-fry veggies crisp-tender. The flavors are equally important. What I mean by this, is that they all have to come together, and not overpower each other, if that makes any sense. If there's too much sauce, then it's too sweet, ya know? The portion size is also important (lots of food trucks are pretty skimpy). It was a good size, satisfying and substantial. The price is also a factor. It wasn't breaking the bank (some food trucks are outrageous). Oh, and the wait wasn't too bad, either. So, when all of these, are on point, you really take notice, and the lasting impression/ memory is enough to try to follow up and try to catch this food truck at another event. (Note: I really did take my time to enjoy and savor this yumminess, because I didn't want to rush through it.) 

We really want to have this yummy teriyaki dish again (Hubby loved it too!!!)! I think I need to check out their website again very soon."}
{"text":"They were so friendly and willing to assist me in all of my boogie particular ordering specifications (accommodating AF). Not only that, but they were fantastic. Unbelievably good. I got the Japanese burrito with medium rare ribeye and shrimp. 

Let me tell you... if one of these shrimp trucks exploded and killed us right now, I would have died happy. I strongly recommend it."}
{"text":"These guys were on campus (UNLV) yesterday.  I ordered a shrimp plate which was soooo freakin' delicious.  My only issue was the small amount of house sauce that I got.  I mean the little container had maybe 2 teaspoons in it which was barely enough for a third of my plate.  They could have at least filled the container with sauce.  Other than that, the dish was very flavorful with ample shrimp."}
{"text":"Wow! Absolutely amazing food for a reasonable price! Thank you for coming to punk rock bowling, you guys are amazing! The Japanese Burrito and the Chicken Plate were both perfectly done! Great job guys!"}
{"text":"The ribeye Japanese burrito is THE BOMB. I'm normally really picky with vegetables, unless they compliment the flavors and oh mannnn, every single bite of this burrito was so good. The ribeye itself was perfectly tender. I can't wait to have another burrito from them."}
{"text":"Had to give 3 stars since the rice was sorta hard and tasted old. Sucks. I do have to give mad props to the ribeye. It was delicious and tender. The sauce wasn't too bad either.

I'd definitely try it again, just in hopes that the rice is a bit more fresh. 

I'll try the burrito next time."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! I've had the combo plates which are great but I  especially love the Rib eye Burrito.  Everyone needs to try it and dip it in their house made sauces, it's soooo good! It makes me want one right now as I am typing this. Great food, great service. You're missing out if you don't go try them. My favorite food truck in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Apparently just having a food truck is, in and of itself, virtue enough. No need to serve high end food, just having a grill on wheels. Mobile food is where it's at, amirite?

This is about as phoned in of a representation of Japanese food as I've seen. The wraps are \"Japanese burritos\", which means about half of the food you get in a plate stuffed into a shell. The \"Mas\" hot sauce is awful and the teriyaki not much further behind. Rice is not so hot and none of the cups seem to fit well, so sure, spill that sauce all over yourself. What the Hell, it's Vegas, right? All the extra expense is because it's so cool and all...

So, if overcooked ribeye and vegetables predominantly high in onions, yet without any actual cooking technique, are your thing, here you go. Look no further."}
{"text":"I was looking for  something different to eat at other than Lucky's and spotted this food truck outside the LVCC during CES. The menu looked interesting and I decided to give the ribeye burrito($13) a try.

They have rice plates with your choice of beef, shrimp, or chicken that comes w/ fried rice and veggies. You can also roll any of those up into a burrito for a couple dollars less. Even though I enjoyed my burrito, the meat to rice ratio was 1:4 and after a couple bites of getting just mouthfuls of rice, I tore the burrito apart and finished it with a fork. The sauce they put in it is a creamy, savory sauce that really made the burrito. Also grab the hot sauce for a little kick!

Next time, I'll probably try one of the plates since they seem to have more meat!"}
{"text":"I have to admit - I was a little bit nervous about shrimp from a food truck. Boy oh boy was I wrong! Yesterday I got the shrimp teriyaki plate (served with veggies and fried rice). The shrimp was nothing less than delectable - perfectly cooked, plump and delicious. The fried rice and veggies likewise had amazing flavor. I will definitely order from this truck again.


Also, they have a really interesting sounding Asian burrito with similar ingredients that i really want to try..."}
{"text":"Hot, fresh, deliciousness! So tasty, and I was glad the Truk was stopping by the Government Center on a Friday to cheer up the government workers!
I chose the chicken bowl instead of the burrito. 
The chicken plate is very flavorful, and is a pretty good sized portion. I do enjoy a spicy kick to my food, and this meal was just spicy enough! 
There was enough meat in the chicken plate, and the veggies were pretty good too.  There were about 5 customers waiting to pick up food, and my wait was about 10 minutes. I'd rate their food better than most trucks that I've ordered from! Credit cards are accepted also."}
{"text":"Had Truk N Yaki for the first time and was highly impressed compared to many other food trucks I have eaten from. Francisco really gets great flavor from his ingredients and cooking talent! He also had a very nice young woman working with him and our whole group of people enjoyed the food. If there was a line of food trucks in front of me, I would choose Truk N Yaki for sure! Thanks!"}
