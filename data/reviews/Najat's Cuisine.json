{"text":"Went to the Sewickley location for a sit-down dinner.  Seems like it's geared towards takeout, as the restaurant is dominated by a large cooler display unit.  The tables are patio furniture covered with vinyl tablecloths, the lighting is way too harsh, and there's little ambiance.  The waitress informed us that they were out of many items on the menu, as they cook most of the food at another location.  Our order of spinach pie was partially frozen in the center and the dough chewy.  The falafel were unremarkable.  And I've had better sleek at most Middle Eastern restaurants in the area.  At least the baklava was decent.

I stopped by again to give them another chance and pick up some simple take-out food.  But they were closed at 3PM on a Saturday afternoon (with a hand-written sign saying \"reopening at 5PM\").  Hopefully they'll get their act together soon."}
{"text":"Najat is a very welcoming environment for all your friends and family. The true ethnic food is amazing to die for. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I am so glad I tried Najat's Cuisine!  I first heard of them last year when they had a small booth at Sewickley Public Library's Savoring Sewickley event, and heard they were opening their Sewickley location restaurant sometime in early 2018.   With so many delicious choices to pick from, my friend and I decided on the appetizer platter which had about eight different items.  The platter was $30, which at first glance seemed high for appetizers, but it was a great variety of food and was enough to split for our dinner.   I'm not vegetarian, however, everything we had that night was, and we loved every bite!  Some of my favorite items were the Tabouleh (parsley/lemons), Sleek (chickpeas & spinach) and M-Jaddarah (lentils).  All of the ingredients are so fresh and the flavor combinations are amazing... I just liked to mix everything together on my plate and dip the pita bread.  I can't wait to go back with a bottle of wine, (it's BYOB,)  and sit outside.  They have an adorable outdoor patio with a garage door that opens up.   I wish them all the best and hope they do a great business!"}
{"text":"Just what Sewickley needed.  Najat's has fantastic food, great service, and a wonderful atmosphere.  

We had the falafel, hummus with walnuts and cranberry, and cheese pie.  Najat, who was floating around the restaurant, makes everything by hand.  The cheese pie was pillowy soft and absolutely delicious.  

The owners and staff were beyond friendly: My girls wanted to dance and Henry, the owner, turned up the music and came out and danced with us.

This is an absolute must-try.  And don't forget to finish your meal with a Lebanese coffee."}
{"text":"I have been following Najat from place to place for years. I used to get their Bazenjani at the market next to Bar Marco before it was Bar Marco. Then, she was in the Pittsburgh Public Market. Then, I found her again at the Sewickley Market, and now she has this wonderful market/restaurant right by my house!!! 

I am so excited!

We went here during their soft opening and had the sampler. Everything is made with so much love and care that you can actually taste it! My favorites are the Bazenjani (please forgive any misspellings), plain Baba, and Muhamarrah, but everything I have had from them is excellent. 

Give this place a try. I have already been back 3 more times and their grand opening was only 2 days ago."}
{"text":"I was so excited to see that we were getting some middle eastern cuisine here in Sewickley, and when I visited, I was not disappointed!  This little place tucked away off Beaver is small, friendly and family owned.  The meat pie was delicious on my first visit, and when I made my second trip yesterday with my daughter, we shared the appetizer medley which was outstanding!  Their hummus is bright, smooth and delicious; the baba ghanoush has an underlying smokiness that makes it a standout.  I also loved the green beans, the tabbouleh, warm pita and lentils.  The atmosphere is casual and they do takeout (yay!) - I'll be back!"}
{"text":"They offer 16 vegetarian meals, 10 pies , 11 meat dishes, multiple dishes with hummus and eight mouthwatering desserts. This is the real deal authentic Lebonese food. We were fortunate to have a special half inch steak which we agreed with the chef to have it cooked his way and it was delicious and tender and tasty. The mashed potatoes were some of the best I've ever tasted. We had a salad called Fattouch and it was different and refreshing and delicious. The service was fantastic. They are just starting out and I hope everyone can try this delicious food."}
{"text":"This my new Lebanese restaurant, very nice owners and delicious food. Old style recipes passed down through generations."}
{"text":"Went for their supposedly grand opening and checked the hours of operation just to be sure. Hours of operation were noon-9pm. I drove my family all the way from the south hills @ 3:30pm to support a small business only to walk to the door to a sign saying they're closed until 4:30. A man opens the door just enough to yell out that they need a break, come back at 5:00. What a joke!!!! Never going back."}
{"text":"This is a great fast casual option in Sewickley!   It is very family friendly.  I like it for a healthy and delicious option on weeknights or it is a great family option for brunch on the weekends.  My kids loved their American options and my husband and I enjoyed their Lebanese breakfast.  The owners are gracious and hospitable.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Wow! What an amazingly fresh meal we had here!!! I cannot convey how delicious the hummus and tahini sauce were! Everything we had was good but these were something like I've never tasted and we eat a lot of hummus! We had the cilantro/garlic hummus and it made me feel like we were in Lebanon. Don't believe me? Try it. And I dare you to not lick the bowl! I found myself hoarding it from those we were eating with. My husband disappeared for 15 min when he went in to pay our bill (we ate on their outdoor patio) and I realized he was inside talking at length with the owners. No fancy atmosphere but this restaurant is all that is right w the world: the ability of a true heart to transform fresh ingredients into a delicious meal where you feel history in each bite!"}
{"text":"I don't feel I possess the proper vocabulary to convey how disturbingly delicious this place is.  

The owner was there and happy to answer all of my annoying questions.  Being a vegan is obnoxious and I almost die inside when venturing out to a new restaurant.  I figure whomever my questions are directed at is plotting my demise and making up answers.  Not here.  On to the food. 

GOOD GOD, YOU GUYS, RUN HERE AND EAT EVERYTHING.  The vegetable pie is filled with a plethora of vegetables encased in THE BEST SAVORY PASTRY THAT HAS EVER EXISTED.  

Real hummus in a handful of flavors to choose from.  The falafel sandwich had slightly too many onions for my taste, but that is such a minimal complaint it might not be worth mentioning.  Incredibly helpful owners, food that is straight up stupidly good, and something new in general...triple win."}
{"text":"This is a great family owned restaurant!  I found them at a local farmers market and once they had a brick and mortar, I was beyond eager to support!

The owners are open and willing to explain what's in each dish and even share there meal so you can try something without buying it. 

Must try!!!"}
