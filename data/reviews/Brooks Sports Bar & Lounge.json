{"text":"Visited this place today. .. wish we went somewhere else. My son's \"slidders\" were nothing but a flattened overcooked meatball which was too small even for the slider bun. When we brought this to our waitress attention she grabbed who I assume was the manager or owner. She was very proud and stood by how yes those are how these burgers are to look and the buns are ordered to fit these burgers. I could tell that she wasn't going to admit that the burger was swimming in the bun because it was so small and that it was clearly overcooked. She offered to take it back and bring me a large burger but I knew my son would be upset if his food was removed as he is not very verbal. The chicken lettuce wraps were a big dissapointment as my friend spit out her meat because it was burnt. The cook on the chicken was so inconsistent. Parts of it was fine but others were black. My mom's club sandwich was gross the bun was cold and moist as if it was frozen then thawed. The soho salad said it had fresh strawberries....well no strewberries, however there was boysenberries. Something that probably should have been brought to my attention as I don't really like those berries. The French fries and wings were good according to my eldest and my friends Cobb salad was very good. Waitress was new did not know the menu tho she was sweet. Kids menus were filthy with sticky sauce on it. Hardly no soap in the washroom.... the list goes on. I don't think I ever reviewed a restaurant before but felt I must. I think there was a reason it was so empty on a Friday at lunch time. When we walked in my son whispered to me saying \"mom is this place closed?\" Wow cricket cricket!"}

{"text":"Another restaurant in Bolton is going to come to a close soon with the kind of service we got today.  We went in Monday evening and no one came to seat us or even acknowledged or existence . Finally we left after 10 minutes went down the road to another restaurant.   They historically have served good food. ..but now the keyword is \"served\".  Would have been nice to try it again tonight but alas...we will have to frequent more reliable places in the future"}
{"text":"I came here on a late Sunday afternoon for dinner. I was waiting for ten minutes because I wanted to eat some food while watching some football, and I thought going to a sports restaurant would be the best place for that.  I spent 10-15 minutes at the door waiting for someone to seat me. No one was at the bar or the restaurant to help me. Finally someone came to seat me. I realized they had only one person serving the entire bar and restaurant.  The server herself was barely on the floor, and spent most of her time in the back. She would come out of the kitchen/back every fifteen to twenty minutes, and in between you were stuck without any service.  Onto the food, we ordered the grilled cheese burger as it sounded delicious. We got a side of Caesar salad as well. When the food came, the first thing we noticed was that there were no croutons on the salad. We asked and she said they've never served croutons on a Caesar salad. Ok. So just old lettuce and cheap Caesar dressing and it cost us extra to get that as a side.  Onto the burger itself. The meat was thin and dry and there was barely any sauce, if any. They said it would be built like a big Mac, but I don't understand in which way. It was poorly made and nothing like how we imagined it would be.  I understand it's only one item on the menu but the food and the service seemed representative of what this establishment has to offer."}
{"text":"Pure heaven if you're not counting calories..lol Had the fish tacos and churros for desert with one of their signature drinks.  Tacos were super delicious as the fish was crispy and the coleslaw had the perfect amount of tanginess.  The churros were filled with the most delicious dulce de leche I've tasted dusted with sugared cinnamon. (Came with 4 but I ate one before snapping a pic).  The float like drink wasn't overly sweet and had a kick to it.  Great service with a smile :) Cheers!"}
{"text":"This place is a pretty cool new sports bar in the Bolton area. Its got lots of TVs, specials and a big bar area. The food and service is OK. The burger was similar to quality I would expect from a Red Robins. The nachos portion was huge, was mostly just cheese and salsa -- not a lot of jalepenos or other toppings.   They do have a cool promo going on that for $13 you can get a pretty large Steam Whistle and keep the boot.   Overall, its another sports bar and I would come here for drinks after work again."}
{"text":"Really nice sports bar, TVs galore. They have daily specials. Clean, updated. We sat in the booths by the bar and they were a good size and very comfy.   My boyfriend ordered a whiskey float and we both enjoyed it. I got an apple martini and was a bit bothered that the drink was only 2/3 full.   We ordered a the Brooks appetizer sampler. The sweet chili siracha chicken wings were good, however everything else was over cooked &  overfried. The nachos were a little burned & larger than we expected.  Side note: when will restaurants learn that the baked nachos thing is gross and not palatable. Create a multi layer nacho dip and serve the nachos on the side.   Given that we visited after 9p, and the clientele count was low, you'd think the chefs in the back would be less distracted and food wouldn't be overcooked. Sadly, we weren't so lucky."}
{"text":"I don't understand why more people haven't visited this restaurant. I popped in for lunch and I was pleasantly surprised. The venue is beautifully renovated with countless screens and constant sports streaming. The food was excellent; I had the \"Waistline Burger\", a light turkey burger with tzatziki sauce. The service was great. The price was right ($10+tax for my whole meal). They even burned the logo of the restaurant onto my bun - a great way to display attention to detail.   Go here, you won't be disappointed. This place is a gem and Bolton doesn't have very many of those."}
{"text":"The food was good. I sat at the bar and the service was excellent.   Waking distance from the Hampton lnn. It doesn't show up as VA restaurant in yelp. I almost missed it"}
{"text":"So I was in Bolton visiting a friend when we decided to go for a bite to eat and a brew !  So we chose this local sports bar restaurant for a nice little meet up !  Place was dead empty which made service prompt . Food wise they had your basic sports bar choices and then some ....I got the calamari which was decent and some onion rings which I enjoyed ! My buddy got a steak sandwich which he said was tasty ! They have some great bar shot specials and good lunch value menu !!"}
