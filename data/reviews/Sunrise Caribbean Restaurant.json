{"text":"Managment should be ashamed.  Absolutely the WORST service in Scarborough.  The women who cash/handle your food wear there attitudes on there faces.  Be prepared to hear a disgusting smart mouthed attitude comment or whisper under breath from which ever cashier who decides they'd like to take your order."}
{"text":"Driving along the 401 east late in the evening the other night  on the way home and heard my belly grumble....boy do I feel like a oxtail/fried chicken combo from Sunrise.  I have been to many of there locations and the taste is similiar but portions vary.   Interesting story with them being the first caribbean restaurant in Canada with a drive through.  They started with one location on Kingston Rd. in Scarborough and now have grown to 14 locations around the GTA and southern Ontario....great small business story. Anyways...back to the food.  I think this is one of there franchise locations as per there website. Entered the restaurant, very clean, nice tunes playing the background.  I think its' the owner as I've seen her there a couple times greets with this bright and \"haven't seen you in awhile\" smile...I could have hugged her.  Ordered up my food plus wifeys and a couple dumpling for the kids and in no time I was munching on a dumpling and driving home waiting to sink my teeth into some tender oxtail.  By the way, owner gave me a free cup full of the soup of the day when I was waiting ...delicious! Got home, settled down at the kitchen table to gorge myself on this feast I have been dreaming about, and what do you know, they forgot my fried chicken!!! Big let down! I usually make a point of checking my take out order before leaving a restaurant but I guess my stomach played some jedi mind tricks on me and I got distracted.   Food that I did get was on par but wish they would have remembered the fried chicken. Will go back...but check order before leaving...lesson learned."}
{"text":"Place is dirty and food is highly unsatisfying.  Staff was rude and obnoxious."}
{"text":"Honestly, the food here is very bland. The rice and peas is nothing more than exactly that.. Rice and peas. No spice or flavour of coconut milk to it.   The chicken flavour was bland (I had the jerk chicken), and was given an extra piece of chicken in lieu of cole slaw. To be honest, I would've preferred the cole slaw instead.  The gravy was sweet. I've never had jerk chicken that was on the sweet side, but I was very unimpressed. I was happy to hear a jerk chicken place so close to home, but after my experience, I won't be returning.   Not to mention the customer service was extremely disappointing. I was in line, and the server addressed the African-American patrons behind me before dealing with me first. I couldn't believe it in this day and age. I'll never return after this experience, nor will I visit any other locations."}
{"text":"The food here is great especially the oxtail and Jerk Chicken. The staff are absolutely rude which will keep me away from here. Unfortunate as it could be a great place to frequent but with those attitudes who wants to go there and be talked shit about right in front of you after you order your food. If you call them out on talking about they automatically jump to accusing you of being racist. Bunch of hurting losers if you ask me."}
{"text":"This is what you get for a large $15 oxtail and bad service is complimentary. The women that work there need an attitude adjustment. Dare I say racist? Just observe their behavior with their \"own people\" versus \"outsiders\" that frequent this restaurant."}
{"text":"Overall good, however only tried the oxtail. Liked the packaging and presentation, disliked that they dont have a larger window where they serve food infrount of you (presentation)."}
{"text":"This place ain't half bad if you're craving for a quick Caribbean cuisine fix.  At this particular location (I've been to a couple), the gentlemen who helped me were courteous.  I was craving for some patties so I was recommended their Jerk Chicken patty as well as their Jerk Pork (I think...I have a mild concussion....*confused look*) Patty.  One of the gentlemen asked if I wanted coco bread with it so I went ahead and ordered those as well. Because why not?! Plus, that's usually how I eat my patties.    The patties were a little larger than your average patty.  Fillings were delicious and the amount were also generous.  The pastry was also nice and flaky.  As for the coco bread, it was a little too dense to my liking so after a few bites, I just tossed it.  Too bad though because the size of their coco bread was also quite generous.  I just personally prefer mine to be a little lighter and fluffier.    I'd rate the patties 5/5 and the coco bread 3/5.  With that being said, though, I'd go back there for a quick patty fix.    At another location, I have tried their Oxtail which is absolutely delicious!  Another great fix if you're hankering for some. 5/5.   Also tried their fried dumplings before and those too are quite good.  I'm a huge fan of the fried dumplings served at The Real Jerk and this one definitely is pretty close to par.  It has enough density in it without it being too heavy, and still have that nice fluffy inside. 4/5."}
{"text":"Good place for food the workers just have no respect always wanna talk back they always Ina rush"}
{"text":"I got the chicken curry with roti...not impressed. I won't be going back, my dad makes better curry! I paid about $7 and the serving was big which is a plus. The woman at the front desk was friendly enough!"}
{"text":"It's like a McDonald's for Caribbean food... Caribbean food can not be bootleg, and this is just plan, go somewhere else. You will get a more affordable price for better quality."}
{"text":"This place tries to rip you off. They have a jerk chicken special for $5 with rice and dark meat -- then they have the regular jerk chicken dinner for $8.50 and the only difference is that they give u more rice and and a small side of coleslaw! Same amount of chicken!! If you're willing to shell out an extra $3.50 plus tax for some rice and coleslaw then this is for u. Otherwise stick w the special. Their food is tasty enough but definitely there are better Caribbean restaurants in the area!"}
{"text":"This place used to be decent but I think we're done with it after tonight. The service has always been so-so but the food made up for it but they've been slipping for the past few years and this evening - it was the final straw.   We ordered two large oxtails to go - and all they came with were a pathetic 4 1/2 pieces of oxtail each on a medium bed of rice and peas. No coleslaw - that would be $3 extra we were told! Wha??? Grand total? $30!!! At that price we have much more plentiful options I'm sorry. This is ridiculous.   I think that's it for us - unless something changes."}
{"text":"Food is average.not the greatest Jamaican food. It's not authentic style,so if authentic is what you're looking for don't waste your money here, it has more of a fast food kind of taste and feel to it. It's ok but there's definitely other  real authentic Jamaican restaurants and take spots that destroy sunrise. Just being honest. Coming from a real Jamaican."}
{"text":"Been here 4 times in the past 2 months almost always get the family meal... 8 pieces of chicken, rice, salad, grave and a 2L of pop...  3 times they messed up my ordered..  I work near here so it a quick grab and go for my families dinner.  I done with this place, I watched the older thin woman working the counter be incredible rude to a guy who simply asked for his curry grave on the side.  Then my order was missing the salad and grave... Yeah I just paid nearly $30 and 1/3 of my order isn't here..  Food is good but service is horrible and you will be lucky if they give you the right items."}
{"text":"Delicious jerk chicken!!! Highly recommend this place. This is my go to place. Love it"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant for their Breakfast. I usually order the Ackee & Salt fish with cooked food ( Boiled Banana, Dumpling and yam). I also recommend their peanut porridge it comes with breakfast for less than $7 and really makes this meal worth my drive from downtown. Staff are not always the most pleasant. That could've gained them another star."}
{"text":"Their food tastes good but I noticed they seem to run out of roti shells at night. Their curry goat is so boney I am surprised it cost so much as your getting mostly bones. Other places have boneless goat for the same price. The staff here is always nice though."}
{"text":"They make an amazing curry goat dinner. VERY tasty and tender. I got the\"value meal\" size and that was quite filling and satisfying for only$8.99. I liked it so much I came back 2 days in a row. The staff was friendly. I will be back time and time again. This locations food is so much better than the Jane & Finch location."}
{"text":"Ok sunrise used to be our regular spot good food until we went to order oxtail with rice and peas and they said it's 18$thats right you heard me 18 fuckin dollars never again they are cut off what a sin greed has tooken over disgusting we told all our friends and they will not go back also,for nothing.oh yeah that was 18$each."}
{"text":"The food was good, but they opened a little late which hurt me because I was trying to catch a flight back to Chicago. The young ladies were not personable at all. Maybe it was too early on a Sunday morning for them to be bothered..."}
{"text":"This rating is for the Sheppard Ave E location. The food was absolutely nasty. SMH. I had to give my food to my dogs. Like, my goodness. The food taste like they threw sugar all up in it and only God knows what else. SMH. My belly is hurting. We are never ever eating here again. I had Oxtail. I'll stick to my original spot by Eglinton and Danforth in that plaza. SMH. You guys should be ashamed to be serving people that garbage and calling it food. I'm not a rude person but I'm more than upset. I mean I love me my caribbean food but yall need to just close down and done. No wonder some of the other locations closed down because you guys can't cook. Either hire a better chef or just stop serving people this nastiness. I'm more than upset today and everything is now close so I can't even get a nice meal."}
{"text":"This place was ok. Nice that they give you the food in cardboard boxes as opposed to styrofoam, so I thought that was pretty good. I got the lunch special jerk chicken with rice and peas. Rice was nice and the jerk chicken was alright, good price but I've had better. I've also had the dumplings here and they're pretty good."}
{"text":"Was really craving some Jamaican food. Went here and lady said there's no rice ready and it would be 10 minute wait. Also, out of their entire menu, the only food available was the chicken (fried, bbq or jerk), dumplings and chicken soup. This was 2 and a half hours before closing time. The chicken was dry and chewy. I don't understand how this establishment stays open."}
{"text":"We ordered fish, rice and peas, plantain, veggies and dumplings.  We were told the fish was snapper.  It clearly was not.  The rice and peas was clumpy / sticky (i.e. not prepared properly by a Jamaican).  The plantain was supposedly cooked while we were in the building.  This appeared to be an outright lie.  We never received the dumplings.  It is not that difficult to prepare and serve excellent Jamaican food.  The ingredients are 1 Jamaican cook and 1 knowledgeable server.  I wonder why such ingredients would not be available on a Friday evening."}
{"text":"Sunrise never disappoints at any location Ive gone to (Brampton and Lakeshore location which has now closed). Authentic Jerk Chicken, Curry Goat, and Oxtail. Generous portions and always fast service. Love me my Ting & Pinapple Juice with my meals. Brings me back to Jamaica everytime."}
{"text":"Delicious comfort food! We had the ox tail on rice/beans and jerked chicken on rice/bean with a side order of fried chicken. It was delicious and nothing compares. Looking for to try their fried dumplings."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite to eat and grabbed the jerk chicken. It was a generous portion for less than 10 dollars but it wasn't my favourite meal. I got some chicken served on top of a bed of rice along with some sauce.  The chicken was nice, but it was mainly bones and not a lot of meat. However, it was cut up in front of me and served hot. There was way more rice than meat. I love rice but the balance of rice to meat made me stop loving my rice before I was done. The whole meal was a little dry, like to had been on the warmers in the store for a little too long.   A few previous reviews have mentioned bad customer service, and the manager has posted a reply on Yelp. I just wanted to say that the young man that served me was very friendly and helpful. Props to him.   Overall, tasty chicken, but too dry and not enough meat. I didn't mind the meal I ate, but probably won't be back."}
{"text":"This location has moved to North York Sheridan mall on Wilson Ave. Given the area, and competition the prices for the amount of food at this location is expensive.  Food is decent--so far I have only tried the kingfish, rice & peas, coleslaw and cabbage.  Coleslaw is an odd consistency slightly pureed? strange but is nicely flavored.  Fish was not too greasy and well seasoned.  Rice & peas were average.  I did enjoy the sauteed cabbage--it added a nice crunch to the rice.  I rate them down for portion sizes and prices.   Location is huge with lots of seating but on my occasions there it hasn't been very busy--perhaps most people get take out.  Staff are typical for a Caribbean establishment which means they have very limited customer service skills--I will leave it at that."}
{"text":"Chicken and rice were dry. I read the goog reviews afterwards. Everyone's rating is 1. The girl working behind the counter was rude. Like she was doing me a favor by ordering. I was craving Jamaican after a long time. After very long I order this and this is what happened. Is the owner aware of the ratings. Who is the owner? The employee was complaining about her hours and she was upset that she is getting 30hrs. Get rid of the bad employees geez. They bringing the sales down. Get it?"}
{"text":"Today I ordered the jerk chicken wrap which was not bad I must say.  I love Jamaican style food and although this isn't really it, it was enough to get me interested to come back for breakfast.  I'd give the wrap  a 3.5 out of 5. It was big and kinda messy to eat but tasty nonetheless.  Hind sight shoulda ordered the fried chicken and dumpling soup.    Stay away from the coleslaw on a hot day.  I almost puked it up.  Rancid and bad from the heat or something.  Just gross.  But yeah, I will come back."}
{"text":"Food was alright here. Even though I did not get the boneless jerk chicken, their chicken curry was not bad.  Yet the guy who took our order acted so unwelcoming, to a point we felt uncomfortable. Also their restroom was not clean either.  It is cool that they have breakfast and a daily special menu but the service turned me off big time. Don't feel like coming back, at least not to this location."}
{"text":"Small place but the service was excellent! The food was amazing as well, wanted to try everything on the menu. So tempting! This time, I ordered the Jerk chicken with their rice , covered with goat curry sauce. AMAZING! It tastes home-made. I also had a side order of the Plantains. Definately a place to go, to grab Caribbean food. Limited places to sit and eat, more of a take-out spot but soo worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised with their curry goat, staff was pretty rude but I'm used to that as I live in the area, everyone is generally rude and ill mannered. Service was really slow considering I was the only one there, which attributes to their poor service and disregard for hungry customers. Decent curry compared to what is offered in the area but not a place I would recommend."}
{"text":"I admit I had written off Sunrise after their atrocious appearance in Barrie. If that wasn't  a hot mess I don't know what was.  However, hunger took over recently and I tried the Jane/Finch store. It was busy and I see why:) the food is divine. I had The Jerk chicken and it was delicious. Every bite was flavourful with a hint of crispiness. The rest of my family members had barbecue chicken, curried goat and oxtail. No complaints. A Special 'shout out' to the rice and peas. It was fresh and delectably AMAZING! Man I could just eat that all by itself. dumplings- soft and flaky, that can rival the best international pastry chef. Sunrise you've really stepped it up by serving authentic and delectable Jamaican food. Not to mention the service. We all know many Jamaican restaurants often have 'screw face' servers :)  ( there ain't no smiles  with that)  However, your staff was friendly and helpful. It was nice to see. Thank you. You have a new raving fan!"}
{"text":"Usually when you think of a franchise you think it wont be very authentic and not very good.  I'm had my fair share of food from the Caribbean and Sunrise surprisingly is right up there with the mom and pop shops.  I used to avoid going to Sunrise for the sole fact that it was a franchise and I didn't want to be disappointed compared to what i'm used to.  I ordered the stew chicken.  I wish there was more meat they were a bit stingy on the meat portion but I got a whole lot of rice and peas.  After I saw the portion of meat i purchased a piece of their fried chicken to give it a try.  Ill be honest it had to be one of the better fried chicken I have ever had.  Seeing as my local Jamaican mom and pop shop closed down recently Sunrise will be my go to place for all my Caribbean food cravings and i wish to stay local.  Give it a try everyone I don't think you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"The portion sizes, good lord the portion sizes!!! The food is fine but if you planned on eating anything larger than a sample size, FORGET IT!"}
{"text":"This place was atrocious through uber eats. I placed an order and it was confirmed but never made its way to me. So I phoned in and the gentleman told me the order somehow got cancelled on their end. Having waited 15 minutes already they didn't even have the courtesy to call and let me know.   Fine, so I placed the same order again through uber eats and called in to confirm the items of my order. Just to be sure.   The food finally arrives and most of the items I ordered were missing. I called back and they realized they forgot some items on the counter but did not offer to deliver the missing items. I called uber eats and uber eats offered for me to re-order those missing items without charge but I just wasn't feeling it. I had already lost my appetite by this time  Thanks, Sunrise for sure!"}
{"text":"I knew from trying it before that the goat with rice was amazing... But the dumplings are highly addictive.    Only complaint is that the menu displayed is somewhat of an eye sore."}
{"text":"Went here after having it for the first time since 3 years ago. My favourite is their stewed chicken. The food is rly good but the negative is the amount of rice to chicken ratio is off. I got abt 4 pcs of tiny chicken that was majority bone. For the price I'd have been happy w a bit heartier pcs of chicken to eat w my rice and peas."}
{"text":"In my travels to Jamaica outside of the all inclusive resorts where few people venture into but the cities this is a type of place that most Jamaicans eat it. An open kitchen lets you see the fresh food and it's relatively inexpensive.    Try the side orders of jerk chicken or the fried chicken. Generous side portions for only $4 four bucks and some change ($4.20).  The tastey flavours and freshness was outstanding. The sides are bit more ho hum  but overall a great place. Only drawback is this place is mainly it take out with only few stools. So if you ever in the Dixie and Rathburn area...don't miss it its right next to the beer store next to Rockwood mall."}
{"text":"Great spot for carribean food. They have the best jerk chicken in my opinion. Price is a little bit pricey but they give you large portion. Make sure you get the oxtail sauce with your rice, it tastes really good. One of the downside of the place is that they are slow at order even when they only have a few customers. I would give them five star if they take their order faster."}
{"text":"I love Sunrise but their customer service was horrible. The last time I went there they gave me attitude for no reason. The girl gave me the 2 smallest piece of chicken then I saw her try to give me another piece but the other lady beside her told her to put it back right in front of me. If I'm paying $10 for a meal I expect a nice piece of chicken or I would've got KFC instead. I gave it another chance but when I went there I had to wait 15 mins because the girl behind the counter was flirting with the customer so I just left. Everyone has a bad attitude towards their customers and its not worth the food. Also last time they forgot my drink. I showed them my receipt and they thought I was lying. If I could give this -1 stars I would !"}
{"text":"Good food to be sure, but the prices aren't great for the size of the portions, and the service is far, far from what it should be. I'd say I was even treated downright rudely on a visit or two. As a result we seldom go to Sunrise even when it's what we feel like. Are you listening, management???"}
{"text":"I really don't like sunrise restaurants. The food is never really that good and the worst part about it is that at every sunrise you go to the food always different, they don't have standardized recipes and they don't have any idea of consistency.   Picture going to McDonald's and having your Big mac taste different every time you go. would you really want to take a chance and go to McDonald's."}
{"text":"The jerk pork was basically just a belly of fat that still had hair on it. Disgusting. Not worth the money."}
{"text":"I went to this Sunrise location for the first time on February 5th, 2015. I would like to mention that I've had eaten at Sunrise locations in Brampton, and I would rate them five stars. The friend I travelled to Sunrise with yesterday and others have warned me about Sunrise - I was about to learn that I had been pampered by the Brampton locations.   At this Sunrise location, a friend went to get fried chicken and jerk chicken while I ordered oxtail. She placed an order for her and a friend, while I ordered for myself. As soon as I stepped to the side to let other people order, the workers completed forgot my order. My friend continued standing by the front, so they got her order together.   I'll discuss my friend's order first. She paid for herself first, and all went well.  When she tried to pay for her friend's order with his credit card, she realized that the lady at the cashier entered the wrong amount. The food was on special for approximately $7.20 - the cashier almost charged her $17.20, almost DOUBLE the special price. The woman didn't even have the courtesy to apologize for her mistake.   We both decided to order festival. My friend was asking me why they were so dark. I foolishly assumed it was because they cook it a little differently. Long story short, the festival was burnt, and would have been completely inedible without oxtail gravy.   I thought about opening my oxtail to look at it, but then decided to open it when we got back to the office - BIG MISTAKE. I had asked them for no rice, just oxtail, in a regular container. There were no vegetables and there was barely enough oxtail to cover the bottom of the container. I might as well as have just taken the small container, instead of paying how much money for a spoonful of oxtail.   I also ordered carrot juice there from the brand \"Real Deal.\" It was edible, but it was horrid.  The closest thing I can describe the taste to is baby carrot mush or carrot soup. No amount of shaking could save this drink. I drank it, as carrot juice can be expensive, but the experience was awful While I can't entirely blame a restaurant for the drinks it carries, there is some responsibility here. While they did not make the drink, housing it in your restaurant signifies your endorsement and promotion of the brand. I was expecting real carrot juice, not glorified sewage.   I hate writing negative reviews, but this experience has sincerely vexed my spirit. I am so not impressed. I am all for supporting black-owned establishments, but I will not do so if I have to endure poor quality service. This is the 21st century: it's time to do better.  If you are in the Dixie/Eglington area and you are craving Caribbean food, Shandra's Roti Shop is a great place to be. I'm sure Google can offer better alternatives as well. I implore everyone reading this post, kindly do not buy food at Sunrise's Rockwood Mall location."}
{"text":"Friendly service... can't go wrong with Jerk chicken with sweet plantains... Will definitely be back..."}
{"text":"I love Caribbean food but was disappointed with a few things here.   1. I though the Curry Chicken was just a bit on the salty side.   2. They don't have hot sauce at least that what they told me. My food sure needed it.   Either they were to lazy or just did not want to please a customer. Sad a Caribbean restaurant with no hot sauce. Come on man !   Somebody needs to tell them people expect to be able to spice it up.   3. My to go bag did not have plastic utensils.   No thanks I'll pass on the next visit. Oh don't expect friendly service either."}
{"text":"Food is decent but portions are kid sized.  if you're an adult expect to buy 3 meals instead of one.  EXPENSIVE!  go to Red Snapper or Patois for better prices and portions.  now where to really sit.  tv is an old CRT.  they care more about money in their pockets than pleasing customers.  I give this chain another year or two.  You can't stay open while charging these prices.  Go to Maimana a couple doors down for an amazing meal."}
{"text":"Staff are rude and generally seem annoyed that you're even there. They go at the slowest pace possible just because \"they can and you can't do nothing about it\". Food is generally OK but nothing special. Customer service is terrible, it doesn't matter if your from the Caribbean or China, they hate all customers. Makes me mad!"}
{"text":"Food is good. But the staff are extremely rude. This is a common theme with this place"}
{"text":"Visited Toronto for the US memorial wknd 2017.  Found this place on yelp,  the food was GREAT. Even though they didn't have any lunch/dinner at 11:18 on a Sunday.  The Ackerman and salt fish was on point, however.... di \"fry dumpling\" was more the consistency and taste of a donut. Which, didn't take away from the quality of the food an' di service."}
{"text":"I've been to the other Sunrise Caribbean locations before and I have to say I wasn't a fan... however this brand new location surely changed my mind.   I come here about every other week. The staff are friendly and personable, it's always clean and the food is always fresh! Even the dumplings, festivals and plantains... mmmmm.... So fresh and yummy!  They also have daily lunch specials that are $5.35 each. I always get the stew chicken with rice and peas... its my fav, however their oxtail is pretty darn good as well! They also have a \"Soup Value Deal\".... which includes chicken soup (Jamaican chicken soup with potatoes, carrots and dumpling... yum!) and a fried dumpling on the side... I believe its around $2.50 and its pretty filling even for lunch!   All in all this is an awesome location that is hidden behind the pizza hut in the plaza at the corner of hurontario and eglinton. If you're a fan of caribbean cuisine, you have to try this place out! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Have jerk chicken with rice and peas, get it with oxtail gravy and let the coleslaw melt into the rice & gravy. It's unbelievably good. It reminds me of a perfect teenhood.  I might be biased but I remember Sunrise when they were across the street in the plaza. That's before they took over the Wendy's. The storefront was about 10' wide and the windows were completely fogged all winter. Without a doubt, this is the standard I hold all jerk to."}
{"text":"There has been a recent update to their menu. First off the menu board has completely changed. Secondly, there is no longer a small and large option; now its just a regular size option. Thirdly, when you order for take-out it is no longer packed in a Styrofoam container but now its packed in a cardboard box with their sunrise logo on it. In the end I think the changes were for the better. For not even a dollar more you get larger portions since the small and large sizes are no longer available. Nothing has changed with the food."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, but the woman behind the counter was soooooo rude I couldn't believe it!!!"}
{"text":"Decide to try a Caribbean restaurant while in Canada needless to say i was starving that day.  My favorite Oxtail was on the menu so i had that it tasted so good i felt like i inhaled the meal. Will i go back, definitely.  If I'm ever in Canada again i know where I'm getting my oxtail from."}
{"text":"Slow, slow service. After the century-long wait, I got home only to discover they forgot to put in the slaw and baked dumpling I ordered with my main....Good food, poor to mediocre customer service. Would have gotten a higher rating if they actually gave me ALL of what I ordered."}
{"text":"Yummy affordable jamician food...this place is a hidden gem with deliciously killer spicy jerk chicken and savoring oxtail...its a pretty small place, but its really clean inside. They had a variety of caribbean delites from fried chicken, fish, lamb, oxtail and beef. Its too bad this place didnt have patties because I was craving for it. The portions are pretty big too. Will definietly come back to this place"}
{"text":"OMG!!!! If I could give it 10 stars I would!!!! amazing food!!! I love it! I am officially hooked! I wish I could eat there everyday! must try this food!!!"}
{"text":"Nothing but goodness here chicken was off the hook and the goat head soup was on point never had better ... great service and food loved it"}
{"text":"The best chicken roti I have ever had. I like how saucy the chicken curry is, not dry at all. And the roti is just right. What I really like about this place is they have different things then most roti shops. I always like to try new things and when ever I order from there I add on something new. I really like there buns. Their staff could be more friendly but they aren't so bad that it makes you not want to go back."}
{"text":"After my disappointing lunch today (NOT at Sunrise - somewhere else), I begged Spouse to drive me to Sunrise Caribbean in the Sheridan Mall.  Had not been there for almost 3 years, if not more.  THEY HAVE KEPT THEIR STANDARDS AND THE FOOD is STILL AS DELISH AS EVER.  Had the daal puri roti with goat curry - one is HUGE and enough for two people.  Also ordered small goat curry with peas and rice (with added hot sauce), and two triangular shaped pineapple sweet pastries.  The daal puri roti was smooth like silk and very tasty.  Total:  less than $20!!! The food had massive amounts of FLAVOUR.  Mmmm, still lingering on my tongue.  Service is friendly and polite.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Ended up in Scarborough this past Sunday so had to get my fix of Caribbean food and decided to get take-out from Sunrise as their jerk chicken never disappoints.  The spot is extremely casual and the woman behind the counter was friendly and packed up my order to go.    I ordered the jerk chicken dinner (quarter chicken dark meat) with rice and peas with oxtail gravy, and the dinner comes with a small side of cole slaw.  When I first discovered Sunrise years ago before it became a chain with several locations, their cole slaw was delicious and stood out from the rest of the restaurants.  The cole slaw has changed with their expansion but nonetheless still creamy and good.  I also bought an order of just oxtail.  There is only one size and the styrofoam container was filled to the brim; it tasted great.  Unfortunately,  I  have yet to discover a great Jamaican spot close to me downtown so I had to order the oxtail despite the cost of $11.  Satisfied my craving.    I have always returned to Sunrise for take-out and my fix of Jamaican take-out over the years.  It may not be the best, most authentic Jamaican food, but overall I am always satisfied when in need of comforting Jamaican food, which I rarely can get."}
{"text":"Food is okay. They had only one curry when I got there and only plain rice. The staff is a bit rude, but when I'm hankering for some curry goat or Jerk chicken while I'm at work then it definitely kills the craving."}
{"text":"There's nothing particularly wrong with the food here, I just find it falls relatively short in most aspects. From a value standpoint, Sunrise is relatively stingy with portion size and disguises meals by adding unreasonably large amounts of rice. The jerk chicken leans towards the over-salted side of things and the rice is pretty bland. The authenticity factor is also something that didn't stand out to me, feels like a pretty gentrified chain and lacks the real cultural connection. The service quality isn't terrible, but things move pretty slowly and I wouldn't expect any superfluous pleasantries."}
{"text":"Stopped coming there for a couple of years due to bad service from the staff. Decided to give them another try and for several months everything was fine. I ordered and paid for the oxtail and rice and peas which has always been my favorite there. The server prepared my meal but I thought he did not put enough gravy so I asked for a little extra gravy. He looked at me either with indifference or annoyance, I couldn't be sure, then told me there is an extra charge for more gravy. The bottom line is that I will not be going there anymore. P.S. A good friend of mine stopped going there a couple of years ago because of the disrespectful service. I have tried many times to get him to give them another chance. Now I feel foolish and he has the last laugh on me."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place.  I always get a little edgy just because I know I'm different when I walk into restaurants like this one - which obviously caters to a specific ethnicity/culture - that I am not a part of.    However, the service was excellent.  The cashier apologized that I had to wait for a minute while she went to the back to talk to her colleagues about the storefront running out of bread.  She was super well-knowledged about the menu and ordering was easy (even when you don't know what comes with what - she'll just guide you through the process).    Ordering was a success.  When it came to pick up my order, I was looking at all the business cards/flyers on the side of the restaurant and another employee had to call for my attention.  I thought this girl looked a little annoyed but she piled on the ox tail on top of my rice then asked if I wanted more gravy?!  I thanked her but said no as my rice was already drowning in sauce.    I have 0 idea about the bad customer service as I do feel different when I walk in but the staff is one of the best I've encountered.   The oxtail was between tender and chewy and the sauce was savoury.  I love their cole saw and will always get a grace pop with my order.  Will definitely return to try their more of their menu."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Sunrise location. Being a franchises the food is good and consistent through all locations but this location stands out because of their service. They are friendly, welcoming and seem to actually enjoy their job. My family eats here often and the prices are reasonable. I love their fried dumplin tin he mornings. It is so fluffy."}
{"text":"This review is based on Toonie Tuesday at Sunrise Caribbean Restaurant.   I was so disappointed that I missed the Lunch Specials when I walked into Sunrise passed 3 pm. Not that I am crazy about eating Curry Mutton.. but I always looking for specials. But it was my lucky day!! It is Toonie Tuesday.. so I can now get either Jerk Chicken or Fry Chicken with rice and peas for $2.99 till 7pm. That's perfect!   I love dark meat though it has more fat content but it always turn out tender and juicy and harder to mess up... (even I cannot mess that up!) The whole chicken leg is juicy and spicy the way Jerk chicken suppose to me... and of course YES to gravy!   The deco is cafeteria like.. but the more primitive it is.. the more I feel like I am down at Jamaica.. even the lady that served me has a heavy Caribbean accent while I ordered my food with my Chinese accent... that's when cultures meet!"}
{"text":"Sunrise Caribbean Restaurant is located at Markham and Sheppard. Really convenient location close to 401...  Even though the place is quite new..it already has the run down vibe I guess to match other restaurants in the plaza?  I would suggest stick with lunch specials at $5 changes everyday which are much better deal than other combos or dinner menu.  Oxtail with Rice and Peas ($8.19) - pricey for the portion... great as a snack.. a pricey snack! - The oxtail was nice and tender.. and the sauce has this little spicy kick to it but  not overwhelming ...went so well with the rice and peas!  As a fast food place, my order took a litle while to get ready.   I still HUNGRY after eating that!! What should I have next?!!"}
{"text":"Staff here is terrible..not friendly at all. Quality of the food is not good like before"}
{"text":"(Mississauga location though) Oh my god, literally the BEST place!  I get the goat w/ rice and the only complaint I have is that when I go back to my leftovers, my mom's already eaten them! RUDE. Haha.  Amazing service here too"}

{"text":"What a great spot!!! This place just opened up a few weeks ago and lucky me it's so close to my work. I was on my way to Subway to get my regular BLT when I remembered it was there and decided to stop in and see what they had for lunch. They had many options that are the regular favs: oxtail, jerk chicken, bbq chicken, classic fried chicken, soup, rice and peas, dumplings and I could go on and on. I decided to go with the bbq chicken with rice and peas and a side of coleslaw. I'm glad I did it was soooo super yummy and took me back to the beaches in sunny Jamaica!! And to top it off the staff was very friendly and patient. The spot is quite spacious and they have a few tables for those who want to dine in. I was so excited to eat my meal that I think I ran back to my office! It was well worth it. I scraped the bottom of the box to make sure I ate it all!! I will definitely go back soon and I think everyone in the neighbourhood should visit."}
{"text":"This place was definitely better than the majority of the Jamaican spots I've been too in Atlanta,  but it didn't have that bomb flavor that I would expect . I had the jerk chicken which was good , the rice and peas was cooked perfectly and the coleslaw was good as well. Overall it gets a pass considering its a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Food is always good when I come here but this location in particular... Weston, was out of rice and peas and plantains. Service was OK."}
