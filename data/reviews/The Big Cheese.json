{"text":"Pricey, not a lot of service and very cheap in cheese. A real poutine have the same level of cheese than fries!"}
{"text":"The poutine is decent, it does the job when you crave heavy, soggy and cheesy fast food. 
We used a groupon this one time, not a deal at all. We didn't save any money - we inquired with the employees and they could not have been less helpful. They had no clue how to deal with customers, and came across as ignorant and uncaring. Really left us with a poor impression. Going to have to think twice before returning to this location."}
{"text":"Three stars on balance for the good variety of topping available, the mediocre gravy, and the flaccid fries. If you are non traditionalist, like chicken gravy, and aren't particular about the crispness of fries than this place is therefore right up your alley for a snack. Personally, I prefer crispy fries and beef gravy so it's not my cup of tea, and the hot dog we accompanied the fries with was not hot enough to begin to melt the shredded cheese topping, or soften up the tepid top sliced bun. I'd therefore recommend sticking to the fries if late night snacking, as the skeleton crew seems to have trouble being on point."}
{"text":"I purchased a Groupon for 2 canned drinks and 2 poutines, and was pleasantly surprised to find out that any 2 regular sized poutines could be selected with the exception of 2 flavours  (in the past, my friend told me only the Groupon only worked on the \"traditional\"). We tried the chicken peppercorn and beef taco poutine. Service was fast and friendly. There could have been more cheese but there were a lot of additional add-ons already so the flavour was all there. Taco poutine was the favourite of the 2. As a personal preference, I would have liked less gravy and crispier fries. The value when you use a Groupon is awesome - the poutines typically cost $9 to $10 each and I believe the Groupon is advertised at $16."}
{"text":"I love fries. I love cheese curds. I even love them together. This place offers some decent poutine with a variety of menu options-- it's hard to choose sometimes!

I appreciate the fact that they provide the option of gluten-free/veggie gravy. Everything is made fresh and to order, but I often find the takeout boxes they are served in can cause the fries go soft and mushy since it seals in the heat and steam. The poutine is still delicious, regardless."}
{"text":"Whether the food is good or not, if your restaurant closes twenty minutes before the posted time, you have no place complaining about a bad review.

If you close at 20.40, don't say you close at 21.00. It's not that hard."}
{"text":"Tried a big variety of their pettines! Favorite was buffalo chicken.

The sizes are really big so small is probably okay... even to share :)"}
{"text":"This is a spot that I know I shouldn't frequent, but when a craving for something satiating hits, the big cheese always hits the spot. I like the vegan gravy, it's spicier and more flavourful than the regular sauce and atleast they have a \"healthier\" option."}
{"text":"if I could give zero stars I would.  This review is based solely on customer service & honesty of the company.  We gifted a groupon to my parents (2 senior citizens) & the manager would not honour their valid groupon- after some debate & unnecessary humiliation to the customers they were turned away.  Please save your money & do not buy a groupon for this venue."}
{"text":"Not very cheesy...... Kinda skimped out on that for my order of large traditional poutine. Also the fries were not crispy enough. Obviously after gravy the top gets soggy but the bottom should be crisp for the first minute or so, didn't happen. Overall average - 1 for skimping out. Head over to the new Smoke's Poutinerie and check out some real good poutine."}
{"text":"They took 30 minutes to make 2 poutines. The place was incredibly filthy and the service was awful.
Go to the other location. Food is way better and its actually clean."}
{"text":"4 stars for marketing.  it's catchy, got wifi to attract customers.

3 stars for ambience/decor.

2 stars for food quality.

1 star for customer service, but not on me...the customer after me, she forgot his order after 15min. of waiting...just a sorry! poor fella.

Anyways ordered the Porky Pig: double  smoked bacon (not, barely any), italian sausage, mushrooms, onions and of course cheese, which were all in good proportions.  My main beef is the gravy, a bit salty, and not thick like back home.

Yet it's good enough for a repeat.  Solid 2.5 stars then."}
{"text":"Was running last minute errands picking up Christmas gifts and such before picking up kids from school and got hungry real fast. Saw The Big Cheese and decided a quick poutine on the go might hit the spot.

I entered as soon as they opened and placed my order. As I was waiting I noticed some of the tables were not really clean. I took my basic poutine to go and and noticed it was really cheesy. I couldn't find the curds like you usually can, it appeared the cheese they used all melted into the gravy. The gravy didn't offer a lot of flavour either The fries were just meh.

On the flipside they offer a ton of poutine options which is pretty cool and some of the flavour combinations might up the taste a bit.

While you may like this place, and it might be perfect after the bar food, I most likely won't return."}
{"text":"Used a Groupon here.  Looked through the menu and decided on the bombay bomber.  Chicken was moist, sauce was ok (not really butter chicken), onions were good.  Fries were decent and cheese curds were there, regular size was very filling for lunch.  Typically with poutine after you get through the first half loving it, you hit a wall and each bite gets harder to swallow and this was no different.  Not horrible, not spectacular, food came out very fast."}
{"text":"Okay so after a 3 course fine dining dinner, we hit up Kensington wine bar for a few glasses of wine and talked the night away with the ladies, it was late and a few of us were hungry.  The Big Cheese is just around the corner from where we were so we womened up in our high heels and treaded over.  When we arrived, the place was empty but there was smiling guy at the front ready to take our order.  Whenever I crave poutine, I always get the traditional, I don't like ruining the poutine with all the meat fixings and etc!  We decided to go with a large traditional poutine, small vegetarian version of the traditional poutine and the corn fritters.  We took a seat near the entrance in the corner and gradually late night drinkers streamed in for their poutine fix as we waited for our greasy goodness.  Our food was delivered right to our table and we each had a fork in hand ready to dig in BUT not before I snapped a quick pic :) I know I know, I'm THAT girl.

The Big Cheese uses locally grown yukon gold potatoes and authentic Quebec cheese curds with a tasty gravy.  At first bite, the poutine was just what I needed at that moment.  Salty, soaked in gravy with a curd to each bite!  They are quite generous with the cheese curds but I had wished that they were at least slightly melted but nonetheless it was good!  I tried the vegetarian poutine and found that it has so much more flavor than the traditional.....interesting!  There were 8 small corn fritters to an order and they were crispy, greasy and corny.  They were good but not as good as chicken on the way corn frits ;)  

All in all, the big cheese is definitely the place to hit up if you're craving some late night greasy food.  They have great hours : M-W 11:00am - 9:00pm, Thursday 11:00am - 11:00pm, F-S 11:00am - 3:30am and Sunday 11:00am - 9:00pm!  They offer many different types of poutines, beef, chicken, pork, veggie as well as yam fries, chili, hot dogs or you can even build your own!  Corn frits are on the menu and they've got a dessert poutine - fries tossed in cinnamon, brown sugar topped with cream cheese and caramel sauce *drool* I shall try that next time!  But for now, a perfect poutine for me is crispy crispy fries topped with loads of cheese curds and a thick hot gravy to finish while slightly melting the curds - I am still in the search for the best poutine....where you at poutine?"}
{"text":"Ordered the notorious P I G  was supposed to have spicy Italian sausage - came with a few pieces of breakfast sausage on top. Very chincy on the toppings. Quite the let down for $12. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I came in here to pick up an order and it took quite awhile before I got anyone to notice me, standing right at the counter.

The employees are a bit rough around the edges so to speak and not very inviting or warm.  The food was OK but I've had better poutine at Costco.  The gravy was a bit bland and the cheese was way too melted.

It probably would have been a 3 or 4 star experience if the person working at the counter wasn't putting up such a \"bad-ass\" attitude."}
