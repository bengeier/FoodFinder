{"text":"I am not a 5-star person.  I think everyone/everything has room for improvement.  But, Fenwick's?  They are spot-on, delicious every time.  

This is owned and operated by Catherine, of Catherine's on Providence for any old-time Charlottean.  She is a superb chef!  Her culinary and wine skills are some of the best in Charlotte.

This is not fine dining.  It is not fancy.  In fact, it is quirky and small and you often feel a little close to your dining neighbor.  

Must try:  Tomato Bisque Soup, it comes as a side option with their meals.  My hubbie says these are the best burgers in Charlotte... I am a veggie, and I beleive their grilled veggie burger is the best in town.  Their fries are great.  Sweet potato fries?  Delicious!  Tuna salad, with  melt-in-your-mouth croutons and an array of homemade dressings to choose from?  Pure yumminess.  My husband also adores the club sandwich.  Oh, and the muffins.  Delectable!

As creatures of habit, my order is always the same: Veggie burger, with cheese, side of soup and fruit.  And this is a 5-star meal delivered with 5-star service.  

Sit at the bar and get to know your neighbors!

Pretty tight for families with children... I don't bring my younger ones in here."}
{"text":"I would like to give 4.5 stars just because it is on the pricey side, but I will round up to 5 because if you are richer than me (likely) it won't matter as much. 

Came in the slow time between lunch and dinner, and had the place basically to myself. They had no problem accommodating me and my laptop, though didn't have any open outlets to charge. They gave me the wifi password, I ate a wonderful sandwich and onion rings, and the friendly, efficient waitress kept my glass full and floated over often enough to conversate (and make us feel like old friends) and take care of my random needs like more napkins, but not too often to distract or annoy. She did not rush me, even when the dinner crowd hit around 5:45 and they needed the table (very small place, limited seating for high demand, and difficult to find a parking spot during peak hours) but I am considerate and left when they got busy. I will come back at a similar time for the same purpose, but this is not a laptop place during peak hours (like you could get away with at Panera). I would want to try their brunch as it is supposed to be amazing, but cautious of the time I go. I doubt they could accommodate large parties, the biggest table I saw would seat 4 adults tightly. No TV that I saw. 

My meal, a sandwich with deluxuries like avocado and bacon, onion rings, and a soda was $15. It did seem to be all home made and was very good, though. My order was accurate and I can't complain about any of it. Just wish it was a few dollars cheaper!"}
{"text":"Super cute little restaurant with amazing food!! My mom and I had brunch here last week and loved all the unique breakfast options they had that it made it so hard to pick something.  I ended up getting a mimosa and bananas foster french toast, while my mom got the eggs benedict.  Both were amazing!! My french toast was perfect and had a delicious sauce on it and the eggs benedict was just as tasty.  The service was also very fast and friendly.  I would definitely come back here again!"}
{"text":"After driving past it for a whole summer I finally decided to drag my brother there (we're both complete foodies). We were not dissapointed. 

Not only is it cozy like your grandma's house, strung with adorable lights, the food is reminescent as well. The oyster po-boy my brother got was perfectly delicious. As was the quiche that I got. It was quite hardy and filling. The fruit cup too (as I've seen other's mention) is truly filled with appealing fruits. They definitely don't skimp on giving  you a large portion. I even decided to bring a larger group there, and everyone seemed pretty happy with the choice! They are a unique find. I wish they were closer to my home and I'd go more often. Another thing that is kind of a downer is the parking. It's a little bit of a challenge. 

The service was also good. I was convinced to get a dessert even though I was full. I took it to go and it was yummy! :)"}
{"text":"Fenwick's Sunday brunch is the shizzzzzz. I dream about it. Not only is the food amazing (and fast!), but the two ladies who always work this shift are the absolute nicest. (And just a smidge sassy! Love it!) The mimosas and bloody marys are MASSIVE. If you're a philistine and not in the mood for breakfast, their burgers are the best I've had in Charlotte. I wish I could move in."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. It quaint right in the heart of busy Charlotte.  Our entire meal, which included appetizer, entree & dessert, was superb.  We understand how this place has been here forever and are just sorry we haven't discovered it sooner.

{"text":"Neighborhood favorite among residents of Myers Park and Eastover.  Other reviewers are correct...this place is TINY!  Unless you can manage to snag one of the four booths, don't count on having a private conversation because you will be sitting very close to your neighbor.  That being said, the soups are homemade (and delicious!) and the burgers are solid.  I've also heard rave reviews of the oyster po'boy, steak sandwich, and the bread budding."}
{"text":"What is the deal with this place?  I had driven by numerous times and seen the sparkling reviews on yelp, so I figured that i would stop in.  The wife and I headed over on a Saturday night, and we walk in to find a very cozy, non-descript, not very formal looking restaurant.  It was mainly empty despite being a Saturday.  I was expecting something a little more formal, or a little more original, or more of something.  But that`s ok, I can deal with generic every once in a while.  Then I checked out the menu - and I was shocked by the premium prices that they were charging - 15-25 dollars per entree.  Everything comes with a generic salad and the portions are quite large, but the food was as generic  as the ambience.  I should have had the foresight to know that hummus in a place like this is not the best choice.  The service was fine, people were friendly, but  I can get much tastier food at Dish or the Diamond for about half the price."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers in town! Small and intimate neighborhood restaurant where the husband wife team command the delivery of the delicious food and service. My friends claim the tomato bisque is a favorite as well as the avocado smash. Me? I just can't get past the burger! 
Cheers!"}
{"text":"WOW!  I found this restaurant through Yelp while visiting Charlotte with my husband & a few friends.  When we arrived they were a little concerned about my choice based on the fact that it is a quaint little building but upon departure they were stuffed & delighted with their meals.  Excellent service & great food in a quaint little cottage!  Highly recommend :o)"}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of my favorites and had been for years.  The food is consistently excellent, the wait staff friendly but not intrusive, and the ambiance casual and intimate.   It's no wonder everyday they are packed for lunch and you have to arrive by 11:45 (at the latest) to secure a table.   I have so many favorites that I never branch out beyond them anymore.   Their blackened chicken salad is a Monday special but you can request it any day even though it's not on the menu.  Try it with the Parmesan peppercorn dressing.  My husband loves their quiche (yes, real men eat quiche) and the turkey clubs.   We always start with a cup of tomato bisque soup which is phenomenal.  They may have the best hamburger in town but I think this place offers the best of everything.

I also enjoy walking by their bar and seeing individuals eating by themselves.  It's the kind of place you don't remain a stranger for long."}
{"text":"This place absolutely SUCKS. Went for the first time the other day because I was in the area and read all these rave reviews. The server suggested my friend and I get the burger... Mistake #1. The burger was flavorless and dry. I'd go as far to say, it was in my top 3 worst burgers I've ever had.  Secondly, we asked for our fries to be cooked crispy. Does no one in Charlotte know how to make crispy French fries?! After choking down a few bites, we decided to abandon ship because the flies that were circling our food looked pretty hungry. It's disheartening the lack of effort going into food preparation at this establishment and that consumers are careless enough to eat here."}
{"text":"Traffic on Providence was at a stand still so we skirted into the parking lot thinking we might as well eat and let the traffic ease up.  We were seating in a small (very small) table for two - hubby's chair was constantly being bumped by people going by - this space was was too cramped and once another sat down at the next table, I felt like every work of our conversation was being heard.  OF course, they ended up taking a phone call during our meal, so we were privy to her conversation.  Guess it never occurred to her to take the call outside so as not to disturb others.  Love the sense of importance some people get when they take a call in a public space - LOL.  Anyway, the meal was just mehy - London broil which I ordered medium rare came out medium well and was tough as nails.  Rice and fruit were good.  Hubby's chicken pot pie was just passable.  Maybe if they remove a couple of tables and open up the space, we would return to try the food again but not until then."}
{"text":"Perfect food amazing service delicious timely and friendly - what more can you ask for? A favorite spot to visit that has. Even consistently wonderful for so many years- thanks for great everything!"}
{"text":"Good food, I loved my one time there.  Nice staff as well.  I agree with the other comments on Fenwicks.  I think I could eat there every night for a week."}
{"text":"I went in for breakfast on Jan 10  2016, (Sunday morning) and ordered the corned beef hash. It is a favorite Meal of mine and l order it almost whenever l find it on a menu. 
I have to admit that the dish that was served up to me was without doubt one of the worst presented and worst tasting dishes l have ever encountered.
It was simply a slop of a few diced up boiled potatoes that had not been drained properly, a few chopped up pieces of corned beef, two poached eggs and a leaf of parsley. The meal was so uninteresting to look at that it would not have been out of place in a pheasant household somewhere in rural Ireland during the great potato famine.
It really was that awful.
I was not at all enthralled with the meal, but ate what l could. l had not looked at the price when l ordered but assumed it would be about $8 to $9, (which l would have accepted as okay and chalked it up to a lesson and not ordered that particulate dish there ever again.)
What thoroughly annoyed me was the fact that they charged an incredulous $19 for the dish!!!
This in my mind is a complete and utter rip off and the reason l took the time to actually write this review.
If an establishment wants to charge by far a higher than average price, then they have an obligation to deliver by far a higher than average product. 
A note to the chef, your clientele are not pheasants, nor are they in rural bloody Ireland during the great potato famine! Please don't treat them as such!
Paying $19 for a slop of boiled potatoes and a few chips of corned beef is not right. (Not even Oliver Twist would have asked for more!)
To be fair however, the table next to me were having a salad of sorts that they seemed to thoroughly enjoy, so maybe it was just this particular dish that needs attention. 
For the record, I did mention the the waitress that I was not happy with the meal, she did offer not to charge me full price for it, which was very kind of her, but it just seems kind of cliched and hollow to complain about a meal in order to get a discount so l paid the full price and a proper tip and addressed the matter in this manner instead."}
{"text":"Came through Charlotte to see my folks and picked this place based on the good reviews. We were pleased with the visit and thought it was fairly represented. The wait staff was very friendly and attentive (rarely an empty water glass). The menu had a few choices that looked great and I went with the fish (trout) which was slightly overcooked, but still good. Prices were higher than expected on first glance, but the meal came with a very good garden salad, two good sides and very warm bread. I'd come hear again for the good service and good and healthy food. Four stars feels right on this one."}
{"text":"Likes: Good neigborhood location, nice intimate feel inside, good steaks
Highly recommend the weekend brunch

Gripes: limited seating, not a good place for large groups, over priced (soup/sandwich - is easily $17) 

Bottom line: A good place for a weekday dinner when you don't want to cook and a great weekend brunch."}
{"text":"i love Fenwicks and have been coming here ever since i was little. The tomato bisque is my favorite and it will have me craving hot soup in 100 heat with humidity lol. now whenever i can stop by and pick up a pint of soup i will. everything here is good, you cant go wrong on the menu. ive had pretty much everything from filet to crab-cakes to breakfast. i am a big lover of pecan pie, and however im picky and they have an amazing pecan pie. its truly yummy, and with homemade whip and a strawberry, you cant go wrong!"}
{"text":"I am Gluten Intolerant so eating out is always a challenge. Saturday after a busy day at work my coworker wanted to go grab a bite to eat. She said she used to go eat here all the time-so I was game. She was getting the fish and chips, which I hadn't had in years. After talking to the waitress she told me that they could make the fish and chips with corn meal instead of flour-and she told me she preferred it that way. They didn't have a dedicated fryer but that was ok for me. They were great. I would definitely get it again. And the fact that the waitress was so knowledgeable and acommodating to my dietary needs was above and beyond what most would do. It was greatly appreciated."}
{"text":"Can't say enough about this place.  Walking distance is a plus for me as well.  Staff is always attentive and friendly. Enjoyed brunch there in several occasions as well as lunch.  Great local privately owned business do get a good inexpensive meal then head to manor theater for a flick. Thanks Ladies!!"}
{"text":"Great brunch place! Food was awesome. It's small and there was a bit of a wait. It would be better if they had a reservation system but the food def made it worth it."}
{"text":"Reasons why Fenwick's is awesome:

1. They have fried oyster po-boys and they are delicious
2. There is a patio with twinkly lights
3. The dining room is like a hallway - cozy!
4. When I ordered a fruit side I got cantaloupe, orange, grapefruit, pineapple, and watermelon - a cornucopia of fruity goodness
5. 82% of the customers were geriatric when I went (at 8:30p on a Tues night - why aren't they in bed?  Because Fenwick's is awesome.)
6. The zucchini and squash casserole side I had was inhale-ably good
7. It's in a little cottage

I'm looking forward to checking Fenwick's out for breakfast.  The menu is limited, check before you go!"}
{"text":"This week's Excited about Eating visits Fenwick's in the Myers Park neighborhood of Charlotte. 

Comfortable and homey with meals prepared similar to what your mom might cook, this local place offers a variety of food, all homemade. 

I ordered one of the breakfast specials and my favorite, corned beef and poached eggs (my preference.) ::Dora here. Poached? Ick! Only scrambled for me, please. :)::, potatoes, toast and fruit. The corned beef and eggs were cooked perfectly, and the portions hearty.

Dora here. The Chicken Salad Croissant Sandwich was chunky and meaty, not overloaded with mayo, but not zinging with flavor, either. I'm not a fan of honeydew, so I was thrilled to find a place that makes a fruit salad minus the dreaded melon. :) 

Service was friendly and quick. If it's sunny and warm, plan to linger on the outdoor patio. If not, get there early. Not much indoor seating. ~Ernie & Dora Hiers, Fiction Faith & Foodies Blog"}
{"text":"Fenwick's is one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte.  It's tiny,  I mean there might be 4 tables and 6 booths in the entire restaurant, but the intimacy of this location is one of things that makes it special.  The other thing that make it special is the fillet sandwich, which is delicious.  I highly recommend the fried oysters as an appetizer, as well as the huge thick, onion rings.  The only down thing in my opinion is that they do not served iced tea...seriously your in Charlotte, this is the south, and we loooove some iced tea.  But other than  that this is a great restaurant with a very close and private vibe.  Fenwick's is located just on Providence road just past the Providence Queens intersection in the heart of Myers park.  If you're in Charlotte, do dinner at Fenwick's."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good service, not much seating but enough to have a great supper. Also has a bar for the ones who like to drink and socialize!"}
{"text":"You have to go and get the steak sandwich... its made with filet mignon and comes with fresh fruit and home made fries.....  I am addicted!"}
{"text":"Small cute place, outdoor seating, limited parking in front - but I think there were more in the back. 

We went for Sunday Brunch. Arrived around 11am. No wait for a table for two outside.

The menu had omelets with a variety of 'fillings' with no limits - unless we read the menu wrong. It also offered other typical breakfast dishes (i.e. french toast, Eggs Benedict).

The server was so friendly and made her personal recommendations (which we both took and were satisfied with).  

I had the special popover and sister, visiting from out of town, had one of the special omelets. Both served with fresh fruit. Mine was served with grits (comes with cheese so specify if you do not want) and the coffee bread/bar. Coffee was good and kept on coming.  The 'hash browns' that came with my sister's plate were a bit dry and just really diced potatoes - I was glad I went with the grits.

Brunch was just A-okay. Would like to go back to try dinner soon."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  I have dined alone and with a group here on multiple occasions.  Great service.  Food is very 'home style' so the feel is like Mom made it...if your Mom could cook like mine.

The only reason it's not a five-star plus is the price.  Seems high for what you get...but what you get is very, very good.

The roast is absolutely awesome.  And save room for dessert.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Small place with LARGE taste is the best way to sum up this place. I've had this place saved (bookmarked) on Yelp for some time now and was finally able to check it out yesterday for lunch. While in the area for an appointment that we were a hour early to I decided to check ole trusty (Yelp) for nearby lunch and a list came up in which several were bookmarked and as I browsed and read aloud while being chauffeured by my husband who was more than ready to stop for food he made a quick turn, it appears Fenwicks was on the right as I read the list of nearby places and he pulled right in.

The parking lot is their downside and almost warranted us to leave and leave the bookmark and try again another day. We pulled around the narrow side to the back which was just as full as the front, there are like 7spots on the front and side total and about 5 in the back. We noticed cars in this BP lot that could very well be in the restaurant but didn't want to take any chances. We began to pull out and leave when a lady walked out and waved us down saying she was done and leaving (A SIGN to STAY). We parked front door style ;-)

We were welcomed by not one but two and then a third person. We were seated immediately in a cozy booth and began to browse the menu. I initially saved this place because I planned to join them for brunch but I figured if there is a huge hype over brunch the lunch couldn't be too far behind if not better.

We ordered the hummus appetizer, a veggie burger with grilled onions and mushrooms and Swiss and a beef burger made the same way both with fresh cut fries.

When I say the veggie burger was AMAZING, I mean it. My husband burger was juicy and tasty as well per him. The fries were super fresh and tasty.

We noticed a couple sharing bread pudding which is our favorite and they shared with us that it's the best in Charlotte so we planned to try BUT was to full after eating so we will be back to try the bread pudding.

The only con is the size of this place and the parking situation."}
{"text":"Great lunch!  Large portions and very personable and attentive service. Fried shrimp was tasty with a light batter."}
{"text":"I've driven past this place about a hundred times and always wanted to stop. With it being Restaurant Week and every other restaurant in the city booked up, I decided tonight was the night. The restaurant itself is really small. Has a local, neighborhood feel. Food was great. American and Seafood mostly. True southern charm in the wait staff. I had the shrimp with Mac n cheese and broccoli. Didn't save room for dessert but those sounded great."}
{"text":"This is our fave brunch spot and we love that the specials change and that no matter how often we go it's still ridiculous hard to decide what to order.  The avocado smash is amazing!  It's like avocado toast on steroids with tomatoes and a fried egg and more.  If you haven't been to fenwicks go!  

Ps. House made Bloody Mary mix
Pps. Get a side of toast and home made strawberry butter"}
{"text":"I am updating because I saw how old my last review of Fenwick's was, and I wanted to say that I stand by my past reviews which give a better rundown of what to expect, so I won't repeat myself.  Many restaurants go down over time, but not Fenwick's.  Service and food are consistently good over time.  I am still obsessed with Fenwick's Sunday brunch, which I wrote about in my last review.   I still say their burger is one of the best in Charlotte.  There is no change in my opinion that the appetizers (oysters, wings, hand cut fries and onion rings) are excellent.  If anything, food has gotten a bit better with some noticed experimentation in the kitchen.  Patio seating is nice with good weather.

Casual, not fancy, neighborhood gem.   Special feature:  Bar seating is excellent for those who enjoy having others at their table, and particularly friendly for singles.  If you (man or woman) are looking for a comfortable place to eat solo and don't have a companion to join you, you will be welcomed here."}
{"text":"I Love this place they have the best Burgers!! I find myself here on random Sundays and the ladies working here are great they have definitely been here for a long time and know everything on the menu!! The food is always great - i seriously always get a burger but we start with the wings with the sauce on the side and they are really good nice and crispy!!  The BF gets the Fried Oysters Appetizer its a HUGE portion and plenty on there that he cant even finish himself!! The only thing I would say negative was we went when it was 100 out and it was pretty warm in there but they cant help it with an open kitchen. Its a great place in a great area!"}
{"text":"I planned an event here with some girlfriends for an early dinner. The place is easy to miss, because it's a small building so if you blink or aren't paying attention you will get lost (trust me...I know). Also, just a head's up with the place being so small parking is a bit of a pain. In fact it's pretty non-existent. There's a few spaces in the front and if you're lucky they have a few in the back...if all those are full....good luck! 

That being said, the menu is pretty simple. I think they are going for down home favorites. There are your staple dishes like meatloaf, burgers, fish and salads. But I just wasn't overly impressed with the menu. I opted for the Veggie Burger and fries. It's your typical Morning Star veggie burger so nothing to be amazed about there and the fries were just okay. 

The service was great but I'm just not sure I'd make it a priority to give them another try. Based on the reviews, their brunch might be worth another visit. We'll see!"}
{"text":"This is a neat spot, frozen in time. It has been around a long while - the staff is maybe the most friendly, personable in town. I have had lunch there several times - can't speak for dinner. I really like some of the sandwiches and burger. They have a nice little patio out front so when the weather is good, check it out. Parking can be challenging... but Fenwick's is a neighborhood staple, so a lot of the locals will walk."}
{"text":"I had some family in this area of town and got some recommendations to come here for lunch.  The family enjoyed some light lunch fare from crispy shrimp po-boys to a classic croissant and chicken salad.  Fries and onion rings crunchy, service with a sense of humor.  We enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how this place became a Charlotte institution, but it definitely doesn't deserve the recognition. The burger was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"AWESOME!!!! Been here many times in the last year and it never disappoints. Its def my favorite go to spot. The in house made mimosas for Sunday brunch are the best I've ever had. Everyone is always so friendly. The service, the food, its all exceptional. Its a nice little hidden gem in CLT."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give Fenwicks 5 stars ohh they were so close.  Came here for brunch on Sunday with a few friends before heading over to a movie at the Manor.  This place is so cozy and the service is fantastic. 
The restaurant is really small but that is what I like about it - not a great place for a crowd but an awesome place for a couple for brunch, lunch, or dinner.  

The brunch menu had a great selection, eggs benedict, crabcakes eggs benedict, berry pancakes, bananas fosters french toast just to name a few items.  I choose the eggs benedict the postitive first... the canadian bacon was delicious the hollandaise sauce was right on point the crispy potatoes were amazing and the fresh fruit was REALLY fresh no fruit cups here.  The eggs however were a little over done...I was slightly disappointed but I will definilty be back again to try some other items.

* The coffee cake was melt in your mouth good...I would have this as my meal next time."}
{"text":"Oh dear god the food was good. We arrived :25 mins before they closed (totally didn't think about this being Christmas Eve) and the server didn't act like she was totally ready to get home. 

We had a party of five. Two of us had the crab cakes with hollandaise, one had the popover, one had a burger and another had a veggie burger. We LOVED our food. The crab cake w/sauce was amaze-balls. So yummy. 

My husband had the veggie burger and said it's the best he's ever had...he's had many before. 

Will def return."}
{"text":"Good food I must say. But this place is a little dated and tiny tiny!!! Its American food and a one hit for me."}
{"text":"Fenwicks is consistently good!The servers are all fun & professional.Food is fresh & served up pretty.If looking for a nice meal in Charlotte, Fenwicks is your place!"}
{"text":"My colleagues and I are in Charlotte for business, staying at the Duke Mansion. We don't have a car, so on our first night here we walked the neighborhood in search of food. Fenwick's Restaurant is less than 5 minutes away by foot, and looking to avoid a chain like Panera Bread, we popped in.

What a great decision. 

We so much enjoyed our first visit that we went back again tonight, and we may go tomorrow night for our last meal in town. Between us we've had the grilled chicken sandwich, red beans and rice, chicken and sasauge jambalaya, fried flounder, honey glazed pork chops, crab cakes, pot roast, key lime pie, and pecan cream pie.

Every single dish was well prepared, hot, flavorful, tender, tasty, etc. 

I had never been to Charlotte before this week, and stumbling into Fenwick's has made my first visit to this city worth it.

The place is quite small, but I don't see that as a drawback. We observed dozens of locals each night. Locals that are consistently in a restaurant signal good food, service, and people.

Fenwick's is a winner."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch while visiting Charlotte on the advice of Yelpers. I was satisfied, but not overly impressed.

I got the Eggs Benedict. If you are here because you're looking for a metric ton of meat in that dish, you will have come to the right place, because the serving of Canadian bacon was ENORMOUS. It was tasty, but I've had the dish taste better for less money.

Waitstaff was a little absent. I had to wait at least 15 minutes and then specifically request a refill on my hot water for tea.

The ambience is very diner-cozy. I liked it. If I lived around Charlotte, I'd be back to try something else--maybe one of the specials everyone likes so much?"}
{"text":"Having dined at Fenwicks at least five times, my review is past due.  This is my go-to place on Monday nights, as many Cajun and Creole specials prevail.  Suggest an entree that includes a soup: the gumbo is out of this world, without a doubt the most delicious I've ever enjoyed.  Top it off with fabulous pecan cream pie.  Fenwick's is a small, welcoming place that remains a rare breed in today's world of boring chain restaurants that offer mediocre food, ambiance, and service, at best."}
{"text":"A very small and quaint restaurant, with a tiny parking lot, but the service is large on friendly and quality.
The rib eye steak sandwich is the best in town cooked to order and something worth coming back for over and over.
They have really good chicken tenders apitizer  and a dipping sauce that compliments them very well.
Their fried shrimp are a good sized portion and go well with their  onion rings and the hummus apitizer is fabulous. All in all a fine choice to eat at and a restaurant I recommend. They do have a large selection of items in the Cajun / New Orleans style at the first of the week, worth trying"}
{"text":"I love the food at Fenwick's. It's the last meal I had before moving from Charlotte. I love this place and will miss the food tremendously."}
{"text":"Just driving around and spotted this little gem.  Owner greeted us right away and kept checking on us after we told him we were from out of town.  Place was busy for their apparently famous brunch, so a little slow on the food, but who is in a hurry in NC on Sunday.  Wife loved the Brunwich and the Sunday scramble I had was excellent, especially the grits.  Do yourself a favor and get the coffee cake.  It is not your average coffee cake.  We will be back when in town."}
{"text":"Brunch here is amazing. We could eat the breakfast salad for every meal, so many vegetables! Perfectly cooked and not drowning in sauce.  The avocado smash is incredible as well.  Shoot, everything is good. Our baby loves the cheesy grits, as do we, and the toddler eats all the side orders of pancakes, bacon, and eggs. Pro tips: side of eggs is maybe 3 scrambled eggs, and you can come a few minutes before opening to avoid the wait. The place is tiny and wonderful, and service is warm and friendly and fast. Don't forget to put the strawberry butter on the coffee cake and pancakes!"}
{"text":"For some reason I only go to Fenwicks with family. First, years ago with my grandparents and now I take my parents when they are in town. Its very telling that I have been eating here for probably 12 years and is always consistent. Fenwicks has the most amazing muffins. Luckily they come with most menu items and salads. I highly recommend their tomato bisque. Its warm, creamy and comforting. As I write this it is raining out and I can't think of anything more satisfying right now than that soup. Their entree salads are huge and fresh. The seating and parking are both limited but the steak sandwich is full of huge flavors- cooked just to my liking. Save room for dessert here. Everything tastes homemade and comforting."}
{"text":"I JUST KEEP COMING BACK!  I first stopped into Fenwick's in 2013.  I've been back almost every single Sunday for brunch since then - no exaggeration.  I REALLY love breakfast - don't judge me.

This place has become like a second family to me... it's mom & pop, it's genuine and the food is downright bomb.  **queue cheers theme song**

You want a damn good Sunday brunch?  Just do yourself a favor - go to Fenwick's.  Start with the pancake special and coffee cake with strawberry butter.  Order whatever you want off of the breakfast menu - it's all 5 star worthy, and then if you have any more room in those church pants you better order the bread pudding.  My momma raised me on homemade Kentucky Bourbon Bread Pudding and if you ever tell her I swear to ^^^ that I will hunt you down - but Fenwick's is better.

You want a homemade meal?  You got it.  There is no comparison for brunch in Charlotte on Sunday."}
{"text":"Excellent brunch! Very comfortable setting. The entire staff was very friendly and attentive. Our order arrived very quickly.  I will return."}
{"text":"Great spot for Brunch or Lunch

It's been a number of years since we have dined at Fenwick's but were in the area today and it's as good as ever.

Small restaurant on the North End of Myers Park but always crowded. Today was not exception but we were able to get a table inside very quickly. A bit too warm outside for patio dining but a nice option in cooler weather.

We were promptly seated and I was pleasantly surprised when I ordered my customary sweet tea. I was informed, we don't have sweet tea but can serve you with simple syrup on the side and you can sweeten it to your taste. This is what I have been advocating for years.

Several nice specials but we opted to order directly off of the menu.  My wife could not resist the urge to go with the Pecan Cinnamon Coffeecake with a bowl of fruit as a side. She must have liked it because there there was not one crumb left.

I opted for the Tripledecker Club Sandwich with fries as a side. Both were delicious although I can't remember having a Club Sandwich before with fresh cucumber. Pickles I've had, but never fresh cucumbers but it was a nice twist and gave a nice contrast in texture.  The fries were excellent and the potion size on both was more than ample.

Great service and a nice atmosphere.  Only complaint is that parking is a little tight.

Would recommend to anyone looking for a good spot for breakfast, brunch or lunch."}
{"text":"Drove by a lunch time and it looked like a nice place to try.  It is!   Had some delicious fried shrimp, potato salad, steamed broccoli and a tasty roll.  Staff was very nice and helpful, PLUS I got to sit in what they called a \"half booth\". It was cool!  I can definitely see stopping in again."}
{"text":"Avg good food.   Cozy place and great staff, but getting a well well done burger when ordering it medium, knocked it down a star.   The other knock down star was the prices.   Unique environment, prob a staple in the area, but I dont think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Soooooooo happy we came here for brunch last week!! The service was excellent! Everyone was so friendly and the restaurant had a cozy feel. Very comforting. 
Our server was so personable and extremely knowledgable of the menu which is a plus for me. She was very detailed and spot on with her recommendations. 
I had the oysters Benedict with cheese grits. It also came with some of the best fruit salad I've had in a long time. The oysters were perfectly seasoned and the egg was a PERFECT poached egg. *its very easy to screw up a poached egg*. The cheese grits I chose weren't the best I've had. They were a little on the watery and bland side. I was hoping they would be thicker. I'm a grits snob...sorry. 
My bf had the scramble if the day which was delicious! He also had the cheese grits and felt the same way I did. 
Oh my goodness! Ok so I almost forgot about our \"breakfast appetizer\" after reading someone's tip on here about the pancakes we had to give them a try since the bf loves pancakes.  The pancakes of the day were Red, White and Blue pancakes. They had strawberries, blueberries and WHITE CHOCOLATE CHIPS! AMAZING!!! I am NOT a fan of pancakes. Yes I'm weird! But these were sooooo frkn good! You can tell they were made from scratch deliciousness!
Overall Fenwicks is a win! 

Oh and their mimosas will have you nice. One will do it."}
{"text":"One thing I love are small neighborhood eateries that just have a great local feel to it. Fenwick's is that spot! The entire restaurant can fit maybe 30 people max, but their food is awesome. Went their for brunch one time after a night of drinking, and their customer service was awesome. Our waiter was very friendly and somehow convinced our entire table to get mimosas. May I remind you, I couldnt even hear the word alcohol because of the night before, but she convinced us anyway.

Ordered an omelette with everything you can think of and it was actually cooked pretty well. The food is very exceptional and the bread pudding is to die for.

I came into the restaurant starving and it took a little to seat 8 people, so thats the only reason for the four stars. But I do understand that it comes with the small size of the establishment."}
{"text":"This is my favorite brunch spot! I always bring family here too. All the specials are unique and delicious. I usually go for the fritatta, it comes with salsa, coffee cake, and a side. A lot of food for an affordable price. The place is super tiny so it's quite tight but they get you in and out quickly. The waitresses are very nice. The owner is often there and he's incredibly accommodating and friendly as well."}
{"text":"Went for our first time on a Friday afternoon and had a great relaxed lunch! Very friendly staff & quick service. Our sever was so sweet & knew the menu well to answer our questiond about some of the dishes ingredients. Food was excellent and I can't wait to come for dinner and try one of the specials! Must try the orzo feta side dish-Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"The food was outstanding! I order hummus to start with and the arrangement was beautiful. I personally have trouble with dairy and gluten but they were able to accommodate that. I ordered the salmon lunch entree with Rice and a Salad and everything was perfect. My guest ordered the trout and she said it was delightful. Service was outstanding, very attentive, never ran out of drink  refills and got us whatever we needed in a timely fashion. Overall very impressed, we will be back."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy, but a super cute diner. A lot of food for a reasonable price. Quick service and homemade everything! Our waitress, Leah, was fantastic. There was a minor issue with our order. She was quick to get it corrected and even blessed us with complimentary dessert. It was quite possibly the best pecan pie I've had! We enjoyed our dinner here!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. 
We tried Fenwick's because of the great reviews and it was pretty good. I had a barbecue chicken breast (that was more like an ordinary chicken breast because I didn't taste or see any barbecue), with fries. It was good, but nothing particularly extraordinary about it. I liked that it wasn't too thick or dry. My husband had a California burger I believe. He liked it but I didn't taste it because it had guacamole all over it and I don't eat guacamole. I tasted my daughter's well-done London broil and it was shoe-leather tough! She said she liked it but I'm not sure how. I could hardly chew it. But....to each his own I guess. 

All in all, the place is cozy and comfortable for a lunch date and I liked what I had. I wasn't blown away or anything, and I find them to be a bit pricey. Some of their other menu items might be more impressive. Perhaps I'd go back in the future to try something different."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch... yum. We arrived right at 10:00 a.m. on a Sunday, and they were already open, and there were a few cars in the parking lot. It's fairly small inside, but thankfully we were able to grab the last booth.

I got the french toast ($11.50) with strawberry butter, which I ate right out of the cup,  and fruit, and I added a side of bacon ($3.50). Although I wondered out loud how I was going to eat it all, it turns out I didn't need to worry. Nom nom nom.

The fella got the Classic Breakfast ($11.95) with cheesy grits, ham, eggs over-medium, and toast. The grits were super cheesy, and the toast looked delicious... but someone never offered me a bite. Ahem. The ham also had some pretty nice char marks!

Great, fast service, delicious food, just a little pricey - $31ish for all that plus coffee and an OJ."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a comforting, delicious place to eat there is nothing better than Fenwick's. We just finished eating brunch there and the avocado smash has been, by far, my favorite breakfast meal. Everything my family received was outstanding and the atmosphere was truly pleasurable. The staff continually checked in on us to make sure everything was up to par. There is nothing better than going out to Sunday brunch on Easter with your family!!"}
{"text":"Fenwick's is the best.  A small neighborhood restaurant with a fabulous group of people working there and consistently great food.  They always have various specials, and will \"customize\" the order for each patron.  Great place, great people.  Other restaurants could take lessons from this place."}
{"text":"I finally made it around to Fenywicks to try their Sunday Brunch (11:00 to 3:00), and I was certainly not disappointed.  My choice was the Mixed Berry Buttermilk Pancakes with a side of smoked sausage and scrambled eggs.  My three pancakes were perfect! Light, tasty  -  a combination of blue berrys and thin slices of Strawberry.  The butter was blended with fresh strawberry juice. Fantastic!  The sausage was perfectly grilled and huge and the eggs were  light and tasty.  This reminded me of the old days back in the early nineties when Cathryn's had Sunday brunch customers standing in line out onto the street.  Making a choice was very difficult.    Two of the selections that caught my eye were the ever changing Frittata (a cross between a quiche and an omelette) and a muffin and Corned Beef Hash with two poached eggs, toast and fruit.  I will definitely be going back to Fenwicks on Sundays. Great Price ($6.95 - $13.95)), and the conviviality of Fenwicks wonderful staff and their regular customers.  Sundays at Fenwicks - just another reason why this is truly a little gem in Charlotte's Restaurant Crown!"}
{"text":"Fenwick's is a cute little restaurant! I came there solely because we needed outside seating for my little's foster dog. Little did I know, Fenwick's was absolutely welcoming and even brought her dog a water bowl. I had the quiche with fruit and a muffin. Everything was delicious! Outside seating is limited because the tables only offer 2 seats so we had to cram in. The service was good but it seemed like she wanted to serve the dog more than she wanted to serve us!"}
{"text":"Food good service good
Place very small sat at bar but it was cold the day I was there and every time door opened got a blast of cold air
When you open the men's room door the people sitting at bar can look right in
Not very appetizing
Very little parking"}
{"text":"I grew up in New Orleans and this place taste like home!  Just solid good eats. It's worth battling the parking lot for the awesome oyster Po boy or shrimp or red beans and rice.  Haven't had a bad meal here ever!"}
{"text":"This is a good date place.  Almost every time I go I get the special listed on the board.  Otherwise, I get the salad with the fried shrimp.  My favorite part of this salad besides the homemade thousand island dressing, is the muffin they serve with it.  I call it a muffin because it looks like one but it tastes like Boston Brown Bread which is usually served in a roll shape.  Super friendly service also."}
{"text":"This review is not very fair seeing how I have only been once and it was for brunch, which seems to not be in my favor. I was seated immediately, ordered steak and eggs promptly. 45 minutes later and pretty annoyed my meal showed up, the first thing that caught my eye was how small the steak was. Now I was not looking for something huge but it was quite small, possibly the smallest steak I have consumed. That would have not mattered as much if the steak was not stone cold and flavorless. The eggs were pouched nicely and still warm. I will give Fenwicks another shot for lunch because I have had left overs from coworkers and it has always been good."}
{"text":"Fenwick's is celebrating their 30th Anniversary! Congrats! This cozy family operated restaurant is conveniently located on the 500 block of Providence Road . The brunch here is very popular and there are always daily specials on the menu board!

Recently I got to sample their menu with some friends.

For appetizers, the hummus and onion rings are good, but the wings are best. Just the perfect crunch on the outside and tender inside, covered in a flavorful, killer sauce.

All of the entrees were delicious. The Salmon Filet portion on the salad was enormous! The standouts were definitely the London Broil plate and the Chicken Breast covered in creamy, cheesy goodness.

The best part was hands down the desserts! Whoa! Probably the best Key Lime pie I've ever had! The VCR, a vanilla custard with raspberry sauce and fresh strawberries was pretty amazing too!"}
{"text":"I stopped by for lunch and grabbed a quick bite... The wait from order to food wasn't long at all... The waitress at the bar made some small talk and was very sweet... 

The croissant I ordered with ham and swiss was delicious... I loved the ratio of meat and cheese to bread... Sometimes with croissants, it's hit or miss... lol  I was very unimpressed with the tomato bisque... The first couple of spoonfulls were really good, but then it just turned sugary out of nowhere... I couldn't finish it... 

The parking definitely leaves a lot to be desired... And the lot could stand to be repaved, so watch your wheels as you navigate... 

If I'm in the area, I might venture in again... It wasn't bad, but it didn't knock my socks off either... Maybe I'll order something different next time..."}
{"text":"Another staple in Charlotte.  Don't come here if you need ambiance or something fancy.  They do good food and they do it right.  I'm a fan of the salads but it was apparent on our latest venture out that the fried oysters are a huge favorite.  Nearly everyone around us was ordering those and our waitress was kind enough to give us samples.  

The staff here is another solid reason to visit.  Always super duper nice and attentive.  Parking is a bit tough with only a few spots out front.  There is more in the back but it's a little tricky to navigate."}
{"text":"This restaurant was ok. We ordered the chicken special and the chicken was over cooked and the veggies were more sautéed than I like. But they do give you a lot of food for your price point. If I did go back, I would probably try something off the menu instead of the specials as they may not be used to making the specials."}
{"text":"Amazing service and AMAZING food. Seriously. Had a side order of one of the specials (bananas foster)... it had homemade sauce and homemade whip cream.. one of the best things I've ever eaten. Everything else was amazing too."}
{"text":"Parking is horrible. Place is very small, some would say \"cozy\". Not quite what I would expect in comparison to the prices they charge. Food wasn't bad though. I had the steak sandwich which was surprisingly tender. Won't make this a go to place but in a pinch I would go back."}
{"text":"This is a very welcoming place. We went for brunch   The food was amazing prob size more than adequate. Everything was well seasoned and delicious. We got to meet the chef and owner. I would recommend this to everyone. I want to go back and explore other items on the menu . Can't wait to go back and try additional items. We were there for brunch . Would like to go for dinner next time"}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Definitely need to pay attention where you're driving otherwise you may drive past it! It's a small and quaint building that seems to fit in customers to the best of their advantage. Only downside is that the booth next to you can hear your conversations pretty easily. Their use of mirrors throughout make the space seem bigger, but can be a little trippy. Somewhat outdated interior, but it's cozy.

Food/drink: I ate one of their specials which was an open faced ham/avocado/cheese sandwich with an egg on top which was very good. Their diced potatoes were delicious - crispy, but not dried out! I also drank a bloody mary there in about 0.5 seconds, it was too good!"}
{"text":"Besides the onion rings I'm not sure how this place has any business.  Generic food and the server acted annoyed we were even there."}
{"text":"Really delicious brunch and interesting specials. All of the servers are really nice and personable - definitely start to remember you. 

Love their french toast served with strawberry butter!"}
{"text":"Very good food with great service.  We were staying at the Duke Mansion and walked over in less than 10 minutes.   
My husband had the Delicious shrimp and grits and I had a wonderful berry salad.   Our waitress was so sweet and made us feel welcome.  If you are looking for a good local place this is it."}
{"text":"I ordered the buffalo wings, Shrimp Po Boy and gumbo.

1.  Was only fried chicken with a tabasco sauce.
2.  Shrimp Po Boy was good.  Nothing special.
3.  Gumbo was so salty I was afraid my ankles were going to start swelling.

Even the pasta salad that my co-worker got was so salty that he asked to change it with a veggie burger."}
{"text":"tiny little place, don't let the big mirror fool you.
but excellent food, non pretentious."}
{"text":"The food is certainly better than ok - definitely 4 stars. The lack of the 4th star is mainly due to service. My boyfriend ordered grits with his breakfast after inquiring if they were good (so they literally had a conversation about it) but then she brought him fruit instead. The server was nowhere to be seen so he just sucked it up and ate the wrong side. At the end of our meal we finally resorted to placing our credit card at the end of the table...and still it actually ended up being another server who took it. 

Another slight issue is that we sat in the half booth which was a bit cramped but overall fine for one meal. The problem was that they sat someone at the end of the booth in front of us but he was placed in a way where it was literally as though we had another dining partner...really a bit awkward. Perhaps when someone is seated in that seat they keep the booth in front at max capacity. 

The most important thing in my opinion is that the food was good. Fries were crisp, my croissant buttery. I had the turkey and swiss which was delicious. My boyfriend thought portions were a bit small but as far as taste goes there are no complaints.

Food trumps a lot of things in my opinion so I'd give it another shot."}
{"text":"We have only been here a couple of times.  The pimento cheese is on point.  It not only comes with pita bread, but veggies as well. ( see photo)

We decided to split the filet.  It was tender and cooked perfectly.  The chef split our salads and meal on two different plates for us.  The vegetable of the day was green beans and they were flavorful with mushrooms and onions as an added bonus.

The service was quick and the waitress was very attentive.  The timing in between courses was really nice.  They hand write out your ticket at the end of the meal which is a nice old school touch!"}
{"text":"This place is small but I could eat here everyday. It is that good. They give generous quiche portions and boy is it delicious!! Their tomato bisque is to die for and their salads with homemade croutons are really fresh. Everyone in our family always wants to eat here. It's just a little expensive but it is so worth it."}
{"text":"I had a really good dinner a few nights ago, and was in and out of the place in less than an hour. There was no wait, and as we sat there the tables got filled up, so by the time we left people were waiting. It's a very small restaurant, with maybe room for 20 or 25 people in side. There's some seating outside, but fronting Providence Road is kind of noisy place to be, and didn't strike me as a good idea to enjoy dinner by.

Service was extremely efficient. I've never had food come out that fast that wasn't at a Mexican restaurant. But it all appeared to have been freshly made, and was very very tasty.

I would give it 5 stars for the food, but the ambience was a little too crowded and hurried, which made it hard to just relax and enjoy dinner. Overall definitely will look forward to coming back another time."}
{"text":"Fantastic burger and fried oysters...really one of the best burgers in the city. Crowd can be somewhat on the older side but the service is top notch and super nice. Good martinis as well."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Fried oysters for appetizer and London Broil for the main course is a top shelf tandem. Homemade whipped cream on the pecan pie seals the deal."}
{"text":"This is a neighborhood gem and one of my go-to restaurants in Charlotte for lunch.  The waitstaff is consistent, friendly, and always remember you.  Each time I come they remember exactly what my wife and I order to drink, the appetizer we order (the hummus plate each time, it is great), and our main course (grilled chicken sandwich with a side of honey mustard, fruit as the side, and a grilled chicken salad, dressing on the side).  Whatever they marinate their chicken in is delicious.  Try it once, you'll find yourself going back every week - and it is next to a Ben & Jerry's.  Specials are good, decent outdoor seating.  Lunch here and dinner down the street at Providence cafe is a solid Myers Park / Eastover day in my book."}
{"text":"Haven't been in here in like 12 years since I first moved to CLT...and i regret it.  I forgot about how GOOD the food is here.  

I am so tired of eating at my usual staples....and it's really nice to re-discover this gem.  

Like everyone says: space is small, parking is limited, eating alone at the bar is comfortable, and waitstaff is friendly and acts like they have known you forever.

Went for Sunday Brunch and had 4 in our party.  Surprisingly, we got a booth right away.

The breakfast food i ordered was an egg plate which had bacon, ham, sausage, peppers, japs, onion and mushrooms on it.  I also ordered cheese grits, hash browns, and a piece of coffee cake.  I was a hungry boy.  The flavors were unmatched by any other brunch in town.....the presentation was full of color and garnished with fresh fruit and greens.  All in all....it was nice to look at even more of a pleasure experience to eat.

I think im addicted to this place now and will be going back on a regular basis."}
{"text":"I remember going to Fenwick's when I was in middle school.  My mom would take me to lunch after I got my braces tightened.  I would order the beef tenderloin salad--I must say a strange choice for not only a 11 year old, but an 11 year old who just had her braces tightened.  Anyways- the salads are generous portions and the protein options are quite delicious! I ate here on a whim last Saturday night.  Talk about a blast from the past!  

We started with the hummus appetizer.  I thought the hummus was a little bit off, but it was a nice healthy option.  

Per our waitress's recommendation, we split the bread pudding for dessert.  Move over Customshop...you have met your match!  It is like bread pudding met a cinnamon bun and a toaster strudel and made a delicious baby!  You must try it!"}
{"text":"Great place, home cooking , can't go wrong with anything .  The on the board  specials are the real prize though .....Monday nights are cajun nights (the owner/chef is from New Orleans).....burger and fries are best in charlotte. Veggie burger is solid, fish and chips are nice on a cold night. Tomato bisque soup is on the menu nightly and highly rec'd.....great bar to sit at for lunch or dinner.....everyone is super friendly but not imposing.......and to finish your meal, go for the bread pudding - better than any you've ever had!"}
{"text":"I went there for brunch on Sunday...The food was great I ordered the Strawberry Shortcake  Pancakes  only thing is it was not filling I was still  hungry. It came with 3 pancakes  next time I would order extra at 1$ a piece. It is small on the inside and parking is tight. I would go again."}
{"text":"Very nice cozy restaurante.  Food is awesome. Servers very friendly. Nice surprise to find this place."}
{"text":"I drove past this place, saw it busy, and decided to give it a try. From the start, it was obvious that this is a well established local hangout. Everyone was super friendly and immediately gave me suggestions on what to order (which was great because I was ordering to go and for other people.) I saw the Cobb salad someone else was eating and decided to get 2. It came with piles of grilled chicken and really fresh grape tomatoes. The croutons were the best I've ever had. This was no cheap quick fix. They were fresh and moist with a potato taste to them. It was large and filling. We both enjoyed it very much. For desert we shared an order of bread pudding which was made traditionally, swimming in a sweet Bourbon sauce. Very good. I will go there again, and this time we will eat in and chat with all of the wonderful people there. In fact, someone at the office spotted our food and I sent them over there to try themselves."}
{"text":"I've heard so many wonderful things about Fenwick's and after 5 years of living in Charlotte, I finally tried it!  AND so glad I did!!  The hummus was amazing.  My veggie burger was incredible.  The patio seating outside was so peaceful...our server was beyond attentive!  And only a 2 minute walk from the regal manor twin for a movie afterwards :)"}
{"text":"My first time in this restaurant and I was extremely impressed.  I didn't know that they had been around for a long time, until someone recommended it recently.  The waitress was one of the nicest I've had in a long time.  She gave us plenty of time to look over the menu, gave exceptional recommendations, and was very knowledgeable of the menu.  The food comes in LARGE portions, so beware. Sharing an entree and one appetizer is plenty for two people.  The entree comes with soup or salad AND two sides.  I wanted to try dessert but was entirely too full.  Guess that's a good excuse to come back."}
{"text":"My friends and I stopped for lunch and loved it. The quiche was delicious and the service was equally good. It's small but very quaint. I want to return to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Wonderful meal in a cozy environment. The staff was so friendly and our meal was delicious. The pasta special was our favorite. We will be back."}
{"text":"Excellent Brunch!  We got egg whites, pancakes, grits, fruit...as well as the Tuna on Croissant with Egg Salad.  It was very filling!  And their tomato bisque soup was outstanding.  Definitely a cute spot for a date or meeting with a small group of friends.  The staff is very friendly.  Come early as this place gets packed quick!"}
{"text":"Definitely a favorite in Charlotte! 
I love their Brunch Menu. Very well convenient for the parking and great place to experience some southern food."}
{"text":"I love this place. Relatively small simple menu with around 5-8 constantly changing specials. Always very high quality food that tastes great. Has that small neighborhood place feel. One of my favorite places in Charlotte to eat. If I had to come up with one negative thing, the parking situation could be better."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place for brunch this past Sunday and became an immediate fan!  It's very small but super cozy and with tons of charm! The host is a fun guy to be around and our server was great too.  This little establishment reminds me as to why I chose to live in the Elizabeth neighborhood. I ordered the avocado smash and there was not one crumb left when I was finished. It was so good that I went to the grocery store to buy all the items to replicate the dish. You've got to try this place!  I can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"I had not been here in years, but my husband and I were driving that way, and I suggested it because of fond food memories.  He had never been here and was game  for a new experience.
This place reminds me of a Waffle House with a bar, and I say that in the nicest way. It is small, narrow and long, with some tables, booths and half booths. We sat at the bar, and the bartender reminded us of a Waffle House waitress:  sincere, efficient, and friendly.  I can imagine that she would treat guests in her own home the way she treated us.
Good thing that I am writing this review and not my husband.  He did not like his meal.  He got the tilapia special, with lemon and capers.  My husband said that fish was soggy with lemon juice, the broccoli limp and the rice dry.  My meal, on the other hand, was good.  I got the Cajun pasta sans sausage.  The waitress did not give me grief about leaving out the sausage.  I am a vegetarian that is trying to include some shellfish in the diet, so I allowed the shrimp.  They were a little overcooked, and frankly, I think that I would have enjoyed the meal even more without them.  The vegetables were tasty, and the sauce was spicy and delectable.  Yum!  Both meals came with a salad, and we both enjoyed the fresh greens and other vegetables.  Plus, the croutons were crunchy and flavorful.
My husband and I both enjoyed the intimate ambiance and will return."}
{"text":"I was eager to check this place out after all the great reviews I read!

When I first stepped foot inside Fenwick's I thought I was stepping onto the set of a horror movie...dimly lit (even though it was bright and sunny outside), long and narrow (almost like a trailer home had been converted into a restaurant), the dingy decor, wall colors and carpet, small bar right as you walk in, waitresses named \"Flowe\" and \"Bertha\" and the feel that everyone is staring at you as soon as you walk in.  Sooo....that was my first impression....

As we were seated we noticed the restaurant was very warm but they had a huge fan at the back where we were sitting so that helped a little.  The waitress was friendly but also that typical \"TV waitress\" where you would have expected her to say \"whatareyougonna have?\"  I quickly realized that all these little quirks are what make this place so amazing.  It is not pretentious, they aren't trying to trick you into buying more than you should, they aren't there to create a special environment...they just are who they are and they are damn proud of the food they produce.  That is all that really matters after all.

I ordered the fresh peach pancakes.  They were awesome.  It was Catherine's homemade batter and the pancakes had little pieces of peach in them.  It was served with strawberry butter and a side of meat.  They were awesome.  They were thin and you got 3 so I was satisfied but not overly bloated.

My friend got another special of the day which was basically an egg puff.  It was similar to a souffle...it was egg stuffed with goat cheese, spinach, tomatoes, peppers, etc.  It was served with fresh fruit, cheesy grits, and homemade walnut cinnamon coffee cake.  Perfection!  Trust me, I stole a few bites and it was all incredible!!

Price-wise I wouldn't say that the prices are super reasonable but they were ok for the amount of food and quality I suppose.  My pancakes were $12 and the egg puff meal was around $14...not bad but not the best.  


Bottom line...I dig this place.  Furthermore, I will be back.  I get the sense they are consistent and won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Fenwick's is a true gem in Myers Park. After driving by Fenwick's for more then 15 years, I can truly say I cannot believe I waited this long.  
I was in the area recently and decided to check out their dinner menu, even though I hear the breakfast is great.  After walking in the door I was greeted by the friendliest servers in town.  The waitresses truly seem to enjoy their jobs, their customers and the food, because they definitely highlight their specials and favorite dishes.
My first visit I decided to try the Fried Shrimp Platter, which comes with soup or salad and a roll to start and two sides...a lot of food let me tell you.
The salad was a mix of greens, chopped carrots, cucumbers and tomatoes with your choice of dressing. So fresh and I loved the homemade ranch. As for the entrée, OMG so good. The shrimp were fried to perfection, with a light batter that was not greasy at all. I ordered the broccoli casserole and a baked potato, both great!  On my second visit I went with the Fenwick Burger with cheese, another excellent choice.
Fenwick's is small inside, with less then 15 tables and a long bar with several seats but the tables turn quickly, and I can say that the food doesn't show it.  The menu has a lot of options with dinner specials every night, typically 4-5 and a soup of the day.
From the service to the food, Fenwick's is a definite go to in my book.  Looking forward to checking out their breakfast and lunch menus soon!"}
{"text":"The quiche used to be great but the last visit was just ok. The fruit they served with it was frozen & looked terrible. This used to be our go to place on Sunday. Too expensive for sub par entrees."}
{"text":"We have driven by this restaurant many times, but have never managed to go inside. After reading great reviews about their brunch, we decided to pop in. 

Past reviews described the wait staff as rude and non-existent, however our waitress was rough around the edges and a quick whip. We really enjoyed the service at Fenwick's and also the food.

I had the classic egg breakfast with scrambled eggs, cheddar cheese, hash browns and a pancake. The toast that came with the meal was phenomenal along with the delicious pancake with strawberry butter. Kieran ordered the Sunday Special, which included a baked egg, pecan coffee cake and a fruit salad. He loved it, especially the coffee cake. 

We will definitely be back here for another Sunday brunch in the future."}
