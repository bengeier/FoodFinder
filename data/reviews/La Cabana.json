{"text":"The sangria had too much lime but the food was very good! The chips and guacamole were also quite good. The waiter/owner was very nice, too.

Toronto doesn't really have good Mexican restaurants but this is very close.

I'd come back here again."}
{"text":"Great place. Have gone on three separate occasions, always get the rassberry margarita and start with chips and salsa. 

The food  isn't that authentic or exciting, but the enchiladas are good enough for me; especially since it's a short walk from my house. Not necessarily the best Mexican in town but far from the worst. Service is speedy and very friendly. Will definitely become one of my go-to spots on the Danforth."}
{"text":"This place is super tasty. My favorite chips and salsa in town."}
{"text":"Met my girlfriend here for lunch yesterday.  She ordered a lunch special that consisted of a cheese enchilada, beans & rice and a chicken taco.  I ordered the asado de peurco.  
My girlfriend stated that the chicken was mushy and bland.  After one bite I knew we would not return because of the look on her face.  My dish was a bit salty for my taste.  1 star because the place was too dark for the lunch hour (what are you hiding???) and there was a leak on the floor coming from the bar area...AND I don't like to see my girlfriend frown when she eats...next..."}
{"text":"This place is good for a quick lunch. You get chips and salsa while you wait for your food. Once you place your order, the food comes out rather quickly and they tend to be prompt with bringing the bill. 

Their menu is large. They have all of the familiar dishes with the familiar (proteins/queso/salsas) served on: burritos,  tacos, tamales, chimichangas, fajitas etc. They have burgers, breakfast dishes, menudo, and even some regional specialties. I enjoy their Pollo entrées (tequila or Diablo chicken), but if you don't want to spend much, they also have lower priced lunch specials. 

At lunch time on a weekday, we never have to wait to be seated. This is a very casual restaurant (and kind of old looking inside) so if you're looking to impress a date,  you might to step it up a notch and look elsewhere. If you are just looking for good food, this is a decent place."}
{"text":"Anyone rating this 5 stars is absolutely nuts or works there or both. Service was horrible, margaritas tasted like cheap mix with virtually no tequila and the food itself was borderline inedible. There's a Taco Bell on Sardis North and you would be better off going there. I'm serious. This place is horrible."}
{"text":"It is hard to find decent Mexican in Toronto and this place is no exception. The decent reviews fooled us. The food was very bland. I've actually had better frozen dinners."}
{"text":"You don't go here for the ambiance but the food is all from scratch and excellent. It's a great value for very good Mexican food."}
{"text":"I went to La Cabana this past Friday night with a fairly large group of friends.
While the owner was very friendly, the decor unfortunately leaves much to be desied.
The fruit flies buzzing around were kinda yucky too.
On a positive note, the food was tasty and the beverages, especially the alcoholic ones, were very generous! ) I'd say the food/drink selection overall was pretty good.

Unfortunately, the food portions we're a little scarce and many of us left feeling not quite full or had to order a second dish halfway throughout our meals.

It was a decent little place."}
{"text":"I had lunch here when it first opened and it was great.  I have been back occasionally and the food is consistently authentic Mexican food and the wait staff take good care of you.  I have had Mexican food at other locations in Las Vegas, but  I think this place out  does the rest by far.  The prices are reasonable and they have a nice lunch menu.  I don't think you can go wrong with La Cabana."}
{"text":"Great tacos al pastor, just like they are traditionally made!  Highly recommend this small, homey restaurant. Great service every time."}
{"text":"Worse mexican food I have ever eaten. I ordered chimichungas and received a wet burrito. The rice was dry and had no flavor as did the salsa. I asked for the manager, and she couldn't be bothered to come see me and kept sending messages thru the serever. If your looking for authentic mexican food, i suggest you go elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!!! I went in Oct. 2010 - having just returned from San Fran where you can find real authentic Mexican food at every corner, I didn't have very high expectations. BUT - the food was even better than anything I had tasted States side!! 

The portions were perfect (not huge not small). They make heir own salsa. I had the beef chimichanga - it was soooo delicious!! The daiquiris were amazing (margaritas too but I'm not a tequila fan) - they'll even mix flavours for you - I think I had strawberry coconut. 

Service was great too. Very friendly. The decor wasn't anything special but don't let that deter you from delicious food and a great experience!!"}
{"text":"The freezing cold weather in Toronto makes me wish I was in Tulum, Playa del Carmen or Cozumel, México.  No time to escape to the Yucatan.  So I thought of the next best thing, jaunting around México via La Cabana.

Service was excellent here.  A friendly, cheery and outgoing Mexican guy made us feel right at home.

The menu featured everyone's Mexican favorite dishes:  Guacamole, Nachos, Burrito, Pozole, Quesadilla, Enchilada, Chimichanga and Fajita.

The Botanas, Guacamole La Cabana was okay for us.  We were hoping for guacamole with a bit more of a kick

My Wingman ordered today's special, Asado de Cerdo.  Stewed pork marinated with guajillo pepper and spices.  He was kind enough to share it with all of us.  I loved the guajillo pepper blend sauce, which complimented the pork nicely.  If the pork was more tender, this dish would be even more tasty.

Flautas de Pollo, this golden fried corn tortilla with chicken was quite substantial, well presented, but lacked flavor.

I, on the other hand, was looking for a dish that would take me closest to Méxican beaches.  Mariscos Acapolco seemed like the perfect choice.  The broth was decent with a good amount of mixed seafood.  But the ranchero sauce based dish with overcooked seafood left me half-way to Acapolco.

Overall, La Cabana is a respectable Méxican restaurant.  Decent food with fantastic service."}
{"text":"This place was amazing!! We love Mexican food and this is the best I have found in Charlotte. The chips and salsa were great. The table side guacamole was delicious. They had $3.95 margaritas when we were there which was great.. My wife had the fajita burrito and she said it was one of the best has ever had. We cannot wait to go back and have dinner again. I know good authentic Mexican and this place is tops."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a cold and windy Saturday afternoon. We were the only ones in there, but that didn't bother us. I guess it was the owner that served us, who was very welcoming and friendly. Made us feel like we were at home.

The restaurant was a bit cold, but I'm sure it warms up at night when there are more people eating there. The atmosphere was cozy, cafe style with mexican music playing in the background. 

We ordered the chicken tacos la cabana and the bistek ranchero. Both were delicious and offered plenty of food. My only complaint is that I wish there was a bit more spice. 

The sangrias were awesome, came in a big glass with fresh fruit. 

It was a bit pricey, but I would like to come back again, this time at night, and save some room for dessert. :)"}
{"text":"I have been hear a couple of times of lunch and have enjoyed every visit.  Friendly, prompt service with tasty chips and salsa to start.  You can also ask for bean dip. I love there #10 (I think and will correct if wrong)  a delicious breast served in a tasty garlic sauce."}
{"text":"Great little place for lunch. Lunch specials are under $10. Neighborhood is a little sketchy, but the food isn't bad. I had the garlic chicken, it had great flavor but was a little dry. Definitely not a fancy place. If you went in looking homeless, nobody would bat an eye"}
{"text":"we ordered food from my job yesterday and the food was so good .it was very stressed and delivered in about 20 to 25 minutes I was very impressed .the only thing I would do differently is next time I'll get the hot habanero sauce I need a little more spice .thank you from the staff at valley hospital ."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to it, place is closed. Thought folks should know before they get as excited as I did."}
{"text":"I work nearby and didn't even know this place existed until a co-worker pointed it out to me yesterday and asked if I had been there. I'm glad he did because this place is a pretty nice lunch spot. Service is fast here and were continuously receiving refills on water, chips and salsa during our meal. I wasn't sure what to get and opted for a supreme carnitas burrito w/ green sauce. It was a ton larger than what I was expecting and was very filling, as they were generous with the meat, beans and rice inside the burrito. The carnitas pork was chopped and moist, which I liked...some places do carnitas shredded or fried, which I don't like as much. Will definitely be keeping this place in mind in the future when going out to lunch near the office."}
{"text":"Just a small hole in the wall place but it was delicious and the service was also great! Will return!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch! 

You're not paying for atmosphere, but great service and good food! 

My business partner and I stopped in for some soup. She ordered the Tortilla, I ordered the Albondigas.
The Albondigas, had 3 large meatballs, but chunks of vegetables in a nice tomato broth. 

We also split the mexican shrimp cocktail. One of my favories, shrimp, cucumber, pico de gallo and avocado emerged in a sweet tangy tomato sauce. Will definitely order again on my next visit."}
{"text":"Place is now closed-   The service was excellent.   The chips were fine, salsa ok.   I had chicken mole. I would rate it as better than average.   My date had enchiladas suizas.  They were not the best I've had.   We had a long island iced tea which was very good.  Overall, this place is ok.  I wouldn't rate it better than Azteca."}
{"text":"It is with the deepest disappointment, sadness, and regret that I announce that La Cabana has closed. 

I think Eduardo had the restaurant for 12 years. Another little guy bites the dust. So sad."}
{"text":"I think I'm missing something that the other Yelpers are all talking about: this place was horrible! 

Everything except for the chips (which we had to order while everyone else got a basket for free by the way) were the best tasting things we had for dinner since everything else was bland and boring. Plus the service was pretty slow. Its a shame because I was really hankering for some authentic style Mexican after returning home from my trip to the Mayan Riviera. 

I'm not sure if it was just an off day, but I really have no desire to check this place out a second time."}
{"text":"Ay, Caramba!  That's one of my extremely limited Spanish vocabulary, the rest being Food related names.  At least that's what I thought while I got up to research the small blackboard on the wall with the specials-of-the-day.  The likes of Carne Asada, Tacos Al Pastor and my selection of Asado de Cerdo.  Nice of them to put the detailed description along with the dish names but the lone friendly Gentleman server would be glad to explain as he noted to me in advance.   2.5 *star*

There was a bit of Mexican colors to the dining space with a couple Sombreros to give it slightly more themed in comparison to the psychotic colored plastic plates used for sharing Tapas which could have been perfect for Children's Piñata Parties.

Spicy Condiments arrive at your table as you sit and this is one of the KEYS to a better meal here.  Most items will lack the spices and it will be self-adjusted by the given Green Sauce.  No doubt it had a good SEAR on my tongue.  Good for melting the snow outside rather than the Salt on roads preserving my car like a Bacalhau Salt Fish.

Guacamole la Cabana  -  While I like the Tortilla Chip selection better than those Nachos that come with your normal Nachos Platters at a typical Sports Bar or Pub, the Guacamole lacked seasoning and ingredients which made it more of plain Mash Avocado instead.

Camarones Picantes  -  This was supposedly the spiciest of the three Shrimp Tapas dishes from the list but again needed to add that killer Green Spicy Sauce.  I guess Picante here is more like False Advertising.  2nd Miss!

Asado de Cerdo  -  Guajillo Pepper Stewed Pork w/Herbs & Spices.  I enjoyed this Stew Pork served with Rice, Frijoles & Tortillas.  Much more enjoyable than the other Chicken dishes my dinnermates chose.  It still lack that spicy heat but at minimum the sauce with the Pork gave some depth of flavour FINALLY!"}
{"text":"The service here is warm and friendly, but the food really is run of the mill. The one-star rating applies only to the food, which really is bland. They don't make their own chips and their refried beans taste like they are from a can. Just can't recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is like so many funky little places tucked away in a small shopping center.
We happened in here, on our way to meet some friends for cocktails. Deciding we wanted to have quick bite before.

The interior could use a little love, but has all the charm of a cute little place.

Even though the dining room was busy, I felt very taken care of by the waitress,
I ordered the cheese enchilada with green sauce.It came out hot and tasty. 
And the menu is not expensive, even the seafood dishes which I saw coming out of the kitchen. And they looked really good!

I would go back! Would I travel across town to go, not so sure about that. Would I suggest it after a day of Outlet Shopping?? HELL'YA!"}
{"text":"Very tasty.  Decent lunch specials.  Not a ton of food and not the cheapest, but it tastes really good.  And the service is good as well."}
{"text":"Service was quick! Chips, salsa, and steaming-hot cheese dip was delicious! My date had enchiladas and the mole was dark and rich. My torta was the best I've ever had. I think I've found a new favorite Mexican spot!"}
{"text":"Given the location, you might not expect much, but will be pleasantly surprised upon entry. The atmosphere puts off a real authentic vibe. The food is decent and the prices are in line with similiar establishments. I chose the beef chimichanga from the list of lunch specials. If I remember correctly, the price was $6.95 plus a beverage. The lunch specials are offered with rice and beans. I opted for all beans and no rice. I think all the waitress heard was \"no rice.\" I received it as ordered. No rice and No extra beans. Next time I'll order \"no arroz. doble frijoles.\"  The chimichanga was actually quite tasty, but not very large. The service was fast and friendly enough, complete with plenty of chips and salsa. The salsa was great, however, the chips were cold. Good, but cold. This wasn't some place I would drive out of the way for, but would visit again. Overall, it was ok. Nothing to prompt an extra star, but also nothing to be too disappointed about either."}
{"text":"This is one of my go-to spots for quick, consistent Mexican food. It may not look like much from the outside or inside for that matter, but don't let looks deceive you. 

I've been going here for lunch for over a decade and they are always quick to seat, serve, refill and get you your check in lightening speed. 

During lunch I never have to wait for a seat. The owner always walks around and chats with the patrons. I see many of the same folks each time I go. It feels like home to me... comfortable, casual, and good food.

My favorite is their salsa... it's sooo good!

Rumor has it they are moving to a new location next year. I look forward to their new home...as long as they stick close by and promise to not change the food!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  On the cheaper end, very good food.  Sometimes it takes a while, but it is worth it."}
{"text":"I'm keeping this short, due to the fact that  all I had was a carne asada burrito.
-rice was ok, pretty bland
-beans were good, just salty
-carne asada was good, also salty. 

I would have ordered again from this restaurant since it's close to work, and they deliver until.....
I got food poisoning!!! Unfortunately I still haven't fully recovered and feel nauseous everytime I eat something. I wish I could give negative stars, instead I'll NEVER eat here again, and would urge the same to anyone reading unless you'd like to lose 5-10 lbs in a week."}
{"text":"My favorite mexican restaurant.  I first went to a corporate lunch here and since then I've been hooked. They deliver too! Which is a huge plus, my schedule can be busy. My favorite item is their crispy fish tacos.  Seriously best in town! And last but not least the service is attentive and very kind.  If i could do 6 stars I would!"}
{"text":"Service was not very good and the food was just okay. 

Our cokes were incredibly flat, and when we asked about it we just got a blank stare. And he said he didn't drink coke. And walked away. Eventually he came back with new ones from the bar instead of the kitchen, but we were really confused about what was going on. 

My order came out wrong and everyone kept blaming each other without every really correcting the problem. The waiter said it was the kitchen, then the owner came over and said it was the waiter's fault, then the waiter came back and offered a 12% discount because it wasn't really \"their\" fault, it was the kitchen's fault. Ummm....shouldn't a restaurant all be one unit? I just wanted to eat. I ordered Pechugo la Mexicana, which on the menu says grilled chicken with peppers and onions covered with cheese sauce. I got a soupy mixture of chicken with minced peppers and onions in a spicy red sauce. They kept debating the interpretation of the menu. I won't be back.

Also, to be fair they are newly Mexican. Apparently it used to be a Korean BBQ spot and they just transitioned to Mexican fare. Still some kinks to work out for sure."}
{"text":"Since Acapulco is where I want to be in the winter I was on a mission to find an authentic Mexican restaurant!

I Found this restaurant from a coupon in the entertainment book and was searching for a Mexican restaurant, this is the only option that showed up so we decided to try it. 

It is a family run restaurant, very nice people, it was authentic Mexican food with lots of flavor.

The Mexican salad was very tasty, very delicious but also very small portioned. The chicken fajitas were excellent as was the deep fried ice cream.

The prices are also very reasonable, I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"great food, I had the calamari with some sauce with a mango daiquiri  and my friend had the enchiladas. The owner is very nice and attentive, but he gives you lots of space. The atmosphere was good with some nice Latin music in the background and dim lighting. Food and service was good, pretty cheap too, we both got drinks(alcoholic) and a meal and it was $37. I will go back for sure

(it may not be authentic but its damn good.)"}
{"text":"The service and food Were amazing I recommend this place to anybody that wants some good Mexican food"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. I can eat three entire baskets of their chops and salsa, definitely the best in town. I live all the way in Centennial Hills and don't mind driving down just for the chips. The service is awesome, super quick and very friendly. The owner is a great guy too! Try the breakfast burrito or chilaquiles for breakfast, and the carne asana burrito for lunch! Yum!"}
{"text":"It's a bit deceiving when you see the misspelled banner on the building, but the food is decent. Upon sitting, we were immediately served with chips and salsa. It wasn't bad, but I've had better. The fajitas were mighty tasty. I didn't even try the beans, but the rice was mediocre. Worth going back but not going out of my way...."}
{"text":"Is this the best Mexican food in town?  Definitely not, but it's super cheap and pretty tasty.  

This is the only halfway decent restaurant close to my office, so I am a regular here.  Service is also friendly and fast.  The chips and salsa are pretty solid and the lunch specials will fill you up and not break the bank.  I highly recommend the #5 Chile Verde Burrito plate which comes with refried beans and rice.  I've also tried the adobada taco and it's pretty good, although not as good as Tacos El Gordo.  This is truly weird, but I really love the water at this place.  Yeah, I said water.  None of that funky aftertaste like some places."}
{"text":"I am not overly impressed by La Cabana.  I ordered a lunch special consisting of a shredded beef soft shelled taco, two pork tamales, rice and beans.  The taco had good enough flavor but the shell was soggy from sitting in a foam box and basically steaming in its own juices.  The tamales had the right meat to masa ratio but was a bit bland.  The red sauce was almost paste-y.  Some more spice and some more salt would have been a nice touch.  The rice, on the other hand, had too much salt for my liking.  I almost always eat all of my rice from a Mexican restaurant.  Not today.  And the refried beans I don't think were cooked all the way through.  I found a couple of crunchy beans and so I did not finish them.  If there is a silver lining to that gassy cloud it is that the beans were almost obviously homemade.  I don't know the last time I found crunchy beans in a can.  At $10 for this meal, I am disappointed. I don't know that I will be back.  But at least I gave La Cabana a try.  It was a welcome change to the limited fast food I have grown so tired of."}
{"text":"This place is a definite diamond in the rough, tucked away in a dying strip mall next to the interstate. 
I stopped by looking for a quick cheap meal and was pleasantly surprised. 
The ambience and the service was good. This place seems popular for lunch with more than 7 full tables. The chips were so-so (flour?), but the salsa was good. 
I had the tacos al pastor which were good.
I definitely like the prices. This place is a keeper if I have to work around this area again."}
{"text":"This place beats my old favorite in downtown Matthews (El Valle).  Great good with unmatched customer service.  Even the owners came out and asked what we thought about the food.  $2 Blue Moons on special, salsa was the best I've ever had, supreme nachos were awesome.  Wife had the fajitas and loved them.  Plenty of open seating available, nice set up, give this place a try."}
{"text":"My partner and I moved here from texas 6 months ago and thought we would never find good mexican food.  We were happily surprised when we found La Cabana.  The place is clean and cozy...and serves up real mexican food with a flair.  The only sad part is that they do not make their own chips or tortillas.  When dining you will probably be waited on by the owner or his niece...both extremely personable.  My favorite dish is the fajitas...but they are more like carne guisada that real fajitas."}
{"text":"While at work we sometimes order from here and they deliver to us.  A couple of co workers have complained that after eating the food they have experienced upset stomachs.  Ive ordered from here several times and never had a problem up until recently.  I ordered the shredded beef taquitos and a tamale.  The taquitos were really good,  the tamale was a little dry.  Unfortunately that night, and through the wee hours of the next morning I threw up.  I felt the effects of that lunch for two days. Needless to say i won't be ordering from here again.  Its a shame because the food tasted pretty good and they were close to my work."}
{"text":"Best tortilla soup I've ever had. I now try to go weekly. Staff are friendly and remember returning customers. Carry out and online orders are also accepted. But delivery can be slow."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food I've ever had! I literally have to drive across town to eat there! Great food and service!"}
{"text":"I'll keep it short. I stopped by while I was on lunch and the food was great. They make their own chips and salsa and they were delicious. Ordered a carne asada burrito, the food was great and it was very cheap. I found out they deliver too. Ill be ordering from this place a lot I recomend to give it a shot!!!"}
{"text":"My coupon-fanatic friend and I decided to come here to try the place since we get 50%.  I forgot what I even ordered but I remember not being impressed. But at least I was not horrified. There are some restaurants where you just want to run out to the street after tasting their food. This isn't one of those. 

The ambience, though, was nice and the server was good. The place is clean (very important) and cozy.

Will I ever come back? Maybe. If I find another coupon."}
{"text":"La Cabana was voted best place to get lunch for under $10 by the Review Journal's \"Best of Las Vegas\". La Cabana gets a solid three stars - not overly impressed but not disappointed either. This small restaurant is located right next to a UMC and Clark County's Social Services. I was in the area and chose La Cabana because it was the closest eatery that popped up in the Yelp's app search bar. 

BREAKFAST BURRITO ($7.95): Comes with a side of beans and rice. The burrito has eggs, hashbrowns, onion, cilantro and cheese. Of course I said hold the onions! Overall, a tasty burrito. 3.5/5 Rice was better than most I've had at Mexican restaurants and the refried beans were average. 

SERVICE: La Cabana's was real busy at 12PM on a Tuesday. I had to stand awkwardly by my lonesome for about 2 minutes before I was seated. Servers aren't ones to chat or smile, but they're efficient! 3/5

COMPLIMENTARY CHIPS AND SALSA: Chips were a bit crunchy and the salsa was boring. I only ate like 3 chips, which is unusual since I usually eat the whole basket! 2/5 

Random tid bit: I second Heather H.'s opinion that the water tastes good here!

Worth a Return Visit?
This isn't in my neck of the woods, so probably not.

{"text":"Great service, variety and authentic Mexican. Lunch specials rock!  Fills the hunger hole for lunch. Breakfast chilaquiles and machaca were great yesterday!"}
{"text":"Going to La Cabana is a last minute decision since we cannot secure a reservation for Frida and my fellow friends want to have Mexican food. 

I have never been to a Mexican restaurant outside of Mexico... so coming La Cabana with no expectations... but I left with disappointment.... 

Our waiter is one of the most friendly Mexican waiters I ever met and I don't have to speak Spanish to him... that is a plus. Services here was friendly and excellent.... 3 stars

Now to the food...... Seriously, La Cabana really have to work on improving the quality of the food. 

Most of the food here does not have the intense taste, freshness and seasonings of the Mexican dishes I ate before... 

The chicken I ordered tasted like something I made at home with a jar of Mexican sauce I can get from the supermarket... and the Shrimp Tapas we ordered are so pathetic which I said is tasteless!!

Luckily the spicy Jalapeno sauce which I requested after tasting the other red coloured unflavoured sauce saved the day... it gave a good kick of everything I ate... 

I asked the waiter why none of the dishes are really spicy up like the authentic dishes, he did comment that most people cannot take the heat..... hmmm??"}
{"text":"Mexican food gone bad....I used to patronize this establishment years ago and it was always consistent and a decent lunch. Times have changed. I was really disappointed. 

My lunch was pretty basic and it consisted of two
chicken enchiladas with beans and rice. It took an extremely loooooooong time to receive the food which I thought was unusual. I looked around a couple of times and there was not that many people dining with us. When the food finally arrived, I was a
bit surprised. How hard can it be to make tasty enchiladas? The sauce was really bland and virtually had no flavor. The chicken didn't appear to have been seasoned. In the past my meals were not amazing but not as bad as this particular lunch. 

I understand with the Neon project taking place that they are going to move from this location. I am hopeful that the new location will warrant better food and more stars! 

I have to say that although it took forever to receive my order, the service was still really good and this is the reason for the third star."}
{"text":"As with many others in the city, my search for good Mexican always falls short. The other issue is that most of the well received Mexican restaurants are in the west end of the city. La Cabana is an amazing option in the East end (and the entire city).

The service and hospitality of the place is always warm. We are usually greeted by Eduardo (owner) and he is always in a pleasant mood. I have tried several of the popular menu items:
-Tortillas and guac: absolutely amazing, perfect blend of seasoning and and underlying cilantro flavour
-Shrimps with salsa verde: Shrimps came out tender to perfection (I was able to pull the shrimp out of its tail perfectly using just a fork. The sauce is not too spicy, allowing you to taste all the flavours.
-Chicken burrito: simple, but yummy. Shredded chicken seasoned perfectly and refried bean sauce
-Chicken Enchilada: Simply amazing (doesn't come out too spicy which is fine for me. I'm a spice lover so I just season to taste with their homemade hot sauce. If you are really adventurous, try their special habanaro hot sauce)
-Veggie Enchilada: usually veggie options at Mexican places are sad. It usually means just some fried onions and peppers -this included that and more - eggplant, zuchinni. Delicious and hearty.

In conclusion, the is overwhelmingly going to be my go-to mexican joint. Prices are quite reasonable. $70 (plus tip) for 2 people for all of the above, plus a HUGE pitcher of sangria."}
{"text":"I love this place . I'm love the Spanish rice, in my opinion best in town, and believe my I'm really picky. The chips and salsa are amazing too. I also love the owner he is such a great host a very humble guy. Go here you will love promise."}
{"text":"Tasty dinner tonight as always.  Great homemade-style Mexican food....and always served with such a pleasant demeanor."}
