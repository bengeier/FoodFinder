{"text":"I had a plate size serving of rice, veggies and a mixture of half steak half chicken. Awesome. Huge portion. Great value. Left full and satisfied."}
{"text":"I ate at Flame Broiler consistently in Orange County, and I'm happy to see they are located in the Tempe area on my way home from work.  The food is fresh, tastes great, and it is healthy.  I generally get a half and half bowl with all veggies, no rice.  The problem I have with the location on Broadway is they are very skimpy on filling up the bowl with vegetables.  The meat is portioned well, but the two times I've eaten there they are not using enough vegetables to fill up the bowl.  in Orange County the bowls were always full."}
{"text":"I remember eating at Flame broiler in California, so the quality of the food at the Tempe location was pretty consistent. Good alternative when you're not feeling a burger/fries or Mexican food. I wish they had drained the veggies before putting them in my bowl. I ended up with a soggy ricey mess 3/4 of the way down the bowl."}
{"text":"A friend and I decided to venture off to lunch and see what this place was about. We both agreed that we were pleasantly surprised. It's fairly a simple meal with rice, veggies, and choice of meat. We both tried the combo (chicken & steak) and it was really good! They have a bowl combo with drink for only $7.99. I got the plate, which just had more protein in its serving. Can't wait to go back and give it another try!"}
{"text":"After eating dinner at Blaze Pizza we were given a sample of Flame Bolier Chicken, and Beef. We immediately went inside to get a to go order for lunch today. I am eating my reheated Flame Bolier for lunch and it's just as amazing as last night! I am excited to introduce this new place to my family. Thanks for the amazing food!!!"}
{"text":"Food is really good and the manager was extremely nice! It's kind of tucked away next to the I17, but I have to say for the price it's a steal. If you're like me and try to find a healthy protein filled meal when you eat out, this is the place! It's Asian BBQ and has a good cuts of meat!"}
{"text":"I have heard lots of good things about this place so I was pleasantly pleased when one opened up right next to me. I first went on my lunch break from work. It was very busy but they moved quickly. I was in and out. Food was great and the staff is friendly. I have a feeling I'll be a regular."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch it was busy probly had 15 people in front of me .The 2 girls who work there tianna and Jesse are half woman half amazing. I was only there for only 15 minutes. These girls are some hard workers. I'm very rarely impressed .I got my food to go and when I got home everything was perfect and delicious. these girls need a raise. Very impressed! I will definitely be back.."}
{"text":"MY GF AND I WORKED HERE**
Insiders to flame broiler:
My girlfriend and I were both managers here for about 6 months and we are going to explain why you should never go and the countless reasons why we left.

HEALTH ISSUES:
-Employees don't wash their hands (My GF & I were the only ones & maybe one other employee but it was occasionally
-They put their hands in the rice to mix it (they don't wash their hands unless being reminded - we have both seen this pretty much every time
-They didn't properly wash dishes (we ALWAYS had to re-wash dishes) 


MANAGERS
Kevin (owner - not in state) - did not stop/resolve any issues 
-He also thinks he cooks the chicken the best and we think it's hilarious because we get complaints about his chicken every time he's there cooking!!
-Treats employees crappy
--was told by ME that another manager (24-26 I don't really remember or care, but too old for what you're about to read) was watching PORN with 16 year olds - AH! EW! OMG!
Rafael (manager of 3 locations)
-was also told by me that the manager was watching porn with the high schoolers
The 16 year olds told me it was pure closing with me because we didn't have dirty conversations and watch porn - if I was their parents, I would SUE! 
I told him this and nothing was done. This manager only got a write up for making people take him to petco on the clock.

I had many issues with employees not listening, being rude to customers, stealing from the tip jar and so much more, I came to Rafael and told him he should try and hire older and choose a little wiser with the applications - considering every time he was doing them or any thing else in the office, he has to ask my gf and I for help - he didn't take my advice lol.

My gf and I sent Rafael a picture of nasty meat that was NOT edible and he still said to cook it (we tossed that crap out, I'm sure there was mold on it - it had been sitting out the bag open and everything)
The avocados are 1.50 for half - we had nasty small brown ones that were just gross and we were still forced to sell them (we threw most of them out)

EMPLOYEES
-DRAMA
-Disrespectful high schoolers
-Don't do anything/just sit on their phone
(We had one druggie employee who snorted it up in our bathroom and took like 10 smoke breaks) 
-They are constantly losing employees (the good ones who realize how crappy of a place it is really quick) 

My girlfriend and I were typically the \"morning crew\" and people would always come in and tell us they love coming in the morning because we were always nice and we always got their orders right and if something happened during the night crew (who we always had complains about - probably because it was ran by the porn manager), we ALWAYS fixed it and hooked them up! 
Good customer service is what brings people back and makes people's day - we need more people like that!!

Most of these things listed are still happening, my girlfriend and I were the only ones keeping people working proper and giving great customer service. 

The only reason why we stayed at this place was our lease was almost up and we needed the extra money until we moved. 

It's not worth the money"}
{"text":"Everything about this restaurant is mediocre. Small portion sizes, over cooked food and terrible customer service. Every time we are in there it is empty, yet it still takes over 15 minutes to get our food! The grill chef acts like he doesn't want to be there and cooks food at his leisure. Not sure I will ever return."}
{"text":"I got a flyer for this place while grocery shopping last week.  I worked late last night and drove by and figured I would stop by for dinner.  

I did not have a lot of time to look at the menu.  I asked for the basics and the young lady ran me through it.  I got brown rice with veggies.  I sampled the chicken and beef.  I chose the beef.  I did not see any sides on the menu when I glanced over it.  I got my bowl and the lady explained the sauces.  I chose their basic one and it was good.  The only thing is that I must have put to much on.  I made it a little to salty.  It was good though.  Next time I will cut back on the sauce.  

Overall the food is excellent and it is close to my house.  I will be back and recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Quick, good food and decently priced. Steak and chicken are both equally good. Top with green onions, avocado and magic sauce/hot sauce mix."}
{"text":"This is clearly not the same quality of food as in the previous version of this restaurant in Tempe. First off, you have some dimwit teenager texting behind the counter as I walk inside and he was the damn cook. The other worker was in the bathroom and she was pretty unwelcoming as well. They used to have large chunks of white meat chicken, but now the $1.50 white meat upcharge is just tiny pieces of chicken cooked in the magic sauce and dumped on top of rice. The veggies were different too - they seemed frozen, not fresh. The place is nice and neat with hot sauces now and no limit on that magic sauce stuff, but nothing ever stays the same and I have made my final visit to the Flame Broiler - RIP."}
{"text":"I am so thrilled they opened a Flame Broiler around this area. I've gone here 3 times over the course of 2 weeks and I am never tired of the food! It's simple, healthy and delicious! You start by picking your portion size then a base of your choice:

-Brown/White Rice
-Veggies
-Veggies and Rice*
-Salad 

After picking a base, you then move on to choose what type of protein you like. They offer:

-Chicken
-Beef
-Half Chicken/Half Beef*
-Organic Tofu 

Once this step is done, they'll ask if you want to top it off with green onions / avocado. And Voila! You have your super simple, healthy meal. Don't forget to try the sauces they offer on the side. They are really good and goes well with the entree. The items with a (*) are what I recommend!"}
{"text":"My sister and brother-in-law have been a fan of Flame Broiler for quite some time. Until recently the nearest location was in flagstaff. When they heard a new location was opening near by they were super excited. Walking into the restaurant the inside looks good with the green walls. Some posters are decorating the inside talking about healthy stuff. The store is super clean. I was very impressed by that.

The food is really good, healthy and filling. I love how they cook their meat. You get a little bit of a smokey flavor. I like all of the different sauces that they have. It seems like the magic sauce is everyone's favorite but they also have some spicier sauces and buffalo sauce.

Their employees are nice and the service is fast. They really got things figured out here.

I am now a big fan of Flame Broiler! Everyone should come check this place out!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place for quick food! Tried it on a whim and was pleasantly surprised. The staff is super friendly, and the food is simple and honest. The menu is basic (like In-N-Out) and everything is delicious. The meat is fire grilled, and has a backyard BBQ flavor rather than corporate fast food. The sauces are unexpected and delicious. I'm glad they moved into the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Growing up in Southern California, Flame Broiler has always been a staple and when I saw that a new one was opening up in North Phoenix I was ecstatic. I went in the day it opened(and I know grand openings can be a bit nerve racking for new businesses) and was happy to see the same, if not better menu than I grew up with. The ordering style is also like chipotle, like you see your food in front of you. I ordered a half and half bowl and the food did not disappoint, however when I was ordering the lady looked at me confused, like she didn't know that it was on the menu or was confused. Also, for like 70% of my order the manager/supervisor was hovering over the employee putting my food into the bowl and he was micromanaging, like he didn't trust his employees and it made me feel very uncomfortable and I left feeling like I was a nuisance. Because he wasn't training them, it was almost like he was frustrated and lecturing them, which you do not do in front of your customers .  So I can only hope that those who are managing these employees begin to trust them more and utilize constructive means of assisting them."}
{"text":"Love this place. Anytime I'm in flagstaff I eat there so I was excited to learn one was coming to the valley! Close to my job and one of the few healthier options around. (Sub sandwiches get tiring) lol I've only had the chicken with white rice and veggies. The sauces (magic, green, and hot sauce) are pretty good and definitely listen to it when it says hot. Everyone is always super friendly and helpful. Great staff and fast service!"}
{"text":"I don't like this place - I absolutely LOVE this place!  I've never had a bad experience here. The food is absolutely excellent, the employees are so nice and it's normally quick and easy to get in and out even when the line is out the door. Don't forget the magic sauce - yum!"}
{"text":"The food was good but...
I have been to a lot of rice bowl places and never seen one with a scale on the line. I ordered the half and half (half chicken, half beef) bowl over white rice. The bowl was loaded with rice and then a scoop of veggies and then it was placed on the scale. The meat was then slowly added to the bowl to the point where it was eventually little piece by little piece to make sure the weight was right. I understand they are trying to consistent and cost conscious but it came across as stingy. With a coupon I would go back as $8 was a bit much for what I got considering it was mostly rice.

The place itself is clean and bright. The menu is clear and easy to understand to make ordering easy. Decent selection of sauces. The staff really didn't interact with me other than asking if I snagged onions."}
{"text":"Great food quick service and a staff that gets the food out plz give it a try healthy  and full of flavor"}
{"text":"If you enjoy paying a lot for just rice, you've come to the right place. They put your food on a scale, right in front of you, and won't even give you a full scoop of whatever meat you order. I've been to enough flamebroilers and I have been served a respectable amount of steak, chicken, etc. Not to mention the food is already expensive, $8 for a half and half bowl. You would figure they could give you a respectable amount of meat. This place is a joke though. Twice I've finished my bowl with a good amount of rice and no meat. The food is the same quality as any other flamebroiler, but the service is seriously lacking."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: This is not a burger place like the name suggests.  The closest thing I can say about this place is, a less um, fancy version of Panda Express.  It's alright, not the greatest selections of choices, but I did not go hungry.  I had the mini bowl with white rice and broiled chicken.  Not too bad."}
{"text":"Hard choice being next to a smashburger, fried pie, and cafe rio. Gave it a try, not disappointed.  Place was empty, at lunch time, but it was early lunch time, so didn't make a judgement. Regular bowl with white rice and veggies and chicken. Wish they had more variety of veggies. The kicker for me was the sauce, love being able to get as much, or little, as possible. I will come back."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a quick (and healthy!) bite, Flame Broiler is for you. The hubby and I go to a lot of Coyotes games and have to hurry after work for a meal before we get to the game. We had a bogo coupon and each tried a bowl. I had the chicken, he had 50/50 (beef/chicken). You get to choose your rice and veggies. They have a few salsas to choose from. The food was flavorful and if you purchase one of their plastic cups you can bring it back for .50 refills! (Great for the environment AND wallet. Win!) 
No frills but reasonably priced and tasty. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Big fan. Simple ingredients and fast service. Highly recommend for a quick lunch or catering your next office meeting."}
{"text":"In my opinion they are over priced. My mini bowl and soda came to $9. I do appreciate the option of forgoing rice and just getting veggies as my base, but the white meat was really dry and tough. 

They served me the very bottom of the barrel veggies, which is never appetizing. New guy might not have known to yell for new pan of veggies. Owner should be watching over a little closer. 

If I come back I'll try the beef. I do like the convenience factor that this business offers and let's face it....it's not cheap to eat healthy."}
{"text":"Service is amazing. Food is delicious. I got the half and half with brown rice and veggies. Amazing. Perfect pick me up. Would eat here again."}
{"text":"Really good food I love how healthy everything is. The steak and chicken combo is awesome"}
{"text":"Driving around on a Friday afternoon on my permanent day off from work. Now that I have extra time on my hands I can actually go visit a newer local good spot in the Moon valley area. Located on a newer development plaza on the north side of Bell  Road. Coming in on a Friday at noon ideal as I didn't have any lines to wait on! I luckily had a coupon to where I ordered two mini bowls with brown rice. One topped with chicken and the other steak strips. To include the meal I had two cups of ice tea all for the price of $10! The two young ladies that served were very pleasant and If you try the sauces please try the magic sauce ! Delicious!"}
{"text":"This is a newer business close to a business district in the phoenix/Tempe border. The food line is very simple with options of chicken, meat or veggie bowl to compliment brown or white rice . Also have the option of these sauces."}
{"text":"Ok my new favorite spot!! So good and fresh! The meat was not over cooked like some tend to be and the vegetables were not all soggy but had a nice little crunch. A must try!!"}
{"text":"Friendly service with delicious and nutritious food. I like how you can add your own sauce later. Don't forget to ask for their loyalty card if you are a frequent customer."}
{"text":"Alright friends, I actually just randomly fell into this place around lunchtime. I zoomed in to get a Starbucks next door and there it was! Outside of building advertises healthy bowls. It's an order at counter type deal like a Chipotle. Go in and you get a choice of white or brown rice- with or without mixed steamed veggies and a protein: chicken, beef or tofu (you can even do a half and half mix of proteins). That's it! That simple! Service is quick. I got the tofu bowl with brown rice, veggies and avocado. They do not keep tofu on the line so it took longer for them to cook it but worth the wait. The tofu was cooked perfectly and fresh. Vegetables and rice all right on the mark. If you are wondering the clientele the line was long but moves fast and it's a mix of everyone! Just goes to show you healthy food does not have a type.

I would definitely check this place out for an alternative to a heavy lunch sandwich."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good. Marinated grilled chicken, steak or tofu on top of your choice of rice and/or vegetables. You can even make it into a salad if you prefer. For a little more you can have white meat only. A sauce bar lets you pick from five different sauces to add. I'm gluten free and was able to eat here by asking them to grill white chicken without adding the marinade. Great, healthy, well priced fast food. I got the mini and it was filled to the brim."}
{"text":"Brand new restaurant in North Phoenix! The prices are reasonable and there are 3 different portion sizes you can choose from. The menu is very simple which is great for indecisive people, but the flavor of the food is delicious! I ordered the tofu with veggies and white rice. The tofu is organic. They have 4 different types of sauce you can add to your bowl. Each sauce has a different degree of spicyness. The restaurant was really clean and the owner and staff were incredibly friendly. This restaurant is definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Great bowls!!!! Filling and healthy! Quick stop for lunch every and anytime!! Love the steakkkkk"}
{"text":"Super clean food.  Simple rice bowls with brown or white rice, steamed veggies and either beef, chicken or tofu.  I would have given 5 stars, but in the 5 times I have been there, they messed up my order all but once.  I watch them carefully now to be sure that I get what I order."}
{"text":"The only thing I'll miss the most about moving from my area is I'll be leaving my flame broiler  always mighty delicious no matter what time of day I go in for a bowl!"}
{"text":"We found ALOT of small, short hairs in our food. It seemed as though the cook just got a trim and shook his/her head over the noodles."}
{"text":"Great \"I couldn't make lunch and gotta go healthy\" place. Definitely will be back and happy it's close by my office."}
{"text":"Their food is food is amazing!!! I've tried the chicken bowl with brown rice and veggies. I love the fact they weigh the food for those of us who count calories and what not. Also, you must try the sauces...A-Mazing!!!"}
{"text":"The portions weren't bad, however both my mom (who I also ordered for) and I said that the vegetables we got were more on the raw side. Also the meat was really dry and hard to chew. I was the last order of the day so that may play a factor in it... but it was still edible. Just wasn't as enjoyable as I had hoped."}
{"text":"I had been to Flame Broiler a couple of times in California, so I was surprised to see one driving down Broadway on my way to the I-10. The concept is simple - choose between a mini bowl, regular bowl or a plate, then choose a base of rice (brown or white), steamed veggies, half veggies and half rice, or salad, then select your protein of chicken, beef, half and half or tofu. They also have a section of of hot sauces and \"magic sauce\" (essentially a soy sauce/teriyaki mix) for you to choose from and add to your liking. The magic sauce was a bit saltier than I remember it, but it was still good nonetheless. The prices are reasonable for the portion sizes and it's a good place to stop in for a quick bite."}
{"text":"I was so excited to stumble upon Flame Broiler earlier today! I'm from Cali, and this has always been my go to spot for a quick healthy meal. I usually go for the regular bowl with white meat chicken, brown rice and veggies. The magic sauce sets them apart from others. 
-It's located in a fairly new center on Bell.
-The inside is spacious and very clean. 
-The employees were friendly and gave   recommendation on sauces to try out.
-The meals are reasonably priced.
My husband and I will continue to support. I only hope that everyone will give this place a try."}
{"text":"Nice, healthy lunch, got the mini-bowl with chicken 1/2 veggies and 1/2 brown rice.  Perfect feel good bite, no frills no thrills, quick inexpensive and does the job for a work day lunch.  Customer service was friendly and very eager to help with ingredient suggestions."}
{"text":"I mean, if you want rice, chicken, and some veggies, this will work for you. It's simply just not anything to write home about."}
{"text":"Just tried this place with my husband and cousin for the first time and we all left satisfied and happy to discover a new favorite place to eat out at. They have a few sauce options that you can pour from yourself, which I love. I got the brown rice bowl with half and half and mixed the triple hot sauce and the magic sauce together. So good! The guy working there must be the owner or manager or something. He made sure we were taken care of. Food was on point. Customer service was on point. We'll be back. Thanks."}
{"text":"This has to be one of the fastest services I have had, and the food was amazing. The guy that served us was super friendly and helped us choose what the best combos were. I got the steak bowl and the flavor was great but was also able to add as much sauce as I wanted, and the Magic Sauce was extremely good. At this price and speed we will be back many more time."}
{"text":"Was so excited to see one here ! I had visited a flame broiler in flagstaff and loved it ! This location was awesome ! Everyone was so friendly , food was fresh . Amazing flavor ! Love the special sauce and spicy combined :) definitely a good place to go when your wanting a healthy fix but don't want to cook !"}
{"text":"Mold on the ice dispenser is gross. Food was good. The gentlemen behind the counter were friendly and helpful. The pop machine needed work."}
{"text":"Got a coupon in the mail and decided to give this place a try.. Healthy eating is a good idea for all of us... I walked in and no once else was in there eating and it was dinner time, that should have been a clue.. No one was at the counter, we spent a couple minutes just waiting for someone to take our order.. There were plenty of people working but they were busy on their phones or doing who knows what... 
We both ordered a bowl which was what the coupon offered, my wife ordered the chicken, it was overcooked, I ordered the beef it was not very tender and again overcooked... The veggies were almost raw... At any rate the meal was very bla and I was hungry when I left..There are several other restauraunts in this little strip center I would think any of them would be better... I will not back."}
{"text":"Meh. Husband and I ordered 50/50 bowls with brown rice. Not impressed. It looks like the bowls might have shrunk. I've never seen a scale on the line in all my years of eating at Flame Broiler. The chicken was diced so small and was way, way overcooked. It made it hard to chew the hard little chunks. The veggies were mostly cabbage. 

The workers were really nice and I liked the fact there were new sauces available. I'll give it another try. Hopefully my 2nd visit will be better."}
{"text":"Easily one of my new fave take-out spots.  My new go-to is the grilled chicken plate, brown rice and veggies.  I love the magic sauce, hot, and double hot sauce.  Their triple hot is definitely that !   I tried their steak last time and was tasty but the chicken is definitely where it's at!"}
{"text":"Best bowls around. If you can afford it, go for this over Panda every time. Also, look for coupons in your mailbox inserts if you live local, that's what brought us in."}
{"text":"If you want something quick and healthy this could be the place for you. I wish I could give it more stars but the food seems a bit bland and there's not enough vegetable choice to choice from. However, always great customer service and never a wait when I go in."}
{"text":"Two stars for the concept, but the food and presentation? Not so much. We eagerly went here one Saturday afternoon, close to lunch time, and was expecting something really flavorful and fresh. What we got were the bottom of the bin veggies (mostly carrots) with zero flavor on their own and chopped chicken that needed sauce to add any dimension. And the \"fruit salad?\"  Yeah, that was two orange wedges. 

Not for me."}
{"text":"This restaurant is unbelievable. I am from Orange County California and recently moved to Phoenix about 2 years ago. I Miss the beach, I miss the weather, I miss the skiing, but what I miss most of all is Flame Broiler. This place is hands-down Second To None the best fast food in the world. I was elated when I found out there was a flame broiler that just opened near me. These guys cook food like nobody's business. If you are an aficionado for steak chicken rice and Teriyaki bowls garnished with fresh steamed vegetables all cooked and barbecue to perfection at a ridiculously low price then this place is the spot. If you are the one that tends to like McDonald's cheeseburgers and Jack in the Box stuff jalapenos this one may not be for you but I can tell you that Flame Broiler is the best restaurant I've ever been to in my life better than any restaurant ever ever ever ever ever. Try it!!!!"}
{"text":"My first visit here. On a whim. Tasty bowls. Pick your meat or tofu. Whether rice or veggies or both. Green onions or avocados. Add sweet or hot sauce."}
{"text":"Healthier than most other fast food restaurants, decently priced and best of all the food is pretty good. I was very impressed that the chicken was actually not dry."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Simpe food that isn't overly terrible for you.   Affordable.  Good reward system. Love that you can get a 1/2 of an avocado too.  Parking is easy, the line moves fast.  This is my staple lunch place."}
{"text":"I'd never heard of the Flame Broiler, until it came to the Tempe area. According to the shop's website, the founder is Korean and when he was working right out of college, he couldn't find a healthy place to eat so he started this place and it has grown and spread ever since. 

So, firstly, the taste of the food is decent. It's not incredibly yummy, but it's also not terrible either. I had the mini bowl of chicken and vegetables and my friend got the beef and chicken with brown rice.

While the whole concept of Flame Broiler is that it serves healthy food, I would say that it's not really healthy since the meats are doused in salty sauce. There are several different kinds of sauces that you can put on your meal. The Magic Sauce is like a soy sauce/teriyaki sauce blend. The hot sauces are kind of strange tasting, mostly because they're too tangy/vinegary."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, fast and convenient. Two options for rice: white or brown. Three options for protein: Chicken, Beef, Tofu or mix together. Simple veges, fruit and with optional spending on avocado. Meat was a little dry, overall worth 4.5."}
{"text":"I used to eat this all the time in Cali! I am so beyond happy that they have finally opened one up in AZ. Best place ever!!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place yesterday and it was good. The food is fresh and tasty. The manager or owner was outside handing out samples of food. He was very friendly and welcoming. He even stopped at our table to ask how we liked the food and to give a little history about the company. Definitely made us feel welcomed."}
{"text":"Couldn't wait for this to open. This area needs more healthy Teriyaki Bowl options and Flame Broiler fills the bill. The grilled chicken has a nice char!  I was able to mix white rice, brown rice and veggies. Loved every bite. My only suggestion is to be a bit more generous with the rice. An affordable fix to satisfy a healthy appetite."}
{"text":"I love this place after having it in flagstaff and lake Havasu. When this location opened by my new house I went every week!! I'm vegetarian and finding good cheap healthy food Togo is HARD! I love the tofu! It's organic and non gmo. There were these two blonde girls that worked the locations opening. They seemed like the only two employees for a while. They ALWAYS made me the best super charred tofu! It was like seriously BLACK. I love it extra burnt.

The last time I went to this location the girls were not there, and it was an entire new staff. I asked for my usual,extra extra charred tofu. And I swear only ONE side of the 6 was lightly \"charred\". I was so annoyed when I got home I cooked it on my grill to crisp it which took away from the point of them correctly making my order. 

I just went today. And there was another set of new staff. Lol. And it was two young males. I explained my past experience and wanted to make sure they understood how I wanted my order. The young man who made my chicken bowl was so nice and said I would absolutely get everything I asked for .

I got home and I SWEAR not ONE piece had a CRISP. And almost every piece was basically raw tofu. So annoyed with this place and I seriously LOVE flame broiler. Any other location is an hour away. Please tell me this is extra extra charred. I even cooked it in my wok to crisp it with extra sauce. Sadly will still come to pester until they get it right, seriously NOT that hard..."}
{"text":"There is not a whole lot of 'fast' Asian up this way. Just found this place and love it!! Very healthy and loads of flavor. They do white & brown rice and veges AND will do all veges or half and half of anything. Lots of sauce options. The magic sauce is very flavorful. The hot sauce is not just hot, but lots of flavor. Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Always loved this place when I was out in CA. Now that there's one by my work here in AZ I'm going to eat there often."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Flame Broiler and we'll be back! We got the half and half with white meat- loved the cabbage salad and dressing. My boyfriend added avocado and he loved it. It was all fresh and flavorful! The veggies were good- I always like carrots and the cabbage was a good mix with the meat and rice. Staff was very friendly and took the time to explain the menu to us newbies!"}
