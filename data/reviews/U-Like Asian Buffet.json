{"text":"Man U-Like ain't know nothing about how to do business around here. You are a restaurant, so focus on your goddamn food! I don't care if the \"atmosphere\" is good or the price is low, I want my food hot and delicious at all times.   I've been to U-Like twice. During the first visit, they did not have many customers. I told myself not to care about that and just go ahead and taste their food. It was around 8:20 at night which to me was not late at all. But hell, almost everything was gone. I was like yo this ain't cool man. I'm paying the same money and all I get is cold-ass dumplings and broken fish bone?!  The second visit was even worse. They got the price raised. I had dinner and a drink and it was almost 20 bucks (not including tips). That is too much for a crappy buffet like U-Like and I didn't like that at all. Sushi rolls were constantly gone and so were the fruits and seafoods. I mean c'mon man.  On top of everything, what's up with the name?! U-Like? You bet my ass U-Like.  Man I'm not a hater I swear. I love Chinese food and all and I've been to a lot in Madison. But U-Like needs to get a new owner if it wants to stay in the business, honestly."}
{"text":"I hesitated to come when I saw the reviews before, but after I tried most of the food here I think this place deserve a better review.  Sushi is quite good. The soy sauce provided here is not that suitable for sushi, and the rice is a little bit hard and needs some more vinegar, but salmon and tuna and others are fresh and taste good enough. Miso soup very tasty. Lo Mein veeeery tasty. I also recommend the soup with pork in it, it's not often seen in any other buffet and I see it's avoiding being Americanized. General Tso's chicken tastes better that QQ express and journey (come on this is totally not Chinese but I do like its taste, well, sometimes.) Shao Mai (is it written like this? Chinese friends told me this, and I believe it's written like pork Dim Sum here) is absolutely the best I've had in Madison.  Will come again."}
{"text":"Quite ostentatious. I don't care that the food is arranged in nice floral ensembles, nor the assortment of sashimi, rolls, and seafood salads offered, nor the plethora of seafood items on the hot bar, nor the enticing ceiling light fixtures which reminds me of my college rental house basement room designated for certain substances; the flavor of the food should be top priority at any culinary establishment. U-Like has all of the above except the flavor. After a round of selected sashimi pieces and a few bites off the hot plate offerings, I was at loss of what else to get even though I was still hungry.   For Chinese food and sushi on the west side, VIP is right across the street; for buffet at a more reasonable price and with more diverse flavors, World Buffet is less than a mile away."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try since I was staying near by and heard it was new. Overall very good buffet.  I went on a Monday, so as with any buffet timing can be everything. I started with a bowl of hot and sour soup, my gauge on how the rest of the food will be. The hot and sour was very tasty. Just the right heat, nice bit of tart, it was good. Probably the best hot and sour soup I've had at a buffet.  Sushi was a decent offering. I have to agree with another review, in that the rice for the nigiri sushi was nothing to write home about. With that said, hats off to them even attempting to serve nigiri. Most buffets stick to rolls.  The hibachi was good as well. The chef didn't speak much English so that was a small challenge but nothing that couldn't be worked through. It added to the experience.  The rest of the offerings on the buffet were good. With the exception of some teriyaki chicken stick that we're dry as a bone. Nice salad bar, decent selection of deserts even though I didn't have room for any.  My only real complaint would be the crab legs were on the cold bar instead of being hot. I would have munched on a few of those had they been hot.  All in all for $17 and some change I had a really nice buffet meal along with a Sapporo beer to wash it all done. I hope they can maintain the quality over time."}
{"text":"Terrible with a capital T.  We came to Madison for a wedding over the 4th of July weekend and decided to stop here.  The food doesn't look bad upon visual inspection but it was cold.  Several rows of buffets and only one of them had a few dishes that were actually steaming.  The sushi did not taste fresh but instead had a tough feel like it had been sitting out for awhile.  We love chinese buffets and have been in what looks to be a small dive but has outstanding food.  This place looks pretty but after $60 for our family of 4 (one being childrens pricing) it was a horrific waste of money.  They have a big establishment and a lot of choices and a great set up so I hope they get it figured out and improve the food."}
{"text":"I was so happy when I had learned a buffet opened inside of a place that I considered a good place for buffet Chinese food. RIP China One.  U-Like a good buffet. I found out that it's a chain buffet, albeit with a bad name, U-Like? Hmm... as a 35 year old man, I'm just not digging the name.  While it does look cool inside... the cost for a dinner buffet was quite unbalanced to what other places offer. On the east side, The Journey offers more sushi, hibachi, and a larger selection of \"Chinese\" offerings, for $3 less per person. It's $15 per person for dinner, for less variety of the same quality of things that I can get elsewhere. -1 star  So, on to the food: I had the dumplings from the buffet - they were not freshly made, but weren't the cheap frozen ones, and they were cooked properly. +1 star  The sushi was laid out nicely, and had nigiri & sashimi offerings. However, the rice (which I consider to be the most important) was bland, and tasteless. -1 star  The hibachi was behind glass, with an area of about 6\" to push a plate through. However, the chef could not reach it, so I had to push my arm through, grab the plate, pick it up and give it to the chef. I'm a tall guy, and my arms aren't 6\" tall at my shoulder. -1 star  Also - at the hibachi, I had to pick beef... the pork and the chicken were frozen solid to the pan. -1 star  They have been open 2 weeks, and I don't know if it's because it's a chain place, or if it's because they're just new... but I'll go back in a few months once they've settled in."}
{"text":"Uhm, no... don't bother. This place is overpriced crap. Save your money. Might as well have fast food, at least it has flavor."}
{"text":"I don't think U-Like Buffet is as bad as some previous reviews suggested. But I don't see myself as a returning customer in the near future.   Caveat: I have never been to the West side World Buffet, so I cannot make the comparison. My standard for a good Chinese/Pan Asian buffet is the Journey Buffet on the East side.   During our visit, U-Like's biggest problem was the slow turnaround for food--half of the Sushi plates were constantly empty, Shumai came after 20 mins, and Crab legs only appeared twice. I understand it could be a cost-saving strategy for the restaurant, but it is a no-no for a buffet restaurant. I believe a lot of people would agree with me on this standard. I hope they can correct this problem when they gather more customers in the future, otherwise it could lead to a vicious cycle...  + Sushi rolls are pretty good + hibachi is a plus, and I like that it is more tailored than Journey Buffet + delicious fried dough + very large space to accommodate big groups   - no nigiri and sashimi  - no steak  - no fried chicken  - no oyster"}
{"text":"Speaking strictly to my fellow vegetarians/vegans - Don't bother right now. Everything is very nice - atmosphere, service, layout but all you see is meat, meat and more meat. My eyes lit up when I saw Tofu but it was Ma Po tofu(beef in it when prepared traditionally). The soups looked good but all had chicken or beef broth. The only items I was able to have was Lo Mein, Singapore Rice and some of the Mushrooms/Green beans. What I had WAS good and showed promise but an utter lack of options kinda stunk. I have the same complaint about World Buffet to an extent(although they usually have egg foo young and sometimes a bean curd/vegetable).  To be clear - I did \"not expect\" a vegetarian restaurant. Chinese food is very diverse and even other buffets that I did not like the quality of, offered more options with such a large buffet. I am not expecting \"Green Owl\" or something but I am not expecting a Steakhouse either."}
{"text":"Went with 2 friends for lunch today.  We 3 were excited to try the new buffet.  DELICIOUS!  CLEAN!  FRIENDLY!  So happy there is a place to go for a buffet carry-out that has Ribs!  And good Ribs at that!  Going to back to try the Hibachi grill because I just got to full on everything else!  =)"}
{"text":"Just an update after having been to this place and World Buffet a couple of times since they've opened (more than I care to admit!)-- really, I don't think there's that much difference between the two.    The sushi offering are actually extremely inconsistent at both places, both in terms of offerings and quality.  They're both probably 2.5 star places that I'm willing to round up to three because of (1) price, (2) the fact that I can take both kids here and they can find stuff they like (pizza, chicken nuggets, unlimited dessert), (3) if I exercise restraint, I can get something reasonably healthy (they both tend to have loads of fruit in the dessert areas), and (4) my expectations of a place like this are pretty low going in-- it is what it is!  All of that said, I'll be back!"}
