{"text":"Incredible chicken parm, salads, and the turkey for the sub was just out of the oven. Outstanding quality and service."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went here for a mid-afternoon meal for the first time and we were surprised and delighted by the sincere service and stellar food. Joanne, who is an absolute gem, welcomed us like family. We enjoyed the pan fried chicken, rolltini, zucchini pancakes, and pasta salad. This is now our favorite little place in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Amazing. I love this place.  Incredible ham and bean soup, eggplant LIGHTLY breaded with tomato sauce and provolone, zucchini fritters, Italian BLT.  In a pinch or an emergency, they deliver. I've experienced both."}
{"text":"Murray Hill market was recommended to me by a close friend and I have to say I was served the best sandwich I had ever eaten in my life!The super friendly staff almost makes me feel like they miss me when I haven't been there for a while. Real nice little quiet private place to eat upstairs. It really is the staff that keeps me coming back very friendly people"}
{"text":"My first time trying Murray Hill Market and I got the eggplant parm sandwich on a hoagie. The sandwich itself was very good. Homemade marinara soaked into the crunchy bread and made each bite delish. For getting just a sandwich (no sides) it was a little overpriced. The sandwich was $8.95, but somewhere else would probably run $6-7. I would rank this a 5-star if it weren't for the prices, or if $8.95 got you a sandwich plus a side. I probably won't go back unless I'm really craving eggplant parm."}
{"text":"Oh, how I love this little market. It's like they read my mind and picked out all my favorite things! Best thing? JENI'S!!! Yes, I walk in in the dead of winter and they have my all time favorite, Grapefruit Frozen Yogurt. I couldn't even get it at their retail store in Chagrin, but there it was! To die for -- if you're a fan of the sweet/bitter taste of grapefruit you'll be amazed.   They carry Lotte Sac Sac -- a great asian fruit drink with pieces of mandarin orange in it.  Their  soups and salads are always incredibly good, and the sandwich they made me was delicious. Warm, friendly people, a jewel to be found no where else."}
{"text":"Love MHM. Michelle and Billy are so knowledgeable and friendly. The food selection  and variety is amazing. Everything is fresh out of the oven! A must for any Clevelander east or west !"}
{"text":"I really like this little market. The decor is welcoming and the variety of products is pretty pleasing as well. Considering it's a market, I don't expect much more stock. Also, JENI'S, as Habby mentioned, is stocked here, which was THRILLING because I had been wanting to try the Queen City Cayenne for at least a year. There was no question about it, I had to try it when I found it here and am slowly working my way through the flavors.   I've only had their hot food once, which was on St. Patrick's Day--the reuben was delicious, though a bit pricey, but for something other than pasta or pizza here, I was willing to pay the money.   We met the owner when we came in the first week they opened and he was a fantastic man. Very friendly and easy to talk to--that really makes me want to support his business."}
{"text":"A great mom and pop grocery.  Fresh produce, deli, soups, sandwiches, and other pantry items at reasonable prices.  Not a huge selection but I didn't feel like I couldn't find what I needed to make a quick dinner tonight.  Delicious food made in-house.  I walked out with bananas, homemade meatballs, and a loaf of yummy crusty bread for under $10.  Not a bad deal.  I will definitely be coming back here!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome eggplant parm - served correctly with provolone, not mozzarella. The bread was excellent, too - an unexpected surprise. The owner/operators are wonderful, and there are a few places to sit upstairs. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I can only say listen to John D Get the sandwiches. Delicious and made to order. Authentic little shop. Dine in the store or on the street. Not literally on the street they have covered tables but you get the drift."}
{"text":"Great place to eat lunch at with friendly and prompt staff. I got a portobello mushroom with spinach and Gorgonzola, for about four dollars. It was very satisfying. On the premises, you can eat at tables inside or out. I wasn't a fan of the coffee though."}
{"text":"This is a neat little grocery store. I love the convience of it and the uniqueness of some of the products it offers- Vosges Haut Chocolate and Jeni's Ice Cream?!?!  Like Kaitlin D suggests, it will lead to Queen City Cayenne heaven- spicy sweet fire on my ice cream palate waiting to be quenched with each spoonful of Queen City Cayenne.  ( I could write a poem its that good haha)  Additionally, they have lovely meals made to go- made to order on the spot.  I will admit it took a little while (15-20 mins) to get all the meals ready to go.  I was done shopping before they were even ready.    The groceries are slightly pricey and the selection is slightly slim (its the size a medium convience store).  They have good prime rib salad (it was a little rare for my liking though) and delicious zucchini pancakes!!  Everyone tells me to go and try their sandwiches, which are suppose to be the best"}
{"text":"the good: the food when it's fresh prepared! amazing. try the zucchini pancakes. and the people who work here are kick ass  the bad: when you buy fresh food as groceries from here. half the time it's rotten or almost rotten"}
{"text":"Murray Hill Market gets 5 stars for their amazing personable service and neighborhood feel. My team met there for a lunch meeting. The owner is so super friendly and enthusiastic about their food, and their food is GOOD. She gave me a few samples of their freshly grilled fish so I could see what I might like for a sandwich. I loved their salmon as well as their crusted tilapia. I ended up with the crusted tilapia sandwich, but will go for the salmon next time! They also feature local goods, like Little Italy pasta sauce as well as Polish desserts (called snoogle.)   This place is perfect for outdoor patio hangouts and meetings. There is a small space on the upstairs level with a table, but it's not for large parties. I'm definitely coming back while the weather is still nice.   I appreciate this market overall for their focus on local & fresh goods and their friendly service!"}
{"text":"Our group of 5 had a nice variety of salads and sandwiches. The food was pretty good. The service was slow and the girl behind the counter was incredibly rude to all of us. She was so rude that we won't return."}
{"text":"Had a quick lunch with a sub deluxe sandwich and  eggplant parmigiana. Fresh, very tasty food. Great friendly service. Definitely coming back when next time in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"This is such a hidden gem in Little Italy! It's not only a convenience store stocked up with anything you'll need from aspirin to laundry detergent, but it also has some fresh fruits/veggies! My favorite parts of this market are the unbeatable friendly service and the absolutely delicious sandwiches. I love both the Prochetta and the Prime Rib sandwiches. They're $8.50 each and come with soooo much MEAT!! Definitely worth the price :) They also have quite a selection of Italian sodas! I love pairing my sandwiches with the Sanpellegrino blood orange soda. YUM!  They have a loyalty club now, where if you spend $50, you'll get $5 off! Although they don't have cards yet, they will make a note on your receipt, so make sure you bring this up if you want to save some money :)"}
{"text":"Came across this cute market in Murray Hill walking with my girlfriend. This place is awesome! We got the roast beef sandwich which was amazing. The eggplant parm and some zucchini fried thing which was amazing. Great selection of ice cream and gelato in the freezer. Food is all homemade it seems. Will be back often!"}
{"text":"This is a cute little market that is fun to check out if you are out for a walk in the Little Italy area. They stock a good variety of items that you would find in a local convenience store - cleaning items, ice cream, alcohol, and food items. What makes this place unique from convenience stores though is what you can find behind the deli counter - Italian meats and other gourmet treats such as artichoke hearts. They even sell fresh loaves of bread (not sure whether they make it in house though)."}
{"text":"One word... Jeni's...   ...ice cream that is.  There's a whole cooler devoted to the stuff. Around twenty flavors. The most flavors offered in a retail store in NE Ohio and quite possibly all of Ohio. No more mail order, folks. Get your Jeni's fix HERE. I will be going broke from this place.  So I stopped in for some lunch. Got the Fish Tacos. Was the iffiest thing on the menu. FISH TACOS IN LITTLE ITALY?!  I figured why not. Well, I was pleasantly surprised. They were GREAT. Complete with red cabbage, chipotle cream and sides of homemade salsa, guac and chips. I opted for the mahi-mahi. They also offer salmon.  The place itself is really cool, very old school. The guy behind the counter even donned an apron and a bow tie. I felt like I was back in time. Nice touch.   They offer just about everything you could want including imports and specialty items. There's not a huge selection of any particular thing, but they have good options. Everything from cheese to deli meats to prepared foods and cleaning supplies. They have a nice selection of fruits and veggies too. It will be interesting to see how things turn over.   Considering they opened in the dead of winter, it looks like they are off to a good start. I look forward to walking up for lunch when it gets warmer. They have enough room for some potential outside seating.   You can keep up with their daily specials and new items on Facebook.  I wish them the best of luck!"}
{"text":"I like this kind of place, cute little local supermarket, with just about everything you would need for a last minute bite or ingredient. They've got all the elements I love in this kind of place: chalkboard with daily specials, produce right at the entrance, everything is red brick and wood, staff wearing aprons, a deli with all kinds of yummies. My favorite is the spicy sausage stuffing wrapped in banana peppers (I wish they took out the seeds though, cause it can be a little too heated at times). The daily food keeps me coming back as I want to see what they will dish out next. It is and certainly tastes like home cooking (made with love, as they say). And the staff is very friendly   The only negatives is that price may be a little jacked up (that's expected from a small local market), but they should work on a faster cashing out system. I've been there 3 times this past week, and each time, it has taken several minutes to get the cashier machine to work for my credit card  Aside from that, I will certainly continue to make weekly stop-ins to just experience the atmosphere, see what's cooking and maybe grab a few produce for my place."}
{"text":"I got the salmon banh mi sandwich. Excellent sandwich all around. Nice spot to grab lunch."}
{"text":"The owners here are great, super friendly. Prices are a little high but that's the price you pay for convenience. We still shop here!"}
{"text":"Hey, how you doin? While in little Italy I decided to come here based on the review of the chicken parm sandwich reviewed by another member. I wouldn't say I was severely disappointed but I was disappointed.   The store: This is a little neighborhood market that sits at the top of Murray Hill. When you walk in you'll notice a prepared foods area to the right, market goods for sale on the left and in the back what looks like the vino section. It's pretty cramped in there if you're a bigger guy like myself. However, I did like the feel of the store...homey.   The sandwich: Small, if I had to guess smaller than 6 inches or close to it. The chicken was tasty but thin, good sauce and not overwhelming but a lot of times I felt like I was getting just bread and sauce in most of my bite. I liked the melted cheese on top of the bread, nice touch. I guess maybe my expectations were a little high and coming from an Italian family I definitely thought the portion would be larger.   If I go back I'll try the Porcetta which is what I originally went for."}
{"text":"Murray Hill Market breached the catering agreement.     After extensive plans with the company were made, we left messages for our contact to follow up with us and received no replies.  We scrambled to find a catering alternative, but because of the late timing, had to change the scale of the event.   Too late, we received a call from management; \"oops\" and \"sorry\" and something about \"lost your number\" (and email?  And name?  And agreement?)  Murray Hill Market is not a professional or trustworthy business. Don't risk your event with this company."}
{"text":"Porchetta, arancini, eggplant parm. All amazing.   Everything about this place is fantastic, minus the fact that I don't live an hour closer.  But, having a staff that speaks Italian plus all of this wonderful food makes me feel like I'm at home. (But, without having to spend hours in the kitchen.)   Just go there already. Leave some for me."}
{"text":"This is one of the best parts of living in Little Italy. I love having a neighborhood grocery store right down the street. Their sandwiches are spectacular and their beer/wine selection is pretty solid. While groceries (milk, eggs, etc.) are somewhat pricey, it is worth it (to me) to not have to leave the neighborhood for 1 or 2 small items. They also don't put prices on anything except their prepared foods, so it's always a bit of a \"surprise!\" when you go to check out."}
{"text":"Grabbed a meatball sub and a Maine Root. Sub was excellent. The meatballs were perfectly seasoned and cooked.   Haven't ordered a salad, but saw one and those things are huge!  Service was good, if not a tad slow. But it was lunch time after all, so kind of expected."}
{"text":"Stopped in on my way home from a weekend in Cleveland  because I wanted to see what an Italian deli was like. Sampled several things all of which were amazing. I tried Capicola, zucchini pancakes, and the Roma potato salad. All of these things were absolutely amazing. Despite having a 5 hour drive home I went ahead and bought potato salad and restocked the cooler with ice just for that. The staff here was absolutely great also, probably the friendliest most genuine people I had met in my 4 days in Cleveland. Would love to go back some day!"}
{"text":"I had the Asian Philly Roast Beef sandwich here yesterday and this sandwich pretty near blew my mind. The roast beef was super tender, the bok choy was proportioned perfectly and seemed super fresh, but nothing compared to whatever sauce they put on that sandwich. It was my first time hearing about the shop, let alone going to it, so I was floored by what my tastebuds were telling me about my food. Now my only debate is whether or not I want to try something new when I go again (very soon). Their menu is likely full of other simply delightful items, but if I don't like my next order as much as yesterday's, I'll be thoroughly upset with myself for wasting precious stomach real estate on something that wasn't that sandwich. My internal judges needed no time for deliberation on that sandwich. It was immediate 10s across the board."}
{"text":"On the pricier side, but they've gotta pay rent, and the area is pricey. That said, everything I've ever had is delicious. From their eggplant parm hero to the zucchini pancakes. I also love that they have single serving Jeni's containers."}
{"text":"The Italian deluxe was excellent, but the turkey with the cranberry mayo was other worldly. Unique and delicious potato salad. And they deliver!"}
{"text":"What an absolute delight this little market is. I'm sad this is my first time here.   We decided to head to little Italy tonight because the weather was so perfect. Well, the entire evening was a disaster. Dinner was ruined by horrible service at the restaurant we wanted to dine at. Then we got a ticket. It was just a nightmare until we walked in here. The guy behind the counter was so polite. His personality was so warm and he was just thoughtful. He could see the pissed off look on my face so, he asked and I told him about our evening.  He made us 2 delicious sandwiches. The Asian and the BLT. He also introduced me to the snoogles. He gifted us one because of the night we had.  He really was an awesome guy. We ate and enjoyed the little market, we were also able to pick up a few things.  I love small markets like this. I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Love the sandwiches. I've tried most of them, but generally regret when I don't go with the Italian BLT. Porcetta is good, but if you don't eat it straight away, it will get soggy. When picking between the two Italian sandwiches go for the upcharge on the supreme it, makes a difference. They've got a good turkey sandwich on g-free bread too  (although I don't know if you can substitute that on others).   Lastly their zucchini pancakes are the bomb, get them wrapped in foil and take them home for a savory, cheesey treat."}
{"text":"It's a cute little store with great sandwiches. There is an upstairs room with a homie feel where you can go to and eat your food. The sandwich that I tried was good and because they are a grocery store, they had a large selection of drinks to go with it. Also, if you are looking for a quick snacks they have nuts and dried fruits and chocolates at the front."}
{"text":"Me and my wife like their zucchini pancakes. Also got meatloaf this trip. It was tasty, moist."}
{"text":"The staff is so friendly and welcoming! The food is so delicious and fresh!! I live three doors down from this adorable gem and I am here all the time!  True, it's not where you would go for all your groceries, but for an odd or end it's perfect and so convenient! Don't feel like cooking anything tonight? That's okay! The market's food is better than anything I could ever make!"}
{"text":"So...where to start   First met Michele and John at the Feast a couple of years ago and talked about hosting a dinner for us, we finally made it in last night with a dinner for 6 and wow incredible.  An experience to remember.  The food florentine stuffed cavalo, arancini, mussels, cheese ravioli with sage butter, shaved Brussels sprouts gratinee, Milanese short ribs and Scottish shortbread was spectacular. The service impeccable and the time spent with everyone made for a great evening.  We are coming back"}
{"text":"Found this place while looking for a good lunch spot near Case Western's campus while I was at a conference. It's in Little Italy, a couple blocks away from the main drag. It was one of the best discoveries my friends and I made while we were in Cleveland! It's a grocery/deli with a great food selection. It's small, but has a lot of character and is air conditioned. The food was to die for. I tried their porchetta sandwich, eggplant Parmesan sandwich, watermelon/feta/arugula salad (which they sadly don't have daily), a black bean quinoa salad, and their salmon. It's really good quality food and their sandwich bread is amazing! The best part of this place might be the staff though - they are truly friendly, kind, and make this a great spot to frequent! Prices are reasonable for size and quantity. I also had a potato chip cookie, which I highly recommend you grab on your way out. Limited seating, so not great for a group larger than 5. If you're looking for lunch in this area, definitely pay this place a visit!"}
{"text":"Murray Hill Market is primarily a corner store for me. They always have whatever quick things I need stocked, and stock my favorite sodas and snacks. Also one of few places locally that stock Jarritos (and yes, the good flavors).  After hearing about great reviews of their food, I decided to give their deli menu a shot. I went in with my girlfriend, and split two sandwiches. She got the chicken parmesan, and I got the roast beef prime rib sandwich. The chicken parmesan was solid across the board: chicken was cooked right, the crust was well-set, and the bread paired well with the sauce. The beef prime rib was packed with flavor a bit on the greasy side, but the bread soaked it up just enough. The portioning of both was slightly skimpy, but that might just be me being spoiled by portions elsewhere.  The deli options are a bit on the pricey side, but they keep quality in mind when they whip up your food. All in all, Murray Hill Market is somewhat of a landmark when passing through Little Italy, and deserves a visit, or six."}
{"text":"I'm afraid if I write a review, people will flock here and I'll be out of a sandwich supplier! I love how quaint and personal this grocery store/restaurant/deli is. The sandwiches are a must try. The Rotisserie Turkey Breast sandwich and Meatball Sub are my favorites, but I aim to try them all (multiple times). They prepare them right in front of you...fresh. So sometimes, they can take a few minutes but the wait is easily forgotten when you take that first bite. They also have a mean dried fruit mix and a good selection of interesting sodas. They have bar style seating upstairs and one large table. During warmer months, they have outdoor patio seating.   The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because I most recently tried the Porchetta, and found it to be slightly salty for my taste and a little heavy on the kale. But that was only one visit out of many. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is a cute place tucked away in Little Italy. Among the sandwiches they offer I love the portobello and veggie sandwich. It is loaded to the brim with sautéed veggies and a vegan pesto mayo. Very simple but very yummy, very filling."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've tried most things on the menu but the porchetta sandwich is by far my fave. Savory pork in a wonderful fresh baguette topped with sautéed kale and Parmesan. I love sitting up top of the grocery and watching the little Italian deli experience happen below. I love this place!!"}
{"text":"Excellent, healthy food options and great customer service! So nice to see time and care put into food options, as well as a good selection of salads, sandwiches, and cured meats. Well done."}
{"text":"I wish there was a corner store like this in my neighborhood. They have a small but solid beer selection, arguably best sandwiches in Cleveland, Jeni's Ice Cream and wonderful service. My favorite sandwich thus far was the Porchetta. I recommend the deluxe Italian and Asian Philly too. I did not mind waiting for them to prepare my lunch. The legendary J-Dilla was playing on the stereo followed up by Ohio's own RJD2. Excellent instrumental music to listen to. The 3 meatballs for $5 is a great deal."}
{"text":"This place is so wonderful I don't want anyone else to find out about it but I'm posting this anyway because I just have to! The employees and owner are super friendly and helpful. Food is fresh, delicious, and authentic. And what's even better is they deliver--which is speedy and also free. :) I'm a frequent consumer of their yummy fried eggplant slices!"}
{"text":"When first looking at the menu, I thought I would hate this place. I'm not big into Italian or sandwiches but after finding a Groupon I thought \"why not?\".  Now I can't stop going back.  The roasted turkey breast sandwich was great. The perfect meat to bread ratio and was super fresh- even though I strolled in at 8:00pm.  I also have opted to do my grocery shopping here which is a big added bonus. They have the essentials, which is all I really need. It's great that they have fresh produce and they freeze their past soups to buy in big containers. That's the best. I bought the Vegetable Tortilla, stored it in my fridge for a month and when I heated it up, it tasted like it had just been made.   Next stop here: Some of that yummy looking wine."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Our deli sandwiches were 9 on a scale of 10. The store was busy so had to wait a bit, and was totally worth it. We ordered for takeout Asian Philly--roast beef, bok choy, sriracha and teriyaki sauces, and cheese; and BLT--fried pancetta, Brie, roasted garlic, arugula, and tomato;  both on warm buttery crunchy boat-shaped buns. The store had lots of extras one might need, plus warm foods, cold salads, beer, wine and Jeni's.  A must go-to when passing through Little Italy."}
{"text":"By chance I meandered into this old fashioned market while visiting Cleveland from NYC. Designed to tempted ones aesthetics and appetite, I was intrigued by the variety, depth and breadth of its wares. More impressive were the folk that owned and worked in this establishment. Michelle, one of the owners, greats all who enter with a warmth and agreeableness that one wishes for. In her inquiry and my openness she discovered I had a bit of an upset stomach. So she offered to make me a serving of avocado and toast which is by the way not on the menu. It was delicious and settled my stomach and all I can say is I wish I could take this market home with me."}
