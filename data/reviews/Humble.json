{"text":"We used Humble Pies to cater the dessert portion of a Southern Celebration in Madison and LOVED all the wonderful single serving creations, including pecan pies, chess pies, peach pies, and hummingbird cupcakes. Had many rave reviews on all the sweets. They were great to work with, including adapting a recipe for the cupcakes for me. I highly recommend them for any catering needs, or just to stop in for a taste one of their fabulous delights!"}
{"text":"Pro tip, the sweet pies are amazing,  but the savory pasties/quiche/etc are out of this WORLD.  Personal favorites are the Monte Crusto pasty, the Chicken Pot Pasty, and basically any of their quiches. The menu rotates pretty frequently,  and is both seasonal and super locally sourced.  Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"We stumbled in with four college students and another teenager (and a pair of foodie parents) this afternoon for a little something for the sweettooth... What a great surprise! We'll be back... Yum!  Loved the customer service, too."}
{"text":"We had two savory and two sweet pies. They were all delicious. Our favorite was the goat cheese, grapes, and rosemary; not ingredients we would think to combine in a pie but it was scrumptious! The quiche would have been better warmed up but we were having a picnic. Lemon ricotta and fudge (sort of fudgy brownie or flourless chocolate cake) were also delicious and not too sweet, just right. Would definitely like to go back."}
{"text":"I love stopping in here and having a coffee and pie.  Savory, sweet or gillette there is something in the case for you.  My biggest suggestion, request, constructive criticism is to get a toaster oven.  I love my pie warm but not in a microwave.  All the love, nurturing and beauty that is created in that sweet little morsel is crushed to bits by the big bad microwave.  

The owners are awesome and they showcase all sorts of local stuff.  This year for Thanksgiving I have talked my wife into letting us order one pie (she likes to make pie at the house). 

Go, sit, people watch and have pie and coffee (or wisco pop!) Now that is a great afternoon."}
{"text":"Very pricy for not much food. That being said, the pies are great. Wish the hours were a little better, I would go more if so."}
{"text":"The store name \"Humble Sweet and Savory Pies\" caught my eye.  I had been trying to stop there for months, but the hours didn't fit into my work schedule.  They open later in the morning in the summer.  Sometimes, they open their doors before the set opening time.  

Last week, I finally got there at a time when they were open.  I was totally overwhelmed by the selection!  So many different flavors and different kinds--hand pies, mini pies, toaster pastry pies, etc, etc!  I was intrigued by the \"savory\" pie, but I didn't try one since the sweet pies looked so good!  I got a strawberry-rhubarb hand pie.  It was a bit pricey at $5, but it was worth it!  I split it with my husband.  It was SO good, very rich and buttery.  You could really tell that the ingredients were fresh, and it was perfectly baked.  

I'm looking forward to going there again, but as I mentioned before, the hours have seemed inconsistent.  I stopped by this morning at around 11:30, and there was a sign that they were closed for the day.  If not for the inconsistent hours, I would definitely give the place 5 stars."}
{"text":"Bottom line: Humble. Sweet and Savory Pies are truly exceptional. Superior quality made possible by utilizing fresh, local ingredients and expert craftsmanship. If you are ever in the Madison area, be sure to check them out. I promise you will not be disappointed. (Read below for the complete review, fan-girling, and pie related puns). 

I discovered Humble when I was in the Madison area this past week and went to Jordan's for a speciality beer week related event pairing local beer with Humble's pies. To say I was utterly blown away by Humble's pies is an understatement. I knew I had to visit their shop. 

I'm an avid traveler and self-proclaimed foodie, and I can say with absolute certainty that Humble's pies are the best pies I have ever eaten. Their flavors are unique but incredibly well balanced, each highlighting every single ingredient and making them their own stars. (Cue music from Boston: It's more than a \"filling\"! I see my \"meringue\" walking away!) My favorite pie I tried was the rhubarb custard. The tart rhubarb was delightfully nestled into creamy custard, completely elevated by the top note of orange juice and zest. Just typing this makes my mouth water. 

But the best part of these pies are definitely the crust. The texture is perfect, buttery and flakey. Not too crumbly, but not too crisp or doughy, it's truly the \"Goldilocks of crusts\".

But my absolute favorite part about Humble is their commitment to supporting the community and local farmers by utilizing fresh, local ingredients in all of their products. Seeing local rhubarb at the farmers market and eating a rhubarb custard pie at Humble the same day is the key to the superior quality that makes up Humble's pies. Their shop displays a complete list of which farms all their local ingredients are sourced from and a poster of \"Southern Wisconsin: proud partner of buy fresh, buy local\" hangs proudly on the wall. 

The only negative I would give Humble, is that it's too far away from where I live and I can't go there everyday and eat their pies for breakfast, lunch and dinner. So do yourself a favor, stop reading this review and go get yourself some amazing, top notch quality pie. Please post it so I can live vicariously through you! 

Thanks Humble for an outstanding pie experience!"}
{"text":"I live right around the corner, and I am ashamed to say that I just went in for the second time.  My mom and I stopped in and got a rhubarb, raspberry and ginger crescent pie thing (I forgot what they're called!) and a caramel filled mini pie with chocolate on top.  They were amazing!  We heated them up a little bit and they were SO GOOD.  Definitely going to make this a new weekly trip.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"This little shop is awesome - their pies are delicious. They have really interesting flavors and the best pie crust I've had. My current favorite is bourbon blueberry."}
{"text":"I have not actually gone to Humble....our daughter was given four 'hand pies' to bring back
to Chicago. She shared them with us the next night. 
Can I say that these little pies exploded with delicious flavor? The crust was out of this world -
and that is saying a lot, because pie crusts are frequently just holding filling, and sometimes are left on the plate. These crusts were buttery and delicious. The fillings were fantastic, too. Apple, strawberry rhubarb....and 2 others, all had just the right balance of tart/sweet to compliment the amazing crust. I can only imagine that the pies would have been even better had we had them the day they were baked.These were refrigerated overnight and were still luscious the next day. Applause, Humble, for a job well done!"}
{"text":"Delicious sweet and savory pies with both classic and modern flavors. Tiny little shop and outdoor seating as well. They do take out and advanced orders too. Good coffee and friendly service. I really wish they were open on Sundays to purchase pies for family dinners or brunch."}
{"text":"Humble provided an assortment of beautiful and delicious mini pies for our wedding this summer and we could not have been happier with choosing them!  We were tired of boring wedding cakes and wanting something different.  Not only do they taste great, but mini pies are so stylish and look great on a dessert table. Jill and Shelly were wonderful to work with, extremely accommodating and responsive. I love how they rotate their flavors to incorporate seasonal fruits. We chose the buttered rum apple, mixed berry with thyme, key lime, chocolate chess, and alabama pecan.....impossible to choose a favorite because they were all outstanding.  If you are looking for a unique and rustic dessert option for your wedding, look no further than Humble!"}
{"text":"I just died & went to mini pie heaven.  Stopped in for the first time today, recommended by friends who live in the neighborhood. What took me so long?  I'm usually in a hurry when driving past & the lack of parking was a bit of a negative to me.  After getting two sweet pies (blueberry thyme goat cheese & sour cherry galette) to go, I can say the parking will no longer be an issue for me... I'd walk (okay, run 'cuz I need those pies in my mouth faster) blocks in order to get my fix in the future.  I meant to save one of the pies for later... well, that didn't happen.  Can't wait to stop in again & try the savory pies.  I've heard the chicken pot pies are phenomenal."}
{"text":"Jennifer is the owner and is a real sweetheart.I had the blackberry pie and it was fantastic. What a geam in such a beautiful city."}
{"text":"The food is amazing, we had a quiche ,pasty and marscapone tart. It was reasonably priced. The pasty might have been the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"Humble is probably the only \"pie\" shop in the whole Madison.

I went in wanting to try their \"pasty\", which is a common thing among the Commonwealth...

They have a wide selection of sweet pastries and pies, and two daily special savory options. We tried the roast beef with caramelized onions pasty, it was really tasty, EXPECT, it's not really what pasty is (to me at least).. The typical pasty would use more minced like meat and gravy like sauces...

I still really like their pies nonetheless! I wish they would have more savory options is all!"}
{"text":"My family and I made a trip to Humble a couple of Saturdays ago.  Everything in the case looked so good...we basically got one of everything! ;) Okay, not really, but we did get four things for two adults!  My favorite was the mini key-lime pie. I was expecting the crust to be hard, but it was a perfect flaky pastry crust. We also had two hand pies - one blueberry bourbon (my least favorite, but still excellent) and one apple ginger raspberry (so good!). My second favorite item was a mini sour cherry pie, which was so fresh and tart.  My husband I were pretty much fighting over the cherry pie!  My only sadness was that none of the savory pies were vegetarian friendly that day, so I didn't get one - but I will be back to check out their selection!  The guy working was incredibly friendly and helpful - the whole experience was fantastic. Go there! Now!"}
{"text":"Absolutely Delicious! Last week I had lemon lavender, gingerberry and apple! All three were remarkable! The crust was crispy, flavorful and absolutely everything a crust should be! The fillings were fresh, made with real fruit, spices and most importantly lots of love! I have been thinking about returning all week and am so excited for the opportunity to drive from Milwaukee to Madison to visit again today! I hope the people in Madison know how lucky they are for a bakery that uses fresh ingredients and not pie filling from a bakery supply company. Wake up Madison and eat the pie, it's amazing!"}
{"text":"Oh my yum! 

I don't even remember the name of the my favorite thing I got there. It was something hazel nutty that kind of resembled a pop tart. Sweet swirling asparagus tips it was that good! This is definitely a place I will come back to when I am in need of a sweet treat!"}
{"text":"I've only tasted one of their pies.  It was incredibly delicious, so I'm taking the time to post a review.  We had their wild blueberry pie.  The crust is fantastic - light, flakey, and, hands down the best I've ever tasted.  The blueberry filling was also awesome - loads of fruit, definitely wild (judging from their small size), perfect amount of sweetness (didn't overpower), and a really nice lemony flavor as a complement.  The people I interacted with were kind and helpful.  The pricing seems to reflect the outstanding quality of their products.  We'll definitely be back to test out that hypothesis, both for their sweet and savory goodies."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE! I have been frequenting this shop regularly since they first opened several years ago. Everything I've tried has been delicious and the service is always great. The (soon-to-be-previous) owners always made time to talk to customers and make sure things were running smoothly--even when they were busy baking in the back. It's great for students during lunch (or cutting class)!"}
{"text":"Delicious!  After enjoying both the savory and sweet pies at Humble, I have no reservations about declaring that they are hands-down the most delectable pies I have ever tried!  I am not usually someone who eats pie crust, but in this case, the crust is one of my favorite parts.  Visit once and you'll be hooked!"}
{"text":"Fantastic pie shop. They offer sweet and savory in all kinds of forms: mini pies, hand pies, quiches (not really a pie but you get the idea). Flavors rotate with the season and very often they have flavor combinations I've never seen elsewhere such as peach bourbon, blueberry balsamic, honey lemon apple. They also have more traditional ones like tart cherry and chocolate. As other reviewers have noted, the crust is where it's at. Don't get me wrong, the fillings are delish but the crusts here are phenomenal. The owner is a lovely lady who loves to bake. Her love of baking really shines through when she talks. They do events too, including weddings."}
{"text":"While in Madison, Humble was one of my must go to spots. I'm sad it didn't give me the feelings of happiness and nomz as much as I had hoped for. When I walk into a pie shop, I expect warmth in service and it just wasn't there. I think that tainted my whole experience here. Don't get me wrong, the lady working wasn't rude she just was cold and rather uninviting.

Humble has cool decor and a few tables if you'd like to dine in. Or you can take the little pies to go. It was a little pricey but I thoroughly enjoyed the chocolate dessert I grabbed from here. I was also a bit disappointed that there wasn't a bigger selection - just 4 types available the day we went.

The pie is good, service leaves a bit to be desired, a little pricey and would like to see more variety in pie selection."}
{"text":"We ordered an apple and a cherry pie for Thanksgiving.  I thought the price was excessive for pie.  In fairness they were loaded with good fruit, but still.

Both were overbaked and had waaay too much crust.  Perhaps it the deluge of holiday orders.  I can't say.  Next time I want a pie, I'll look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Best catch: free coffee all day every day! Everything is very homey and the baked goods are not too sweet. I love the quiche both savory and sweet. As a student it was a great place for me to just camp there, enjoy the good food and free coffee and a nice view from the window"}
{"text":"Cheers to pies: the unsung heroes of desserts. They do indeed deserve their own bake shop! This place was cute and the pies I tried were delectable. The crust was perfectly buttery and flakey, and the ingredient combos were well thought out. It's easy to spend a lot of money here.... But it's justifiable if you treat each pie as a work of art! The savory pies are my fav; they remind me of Mom's chicken pot pie :)"}
{"text":"Allow me to re-introduce myself!  

My original lemon meringue pie was runny, and I should have mentioned it straight away to Humble, but I didn't.  Instead I just complained about it on Yelp.  Despite this lapse in judgement, the folks at Humble contacted me saying this was most likely the fault of a malfunctioning oven and that they would like to make me a new one free of charge.  I took them up on this offer and the second one was outstanding in every way.  It held together as expected, and it tasted fantastic.  They also gave me a 25 dollar gift certificate to use for next time!    

Their customer service went above and beyond, and I could tell they really, REALLY wanted to make it right.  This was wonderfully refreshing, especially nowadays where most consumers are made to feel like just another number.  

Thank you ladies, your pies are wonderful, and so are you!"}
{"text":"Tried Humble's pastries at recent Octopi Brewery anniversary event.  Owner's partner was manning a table inside brewery with a beautiful variety of treats - mini fruit crumble tarts, pecan pie, chocolate pretzel pie, and these INCREDIBLE fig and brown sugar \"toaster pastries\" - light flaky crust encasing delicious fig and brown sugar filling.  Seriously good.  It took all my willpower to save a couple of bites for my boyfriend so he could try it. 

Woman owned bakery!!  Hooray!!  And easy to support, because she makes DELICIOUS THINGS that you will continue to think about long after you've finished the last crumbs.

Pastries ranged in price but hovered around $4.50 price per.  For anyone who is accustomed to spending $1-2 on a donut for their sugar fix, don't be cheap.  These goods are worth every penny.  Treat yourself, you deserve it. 

Support Humble and help them thrive so we have them forever.

Sorry no photos.  We spent our time eating, rather than photographing what we were gonna eat.  ;)"}
{"text":"Pie on a scorching day! Why not!!

Our Order : Strawberry Rhubarb, Mixed Berry, Lemon Apple, Salted Caramel Fudge

Price : $4 on an average per pie (Some I think were $5)

I like their take on the \"shape\" of the pie as the first 3 above mimicked a calzone and the last one had a flower pot kinda appearance. Interesting and appreciate the creativity here!

As we all know, the most important but underrated part of a pie is the Crust. I was so happy with the fact that their's was..well Crusty!!  You could identify the flaky layers and the butteryness of the crust almost instantly. The fillings, although macerated, were very tasty. I do wish they kept some actual chunks of fruit in there to get that bite as compliment !

The lady at the counter did tell me that they periodically change their flavors, so excited for my next pie tete-a-tete!!"}
{"text":"Pies.  Little pies. Big pies. But no slices.

Ventured here on the day of their grand opening on Allen St.  They had several flavors of sweet mini pies, 2 types of savory pies (margarita pizza, root vegetable), pinch pies (turnover style), \"pop tart\" style pastries, and 1 type of cookie.  They had the most variety of mini sweet pies and I tried the caramlized banana (banana filling with whip cream) and chocolate (chocolate cream with whip). Humble also serves coffee and Cha Cha tea.

The real problem here is ratio.  If you love the outer crust of a pie, this is a great choice for you. Personally, I find the edge of a pie to be more hard and less flaky than my liking, and you really get a lot of it vs filling when the diameter of the pie is decreased. The fillings were good, but not super outstanding. Overall, a slice is typically a better value (mini pie was $4 and smaller than a typical restaurant slice) and a better crust to filling ratio.  Start serving slices, Humble, and I may change my mind!"}
{"text":"The disclaimer: I'm confident my 4-star review will be raised after subsequent visits. They are a relatively new business and god knows it can take a bit to work out the kinks! I love supporting local & sustainable businesses so I will be back.

The background: Some friends and I stopped in on a Sunday afternoon looking to sit and have some coffee & pastries.

The good: Fantastic service! From the girl at the register to the woman who brought our drinks to the woman whom I presume to be one of the owners I watched interact with a somewhat difficult customer, I was impressed with everyone's warmth & professionalism. The decor is also super cute, and they have a little stash of games to play while you eat--we played a couple rounds of Bananagrams, which was rad. They also make a mean thai iced coffee with grounds from Just Coffee Coop. And free wifi!

The needs work: My blackberry balsamic hand pie was $4 and very small (I ate it in about 4 bites). The price seems high for Madison, but all ingredients are locally sourced so perhaps that's why. The girl at the register asked if I'd like it warmed up; I said yes, but I wish I hadn't, because she microwaved it and it took all potential crisp out of the crust and turned the pie pretty soggy. It also zapped some of the flavor out of the pie--you know how things just never taste as good after they're microwaved? Suggestion: a toaster oven! And if possible, larger hand pies.

The conclusion: Loved the atmosphere, loved the business model, will keep them in mind for any baked goods order needs and a place to spend a cozy afternoon (next time sans microwaved pie.)"}
{"text":"Y'all. Let. Me. Tell. You. 

BEST DECISION EVER! 

I didn't know this place existed until I followed a food blogger from the area and she posted pictures. Then I started following on Instagram and I HAD TO TRY IT. I was compelled by the beautiful pictures of the sweet and savory treats. 

For my first visit, I tried the Monte Crusto and the Honeyed Strawberry Marscapone Tart. One of the best decisions of my life. I also grabbed a slice of the quiche to take with me for breakfast the next day.

Monte Crusto: every bite was a bite that was so good I almost cried at the last one. Filled with ham, Swiss cheese, mustard and cherry jam (with cherries), I didn't know what to expect. I didn't know the cherry jam and the mustard would go so well together. It was divine. I thought I died and was in another realm. Must try this if you eat pork. 

Honeyed Strawberry Marscapone Tart: this is one of the tarts I saw on instagram and I wanted to give it a try in person. I learned that the strawberries are local! The sweetness from honeyed strawberries was so refreshing. The flakiness of the crust. Wow. Wow. Wow. So many layers. Every bite. Every Strawberry. The Marscapone was perfectly paired with the strawberries. 

Seating: a couple of tables inside and a couple outside. Restroom available. 

Overall---I couldn't stop thinking about every bite. Everything else looked amazing. I can't wait to go back and try other things."}
{"text":"I drive by this place everyday on my way to and from work and always sit at the stoplight tempted to go in. But i'm always in a rush to get to work or tired on my way home. But! One day I parked the car and finally made it in. The interior is a cute space with some seats available. 

I ended up getting one savory and one sweet pie. The bacon Swiss and leek savory and blueberry bourbon pie.

I appreciate that they use an all butter crust. It tasted homemade and I mean that in the good sense. The bacon Swiss and leek was very good. Blueberry bourbon was not overly sugary so I got to enjoy the flavors. 

These pies are a little bit on the pricier side for me so I would only go there as a special treat. But I will definitely stop by sometime again."}
{"text":"Humble makes some of the best crust I've ever had. I am not usually a crust person (the calorie to enjoyment ratio isn't there for me most of the time), but I would eat their crust straight. In fact, the crust was my favorite part of their Monte Crusto. 

The Monte Crusto was a savory pocket pie filled with ham, Swiss, chunky cherry jam, and spicy mustard. Again, I can not overstate the magic of their crust on this dish, and the combo of cherries and mustard was stellar. The ham in my pie had a lot of connective tissue that made it impossible to cut with my fork and really difficult to chew. Without the ham it would have been a five-star experience, but gristle really, really puts me off. 

I also sampled the salted honey tart and the honey lemon apple hand pie. The apple pie was light and delicious, with the honey being more prevalent in the mouth feel than the taste. The lemon was subtle. The salted honey tart was decadent. The consistency was similar to a chess filling and honey truly was the star of this delicious little pie. 

The owner/baker who served us couldn't have been nicer about our indecision and very vocal tasting experience - we dined in and didn't hold back with how delicious everything was. 

Humble is on the pricier side, but you get what you pay for and what you pay for is quality. Looking forward to going back and exploring some other pie options!"}
{"text":"I was walking around the neighborhood and saw this place was open in the old Barber Shop.  (What happened to Savory?)  Yay!  So I went in.  The display case was very tempting, but I am the world's biggest cherry fan, so I got a cherry galette -- a little bit larger than the cherry danish at La Brioche -- and a Salted Caramel Poptart.  There were also chocolate/peanut poptarts, Brown sugar/cinnamon poptarts, and hazelnut.  And a whole lot of savory pies -- but I'm a fruit pie type of guy -- and a nice looking gluten free chocolate cream pie on a nut crust.  I have the feeling that any pie you requested could be made.

The Cherry galette was delicious.  The tartness of the cherries shone through (I've lost count about the number of overly sweetened tart cherry pies I've had) beautifully and the crust was buttery and flaky -- but it didn't fall apart while you ate it, so it's not too flaky if you know what I mean.  Just right!

I'm sorry they're not open before I go to work.  These would be perfect for something to take into the office.  The poptarts would go over very well -- the salted caramel was a nice combo of sweet and salty.

I eagerly await peach season.  Fresh peach pie is second to none -- except maybe sour cherries! -- in my opinion."}
{"text":"I loved the Reuben Pasty--corned beef, Swiss cheese, sauerkraut and home made Russian Dressing all wrapped up in a yummy crust. It was perfect. 

The Blueberry Raspberry Hand Pie and Root Beer Float Petite Pie were pretty good. 

The shop is cute and very clean. There were two tables available for dining in."}
{"text":"Balsamic Blueberry hand pie and sour cherry galette. Hands down the best petite pies I have had in Madison. The drink menu also sparked an interest for a second visit. They have Vietnamese coffee and various teas that I would like to try in the future. The pies had the flakiest and most delightful crust with the freshest fruits and mixture of flavors to balance out that light airiness. 

Seasonal menus make it even more worth the try. Was about $4 for each pie."}
{"text":"Fantastic local business. The pie selection is great, and their catering is very accommodating and professional."}
{"text":"I had a apple pie and it was wonderful.  I ate it so quickly, I had to order the banana cream pie to go...$4 per slice was a bit steep but because they were so tasty and the place had so much character, I think they can get away with it.  It is great to have another place to go to just hang out, rather than having to go to a cupcake place, because naturally, that is the other place I hang out...

The apple pie crust was on point.  I dislike dry crusts but this was very moist and sweet.  The banana cream pie was more of a cup like crust and that one was a bit \"crustier.\"  It was not my favorite crust but the filling was great.

They also give free coffee to students.  I told them I was a teacher and he gave me the coffee anyways (not sure if this is for all teachers).  The store itself is kind of small but I love the personality of it.  They use a lot of local products.  The staff was also friendly and personable.  They wanted to know what I thought of the food and carried on a small conversation.  I will be back, and can not wait for fall pies!!"}
{"text":"Ohmygosh, these pies are absolutely amazing.  The crust is insane.  So flaky, crisp, and delicious, and the flavors are completely addictive.  I had driven past this bakery several times before stopping in, and I am SO glad I did.  I had an incredible ham, turkey, cheese, and cherry pie (I think?), and it was absolutely phenomenal.  A perfect blend of sweet, savory, flaky, and buttery.

The owner and baker, Jennifer, is so incredibly nice, and we can't wait to support her small business more.

You. Must. Go."}
{"text":"Humble Pie did a great job for our wedding. We had a threesome of summer pies: Sour Cherry, Mixed Berry Thyme, and Strawberry Currant. The round 9 inch pies were beautiful and tasty and the slab pies (feeds about 20-30 a slab) looked great and tasted even better! Service was great and planning with them was easy. Their savory pies which we try whenever we stop by the store were also great (especially the Chicken Pot Pie Pasty). Could not recommend them more highly!"}
{"text":"I have to say up front that I have not yet been in to visit the Humble shop in Middleton, so this review is for the pies only. That being said, these pies are GREAT! I had read about Humble here on yelp as well as other local publications, so when we decided to purchase Thanksgiving day desserts instead of make them I knew this was the chance to try them out. We put in our order for two pies a few days before Thanksgiving and picked them up the day before. Here's what we had:

Apple pie: This was the first Humble pie I tasted and it was both very good and VERY surprising. The crust is quite thick and holds up well even with a slightly juicy filling like apple. The top crust is latticed with thick strands of crust sprinkled liberally with spices. I was surprised at how thick the crust was, but also at how tasty it is. Very buttery and not at all dry, the crust is a welcome accompaniment to a number of different filings. The filling for the apple pie was also very surprising, again in a good way. The apples themselves retain a nice consistency and while there's sweetness in the filling it's not at all cloying. There's also a huge hit of flavor in the filling from what I'm guessing is at least a few different spices. I think I got a bit of cinnamon, maybe a little nutmeg, and quite a bit of clove. This is a very different approach to apple pie than you'll see many other places and it is a HUGELY welcome bit of variety. 

Pecan pie: A bit more conventional than the apple, but again VERY good. The best thing about the pecan pie was the ratio of pecans to 'corn syrup goo' in the filling. Don't get me wrong, I love that goo, but what I REALLY love is nutty, delicious pecans. This was a GREAT representation of a pecan pie because the leading flavor was pecan! Similar to the apple pie there was nothing cloying about this version of pecan, which was hugely welcome. I also really like the little accent of cream frosting as well. This added a lot to the overall taste of the pie, and again was not overwhelming. 

The thing that really sets Humble pies apart for me is the balance of flavors. No one aspect overshadows the others. I really enjoy a good pie, and these are among the best I've had! I'm sure it's starting to sound redundant, but the fact that these pies are not teeth achingly sweet is so welcome and (perhaps unfortunately) really surprising. I'm excited to visit Humble myself soon and perhaps try one of their more unconventional offerings. If they're as good as these stalwart favorites I'll be back again to give another 5 star review!"}
{"text":"I love Humble.

I've been here twice, once on Pi day last year and once on Pi day this year.

ATTENTION PEOPLE LOOKING FOR PIES ON PI DAY:
IF IT IS PI DAY (MARCH 14) THIS PLACE IS GOING TO BE PRETTY BUSY.
If you actually want a decent selection of pies, I would NOT suggest coming within an hour of close. They tend to run out near the end of the day and have limited selection.

As far as the pies...they taste amazing and that is all I need to say. I would eat them for breakfast, lunch, and dinner if I could. The end."}
{"text":"Pie is good. But pecan and cardamom sweet potato pie is really good. 

The spiced flavor of the pie makes for a serious party in your mouth. Picture a cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, cardamom and clove-type explosion. This pie packs a punch in terms of quality fall spices. 

That's not to mention the freshness of the main sweet potato component itself. The texture of the pie is beautifully reminiscent of a pumpkin pie, yet this version is amped up in terms of flavor profiles.

It is not cloyingly sweet, as similar pumpkin pies often are. With this pie, Humble shows how versatile an ingredient like sweet potato is; its applicability spans from savory fare to sweet.

Humble, you've done it again."}
{"text":"Love this place.  I have been searching for somewhere that made pies as good as my dad's and these people nailed it.  For me it is all in the crust and their crust is very flaky.  We stopped in on a Saturday and the shop is cute and cozy.  Just a little random trivia...it used to be a barbershop years ago.  I had a sweet potato cardamom tart and took a Fall Apple tart home with me.  Both were delicious.  I will definitely go back to try the savory pies, but I have found my new go to place for pie when the craving hits."}
{"text":"Great taste, but if you eat them on-site and want them warm, they microwave them, which as anyone who's ever microwaved pie knows is less than ideal. Free (hot) coffee for students and free wifi is a nice touch, so if they had a toaster oven for in-house pies this would be a 5-star review. Also note: they add tax to price if you eat on-site but take it out of listed price if you get food to go."}
