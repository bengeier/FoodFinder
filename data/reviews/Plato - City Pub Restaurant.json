{"text":"Plato Restaurant, Lounge and Bar is tucked away in a stripmall right next to the Bottle Depot on 37th St SW.  As such, you're afforded a glimpse into the life cycle of a beer bottle if you happen to be out front smoking a cigarette.  We drink the shiny, pretty beer, rarely considering that ultimately it may end up a dirty dime at the bottom of some dude's shopping cart.  But enough about that.  
If you want to get a sense of the place, check out their website - to say that it's detailed would be an understatement!
The lounge is dimly lit, much of the light being supplied by the bank of VLTS.  There is a pool table, and best of all, a well stocked old-fashioned jukebox.  Owing to its location, there's a pretty eclectic crowd in the lounge.  Let's call it.....Blue Collar.  Yeah, that'll do it.  All in all, a damned fine place to listen to a little Johnny Cash while drinking a cold one."}
{"text":"Ordered online through an ordering service I've used in the past to order from this place.  It was prepaid and generally I've had no issues.  After waiting over an hour and a bit for my food to arrive I got a bit worried and called the restaurant only to be told that my order had been cancelled without anyone telling me?  The man who picked up the phone then began raising his voice to me and repeatedly telling me it was the websites problem and not his; though after checking with the site it said the order was cancelled by the restaurant.  He was incredibly rude and nearly screaming over the phone, despite the fact I was being well mannered in comparison.

I'm really upset because I love the food here, but being screamed at for asking a simple question by someone I presume is the manager is just not worth it.  If you don't want to take orders from a certain website anymore you should just remove your restaurant from it.  It will save you from looking like an unprofessional prick and losing a customer who's been ordering from you for over two decades!"}
{"text":"Was extremely dissapointed with the quality of food. The fish looked and tasted like fishsticks from walmart. The garlic toast and calamari was tasteless. The baked potato was offensive. The only good part of the meal was the rice, which i made (this was delivery). Both Plato and Socrates would not approve!!!!"}
{"text":"The pizzas, pastas and salads are absolutely tasty. However every time I have been here there is drama...in fact the waitress just told two customers to take it outside as I am writing this...I'm thinking about calling the cops. So...the food is great...I would phone it in and pick it up or have it delivered. Oh yeah the service was terrible but who can blame her when she has to babysit!"}
{"text":"just one review on this place?!  This is a great neighbourhood pub/restaurant with some pretty good lunch specials too.  Heritage-like decor, more like a Greek feeling.

And the pub side on the right, got some arcade games too.

Located in a big plaza, on the edge, with free parking.

Offer delivery too

Friendly service."}
{"text":"I've ordered a few things from here - baked lasagna, shrimp caesar, and the #24 pizza. 

The lasagna was delicious. The shrimp caesar was good but a bit wet for my liking. The garlic toast was perfect. And the pizza.....is the best I've had in years. 

My delivery experiences from Plato's are always great. The food comes quickly and the driver is always friendly. 

Definitely give this place a try. I have very high standards coming from Vancouver!!"}
{"text":"I can't believe the language from the owner today. We had ordered 2 steak sandwiches and got them to go. Upon opening the boxes, there was only steak! I called and the owner blew a gasket, to me he said to F%#k off and hung up. I called back and he threatened to sue me and again swore in the same manner and hung up. 
The food is great, the waitresses are top shelf but this malota, owner of such a nice place should treat his customers with respect. This will be posted everywhere mr owner"}
{"text":"This is a blast from the past! Good quality food and service. Local owners, local employees great value"}
