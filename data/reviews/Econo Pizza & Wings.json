{"text":"Great Pizza and a great value! This is so far the best pizza we've found in the Newmarket/Aurora area. And for $10 (large 3-topping) you can't go wrong! We love stopping by and picking one up and then sitting at the Commons wading pool across the road.

The box fits perfectly on the tables over there and fits perfectly in the recycling bins too!

The place is 'hidden' in the basement of the bank, around back, and the only reason we found out about it was because we were walking by! Thankfully!

The name just doesn't do the place justice!"}
{"text":"Great pizza. Great price. Location is not easy to find for first timers as it is behind the building. Less than many other pizza joints and delivers on taste."}
{"text":"Best Value pizza in Newmarket. $9.99 for a Large 3 Topping pizza."}
{"text":"The food is always great and fresh the pizza's are great and their burgers are also fantastic especially their bacon cheeseburgers.  They aim to please. The establishment is small the owners are very kind and when I was in the hospital with pneumonia, they even  delivered my food to my room.  I give this family run business thumbs up.  It is also very affordable."}
