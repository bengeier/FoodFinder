{"text":"Just ordered delivery from this place and the food is great and the lady on the phone was really nice but the delivery guy took $10 of my change after I had already given him his tip and once I had realized it he was already in his car driving away. Really not cool."}
{"text":"Called ahead and ordered a large Hawaiian pizza and it was more than enough for the family of four. Probably the best Hawaiian pizza I've had."}
{"text":"I think that this is the best pizza in down town Pittsburgh. I don't even bother with toppings it's amazing plain. Get it well done."}
{"text":"Sadly, this was a disappointment. To give some credit, we've been here for slices on walks home from the ballpark and were very satisfied - but what was delievered to our house the other night was terrible. For one, the pizza looked like it had experienced a head on collision in the box, the cheese/toppings were displaced over to one side and the lid a mess. For two, it was watery. For three, the sauce is terrible, nothing about is fresh tasting - overly sweet and like its poured directly out of the can onto the pie. 

It used to be that Ephesus was the best pizza delievery in the Southside - but then something changed with their pizza and we are scrambling to find a replacement. Giovanni's wont be it. 

Too bad Doughboy's doesn't deliever."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza, fast delivery.  I thought the pasta we preferred was a little oily, but my boyfriend thought it was perfect.  Definitely one of the best delivery pizza choices in the Mt. Lebanon area. We get it every time we want pizza."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I walk past Giovanni's almost every day and the smell blowing out from the door is INCREDIBLE. Finally we decided to order something for delivery and see how it was.
We were severely disappointed.
My girlfriend tried the buffalo chicken salad with french fries. I ordered penne noodles with marinara sauce. We decided to share an order of cheese bread twists and a slice of cheesecake.
My girlfriend's salad was basically a few shreds of iceberg lettuce slathered in mediocre, overly-spicy buffalo sauce. The chicken and fries were cold.
The pasta was nice and hot, but I found the marina sauce to taste bland and ketchup-ish, almost like they had dumped a cup of corn syrup in the mix. It was freaky.
I was surprised that the cheese bread thing was so highly rated because ours was doughy, cold, and we weren't even sure if cheese was involved. The marinara dipping sauce was the same as what was on my pasta- ketchup-y, sharp, and basically flavorless.
The cheesecake was actually pretty good, flavor-wise. Perfectly sweet. However, the consistency was almost identical to that of a half-melted tub of frosting. The whole thing was a gooey mess, spilling over the sides of the crust.
Our experience was incredibly disappointing and we ended up throwing most of the food away. I could have set aflame forty bucks and felt about the same.
That being said, we didn't even try pizza. Maybe that's better, but we won't be taking the risk to find out."}
{"text":"This place is great. They do take out and dine in. The basic house salad comes with the best tasting green olives, tomato, onions, cucumber, a slice of provolone cheese and salami. Their pizzas are great!  Wonderful ingredients and probably the best pizza in the Concord/Kannapolis area."}
{"text":"Giovanni's has great Italian food in a laid-back, casual atmosphere.  The best part for us was their gluten free offerings and the staff's thoughtfulness in accommodating diners with gluten intolerance.  My wife has Coeliacs, and the availability of gluten free garlic bread, baked in a separate oven and complete with separate dipping oil to avoid cross contamination, along with the variety of gluten free pasta, combined to make our dining experience complete and free from the worry of gluten contamination!"}
{"text":"GREAT pizza, kind of a dingy little place downtown though. But the pizza is oh so good"}
{"text":"Took a little long for delivery but that is to be expected during busy Times....as far as the food goes it was perfect and I will be ordering here again."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza! I tried a bunch of other places that deliver to me (I live near downtown), but this wins hands down. I crave this pizza. It's so greasy and good and almost nothing compares. I love how much cheese they put and it feels like its clogging my arteries but I really don't care. This place is seriously addicting. I don't know what they put int their sauce. The crust is actually really good too. I usually hate the crust."}
{"text":"They have gluten free pizza that is pretty okay!  And gluten free chocolate covered pretzels!  Oh yeah!"}
{"text":"This is absolutely my favorite hidden gem in Pittsburgh. I stumbled upon it one night while downtown at night and now I order it almost every week. The sauce on the pizza is sweet and AMAZING. I have never tasted pizza so good in my entire life! Love it. I would give it 10 stars if i could!"}
{"text":"Was the only place open on Easter Sunday. The pizza was dry and tasted like it had been sitting there since Good Friday."}
{"text":"This place may have decent pizza but its hard to get past the horrible customer service and the fact that they basically only deliver when they want. Tried to order delivery at 9:20 on a Saturday and was told they are no longer doing deliveries. I've also been deterred from ordering from them before because the person who answered said it would be over 2 hours for delivery, It was a Thursday in concord nc, i drove by after the call on my way to the grocery store and guess what? They were dead as hell. The manager also argued with me over burnt bruschetta saying that bruschetta meant burnt toast. GTFO why did they not teach me this at culinary school?! The pizza is pretty good but only order enough to eat while its fresh because it is so greasy it sucks reheated."}
{"text":"Terrible! Ordered chicken piccata for delivery. It was slimy, soggy, and not fit to eat. The delivery guy was rude. Never ever again"}
{"text":"Sooo.....I am talking to my elderly Aunt, who lives in Concord and isn't driving these days because she a little weak and feeble, and she tells me, she didn't have much food in the house....she hadn't eaten today, and she hadn't been to the store....as she had been fasting.....I decided then....I'd order something to be delivered to her. I live 3 hours away.....so I got online and found this restaurant, that delivers, and decided to try them for the first time. I ordered her a salad, (put in a bowl) and (10) sweet, baked bbq wings....flats...I made the order at 7:10...as of the confirmation via email....which said the order should arrive in 45 minutes. 

Ok....I call my Aunt to let her know I am having food delivered to her, so she won't think it's a hoax, and that I would stay on the phone while we wait for it to arrive....at 8:05pm when it had not arrived, I called the restaurant, for the first time to see if there were any problems, or if the driver had gotten lost, as the store was only 5 miles away, but before I could finish the question, I was cut off and told the driver was on the way....At 8:18pm, a pleasant delivery driver arrives and delivers the food...I allowed my Aunt to eat her food...

I called back around 9:00pm to see how she liked the food and to determine whether to use them again, when she tells me that the chicken was too strong and she couldn't eat them.  Again, my Aunt is older, and her taste buds aren't the best.....She can taste sweetness and saltiness....and she can sense hotness.... and she is not fond of hot food...which is why I ordered the sweet bbq wings.

So, because she could not eat them, and because I had ordered sweet bbq wings, from a store I was not familiar with, I called them back and very politely asked the young man, who answered the phone if all their wings were hot, and then told him that I had ordered sweet bbq wings and wondered if they were  supposed to hot? He nervously stated that they are not usually, but perhaps the person who made them had put too much seasoning on them.... I asked then if I could get a credit on the next order, for these wings, since they were too hot for her to eat....He said that he could put it on the account, but he had to go through a manager....I said ok. Conversation at that point was very civil... 

This young man promptly hands the phone off to somone, who says his name was Mike, and begins the conversation with, 'What can I do for you?' I begin telling him that the wings were too hot and he interrupts me to ask for the address the order went to, so that he could pull up the order. I give him the address, he pulls up the order and begins to tell me how their sauce is made at the store, that it's all the same and that it is not that hot....then proceeds to tell me how he is about to go drop a wing in the fryer to see if it is that hot and if someone had put too much cayenne pepper on it....followed by, I am going to put a credit on the account this time, but I am not going to give you a credit everytime....so what I suggest is you don't order the wings anymore.'  I think to my self...How rude and presumptuous... What manager tells a customer this... Only customers you have no respect for are spoken to this way...

But this is the response I get as a first time customer, 3 hrs away who has never ordered from this restaurant.....smh....if this is their idea of customer service, then perhaps i should take his advice....and not only, not order their wings....but nothing else from them, ever....

I can see if I had been belligerent, but I never raised my voice, suggested anything out of the way, or asked for anything that any customer shouldn't be able to ask for...I simply asked for a credit off the bill for receiving something that I didn't order....not credit for the entire bill....

Now, because of his poor Management skills....this place will not worry about my ordering from them again.... Oh...and I'm still waiting to see if that wing that he said he was going to drop in the fryer was too spicy or not...that really makes sense....perhaps coming to get the wings that were delivered to her and seeing how hot they were would make better sense...

Oh well.....so much for that credit....."}
{"text":"Tasty, tasty, tasty. 

Only place in the immediate area open on Thanksgiving, and boy were we glad. Much of their stuff is freshly made, great people, and decent prices. 

I had the grilled chicken salad with homemade Greek dressing -- everything prepared fresh except the cold vegetables, which were cut that morning -- and homemade Chicken Vegetable soup. Came with a healthy slice (as in size, not nutrition value) of garlic bread. Awesome. Came out quick, tasted great. Salad had a blend of mozzarella and provolone cheese on it which added to the flavor. Veggies were crisp. Chicken was seasoned lightly and warm. Didn't get to the Greek dressing -- are the salad too quickly. I could leave the soup; kinda bland and not much chicken, but at least it was part of a $7.99 lunch special (small salad, soup, garlic bread). 

I'm here on business so I'm not sure I'll ever be back, but if you're around you should go. Perfect for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Giovanni's on W. Liberty is the only place we order pizza delivery from.  During peak delivery times it can take a while before you get your order but it's totally worth the wait!  You can order online and they even have an app for your phone (although it never worked for me, but then again I am totally inept with smartphone technology).  We always get the large pizza (1 topping), cheesy bread and soda online special.  Get extra marinara because you will want to drink this stuff!  They really cheese up the pizza (and this is coming from a cheese lover), so last time I asked my husband if I should order it with light cheese and he looked at me like I had two heads.  Just be prepared, first timers, before you order extra cheese.  This is cheesy, greasy salty pizza goodness, folks, so if you're counting your weight watcher points, then this place is probably not the best option for you."}
{"text":"HALF-BAKED. We ordered a large pizza for delivery, the cost was exorbitant at $27. It arrived with the crust  nearly raw. It was practically inedible and we felt disappointed and ripped off.  We could have had a much better dinner at another restaurant for our $27. 
Maybe it's better if you eat in,  but I can't recommend their delivery service food."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good pizza was delivered to my hotel room in one hour on a very busy night after the Steelers/pats game. I had the 4 cheese pizza. I would order from here again when I'm back in town."}
{"text":"I've given Giovanni's about 7-10 chances over the course of 3 months, and I'm done.  The first time I got a specialty pizza from them it was amazing, and every time after that it's either been burnt or cold or covered in grease.

I might be able to come to terms with the long wait and the barely adequate customer service (at least with delivery and pick up, I've never sat down and eaten in the restaurant, though I have exchanged pleasantries with one of the waitresses and she seems friendly) if the food were consistently good, but it's not.

I've done call ahead pick-up, I've done order and wait for it pick up, and I've done delivery through their website.

The last time I ordered and picked up, they gave me the wrong pizza and I didn't realize it til I got home (my fault to a point, I probably should've looked at it).  It had onions and mushrooms on it, which I don't like, so it wasn't like I could just eat it anyway.  I called them and the guy asked: \"What you want me to do?  You want I deliver new pizza, you want credit, or you want pick up new pizza?\"

I feel I should note that I used to work as a server.  I realize mistakes happen.  Despite being hungry, tired, and frustrated, I made sure I was pleasant-- I did not insult anyone or raise my voice.

Based on my previous experience with delivery with them and the facts that I didn't want to wait 45 minutes for a new pizza and I'd already put $2 in the tip jar at the counter and didn't want to tip a delivery driver on top of that, I drove back and got a new (correct) pizza, which was smothered in cheese (I originally had asked for them to go easy on the cheese).  

The guy apologized 3-4  times, which I appreciate, and it seemed that I got a lot of extra toppings on the new (correctly made) pizza, but I found it extremely disappointing that a handful of apologies was my only compensation for being an understanding customer (\"Hey man, it's cool, it's just a pizza, no one died,\" is something that I said.)  

I feel I should've been offered a discount on my next order or offered a free dessert or breadsticks or something to compensate for the fact that I had to drive back to get my order correct.  Now, maybe I should've SAID that (\"Hey, uh, can I get a discount on my next order or get a free dessert or something?\"), but I don't feel that as a customer I should have to make suggestions.  I once witnessed a couple go in there and complain that they'd been waiting an hour for delivery.  They were handed their order free.  So I'm nice, drive back to pick up my order when they got it wrong, and I get compensated with a few extra pieces of chicken and some cheese that I didn't want on my new correct order?  I guess the squeaky wheel really does get the most grease.

Unfortunately for them, this was their last chance with me.  As I mentioned, out of anywhere from 7-10 chances over the course of 3 months, they've disappointed me more often than they've dazzled me.  As soon as I opened that box and got the wrong pizza I turned to my husband and said: \"That's it, we're never going to Giovanni's again.\"  With his mouth full of hoagie he asked:  \"Aww, are you sure?  Because this hoagie's really good,\" and I replied: \"Well, let me see if they can make it up to me,\" and they didn't.

So if you wanna roll the dice, you might have some amazing pizza, but you also might have to wait half an hour for something cold or burnt.  Best of luck in gambling at Giovanni's."}
{"text":"I had my pizza delivered to the Wyndham, which gave the young man a hard time about parking to bring it in. Shame on you Wyndham.
I had a spinach and feta pizza which was divine! For me pizza must first have great crust. The crust on this pizza was perfect: crispy on the outer edge, fluffy and tender inside. The toppings were a perfect balance of cheese, spinach and onions (I asked them to hold the shrooms and they actually did). YUM! It arrived hot and, dare I say it again, perfect. THANK YOU GIOVANNI'S!
btw- I'm an Italian Pittsburgh native and i know good pizza."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've ever eaten!! Really and I'm a pizza and burrito guy and that's good! It's really hot and melts and fresh and delicious sauceJesus"}
{"text":"We have ordered pizza from Giovanni's over the years but tonight was the last night. We have now been waiting for close to two hours for our pizza. In an effort to simply cancel the order, we've tried calling for about 15 minutes and it's clear the phone is off the hook as we have consistently received a busy signal.  I love their pizza sauce, but I am fed up with the lack of service. Buyer beware!"}
{"text":"I usually order from this place because delivery is usually fast and pizzas are generally ok. Last week I ordered a medium pizza and cheese sticks. The delivery came fast and the delivery girl was really nice. But I think they got a different cook because the pizza was not as good as before and we couldn't even eat the cheese sticks. Also the medium pizza seemed like a small and we thought that the price was unreasonable. Not sure if I'm calling them again ;("}
{"text":"We ate at Giovanni's recently and were very happy with the service, food and portions. Clearly they take pride in making good food with large portions. My husband is gluten-free and they were knowledgable about the menu and processes to avoid contamination. Their customer service in person was excellent. The pasta dishes were nicely spiced and they even have gluten free meatballs! The atmosphere is no frills--a bit old but clean which allows the food to take center stage. This is my favorite kind of restaurant--good food, good portions, excellent prices, nice and knowledgable servers and good food preparation techniques (my husband knows within an hour if he has eaten gluten--unfortunately some places aren't careful even when you explain dietary needs)."}
{"text":"I was in Pittsburgh with friends for the 2013 Pirates opener.  Whatever you do, do NOT order a Gyro from here.  My friend ordered a Gyro and I couldn't help but be flabbergasted.  There were about 4 strips of lamb meat. Four!  The pita was able to close! That should not happen! It was a travesty to behold!  Pretty sure it was a pre-packaged frozen Gyro from the store, certainly not carved from a rotating spit. Not sure if all of Pittsburgh serves Gyros this way but it was a huge disappointment. 

Waitress and service were fine.."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped in on a weekend night because we needed something quick before an event at the Warhol. It's a pretty small shop--about three or four tables against the wall--and isn't the type of place you hang around after you're done eating. The register is located near the back of the shop, and the kitchen is at the front end.

We just got three slices of plain pizza, which cost $6. I'd probably need two or three slices for a full meal. They brought it out warm. It was good but not really outstanding in any way. I'll need to return when I have more time to try more items from their menu."}
{"text":"I just read a bunch of bad reviews but I also read a bunch of good ones. Well, that makes sense I guess because this sauce is a lot different than what most people are used to. So I wanted to add a really good review because I love it!  The sauce in this pizza is a lot sweeter than anything I've had elsewhere but I absolutely love it and the few people who I've introduced it to love it!  I think it's great! And their other foodstuffs are really good too, I've had a couple hoagies from here and they've always been really good."}
{"text":"Horrible experience.  Food not even here yet.  Ordered for delivery at 11am and call for an update at 1pm and say the order has just been made and is waiting for a driver.  Are you kidding me?  Did not offer any kind of discount just said do you want to cancel order or not.


Update:  After receiving the food I can say I was impressed with the pepperoni pizza and that it was hot and fresh.  I thought maybe it would have been sitting there since 11:15.  But still a 2 hour delivery is unacceptable.  I will order again and hopefully they will do better with delivery for me to upgrade the review again."}
{"text":"Yummy pizza. The garlic dipping sauce and sweet pizza sauce go well together. It was delivered hot and crisy in half the time they said. Super nice woman who answered the phone."}
{"text":"Typical pizza joint after a Northside event where all the hungry folklore including those under the influence of something are happy with anything open after 10 that isn't a frozen microwave pizza or Domino's / Pizza Hut garbage.  Not cheap but they got you..because they are open !"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Ordered rigatoni with marinara, a house salad , regular bread. The rigatoni was mush, literally falling apart  and a very small portion for the price tag. The salad was the same size as the side salad that my friend ordered with her meal for triple the price. The bread was burnt to a crisp. Two stars only for quick delivery."}
{"text":"This place is so gross went to pick up my pizza. Was greeted by cockroaches.  I can't believe this place has been around this long. If your thinking about ordering delivery. Go pick up your order this place is so dirty.  I really wonder how the the place is able to serve food. Plus the owner is a dick. His fethi he is Turkish not Italian like he tells everyone. Just a place to make the owner richer stay away!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and pizza. Highly recommend the jumbo provolone sticks. All the servers were very welcoming and eager to please. And to top it off a full case of chocolate treats for dessert made on location. Feel of an old time pizzeria and we loved it. Only problem was they could use more dine in seating."}
{"text":"The pizza stands out from most ordinary pizza places, by far the best pizza I've had in the pittsburgh area. The sause is sweet and the pizza is greasy like a Philly cheese steak hoogie.  Here delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"If I could leave 0 stars I would.  I got 3 of their menus in my mailbox. I Live in Carnegie. I ordered on line and said 45 min for delivery. Ok. Np. And they deliver beer. $3 for a Stella, cool.  But they were 25 min late with my food and the 5 cheese pizza sucked! Horrible taste. And how can you make mozzarella sticks taste bad? They did. And the dipping sauce was water down pizza sauce.  Never going to order from them again!  And you shouldn't either."}
{"text":"This place is the reason I no longer go to the grocery store.

I love their pizza! It's just greasy (in a good way), cheesy, delicious pizza. And the fact that you can get it by the slice (for $2!) means I eat more pizza than a drunk frat boy.

My fave is the bread twist. If you've ever fantasized about getting a Pizza Hut stuffed crust pizza that was just the stuffed crust -- this is basically it. Couldn't think of any better food!"}
{"text":"When you are headed/leaving the stadium, just pass by this place.

Pizza is mediocre at best.

If you're starving, wasted, etc, grab a slice and get outta there.  I'm sure Pittsburgh has much better pizza than this place.

Location. Location. Location. does not equal good pizza.

They just got there first."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this a 1/2 star because this place has terrible food! This is the first time in about 2 years that I've have ordered from Giovanni's because of the last time I ordered I had about the same experience and this will be the last time! 
I had about a $30 order from mozzarella sticks to chicken wings to two subs and all of it was disgusting my special requests because I have picky eaters seemed to bother the person taking the order. Not to mention I called and asked what was the on the Italian sub and whoever answered the phone said she didn't know but she eats it all the time......????!!!
The mozzarella sticks were freezer burnt and tasted like cardboard, the wings were not prepared the way I asked fried only with the sauce on the side they were fried after the sauce was tossed and then refried to try to cover it up. Pure laziness on the cooks behalf making a mistake and not fixing it properly. Now my son won't eat because he doesn't like buffalo sauce and that's all you can taste. The subs on the other hand were also disgusting we ordered a turkey bacon sub hot, The only thing that was hot was the toasted bread. The turkey had to be the lost grade turkey I have ever tasted,yuck! The bacon which was extra $ was cold and was diced up like they had it for the pizza but it was on a sub!? I thought bacon strips were used on subs??! The wrap I ordered was hot in temperature (not flavor) but not what I was expecting at all I've never had a grilled buffalo chicken wrap (how does buffalo sauce stick to grilled chicken??) it was a mess, also I had asked for the ranch on the side and onions to be left off which it wasn't...they must've put it in a Panini press of some sort my tomatoes my lettuce was hot and mushy. Absolutely disgusting... Didn't even eat it majority went in the trash!I will never ever ever order from them again, the worst food ever.. we actually had to order from another place. $60 dinner.... (because I had to go spend another $30 for another dinner @ Main Street Pizza ) which was delicious!! thanks for hard earned money wasted giovanni's."}
{"text":"We went to Hollywood lanes and ordered pizza. One large chicken and mushroom pizza, one medium buffalo chicken. Food was very terrible! Greasy and soggy. Buffalo chicken was topped with so many toppings that it was more than an inch thick. Stay away."}
{"text":"Not sure what happened but these pizzas seem not to be cooked properly(too many orders to fill?)  Ordered the Hawaiian and it was as though someone mixed the cheese, ham, pineapple and whatever bacon, if any, in a mixing bowl with a fork and slopped it on some dough for an unsatisfying mess.  Undercooked.  Fell apart.  Unedible.  Thirty bucks with tip for a large and a two liter and I ate 1.5 pieces.  My last order from Giovannis."}
{"text":"Just yucky.. The bread tasted too salty and the pizza was floating with oil.. Will never go back to this place."}
{"text":"Purchased a Hawaiian pizza on line in was done in 15 minutes hot and delicious combination of ham  pinapple and a great crust"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of the pizza, but LOVE the bread twist. Highly recommend. Great family-owned business with awesome employees."}
{"text":"Great NY style thin crust pizza in a friendly,  laid back atmosphere.  Everything we've had here has been top notch. The Garlic knots are not to be missed."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service experience. I placed my order over 45 minutes ago and they lost the order. So now I am having to wait another 35 minutes. You would think they would have handled it better because it was their mistake but no apologies or anything. They have also gotten my order wrong in the past, but I didn't realize until I got home. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I ordered online at 6:22. Pizza did not arrive until after 8.  It took way to long to get here. And when it arrived it was extremely cold. I wouldnt of even cared so much but when it came we couldnt eat it. i had to put everything in the oven for even longer. I am really unhappy with that. I used to have much better service, but everything is going downhill.  I was watching my two kids by myself, and we were all looking forward to an awesome night, movies and pizza, and it was ruined. It is really sad.  I dont want to stop ordering from them, but I dont know what else to do.  The kicker is when trying to submit feedback online, the page doesnt work, so you cant even email them. I think that speaks volumes. I then tried to call them to complain, and no one picked up.  I wish someone would reach out to me, because i cant reach out to them!"}
{"text":"The gourmet pizzas are great. Just had the spinach and chicken pizza. It was like a party in my mouth and everyone was invited. 
I ordered delivery, which arrived in a reasonable amount of time. 
The guy on the other end was kind enough to let me know of a special going on with my order and gave me that option as well. 
I like Giovanni's. They're my go-to downtown for pizza."}
{"text":"This place sucks. Although the food was decent, I order a Caesar salad and it was just lettuce and chicken for $11, way over priced for a shitty salad. Also got a $15 calzone and it was undercooked. Wouldn't recommend ordering delivery from this place."}
{"text":"Was in town to see the Steelers, stopped by after the game (and couldn't get service at Jerome Bettis' place SMH) which might not have been that bad of a thing at all. 

I stopped in and ordered a meaty calzone, and was very impressed. It was loaded with pepperoni, salami, sausage, etc and as extremely tasty. If you're going to stay in downtown Pittsburgh, I'd highly recommend it..."}
{"text":"Giovanni's is probably my favorite pizza in Pittsburgh. The crust is just the right amount of chewy and the sauce has a subtle sweetness to it. The garlic dipping sauce is  and so are the pepperoni rolls. Love popping in late-night for a slice after a few drinks in the Cultural District!"}
{"text":"Seemed semi-promising, however our delivery was over an hour and a half late and had to call and ask where our order we place was or if there was an eta. Soon the driver got lost and did not arrive for an additional half hour. The food was soggy and awful when we got it. Will never go here again, terrible food and service."}
{"text":"Between the longer than expected waits for food, simpler than expected \"side-salads\", and overly sweet pizza sauce, I just don't get the attraction to this place.

I've seen people both here and in person rave about this place, but I'm just not buying what their selling.

It's just OK."}
{"text":"I saw a pic of one of Giovannis meat lover pizza's on fb and I went out of my way to get one. It was delicious and so were those garlic wings! I will be addicted for life!"}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this when I ordered online.  I ordered their steak sandwich, and my wife and daughter ordered gyros.  The amount of food for the price is good.  The sandwich was large and was full, as were the gyros.  However what I got (maybe because of expectations) was not a steak sandwich, but more a roast beef.  The gyros were decent, but the tzatziki didn't taste right;  it tasted more like a sour cream than a yogurt, making the sauce heavy instead of bright.  The bread appeared to be homemade and was good.

I still want to try their pizza, as the bread was solid; however I won't be ordering the gyros again."}
{"text":"We ordered lunch today - a few pies and some salad.  Everything was delicious and fresh. The order was accurate and on-time.  I loved the bbq chicken pizza.  The pineapple was a great compliment to all the flavors on the pie!!  The pizza went fast- otherwise I would be sharing some photos.   The salad was fresh and well put together.  The gang dug into it before I could confirm the entire order was there.. and it was..everything was accounted for.  

Thanks Giovanni Pizza and Pasta!"}
{"text":"Great pizza. We only had a bad experience once with them (which I'll go into later). Since I won't base my rating based on past experiences, I'm giving this place four stars.

I've only ever gotten pizza from them. The first thing I noticed every time we got a pie was it came to us fast and it was still hot! Often when you get a delivery, the pizza comes warmish but not piping hot. This is a definite plus.

The cheese and toppings are great. I didn't notice the sauce being too sweet but its just right. The dough is delicious. Its fluffy and chewy at the same time. I always say the secret of a good pizza is in the dough and these guys deliver.

I've never gotten their hoagies or salads but several of my coworkers would order one of their salads pretty much every night. They raved about the chicken and feta salad, a salad they felt needed no dressing. It always looked good but I have a hard time paying $10 or more for a salad. Another coworker always got the Italian sausage hoagie. I never tried it but it always looked good. Nice, crusty bread. Lots of meat and cheese piled high.

This place is a bit more expensive than some of the other choices downtown or on the Northside but (except for this one time), the food has always been great.

This one time? We ordered three large pizzas on a Saturday. When they got here, the pizzas were soaked in water. We called back and they fought with us over it. They said they were so wet because they used canned mushrooms. This is a lie because for starters, they use fresh mushrooms, not canned ones. Secondly, the two pizzas without mushrooms were soaked. Thirdly, I've worked in a pizza kitchen before. Even if the cook was super sloppy and opened up a can of mushrooms and just dumped it out of the can, water and all, it wouldn't have produced the amount of fluid on the pizza.

Honestly, I think they used some cheese that had gotten frozen and had formed ice crystals. And they were trying to get rid of the cheese instead of wasting it. They sent us a free pizza....that was the same way. We vowed never to order from them again. Most of us stuck to our guns.

Today, management ordered us pizza so we didn't have to break our word. The pizzas we got today were fine. Quite tasty, as always (except that one time). They just had a bad day and, unfortunately, chose not to throw away the bad cheese. Oh well, I'm not going to hate on them forever for a couple of bad pizzas."}
{"text":"While traveling through Pittsburgh we ordered in.  The food is good and is a great value.  The amount of food for the money is great also.  We had a large pizza, sausage bread and wings and were very pleased."}
{"text":"Please order the pizza and cheesy bread, PLEASE DO NOT ORDER ANYTHING ELSE. I am a frequent customer of Giovanni's for their good pizza, cheesy bread, and also subs. I chose to eat in and try their Italian food (full menu) twice recently. There were clearly different chefs. The first time was pretty average- seafood pasta. Fresh seafood and homemade sauce. 
I returned tonight to discover that tonight's chef \"the parsley assassin\" has reinterpreted the menu. 
To start our salads had a weird red powder all over it (old bay seasoning?).
The bread and dipping oil was ruined by an extra heavy dose of parsley flakes.
Side of pasta? Covered in parsley....
Side of mixed veggies? Covered in parsley....
My meal was destroyed by the same solid parsley layer too thick to avoid. Her meal, Chicken Frenchese - was completely wrong - this supposed to be a meal of lightly breaded chicken in a white wine sauce, with mixed veggies (per their menu, my experience, and a google search).
What they served was a breaded chicken breast smothered in spinach, olives, red peppers and the much maligned parsley- in an ocean of red colored olive juice (might have been vodka sauce). It was unpleasant at best. We asked the waitress twice if it was the correct dish and she pointed to the menu and explained to me that olives, spinach and peppers are vegetables.........
Dessert was fair, server unable to explain what \"cheese twists\" are, they turned out to be pizza dough filled with cream cheese.

I left two nearly full meals on the table. No need for take-out containers tonight. 

Based on these experiences, I will not return. Please order the pizza, cheesy bread and subs BUT I WARN YOU - if you try anything else you may not return as well......"}
{"text":"While staying at the hotel nearby; I got really hungry and ducked in here for a quick slice of pizza.  I am glad I did, because it was very tasty.  It was so good in fact I went back the next day too.

They sell pizza by the slice, and this is what I had.  Both times I just had a slice of cheese.  It really was just regular pizza, nothing fancy, but very good.  The sauce is a little sweet, and they put a ton of cheese on the pizza which I love.

The interior is definitely no frills, but what do you expect from a pizza place?  The pizza is good and the price is right.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza places in Pittsburgh. It's a great place to stop in for a snack after a day of walking around the city for 4 or 5 hours.

The staff has always been kind. I am a fan of their distinctive sauce. It has a nice sweetness. Slices are a nice size."}
{"text":"I am new to this area so I am looking for the best pizza this side of town ! But your not going to find it here . The sauce was far to sweet the pizza I had left over I put in the bin cos it was rubbish and over priced, I will not be coming back here !!!"}
{"text":"I wish I didn't like their pizza so much - I might not forget how abysmal their service is! Ordered pizza online at 5:39 - website said it would be here at 6:33. Got cold pizza & warm salad at 7:10 -no apology, discount or thank you for ordering! Just \"we're busy\". Well, I guess I'll help out by not ordering from them anymore."}
{"text":"We stopped by Giovanni's Pizza last night, at the recommendation of a family friend. Upon entering, we had to walk past several sets of older looking tables and chairs (that were pushed up next to the wall), in order to get to the ordering counter. Our order was promptly processed. The cashier then proceeded to get us styrofoam glasses of water. However, she was unable to locate the water dispenser on the pop machine. After requesting help from another employee, the cashier was eventually able to get the glasses of water for us. However, the water was slightly pink, since the glasses were not completely emptied out after the several attempts to fill them with water from the dispenser.

After waiting for nearly 30 minutes, our extra large cheese pizzas were ready. A female employee apologized for the delay. The pizzas were piping hot when served.They had thin crusts and a tasty and slightly sweet sauce. It was quite unique and delicious. As we were departing, a female employee thanked us. I will most likely return in the future, but possibly carry out my order the next time."}
{"text":"Horrible!! I just moved to pitt and have been using yelp to find good food. This place had mixed reviews and i did like the pizza once before. Today i ordered a chicken gyro with fries and oreo cheesecake. 
1. The sauce was watery 
2. Old lettuce and onions that were under the fries, not on the gyro???
3. Old half cold fries
4. Website says the homemade cheesecake comes in a complimentary jar....plastic container , warm and def not homemade!
5. The delivery man was rude! He called to be let in the building (apartment). Then just apparently stood in the lobby waiting for me to come down? Do homeowners come to the driveway? Why would i come down? Then after a few minutes (5 tops), he finally came up. He hung up on me 2x. Complaining he waited for 15min! Needless to say there was no tip. 
6. This place is so overpriced as well! 
7. Dont waste your time or money!"}
{"text":"I ordered four pizzas for my daughters birthday party. One was gluten free.  All the pizzas were a big hit.  I would not hesitate to order from Giovanni's Pizza and Pasta again."}
{"text":"A little disappointed. I did some research and it showed that Giovanni's had good rating so I was excited when I went to their website and clicked on 'order online' and it showed my zip code (15205) as a zip that they offer delivery to. I was placing an order over $50 and wanted it delivered. To double-check, I called to make sure they deliver in my area. I called and a young lady answered the phone. She had a polite tone, but when I told her that I live in Robinson Township and wanted to confirm delivery, she said they don't deliver to Robinson. If this is the case, you should remove that zip code from your site because it's misleading."}
{"text":"Amazing your pizza was perfect. Ordered a large pepperoni pizza last night, planning on getting another one tonight."}
{"text":"Great Pizza, Wings, and Salad.  Decent sized order was delivered exactly when requested.  Friendly service and quality food at a fair price, what more needs to be said.  

I am not necessarily an expert on pizza but the pizza was fantastic, a great quality and quantity of ingredients."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery on 4/22/16, and the food was good.  Would have been a higher rating if the delivery guy wasn't so non-caring.  He noticed that the pizza box looked like he sat on it while driving to our location!  He opened the box and saw the cheese all sticking to the top of the box and instead of saying anything, he grab the money and took off without saying a word!!!!  Really guy, I hope you get the same service you provide!"}
{"text":"This is some of the best pizza I've ever had in my life. Unbelievably delicious!"}
{"text":"Giovanni's has great food! 

They're pizza is really really good. I always get pepperoni and mushroom. The sauce is sweet but it's good! They also carry calzones, stromboli's, wedgies, salads, wings, wraps, philly cheesesteaks, hoagies, pastas, white and gourmet pizzas. 

Their cheesesteaks are really good! You can choose from original, mushroom, pepper, mushroom pepper, pizza and cajun, They come with grilled onions and your choice of Cheez Whiz, provolone and American cheese and lettuce and tomato upon request. 

The club wrap is delicious too! It has turkey, ham, bacon, provolone, mozzarella, lettuce, tomato, onions and mayo on a spinach wrap. IT IS EPIC! 

They offer free fast delivery as well! All in all a great place!"}
{"text":"I'll begin this by saying that my expectations were not too high for this place, so the fact that they fell below them was really disappointing. The menu looks pretty great so we ordered for for delivery one. Its a little pricey but I was pretty excited to order a White Pizza which I have not had since moving to the area last year. My excitement made the $16.50 for a large pie a little easier to swallow. What we got was NOT white pizza. Apparently these folks have never been to any other Italian pizzeria or eatery in the country to experience what a white pizza is supposed to be. Barely any riccota on the one we received and the crusted was so burnt that it almost felt like eating a flat bread. I wouldn't mind so much if the price weren't so high but even my dog wasn't interested in it. Positive: the manicoti was very good despite the $9 charge and, for $2.95, the house salads are fantastic. Will probably order pasta again from them but definitely not any speciality pizzas."}
{"text":"Great option for those on a gluten free diet.  Gluten free pizza was good, but I was most impressed when they brought regular garlic bread (for my wife) and gluten free garlic bread (for me)."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza to the hotel.  Service was fast requested well done, but the cheese was really toasty almost all brown. Didn't look appetizing. Tip don't order well done."}
{"text":"Best pizza bar none.  I won't eat pizza from anywhere else if I'm near here.  Their Philly Cheesesteak pizza is out of this world.  Beefy and creamy cheesy.  They also have awesome wings and I love their Chicken Francesa.  It's fettuccine with noodles and a lemony creamy sauce with tender chicken.  You can't go wrong with anything here.  Their service is friendly and they do deliver."}
{"text":"They do not honor their gift certificates.  They will happily sell them to you but if you try to redeem one they WILL NOT HONOR them when you try to use them.  The will actually try to sell you another gift certificate that is worth less for the same price instead of honoring the original one.

I am not sure how the food is since I never got the chance to try it... but if the way they treat potential customers (by tricking them into buying worthless certificates) is indicative of the food I guess I am not missing much.  Thumbs down 100%."}
{"text":"This pizza was extremely hot on delivery, which is always a plus ....... There was absolutely no skimping on the toppings at all .  The crust was a little soft , but not under cooked ..... Might want to ask if you like your crust a little more crispy !!!

My kids loved it"}
{"text":"Very solid pizza...not nearly as sweet as some of the reviews would have you believe, but sweet nonetheless.  They delivered the pie at exactly the time they predicted, and it hit the spot. I would go back in a heartbeat.  Would have been nice had the pizza been hot when delivered, but it was plenty warm enough.  Prices were reasonable too."}
{"text":"If you like a sweeter sauce and dough (a la Fiori's) that delivers, Giovanni's is solid every time. 

I will say one more thing...

Cheesy. Bread. 

Don't think. Just order."}
{"text":"In 2008, I would give 5 stars.  The pie has degraded significantly over the years.  Greasy and nasty.  All around bad.  Sauce still good but pie as a whole is just bad.  Just such a shame because there was a time that this pie was top of line. Crust degraded, cheese degraded, whole pie just degraded.  Every time I get it, part of me thinks I'll get that once 5 star pie but I'm always disappointed.  Relative to what it once was I wish I could give negative stars."}
{"text":"Tasty pizza!! Great owners.  Even delivered to us after close one night.  Very high quality toppings"}
{"text":"Terrible service they have me wait two hours for their mistake and when I call to confirm my food they say they won't deliver it. THERE IPAD RAN OUT OF BATTERY SO ITS MY FAULT THEY DIDNT GET MY ORDER. Guess what guys you get a lot of business from me from the hotel I work at in Oakland guess Pizza Mia is our hotels preferred delivery restaurant. Peace"}
{"text":"The service is very different, depending on the day. I am gluten-free, so if I want to order pizza, Giovanni's is really my only option in Dormont.

There are days when I will order pizza, and it arrives at a reasonable time. Maybe a half hour, sometimes 40 minutes which is pretty slow yet understandable. However, there are other days where it will take over an hour to deliver. I never have a huge order either, just the one pizza. 

However I must admit, the pizza is very good and I cannot complain about the food itself. I love cheese, and there's plenty of cheese on the pizza. I'm very satisfied with that.

The prices can be iffy though. They charge about $11 for a medium gluten free pizza (not including toppings) which I feel they only charge so high for gluten free because they're the only ones who offer it in Dormont. Pepperoni costs over $2, so if I just get an average gluten free pizza with pepperoni, the cost is nearly $15 which is a lot for pizza. 

All in all, okay service, great pizza, prices are a little high."}
{"text":"Blah! It may not be the worst pizza I've ever eaten, but it was far from good.  

I stopped in for a slice on my way to the ball game while visiting from out of town. It looked authentically good from the outside but the slices I received could easily have been passed for reheated lunchtime leftovers. They were soggy, overcooked, and just lukewarm.  Not a lot of flavor to the sauce or the cheese likely because they were close to being stale. I hope their usual provisions are far better than what I experienced.  

Not my first recommendation. Sorry!"}
{"text":"Don't know about their pizza but their person that answers the phone was one of the rudest people I have ever spoken with. Usually when your in the restaurant or service industry your first impression is the most important. Needless to say I thanked her for being so rude, hung up and called another restaurant that delivers."}
{"text":"Took forever to get a slice of over cooked pizza. When it finally was ready, was not appetizing. 

They prioritize the delivery orders, but imagine that those customers are also disappointed"}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza. One of the better pizza places in Pittsburgh. The pepperoni they use is pretty good. It is a nice cup and char.  Sauce is decent too."}
{"text":"Not sure about others, but we go here a few times a month and for Concord this is one of only a few great places to eat out.  Calzones are awesome, marinara is so good you want every last drop, pasta dishes very tasty.  Pizza far exceeds any chain and could be the best in this little town.  Love it!"}
{"text":"Trying to enjoy local restaurants more. We wanted pizza and I remember they sent us out some coupons. We had pizza and wings, both good. Service fast."}
{"text":"I had a cheese pizza slice and garlic bread with cheese.  The pizza was pretty ordinary, very similar to a frozen pizza.  They put plenty of cheese on the pizza.  The crust is also very unremarkable, certainly not great but also not terrible.  The garlic bread was also pretty ordinary.  The pizza sauce is very sweet, lacking Italian flavors.  

The prices are very reasonable.  The cheese slice was $1.85, and the garlic was $2.49.  They have both fountain drinks and canned pop.  They have free refills on the fountain drinks.  The wait staff is very friendly, and the food came out relatively quickly.  The dining area is pretty small.  The tables seat 6 people, but they do not have room for enough people, so don't be surprised if you have to sit with strangers, which happened to me.  However, I had a nice conversation with my table guests.  The location is also really great if you are on the way to a show or a Pirates game."}
{"text":"After dealing with the lady who rolled her eyes at my family I will never be back, some of the people here need to learn some manners"}
{"text":"Pizza is OK, but 1 star for the 1.5 hour delivery time. 

Giovanni's was about 10 minutes away. Ordered two large pizzas for delivery ($45) and was told it would take about 45 minutes. Called after an hour and twenty minutes and told the pizza would be there \"soon.\" No explanation or apology. The guy showed up 15 minutes later with two lukewarm pizzas."}
{"text":"Overall I was unimpressed with this place. I've ordered delivery from here a few times. Delivery times were slow and the food was very greasy. If you're in a pinch, I'd say go for it, but there are other places out there. I definitely wouldn't go here to sit down and eat considering there are far superior sit-down italian places nearby."}
{"text":"Great visit. Clean restaurant with very helpful staff' The chicken philly was a winner. I had the ham and cheese hot sub. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Good pizza- better than the average walkin pizza place.  But you might as well skip the pizza and order a big helping of the cheese bread- its delicious.  Order online for special pricing."}
{"text":"Don't eat here they mess up your food and don't care we thought it was if you ordered my delivery but we went down early when no one was there I'm very unhappy with the way they don't even try to fix it when they mess up l, most be rude cooks they don't please at all front of house was friendly but not helpful in fixing the bad food don't chance it"}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza, not so great reheated (in the oven). They're close so I'd definitely order from them again. Delivery was quick, pizza was hot. Price is about the average. Good sauce &  cheese sticks."}
{"text":"Often a 2-star review suggests that the reviewer is angry about some aspect of the service that has nothing to do with the food (e.g., the delivery took too long, the waitstaff was rude, they didn't like the color of the drapes, etc.), and can summarily be dismissed.

I was perfectly happy with the service--

This review is about the pizza.

In fact, it presents a dissenting view: this pizza is bad, folks.  Perhaps my mistake was ordering an extra large, since the whole pizza-eating experience oozed with the sensation of someone trying to cut corners.  The toppings were straight out of a can, tepidly warmed in the oven.  The crust was mushy and watery, a texture that could not be disguised by any amount or kind of sauce.  The cardboard shell surrounding the pizza was easily the tastiest part (and with good texture to boot).  I feel guilty as heck, but I had to throw the rest of that thing away.

Good pizza for Pittsburgh?  Maybe.  But at my ripe old age, I've been lucky to eat pizza in many cities.  Pittsburgh is not getting trounced only by Meccas like New York and New Jersey, but also cities as diverse as LA, Denver, D.C., Berlin, Baltimore, and even Cincinnati, Ohio.  There are many classic, wonderful things about Pittsburgh that should never change.  Its pizza is not one of them."}
{"text":"Beyond bad! Pizza and cheesy bread arrived within 50 minutes. Not bad on that front, but the pizza needed to be reheated because it was cold and the dough tasted Very undercooked. Both the pizza and cheesy bread were flavorless. Im not sure if they ran out of salt for the dough or have new cooks but how do you mess up a plain cheese pizza?
I think I'll stick to Ephesus in the future!"}
{"text":"Great for quick pizza or pasta.  Giovanni's recently went up on their prices, which puts pasta upwards of $9 a plate.  The pizza, however, is very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza! Sweeter sauce, fantastic taste.  I always order from them!"}
{"text":"If you had asked me several years ago what my favorite pizza was in Pittsburgh, I would have said hands down Giovanni's. I was in there a few days ago with a friend before heading over to a Bucs game. Told my out-of-towner that Giovanni's had great pizza. We just wanted a quick slice and were sorely disappointed. Tasted old and stale. Cheese and sausage were so greasy I had to wipe it off with a napkin. The again it was only $2.50 and I did't care much, but man, I was embarrassed. Maybe you gotta order a whole pie like I've done in the past. They were good. Dad-gum good! The place lacks  decor, the bathrooms are putrid, and the tables were dirty. But then again, some times that is what you are looking for. I am far from a food snob, but when I want some greasy, mediocre, cheap pizza, that what I expect to get. Unfortunately, my pizza this past visit did not meet those expectations. But guess what? I'll be back. Hey, I'm a sucker, and I'll want a slice before a Bucs game again."}
{"text":"Best calzone in pgh. Pizza is good. The owner is Turkish, not Italian but no matter.  they seem to put a LOT of cayenne pepper or other hot spicy stuff into the sauce ... achtung."}
{"text":"While coming back from the Convention center we came up to this place. Everyone was starving so we stopped by. At the time everything seemed good. It was a very greasy but still good. Well thanks to Giovanni's my family NEVER wants to eat pizza again! We were so sick all night. Everyone threw up! I feel sorry for the people who have to clean up this hotel room. One thing that is for sure is I'll never forget Giovanni's Nast greasy pizza. I still have the picture in my head of vomit!!!"}
{"text":"Moving here from Maryland Washington DC area it's hard to find authentic Italian food but this is one place you can definitely get it!"}
{"text":"Listen, people in the Dormont area. Don't even bother going to any of the million pizza places in Dormont other than Giovanni's. You are simply wasting your time and money if you're sitting there eating pizza that isn't Giovanni's.

They have the best deals I've ever heard of involving pizza, and you don't even need a pair of scissors to uncomfortably cut a coupon out, because by ordering online you save all that hassle.

For $19.99 you receive a whole 16 inch pizza, a box of DELICIOUS cheesy bread, and a 16 inch hoagie of your choice. I AM NOT SHITTING YOU. This is real.

And not to mention their pizza is amazing; it has a better taste than any other pizza in Dormont, BELIEVE IT!. 

Their hoagies are insane though, maybe a little too much, which is why I didn't give them 5 stars (I got the texas roadhouse chicken which had chicken, onion rings, provolone cheese and peppers and mushrooms.)

So if you're trying to save yourself from having a brain aneurysm from looking at all the places to try pizza in Dormont, do yourself a favor and order Giovanni's."}
{"text":"Pizza is pretty good. ordered buffalo fries and ranch.. got regular fries covered in old bay and no ranch. which was gross."}
{"text":"I visited Pittsburgh in July of 2016 and was wandering over the bridge. Saw the \"we sell pizza by the slice\" sign on the street and said why not. 

First of all, service. My pizza was boxed up and in my hand before my credit card was finished processing.

Second, taste. DAMN. This might be tied for my favorite pizza of all time (held by Crossroads of Hellertown PA). The sauce was flavorful, the cheese was baked just right, the crust was crispy on the bottom but soft in the center. The pepperoni was thinly sliced and added a crispy/spicy element. Amazing. So well done.

I live in NJ, but it's tempting to make the 285 mile trip to have this again. I ordered from here three times during my stay. My arteries may hate me, but hey. Great pizza."}
{"text":"We ordered Giovanni's while staying at the William Penn and it was very good. They delivered to the door and were friendly. Good pizza!"}
{"text":"I was in Pittsburgh for a conference, and wishing I had been in Philly instead, for a cheese-steak.  I had had a \"Pittsburgh\" cheese-steak, which was not the same. I decided to risk the cheese-steak in this place, which was at least conveniently located. I've had a better cheese-steak, but this one was in the top 10, and definitely scratched the itch.  This is definitely low-brow cuisine, so don't expect the top quality anything, let alone atmosphere, but you can get a basic grade of comfort food that might just make it for a reasonable price.  And if you are in the hotel next door, it can't be beat for convenience."}
{"text":"Great food always deliver on time. An they deliver to my are after 10 p.m. forever a customer"}
{"text":"While staying at a nearby hotel, my daughter and I checked in and were starving! We order the chicken gyro and a pepperoni twist roll! Everything was made to order, hot, fresh and delicious! Delivery time was accurate and the price wasn't bad either! Would recommend!"}
{"text":"This pizza is amazing. Coming from Long Island NY I have have been down in NC for 3 years and this is the best pizza I have had in the concord 
/kannapolis area. The garlic knots are to die for !!!! So happy I found this place."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza I've had in awhile! They have the best sauce, it's so sweet! The only problem is that they charge a lot extra for toppings and ranch."}
{"text":"I ordered from Giovanni's from Yelp mainly because I was in a hurry, it had an $8 minimum + no delivery charge, and they're close to my office. I opted for the Sicilian Hoagie and was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. It tasted fresh, flavorful, and even the smaller size was more than enough food for lunch. As far as hoagies go in Pittsburgh, this is a very decent option. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Had their pizza and it was awesome. Wife had the wedge and also very good. I don't recommend eating their as it isn't very clean or comfortable. However, if you are going to carry out you will be pleased."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery today and was told about 30 minutes for delivery and it took and 45 mins. Great gyros and wings. Fries however were ice cold and soggy."}
{"text":"This is my third time ordering from here. The first two times everything was fine. But this time bleh. My fries were wet and they forgot my bbq sauce. The tenders were still good though. I would still order from them."}
{"text":"Great experience, greatest by waitress and had a home welcome feeling when an owner yelled from the kitchen to ask how we were doing today. Had some amazing fried ravioli and couldn't stop at just one piece of pizza by the slice! Strongly recommend checking this place out yelpers!"}
{"text":"OMG. i tried to come back to this place even after the bad rap they got on tv. and this is what i got today with my order. OFFICIALLY DONE WITH GIOVANNI'S. and i want my money back!!!!!!! this is disgusting i'm literally sick and throwing away all the food i ordered. waste of money."}
{"text":"Lots of food for a reasonable price (hurray leftovers!), my favorite delivery pizza that I can get on the North Shore."}
{"text":"I am gluten free, I just discovered this place after living in Mt. Lebo for 6 months. 

They have a great gluten free menu, unlike other restuarants who say they are \"gluten free\" they actually have things besides, salads, steaks and veggies. 

They offer pizza and pasta! I did not give this a 5 for the fact that the restuarant itself could use a make-over. 
To me it is considered a hole-in the-wall type place which most people fo not prefer. 

I brought co-workers here on 2 seperate occasions and they enjoyed it, but again some people may not want to try it out due to the fact that it looks like nothing from the outside. 

Big portions, tastey good and GLUTEN FREE options that far exceed most chain restuarants (which I despise)."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza. We order from here every so often, as they are located downtown where my boyfriend works and it's an easy week night meal and it's CHEAP. A large pizza with garlic butter and a side of banana peppers for like under $13. Can't beat it. And the pizza is divine. So packed with flavor. Tasty crust. Delicious sauce. We really love this place!"}
{"text":"Recently moved to Pittsburgh and the lack of good pizza makes me want to dig in the junk drawer for those old Papa John coupons. THANK THE LORD ABOVE for this place!! The pepperoni and sausage pizza is consistently good!  The other items on the menu needs to be improved a little (wings=above average, bread sticks and garlic knots=average). Not a waste of money eating here."}
{"text":"Always my go-to when I'm craving pizza.  My favorite is the combo with a large cheese pizza, cheesy bread twist, and a drink for only $15!  Definitely the best bang for your buck.  This is the only place that has the cheesy bread twist - it's so simple yet so delish.  The food is always piping hot when it arrives.. i definitely recommend trying this place."}
{"text":"A friend and I were looking for a new pizza joint to try on Sunday night so we decided to give Giovanni's a shot. Unfortunately the food was not good in the least bit. We ordered a large pizza and a dozen wings (they have a special, that combo is $18). Half way through our first slice of pizza my friend and I both looked at each other and asked \"what do you think?\" We both said \"not bad, but certainly not good.\" The pizza is your standard cheap cheese, meh, overly sweet sauce, and un-remarkable crust. We each had two pieces and haven't been able to bring ourselves to touch the left overs. The wings, much like the pizza, weren't bad but they weren't good. They were on the smaller side and the sauce (hot) lacked any sort of flavor. 

We opted to pick up the pizza rather than have it delivered. The interior of this restaurant is filthy. Everything that you touch is sticky and greasy, the floor is caked in dirt, and there were old food scraps (mushrooms, some cheese, a pizza crust, napkins) all over the floor by the cooler and cash register. The restaurant also had a funk to it. 

Giovanni's was worth a shot if only to find out that I should never order from here again."}
{"text":"Food: 3.5
Decor: 1.5
Ambiance: 2
Service: 3
Value: 3

Good for an afternoon pick-me-up slice of pizza. Perfectly satisfactory."}
{"text":"You really know you have chosen a good restaurant when you stand there for 15 minutes and are walked past and totally ignored then are finally greeted by the waitress (as she is wiping off the white board) with  \"Somebody will help you...sometime\" 
Ummm... excuse me?? 
And to think the resturant was recommended."}
{"text":"Getting delivery to the Southside was an easy experience. Their online ordering is easy and even on Super Bowl Sunday they came in exactly the amount of time they said! The price is reasonable with free delivery. Although the food was just warm, nothing 'hot out of the oven'.

We had the pepperoni pizza and breadsticks. The pizza has a sweet sauce, so many people here enjoyed it. Just know that's what you are in for! The breadsticks was actually a slice of french bread with cheese on it - not bad, but nothing I'd get again.

We will probably order again if we are looking for delivery - but based on today's experience I may not seek them out when I'm looking for pizza downtown."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery, it was never delivered haha. This place is a joke. You have plenty of better options available."}
{"text":"Delivery was FAST during dinner-hours on a weeknight. I got one of their online ordering specials - a large pizza, one topping, cheesy bread, and a 2-liter.

The first thing I noticed - the pepperoni was \"miniature\", as in, the diameter was maybe half of what I'm used to on a pizza. Is this a Pittsburgh thing? Maybe it is - I'm a recent Orlando transplant. Size didn't matter, in this case. The pizza was tasty, though I think it could have used a bit more sauce and cheese. -1 star for that, but it's probably largely personal preference.

The cheesy bread is as tasty as it is messy. It's REALLY cheesy.

Overall I'd definitely order from them again."}
{"text":"A friend and myself, him being from California and I from Texas went here looking for a good pizza and let me tell you this was far from good. He ordered two slices of Pizza and they were burnt, I ordered a Stromboli and ask for extra marinara sauce and charged me for it and it was ice cold. Why would you put ice cold marinara on a so called warm Stromboli. I would not recommend this place to anyone. I own a restaurant and if I every did anything like that I would be out of business."}
{"text":"Hands down best delivery in PGH. The pizza was really tasty and the penne with vodka sauce was perfect! The noodles were perfectly cooked and everything arrived piping hot!! And delivery was prompt! Most food available by delivery here is inedible so this was a happy surprise! 

I will definitely order from here again.

Recommended: spinach feta pizza"}
{"text":"Giovanni's has absolutely the best pizza I have ever tasted, period. The calzone was also ridiculously good, filled with beautifully cooked and seasoned sausage. 
We ordered on-line, asked for 9:00 PM delivery. It came at 8:59 PM and the delivery guy brought it to the 5th floor. 
I'm not even going to try another place"}
{"text":"This place has earned a spot on my work's short list for places to order from during our lunch breaks.  I'm usually a bit skeptical when it comes to pizza places in the city because a majority of them are very similar with what they offer.  Most every pizza place offer the traditional and nontraditional pizza, hoagies, wings, calzones, Stromboli, salads, etc.  So that is what I thought when we first ordered from here, it's going to be more of the same.  I was a little wrong with this assumption, which my coworkers won't let me forget.

I was the one that was hesitant while looking over the menu, making my coworkers get a little agitated with me.  But you don't want to order something that you end up not eating.  After much consideration I went with what they call Bread Twists.  I was thinking that this was going to be what other places call house rolls.  Wrong.  What you get looks more like a calzone with less breading.  Shaped like a C instead of it being twisted.  The right amount of filling is laid out appropriately for this mini fest.  Comes with a side of marinara for dipping.  It was kind of like a Hot Pocket, but without that cardboard taste.

Fast and free delivery.  Order online."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to the cultural district last night for a date night. We stayed at the Renassiance Hotel and saw the Christmas Carol at the Byham Theater. We had a great dinner and saw a fantastic show.  On the way back to the hotel we needed a late night snack before bed.  We came upon Giovanni's. It looked like a standard dumpy pizza shop.  We grabbed two slices of pepperoni. The pizza was amazing. The sweet sauce is probably the best part of the pizza. For those of you who bash this place for their sauce, you have no right even commenting on pizza. You have no idea what your talking about. If you want some bland chunky sauce, stick to Pizza Hut. The pepperonis were the little crispy ones that I love. This place might be a bit dirty but the pizza speaks for itself. The slices were $3.00 a piece, but were huge. Worth every penny for downtown prices. Give this place a shot after a Bucco game or show, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"It's the most unfortunate of days when something you love betrays you. I absolutely loved their pizza. Sauce was sweet and delicious. I always recommend them to people looking for a pizza. But today was dooms day. After a long day at work I didn't wanna do anything expect watch the walking dead and cuddle and binge on some pizza and wings. We waited close to an hour for the food to arrive which I didn't mind cause like I said, I loved them. Walking up the steps to my apt a roach crawls up and out of the pizza box. I swear on everything holy. So I call them and tell them and to my surprise they don't even argue it they tell me to come get my money back. So already fuming I drive downtown from south side and get stuck in traffic in the 10st tunnel. When I get there we simply received an \"I'm sorry\" and a refund. What? Is that really all you had to say? A roach crawled out of my pizza box! Needless to say I'm never eating there again. Traumatized. I took my refund and went to Luke Wholeys and that kicked butt! My review for that soon to come haha."}
{"text":"Very clearly labeled order with allergies in two spots on the item ordered itself (requested allergen to not be included on the salad itself, and on the overall order commentary). First salad, I was splitting with a teammate, -and she discovered the allergen before I took a bite.  I called the restaurant and they were receptive and remade my salad right away. Second salad (I was starving) I checked a bit and didn't see any allergen. Then after a bite made my mouth swell, the allergen was hiding on the side of the container.  One epipen later, I called the restaurant back and had to ask for my money back.  Then I was told as an afterthought... oh the salads are pre-made, \"they should've made a new one.\" Really?! Obviously this is one place in pittsburgh where the people working there are totally unfamiliar with a real food allergy.  Ridiculous."}
{"text":"After striking out everywhere else on late night eats, Giovanni's was a hit.  Looks like most people come in for a slice or two...I see why:  they were in and out in a couple of minutes.  A whole pie took nearly a half hour of waiting.  But it was worth the wait...a tasty sweet sauce, chewy crust with garlic dipping sauce, and tiny pepperonis with a nice \"snap\" to them.  Nothing fancy here, this is your stereotypical pizza joint."}
{"text":"Really good best pizza in the area, it's the hout of Pittsburgh. Ima little litty kitty but seriously this is some good pizza!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place a couple times and have ordered from them multiple times. We tried many different things on their menu and one word is enough to describe all: Greasy. I cannot believe the amount of fat they put in their food. It makes it so heavy and drowns the other flavors. Their pasta dishes are simply noodles swimming in oil and sauce. As to their pizza, I would say you can find better pizza around Dormont. Although we do not like their food, I would say that the service is fast and the food is really warm. If you have not tried it, please do so and see it for yourself. Just remember that it is going to be very fatty..."}
{"text":"I hate salads.  But I'm getting fat, so I've been trying to incorporate them into my meat-and-potatoes (french fries) based diet.  Since I own no vegetables, I've been ordering out for my salads, growing weary of the stereotypical pizza place's pile of browned lettuce topped with a few limp, tired pieces of meat.

That being said, the chicken salad I just ordered from Giovanni's is the best salad I've ever had.

For the first time, I had to dig under a monstrous pile of chicken and cheese to find the lettuce, instead of the other way around.  I didn't even have to use the dressing (which I usually pile on to cover the taste of vegetable).  It's kind of pricey ($10) but it's a huge salad, and half of it filled me up.

It may have negated the whole health factor I was shooting for.  But it was well worth it, for having a genuinely pleasant salad experience.  Thank you Giovanni's, you have just become my go-to salad take out."}
{"text":"Giovanni's is one of my favorite pizza places in Pittsburgh. Their pizza crust is the perfect combination of crispy and floppy, the right amount of cheese (not overdone like some pizza places) and their pizza sauce is the best part, it has just a little bit of sweet to it. 
And a nice touch is the service is always friendly when you call to order. 
Give Giovanni's a try...you just might be hooked. ;)"}
{"text":"Food is really good, but delivery is horrible.   Finally found a great pizza in the area.  Thin crust and greasy...just the way it should be.  HOWEVER, If you eat here, definitely pick it up or just eat there.  On average we wait an hour to an hour and a half.  We are less than 2 miles from there.  Pizza will still be hot but anything else ordered is cold.  So if you have time to spare and aren't starving"}
{"text":"This was my second delivery experience with Giovanni's. First was cold, some raw, some burned, pizza for a group that was  redelivered in about the same condition. Lunch yesterday was ordered with a group. Most went un- eaten or was said to be just OK. Lots of comments wondering why something was ordered when it wasn't good last time. My hot sausage hoagie was cold. The shredded cheese was still in individual pieces as if just out of the package. The roll was toasted on top and soaked with something cold on the bottom to the point that it couldn't be held and fell apart if touched. I peeled most of it away and put what I had remaining from my $11.49 sandwich in our microwave so that it was edible. I'm done with Giovanni's. There are too many other places that want my business."}
{"text":"I don't see the allure of this place.  Don't like the taste, at all.  It's a walk-in pizzeria that . . . I don't know.  I got nothin'.  I'd rather have a Digiorno's."}
{"text":"So, I'm giving this place 2 stars only because their pizza is sort of decent.

The first time I had the pizza, it was purchased by some of our vendors at my job.  They ordered a few different kinds - buffalo chicken, the ranchero, plain, and pepperoni.  I had a slice of the buff chick and a slice of the ranchero.  They were good, pretty tasty, and different from the usual.  I thought to myself, \"Cool! A new place to have lunch every now & then!\" So when a co-worker asked me if I wanted to order from Giovanni's for lunch, I jumped all over it. This time, however, I decided to go with the chicken tender salad.  Talk about a huge let down....

As soon as I was handed the salad, which was thrown together in a see-through container, I could tell it was going to be sub-par.  Ready for the lineup of thrilling ingredients?  It was 4 chicken tenders (probably once frozen) thrown on top a bed of iceberg lettuce, a few shredded carrots, about a half pound of shredded mozzarella cheese, 3 cucumber slices (1 of which was about as thick as a deck of cards while the other 2 were thin enough to see through), and, drum roll please, croutons which had absolutely no flavor.  These tasted \"homemade;\" and by homemade, I mean they were made from bread that was left out over night, and then torn up into chunks.  I can't quite find the words to describe this salad...it was just....gross.

I complained to a friend about how disappointing my salad was, and her response - \"Well, why would you order a salad from a pizza joint?\"  Well \"friend,\" how about don't put food on your menu that tastes like garbage (and then have the nerve to charge $11 for it). If you're going to have a food business, be proud of what you do and what you're making.

Anyhow, the pizza was decent...or maybe it just tasted better b/c it was free? I don't know...but what I do know is, I won't be ordering from here again.  I typically like to support local biz, but when you're serving me something I once ate at a grade school lunch (which was actually probably better than the salad I got here), don't expect to keep the customers coming back for more."}
{"text":"Walking across town after a baseball game and in need of a bite to eat, we stumbled upon Giovanni's Pizza.  After a quick glance on Yelp to make sure this place was somewhat safe to try, we entered and queued up.  Options for a slice were limited to cheese or cheese & pepperoni.  I opted for the latter and within a few minutes was munching down on a delicious slice.  The crust was a traditional hand tossed, and the sauce was sweet.  I really enjoyed the sauce, but the edge of the crust was a little chewier than I prefer.  A little extra toasting of the crust would have appealed to me more, but it was delicious nonetheless.  Be sure to load up on the parmesan cheese, garlic power and Italian seasoning available at the register."}
{"text":"it was my first time ordering, as it was one of few open places  that opened 12:30 two day before christmas. It appears, from previous reviews, this place is hit or miss for delivery, but I was very impressed . Ordered a college special #2, the items arrived promptly (probably bc i was the only one ordering?), warm. Pizza, cheese rolls were tasty and a huge drink. Got me through writing a manuscript...will try again until they strike out."}
{"text":"First time in Pittsburgh and was starving after a concert I went to. Ordered some pizza late night. Was really good, and very reasonably priced. New York style...and the cheese on top was slightly/perfectly burnt (in a good way). I liked the sauce, my girlfriend wasn't crazy about it. Delivery was super fast and the dude was blasting some EDM. For a late night pizza fix....You could do waaayyy worse."}
{"text":"Giovanni's messed up my (delivery) order, and I couldn't resolve the issue over the phone. I had to go in, and the manager was rude, argumentative, and completely unhelpful. She blamed others for the mistake instead of just apologizing. She treated me like I was an inconvenience and she was too busy to deal with the problem. While I got a refund, there was no attempt to fix the problem, and I had to order from somewhere else. There was no excuse for the horrible customer service, and I won't be back."}
{"text":"This review is only for their Canoli: I tried a couple of their canolis. They said that they are homemade but they were already put together and kept in the fridge so the shell was somewhat soft. I wasn't a fan of the cream either."}
{"text":"Ive eaten at Giovannis Pizza so many times but I've never written a review. I guess its about time right?

Giovannis Pizza is delicious. You don't really have to dress up your pizza in toppings to be absolutely blown away by what they produce. A simple cheese pizza is full of flavor on its own. The tomato sauce that they use speaks for it self. Some may say its a bit too sweet but to each his own. 

I've never had a disappointing slice here and if they continue to do what they're doing I never will."}
{"text":"Over priced pizza loaded with an excess of everything and a super sugary sauce.... It's a last resort pizza stop for me. Definitely edible, but comparable to Little Caesars."}
{"text":"This has quickly become one of my favorite pizza spots in the city. I've never eaten there, but lucky for me, this is on my boyfriend's way home from work so he can bring some delicious take-out home! 

We've had a few different kinds and it has always been delicious. Crispy crust and perfectly cooked dough. My favorite was a combo of spinach, grilled chicken, roasted red peppers, mozzarella and feta cheese. 

Not sure of their delivery radius within the city, but definitely check them out!"}
{"text":"The delivery time was fast and friendly. The food left something to be desired. The Famous Buffalo Bread Twists were plain chicken and cheese. Honest mistake. Then I opened my steak hoagie. BE WARNED, SPOILER ALERT!!!!
The steak is actually ROAST BEEF. I know, TECHNICALLY roast beef is a cut of steak, but you're the ONLY people that serve roast beef as steak. If I wanted a roast beef sandwich I would have gone to Arby's.

Horrible service, and all they did was argue about the fact of it being steak. They did not even offer to make a different hoagie for me. 

Giovanni's who? Exactly."}
{"text":"Went to Giovanni's after being in town for a Pirates game. It was my first night in Pittsburgh, and this place turned out to be a very pleasant surprise. A Pittsburgh local overheard me and my high school buddy talking about finding a pizza place, and recommended it to us. We each just got a couple of slices of plain pizza but once we started eating we were in awe of how good the pizza was. Unfortunately I cant speak to any other of their food, but the plain pizza was absolutely awesome. The sauce is a little sweet. This place definitely cares about the product they make. Although the building and actual restaurant is nothing special, the food is."}
{"text":"Seriously my favorite pizza in downtown! It must be that sugar in their sauce that makes it so sweet and delicious with every single bite! We come here often for 2 slices of pepperoni that only sets us back $5 for 2 large slices! 

They also have a giant menu with many different options (typical pizza shop; hoagies, salads, wraps, fried appetizers, ect)

One day I was feeling sick & we went somewhere different  for a cup soup for me and a slice of pizza for the other half. we were so disappointed in that pizza compared to Giovanni's! (we are sorry for abandoning you! Never again!!). 

I actually had the pleasure of deciding where to order pizza at my job for a conference meeting. After lunch, 4 different coworkers came up & said \"where was that pizza from?!?!?\" It's now officially our pizza delivery spot for conference meetings! Yay Giovanni's! :)"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience in the 2 years i've been going here. The online deal-large cheese pizza, wings, and cheesy bread is DEFINITELY the best deal in town. I dont even waste my time with Vocelli (right across the street), or driving to Fiori's (my second favorite)...this is seriously the best take out in town. Even their gyros are delicious! Try it for yourself!"}
{"text":"the best Pizza in The Entire United States!!
 i've had pizza in NY, i've had pizza in Chicago, i even had pizza in Tokyo, but the pizza here in pittsburgh @ ilovegiovannis is the absolute best pizza i have had in my life!! i have been here 3 times, ordered the pittsburgh steel city pizza(no coleslaw) and it has always been a great experience."}
{"text":"Pizza - 5 stars - very tasty crust and toppings
Buffalo fries - 2 stars - too spicy and no sauce
Onion rings - 1 star - thick and soggy
Turkey hoagie - 4 stars - nicely toasted bread and tasty cheese, lettuce, tomato, and mayo
Sweet twist - 2 stars - unsweetened bread with sweet filling and toppings
Delivery - 3 stars - timely but did not want to come to our door

Summary: Order their pizza and hoagies. The wings during my previous visit were also decent."}
{"text":"Gave it another chance, gross!  The pizza was almost inedible although menu says voted 3 best.  And the delivery driver was dirty, grungy and looked like he was strung out.  This seems completely different than downtown location unless they were sold?"}
{"text":"The Pros:
They deliver to the North Shore (Allegheny Center Mall)
They have a large selection of menu items
Great lunch specials
Online ordering

The Cons:
Inconsistency in service and delivery
Minimum order for delivery is higher then the price of the lunch specials
Inconsistency in item size/quality at times

I first tried Giovanni's because my husband raved about it and wanted to go there before we hit an event downtown.  I am not the biggest pizza fan out there but I agreed to try.  We got a half sausage/half cheese and pepperoni pizza.  I enjoyed the taste of the sauce and it had a nice amount of meat on the pie.    In subsequent visits, I've tried the pasta, a hoagie and various salads.  None of the items would be rated as the best I've ever had somewhere, but they were all enjoyable. I have found that their pizzas taste best when consumed pretty quickly.  

If you eat there, it is important to know there are very few tables and it can get chilly from the front door opening and closing. 

Overall an enjoyable experience and a go to place for me when ordering lunch to be delivered to Allegheny Center Mall."}
{"text":"I came here on a Tuesday afternoon for lunch with a friend of mine. Their restaurant and restrooms are very clean. Their staff is friendly. I ordered a slice of pizza and mozzarella sticks. My friend ordered the eggplant parmigiana. She always says how wonderful the it is. She also replaced the garlic bread for buttered bread since she is not a fan of garlic. The mozzarella sticks were hot so the cheese pulled apart easily. The pizza was great and it was on special for $1 a slice that day and I didn't realize it. This is my second time here and I will come back because of their food and service."}
{"text":"Giovanni's Pizza had a really great three cheese pizza as well as their puttsburgher pizza. However with all of the pizza places downtown and throughout the city, I found them to be too overpriced. Also whenever I went to use he restroom, their soap dispenser was broken and instead used a styrofoam cup that had the words soap on it. That's a little bit unsanitary"}
{"text":"I checked into my hotel at a bit past midnight and I was looking for  a place to grab a quick bite before heading out.  Picked up a nice tasty slice of pepperoni pizza for $2.50 and I was on my way.  I'm sure I'll be back before I leave town."}
{"text":"My feelings about Giovanni's is mixed. I worked there in high school, and can tell you that it is a dirty place. Perhaps it's changed in the last few years, but when I was there it had a big bug problem. 
However, their pizza is one of my favorites. It's got a sweeter sauce than most pizza places, which works in its favor. I love the garlic sauce they give with each pizza. Each time I'm in Pittsburgh I have at least one drunk giovannis extravaganza. I just hope they try to clean the place up a little."}
{"text":"They only deliver within a 5 mile radius. 
We are 5.1 miles away and were about to order almost $100.00 worth of food.
I've heard of going the extra mile for someone but these people won't even go 1/10 of a mile!"}
{"text":"We had a catered pizza lunch at work today courtesy of the Downtown Giovanni's, and everything was off the hook! Their wings are also seriously the best I've ever had. I'm gonna get Darren to order from the one in Dormont since it's the closest one to us. 

They also have onion petals! Yummo!"}
{"text":"I've had their pizza in the past, and it's always been good, but this one has a \"chocolate factory\" next door (like what Mineo's in Squirrel Hill does) that makes really good candy."}
{"text":"Came in here at random looking for a quick meal before catching our bus and I'm sure glad I did. My chicken and bacon hogie was fantastic and my friend said his pizza was excellent as well. About the only complaint is that the menu didn't say if you could by pizza by the slice. This is truly a hidden gem in downtown Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"The pizza is good but the place is so unkempt and dirty. I won't be back due to the conditions. A few days after we got food from there there was a depth of health issue brought up on the news."}
{"text":"After finding ourselves in the Pittsburg Amtrak station with a 2 hour layover we decided to order delivery. We had an amazing meat lovers hoagie. It was enough food for a family of 4!  The sandwich was fresh and hot delivered in about 25 minutes."}
{"text":"This is the old standby for my work. Any time we order pizza it's from here. I'm not a fan personally. Too greasy (I understand pizza is meant to be greesy, but really??) and the sauce seems like it adds sugar and is just plain too sweet for my tastes. 

I like my pizza plain. Cheese, that's it; however work orders this \"Pittsburgh pizza\" which is quite interesting. Very primanti's like, so if you are in the mood for an adventure you should try it."}
{"text":"If I could give this zero stars, I would. I ordered the steak sandwich, it took about 15 minutes to get this garbage. I don't understand how people in Pittsburgh think rock hard bread tastes good on a sandwich? Cook the contents then put soft bread on the sandwich.. I don't want to have to schedule a dentist appointment after I eat one of these sandwiches. It's ridiculous. The pizza here must be good because if I was to base it off of sandwiches alone, this place should be closed. Not only are they ripping people off by charging 13 dollars for a garbage sub with bread hard enough to chip your tooth, the service is awful. I was the only person in the place. It was my first time eating here and it's guaranteed my last. I could have went somewhere else and gotten the exact same sandwich for half the price, with better bread and service. Please stop making sandwiches. I don't know why I asked for a box, when I threw it in the nearest garbage can. That is all."}
{"text":"This is a tough review because we really enjoy the pizza. But.... delivery times...not so great.

The pizza itself is great. Sauce is sweeter - which we like. They have an online ordering system that is easy to navigate and if you're part of the rewards program, can be a nice incentive.

Tonight, we ordered two medium cheese pizzas and 6 wings. Placed our order online at 515 pm with an estimated delivery of 559 pm. Knowing it's a Friday night, we didn't really mind that at 615, the order hadn't arrived yet. 

At 630 pm, it finally came - incomplete. Only one medium pizza and the wings. The other pizza, missing.  Driver was apologetic and from the sound of it, was going to come right back with the second pizza. (We live close enough that we should have just gone to get it at this point!) 

It's now 810 pm and after two phone calls, the second pizza finally arrived.  I did not expect anything free. In fact, we used a reward I had earned from spending over $100 on their food via their reward program.  But in both phone calls, not on apology, not one explanation as to what was going to happen or whether or not we'd actually be receiving the second pizza.  

Even though it came, it wasn't as good as the first one. Very disappointed in the customer service and while I have had other positive experiences(hence, the loyalty program), I am not sure I will be ordering it again. Almost 3 hours to get a complete order just isn't right."}
{"text":"I ate here this past Thursday before a show with a dining companion.  Upon walking into the restaurant there is not too much to notice except for the area where they cook and some old booths against a wall.  A closer inspection of the wall will show some nice Pittsburgh sports memorabilia though.

For our pizza my dining companion and I decided upon the plain extra large cheese pizza.  The extra large pizza is a 18\" pizza which may seem a bit much for two people but we easily gobbled it all up since it tasted so good.  What makes the Giovanni's pizza incredibly good is the sauce.  It could be described as slightly sweet but is really something that should be tasted instead of described.  The cheese is also satisfactory and the crust is thin but good.  I have been to Giovanni's many times before and it has never disappointed.  The only thing that is frustrating is having to sit and stare at it while the cheese cools down as it will otherwise not stay on the piece.

The bottom line for me is that the pizza is fantastic and even though it is not much to look at, I will be back here again many times in the future as I would consider this the best pizza in the city."}
{"text":"I stopped by here last Sunday in order to pickup a pizza for my best friend and I to eat while watching football games.  I called out to Giovannis at around 11:50 and ordered an XL pepperoni pizza.  The guy on the other end of the phone confirmed I was picking it up in Dormont and then told me that it would be ready in around 20 minutes.  I arrived just over a half an hour later and my pizza was ready.  I didn't get to see too much of the inside but I noticed a dining room on the right whenever I entered and then the usual kitchen, soda cooler and pick up area on the left.

This pizza like all pizzas can be broken down into its three major components: cheese, crust and sauce.  My favorite part of this pizza was the sauce which had a little sweetness to it.  It's not nearly as sweet as the Giovannis on 6th street and that's ok as I think this sauce has it perfect.  There was a good amount of cheese on the pizza and it was decent enough although nothing special.  Last but not least was the crust which was a bit on the thicker side which I wasn't a huge fan of.  Since I also had pepperoni on this pizza I should probably talk about that as well.  The pepperoni it was sliced from was rather small and the edges of each one had curled up during cooking.  It tasted alright although I wish it had tasted better.

The bottom line for me is that I may stop by here again in the future.  While it wasn't the best pizza that I have ever had, it certainly is satisfactory and I did enjoy the sauce."}
{"text":"I tried to order some food to be delivered and they would not deliver to my neighborhood. This location is downtown and  I live in Morningside which is about 15 minutes from downtown. When I asked if he delivered to Morningside he said he didn't know where that was. I told him it was close to Highland Park and he said he never heard of it and just hung up! Rude! I will never eat there now!"}
{"text":"Good greasy slices and it is cheap. But they wanted $4-5 for fries which was odd.

If you want a cheap bite - slide in. Literally."}
{"text":"99% of the time I ordered take out. Truly authentic NY style pizza. Very good (tho their mushrooms are canned yuck, every other topping is great!) Try their meatball subs or try the meatballs on the pizza! Service is quick and professional. The food is enjoyable. Great deserts too, cheesecake and cannoli!"}
{"text":"This is the absolute worse place ive ever been to. The servers are so slow and seem in highschool the woman who claims herself as the boss \"jean Marie \" was so disrespectful saying the f word around children yelling at employees when I could hear whatever happened wasnt their fault. Over 40.families ive talked to who.will.never return BECAUSE OF HER."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a slice of pizza - the sign in the window indicates you can get pizza by the slice.

Another restaurant in Pittsburgh that does not understand the concept of Air Conditioning. It was so hot and humid in here I was glad that all I ordered was one slice. The faster I could inhale it - the faster I was out of there.

I asked what the options were for slices - I was told \"cheese or  pepperoni.\" So I ordered one slice of pepperoni and got a bottle of cold water to go with it.

The pizza was okay - could have been more pepperoni for my blood, and the pepperoni was the very small diameter stuff."}
{"text":"I have visited this restaurant a few times before for take-out and dine in. All of the previous times I have been greeted by and taken care of by the owner and his very sweet wife. This time was NOT the case and all my previous positive experiences were completely wiped out by one horrendous waitress.
We started our VALENTINES DAY late lunch in a nearly empty restaurant and ordered the Antipasto Salad which was very good.  As soon as the salad arrived we were hounded by a curly haired waitress to order dinner. We told her we were going to eat the antipasto and we'd call her if we wanted to order anything else. 
She returned 4 more times in the next 10 minutes while we were trying to eat and have a conversation to ask again and again if we were going to order anything else. She then walked 6 or 7 feet away to the register and proceeded to tell the other server \"I'm going to leave this screen open cause I don't know if THOSE PEOPLE are ever gonna order anything else.\" I MEAN SERIOUSLY!! There were only 2 other tables with customers in the entire place. Did she think we were deaf and couldn't hear her snide comments! Then she went into the kitchen. Once we finished our salad we did call over another server and placed our entrée order. The first waitress came out and asked the other one, \"Soooo, did they finally order something?\" AGAIN, like we couldn't hear her!  We were only there 55 minutes total and it was awful! I have never felt so rushed and like so much of an inconvenience in my life at somewhere I am PAYING to eat at.
The only time the waitress was remotely pleasant was when she was bringing the check. My husband commented that she must only be happy because we were leaving or she wanted a decent tip. My tip to her would be to get out of the service industry. 
I would strongly caution the sweet couple who own the place to get rid of this server before she destroys your business. I KNOW we will not be returning for fear of another horrendous dining experience."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza! But only when it was fresh. As a self proclaimed cold pizza expert, I feel there is not enough sauce for these cuts to satisfy a pizza craving the next day. The specials they offered on their website were excellent and I will consider them highly again the next time I need pizza in that area, and their gluten free pies are intriguing enough that I must test one soon."}
{"text":"Is hands down the best pizza you can get in downtown Pittsburgh, I order every week! They also have amazing different types of pasta \"stuffed shells\" are my fav"}
{"text":"Best meal in the city so far ! Their pizza is phenomenal. It was easy to savor every slice. The Delivery option is prompt too."}
{"text":"Their spinach feta pizza really IS amazing! Their buffalo chicken pizza is also delicious. Very friendly service. A great option for takeout in the Dormont area!"}
{"text":"Ordered a large cheese and large pepperoni pizza for $30, including delivery and tip.  Absolutely great pizza and delivered to Carnegie in the time they said. I've had their pizza twice so far and love it, the sauce has a delicious sweetness to it I can't place. Definitely highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is one great place to eat. All I can say is I wish I had found it earlier before I moved away. Awesome steak and cheese sub! Big, lots of meat and mushrooms and cheese. Delicious! Plus the fried ravioli is awesome! Can't go wrong eating here!"}
{"text":"I've never had a slice from this place with any less than six drinks in me, so please take this review with a grain of salt. The most confusing yet delightful thing about getting pizza from Giovanni's is the dark cheese that looks burnt. It absolutely tastes better than it looks. Still, know that this is pizza for drunks. If it's not piping hot, it's total rubbish. And if it is piping hot and you're here at 1am, you'll likely burn the roof of your mouth.

Everytime I eat here, it seems to be under renovations with empty pizza boxes stacked up everywhere. It is a bit of a hole, and I'd probably never choose to eat here stone sober, but their pepperoni slices with overcooked cheese and inadvertently \"crunchy\" pepperoni seemingly hit the spot every time.
 
Food/Décor/Service: 3.9/1.6/NA"}
{"text":"I overlooked the bad service reviews on Giovanni's hoping I would at least get great food if I did pickup. I called in my order expecting it to be ready in 30 mins as I was told. My wings were sitting when I arrived. However Giovanni's had difficulty making a medium pizza to fulfill the order.  I requested a refund for my order after numerous inquiries and 40 minutes waiting. The counter and line cooks were in disarray and visibly arguing.  The manager asked if I would like to pay for the wings. I responded I wouldn't  feel comfortable paying for wings that have been sitting on the sink counter for over 40 minutes. The service was so unapologetically bad I didn't get to experience any food ... good or bad.  Hopefully Giovanni's refunded my credit card correctly so I can suppress this bad experience.

UPDATE:  Giovanni's not only charged my credit card but added the tip for non-service.  Thanks for teaching me a lesson ... pay for pick-up after receiving the food."}
{"text":"Can't do a half and half pizza? And 2 dollars per topping seriously? That's trash im sorry."}
{"text":"Well while staying at hotels, I always ask for menus. I saw this in yelp and thought It probably a hit or miss kind of place so I took my chance. Yeah it's okay not a miss nor a hit with me. 
I should of got the hint when the lady or (girl at that) that answered the phone, dont have any skills in taking an order. Not a thank you or anything. 

I ordered a gyro platter with a mountain dew and I got a gourmet pizza and a ginger ale!  Really. I even tip the driver well. 
I called Giovanni and explain about my order and of course not a sorry for the confusion or anything just a \"give him back the pizza\" just like that. Then she called me to tell me the driver is there, \"don't forget to give him the pizza\"  Not a SORRY for the confusion nor a thank you. 
Now I have my gyro with cold soggy fries and no mountain dew but a hot ginger ale, like I have a stomach virus. No fork, like I can eat with my fingers!  no napkins and a bland gyro. 
Giovanni you should get a person with people skills and a training from Giovanni's in NY!  Never again!"}
{"text":"Pizza, pizza!

This is usually my go-to lunch spot when I want to stuff my face full of tasty pizza. The best thing about Giovanni's is their lunch specials. Like most pizza joints they have an assortment of different options, but I always stick with the 2 slices and side salad for $6.99. The slices are HUGE. Now I always eat both, however, I am always full.

If you like a sweet sauce then by all means place your order now. The dough is a traditional, hand-tossed pie which I love. I mean. What makes a pizza bad really?"}
{"text":"Worst customer service I've ever experienced. I placed an order for a pizza over the phone and was told it would be ready in 20 minutes. I went in to pick up my pizza but it wasn't ready yet (no big deal). I was told that it would be ready in 10 minutes so I said ok and waited. 20 minutes later it still wasn't ready and I was told it would be ready when it was ready. I asked to speak to the manager and the girl who rang me up told me to go back to his office myself. After an hour of waiting my pizza was finally ready and as I was walking out of the pizzeria I was shoved by an employee. I will never come back here again"}
{"text":"Do not eat here!

We ordered last night, a whole italian hoagie, side salad, and 6 wings. First off, it took 1 hr 15 min to get there. The driver even called me and said he was on my street, and 5 minutes later was still NOT HERE. When he did arrive I asked him if he had trouble finding it or was he busy and he said \"no, I had another order\". So, when we finally got the food, the hoagie was burnt AND cold, the salad was warm and wilted (and very very small for $3.99), lettuce was also slightly browned, and the wings were also WAY overcooked, cold, and nasty brown inside. The blue cheese they serve is just ranch with blue cheese mixed in. Seriously if you make your own ranch, it's not hard to make your own REAL blue cheese, not that ranch-mixed crap.

Did I mention that 8 hours later, my boyfriend and I were both vomiting and had diarrhea? I immediately threw their menu in the garbage."}
{"text":"Not long ago my husband placed an online order with Giovanni's to the tune of $76 for his crew working downtown...he realized the time he put in defaulted to P.M. instead of A.M. on the website when he went to pick up the order at 11 A.M. and it wasn't ready. Because of time constraints on the job he had to cancel the order. He was assured that the owner would call him to rectify the problem...He never called... We made numerous attempts to get a credit for the charge, to no avail!  So we paid $76  and never received anything for it!  Poor business practice on Giovanni's part...They lost a customer in us ...watch your wallet when you order from them!"}
{"text":"Honestly nothing good about this place. Service was terrible-waitress was acting like it was a chore to have a customer to take care of...Service was extremely slow too. I got a margherita pizza, wings, and garlic knots.
Garlic knots-decent, loaded with butter and garlic. Best part of the meal
Wings-1 step above Pizza Hut. Overlooked.
Pizza-sauce was cheapest quality possible-no taste, bland...the three shreds of basil were wilted and showed signs of rust, and the tomatoes were midwestern which should not be used as a topping...they are earthy and taste like the ground...not good, will never go back. Red Baron will give them a run for their money."}
{"text":"Ordered pizzas for a get together we were having. They had a special one xl gourmet pizza and get a medium cheese free. We ordered the supreme and it tasted good. Flavorful and the sauce was sweet. We also got a large Greek salad my sister and I shared it but it would be enough for one person to eat by themselves. The only thing is they didn't give us Greek salad dressing with the salad and they didn't have have tzatziki sauce with it. It was pretty good pizza though and I would come back but I am just visiting. My sister said they order all the time from there so I can see why they like it."}
{"text":"great food across the board, not just pizza. Delivery is always fast and reliable"}
{"text":"You guys are the best.  Orders about 20 minutes before they closed, picked up a large cheese pizza.  Got here in 20 minutes and the price was right on! The pica was great, you couldn't ask for a bette Rosie at 1:54am In the morning.  The delivery guy was really nice too, gave him $5 for delivering at the end of a shift.  
If you are in the need for some decent Italian and want it delivered at almost 2:00am, this place won't let you down.  Thank you again!!!!"}
{"text":"We had a great dinner tonight - and every time we come here. We split a spinach and feta pizza that has as it's description \"Third best in North America\" and I believe it. My (adult)  daughter had the penne with vodka sauce and loved it. The portion size was enormous and the flavor was excellent. And I could go on and on about their amazing garlic bread. This place has lots of delivery orders but I'm always surprised that more people don't choose to eat in. They've expanded the seating area so there's no waiting. Check this restaurant out!"}
{"text":"Delivery time was terrible. The delivery guy didn't even leave the restaurant until we called asking where our order was....AN HOUR LATER! And it's still not here. Don't waste your time. Order from somewhere else."}
{"text":"Very good pizza. A lot of ppl raved about the sauce on Yelp and I must say the same. It was really good. We ordered an XL for delivery and it was a bit soggy in the middle but overall it was really great. 

My greatest complaint was with the delivery driver. Our total came to $32 and I payed with two $20 bills. It was as if he knew the shtick. He said \"I'm sorry all I have is three $1 bills and left my wallet in the car.\" So I was \"forced\" to give him the $5 tip. I have no problem tipping delivery man by for Pete's sake I feel that that is a little dishonest."}
{"text":"1st time and last time I go.  Ordered a pizza and got a 20 min quote.  Sat in the place for over 45 mins just to find out my pizza was ready since I got there.  The place wasn't even busy.  Pizza was bland (and cold!).   Avoid this place."}
{"text":"Great place for takeout, never dined in. Generous portions enough to share. The pasta, pizza, and salads are delicious. Spend $30 or more and get free cheesy bread."}
{"text":"Love love love their pizza! Tons of tiny pepperoni and lots of cheese. The sauce is on the sweeter side and it's so good. Crust is thinner but not crispy, just right!  Needless to say I love this pizza and frequently get it on my lunch break."}
{"text":"The staff were great and friendly. We by accident ordered from their other location and they were totally understanding. That's pretty much the only good thing. All of the pasta is overcooked, the eggplant is undercooked, and anything with red sauce tastes like sugar syrup. I thought perhaps it would be more authentic in taste because they put the salad on top of the warm stuff. I guess not."}
{"text":"I get take out from this place about once a week, since they're one of the few places deliver free to my place.
The hoagies are verryyy good and also the Pittsburgh style pizza is recommended. I guess the only thing I tried at didn't like was the specialty pizza."}
{"text":"I love ordering Giovanni's. Their pizza always comes hot and fresh. Late night and on game nights it's though to get a delivery on time, but when it arrives it definitely hits the spot. I'm not too fancy-- usually just stick with a pepperoni pizza-- but it never disappoints! The buffalo fries are a huge hit too. Just keep in mind that delivery does take a while, so be patient."}
{"text":"This is the absolute, bar none, sweetest pizza ever. By sweet I mean sugary. The sauce is ridiculous. And I could tolerate it if it was the natural sweetness of tomatoes; it is not. They dumped an obscene amount of sugar in there. I couldn't even taste the cheese or the vegetables on the pizza. The only savory taste came from the meatballs, which were not that great. I also had their cheesecake. Not horrible, with a nice cheese tang, but again ungodly sweet for cheesecake. I ordered strawberry cheesecake. It came with a strawberry \"topping\", and that is used loosely. This had to be the worst topping/jam I have ever eaten. Nothing but sugar, and no fruit taste."}
{"text":"They had a sign out front that said \"We Sell Slice.\" I'm down with your grammar, dude. 

The slice was pretty good and hearty but at $3 per, they were kinda pricey. The crust was heavier than a thin crust and more flaky, and the sauce was okay. The oil and texture suggested that the slice had been cooked twice, and I think you would strongly benefit from ordering a fresh pie if you brought enough crew to make that an appropriate order. Outside of the pie, the bread twists with pepperoni were damn good, probably better than the pizza. The acoustical tiles in the ceiling have seen better days, so it's not exactly an anniversary dinner spot if you get my drift, but a fine enough stop for slice on the way to the ballgame."}
{"text":"Everything was A+. My boyfriend and I got the GF Penne w/ Alfredo sauce, GF Chicken Parm sub, and the GF Chicken Ranchero pizza. We are visiting from out of town and after our experience we wish they would deliver to Virginia! Couldn't recommend this place enough, especially if you are restricted by a gluten free diet and miss pizza, pasta, and subs."}
{"text":"BUYER BEWARE.  I have had Giovanni's several times, but this time the cheese has a horrible flavor.  Definitely moldy tasting.  I called and while they will refund my money they seemed unconcerned at all that I might get sick OR that the quality of the pizza is so bad.  Given their lack of care that my pizza had moldy cheese, they have lost a once loyal customer.  TEST THE CHEESE BEFORE YOU EAT TOO MUCH!"}
{"text":"Giovanni's is the sort of business that demands I stop what I'm doing and write a glowing - albeit limited - review. I'm ashamed at having waited this long to do so. 

My GF and I were in town for the New England debacle around Halloween and stayed at a nearby hotel. A quick Yelp check revealed that Giovanni's was THE place for pizza in the area. So we ordered. Then we ordered again. 

After that, we order some more.

I can't rave enough about how large, delicious and filling their Texas Roadhouse Steak hoagies are. 15 minutes after calling in, my order arrived. I swear I heard carols of angels singing as I unwrapped the paper. Inside were steak, onion rings, provolone cheese, fried onions, peppers and mushrooms lathered in a spicy Santa Fe sauce. 

The memory stimulates my salivary glands as I type.

Need I go on?

But don't stop reading now. Because the pizzas are also large and tasty: Freshly baked bread, excellent sauces and a wonderful assortment of meat toppings. 

Corporate pizzeria conglomerates: Are you taking notes?

Because if the owners ever think to expand, Giovanni's will...well, eat your lunch."}
{"text":"Absolutely TERRIBLE service! Delivered us the wrong pizza. Second time they came with the correct pizza, but the driver misunderstood their boss and left it for the hotel front desk staff to eat!!! We NEVER GOT OUR PIZZA. They are the most incompetent staff I have ever encountered. Here's what happened. Last night at 9:26 I called and placed an order for a medium pizza, half cheese half broccoli and onion, to be delivered to the double tree hotel downtown. At 9:59 the driver called me to meet him in the lobby, we paid cash, tipped $5 and discovered upon opening it in our room that it was a mushroom pizza. I called the place at 10:04 and let the girl know the driver brought the wrong pizza. She said they would send it out again and would be 20 minutes. At 10:48 I called because it had been so long, and the girl said the driver couldn't get ahold of me and left it at the front desk. I let her know they did not call me and the hotel didn't call my room. She said to go down and check. When I asked the girl at the front desk if our pizza was there she said, wait, did it have broccoli? I said YES, what happened. She said the delivery driver told her it was for them, and that sometimes the places drop off free pizzas because the hotel hands out their menus. So, I called the pizza place back and the same girl I'd been dealing with said I was right, and that the driver never called and he misunderstood their manager. She said they would send a new pizza. I asked for my money back too, but she said they couldn't do both!?!? Like WTF, it's been almost two hours since I placed my order, they screwed it up royally, and they can't give me a free pizza to make it \"right\"? Where is the common decency? Then she had the audacity to ask if I also wanted my tip back. Um...YES! Duh. And when the driver called me telling me he was in the lobby with the money, i left the hotel bar quickly to meet him, he wasn't there, he was parking his car. Lies, lies, lies. I will never spend my money there again, it's a place who doesn't give a crap about integrity and doing great business. Never ordering from there again. Ever."}
{"text":"Decent quick lunch.

This will be a quick and painless review, much like my experience at Giovanni's. 

I am usually looking for a quick cheap lunch downtown and am not left with a lot of good options.  Giovanni's looked promising so I ordered 2 slices of pepperoni.  The girls working were friendly and prompt and price was definitely fair.  The pizza itself was decent.  The crust was floppy and had absorbed a little too much grease from the cheese and pepperoni for my liking, but overall I'll say it was just above average.

Wouldn't mind trying some of their other options, but I'll probably just grab another slice in a pinch."}
{"text":"The Yelp order app and even a phone call got screwed up.  Very unprofessional person answered phone.  Way lay on order, no apology."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! We've lived on the other side of Concord until recently and never tried it. I dismissed it because it was a shopping center place. This is the best pizza I've had in the Concord/ Kannapolis area. The Sicilian is GREAT!!! We've had 3 different pasta dishes and they were so yummy. Tonight I got a cheese steak and it was spot on! They have earned our loyalty and we'll be regulars."}
{"text":"We love Giovanni's pizza.  The service here has always be excellent too!  We used to go here all the time, but then we went vegan...and therefore stopped ordering for a few years.  A few weeks ago on a whim, I emailed them and asked if they'd consider adding a vegan pizza option.  Much to my delight, they agreed!  We ordered our first vegan pizza last night and it was perfect!  How we missed their delicious bubbly crust and sweet tomato sauce!  The folks were also incredibly pleasant about our dietary restrictions and were sure to use separate tools for handling the pizza to avoid cross-contamination.  It was great and we are thrilled to be able to patronize our favorite local pizza shop again.  I don't know if the vegan pizza option will catch on, but we plan to continue ordering as long as they have it available.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years.  Best Italian and a great price!!!!!  Great servers, efficient and always a smile!!!"}
{"text":"In an interesting and exciting recent development surely influenced by rival Mineo's, this Giovanni's franchise has added a dessert shop next door (same address, though) that specializes in gelato and chocolate candies, all of which are homemade. This subdivision, named Giovanni's Chocolate Factory, was inspected by Kay and I the other evening after dining at Mt. Lebanon's Little Tokyo, and it mostly passes. I was a bit annoyed when we were told that the gelato was gone for the day, but I did manage to take home a half-pound of assorted chocolates that ranged from salted caramels and coated marshmallows to  toffee bark and crunchy things containing peanut butter. Every last bit of candy in that elegant box  was an interfusion of  lasciviousness and loving attention to detail. Either demons or grandmothers are making this fabulous candy. Stop in and give them a try."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza! We ordered the Giovanni's special last night and picked it up... We have never been here before, but wanted to try something different. It was so good! Yummy thin crust, sauce perfectly seasoned, and adequate topping amount. I wish there had been just a bit more cheese though. We  definitely be back. I want to try the pasta dishes next."}
{"text":"Food is excellent.  My oldest son's favorite place.  We had them cater a party for us and the food was incredible. Highly recommend the Chicken Romano, but haven't had a bad thing here."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service.    Food shows up so hot you can't touch it.  Like it came out of the oven 30 seconds ago.    Nice business hours.   Very delicious pizza....and I'm a snob when it comes to pizza.  My favorite in the golden triangle.  Prices are reasonable. Orders are always accurate.    Would recommend."}
{"text":"This place gets crowded on weekends.  

Had a coupon for pizza, wings and cheese bread.  The pizza is good with a crust that is not thin but not to thick and the sauce is simple, not to spicy and maybe a little on the sweet side.  The topping were fresh and good!  Liked the wings, crisp and tasty with just the right amount of heat.

The cheese bread, Yum, gooey cheese inside bread with cheese and garlic."}
{"text":"Real good, and real hot! Great staff, this is a very quaint little neighborhood pizzeria."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and never go here. Worst customer service! Ordered online and waited over an hour to find out that they were too incompetent to figure out how to receive the online order. Spoke to the manager (after waiting on hold for 10 minutes) and I received no apology or resolution as I kindly explained the situation. She told me that she's just a manager and I should go to their website to file a complaint. Stuck going to Wendy's and ironically they apologized for making me wait 10 seconds."}
{"text":"Called to place a carry out order at 9:30pm and was told they were no longer taking orders for the night. Hours online say they do not close until 10pm. Poor customer service."}
{"text":"We came to giovanis for a quick dinner before our movie. It was our first time in pittsburgh.  I only got one slice but after eating it we went back for two more it was so delicious.  We've been back to pittsburgh three times now and stop in our favorite pizza at Least once every time."}
{"text":"Pizza was great but the place could use a good cleaing and updated.  The tables were gross.  The pizza were really good.  We had a meatlovers and the Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Per my original review when I first moved into that city,  I loved their late night delivery and thought their pies were tasty.

However, I've probably put in over 20 deliveries this year and can see the inconsistencies.  My waistline shows...

1. Your pizza  sauce is delicious.   Perfect sweet/garlic balance. 

2.  Your meatballs are not good.  I will no longer pay a premium for your 16 inch baguette loaded with freezer burnt meatballs and a spoonful of your delicious sauce.

3. How...how do you get off on charging such a high premium to customize a pie?????  I ordered a medium mushroom and onion and it cost me $20+

Regardless, you pie slingers continue to provide much needed late night vittles.  I hope (for your sake), that you can accept the above criticism and improve on consistency."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for pizza at the recommendation of our limo driver for a bachelorette party. Took FOREVER to get the pizza. The sauce was SUPER sweet. And I like sweet sauce, but this was exceptionally sweet. But somehow, we all LOVED it. It was like crack. The pizza was gone in like 5 min it felt like. I'd order here again."}
{"text":"Soooo. I went in and ordered a large pizza.  I paid for it and sat down waiting for my pizza. Out of no where a huge rat walked right past my feet. I thought it might be a pet until the cashier lady was gasping for breath in spoke of what we just seen. I don't know about you but that's just plain nasty. Enjoy your rat pizza if you decide to eat their. Yuk. And the place is very dirty."}
{"text":"We were in town for a baseball game and looking for something on our way walking from ballpark to hotel. We ducked into Giovanni's and were prepared for some average pizza... OMG, we would probably drive back to PA just for that delicious sweet sauce. Perfect pizza from crust to cheese. Place is tiny and was packed with people waiting for their pies... I can imagine this place gets elbow to elbow at times. ONE TIP: Let the pizza cool before you eat it, pick up a hot slice and you lose all your cheese not to mention it's molten hot out of the oven. AMAZING."}
{"text":"Simply delicious pizza! We eat there for lunch on occasion. The service is always fast and friendly. I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Their tomato sauce is too sweet. I swear they pour sugar in it. Not a fan of that."}
{"text":"This place was dead, but it was 1:30 pm. The server didn't give her name, but was  nice . We told her we were in a hurry, and got the chicken gyro quickly.  It was stuffed full, and tasty  though not very warm. The server nicely offered to sub Spring mix for the iceberg lettuce, which made it more flavorful. It came with a creamy cucumber sauce which  was nearly tasteless. I would put dill in the sauce.
I would come back, and have this, or their wings (which are pretty decent). 
Iwould suggest that the server  HAND the change to the customer. It's my pet peeve."}
{"text":"My favorite spot in the city for both pasta and pizza.  Their sauces have great variation, and are crafted in shop daily.  The pizza has a distinct crust texture that other shops don't offer, it's a combination of flaky and mid level crust, which often don't combine, it's usually one or the other.

Service is always quick, friendly and accurate.  Their lunch specials offer ample portions at prices cheaper than fast food restaurants for lunch, all the while offering superior home cooked quality!"}
{"text":"I have read a lot about how slow their delivery is, and I don't understand how as I walked in to order to go and was out the door under 20 minutes - of course there are other logistical issues with delivery.

The Food:
We ordered a medium bacon and meatball and a grilled chicken salad.

The Salad: The salad was extremely underwhelming, warm, wilted lettuce and so little grilled chicken.  I like a nice crisp, cold salad, and if I ask for chicken I expect more than 4 or 5 small chicken strips.

The Pizza:  I really enjoyed the crust on this pizza, better than most I have had in Pittsburgh, but the sauce was awful.  The sauce was plentiful, which is a plus, but it was extremely sweet, almost like eating candy.  There is enough cheese on the pizza, IMO just the right amount.  The big junks of meatball were pretty good, not great, but good, and as for the bacon, where is it?  I didn't see nor taste bacon except for a bite or two.

I will try Giovanni's again, but will stay away from the salad and may just go for traditional pepperoni as a topping next time.  I will also give their pasta a shot at some point!"}
{"text":"Great gluten free pizza! Service was excellent. Would re-visit if we come back to Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Had a horrible experience with this restaurant I had ordered a pizza to my hotel room and was told it would take 45 minutes! Well after about an hour and a half I called back to see where the pizza was and they told me it was on its way, well then I waited another 30 minutes and called again they said it's on it's way so after 2 hours of waiting I decided to call the hotel to make sure they didn't get the room wrong the hotel said that know no had came in it's now 3am and the restaurant is closed so I can't even call them!! The next day I call to see what happened and to get my money back and the manager wants to start arguing with me telling me that they brought it and tried to call me someone's lying here!!!! poor customer service wouldn't recommend this place to an enemy!"}
{"text":"Large portions, great prices, fabulous service, and a gluten free menu. Best pizza joint in town!"}
{"text":"Talk to me about Gryos. Do you want the meat shaved off an 'elephant's leg', succulent and fresh, as a gyro or doner kebab usually is, or processed and heated up in a microwave? If your answer is the latter, happy dining"}
{"text":"It's funny because i liked pizza prior to being gluten free, but I didn't LOVE it like people do. Well, when I was told I basically couldn't have it at most places of course I NEEDED IT ASAP!

So now I've been on the quest to find the best gluten free pizza. This place definitely delivers (and to your house too, natch). While you can tell the crust is GF, I think it's pretty close to a Neapolitan style pizza crust. While I've had GF pizza that has a crispy crust, the center gets pretty mushy, and this was not the case.

But just as important are the toppings. i totally went for it with a buffalo chicken pizza and it was super tasty. I hate when they put like one piece of flimsy chicken or toppings, and they had big hunks of chicken with a tangy buffalo sauce. 

The most surprising thing was that GF pizza never usually reheats well for leftovers. To my surprise, it tasted great still! I will most definitely add them to my list of good GF pizza options and glad to have them in my hood!"}
{"text":"Great sauce. My friends and I come to Pittsburgh for an annual trip. Giovanni's is our late-night call."}
{"text":"We love their sausage pizza. We love everything on their menu. It is really good food.  We have never eaten in the restaurant, we always get delivery. The food is always good."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery from this restaurant and mistakenly looked at the menu for the South Hills location (granted, our fault). We tried to order a spinach, feta, and tomato bread twist and were told that we would be charged an extra $5 because they would have to \"specially make it\" since it wasn't on their menu. We then tried to order a small buffalo chicken salad and were told it didn't exist, and we could order a regular sized one for $12 (it is listed on their menu as $10). They have a small grilled chicken salad, but no buffalo. How hard is it to add buffalo to the grilled chicken?!

The food arrived and we had been charged incorrectly for the wings and the salad, the ice we requested didn't arrive, the pizza was cold, and one of the salads didn't come with the garlic bread or dressing. We called to request that they fix our order, and we were told that we were wrong. The manager was really argumentative, so finally we just asked for our money back. They told us because we had only ordered from them once (which wasn't true) we couldn't get our money back. Why does that even matter? They finally agreed to give us our money back but said they would pick up the food. WHAT?! You want the food back?! Why in the world would you return the food that we have already opened?

We had eaten the small salad (which was a tiny, tiny salad for almost $8) so they told us we couldn't have our money back for it since it was eaten.

The worst service I have ever, ever seen. I would recommend staying away from this place at all costs."}
{"text":"We live in Polish Hill and often have a hard time finding quality pizzerias and restaurants from the East End that will deliver to us---presumably because we are just a \"tad\" too far outside their delivery radius or because we share a zip code with the \"dreaded\" Hill District. 

One day we found a Giovanni's door-hanger with coupons shoved in our mailbox, and given that I had also just worked a long day delivering food for another business I decided to give it a shot. I'm so glad I did!

We've regularly been ordering Giovanni's for delivery ever since. I tend to not eat much all day due to my hectic work schedule and then GORGE myself late at night. I've ordered buffalo chicken and/or Greek-styled salads several times now, loaded with every topping imaginable (anchovies, double feta cheese, french fries, black olives, gyro meat, double dressings, etc.), and each time they've been delicious AND correct! Normally since the salad toppings are compartmentalized within the clam shell plastic container I'll drag a pot out from the kitchen and toss the salad around in it with the dressing and then eat it right from the pot! With rare exception the salads have been average to above-average. There was one occasion where I didn't want to eat any more of my chicken because so much of it was gristly, but everything else has been consistently edible and tasty. Considering I've had low-quality gristly chicken in a LOT of restaurants lately I'm beginning to think this is more of a Pittsburgh problem than a Giovanni's problem. 

The other reviewers are correct that the pizza sauce's sweetness is an acquired taste. We like sweeter sauce, so for us Giovanni's is a smashing hit. We've ordered several different types of pizzas over the past year or so, and we've never found ourselves disappointed in the taste or quality. Most of the time we find we have to re-cut the pizza slices, though, as they aren't cut all the way through. I'd rather wait an extra minute for my pizza to be properly cut than to have to cut it myself at home when all I want to do is graze like a cow after a 12-hour shift at work, but that's a small complaint. 

Finally, I've never before had an eatery \"reward\" me for ordering online. Giovanni's provides customers who place online delivery orders above a certain dollar amount with a free order of cheesy bread (more like a cheese stromboli)! I'm not a fan of it just as it comes, so we usually add extra cheese and/or pepperoni to kick it up a notch for $1 or $2 additional. Typically when we order a large pizza, modified (free) cheesy bread, and one of these overloaded custom salads (that they actually had to call on once to verify I indeed wanted all of those toppings!) we have food for three days, so while this might run us $45-$50, including tip, it's in-line for what we'd spend for three day's worth of food for both of us otherwise. 

Is this the best pizza I've ever had? No. Is it in my \"Top 5\" for Pittsburgh? Yes. 

Are these the best salads I've ever had? No. Are they in my \"Top 5\" for Pittsburgh? Possibly. Then again if I want just a delicious fresh salad I'd definitely just head to Whole Foods."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery from Giovanni's and it was quite delicious.  It took about 45 minutes, which they let us know. Pros: We had pizza with sausage, meatball twist bread, and buffalo wings. The pizza and the meatball bread were amazing.  I really enjoyed the little bit sweet, little bit spicy pizza sauce.  Cons: The wings were over cooked and the buffalo sauce wasn't very spicy.  I wouldn't order them again from there.  /:"}
{"text":"Yum. I order online so easy you can schedule for pickup and delivery. They list their specials online as well. Coupons and everything - just click and add it to your cart and make up your pizza. Loved the Buffalo Chicken pizza. WHO would have thought about French fries on a pizza. Love their bread twists and you can customize them with different fillings (pepperoni makes it like a pepperoni roll - so yummy!)"}
{"text":"Ordered online, food showed up cold 2:15 later. Managements response was sorry about your luck. 

Last time ordering from here."}
{"text":"My husband LOVES NY style pizza and has had his share. At first look of his slice and the restaurant, he questioned it. But he said it was one of his favorite slices to date. We stumbled into this place because our car was in the garage across the street, and we got lucky! I would highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"So-so pizza; better than the stuff the chain stores (pizza hut et al) make anyway"}
{"text":"Ordered online and paid with a credit card. When the driver showed up I took the pizza and was about to enter my home. The driver screamed at me about needing paid. I let him know the pizza has been paid for and showed him the order confirmation on my phone. He continued screaming \"cash only\" so I just gave the pizza back and went inside. I probably ended up on some \"do not deliver\" list for not paying (when I actually had) but that's cool. From the pictures posted I guess all I'm missing out on is some greasy disgusting slop crudely cut into triangles

The business owner responded saying there was a problem with the online ordering function. Well maybe that was something the delivery driver should have considered before screaming at me in the street"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery this evening. Took 40 minutes which isn't bad at rush hour at all! I ordered the buffalo chicken pizza, which is always my go to. Anything that starts with buffalo chicken usually catches my eye. The pizza was still nice and hot when it arrived, and I received a huge side of ranch, which is KEY for anything buffalo chicken. Ingredients were fresh, and higher quality than most. I would definitely recommend."}
