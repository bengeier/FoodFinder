{"text":"This place is my guilty pleasure.  I get the fried dumplings with szechuan sauce, chicken lo mein, and pork fried rice - and it lasts for three meals for like $12.  Can't beat that!  The lady at the counter always remembers my husband's name too :-)"}
{"text":"Delicious dumplings/potstickers. (Pork, fried), Tasty Gen. Tso's chicken- very good sauce and chicken (I requested white meat). Love their  wonton soup. Veggies are always fresh and crisp, not mushy. The service is  exceptionally friendly and accommodating. Very clean. I wish they delivered! By far our favorite Chinese in Champaign. We moved and still drive 20 min from the far side of Urbana. Lunch specials are a great deal as well. My sister said the beef with broccoli was as good as the place she buys from in NYC, where she lived for four years."}
{"text":"So pleased with this place, it prompted me to make a Yelp profile! 

Good, standard Chinese menu, but everything has that little something else... vegetables are fresh, sauces have real flavor.

It's absolutely what I want when I'm craving this kind of Chinese!  Fried dumplings, Mongolian beef (best in town, I think!), General Tso's that carries both the spicy and sweet perfectly, sesame beef, boneless honey ribs.  I just haven't had anything here I didn't like!

Add to that, it's clean (really clean!), organized, pleasant to wait in, and the staff are pleasant and efficient and make you feel welcome.   This is my go-to now!"}
{"text":"We've taken out from here several times over the years, and it was neither good nor bad, just ordinary take-out, but usually worth the trip for a quick dinner. Until tonight, when it was bad, just bad. Chicken with rice soup? They should call it a lot of wet rice with a few bits of chicken. Is soupless soup the new thing? That went straight into the fridge: I'll think about adding chicken broth, ginger, and maybe some shredded carrots. To salvage the flavorless shrimp lo mein and chicken fried rice, I had to re-stir fry each dish in a bit of sesame oil, adding generous amounts of sliced fresh ginger and minced garlic, and some soy sauce, along with vegetables (just some limp onions in the original, so I put in chopped peppers and some frozen peas). The alternative was throwing it all out and cooking pasta instead, but I was determined to get something for the $20 I shelled out tonight. I've never tried those places where you pick up a pizza, take it home, and bake it in the oven. But now I can say I've done something quite similar with Chinese take-out. Not an experience I want to repeat, but I suppose Julia Child would have been pleased with the salvage efforts."}
{"text":"I discovered Green Jade not long ago. I ordered my favorite Chinese dish, House Special Angel Hair, and it was good and not greasy. The portion was also big. The place looks clean and the cashier is friendly. I think it's a good place for take-out!!!"}
{"text":"The best place in CU for orange chicken!!!"}
{"text":"got takeout from here the other night with the boy and was pleasantly surprised. don't know if i'd sit down and eat in-house (quite small and with all the pickups it was really busy and cold) but definitely our place to go for takeout. 
i got the tofu with veggies and garlic sauce...tofu was done just right and the veggies were nice and crisp still, just the way i like it. the sauce wasn't overly-oily and had a great flavor, and the rice was perfectly cooked.
the boy got general tso's chicken (extra spicy) and loved every bite of it.
prices are totally fair (about $8 for each dish and we had leftovers for another meal the next day) and the service is awesome.  
though this is for sure \"americanized\" chinese food, it definitely hit the spot and we will return."}
{"text":"Our first visit, and my mom and I ate in at one of the half-dozen tables.  Food was prepared quickly, and served by friendly and helpful staff.  It's a relaxed atmosphere, and is a family-run business.  Great fresh ingredients in the house special soup, which was a meal in itself with a little bit of everything, and the moo goo gai pan was flavorful with lots of fresh veggies and perfectly cooked chicken.   The sweet-and-sour pork was kind of average, though not bad.  

 My mom is elderly and takes a while to eat, but as most of the customers were waiting for takeout orders, there was no pressure for her to finish quickly.  It's bus-your-own table, all the tea you can drink, and although it was difficult for the air conditioning to keep with the heat generated from the kitchen, it wasn't unpleasant.  We had enough leftovers for lunch tomorrow, too!  Worth a return visit, definitely!"}
{"text":"I've been getting take-out from here for years and decided that it was time to post a review.  Best things about going here are the very pleasant staff, the very fresh vegetables and the great flavor profiles, all coming from a small (clean) kitchen at reasonable prices.   Dishes I really like are the hot & sour soup, hunan chicken, chicken with broccoli, and singapore angel hair.  But others I've ordered have also been very good.

There is limited seating for dine-in, but I've never seen it completely full.  Self-serve hot tea is available, and there is a selection of  soft drinks available."}
{"text":"One of my go-to Chinese places in Champaign.  Great service, great food, good ingredients."}
{"text":"Green Jade is Boyfriend's Chinese place of choice, so I've been eating here fairly regularly for over a year. I had never been super impressed, but usually mostly satisfied with my food. 

This, fellow Yelpers, was entirely MY fault. I kept ordering things from the regular menu like sesame chicken and sweet and sour chicken and pork lo mein, expecting awesome. Don't get me wrong, those items are solid, even good. But not socks-off-knocking. The real beauty here is apparently in THE SPECIALS. ORDER THE SPECIALS.

We've been to Green Jade twice in the past six weeks. The first visit, I tried the garlic eggplant special. Oh. Wow. I love eggplant, and this was eggplant done right. Well done!

The second visit, I was disappointed that there was no eggplant special. Boo. However, they DID have a green bean and pork special. Oh. Wow. 

So, here's a tip - go to Green Jade. Order one of the specials! Also, if you like soup, they have the best egg drop soup in Champaign."}
{"text":"We go here because the guy who owns it is named Eugene. And how do I know this? Because he told me, and then we had a great conversation about how much we both love New York, and then he made really good orange chicken for me, which is now the only thing I ever order here. The orange chicken at Green Jade reminds me of one of my other vices, the orange chicken from Panda Express. Only at Panda, Eugene isn't there."}
{"text":"Good food but nothing special. Don't expect exceptional quality, but it is a solid place to get a large quantity of decent fried rice for cheap. Would recommend the house special fried rice. Overall not bad if you live nearby and want something quick."}
{"text":"This place is great. I love their orange chicken (of course) and their sesame chicken is incredible, too. It is ready within 30-40 minutes of me calling them, and is always piping hot when I get it out. Also, the containers they give you the food in are re-usable and even survive my dishwasher. I really love this place on a lazy Sunday when I don't want to do anything but eat a bunch of food and crash again."}
{"text":"We stopped in here because they advertise that they don't use MSG.  My wife is allergic to preservatives.  The food was plentiful, and OK.  Nothing great, but not terrible either.  However, not long after eating there my wife started getting her normal allergic reaction.  Not sure if they indeed did use MSG or not, but there was certainly some sort of preservative on the food.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"SO much better than the take out we used to get from another local Chinese restaurant. The cashew chicken has large chunks of fresh veggies (zucchini, snow peas, carrots, mushrooms, celery and water chestnuts), good quality chicken, and they're not stingy with the cashews either. I can also vouch for the Lo Mein, Vegetable Fried rice (again, plentiful with the fresh veggies), and Beef & Broccoli. Reasonably priced, and very large portions. I always order online and they have everything ready for the time I want it ready to pick up. Just click \"menu\", then you can put the various items in your cart."}
{"text":"Love Green Jade!  Get take out from here once a week.  The people who run it are very nice, although a bit hard to understand on the phone.  Great quantity of food for how much you pay.  They do have on-line ordering as well from what I understand, although I've never tried."}
{"text":"I really like this place as to-go Chinese, but the past few times I've gone, it's been lacking... one time I ordered sweet and sour chicken and got no sweet and sour sauce (kind of an essential part of the meal.)  The next time, they forgot my egg roll.  The food is good and the people really nice, the value is good - especially the lunch deal! - but I'm a little soured on it after having parts of my order missing.  I guess I need to start checking my order before I leave the restaurant."}
{"text":"This is a great Chinese restaurant depending on what you order. Some of their food can be a bit bland for my tastes, but they'll add more spice to anything if you request it and like a bit more heat. Their General Tso's Chicken and Orange Chicken are probably their two best dishes. I'd also recommend their pot stickers, though the sauce can have a strong garlic taste so be forewarned if that's not your thing. They have an incredibly friendly staff and keep a nice, clean kitchen (which you can see for yourself as you wait for your order) and are a great low-cost alternative for Chinese food in CU."}
{"text":"The owner is super nice and the price is very reasonable. It might not be as fancy as other chinese restaurants in town, but it is still a decent place to get a quick bite or an additional dish to your dinner."}
{"text":"Don't give total over the phone or take a name. So that's worries me. Forgot fortune cookie. Not spicy."}
{"text":"5/5 stars for Green Jade based on our first time here. 

We spent just over $25 for 2 appetizers (crab rangoon & vegetable egg rolls), 2 entrees (broccoli w/ garlic sauce & pork lo mean) and extra rice. Not bad. We ordered the large sizes, too. I loved the variety of vegetables in the broccoli dish; it even had some green beans in it!

The crab rangoons were probably my favorite part of the meal. They were the perfect size and shape and the perfect amount of fried. The filling was more cream cheese than crab, which I actually prefer. Sweet & sour sauce included, too!

Convenient location. Restaurant is so close to our house that I have a feeling we'll be here at least once a month."}
{"text":"I love the food at this place. They have always been accommodating with my orders! I would recommend calling ahead if you are doing to-go orders. It takes about 10-15 minutes to make. Great service and great food!"}
{"text":"Great food! Friendly service. Free hot tea in the dining area. The owner recognizes my voice and the details of my order, which I appreciate so I don't have to repeat all of the details every time: fried tofu in black bean sauce, no vegetables, add mushrooms, etc. It is quick and easy. Love it!"}
{"text":"Our go-to for Chinese take-out!  I love that they are not afraid to make something more spicy (WAY more spicy) if you ask for  extra spicy!  (Some places just won't make it very hot, maybe they think you'll bring it back or something.)    My husband loves their lo-mein, while I am a huge fan of all of their spicy vegetarian dishes.  Always friendly and super-fast!"}
{"text":"The food here was not good. When I want Chinese food, I go to Golden Harbor. I happened to be in the area and needed to grab something quickly before heading back to work. I figured I'd give it a shot.

I had seen some good reviews for this place so I figured I'd give it a shot. Before I commit to a full meal at a new Chinese restaurant, I order the hot and sour soup. It never fails, I can tell how good (or not) the restaurant will be based on their hot and sour soup. I ordered a hot and sour soup and an order of egg rolls to go. They prepared both items as soon as I placed them. So that was a plus. The woman who took my order was friendly and the restaurant looked clean; that's where the good experience ended. 

I got back to my office and could tell right away I was not going to be blown away by the soup. Before I even removed the lid, I could tell the soup was littered with pepper. Good hot and sour soup is made spicy using spicy oil, not pepper. The soup tasted purely like pepper broth and was lacking the \"sour\" part. It was also full of fillers that one does not encounter in hot and sour soup (e.g. cabbage). 

Fine, hot and sour soup is time intensive, and not as popular as wonton and egg drop soup. I could let that slide. The part that sealed the deal for me was the raw egg rolls. The very outer shell was crispy but with the first bite, the center was cold and everything but the outermost part of the shell was uncooked. 

Very disappointing. Will not be eating here again."}
{"text":"No no no. What place are you people eating? The reviews looked good but the food was the same bland slop I could get at any stripmall place in the country. Panda Express is better than this. I am not criticizing the owners just the reviewers!"}
{"text":"Quintessential quick and good Chinese food. Go there and try it, it's bound to be better than your usual Chinese take out place.

They are good people as well.... Never had a rude or bitchy person help me. :)

My Vote... Beef Broccoli (boring i know, but the sauce is so good) and boiled dumplings."}
{"text":"The shrimp with lobster sauce is really good. Try it."}
{"text":"You know, I had a decent experience here. It was fast cooking and it was just an easy process of ordering. Prices are normal and portions are huge. I got the combination chow mein and I definitely split that for two meals.

HUGE portions and I thought the taste was good too. Not amazing but really good (I'm sure there are better).

I'd return...it's just a bit out of the ways."}
{"text":"Best chicken w garlic sauce I've ever had. Barely spicy at all - just a strong, crisp flavor.

Hit up the lunch special ($5.68 after tax 11a-3p) so you can enjoy their fried rice as well."}
{"text":"Pretty decent for a typical Chinese food place. I love it just because it's so close to my house. It's definitely not authentic like Sarah said, but it's quick and filling and really clean.

I swear though, I think all Chinese places use the same pictures for their menus. At least they're all appetizing :)"}
{"text":"Wah, I'm sad, my mongolian beef was like 75% onion 25% beef.  And it still cost $8!  I hope this was a fluke guys, cuz I love you!"}
