{"text":"The Little Polish Diner recently catered our rehearsal dinner.  We had about 50 people attend and served stuffed cabbages, kielbasa and kraut, peirogis and cabbage and noodles.  The food was delicious-it was a hit!!!   Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Wanted to try a pierogi and stuff cabbage.  We came across this little place. We started with a cup of stuffed peppers soup,#1  Their Parma Mix plate was fantastic! !"}
{"text":"Such good food!!! If you sometimes long for pierogies and stuffed cabbage, kielbasa & sauerkraut, or chicken paprikash, this is the place for you!  Places like the Little Polish Diner, the Schnitzel House, and State Meats (all in Parma) really bring me back to my childhood!  The tour of Poland is delicious, as is the chicken paprikash when it's available.  This is just an unpretentious little mom-and-pop Polish restaurant and the food is excellent! Don't forget to get a cheese blintz for dessert!"}
{"text":"Love this place, friendly delicious comforting polish food, must try the stuffed cabbage and pierogi!!"}
{"text":"I'm here all the time and my father has practically moved in. Love the pierogis, the Tour of Poland, and the soups, including the pickle soup. Good service, friendly people. Polish word of the day on the menu board. Nice little unassuming place. It's at the end of the block of shops next to Burger King. You'll see a large photo of Warsaw on the exterior side wall. Parking in back, bus 45 for RTA riders."}
{"text":"Great Food, Tour of Poland is Great You need to try it once in you life, Sara was great and the regulars like Joe tell you all about the place and the neighborhood what when where and how. Zofia was born in Poland so she brought all the recipes with her. Great place small just like the name says but worth the time. Great people great food great atmosphere what else do you need? I would give it 10stars but 5 is the max. Go have a Tour of Poland while in Cleveland Ohio!!!!"}
{"text":"Really delicious. Fried perch was great. Noodles and Cabbage tasted like a great comfort food. Pierogi Dinner was a winner too. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"It's cramped. It's old. The decor is hilarious. The menus are charming. In other words, it's perfect. If you're looking for fancy-pants Lola style fare, keep looking. But if you're looking for down-to-earth good ole Polish family recipes in a warm little dining room, look no further!"}
{"text":"I was in the neighborhood with my fiancee looking at houses.  We decided since we are looking in to moving to this area, we'd try a local restaurant.  Since this place had positive reviews, we took a chance.  It is very small inside, but we were able to get seated right away.  Our server came right over and took our drink orders.  She gave us time to look over the menu.  Lots of good, home cooking, comfort food here.  As usual, we were looking for two different types of meals so we could split them and try different things.  I decided on the meatloaf, my fiancee the three cabbage roll dinner.  Well, they ran out of meatloaf, so I decided on the tour of Poland.  The food came in a good amount of time and was piping hot.  The tour of Poland had a couple pierogie, sausage and kraut, and one cabbage roll.  The dinners also came with bread and butter.  The sausage and kraut were delicious, my fiancee really loved it and I thought it was excellent.  The pierogie was good, served with a container of sour cream.  The cabbage roll was great.  Tender cabbage, moist meat, good sauce.   I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"It wasn't bad, nor was it amazing. My husband had the Tour of Poland and said my parents do a much better job (can't beat Mom and Dad). The green beans were also the canned kind, and the dinner rolls aren't \"home made\" either. I had the pierogi dinner with a mix of potato cheddar, sweet cheese and sauerkraut pieces. I enjoyed all three, but honestly feel that we can whip up a similar batch with frozen Mrs T's and add our own sauerkraut. We also had the potato pancakes which were good, but still average. If I needed a quick pierogi fix, and was in the area, I would come here again, but it's not really worth going out of our way."}
{"text":"This is definitely a neighborhood gem!   My sister, a friend and myself make monthly plans to check out a restaurant that serves pierogis we are on the hunt to try them all! This weekend we made it to the Little Polish Diner and it was fabulous. This diner seats about 20 people and is so affordable that you will want to keep coming back. At least that is how I feel!   Between the 3 of us we ordered the Potato & Cheddar, Mushroom & Sauerkraut and Plain Sauerkraut Pierogis, a Cabbage Roll, the Cucumber Salad and the Cheese Blintz's with Strawberry Topping. Everything was extremely delicious. All of our bills were under $10!  I also give props to the woman working the front of the house. She takes orders, serves and buses the tables. She was very prompt with service and very friendly.  The only downfall for me is that I can only make it here on Saturdays to eat. Although, it might be best that I don't live or work closer because I could see myself eating here everyday."}
{"text":"You will NOT be disappointed. I had been in Ohio visiting my parents for a few days and wanted a local taste before getting on the plane to head back to Dallas. The food was amazing! I had the Warsaw combo. My favorite item on the Warsaw was the Hinters Stew. My mom had a pierogi plate and my dad had stuffed cabbage. My dad said it was the best stuff cabbage he had ever had. The juice of the stuffed cabbage was very flavorful. I can't wait to come back to town and eat here again!"}
{"text":"This place is a quaint little diner with simple home style polish food. Some of the sides are canned but for the price it's a good fit. The pierogi are on the small side but good with saut√©ed onions. The polish dishes are authentic and portion size is good. This is a Parma gem! Polish food is peasant food. Nothing fancy or elaborate. Keep it simple, keep the place clean, serve it hot. They do this well."}
{"text":"My friend and I had a craving for pierogies and ended up here after a reading a few recommendations. Nothing fancy and only a few tables but the food it authentic and absolutely delicious. We tried a variety of their pierogies including sauerkraut, potato and mushroom. The potato and cheese were my favorite. We also split a plate of their Saturday special: Chicken paprikash! It was almost as good as my moms!  Splitting a single serving of paprikash was more than enough for both of us however I was a little surprised to see a charge for a 'sharing plate' on the bill.  This place serves up the perfect polish comfort food but the establishment. However if you care not a fan of 'cozy' diners you might want to opt for takeout. I know that I will defiantly be back."}
{"text":"If you havent stopped  by this place you need to put on your must do list ! Food is fresh cooked daily specials everything I've ever had from there is amazing ! Love this small treasure  ."}
{"text":"Solid polska food.  -dinky little location, but i kind of dig that. -i got the tour of Poland ($12?) -everything was great (cept the canned green beans)"}
{"text":"As everyone has stated, tiny place but delicious food!!  Hubby and I both LOVED the perogies!!  The cucumber salad was quite tasty too.  Service was friendly. Price was just right..highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Pierogies? Fried fish? Done and done; authentic polish food, from a down home type kitchen. Treat yourself to something worth trying!"}
{"text":"The best pirogies! Omg!!! Was craving some for a while but really wanted authentic tasting ones. When growing up in high school my best friend was Polish and her mother would make them and my god were they good even some stuffed with blueberries and sour cream on the side was amazing but I will say this is as close as it gets to authentic!! Small place nothing fancy but clean and friendly! I will definitely go again when I'm in the mood for pirogies. And the potato pancakes are sooo yummy. Definitely recommend it and it's right in the heart of Parma and quick service!"}
{"text":"I got the taste of Poland and it was delicious. The stuffed cabbage just melts in your mouth. I can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"This place is little. I'm glad we got here on an off time. The perogies were good and the blintz was great. It was a little stuffy and I wish they would have opened the door to get some air flow."}
{"text":"I love this little hole-in-the-wall place! I had the pirogies, potato pancakes and the cucumber salad, all very good! My boyfriend had the paprikash and it too was to die for. The only reason I'm knocking off a star is because as the name states, it's definitely a \"little\" place. Not very much seating, but the food is amazing. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Great (very!) little place with very authentic Polish food.  The menu has all the Polish favorites-- kielbasa, potato pancakes, pierogis, sauerkraut, stuffed cabbage.  There are lots of lunch items and many a la carte items.  There are also plenty of full dinner meals that are served all day.  The menu also includes some non Polish food like grilled cheese sandwiches if someone doesn't want Polish food...but you will be missing out on some great food!  I had pierogis and sauerkraut and my husband had the Tour of Poland which included kielbasa, stuffed cabbage, pierogis and sauerkraut. We both loved our meals!  The waitress was very friendly but the restaurant was a little time worn. We are looking forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"Adorable, authentic & awesome! This is a hidden treasure in Parma. Do you wish you could sit at your  grandma's table and enjoy pierogi? Stop in at the Little Polish Diner and you will take a step back in time. Everything is made by hand and to order. Every dish we ordered was delicious. I'm so happy to have found this eatery. It might be tiny, but it's terrific!"}
{"text":"We are not talking about the day you went to the funeral. We are talking about  the last 2 times  (friday) that we have come to your diner. Fourth of July weekend we we arrived at the diner at 6.15. Lights on girl sweeping floor. We were standing at the door and a lady pulled up on her bike she had rode from Lakewood to meet some friends for dinner only to find the door locked.  July 15 we made sure to arrive at 6.30 your sign says you are open til 8 on Friday. But we didn't want to feel rushed. We were told the cook was sick but we could get an order to go.  So yes we do understand people have funerals to attend."}
{"text":"Excellent food and friendly staff.  Kielbasa, sauerkraut, pierogis, and cabbage rolls rounded out our dinner and no one went away hungry. Comfort food for sure, homemade and authentic.  A must try for Polish food lovers. Make sure you check hours before you go.  We went at about 4 and had our choice of seats but it fills up quickly as the dinner hour approached."}
{"text":"Home style Polish food in a charmingly un-artsy setting. They serve the classics here, and the pierogi were perhaps the best I've ever had. I like the options available to the diner also; you can order the combos that they've put together on the menu or go a la carte, which is what we did. Two stuffed cabbage is too much for me, but one was perfect with my pierogi quintet and delicious cucumber salad with sour cream and dill. Sometimes I crave this comfort food, and I'll be back for more."}
{"text":"I love this place for authentic Polish food. It's tiny and you may have to wait for a table but it's well worth the wait. The sweet cheese pierogi take me back to my childhood. So glad our daughter is now in Parma because we can stop in when we visit."}
{"text":"It's not every day you find a Polish restaurant.  This small place has the perfect charm you'd expect.  Home cooked cabbage rolls were perfect.  So happy we got off the beaten path to find this."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with my mom after reading the menu online. I was sad when I learned that the chicken paprikash isn't served daily. Also, I was a little disappointed in how many non-Polish offerings they had. The inside is cute and very tiny! It had a nice homey feeling to it.  My mom ordered the stuffed cabbage and it tasted good, but it had the texture of having been microwaved very quickly. My piergois looked sauted and delicious, but had very little flavor. I was bummed out. I'll try it again, maybe at a more traditional meal time. It wasn't bad, it was good, but not as flavorful as I was expecting."}
{"text":"Truly a hole in the wall place! It is small but a nice place for a polish meal!   When I went I tried the stuff cabbage. I am picky about my stuff cabbage but really enjoyed theirs. The inside meat filling was light! It was not heavy. It was light and tender. I was very impressed.   I would gladly go back."}
{"text":"Since I'm Polish, I avoid Polish restaurants. Who can compete with Mom's old style cooking?  Sorry, Mom. This place can.   I'm really picky about my beef, can't stand fatty meats. I ordered the beef goulash because the waitress assured me it was lean.  Not disappointed. The dish was brought to me and the aroma reminded me of my mom's kitchen.   The meat was full flavored and the sauce was spectacular.   It came with potato dumplings. Delish. Yearning for more just writing about it.   Some reviews complained about the price. You can get cheaper elsewhere but it's gonna taste like prison or dog food.   People gotta make a living and pay for overhead.   I'm gonna have to find reasons to visit Parma more often."}
{"text":"Definitely worth the drive! This little diner was spot on authentic and the portions were generous. Cozy and welcoming atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love. We went today and the tour of Poland. Everything was absolutely perfect. I am trying to find a reason to head back to parma soon."}
{"text":"Tour of Poland, almost exactly like we make at home....  Kielbasa and kraut, excellent, the kielbasa was even sliced in half and fried the way my dad does it.  Pierogies, quite good, although I would like to have the ability to substitute the kinds of fillings I order on the Tour of Poland, potato isn't my favorite.  The cabbage rolls were huge, not like the way my family does them (ours are much smaller) but very tasty indeed.  Service was great, kind of made us feel like we were eating at a friend's place.  Saw the chicken paprikash on the specials board, I will have to come back on a Saturday to give that a try!  Not quite sure what was up with the blowfish hanging from the ceiling, but I was ok to go with it because the food was SOOOO good!"}
{"text":"Went here a couple months ago with my girlfriend.  I got the tour of Poland she got the stuffed cabbage. I ordered some extra pierogis. The portions are small! They don't put any sauce on their stuff cabbage and pierogis were very small! Mrs. Tees from the grocery store are twice as big! Needless to say Even after ordering 6 extra pierogis I was still hungry. So if your not very hungry and don't mind paying the premium  for a  for just a small amount of food eat here!"}
{"text":"Little place, little pierogies, big taste.  Happened upon this place while garage sale hunting with mom in Parma. Mom had been here before and really liked it. As usual, mom was right ;)  The dining room is tiny, only about 8 tables. The decor is well.... let's just say Polish people aren't exactly known for their fashion sense. I can say this because I'm Polish ;)  Very quaint though, including Polish folk art on the wall.   I ordered the Polish Boy which normally comes with fries, but for an extra $1.75, you can sub 3 pierogies. I was all about that. The sandwich was simple with smoked kielbasa and sauerkraut, but great tasting. I threw a little sour cream on it for I put sour cream on everything. The sausage was nice and smoky and had great \"snap\". The little 3-bite pierogies were equally great.  I opted for the potato cheese. The dough was nice and light and the filling was exceptionally tasty. They contained more cheese than most I have had...and I've had a lot. The potato tasted good too, not reconstituted like some.   There are daily specials like pot roast and chicken paprikash. I'll definitely have to come back for the chicken!"}
{"text":"This place is the real deal. Great authentic polish food and very good service. The pierogis are home made and some of the best I have tasted. The kraut and kielbasa is phenomenal. If you enjoy ethnic food at all, do yourself a favor and try this place!"}
{"text":"Delicious. Pigs in a blanket are the best I have ever had. Pierogi's are awesome!"}
{"text":"Last minute decision to stop here but have been wanting to try it! I was pretty satisfied overall. The food was tasty and service was nice and quick! I had the pork chop dinner. The pork chops tasted good but we're just a smidge on the chewy side; however, not enough to deter me from getting them again in the future. Growing up my best friend was from Poland so I had my fair share of homemade polish dishes and there has yet to be a person to top his mom's pork chops! So I have high standards for pork chops ;) the green beans and mashed potatoes were average, potatoes definitely improved when I put the gravy on them. I ordered a side of pierogies and I was very pleased. It seems they mix the potato and cheese together so you get both in every bite! I had spots to pancake which was good but I've definitely had better .. Not one for rumors but I've been told there potato pancakes are store bought. Shame shame if true!   When I return I must try the cabbage rolls and another dinner, I just don't know which! If you're in the area and in the mood for polish food I would recommend!"}
{"text":"Very good! Love their cabbage and noodles. Fish fry is to die for!!!! Would defiantly recommend this to a friend! :)"}
{"text":"This is definitely a place to visit if you're craving pierogis and stuffed cabbage! They have 5 flavors of pierogi (potato, potato and cheddar, sauerkraut, sauerkraut and mushroom, and sweet cheese). As a bonus, you can mix and match the pierogis in your entr√©e or as your side, allowing you to sample the different flavors. The sauerkraut is also tasty, served warm, slightly sweet, and not too pungent. It's definitely a small spot, but we were seated promptly, and our drinks were kept full the whole evening. Plus, before the meal, they brought us a plate of soft, sweet wheat rolls with plenty of butter. For under $12 each, we all left satisfied!"}
{"text":"If you want great polish comfort deliciousness...GET HERE NOW! We had the assorted pierogi and one was better than the next. Sauteed in butter and onions like it's supposed to be, it was heaven on a plate. We also had the saturday special, the chicken paprikash and it couldn't have been any better than this. We had wonderful service and I loved that this neighborhood gem had a new customer every 5 minutes picking up orders to go. They were very busy for a good reason. The place is not fancy but it doesn't need to be, the food is wonderful."}
{"text":"Located in Polish Village in Parma (not to be confused with Ukrainian Village a few streets over) this is a teeny tiny place with very good food. The decor is a cross between diner kitsch and crazy aunt.  I was able to satisfy my stuffed cabbage craving. The pierogies are quite good as well. Canned pop kind of threw me off, but oh well. I have to agree with other reviews that pointed out that the side dish vegetables are canned.   But really, if you are coming for Polish food, do you really want a common vegetable? Substitute!  Will definitely be back and guessing frequently."}
{"text":"Tiny diner in Parma specializing in Polish comfort food deliciousness. The mini pierogi are wonderful, chewy dough with heavenly potato and cheese filling and buttery onions. They do have other fillings available, but potato and cheese are the only type I'll eat at this point. Why mess with success? Polish boy sandwich had nicely smoked sausage and mild kraut on a pedestrian roll. Owner has been there each visit and is personable. Simple and delicious food served by friendly folks is exactly what I want in a diner. Beware: keep your eyes open nearby on Snow Road as takeout has resulted in butter-covered, barehanded pierogi-eating drivers... Or so I'm told."}
{"text":"Apparently I'm Polish and had no idea. I grew up eating cabbage & noodles, stuffed cabbage, and pierogies! The Little Polish Diner is small and nothing fancy by any means, don't expect a ton of flavors, but to me it is quintessential comfort food. It tastes good and fills you up, perfect to eat before taking naps on Sundays.   *Chicken Paprikash $9.99 (on Saturdays only) *Cheese Blintz (optional strawberry topping) $2.75 *Cabbage and Noodles $3-$4? *Cucumber Salad $1.95 *Sweet Cheese, Sauerkraut, Potato-Cheddar Pierogies meal $7.75 *Tour of Poland (Sausage & Kraut, Stuffed Cabbage, 2 Pierogies, Green Beans, Roll) $11.25 *Pyzy (meat stuffed dumplings) meal $9.25  The pierogies are on the smaller side, but they are served with buttery fried onions and a side of sour cream, mmm tasty. The cucumber salad is refreshing and perfectly accompanies the carb loaded meals. Chicken Paprikash is one of my favorite dishes and they do it right here! Everything is simple, but made well, you can definitely imagine your grandma in the kitchen. I will be stopping here again!  Just note that the $2 off Yelp check in offer is no longer being recognized. This needs to be removed from Yelp."}
{"text":"Very small place but food is excellent. The stuffed cabbage reminded me of my dads as I was growing up. Good size portions, couldn't finish my 2 cabbage rolls. Cheese blintz great way to finish. Recommend highly."}
{"text":"Friendly people, great food, best sauerkraut and perogies in cleveland. A very low cost. One of my favorite places to eat in ohio, the only downside  is that its a verry small and can get buisy."}
{"text":"So you can pretty much ignore the posted hours as if they are slow they close when they want to. Food was good not great nowhere near the quality of Sokolowskis but if you're in the area and have a hankering then its worth a drop in."}
{"text":"This place is fabulous!!!  The pierogis were wonderful and the stuffed cabbage was tender and delicious.  I can't wait to try the pork chops next time!!!"}
{"text":"Party of three - FOOD WAS AWESOME.  Waitress was friendly and attentive without bothering us.  Good prices and portions.  CAN NOT GO WRONG WITH THIS DINNER!!!!!!  Would eat there every week if it wasn't over an hour drive for us.  CLOSED SUNDAY & MONDAY.  Certain foods only prepared on certain days.  Call ahead."}
{"text":"Another whole in the wall with awesome food for a tiny amount of $$$$$. Great service, and I believe the waitress was also the cook, as she disappeared after taking order and reappeared with the food. Pierogi' were awesome, potato pancakes very good. I love coming back home to Cleveland for food like this, you just can not find it in California."}
{"text":"A great little place.  Honest to goodness quality food.  Small diner, not good for larger groups."}
{"text":"GREAT food, just like Grandma made!! They really do need to move to a slightly bigger location though. Great Food, the people are nice, my son thinks the chicken soup is heavenly. Everything I have had there has been delicious."}
{"text":"They weren't kidding when they named it \" Little\"! 3 four top tables and 2 two tops and a counter. It was clean, welcoming and homey. I had never tried sauerkraut pierogi but I tried the sauerkraut and mushroom. Outstanding!! The pierogi while small in size are large in flavor! The waitress was attentive and patient , perfect for first time visitor! I will be back and if no seating is available, I'll take a to go order!!"}
{"text":"Overall, friendly and nice. Food was average but filling. Had the tuna melt which was creamy, but a little too much mayo. Expected more \"home-made\" looking potato pancakes but they had a good taste. Was a little more expensive then I was expecting with all the up-charges."}
{"text":"Great food. Friendly. Homey, comfort food includes Stuffed cabbage, variety of pierogi (plain, cheddar, sweet cheese, sauerkraut, and mushroom-sauerkraut fillings), excellent potato pancakes, blintzes, kielbasa, burgers, sandwiches, fish, meatloaf, shrimp on menu.   Takeout prepared dishes and fresh, homemade pierogi available in bulk for takeaway.   This location appears to be beloved by locals."}
{"text":"Not sure what the hype is all about!!!  I ordered the Tour of Poland - the pierogis were small with burnt onion pieces and hard, the kielbasa was cut to make bite size piece but still whole and was dried out and hard to eat, the cabbage had no sauce on it and was dried out.  My mom ordered the cucumber salad, potato pancakes and kielbasa and sauerkraut sandwich asking for the kraut on the side.  The sandwich came with the kraut on it and the bun was soggy and mushy from it.  It was us and another couple so it wasn't like the waitress was overwhelmed and forgot.  Her kielbasa was flavorless and tough.  She said she would rather eat Eckridge Kielbasa than the one she was served here.  She asked for the pancakes to be extra crispy and they came out so hard that she could not cut them with the butter knives provided, she had to tear them apart with her hands.  None of the food had any flavor to it, everything was bland and unappealing.  My mom asked for mustard and the girl had to take it from the other customer because they only have one bottle for the whole place (her words).  I asked for a piece of lemon cake to go and we watched the girl open a lemon bunt cake from the grocery store and cut a piece.  For $3.10 I could have bought a whole cake from the same store. There are awards all over the walls, but they are now either riding the coat tails of those awards or they have changed hands - whatever the reason is it is obvious that they don't care about the integrity of the food. WILL NEVER GO BACK OR RECOMMEND. The only reason it got one star is because you have to rate it to leave a review.  If it was my choice there would be no stars for this place."}
{"text":"This was just like sitting in grandma's kitchen, waiting for some bone sticking, good quality food. Perogies, paprikash, stuffed cabbage, meatloaf!  We went all out for our first visit, and I have no regrets. The seating is a little tough during peak hours. But everyone was nice about waiting like sardines for the food. Power of tasty food, am I right??   If this is your first visit, I would say the sauerkraut and mushroom pierogies are a must. I mean try them all of course, but these were my favorite!!"}
{"text":"Want some of the best pierogi you'll ever have?  Look no farther.  Light, perfect pillows of Polish goodness draped in a perfect amount of sauce.  This little place is just terrific.  I had kielbasa with sauerkraut and tried three of their great pierogi.  I liked the sausage as well as the sauerkraut.  Both were very good.  The prices are awesome and the hospitality is warm and friendly.  I would definitely come back if I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"This experience had me thinking ? Am I polak ? What defines a polak or a Polish-American ? I know the food more than the language.... Philosophical waxing out of the way for now [I'll wax on yelp later]. This place is okay if you're looking for some 'Polish' cooking.   What bothered me about the menu was that it's more Americanized than I anticipated than for a Little Polish Diner (maybe that's what they name by a Little Polish ? ' Hi-ho!)   The place itself is tiny, seating no more with 30 with 105.7, oldies in the background.  The menu is small which I don't mind. Daily specials, Thursday was beef day, with beef stew for $9.50. Saturday is Chicken Day. I opted for a Polish Boy, for $6.50. It wasn't bad. It was kielbasa and saukerkraut (sour, salty, not the sweet kind) on a hoagie bun. I would have liked to have onions or a sauce on it, but shame on me for not asking. On the plus side, the kielbasa was not fatty and tasted authentic in that it was probably from Krakow Foods (across the street) or a butcher @ the WSM, tasted exactly the same as I've had all my life. This is niggling, but why serve French Fries with the kielbasa ?! How about dumplings ? The   As a side, I also ordered a blintz for $2. Dashed with powdered sugar, filled with slightly sweet cheese, and optional canned strawberry sauce [what, no figs or prunes ?!] My dad, who I also had some of the tour of Poland which gives a good amount of the Polish highlights to sample for $10.95, enough for a full meal. The stuffed cabbage had rice in it and very little sauce. The cumcumber salad, my dad ordered it, and it was the size of a tartar sauce container from a church fish fry ! Though it's only 1.75, but how about a little more than that..  In the end, the food exactly how my mom, [2nd-gen if you care] makes polish food. Not necessarily a compliment but not snark either. Not very useful all of you, probably. I sort of felt cheated in that, I could have had it at home for cheaper."}
{"text":"Great and very small diner! We had the special, fried pork chops and the Tour of Poland. Not light fare so come hungry! Missed out on the potato pancakes, they weren't on the menu and weren't on the main part of the specials whiteboard. Only complaint would be the store bought rolls and canned green beans."}
{"text":"No bad. IMO not cheap( 10.75 for pork goulash over dumplings, about same for most meals) The goulash was the special and cold in some places, warm in some and hot in some with a curdled gravy. It tasted ok, actually pretty good , just off putting that it was spilled all over the bowl and plate and looked curdled, like if you boil something with sour cream in it.  Guessing it was made earlier and reheated in a micro.  The potato dumplings were yummy. Husband had 2 nice looking pork chops with canned or frozen green beans and what the waitress admitted were not real mashed potatoes. They had a number of carry outs for pierogies, maybe the special wasn't the right thing to order.  I just wish they went the extra mile and made real potatoes ( cabbage rolls and fake mashed potatoes = sacrilege) and hadn't curdled the gravy"}
{"text":"Friday night, the wife had dinner with her co-workers, which left me with the kids for dinner.  I asked my daughter what she wanted for dinner, and she replied, \"Perogies!\"  I said, \"Okay, get your shoes on, we're going for a walk.\"  This perplexed my daughter all the way to the Little Polish Diner.  I called ahead and ordered some potato and cheese perogies and french fries for the kids.  I ordered myself some mushroom & sauerkraut perogies with a side of cole slaw.    About 20 minutes later, we walked in the front door and the smell of yummy food made me smile.  This place is just as tiny as I remember and there were a few people sitting and eating already, so it's a good thing we ordered to go.  Our perogies were ready so we paid and walked back home.  My kids loved their perogies and fries.  I tasted theirs and I concurred.  Then i tried my own sauerkraut and shroom perogies and they were also very tasty.  My cole slaw was really good too.  The perogies were larger than I remember, but delicious nonetheless.  I'd like to try some of their other dishes on future visits though.  I've been living in the Polish Village in Parma for 33 years.  It's about time I get my perogie on more often!    Recommend!"}
{"text":"Wonderful little Polish diner.  Everything they have is great.  I go here everytime I visit Parma.  I live in Columbus."}
{"text":"I stopped in here with my fiancee as we are looking to move to the area and wanted to try out a local restaurant. There was enough parking and we parked around back and walked to the entrance in front. The restaurant itself is very small, but warm and welcoming. Our server took our drink orders right away. We discovered they ran out of meatloaf so much for trying that. Maybe next time. The cabbage rolls were good. The sausage and sauerkraut was very tasty.  The pierogi was ok. We ordered a side of cabbage and noodles and it was really good. Seasoned right and I could of made a meal out of that only.  We will definitely come back here when we are in the neighborhood"}
{"text":"The place is small but nicely decorated and clean. The food is wonderful. Most of it home made. Their fish was incredible!  Oh, and of course they have good perigees and such."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend on a snowy Saturday in February. I had the Tour of Poland combo plate that featured the most popular of Polish dishes on one plate: golabki, kielbasa (smoked) and pierogies with farmer's cheese. The dinner included a small dinner roll and a side of green beans. I wish they had fresh Polish sausage. I guess the smoked is imported from Chicago. If you want something quick with no hassle and no stupid long cafeteria line to wait in, go to The Little Polish Diner! The service was excellent and genuine. I love being around my fellow Polish people. Most of the time Polish people are cool. This time was no exception."}
{"text":"Delicious and authentic! My coworkers and I go here regularly and it's always good!"}
{"text":"Little Polish Diner = lunch at your surrogate Polish grandmother's. It's not the most gourmet food (yes-they used canned green beans and rolls from the supermarket), but that's exactly how my grandmother would have done it. The pierogies have a good flavor and are cooked in a pool of onions, butter, and oil. I'd highly recommend the potato-cheddar and sweet cheese; the plain potato variety were missing the \"wow\" factor. They have much more than pierogies; they have potato pancakes, blintzes, kielbasa, and stuffed cabbage as well. On Saturdays, they serve chicken paprikash, and it is a hefty portion of creamy chicken love. The place is small and homey, filled with your typical church crowd on the weekends. You won't have time to feel claustrophobic because the service is quick. If you want to know what it's like growing up Polish in Parma, go here!"}
{"text":"Tiny little, clean place.....3 tables of 4. 2 tables of 2 and a counter with 6 seats. Cabbage & noodles were tasty. Wish there was some bacon or some meat in it though. Stuffed cabbage was some of the best I've ever had. Potatoes were dry and ice cream scoop shaped. Canned green beans. My Dad reports the perch dinner was the best he's had in a long time!! Kudos on that. Food was tasty. Seemed a lil pricey but hey it was worth it!!! I'll totally be back"}
{"text":"Went here because of the great reviews. Don't really know what all the fuss is about. I must admit the service was great a nice friendly waitress. I had the Tour of Poland, my wife the cabbage rolls. Both dinners were more than an adequate portion. To get to the nitty gritty the  kielbasa was the worst I ever had. Hillshire Farm tasted better. The cabbage roll, although large and meaty, lacked any sort of flavor... totally bland. My wife's mash potatoes tasted like they came out of a box. Perogies...you want perogies? Go right across the street to Ridgewood Inn and order their's. Guaranteed you won't get them again at the Little Polish Diner.  This is usually the kind of place right up my alley. Not this time."}
{"text":"Excellent and reasonably priced Polish food.  The Tour of Poland is almost enough for two people.  The cabbage rolls are almost as big as my head.  The only thing that was bad is we would have loved a Polish beer with our meal, but they don't have a liquor license."}
{"text":"The cabbage rolls are really good & kielbasa was nice and smokey. Friendly staff and quick service. :)"}
{"text":"Overall food ranged from so so (paprikash)  to very good (perogie and stuffed cabbage). Mushroom and sauerkraut was a great combo for the perogie choice.  Skip the canned green beans and cucumber salad.   Yikes - flies we encountered - several.  Inside is small and cozy with just 5 tables. Looks like all furnishings and decorations, including carpet are original. Pretty warn looking but diners are not usually fancy. Hubby's review based on paprikash - one and done...says we will not be back  p.s. Don't bother checking in as they will not accept your Yelp check in offer.  Told they don't work with Yelp anymore."}
{"text":"Little is a true description, but they're obviously busy because it was packed during lunch. Very good food! Pirogies were so yummy!!! Will definitely return for this, they had good variety and deals! Chicken paprikash was savory but a little bland. They aren't working with yelp anymore for that discount tho"}
