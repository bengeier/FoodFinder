{"text":"This place has the best pho I ever had since I come to Toronto. It was recommended by a friend, who is a food guru. 

What I like:

-The broth: I find that most of pho broth are bit too salty. after I had my pho I need to drink lots of water. However, this place's broth has the right amount of taste. Plus, broth is the key to a good pho, or vermicelli soup. 

-The garnish: (or whatever you'd call them) this is the only place that I have been so far that offers mint and cabbage for the pho! I love putting mint into the soup, it gives an extra flavor to the soup. 

-The cleanness: the place is not that big, but it looks clean. The place went through a renovation and it looks so much brighter and cleaner. I specially like the way how the waitress put the chopsticks and the spoons into a bottle of hot water. 

I personally like the following dishes:
- Spring rolls (very very crispy_
-fried butter chicken wings (Juicy, and butterly tasty)
-vietnam style pancake 

What's else:

-You can't really comment on the service, you know why, 
- I don't like the fact that there are tables right besides the washroom (this is just personal preference).
-It has 4 sizes for pho.
-The noodle. I know from a Vietnamese friend, that the noodle for the pho should be wide, not thin. The only place that I know that offers noodle similar to those that serve in Vietnam  is pho xe lua (in chinatown)."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Vietnamese restaurant in T.O. The food is always good and the service is friendly. The other factor that makes this Vietnamese restaurant unique in Toronto is that it is actually owned and operated by Vietnamese!"}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times before.  Food is alright - not the best but still good.  I had the house special dry noodle (H01 I believe) and it was a lot smaller than I thought it would be considering that it was $8.  The shrimp pancake was super greasy and oil just oozed out in every bite.

My boyfriend got the house special pho (P01) and there was a lot more noodle than meat.  Broth was ok, not authentic to the vietnamese style though.

I finished my meal before he did and they cleared up my bowl pretty quick BUT they also took away the bean sprout plate that came with my boyfriend's pho - not sure why?

We also ordered a taro bubble tea slush.  It wasn't as slushy as other places, more watery if anything.  Tapioca was fresh and they added a lot of ice cubes in the cup to make it look full.  You don't realize how much ice they put in it until you've finished your drink (which could be in 5 minutes).

Washrooms are small, a little dirty, and cold but you can tell they tried to clean it."}
{"text":"First off, the driver overcharged my order to ensure he had a tip and thinking it was a mistake by the restaurant I felt sorry for him and gave him a tip. In checking the receipt and that he had just left I realized what had happened. I had also asked for all vegetarian dishes and one of them came in with beef and the rest of the order was just disappointing. I will never order from this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Just a casual afternoon out with my family, we decided to come to this place for some tasty Vietnamese food! I ordered a small pho and it was decent but wasn't the best pho I've ever had. They put to much noddles and it was to salty. The avocado milkshake is a must have, since they use fresh avocados! However,the service her was not amazing nor bad. There were only two people out in front to take care of the whole front! Twice I requested some spoons and both times they forgot to bring it to me. The service is really slow here so if you quick service this is not the place for you."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this unpretentious place while driving through nowhere. Probably an old burger joint converted to a Viet restaurant resulting in an odd decor but a familiar restaurant experience.

We ordered three dishes between the two of us, probably too much food. My grilled chicken on vermicelli dish was very tasty. The barbequed meat was dark, nicely flavored, and the dish wasn't excessively filled with noodles either. My friend ordered beef wrapped in betel leaves and he enjoyed it as well. We got an order of pancake and it was this fabulous looking thing (see my pics) stuffed with bean sprouts and bit of shrimp and pork. The dish had generous amounts of basil and mint which I really love about Vietnamese food.

No frills service and minimalist ambience but tasty food nonetheless!"}
{"text":"There is very little  to eat in this hood that isn't fast food-y and frankly, I could eat pho everyday. I haven't branched out past the spring rolls and rare beef pho but they are both delightful. I have both eaten in and gotten it to go - in the time it takes me to walk over there (6-7 mins) it's waiting for me and since I have ordered the same thing each time (the three times I have asked for it to go as opposed to eating in) they know I want extra hot sauce and paying attention like that is a good indicator of how conscientious they are with the menu/ingredients etc. I say high fives all around."}
{"text":"I went there and I ordered a large rare beef to go came hone and I had 3 pieces of meat and almost no been sprouts I was pissed I called and complaining because obviously I was hungry and I wanted more than three pieces of meat she said oh well the chef put the same amount of meat for all of them so I got even more mad nice excuse me I paid for a large you're telling me that they put the same amount and regardless of the size so why would I be paying for a large and getting a small you're ripping people off she wouldn't do anything for me saying I'm not in control I can't do anything next time I'll just give you more meat I want it was so mad Plus to make matters worse my boyfriend went and walked into the kitchen and it was filthy there was literally a bowl of meat sitting on the floor it was disgusting boy caught it I swear to God I will never ever ever ever again it is disgusting and they are rude and they rip you off I wish I could knew how to delete my old review"}
{"text":"The athmosphere is set by relaxing Asian music; simple and traditional service and decor.
Loved the tasty chicken and shrimp Pad Thai, and Vietnamese spring rolls...
But above all, dining here really feels like traveling...!"}
{"text":"Probably the best pho Ive ever had, it was delicious. Staff was friendly and gave us napkins. Definitely will be coming back...soon."}
{"text":"Four of us had lunch there and it was awful. The vegetarian menus had meat in it and my vegetarian lunch had meat sauce in it. It makes me sick just thinking about it. The tea cups smelt like bleach. Over all a terrible experience"}
{"text":"I ordered pancake (banh xeo) today, and you can see what I received. It looks like the messy food which is not pancake. I'm so upsetting and never comeback this place again."}
{"text":"A decent place to dine-in. I went in with some office colleges for lunch. Plenty of seating, the server was very friendly, food came out in a a little slow but was hot! The server did apologized for the delay in food. 

Pricing was friendly on the pocket. I ordered the Tom Xao Sot Tay Xi (Stir Fried Shrimp with Black Bean), which was quite tasty and the Bean sauce went well with the Shrimp and vegetables. The portion size was perfect and the dish had little kick to it which was nice. 

Overall the food was good, restaurant & tables were clean . Parking is not a problem as its part of a plaza."}
{"text":"I've had pho here a few times, it's mediocre. They have gotten orders wrong so many times. This is the last time I will be coming here because they have terrible service and they served me a water downed version of the passion fruit juice. This was the only reason to come, it wasn't even filled to the top anymore. The lady in charge is rude and clearly doesn't care for recurring business. Don't waste your time on terrible service. As soon as we sat down she got mad because we told her we would only be needing drinks. She got our order wrong, didn't fix her mistake. And my passion fruit juice was watered down. Not to mention that we waited over half an hour for three drinks. I'm done with this place."}
{"text":"I have been to many Vietnamese restaurants and this place, unfortunately, is at the very bottom of the list. This includes one place that was closed down for health violations. I was in the area and thought I would pick up dinner (take out) for my family. I ordered 2 orders of rolls, 3 noodle dishes, and 1 order of steamed rice. The service was awful. I got home and the bag contains 1 fork, 1 spoon, 1 moist towelette, and a missing order of steamed rice. The food was less than mediocre. Never going back here again."}
{"text":"Says they deliver and they're open until midnight. But when i called an hour and a half before they close at 10:30 they said they don't deliver passed at a certain time. They just lost $50 and a potential regular."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Didnt even give us water or napkins. They dont even have fucking napkins.

dont come to this trash place"}
{"text":"I had lunch here with my parents recently.  They had been there previously and liked it but my mom was disappointed with our most recent visit.  It was my first visit and I thought it was ok, but not great, and with so many restaurant choices in Toronto, I likely wouldn't come back.

So we sat down and they promptly gave us a pot of tea and 3 tea cups along with the menus.  Unfortunately, one of the cups had a piece of rice or something white and sticky on the rim, so we asked them for another cup.  They took away the cup and brought us another one.  Not exactly an auspicious start, but at least they remedied the situation.  

I got the H02 - House Special Clear Noodle Soup ($8.25).  My parents both got the P01 - House Special Pho.  My mom got a small ($7) and my dad got a large ($9).

I love clear noodles (aka tapioca noodles) and the ones in my soup were ok, but not as chewy as I like them.  My soup was full of miscellaneous items.  I had a quail egg (tasted canned), a wonton (lots of shrimp and pork filling, I wished there was more than just 1), a shrimp (a good size, but not completely de-veined), 2 pieces of squid (tasted rubbery), a piece of BBQ pork (good flavour and not too fatty), 2 pieces of thinly sliced liver (I don't usually like liver, but this was ok), 2 pieces of thinly sliced heart (I gave this to my dad because other than liver I don't eat organ meats), and a fried fish ball sliced in two (tasted good).  The broth was a chicken broth and tasted ok.  It wasn't overly salty or fatty.  The soup also came with a shrimp cake on the side, which is a shrimp still in the shell with the head still on it on a deep fried pancake.  I gave this to my mom because food that still has the head on it freaks me out.  She said the shrimp tasted soft and mushy and not fresh and the pancake was greasy.    

My mom didn't like her pho. She said the noodles tasted sour like it was from an old batch or something.  However, my dad liked his pho and said the broth was delicious and had that true authentic pho taste.  He would return.  My mom and I would not.

Service is not the friendliest but acceptable.  There's lots of free parking in front of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Wow there's a lot of negative reviews but I had a rad time. I had the shrimp spring rolls which were decent, and then had a noodle dish with bubble tea to drink. The tapioca was a bit frozen at the bottom but otherwise it was tasty. My noodles were good but I'd have like if they came with a lime wedge or peanuts. They were missing something that would have taken them from good to great but overall it's decent enough Thai food and I'll probably return to try the pho next time."}
{"text":"It was freakin' freezing and we both wanted some hot soup and immediately thought of Vietnamese Pho. So, we looked for a place close and found this shop.

I had the Pho and my friend had the crunchy noodles. Both were really good!! 
The portions were pretty big and neither of us could finish even though we wanted to.

Great local spot with great food!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I eat Thai quite often. This place was great ! Best Pad Thai we've both had in a long time. My bf enjoyed the rare beef ball pho however said the noodles could have been better. Spring rolls are delicious. Would definitely go back ! And the people who worked there were so kind and smiley :)"}
{"text":"Ordered a crab meat with udon noodle in soup.  It's okay, but nothing special."}
{"text":"Some colleagues and I suggested to go get some Pho for an early lunch. We got there just before 11am and were the only people there. Service was quick and food came quick (obviously). 
Atmosphere: Cute, intimate & fresh. 
Cleanliness: tables, chairs, cutlery & dishes were in good condition.
Constructive criticism: for the servers to have more knowledge on their items they serve. One colleague asked how their item of interest was prepared, and she didn't know. 
Cuisine: Vietnamese 
Facilities: needs a good painting and deep cleaning. Looks grimy.
Food: For appetizers, my colleagues and I ordered the Spring Rolls. There was 4 rolls on this platter. 2 made with grilled pork, and 2 vegetable. The rolls were rather large but the server brought us as scissor to cut in half. This was my second time eating Pho. The portion sizes at this location are large, and the quality of the food is excellent! I ordered The Pho Tai Bo Vien which is Rare Beef & Beef Ball soup. I added two limes and Sriracha hot sauce making this uber tasty. 
Likeliness of returning or recommending to others: I will definitely return. This is a great place for Vegetarians too! I trust their meat quality and freshness of produce. 
Parking: Private
Portion Sizes: filling! my soup was Large. Next time I will order the smaller size serving because I had too much broth left over. 
Price: my Large soup was $9.00. My spring/fresh rolls were $7.50
Service: only 1 waitress working. Asked a few times for drinks and she seemed forgetful. She didn't come once to our table to check or ask if our meals were good or if we needed any beverage refills.
Selection: wide variety. If you don't see it on the menu, just ask. Chefs are flexible."}
{"text":"Great pho restaurant in the area. Soups are delicious although rare times a bit salty/oily. Overall a great menu I have been ordering (sit down and takeout although they do offer delivery) for years. Pad Thai in my opinion is one of the best in the area I absolutely cannot get enough of the sauce. Also as an appetizer try the butter chicken wings they are phenomenal. Fairly clean and friendly service never had a problem. Open until midnight is a good bonus as well."}
{"text":"Wide variety of dishes. Very friendly service. Love Vietnamese food. Best place in the area.  Pretty much the only place in the area that you can eat something healthy."}
{"text":"I've given this location multiple chances to make sure it wasn't a \"one off\" ... But, when ordering. Regular size Pho - I expect more than 4 thin slices of beef!  What a joke.   The bowl was essentially all soup.   My upgrade to egg noodle meant I actually had less noodle than with the standard order rice noodle.  

Plus, the bathrooms are a mess; Never any paper towels.   I give up. Not going back!"}
{"text":"My family of 6 whent for vaction in toronto and ate here. The service was terrible they didn't bring us fish sauce, not enough chop sticks, no knife to cut the pork chops, no waters as we wrote down on the paper and the food had no taste. Only good thing I can say about it is the soup broth tasted okay. Don't recommend this to anyone.  And the washroom are messy"}
{"text":"One star is being generous. We wanted to try their Pad Thai. I ordered the shrimp Pad Thai. We waited for awhile. Then I realized the table beside us, who arrived and ordered 10 minutes after us, had their meals.  As we patiently waited, our food arrived and it was cold. And, try finding a server, they barely checked on us. I heard the Pho is good, but I will not be making the drive over."}
{"text":"Staff here are very nice. I love that they dispense cutlery in a warm glass for sanitation. Their pho is good, but other foods are very questionable. The atmosphere is nice but then also plain and petite."}
{"text":"A slightly more upscale Vietnamese Restaurant located at Jane and Wilson.

SLIGHTLY UPSCALE
The patrons coming in wore $400 pair of jeans, business men in tidy suits, utensils giving to you in boiling hot water (we asian people like to know things are clean), walls were nicely decorated, and it was clean.

FOOD 
The food was nothing special. Same typical vietnamese food.  
I had #19 (seafood and assorted meat egg noodle) on the menu (see picture) since this place is famous for it.  The meat was actually very tasty. I believe it was ox liver? Usually though, i'm not a fan of liver.  The serving was large and I took about 1/2 home. (But then again, I only eat a small for pho)

My friend had #20, seafood egg noodle soup. He really liked it.   They gave us the traditional garnishes such as red hot chili peppers.

COSTS
This place is a tad more expensive than the traditional Pho restaurants.  My meal and my friend's meal each cost $7.25.  I was a bit stunned about the price of the avocado shakes. They were $4 each and they came in such a small cup (took a peek at the neighbours table, so not sure what they tasted like).

SERVER
The food took longer to get to us than at other pho places I've been to. It could perhaps be the they had to fry my little shrimp.  But the server had our menu, tea, and utensils as soon as we sat down.  She took our order quickly too.

The place is pretty good.  But I'm still not sure if the premium prices were completely justified at this Pho restaurant.  But then again, the prices are a lot less than if you were to go to most other type of restaurants so try this one out!"}
{"text":"Noodles were less than average as they were still hard and stuck together by the end of our meal. Seafood noodles didn't have much content, vegetarian spring rolls were good but a little on the expensive side.

Would rather go back to Pho Con Bo around the corner next time."}
{"text":"i've eaten here for years, everything vietnamese on their menu is bang on 
portions are good, service is good this place has character people of all color and all walks of life come here

5/5 stars"}
{"text":"Food was absolutely terrible here, the pork chop dish i had was overcooked and was burnt to the point that it had black crisp all over it. My friend ordered the Shrimp Pad Thai and the server managed to forget her order and we had to wait about forty minutes for them to serve it. Never will i come again to this place."}
{"text":"Came here with a colleague.

Soup was thin and salty, not enough noodles.  So disappointing.  Waste of time.  Waste of money.  Without a doubt the worst pho I have ever had."}
{"text":"Inconsisten. Will not go there for the pho.. only for the  pad Thai. Yummm so  thick with tamarind sauce and sugar..  I always order the  chicken and shrimp  pad Thai. Its spicy savory.. garlicky, moist and comforting. don't forget to order the honeydew bubble tea . Perfect for tempering down the spiciness of the meal.  The egg rolls a perfect loyal companion."}
{"text":"The taste here was horrible. Place seemed dirty. I wouldn't go back here.

The advantage is they open late. And the staff speak English."}
{"text":"The pho was pretty average, lacked the richness and complexity of the broth at other places I've been. The rice dishes were also pretty average and unimpressive. Their rice was relatively dry, but the pork chop was well-seasoned. The fried spring rolls were pretty standard, but had a somewhat unpleasant fryer oil flavour. In the end, it's not bad, but it wasn't great and there are definitely better options nearby."}
{"text":"Good Vietnamese food. Usually order A01. Ch Giò (spring rolls), A14. Hoành Thánh Chiên (deep fried shrimp wontons), R03. Cm Bò (grilled beef with white rice), R16. Cm Chiên Tôm (shrimp fried rice), and P12. Ph Gân, Sách (pho beef tendon and tripe). Also always get a Vietnamese iced coffee at the end!"}
{"text":"Pho gets better the more you eat it but it remains a not very good one, although meat portion sizes are good. Other meals are not fabulous."}
{"text":"Terrible place. I have eaten there a coupe of time and the food at first sight isnt bad until you notice all the bugs in it. The place does not have AC so the pho usually has a lot of nats. This place is gross. After complaining i have gotten another soup with another two bugs floating in it. After taking about 5 bites all together out of both plates the waiter demanded to pay when i got up and told them there was insects there again. Just awful."}
{"text":"Great service and inexpensive. The quality is really there when you consider the price. Will come back.

Great service and inexpensive. The quality is really there when you consider the price. Will come back."}
{"text":"Pretty decent I guess, but nothing super exceptional or anything to write home about. The place is pretty busy every night, which is good considering the area. But I like that they're open till midnight, gives you a late night option. Their menu is pretty wide ranging, and as a vegetarian I like that there are some good options for someone like me. I believe they also have bubble tea and some speciality drinks available. Worth checking out if you're in the area!"}
