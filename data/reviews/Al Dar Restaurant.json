{"text":"Not the best shisha in town. The hookah is Ok, but the atmosphere doesn't sit well at all. It seems that this is an exclusively Lebanese place for people that know each other. Food is pretty decent, but if you dont know the regulars there, then you seem like an odd man out, especially coz the regulars all seem to come in large packs, and talk really loud, and the place itself is fairly small. I'd much rather go to Shahrazad or Habibi nearby, they feel more open and inclusive, and just generally enjoy the vibe there way more."}
{"text":"Part shisha lounge, part Mediterranean/Middle Eastern restaurant, this is a great place to come with a group of friends to enjoy a few hours together.   The smoothies are some of the best in the city (seriously), and the kefta kebabs and fattouche are worth trying as well. I never leave hungry.   Service is pretty on the ball, and the shisha charcoals are always replaced on time whenever they're starting to die out.   Decor is not by any means elegant, but the place has a sort of cozy charm to it, particularly on a crowded evening in the basement."}
{"text":"not a huge fan of shisha but the servers were very nice and even though we asked moved from table to couch back to table, the inconvenience of our requests didn't seem to phase them at all.    I wish they served alcohol...."}
{"text":"Came here tonight with my friend from school for dinner. He's a Muslim and wanted to go here because they were having a Ramadan special for a very attractive price..15 dollars for a glass of fruit juice, soup, salad, and main course. You can't really do much better than that..and of course you can get dessert elsewhere afterwards!   The interior of the place is very very nice with purple couch-benches and comfy chairs to sit on..the main dining area is a bit small but I think there is more seating downstairs (where everyone is smoking hookah) and there may be an upstairs (not sure).   Service was quick (all of the food came quickly) but afterwards was quite inattentive. I had to ask three times for a glass of water. The lentil soup and salad were very tasty and just to let you know, what makes this place even more great apart from the low price is that the portions are pretty damned big for the main course! I had the salmon which was coated and served with LOTS of rice with nuts mixed in. It was very very tasty and I am full.    Overall, this is a great little place..I don't know what they have on other nights (we weren't given a menu or anything and they don't seem to have a website) but I am sure it's good. Since tonight was a holy night for Muslims (my friend and most other people in the restaurant had to wait until 8:22 when the day's fast ended) almost everyone there was there to break the fast with a nice big meal. Hell, some of my friend's friends were there too. What was nice was that the staff were allowing people into the basement so that they had a space to say their evening prayers. Next time, we might come for hookah!"}
