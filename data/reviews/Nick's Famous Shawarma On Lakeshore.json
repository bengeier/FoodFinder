{"text":"It's inexpensive and good. We've gone a few times for chicken Shawarma wrap. Buy 5 get the sixth free. They accommodate us. Mine needs to be mild and my boyfriends needs to be spicy and we're always happy. The only reason it's not 5 stars is that 5he TV is unbearably loud and often the debit machine is broken."}
{"text":"Amazing staff! Incredibly friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"The falafel sandwich tasted pretty good, filled me up and set me back less than five bucks. It's not setting the world on fire but hey, not everything can. And for whatever it was I paid (less than $4.00 actually I think) how can you go wrong?"}
{"text":"Absolute rubbish. A shame as when it first opened it was quite good but the last couple of years it's just terrible. Amazed i tis still open."}
{"text":"I got a shawarma at Nick's this week because the line at \"the other\" shawarma place in the neighbourhood was too long. I was really disappointed. I got take out and only live a minute down the road - when I got there it was cold (literally, I live a minute down the road)."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE. My sister and I ordered from this restaurant because we have tried a different nicks before and loved it.  This location is a disgusting representation Nicks Famous Shawarmas. Not only did the shawarmas have hardly any meat in them, they made us both sick afterwards.... We both got terrible headaches and later puked up everything... I have never eaten a meal that caused a headache before this.  After looking up the restaurant online, it's half a hookah store? Very disturbing.."}
{"text":"Worst shwarma I've ever had. Went in and ordered a beef shwarma (they were all out of beef) so changed my order to chicken and paid for my order. Sat down and when our food was brought to us the worker informed us that the grill was broken so they couldn't grill the shwarma. To me this should have been information given when I ordered so I could have chosen whether I still wanted it or not. I was hungry so decided to eat it anyway. First of all the size of my shwarma was very small compared to other places close by. Second the flavour was bland. Overall I will not be going back here I'll go an extra few blocks to where they can really make a good shwarma and I will be full when I finish."}
{"text":"The food is really good and you the amount you get is enough for 2. We had chicken and beef shawarma dinners. We were served pita and hummus to begin with and were stuffed after that and had to take most of our meals home. The only complaint is too much food. Next time we will order 1 meal to share! I was really happy with my meal. It was quality food and very delicious!   Oh and eat it with the person you are kissing cuz you will have some serious garlic breath...but its good for you.     Thinking about it now I'm craving it...   (The tv was on really loud with a scary movie on that I had to turn my back to)"}
