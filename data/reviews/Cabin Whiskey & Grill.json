{"text":"I have been here three times. The first time the service was very good. The second time the service was mediocre. The third time I was all but ignored. There was no bar rush and very few customers in the service area and yet the woman behind the bar continue to walk past me back-and-forth. I suggest going during the afternoon when no one is there and when you are not in a hurry. I enjoyed the food very much when I got it. Tonight I just walked out"}
{"text":"Llooooonnnggg wait for service,  food was good,  my drink was AMAZING!  I had been eager to try the Cabin for a while now.  We went last night (Wednesday) just before 7pm and it pretty busy.  The wait for a table was short but after being seated for 15 min we still hadn't been acknowledged by a server. As we were walking out the door the owner Payton came after us,  apologized for the wait and said he would take care of us.  We agreed to give it one more try.  A water came right away with some water and took our drink order.    They didn't have a drink menu so I told him I wanted something fruity with vodka and to surprise me.  He brought me an \"around the world\" which is one of the best drinks I've ever had. I give the Cabin 2 stars for that drink alone! We asked the waiter to give us 5 min to decide on our order and during that time if he could find out what was in the drink.  15-20 min later he returned to take our order and had forgotten to find out what in the drink. I asked him to find out if the bartender knew how to make a \"June bug\". Our food came out and he not only finally told me what was in the drink but bought me another. Although I didn't order it I was happy to drink it but I never did get an answer about the June bug. The food was good and portions were nice. The vegetables were cooked perfectly,  tender with just a slight crunch. The beef and chicken skewers were tender and juicy with a delicious sauce on top. Brushetta was good but the bead could have been better. The house mac n cheese was really good. Start to finish we were there for a total of an hour and a half. I would go there again but I might have a snack before going and I definitely would make sure I wasn't on a time constraint."}
{"text":"Went for dinner on Friday night, during happy hour. Was seated immediately as it wasn't all that busy. Service was a bit slow; not very attentive. However, the waitress was quite pleasant. We shared two appetizers and one of the specialty burgers. Food, in general, was very average. Would recommend for a quick happy hour beer, but that's about it."}
{"text":"Great lunch experience!   Spicy salsa w/chips a great starter. Salsa was better than most in the Phoenix area. Entrees: Butterfly Shrimp skewers and Chicken & Shrimp Alfredo were both marvelous.  Service was prompt and efficient.  Will definitely be on my return list."}
{"text":"Food was great.  Service was the worst I've seen in quite some time.  After waiting 10 minutes we asked the hostess if there was a waitress for our area.  No improvement the rest of the evening and I'm a patient customer having waited tables myself in the past.  She just didn't seem to care"}
{"text":"My wife and I just had dinner here, and it was great! I used a Groupon, which was happily accepted with no hassles or crazy stipulations. I had the filet, with mashed potatoes. The portion was very generous, and meat quality was great. I probably should have ordered the sauce on the side, because I am a steak purists, but the flavor was great all the same. My wife had the chicken parmigiana, which was a little unconventional. It was served more like a chicken & pasta bowl, but again, great flavor. We also had the Avacado egg rolls as an appetizer, they were amazing! The staff was friendly and on point. The manager even came out and talked with us, and she was super nice and accommodating. Our server was Makena, and she was great! Our drinks stayed full and we never felt neglected. I'm glad I gave this place a chance, despite some of the poor Yelp reviews. This is a new establishment, and there are always going to be some growing pains. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in Wednesday during happy hour. All appetizers were half off and were excellent. Large portions and delicious. Most of the people at the outdoor bar we're eating appetizers also and love them too. I highly recommend this place for happy hour or dinner."}
{"text":"The worst management ever. Service was okay but my stuffed peppers were cold in the middle, I wasn't too upset because these things happen. They were brought back to the table by a manager with black hair, in plain clothes which were too small for him and he reeked of Marijuana. He was apologetic, with his horrible breath close to my face and he scolded the poor waitress pretty much in front of us. Our martinis were also really bad but we didn't want to our waitress in any more trouble. We will not be going back because of that guy."}
{"text":"Been to the cabin twice now and the first time I went my tab was $30.00 and when the tab cleared in my bank account they charged me $70. After reaching out to the restaurant twice and getting no call back and talking to the GM three different times to get them to check my credit card receipt. Finally after 2 weeks got a call back that they owed me $35 cause they over charged my account. Worst customer service ever and coming from someone who works in the industry as well is saying a lot because I know what it takes to be a bartender, waitress, and manager and they have horrible customer service! Honestly probably the worst I've seen!     I decided to give The Cabin a second shot and went and had brunch with a group of friends. We ordered and it took an hour for our food and appetizers to come out. They left our food in the window waiting to be served for so long that it become cold. So when we received our food it was all cold and waited an hour for. Then my friend found mold floating in her child's cup of apple juice!! Disgusting!! GM came over and all he said was, \" oh sorry, I just got here. I'm sorry.\" And then walked away and then never came back to check on us. When we were done we asked our waiter for the bill and he said it was taken care of but the GM never came back to our table to tell us himself!!  I was shocked to learn that this gentleman was not just a manager but the GM of The Cabin and obviously doesn't know what customer service means! Very disappointed in this restaurant was looking forward to a new restaurant in the area, only to be extremely disappointed and I will not be going back!!!     I would NOT recommend The Cabin at all!!!!"}
{"text":"We always have a great time we are here Friday & Saturday nights bathroom is always clean our beautiful lady always has what we need and more"}
{"text":"Can't believe this place has 4 stars!  It was one of the worst dining experiences ever.  The place was far from full, maybe 25 people total, inside and out.  There were at least 4-5 servers and 2 bartenders outside.  Took 15 min. to get a drink.  Ordered food, 20 min later the appetizers arrive with ONE entree!  NO flatware, napkins, plates etc.....15 minutes later the server apologizes for the cook and offers half off the second entree, which STILL hadn't been brought out!.  Needless to say that entree was cancelled.  Food wise, I had the morrocan chicken which was ok.  The torpedoes were very good.  My thought is, if you open a new restaurant hire experienced servers."}
{"text":"Good food and most fabulous bartender Stephanie who looks remarkably Megan Fox.  Awesome happy hour and reverse happy hour."}
{"text":"I visited Arizona for my first time a week ago with my future wife, Victoria. I'm just now barley posting the review now that I'm back home to boring Bakerfield, CA, but I would like to give a shout out to the bartender Logan who was definitely one of the most friendly bartenders I met on our week vacation. We talked a for a little bit about beers and general life things. He's got a good head on his shoulders and is headed in the right direction. We sat out on the patio and initially took a while for service to get going, which led me to the inside bar where Logan was at, and he took care of me in a jiffy, even helping out to the table with my drink  The food was great, as well as the drinks, thanks again Logan for the amazing time. We will definitely be back to this spot the next time we visit Arizona"}
{"text":"Love this place! Usually sit at the bar, Courtney is awesome, I'm  not much of a whiskey drinker, but the beer selection is great and they are ice cold!  Gotta try the torpedoes. And they make a great bloody mary."}
{"text":"Pro: Large outdoor seating & bar area Con: Uncomfortable metal bar stools; misters came on spurting water all over getting us and everything on the table wet (cell phone, sunglasses, meal); macadamia coconut chicken breast entree was huge disappointment--pounded so thin it was barely there & dry.  Server was pleasant until we mentioned the misters were a problem and the chicken was disappointing. Server was very curt & unfriendly after that. Overall impression: Probably won't return"}
{"text":"Awesome service, great food, Amazing drinks. Definitely found a new Friday night spot."}
{"text":"Usually just get appetizers and drinks.  Service had been good every time.   The environment is nice now that the weather is cooling off. Prices are good."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a great meal before going to a Coyote's game. The bacon wrapped jalapeño torpedoes were fantastic! The Baja burger was cooked perfect and big enough to split. Best of all the service was exceptional.  A very enjoyable experience, we will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Too bad the service is terrible  this seems to be the norm. No staff outside just the bartender."}
{"text":"Came in on Sunday night. The place was empty. Maybe 20-25 people here. Service was slow as well. Ordered a steak medium and it came out closer to well done. Based on how slow the service was I didn't bother returning it. The food is tasty and they have a good selection of things on the menu. They have a massive selection of whiskey and another night I would have tried a few of them. The manager ended up comping my meal even though I insisted on paying for it. Looks as though he is trying to improve things and I hope it works out. I will give this place another try."}
{"text":"The service was horrible. The waitress was not very personable. When I asked for a refill, she put her finger in my glass while reaching across the table. My sister in law said her salad wasn't very tasty. The mac and cheese was really tasty. I don't eat hummus but apparently it needed salt. I went to the ladies room and was grossed out. There was a huge box under the sink filled with used paper towels. You would thinking changing a restaurant from the sandbar to the cabin they would pain the bathroom to make it look nice. They didn't. People are dressed not very professionally.   I mean who wears yoga pants to serve people. Two of the male workers were acting like they were in a karate movie."}
{"text":"Great new restaurant, the service was outstanding, the waiter was very knowledgeable and gave some very good recommendations on their very large menu. The appetizers were great, 1/2 off during Happy Hour and the dinner portions are very generous. We can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"The worst service ever!!!!!!  The waitress was very rude, and took her for ever to get us a glass of water, and when we asked someone else for water, they told us that they could not help us !!!! IT'S A GLASS OF WATER PEOPLE!!!!and on top of things the food  was not even worth it!!! Please do not go to this place! I rather wait an hour in a different place or simply  make a sandwich at home that to go to this place again."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this little gem a few weeks ago and have been by every weekend since!  I was a little concerned the first time we poked our heads in as there were several waitresses at the hostess station, dressed a little too \"Hooter-esque\" for me considering we had kiddos with us - I thought perhaps it wasn't family friendly.  However, we peeked at the menu and it sounded great, so we gave it a try.  The service was absolutely fantastic!  Each visit our waitress has been super attentive without being obtrusive and service has been fast and friendly.  Really nice job!  The feel is a little too woodsy for me on the inside (Camo fabric on booth seats, stuffed animals for decor).  It was awesome to be able to watch sports on their flatscreens though - and haven't hung out on the patio yet but now that the temp is finally coming down after a hot summer...can't wait to be out there.  The patio is big with misters humming along at full speed - super fun looking patio and should make for a wonderful place for a date or girls' night out this fall!  The food has always been fantastic - we have tried Avocado Egg Rolls (a must try if you like avocado - seriously amazing), Wings, a Tuna appetizer dish, and a few other things.  Our food has been out of this world good - the kind of food that will keep us coming back time after time after time. The kids meal has standard kid fare, but they do step it up a notch and I appreciate that!  No \"Easy Mac\" here - kids get the real thing with a delicious homemade mac and cheese.    This is becoming our family's go-to spot when we are out and about on a busy Saturday.  Well done, Cabin - very happy to have you in the West Valley!"}
{"text":"This place is too good! The Hog and Heifer burger is a must try, Gerald was my server during Mother's Day and he treat my family right. Good restaurant to bring the family at during the day, I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Tried this place on Saturday after a movie for lunch. It was dead, very few people. I had been here when it was the Sandbar for drinks a few times, and the remodel the new owners did is just bad. It almost feels like this restaurant is confused at what it is. Tacky decorer (bad camo covered seats and weird pictures randomly placed, with the most uncomfortable looking bar stools), the waitresses dress in hooter like clothing (just all black), reggae music was playing the whole time, but the menu is more upscale food and extremely high priced. The pictures that people have posted will give you a clue.  We had no real issues with service, but it was slow. They also did not inform us before hand that a salad as a side, instead of fries, was a dollar extra (not the biggest deal, but would have been nice to know). We spent the whole time eating talking about the ambiance of this place, it honestly was just that weird. We finally decided it was like eating in a forgotten part of Cabellas where redneck college boys would probably hang out.  We honestly liked the food. We had an interesting appetizer of a new take on poppers, a couple of burgers and the cookie for dessert. But if youre going to charge 9 dollars for 4 poppers, and 13.50 for a burger, then it better be a great experience. It just wasnt. I also would not bring my young kids here, even for lunch. I did not find it family friendly with the decore, music and how expensensive the food was.  We did not have any drinks so I cannot speak to the service, price or quality of their alcohol."}
{"text":"Not to sure how long they have been open, but watch for 4 rent signs. Nobody wants to help you. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great place to unwind on a Friday. Good happy hour 3-7 and the patio is awesome. Food is above average. Service has improved greatly since first opening."}
{"text":"Went last night for the first and last time. We arrived about 6:00 PM. When we finally figured out where the hostess/host stand was we were greeted and able to sit by the \"garage doors\". It was raining but it was nice having the doors open. Given this was our first time there we took a little time to figure out what we would like. This seemed to upset the waitress as she gave unpleasant service to us the rest of the night. We had a couple of questions while placing our order and again this seemed to upset her and even appeared to be confused. We ordered the nachos for the appetizer, we requested that because of some food allergies that all toppings except for the cheese on the side. The appetizer arrived fairly quickly, but sour cream was not \"drizzled\", it smothered the entire too. We were able to eat around the sour cream and in the end we enjoyed them. I ordered the Cabin Cheeseburger and requested that all the \"condiments\" not only be on the burger but on the plate as well. I could immediately tell the waitress did not know what I was talking about, so I then requested that the cheeseburger come plain and to please not put anything like tomato, onion, lettuce even on the plate. Again when the food arrived, a simple request could not be filled. I was extremely disappointed with the cheeseburger. It looked like a pre-made frozen patty and had absolutely no flavor to it at all. The french fries were hot and a little on the crispy side which I enjoy. My partner got the turkey avocado sandwich with fries and he enjoyed it and said it was good. When our bill arrived we found out the appetizers were half off until 6:00, but no one told us, if we had know we would have gotten another one. Since we had a gift card and had unexpected money left over we ordered the apple pie. This was fantastic and worth the 15 minute wait. It is served hot out of the oven with a nice scoop of ice cream. Perfect dessert for two or three people to share. Back to the garage doors, as I said it was raining, but the rain was not coming into where we were seated. One of the owners comes over out of the blue and closes them. When we asked him why, he said I just figured people want them closed because of the rain. We had been there for at least 20 minutes at that point and it had been rain well over an hour at this point. He compromised and left one door slightly open. A few minutes later and someone else comes over and closes that one without asking anyone if they needed it closed. Just as we were finishing our meal, a second owner came over and said he was opening the doors if that was ok. He asked every table seated by the doors. When he came over to our table we explained to him that we asked to sit where we were because the doors were open and we didn't understand why they were closed in the first place. I gave a two start rating mostly because of the attitude of the waitress. Reviews on the food was mostly positive, but how can you screw up a cheeseburger?"}
{"text":"I love this bar!  I have had lunch and happy hour here several times and the food is outstanding ! A very fun bar with great(not bar) food.  I will continue to visit and send friends."}
{"text":"Lackluster service, drinks are overpriced.... We went for the second time tonight, my husband used his debit card. We closed out our tab only to get home to realize that they had charged his card twice for two different amounts. The staff isn't very friendly. If you are a college student and want to party... This is your spot but you will wind up paying too much!!! Let's see if they call me back or I have to go down there..."}
{"text":"If greasy, tasteless food, dirty silverware and bad service are acceptable to you then you will be okay with this place. If not then I would recommend steering clear of this place. Definitely won't be back!"}
{"text":"A friend had told me to check this place out awhile ago and I feel bad I didn't get a chance to come sooner! Came out during a thursday night and had the time of my life! Huge I mean huge crowd!! Alot of people seemed to not like the mass of people but I had no problems surfing the crowd. Drinks were great service was great the music was what I expected for that type of crowd and the dj played a nice set.  All in all very fun place planning on coming back on a Sunday to watch football and eat!"}
{"text":"Went there for Happy Hour on Tuesday.  Chicken Tacos were made with \"canned chicken!\" Ughhh! on a tiny, uncooked flour (?) tortilla for $2 each PLUS 50 cents extra for a very SMALL plastic tub of salsa!  What kind of place charges for salsa when you're serving TACOS??  Also margaritas were VERY WATERED DOWN.  Would rather pay more for a bigger, better margarita!  Best to stick to  a MEXICAN RESTAURANT FOR HAPPY HOUR if you want authentic tacos and margaritas!!!"}
{"text":"Ate buffalo wings and bottom mimosa's compliment of Brandi. Great bartender. Nice patio, great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"We loved Taco Tuesday at The Cabin. Tons of choices and each one was delicious.  Quality of food was enhanced by fantastic service from Leigha. She was effectively attentive and adorable. Great place with great specials."}
{"text":"What a pleasant experience, from dinner to drink at the outside bar. Had a chance to speak with the manager Eric, awesome food, awesome drinks and awesome service. We will be back!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place shocked me. The bad reviews that i have read seem to lack validation.  The staff has been super friendly and a tentative.  Really good happy hour to serve even better food.  Drinks are drinks anywhere you go but I'm definitely coming back for the atmosphere, especially on Thursday.  Thank you Leah and Mia for awesome service!"}
{"text":"Horrible we walked out . The table we were sat at was dirty, the music was so loud we could barely talk to each other . The atmosphere was more like a loud biker bar than a nice restaurant . Didn't like this place at all"}
{"text":"I was really impressed with quality and quantity of the food it was excellent I had the BLT sandwich and fries loaded with apple smoked bacon sandwich was huge the fries were the best I've ever had my husband had the blue cheese burger he loved it.  I would definitely go back to try some other things on the menu.  I took a photo of half of my sandwich I'll try to get it to post"}
{"text":"I definitely recommend this place for a casual lunch/dinner and drinks. Went here for the first time today and had awesome service. The food very good and was brought out to us quickly. The management is great as well."}
{"text":"Had a blast! We were hesitant to come because of some of the poor reviews, but we have tried everything else in the area and wanted something new.  I haven't had this much fun in a long time. The tables were plenty far apart so we felt like we could laugh and talk without being obnoxious to others.  The wait staff was amazing. Shiva was out waitress, and she was great.  Mark, one of the managers  came over to say hi and was very friendly.  The table was cleared often as we tried several drinks.  The Whisky #4 was the favorite,  and if I could give any criticism it would be the drinks tasted a little different each time.   The appetizers were great, and everyone loved their meal.  It is a no brainier that we will be coming back.  And with Happy Hour M-F 4-7 makes it extra worth it!"}
{"text":"Two stars cause the food was good. Went there for an early Valentine's day dinner with my girlfriend. We were sat immediately and the waitress came to take our drink orders promptly, but that was the end of the promptness. Not very long after we were sat, a group of three was sat next to us. No one came to take their drink orders and then when our waitress came with our beers she just walked away. The group of three just up and left saying something to the hostess on the way out. Our waitress was nice although she wasn't very professional and seems like a newbie to the industry. She disappeared a lot, which limited me to only having two beers during the whole stay. Not sure if they were understaffed, but other tables with different waiter/waitress were complaining and the owner was picking up the slack. The owner was seen going up to tables and asking how things were but didn't bother to come up to us in the 2 hours we were there. I really want this place to work cause the building is nice and the food was pretty good other than the pulled pork being a tad bit dry. The draft prices were also a bit high, $6.50 for a pint. They either need a serious staff retrain, more staff, or new staff. I would definitely be back if these things were improved."}
{"text":"First, the bartender here is AMAZING!  She's been so involved with everyone here and so attentive. The kitchen went out of there way to accommodate my weird food request, and the food was IMMACULATE. My experience here was phenomenal and I will absolutely be coming back, over and over again. I haven't experienced service this great in a long time. I'd recommend this place to anyone looking to catch the game and have good food, or Anyone who appreciates quality service and good food."}
{"text":"Not a pleasant experience. Our entrees arrived before the appetizers and were taken back and put under heat lamps while we waited and then ate our appetizers. The crab cake appetizers had no crab , all bread and some flavoring. My $24 T-bone steak was cooked correctly but tough and numerous bites were mostly fat and Gristle.  The garlic butter on the steak was however amazing.  As my side, I ordered the sweet potato fries. When they arrived they were covered in sugar and cinnamon. Being diabetic I cannot eat Sugar. I asked for a replacement side since the menu showed no indication of the sugar. I ordered and received a side salad. During the meal the owner came by and asked how everything was I asked him if he wanted me to tell him the truth you said yes. I explained the numerous problems that we had and he indicated that he would take the cost of the crab cakes off the bill. He apologized for the problems with the meal and said he really wanted to take care of it. He sent over plain sweet potatoes fries , which i did not order and charged me $1.  When the check arrived not only did he not take the cost of the crab cakes off but I was charged $4 for the side salad.  We did receive cards for 2 fee appetizers and took 20% of the cost of my steak (not the bill) but we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Went to a birthday party service was horrible waitress kept forgetting our drinks and when we  would tell her we ordered she would argue with us and tell us we didn't. Food wasn't cooked correctly.  All in all huge disappointment waste of my money"}
{"text":"I had the chicken skewers. They were suggested. Holy mutha f'ing shit balls!!! These things were so good. Definitely recommend. The sauce over them is just the perfect flavor. No idea what it is. But it is good. Fiancé had the pizza salad. This is her absolute favorite. They use to have this at whiskey rose but they got rid of it there. No idea why. She was literally very excited, not figuratively but literally. She wants to come back just to have it again. Hope hey keep it here."}
{"text":"We were on the way to a concert and everywhere we tried on the way was packed.  On a whim we decided to swing by The Cabin to see if we could get a quick drink and some food.  My friend mentioned the bad reviews on Yelp but we were in a bind and in a hurry.  We walked in and grabbed three seats at the bar. Brett was our bartender, he was very nice, provided great service and was attentive.  We ordered the Avocado Egg Rolls, Bruschetta, Cabin Torpedoes, and Korean Soft Taco's all were very good.  I was a bit perplexed as to why they would serve marinara sauce with the bruschetta though.. The Cabin has a great Happy Hour and the prices are good!"}
{"text":"We went on Tuesday. Some of the tacos were good some could have had more flavor. Atmosphere was nice. I'll go back on a night when they aren't doing trivia"}
{"text":"I have to say there was a bit of a hiccup, but the way it was handled was spectacular!  Our order was shorted and the shorted entree made it to our table late.  With no hesitation the manager and waiter brought the entree to the table with apologies and informing us we would no be paying for it.  As well they made a special desert for our daughter that was also on the house!  The food was great and they fixed the issue with the food exceptionally well!!  We will be back!!"}
{"text":"We were really hoping this would be great, but it just didn't happen.  We tried the torpedos and they were decent, however the bacon was partly raw.  We also tried their ribs on suggestion of our server.  They were tender, but the sauce was not good.  Most grocery store bottled sauces would have been an improvement.   Our server was nice, but we rarely saw her during our visit.  Our drinks were empty most of our dinner.  I hope this establishment improves their game or they will not be in business for very long!"}
{"text":"The security have all clearly been to jail for years and are struggling with obesity.  I haven't been here during dinner hours, but the night life is not all it's cracked up to be.  Just go downtown it's not worth the trouble, unless you are extremely unattractive and aren't in the league of 300 pound 50+'s . If this is your type then have fun at Cabin. Nobody is dancing.  If you go, don't dance or else they'll jick you out.  Having fun is not allowed."}
{"text":"Honestly, this place is as safe a place as you can possibly want. There were two fights, and while I'm not unaccustomed to bar fights, the bar tending staff as well as th bouncing staff cleared thing is quick fast. The bouncer, xxx and bartender xx isolated the altercation, and. Directed it outSide, making the group of girls I was here with feel exceedingly safe. I hope anyone who comes here understands that's drink prices are standard, but the accommodation by the bartenders AND the bouncing crew was exceptional. Nick, tiny, and the rest were absolutely exceptional. They isolated the altercations and pushed them outside faster than I could predict. They deserve major accommodations. I absolutely feel safe with my wife here, no exceptions. I will return very quickly. It's fun for her to dance, and I feel safe around the staff here. 10-10. I will recommend quickly to anyone who asks."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Amazing people, great time, awesome food. Dollar tacos on Tuesdays! Definitely a place to go to regularly! :)"}
{"text":"Outstanding service and food! Located conveniently right off of the 101 and Northern, it's the only place I would go out on the West Side!"}
{"text":"Pretty good. I saw some reviews that said the service was bad. My experience was completely opposite. I've been here twice now and both times service was very good. Very attentive. My boyfriend is obsessed with the ribs lol. I love the avocado rolls. Calamari was ok, they have the strips and I like the Rings. Korean tacos were good. Next time I'll venture out a bit..."}
{"text":"Was there last night and could not believe the crowd! It was pack wall to wall and everywhere you looked people were dancing and having a great time. I saw a few instances where things could have got very ugly but security moved in swiftly and dissolved any issues I was really impressed with that!!!!! I'll definitely be back again and it will be my new favorite hot spot for when any friends come to town!"}
{"text":"My wife and I came here around 2:30-3PM on a Saturday.In other words,the slow time of day for a restaurant. We asked for a booth,but the  three small ones were taken,and we didnt want to sit at the bar,or sit on the high chairs,so they seated us at a very large booth,which had a very wobbly table that also spun.Eating at it was an adventure.Our server was acting strange from the beginning.I asked what kind of sodas they had,and she said \"HUH?\"So I said soft drinks,and she said \"Pepsi Products\".That didn't narrow it down much,so we both ordered ice tea,with my wife asking for no lemon or sugar,which the waitress misunderstood,telling her there was sugar on the table,and giving her lemon in her tea anyway.     The food was really good.We started with chips and salsa,which were decent,but not really warm.My wife had the chicken skewers,and I had the carne asada street tacos.Both were very good,if not really plentiful.     Our server brought us our food and brought us our check,period.We ran out of tea,and she never came back to check on us.I figured it was the old waitress thing of giving the tables ordering alcohol more attention,because the check is always bigger,but she was an equal opportunity neglect-er.Everyone was looking around for service,and this was during their slow period.      Other reviewers have mentioned the decor.I thought the rustic cabin theme was so over the top,including a large portrait of Abe Lincoln.I think it was supposed to be camp or ironic,but I just found it bizarre.        I wish I could have given the place 2 and a half stars,but three will do.Will I come back here?Not with BJ's and Cracker Barrel so close by with much better customer service and larger food portions."}
{"text":"A fun joint! Staff is friendly, food is fresh, delicious and reasonably priced!  Dog friendly too, total plus!  Not a huge fan of Saturday nights as it can turn into a night club after 10 but that shoe fits for others just not my cup of tea. We keep going back time and time again for a great time!  OK, so we've been back a few times after my first review and I have to RE-review the food....  On 1/26/17 We tried the chicken quesadilla Thurs night, (hard to screw up) however it was so salty I couldn't even finish one piece.  Another time before that we had the carne asada tacos and it had a funk to it. Didn't even taste like beef! I'm sure it wasn't the freshest of product this could have been why.  That said, we still enjoy the staff and atmosphere we'll just make sure we eat before going back."}
{"text":"Yuck!  Went with a group of family as we are in tow visiting.  Thought we'd try a new place.  Taco Tuesday looked good so 3 people tried that, I tried the fish and chips and we also tried the macadamia chicken. Horrible service, couldn't get a drink refill to save our lives, tacos came out and two of the guys said \"we will need to order more\" as. each taco is just two bites, needless to say they were nasty and we didn't order anything else.  Fish was dry, chicken wasn't served on potatoes as advertised.  Couldn't get drinks, a bill, lemons ect.  Wish I could get the $150 for a worthless dinner back.  We drove through jack in the box on the way home and thought it wasn't least 3 stars ahead of this place"}
{"text":"Great food.  Cozy and friendly service by Michelle.  Great referral from Telina.  Definitely will be back. And the #4 drink Telina suggested is great. Gotta try it."}
{"text":"Definitely will recommend this restaurant to everyone  The food is Amazing and the customer service  is even better! Thank you Preston for helping us out! We will be back"}
{"text":"The food of this restaurant was very good had the Avocado Egg Roll appetizer, it was excellent . My main course was the Hog and Heifer Burger it was a great burger. My main complaint had to do with the ambiance. Unfortunately the outside seating allowed smoking so we had to change our seats and go inside.  They played music at a sound level that was painful to the ears. It was obvious they were playing the level for the outside customers. They need to invest in a sound system that has two sound level controls. One for outside and one for the inside customer enjoyment."}
{"text":"Wish there was a zero star review...first came in they said \"you can only order from this menu\"...... it had maybe 10 items on the menu....to be good sports we stayed......we ordered and four of the items were disgusting...under cooked, over cooked. Took 20 mins to get a tea....they eventually took off the said items after we sent them back...we basically didn't eat anything but chips....waste of my time..waste of what little money I spent. Wouldn't feed to my dogs. ..... one star because the employees were nice.   Barf"}
{"text":"Ended up here on Valentines Day while on a date night with the hubs. The drinks were tasty & not too cha ching which was nice after stopping in at Tobey Keith's across the parking lot. The music was fun & the crowd wasn't uptight or in all denim which was a definite bonus. I see the other reviews of the staff & the erroneous charges on their cards but I didn't have that & the service both at our table & bar were good. Didn't wait long or anything. I'll have to try again soon to see if I just got lucky. Stay tuned & I'll let ya know."}
{"text":"Drinks were good, service was very good. Ordered chicken kebobs and beef kebobs, each with rice and veggies. Chicken was outstanding, beef a little tough. Live entertainment is a nice touch."}
{"text":"Nice looking restaurant inside and out. Owned by a veteran so that is double good in my books!! I ordered the cabin burger. Very good. The fries were delicious. My husband had the turkey burger with Swiss cheese. Very moist and tasty. Joel our server was on top of things. Overall great bar, fast service and would definitely recommend this as a go to place for friends and large groups. I can only imagine when spring ball is here!! Oh, cool, outdoor bar too!!"}
{"text":"Went in last night at 7:20 PM with my hubby for a bite.  Thought we'd try a burger.  Saw taco Tuesday menu and decided to try.  Place was n I t busy then, several empty tables, but apparently short on wait staff, so had to wait 25 minutes to be seated. Had a drink at bar. Bartender said no drink specials. Ugh. Seated finally, took 15 minutes to get a drink and 29 minutes to get tacos . Nearly an hour and a half to get service and good.  Tacos were fairly good.  Night mgr. Did come over and apologize and adjusted our bill. This could be a great place, but needs some serious management follow up."}
{"text":"I'm leaving this 3rd star because of the effort of the staff in answering my Yelp review. It says a lot of a brand that will attempt to make things right on Yelp and take the time to write a personal answer. Thanks Mei. I will give The Cabin another try. The food was good and the environment wasn't bad. Hopefully, the bar staff is more attentive this time! Thanks for caring about the customer experience The Cabin!"}
{"text":"I'm from California and this is my frist time here at the \"CABIN\" on a \"Saturday\" it was popping no charge to get in and drinks were pretty cheap. I have to say I liked it and would definitely come back. Lots of people chill atmosphere and kool. Security is definitely everywhere too.. I love it"}
{"text":"Upon entering 4 host/hostesses greated us with sour faces. One took us to a seat on the patio. Sat at the table for fifteen minutes and no one ever came over to the table. There were only a few people in the place so being busy was no excuse. After looking at the menu and the high prices ($8.95 for hummus... Really?) We got up and left with the same four standing at the entrance not doing a thing. Good luck getting this place off the ground with this kind of service."}
{"text":"They burnt my chicken skewers..on my birthday.   My husband ordered steak skewers..perfectly cooked.  You could tell his red peppers weren't charcoal..like mine.  Told the manager the problem..he offered a new plate.  Husband was done with his skewers before my new ones arrived.  I ordered another wine as to not feel weird and watch hubby eat without me.  Nothing was comped...the chicken should've been free..or a glass of wine..anything.  service totally sucked as well..13 minutes to get drinks."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for our anniversary and loved the food! The  service and  environment were great.   We had to go back for lunch a different day.  The happy hour is amazing. Their appetizers are so good. I recommend the crab cakes, Daytona wings, and the macaroni balls are to die for."}
{"text":"We have been here three or four times.  Each visit is good!  The drinks are cold and the service is friendly.  Try the salad pizza and thank me later......  It will change your life!"}
{"text":"Went here for taco Tuesday.  Tried the carne asada, chicken, beef, and pork tacos. They were all good.  Would pry come back for a happy hour if it was worth it (don't know their specials).  The only negative I found is:  Chips & salsa is $6 (it is \"unlimited\").  Not worth it & didn't realize there was a charge the way it was presented by the waitress. She said, \"we have unlimited chips & salsa..... blah blah blah about other food.. do you want some chips and salsa?\"  Obviously if you frequent restaurants, you know chips & salsa are usually free and \"unlimited\" .... but not here. Don't get confused and don't bother with it because it doesn't even seem like in house cooked chips with authentic salsa."}
{"text":"Couldn't find a where to eat and we stumbled upon this place. We went on a Thursday early afternoon. It was pretty empty, a few middle aged men standing at the outside bar/yard. We sat inside, next to some roll up windows which I'm assuming roll up during the late night hours. Our waitress was super nice and helpful and helped us pick out some meals she recommended. We felt super welcome and got our food right away. My mom got the app chicken wings buffalo style. The chicken wings had a cajun-early flavor or an after bite taste, super meaty as well. My mom got a side of French fries which let me just say they were amazing!! We've never had french fries like this before, super soft inside yet crispy on the outside. I got the sundried tomato walnut pesto pasta. It's a reddish sauce with fettuccine noodles. It came with onions, zucchini, blackened chicken pieces, mushrooms, sun dried tomatoes and broccoli. Super flavorful and would get it again! All in all I would come again for food and will have to try it for a late night bar experience!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I had a GREAT!!!!experience. Our server Amber Bree was SUPER!! She kept coming back to ask us for drinks and chips and salsa refills. the food and appetizers were really great. I really liked that the manager came and introduced herself and asked us how everything was going? I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Took awhile to get waited on once we chose our seats.  It's Sat night,  so no Happy Hour. Anyway,  walked in and sat next to rusted metal wall which pulled my clothing. I didn't like it.  Our waitress was great.  My husband and I ordered chips with  salsa and torpedoes for an app.  The salsa was fresh,  more than likely homemade.  Tasted very flavorful.  However the chips were stale.  The torpedoes tasted great after we pulled the undercooked bacon off of them.  The bacon was cooked, it was just not crispy, still white and fatty. My husband's Moscow mule was not served in a copper cup. The copper cup is needed for the chemical reaction that occurs in this particular drink.  My husband ordered fish and chips and liked his meal a lot.  The fries were crispy and hot.  I ordered fish tacos.  the first ones I sent back to the kitchen.  They were too heavily salted for my taste.  My husband agreed. Our server brought fresh ones out in a flash.  These were tasty.  All in all,  I will not be returning to this restaurant.  I just was not comfortable in this space.  It was just a cold bar/restaurant that lacked the cozy cabin appeal. Lackluster in my opinion."}
{"text":"Long week, hot day. Get off work, found a new spot to eat. I wouldn't bring children here, but great for grown ups. Specializes in Whiskey, Bourban and Scotch but have a HUGE liquor selection. 20 beers on tap, GREAT food, staff ON POINT, not too pricey. AMAZING!!!!! Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Nice place nice atmosphere, food was good. Came for happy hour & dinner service was terrible! Drinks empty it was like they walked pass u with blind folds on the entire time. And they by know means we're busy at all. Kinda sad  came here from Kansas City found the place on Yelp with my son. Bad choice to say the least. Not next time."}
{"text":"Overall great experience!!! I came here a week ago and Gerald was my server, he was very friendly and knowledgable about the food. The atmosphere was very unique and they played good music. I would recomend it to anyone looking for a good time on the weekend."}
{"text":"I checked out the menu on line and found they do Angus meat and have hamburgers with poblano chile's so I gave them a try. My server was Saline and she did an outstanding job along with the table helpers everything was delivered quickly and this was Happy hour Friday night. I ordered the Santa Fe burger that comes with fries. As Happy hour pricing was on , I ordered the fried calamari and was pleasantly surprised to find they weren't pieces but 2 to 3 in strips with what seemed to be a spiced Thai medium sauce over a bed of fried won ton. For me everything was perfect- I'm a Senior with a bothersome  case of tinnitus and although it was noisy it didn't bother me as everything was most enjoyable. I will frequent this place again soon."}
{"text":"We ordered the BLT and it was delicious! There was SOOO much bacon on it, 1/2 lb on ONE sandwich!! Never seen a BLT with so much Bacon before, it was great!! Our server Raina was great too! Very attentive and knowledgeable about all things Cabin Whiskey. We'll definitely be returning again!"}
{"text":"Have eaten here many times. Each time we have had really great service. The BLT sandwich is what a real BLT should be like with a half a pound of bacon . Excellent pork chops and steaks, cooked to order. The management was there and was making sure that we were happy with the food and service."}
{"text":"I love this place! Best place to go in this area! Every Sunday they have a pig roast!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Great service.  Ordered take out tonight, and expectations meet BUT narry a damn napkin.  If you can't master the basics the rest doesn't matter."}
{"text":"My visit to Cabin was a very delightful experience. My husband and I had the pleasure of meeting a remarkable young server, his name was Patrick. He exceeded our expectations from beginning to end. He has a very fun vibrant personality and anticipated our every need. He also informed us of the live music and the trivia that is played weekly. We live close and will definitely be back to request him in the future."}
{"text":"**UPDATED 03/05/2018**  Food was much better second time around, service was awesome as well.  We were impressed by the kids meal actually.  It was real mac n cheese, not instant Kraft.... And the other kids meal was well made as well.  Not a fan of the chips and salsa but everything else we had was really good.  Raising up to four stars.    **********  First thing noticed was how dirty it was all over the parking lot from the late nite activities from the day before.  Give a guy a blower or a broom for goodness sake.   Really had high expectations based on menu descriptions.  Unfortunately the execution of the menu was sub par.  Said poke and got seared ahi ... Ugh.  Really???   Wings were alright. ... But still not matching what the menu describes.   Cool decor, cool menu... Too bad it fell apart after that.  Not being nit picky.... Just know what I read and what I expected.    It's the old Sandbar I think... I'm sure another place will rotate thru this spot,  just like they all do in this shopping center."}
{"text":"Check out the $7 lunch specials. The basic cheeseburger was delicious, grilled perfectly, came with tasty fries. Also tried the fish tacos which were smaller quantity of food but tasted so good. Fish wasn't fishy, avocado slice and chipotle sauce were great combination. Love the cabin decor."}
{"text":"I definitely should have heeded the negative reviews. 2 stars given for the spinach dip.  My husband was in town from work and we decided to check out this place. We love whiskey and the online menu looked good. We arrived at lunchtime and were one of five tables. We did not receive lunch or drink menus, just the standard full menu, despite multiple menus laid across the counter. The waitress came and asked for our drink order. When I asked her for a drink menu, she said there wasn't one, and handed me a piece of paper from her pocket with handwritten beers, then produced a bartender card that listed all their drinks and how to make them. How can you boast yourself a whiskey bar and have nothing for me to even see what types of alcohol you carry?? We ordered a few apps to split; all were sub par and tasted like they were pre packaged. Despite all the doors being closed, we were pestered by numerous flies the entire meal. $65 later we left completely unfulfilled and still hungry. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this place. Nothing about it is remotely worth it"}
{"text":"Every time I've gone here's never been drink specials, the environment is pretty cool very different, the Friday night DJ is the most random ever- house to 90's jams within no time just no real flow I guess. Bartenders are super serious, food was ok there was just nothing awesome that popped! The big beers are a hit and pretty cool, there needs to be some outdoor games for that huge patio."}
{"text":"Food and service was pretty good. VERY noisy. Food a little pricey, it is bar food afterall. Not sure if we will be back because of the noise. Can't have a conversation."}
{"text":"This place has horrible service. I waited 45 minutes to get drinks. The server was horrible and rude."}
{"text":"Veteran owned - top-notch service!  Avocado Egg Rolls = AMAZING!  Best burger we've ever had - seriously!  Coleslaw also noteworthy!  Great beer selection.  Fun patio!  Loved everything about this place!"}
{"text":"The food was good. The service on the other hand sucks. The wait staff is too busy flirting with each other to do their job. The girls are cute. The one who delivered our food should have been wearing a hair net or at least had her hair up."}
{"text":"The Cabin is my go to spot for happy hour. They have some of the best appetizers around and great drink specials. Plus they're a Phoenix Foodies sponsor and their special to card holders is awesome. Highly recommended The Cabin!!!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately a few of the bouncers/cocktail waitress at this place don't know how to give proper customer service. I was kicked out last night because 1. I stood on the bottom ledge of the chair for 30 seconds looking for a friend on the other side of the bar (he asked me once before to not do that and I admit I did do it again 2 minutes later he then said if you do it again you're out to which I replied I'm really sorry man I'm just looking for someone won't happen again) so at that point I was on their \"radar\" 2. Girl walking around with random juice shots asks me if I want one to which I replied \"no I'm good that's stuff is just juice and sugar\" (jokingly) she did not like that reply so she said something sarcastic and walked away. About an hour later she walks by again and I jokingly said \"me me me\" she rolls her eyes and says \"yea sure you do\" to which I reply \" I'm just kidding come on girl don't lie you know that's just sugar and juice\" (once again in a joking tone just to have conversation) her response was \"you're really annoying\" so at this point I realize she's obviously just having a rough night and uninterested in me joking around with her so I just say \"thanks I'll work on that\" and she walked away. 2 minutes later I'm getting kicked out because to the bouncer \"i keep causing problems\" keep in mind I'm in the industry and only had 2 drinks at this time. I treated the bouncers, my personal server, and patrons around me with nothing but respect yet for those 2 very minor issues he kicked me out. I calmly explained my side of the story to the main bouncer (no slurring, respectful, didn't curse) and he didn't care at all they made their mind up before I could say my side. Being in the industry and never being kicked out of a place I found it very upsetting to be treated like that. Some of the staff did a great job and I don't want to bad mouth everyone but a select few really give terrible customer service at this place and some of their bouncers act like they are watching over a prison and not a public bar where people go to socialize and have a good time. I get trusting and listening to your staff but to kick someone out for that is absolutely insane!"}
{"text":"A friend once told me that every mistake can cost you a client or earn you a client for life depending on how you handle your mistake.  So very true.   We went to the cabin for dinner and I wanted to come here to see what whiskeys were available.  I have been here in the past and had always been impressed on whiskeys that are not easily found else where.  For example, last year on my birthday I enjoyed some Pappy Van Winkle. Well today a mistake was made.  No problem... It happens, but the professionalism in which it was handled earned my continued business.   Wide selection at the bar, specially with whiskey, and wonderful steaks, appetizers and sides."}
{"text":"Fun place  Large portions,good food,good service. We went at happy hour and beers were only two bucks,can't beat that. Little pricey , but not for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"This was my worst experience in the US ever, the bouncer didn't let me in cuz he was being a racist mf, even when I showed him my ID, my crossing card and my passport he did not let me go in cuz \"it was not a valid ID\"  even when I called before to ask if they accepted my Mexican Id and they told me yes, I went to that place and they told me no...... Id never had this problem before, he Called his \"manager\"  he wasn't even  wearing an uniform and he was casual af, he was unprofessional, he should work getting his so called bouncers if you're the owner of this place you should take a look on your people"}
{"text":"This place turns into an attractive bar at night and I don't have any complaints about the alcohol, the music, the atmosphere, the building itself or anything like that. What I will say though is the DJ that I have seen there both times I've gone is SUPER RUDE. This guy looked angry as well when I was first there and that already started to kill my vibe. So not very surprisingly, once I interacted with him for the first time to request a song, he had a very harsh and rude response. That's a no-go for a bar/club business. This person is pretty much the tone setter for the whole place. There's plenty experienced and motivated DJs out there so this one should be FIRED immediately."}
{"text":"Went to the cabin for the first time last night!  I had a blast,  everyone around me seemed to be too!  Lots of dancing and a great DJ!  The bartenders were quick to get your order.  Which was great! I also loved seeing the bouncers interact with the crowd and dance with people.  They didn't give off the douche bag vibe like all the bouncers at Toby Keith's.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great spot on Cardinal home games or to enjoy a night out. On home Cards games they even offer a free shuttle to and from the game. Save $ on a parking pass and get dropped off close to the entrance and picked up after.   The food, drinks and service is 2nd to none. Not only the waitstaff, bartenders and hostesses doing a great job but the managers also take the time to insure everything exceeds expectations. The Cabin Torpedoes and Avocado egg rolls are both amazing. Have to say, not a bad thing on the menu.     The outside bar is also fantastic. Beer pong, corn hole, TVs and misters. Very kid friendly as well. I am a father of 3 young kids and my wife and I both have 10+ years in the service industry and know a good place when we find one. The Cabin is a great spot."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here at 7pm on the first Saturday after this place opened. Beers on tap were good and the mixed drinks were just right. We got the Cabin Torpedos appetizer. It is bacon wrapped jalapeno with pepper jack cream cheese and chunks of tender beef brisket. They are very tasty and a little pricy for $9 for 5 poppers. Our server Cassidy was very nice and helpful to us and even kept finding us after we moved about the bar. We paid around $93 for all our drinks and appetizer. Would definitely come back if we didn't live 45 minutes away."}
{"text":"Great service and food! The service was truly amazing.  if the staff can keep this level of service up every Cardinals game day we will make this our pre-game meeting place!"}
{"text":"After having a bad experience at another bar we can here and had an amazing experience. The bartender was very attentive and let us know if all specials going. He was very good and informative let us know as we were leaving he hope to see us back. We will definitely be returning thanks to the amazing service from Gerald."}
{"text":"This place has gotten much better. We go there Friday nights for happy hour the service has been exceptional you can't beat the deals and the place is packed many times we have come in to live bands playing which is awesome"}
{"text":"I won't be going back ever. All around bad. After 40 mins waiting for appetizers, we canceled our order."}
{"text":"I took my Mom and children here for lunch. The food is very good and portions are huge!!! The atmosphere is relaxing and welcoming. Mark, the manager was friendly and very helpful!!!! I have gone back with my wife for dinner and also had my daughter's graduation party there! Every time we go there, whether it's for lunch, dinner or to celebrate it's always perfect!!!!"}
{"text":"Smoked house salmon was NOT SMOKED!!! Carne asada had no flavor! Ahi poke was dry and old!"}
{"text":"Wow. Worst customer service experience in my life. Enough said.  But... Let me elaborate.  Besides the fact that there are supposedly 19 owners... They're all perverts and sketchy  as f$&@k.   Not to mention one of the business owners was visibly WASTED and practically falling over himself while simultaneously bombarding one of my girlfriends with his failed attempts at \"flirting\".   As women, it's pretty much the most uncomfortable experience  you can have to be harassed by staff all night.   Will not be coming back and will not recommend any girlfriends coming here."}
{"text":"Ordered from Uber Eats due to the fact our group did not have a craving for our normal pizza or fast food options and the Cabin is super close to home. Carolina pork sandwich and the burgers were great! I have not eaten at the establishment as of yet but plan to in the near future due to our takeout experience. Hence the 4 star review. I plan to update once I've experienced the atmosphere as well."}
{"text":"I like this place. Good atmosphere. Good food. I recommend the BLT. Great place to gather with friends. The way the servers are assigned tables makes service a bit slow though."}
{"text":"We had lunch at  the Cabin today, we ordered off the $7,00 menu ,great selection I had Chicken GREAT PLACE FOR LUNCH"}
{"text":"We finally went back. Im glad we did. Much more pleasant experience. Staff was great...food was good...they've done allot with the place and it came together and looks great."}
{"text":"I give the BLT big fat fabulous. The coconut chicken tenders ok. And our waitress was great. Then a couple of wait staff start moving chairs and tables behind us and man was it noisy screechy and rude. There was barely anyone in there. Too many young people and no one managing. Like an adult acting professional."}
{"text":"I have had almost everything on the menu!!  Great food and drinks.  Brandon and Leah are top notch"}
{"text":"Bottom line, the death of this place will be the service. I had never liked Sand Bar and was happy to see something new in it's spot. My first visit was about 2 weeks ago. It was Saturday night and surprisingly empty, but somehow the service was still slow. We were greeted and brought our drinks quickly, but after telling our server we needed a few mins before ordering our entree, she disappeared for a good 15 mins. When she returned all she did was awkwardly stand there and say \"hey\"... so I ordered the Black Bean Burger with Onion Rings and my Dad ordered the Crab Cake Sandwich. Damn, it was really good! Despite being confused by our servers attitude and flighty demeanor, we were pleased with our meal. I decided to give this place another shot tonight. My boyfriend and I were celebrating an early Valentines Day and he had never been. Again, we were greeted promptly and by the SAME server I had the last time. She brought us our drinks promptly and low and behold, disappeared. In this time, we watched a table next to us get up and leave after 15 mins of no service. It seems like they are gravely understaffed or have hired unqualified people for the positions. I ordered the Turkey Burger this time which was just ok.. My BF's Pulled Pork sandwich was flavorful but dry, and we were left thirsty many times. A pro, good draft beers, but only managed to get 2 beers in the 2 hours we were there. Seemed like we were just being ignored but heard other tables complain of similar problems with different servers... I really want this place to succeed. I enjoy it more then the meathead bouncers and airhead servers over at TK's.. So please, get it together."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend on a Friday night around 7. The service was a little slow but it being a Friday night I didn't think much about it. I ordered a water with my drink and was told by the waitress that she would try but they were out of glasses at the bar. I said ok, didn't think much about it but did receive a water later on. Food was served pretty quickly and was ok, typical bar/restaurant food. However when my salad came out and I asked for silverware I was told that they would try and was told they were out of silverware. I couldn't quite figure out how I would eat my salad without a fork. We did have to ask twice for silverware. After our meal was served and finally given silverware our waitress totally disappeared for a half hour, never checking back in or someone else checking in. In looking around the restaurant/bar there were several empty tables. I would expect this kind of service in a busy restaurant. After finally receiving our check we paid and quickly left. I will not be going back there anytime soon. I hope they resolve their lack of silverware and cup issues."}
{"text":"We tried the Cabin a few months ago. The server was really nice, but felt it was a bit slow to get our drink orders in.  We got there just after opening, so I chalked it up that. We shared a chicken sandwich which was pretty good. The mac and cheese balls are really good too. Once we got the food order in, it arrived fairly quickly (they were not really busy). It was not a bad experience. They do play country music, but I won't hold that against them. ;-)  We tried a second time this weekend.  It was not a bad experience, and the food is good. We have only tried a few things on the menu, but what we have tried has been good (a though the fish tacos were a bit meh though).  Our server was super nice, but he disappeared for long periods of time.  We came for lunch around 1:30pm, and we were there well over 90 minutes.  That's a long time for lunch. This is the main reason I am giving them a 3 and not 4. I think if they can fix the service issues (the time, not the quality) this could become a regular stop for us, but for now, I'd avoid it if we are limited on time."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food here. The apps before 7 are half off and I love the pork rinds. The service was good with a call out to Cassidy who was very prompt and on top of both drinks and food. Good live music too."}
{"text":"Wow! What a shit experience! Go there before Cardinals game, decent food and drinks.  Then go to Cardinals game and return afterwards to be denied entry after two beers. Upfront and honest with so called security guard then sent back to our vehicle which they called Maicopa County Sheriff who parked next to us to try and catch us for DUI. Forgot to mention they let my wife in and her friend but stopped my friend. It was ladies night so that must be their reasoning for allowing my wife in and denying my friend. We ubered Home, never going back to this shit show. Typical West Valley garbage management and set up......."}
{"text":"My friends and I would come here all the time, so we brought our friend here for her birthday. After 3 drinks in 2.5 hours she was walking back from the bathroom and stumbled when someone knocked into her. The manager then pulled her aside and yelled at her until she she cried and kicked her out of the bar, even after several security guards were telling him that someone bumped her. So needless to say we won't be returning since the management feels the need to show his authority by making guests cry and disregarding his own staff."}
{"text":"Not happy I love this place. I come here at least twice a week with my family to eat your amazing food but its fathers day. and I seen a very cool special. now this my day and im upset now  Said happy hour open to close 50 cent wings  And 15.50 for bottomless bloodymarys and mimosas I called at 1pm  to ask how busy for there special they said there's no tables but I can make a reservation for a table so I did for 4pm. I show up with my family after I live in scottdale and am now told the false advertisement. from open to close  stopped at 2pm nothing in your add said there wa s a time limit to these specials just open to close  now the wings is still fine they said but till they run out? When I brought up I was gonna put a bad review if its not fixed. like it should be. the worker said ok then!!! and walked away. not what can I do for you.. well you made me walk out of your restaurant period . I'm actually gonna eat my chips and salsa and drink my beer and leave and will never come back here again."}
{"text":"The Cabin Whiskey & Grill is a casual restaurant in Peoria. They offer a WIDE variety of mostly American Comfort Food some with International twists. The atmosphere is rustic with lots of worn looking wood, trophies (dead animals) and camouflaged covered cushions. I warn you that it is also very loud in there with what some people might consider party music. They offer a very large bar with lots of seating, table seating, comfortable booths and outdoor seating.  We shared a Fried Macaroni 'N' Cheese Appetizer. We received five large pieces with a house made BBQ Ranch Dipping Sauce. I do have to give them credit....This is the best Fried Macaroni and Cheese appetizer I ever tried anywhere because the Texture was absolutely perfect. Nice thin crisp crunchy coating that seemed oil free and creamy Mac 'n' Cheese inside. The only problem was the lack of seasoning.....I never salt food out...often things are too salty for me so when I salt something it really needs it......Also when I bit into some parts I only got white sauce and no cheese........maybe this was just an off batch...  For my meal I tried the Korean Street Tacos. The flat iron steak was nice and tender but lacked Flavors of Korean Marinade. They were topped with a lime forward slaw that lacked cilantro. When I applied the Hot Chile sauce the single shelled tacos dissolved...... :(   My husband had the Buffalo Breaded Chicken Sandwich. It was cute and the bun was branded with a \"C\" for Cabin. Like the Mac 'N' Cheese Balls this chicken was breaded and fried masterfully. It didn't even seem fried but was juicy and coated in a tangy hot buffalo sauce. Fries were coated, seasoned and hot and crisp.  It really wouldn't take much at all for the food to be 4 stars to me. Whoever was cooking has really great frying skills...For me it was just a few little things that make a difference.   Lack of seasoning in the Macaroni and Cheese Balls..maybe adding parmesan would help with the lack of salt and flavor.  For the Korean Street Tacos a marinade that includes soy sauce, vinegar, sugar, ginger, sesame and hot pepper would add lots of flavor to the beef and double shelling the tacos might help so they don't crumble and fall apart.  3.5 just like the Yelp average"}
{"text":"Not impressed at all.  Service was terrible. First table we sat at was unstable and didn't fit the booth it was in.  We moved to another table, no big deal. Our drink order came out in a timely manner the first time, after that it took at least 20 min to see our server and another 20 min to get our drinks. I seriously thought she forgot about them.  When she came back she blamed the bartender.  Not cool, especially since they weren't busy.  We did overhear our the host offer our server another table while we sat and she accepted but clearly couldn't handle the 2. She then complained that she had another bigger table outside and they they had her running.  What about us? Throughout our experience she disappeared for long periods of time.  Only half our table got their food while the other 2 in our party waited for theirs again almost 20 min. Never again, which is sad, because the food was descent.  You would think that a re-opening of the place the manager would be out making sure every shift went awesome but there was no one to be seen.  I will say that the busser was more helpful than our server at times, but he was too young to bring us our beer."}
{"text":"We went here on a date night. I was thinking it was a steakhouse atmosphere, but it wasn't. More of a bar feel. It was ok and we were on our way to a movie so we decided to stay. The small table they put us at was kind of cramped, but it was ok. We started with the chips and salsa which seemed like store-bought chips even though the menu stated that they are homemade (which is why we got them). Maybe they are, but at least serve them warm if you're going to call them homemade! The salsa was better than the chips. I got the chicken poblano. I expected chicken breasts covered in sauce but it was all chopped up together. It was ok, but I only ate the chicken, the rest was a little too spicy for me. The side dish was fried masa? It's a good start but lacked flavor. My husband got the walnut chicken salad sandwich. It's huge! He said the chicken salad was good but strangely lacking in walnuts for a dish with \"walnut\" as the first word. The bread looked like one step above Roman Meal bread (very plain). The sweet potato fries were fine. Nothing special but nothing wrong with them either. I had a beer that was really good, it was an orange vanilla beer. Overall, we won't go back. Didn't like the atmosphere and the food was mediocre."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place and from the moment we walked in we were greeted by a big smile and friendly face. We sat at the bar in the main dining area and Leah the bartender was fabulous.! We asked alot of questions from the range of drinks and which they were known for she was very informed and knew everything we wanted to know about their signature items as well.. Great place and she made us feel very welcome. The menu had alot of variety in their choices and very well priced. If you have not tried this place yet I suggest you do you will not be disappointed. We will be back next time we are in town and I will be sure to share this gem of a find to everyone I know."}
{"text":"So unless you want a fuckin gun pulled out on you by the cops the owners rent to hire during the weekend for a simple mistake then dont come here! These cops are obviously ready to kill! They obviously don't know how to use a tazer or pepper spray!!!! Instead they rather be ready to kill so they obviously have no idea how to handle intoxicated customers! Because their first reaction is to kill!!! So its not safe! Go to west gate! Literally in the same night i saw a fight break out in both places and the way they reacted is very opposite from each other west gate cops are very calm and keep it together and literally the cops at the cabin were ready to fire the guns and ready to kill and thats not fuckin right! Anyone who has trained military or police force knows how lethal pepper spray can have side effects that can last for 3days theres no excuse for whipping your guns out!!  Keep in mind about the past incident with surprise police killed that man and shot him repeatedly multiple times excessively!!!! More than they fuckin have to! This extreme force has to stop its unnecessary! The family is even suing the cops that killed that kid about the surprise incident because it was so excessive! Seriously get it together dude! And anyways Same fuckin bar (cabin) that will let women walk into men's restroom thinking its cute but yet a man walks in a women's restroom hes fuckin animal and lets throw him the fuck out!? Obviously equal rights don't exist"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Came here during happy hour and was immediately waited on. We ordered the torpedoes, quesadilla, and avocado egg rolls. Everything was DELICIOUS and half price during happy hour. The egg rolls were our favorite. They were crispy and filled with cream cheese and lots of avocado. The quesadilla was really good! Tons of chicken and cheese and came with this really good green salsa. The torpedoes were tasty, but I would've liked the jalapeños to be cooked a little longer. Some of them were not spicy and some of them were extremely spicy, which I guess happens with jalapeños so not really their fault. The waiter was very attentive! He checked on us probably five times during the hour we were there. We live close so this will be our new happy hour spot! There were so many appetizers that sounded delicious that we need to try.  Update: get the chicken poblano. Amazing."}
{"text":"So I've been to this place a few times and I must say this is a great place. Before today I've come here with all adults and today I've brought my daughter. This is a child friendly place, even Friday and Saturday nights, before 10pm.   They have very fresh food and fantastic service! I had the shrimp and chicken pasta today and the shrimp was fantastic along with the rest of the dish. Sometimes with Shrimp dishes the shrimp tastes day old, you know what I mean, and these did not. The food was very good and I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Such a great dining experience! Found a deal on groupon and decided to treat my boyfriend to a nice dinner. Neither of us have been here so we figured why not.  Started with the avocado egg rolls, delicious! I'm a vegetarian so I got the black bean burger with onion rings. The kitchen gave me fries instead, but when I told our waiter, she immediately got a HUGE plate on the side that my boyfriend and I ended up sharing.  He's a meat eater and got some kind shrimp pasta and loved it! The portion was huge so he ended up taking some home for the next day's lunch and loved it even more a second time!   Best meal we've had in a LONG time and the bill was 11$ after a $12 groupon!! 30 after tip and it was by far a 5star experience!"}
{"text":"After attending the Cardinals Football practice a group of 7 happy and loud bunch of family and friends found even more fun rounding up at Cabin Whiskey.  5 star menu!  Taryn, our waitress was both attentive and funny with a good attitude.  Great time with good vibes, great food enjoyed by all and great staff.  Thanks, Cabin Whiskey!!!"}
{"text":"This place is terrible. I ordered a drink normally $3 and got charged $30. I wouldn't recommend it especially on a Thursday night. Going to talk to management about this because this is not acceptable!"}
{"text":"Good experience at Cabin. Friendly staff, never waited for anything. Food was good, drinks were better. Will visit again."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in the food, I don't know what they use the passes calamari but it wasn't calamari... Their beer selection is very limited given the fact they are right next to BJ's. Drink specials are okay $7 for 25 oz beer isn't bad for happy hour house cab was 3 bucks not too bad. They do this buffalo shrimp which is just basically breading with buffalo sauce very little shrimp, but for five bucks I wasn't going to complain. I don't think I've paid 10 for it though. We sat at the bar and our bartender was friendly. she checked on us a couple times. we did have the salad wedge which was fantastic but let's be honest how you going to screw up a salad wedge"}
{"text":"Been here 3 times and all times food had to be sent back due to not hot enough.  This did not bother me as much when I ordered 2 32 oz four peak kiltliffter.  When we got our bill the beers were 13.00 each totaling 26.00 for just 2 beers.  I have ordered the same 32 oz other locations some better quality and the most have paid 7.50.  I think this is a ripe off and the 1 star. I am giving should be zero.  Not to say will never go back to this place."}
{"text":"Paid $8 fucking dollars for a Long Iced Tea. No liquor to make me get chills or a sour face! Like wtf!! Big rip off!!"}
{"text":"Well I gave this place the benefit of the doubt and was underwhelmed with my experience. I expected a little more than the ho-hum barely there remodel that obviously had zero thought put into it, I really didn't see \"The Cabin\" look they were going for. Let's move on to the food my wife had the grilled pork chops and garlic mashed potatoes which the chops were slightly overcooked but the potatoes were good. I had the bbq pulled pork sandwich and coleslaw with a baked potato. I figure when eating at a bar stick to bar food. My sandwich was extremely dry and flavorless, shredded cardboard covered in bbq sauce would have tasted better! Thank god for the coleslaw and baked potato. We did have the stuffed jalapeños which were good but the limp bacon they were wrapped in seemed to be under cooked. All in all it sucked but I gave it two stars because the new waitress was attentive and  friendly; however I will try it out one more time but if I have the same experience I won't be back."}
{"text":"Went yesterday (Sunday) for dinner and to my absolute delight...Happy Hour! Totally impressed  that there is Happy Hour in the 5' o'clock hour on a Sunday!! That right there earns you 5 stars from me, not to mention the wonderful variety on the menu. Sunday is the day  when my hubby and I go out for dinner and guess where we will be coming back to...so don't discontinue what I call \"Happy Sunday\"!! Now for our food reviews.... our burgers were excellent, my side salad was excellent, the onion rings were excellent and of course our appetizer and my wine were wonderfully excellent. I can't wait until next time to try something else when we go out for Happy Sunday"}
{"text":"Great food but the drink prices will empty your wallet... 2 large beers for $22... I sure didn't feel like I drank $22 worth of beer... What a shocker... No wonder they don't put the drink prices on the menu..."}
{"text":"Went for our first time and initial thoughts were good. Nice menu, nice bar. Employees were nice and manager came over and stated that since it was our first visit, she would comp part of the bill. She took off over 30 percent including alcohol. But....after going to restroom it cost them 2 stars. In the men's room nothing had been wiped down and it was filthy. Two of the five urinals had plastic bags taped over them stating that they were out of order.It was absolutely filthy. My wife noted that the cloth seating was dirty. I reported the filthy bathrooms to the same manager that I complimented earlier. Some careful cleaning and this place could get 4 or 5 stars."}
{"text":"I went during happy hour so most of the appetizers were half off which was awesome! The braided pretzel was delicious, and so was the buffalo shrimp. We ordered the potato skins which were not so good, the order only came with two and they were flavorless. The waiter was really nice about it and took it back with no charge. We also got the skillet cookie which was absolutely delicious, I highly recommend this dessert if you like chocolate chip cookies."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner while on business trip. Monday night football was on. Kinda loud but not bad. Ordered chips n salsa for app. They were ok. Seemed a little stale. Chips were hard but salty. And salsa waa super runny. No real chunkyness. Like tomato soup. It was ok flavor wise. Ordered the steak skewers for dinner. I ordered them medium cooked. They came out well done. Over cooked and very chewey. Not good when overcooked. But the flavor wasn't that bad. Came with a side of veggies and rice. Both were delicious. Would come again. I mean it is Bar food afterall.  Cabin cabin don't let me down  I wanna come back so you change my frown.  I'll order it right.... So You'll make it good.. Just like I knew you could.  One more try to test your skills I'll be there for cold beer refills"}
{"text":"Came here last Friday night with my wife. Ordered nachos with chicken. They were so disgusting and the chicken tasted like it came from a can. My wife ordered one of their special drinks and they were out of one of the ingredients so they couldn't make it. It was only a little after 6pm. Wouldn't recommend and won't be going back."}
{"text":"Parkwest Jewel! Great service, food and price! Friday night happy hour, no wait, seated right away! The atmosphere was loud, friendly, and bubbly, which just added to our fantastic experience. A definite A++++"}
{"text":"This place wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either. The selection of draft beers was decent, the food nothing special, overall just ok. They're definitely overpriced for what you get, on both drinks and food. This was our first time here, and I don't think we'll be returning. There are just way better places to eat and drink for the price."}
{"text":"I feel like i need to give them another chance but that will be later on in the future because they are far from my area. They left a bad taste because as we were already inside after they thouroughly checked our ID's some other guy (i think was the manager) came directly to our table to ask for our ID's again. Of course i started asking him questions as to why he was doing this and all he could say is he does this randomly to double check. First of all do you not trust your employees to do their job. As a manager it's super important to have trust in your teammates so that bothered me. Second he said he did this to random people and i kept my eye on him and we were the only ones that he had to \"recheck\" our ID's.   Anyhow other than that they did have good music and waitresses that stayed on top of our drinks and had specials for Thursday which was a perk. It was a chilly night so they were kind enough to bring out heaters in the outside patios."}
{"text":"Went to watch UFC 200 tonight and the place was hoppin. Tons of people, good food and excellent service by our server Amber B... You go girl! The only bummer was the heat! Yes we live in AZ, and yes it's the middle of summer, but they opened the doors before the sun went down and it caused a sweat fest for everyone. It was warm and funky in there! The bathrooms were a hoot they had attendants. The men's restroom had a DJ and a disco ball, can't make that up. The ladies had Susie who was a very nice lady who handed out lollipops and mints. Over all it was a great experience despite the heat. We had fried Mac and Cheese and the fish and chips. Tasty goodness and the sweet potato fries are worth the dollar upgrade, just sayn."}
{"text":"Outstanding customer service great food and great selection of music and activities for the whole family"}
{"text":"The Cabin has a great Happy Hour!  They have a wide variety of appetizers for $5 and of course cheaper drinks.  I enjoyed their hummus tray.  You can ask for refills and it is so much cheaper than ordering another one.  The coconut chicken in skewers is amazing as well!  They are right off of Northern and the 101.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is excellent!! I don't know who is sleeping on this place! The service was amazing! The drinks where even better and the food was to die for! The ambiance was great! I was in flip flops and they made me fell at home! This is a gem of Peoria, and I'm coming back for sure! They just won a new loyal customer! If your looking for a great dining experience or a great place to have drinks with friends, this is the place to be!"}
{"text":"This spot had been vacant for awhile and I'm now glad The Cabin has moved in. The food was delicious and they have plenty of choices I will need to try out. I now have new option close by that I can stop at and get great food."}
{"text":"We stopped in between 4-7pm and took advantage of the happy hour specials which are half price appetizers and good deals on draft, too. We had the pulled pork sliders, blackened chicken quesadilla and Carne asado tacos. Everything was delicious. The pork was melt in your mouth, the tacos were simple yet oh-so-tasty, and the quesadilla was thick with cheese and chicken. The service was attentive but not intrusive. Gerald was our waiter and we will ask for him next time. Lastly the atmosphere was happy casual. We really enjoyed everything, including the total price, which was a pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"Went here today for lunch (Friday 4/20) they claim that on Friday you can get $5 fireball, $5 patron or $5 3 amigos margaritas. I got the marg and my boyfriend got his favorite space dust IPA. The marg was delicious! So we just had to get more after our first round. Everything was great until the bill came. We were charged $7 for each marg. When I asked why she said \"the deals are only at night\" even tho it was under the \"Friday\" special. Thursday and Saturday even had different specials from the day and the \"night\" prices but Friday was just a solid \"all day\" special. But when asked again why it was like this she said \"well if you would've asked me I could've told you it was only a night. My computer just rings in that way\" I was just very taken back by how RUDE the bartender was and how unclear this menu is for drinks. You should change your Friday margaritas a to only a special time like your Thursday and Saturday so people aren't surprised by their bill. Very pissed when leaving this place because of your BEYOND RUDE BARTENDER. BEEY UNPROFESSIONAL."}
{"text":"This was our first visit.  We've driven by many times, but today we wanted to have lunch on a patio and there is a big patio at this place. Turns out the large doors separating the patio and restaurant were open, so we choose to sit at a table inside, but bordering the patio - the best of both worlds.    We arrived 1:30 pm on a Thursday; the restaurant was not too busy so we somewhat expected decent service - but, WOW - Kudos to our server \"Genesis\" - she was exceptional!   She answered our many questions, continuously checked back and was a pleasure to work with.    Their menu is extensive.  Our food, a pork barbeque sandwich and fish tacos from the lunch menu, were very tasty and fresh.  We also shared an ice cream and brownie sundae, which I would highly recommend.  We will be back."}
{"text":"This place is Awesome! Super friendly staff and wonderful delicious food, drinks and dessert. We were on this side of town and decided to try someplace new and glad we stopped here. I got a meatball sub and my wife got a flat iron steak, we finished off with a Cookie Ice Cream dessert. Even the manager stopped by to ask how we were doing. Highly recommend this place. And Bonus 32 is draft beer  NICE"}
{"text":"We visited at 4:30 PM on 3/14/15.   When the line at BJ's was too long, we tried The Cabin.  There was no wait.  Now we know why!  There were four people in our party.  We arrived at the hostess stand.  No one was there.  We stood there for a couple of minutes before someone came over and told us to seat ourselves.    Once seated, we waited 5 minutes before the waiter came over.  We placed our drink orders.  One water, one Shirley Temple, one Bud Light Draft and a Ginger Ale.  The water and Ginger Ale were fine.  The Bud Light had no foam/head on it at all.  Completely FLAT.  It looked like apple juice.  After explaining this to the waiter, he offered to put some salt in it to \"make it foam.\"  What?!  He brought back another draft beer that looked the same as the first.  That one was sent back as well.  We requested a bottled beer, as it was clear that something was wrong with the draft.   Either there was no CO2 or the glass was soapy.  A side note, the bottled beer was lukewarm.  After another person in our party tried the Shirley Temple, we knew we had encountered another problem.  IT HAD LIQUOR.   A Shirley Temple does NOT have liquor!  Although the person consuming it was over the age of 21, a non-alcoholic beverage was NOT ordered nor desired.  The waiter confirmed that it was made with Gin. GIN?!    The Shirley Temple was sent back and a Sprite arrived 5 minutes later.  FOOD:  We ordered:  mac and cheese balls, chicken wings, potato skins and a chicken quesadilla.    The food arrived within a reasonable amount of time.  It was all lukewarm.  It was all lacking in flavor.    The potato skins looked good but did not match the description.  The description said, \"potato skins loaded with house smoked brisket and chili and topped with sharp cheddar cheese.\"  THERE WAS NO BRISKET ON THE POTATO SKINS.  Also, the chili was really gross on the potato skin.  The skins had sour cream drizzled across them.  It would have been better on the side, not all over the top for folks that have allergies.  Mac and cheese balls were average.  The chicken wings were average.  The quesadilla was fair because the chicken inside was dry).    There were quite a few employees just standing around, yet the service was abysmal.  We were never offered a discount after the drink disaster or the delays.  Never so much as an, \"I'm sorry.\"   Interesting note:  the couple at the table next to us had difficulty as well.  We overheard the first beer being sent back and complaints about their food (pulled pork was apparently dry).  They were waiting for friends to meet them at the restaurant and actually called the friends and told them not to come.  We would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.  There are obviously quite a few issues with this place.  Hopefully this experience will be reviewed by management and appropriate changes made.  If not, I don't see this place lasting 6 months.  What a disappointment!"}
{"text":"This place is dope as fuck. Service is really good and prices aren't bad. Military discounts on drinks!"}
{"text":"If you want to hear current music, do NOT COME HERE! The music selection is absolute garbage and the  \"DJ\" has no skills. I was looking for a fun night out with my girlfriends where we could dance and enjoy ourselves. But for majority of the time just ended up looking at each other like \"what are they playing?!\" It was REALLY bad. Do not go here if you're looking for \"nightclub\" atmosphere. They're more of a play pool, without the pool table type of business. Sad."}
{"text":"There were six of us. We all ordered different meals and they were all great. The pulled pork , hamburger and fish and chips were outstanding."}
{"text":"Service is great! Food is yummy and kitchen was quick.  I would give 5 stars if the price was better. My husband had a t-bone which came with mashed potatoes (only) for $24. He was disappointed that he didn't get any type of vegetable or maybe even a salad. A side salad is $4 extra...really? Come on! I had the chicken poblano for $14.95. It was a lot of food and super delicious. My husband ended up finishing my meal. :)  the passion fruit iced tea is delicious and is unsweetened...right up my alley. Anyway, we are finishing it off with a hot cabin cookie. Yum! Give this place a try but you'll have to come after payday."}
{"text":"Really good food.. Service was on point and I will go back. I had the Blue burger and it was great. Brandy was my server and she was fast and always asked if I needed anything!!"}
{"text":"Been here several times. Finally a month in they have a drink menu. Never have the servers been able to tell me specials or prices off the top of their head. People on budgets like to have a nice night out too. Not all of us have bottomless pockets. Prices help. Should hire girls for knowledge and a little less for tit. I want this place to succeed cause I love whisky. Yet I see house drinks tailored for semi educated and low tolerant tastes. Have to say though, the food comes out quick and hot and delicious. Given em 2 stars. Owners, I hope you're paying attention to this and the other establishments in the area and general age group and income. Do NOT become another whisky rose and lose your identity."}
{"text":"Great service from the get go. Love Happy Hour pricing on appetizers and drinks. Daughter loved the Brownie sundae for dessert!"}
{"text":"Just ate at Cabin Whiskey & grill. I had the Cajun Shrimp Chicken Pasta and it was maybe the best pasta I've ever had. Our server Janessa was awesome. I've read the reviews and almost didn't come but am very glad I did. I will definitely be back again and again."}
{"text":"I heard they had amazing taco Tuesday's so I had to try it out. I went there and I must say it was amazing. Not only do they have a great selection on tacos but they have a lot of cool things on their menu that other restaurants do not. They also have trivia on Tuesday's so you have a chance to win a $25 gift card! It was so much fun! I will always recommend this place :)"}
{"text":"Burger was great and service at the bar was good.. need to figure a better system for people checking in--- hostess said come in 20 min and check to see-- not the norm-- we ended up eating at the bar as bartender was very friendly and attentive!!?"}
{"text":"Came here last week and the place was slow. First thing I noticed is the big shop doors there and how dirty they were. Looking around it seemed the floor and the rest was pretty dirty, don't they ever clean here? How dirty is the kitchen? I reluctantly ordered a drink and app the potato skins tasted funny like bad, spoiled something. I definitely will avoid here at all costs till it cleans up a lot"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what is happening to this place.  It appears to be going through some changes, and NOT for the better.  We were here last night 4/19 at about 8:30pm with my husband, my dad and my dad's girlfriend.  The place was pretty much empty inside.  A handful of people out on the patio listening to a terrible band.  We started off with drinks, a small Coorslight, a large Coorslight, a Modelo and a Guiness Blonde.  The server came back about 5 minutes later to let us know they no longer had Modelo and wanted to make sure I knew the Guiness Blonde was in a bottle.  Dad switched to a Kiltlifter.  She brings our beer, and I end up with Guiness Foreign Exchange?!  It was actually pretty good, so I kept my mouth shut and didn't send it back.  I assumed they no longer had Guiness Blonde either as the Foreign Exchange is not on the menu so I figured it was probably a swap out.  I ordered Fish Tacos as did my dad's girlfriend, my dad ordered Cajun Pasta and my husband ordered a Meatball Sub with Fries.  The food was actually pretty good.  The Tacos are tiny \"street tacos\" but packed with flavor.  My husbands sub looked good, but he couldn't eat the bread because it was either stale or over baked.  It was so hard you couldn't even bite into it.  The meatballs were pretty good though so he just ate the meat.  The service was pretty sub par as well.  We saw our server when we ordered, and again when she brought the drinks.  Someone else brought our food, server showed up over half way through our food and asked if we needed boxes.  My dad asked for one and the check.  It took another 10 minutes for the box and check.   When we got our bill my husbands beer was $11.50, yet the menu said $4.00!!  I politely brought it to the servers attention and she said, \"Oh yeah, we used to do that all night but we don't anymore.  It stops at 7pm now.\"  Ohhhh, well that may have been nice to know when you took our drink order and saw us ordering off the menu that was displayed on the table!  If you advertise something you should honor it; or better yet, DON'T ADVERTISE IT!  This place is a hike for my husband and I to get to, because we live in the Desert Ridge area, I can say with confidence we most likely will not be returning.  There are a ton of restaurants to eat at and have a good time, don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"Awful all the way around.  50.00 for two appetizer supposedly half price, and four tap beers.  Food was just mediocre if that. Bad bad service, girls hardly dressed might as well have been nude. More like trying to sell there bodies than food or drink. Will not recommend to anyone, and will never go back.  Only 1/2 star rating if that.  To many other really good places in the area."}
{"text":"Swung in on an impromptu visit on a Friday night around 7. It was busy as I imagined and the patio was full but were able to be immediately seated inside. We got a nice big booth and were greeted by our waiter right away. The inside of this place has a great ambiance to it and was much larger than I had expected.   I ordered a glass of wine and my husband ordered a bloody mary. It was brought out quickly which I always appreciate. The menu is pretty good, they seem to have a decent variety but I would like to see a little more options. Some of the items seemed to be repeated on each page (ie. chicken skewers, beef skewers, shrimp skewers). I ordered the shrimp tacos and my husband got the BLT.  The BLT came and it was ginormous with loads of bacon. I was a bit jealous. The shrimp tacos looked pretty lonely on the plate as this is all you got was the 3 tacos. My husband said the BLT was great, I had a piece of bacon and can confirm. My tacos were pretty good. The fish was nice and flaky, the batter was nicely done, and the sauce was delicious and had a little kick to it. I would have liked to see a little more ingredients on the tacos and perhaps some sort of side but then they were good enough that I would order again.  I will be back. Definitely would like to try out some of the other menu options they have and would love to get out to the patio."}
{"text":"Is awesome place, food is really good and service is exceptional. Good music and people is really nice."}
{"text":"Dopest spot on a Thursday night!!!omg soooooo many sexy ass women! If you looking for cheap drinks and sexy woman of all race make sure you pull up at the cabin! Thursday night"}
{"text":"We have been here several times bc we live so close, usually the food and service are great, but I'm super disappointed in them at the present. My spousal equivalent and I needed a bite and a few drinks around 9pm on Monday night. I knew it was later and a Monday so I called them to make sure they were still serving food, the woman on the phone said the kitchen would be open until 10pm. We were glad bc we only live 7 minutes away. We arrived at 9:17 and waited for about 4 minutes at the hostess stand while the bartenders just stared at us. Finally two bussers came up and just looked at us... I guess it's the patrons responsibility to speak first on Mondays after 9pm? Anyways, they asked if they could help us and I probs looked hella annoyed and was like, \"Yeah. We want to eat.\" (Duh). One of them said, \"Oh the kitchens closed.\"  I said, \"Hmm that's funny bc I literally called 10 min ago and the girl I spoke to said the kitchen would be open until 10.\" They both looked fakely shocked and said sorry. It was a disingenuous apology, whatever. They're lucky to get 3 stars from me. I'll most likely go back but I hope a manager or better yet, the owner reads this review... needless to say we ended up at Fleming's, which is never a bad place to end up."}
{"text":"Went here for a girls night with 7 other ladies. The service was fantastic!! We never had an empty glass . Our group ordered the bruschetta, chicken wings, French fries, Cajun pasta, enchiladas, and carne asada tacos. Everyone loved their food! My only complaint would be the price. The food seems a little expensive to me, for what you get. But all and all, we will probably go back again soon."}
{"text":"Very cool place to go on a Sunday. Great deals on appetizers and drinks. My wife and I try to go every Sunday for a a few too many drinks and a couple apps. Bartenders and servers are always friendly and helpful. The outdoor bar is very cool for big parties as well!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, very small portions for the prices, the three fish tacos were a joke for 11.00, the piece of fish was pinky finger size and the small tortillas,  one and done ! No wonder they have a Groupon, I'll go elsewhere next time."}
{"text":"Two years later and just watched a group of three wait at the bar for drinks while the outgoing bartender collected tabs because she's leaving and the incoming bartender looked into the horizon oblivious to new guests.  Love the atmosphere, but the bartenders on Saturday afternoons are awful.  The group of three left without getting served..."}
{"text":"Alsays the best food. Never had ANYTHING that was not tasty! Always a good place for a mean and a great brew mm"}
{"text":"First off if I could put a negative one I would. The guy was a white guy I was coming back in with my black friends and he said we were drunk. We're weren't. We tried going back in and he didn't let us. I'm from Cali first time I ever felt discriminated only in cali. I'm never coming back."}
{"text":"Excellent again. Service was the best I have had there and staff was very professional. Tried the crab cakes and they were so good we ordered a second round. Can't wait to go back. Keep up the great efforts."}
{"text":"This place deserves (-) stars. If the owners want this place to survive, they should get rid of their rude staff.  I stopped by for a drink with my cousins who were visiting out if town. We went bar hopping after a suns game in downtown Phoenix then decided to stop here on the way home to check this place out. The place was rather empty. We were turned down at the door because one of my cousins was casually dressed for the game. He wasn't planning on bar hopping but still he looked way more presentable then the sloppy looking, unprofessional guy at the door and we had absolutely no problems at other bars we went to. I will never step foot in this place again. It ruined my last night out with my cousins in town for absolutely no good reason. I know now why their parking lot was so empty at 1 am on a Friday night and I am looking forward for this place to shut down."}
{"text":"OK so I came here for my sons graduation! We arrive with 24 people minimum and they killed it! Mr. Patrick a new manager here at this spot just was amazing! Angelica amazing she was feeling every avoid that there was all day long! This place rocks tenfold if you don't know anything about hosting a 20for a group of people on the latest and shortest notice trust me you don't know what you're missing! This place is fabulous! So in the end it's beautiful the ambience is amazing and sexy the wood everywhere gives you that outside in the forest feel and the service is impeccable! You have to come here no joke Angelica rocks! Mr. Patrick prime time!"}
{"text":"Three stars because Happy hour offered some great deals.   The waitress was still learning the menu and deals because she had to go double check before answering some of our questions.    I don't know how to explain it but the ambience of this place is off.  Maybe because it's still new and trying to figure things out.  The place is huge.  Almost two huge.  It doesn't have a cozy cabin feel.  They need to fix that.    Random but two of the restrooms were out of toilet seat liners and it was only 630pm.  So gross!  The appetizers were tasty but I just wasn't really impressed.  I will try it again in a few months after they work out the kinks of being a new restaurant."}
{"text":"Ok. Just to let you know before you read any longer, I dont think its my job to get the wait persons attention when I want somthing. There. If you agree read on, but if not then mabye you wont like it. Family outing to the Cabin. 12 people at long table. I see maybe 5 wait people walking around doing \"stuff\". I say \"stuff\" because there was 2 other tables besides ours so Im not sure what they were doing. We get seated at 1pm. 20min and the waiter asks me what I want to drink. Do you have a drink menu? I ask. No he says. Ok ill just have a soda. 20mins later I get my soda. Im getting hungry now so I want to order some food. 30 mins this time till he comes back around to ask what I want to eat. Maybe he is busy I say to myself so I look around and there is only one other table seated and 2 people at the bar, so no he is not busy atleast with customers. 40mins goes by and I get my crap cakes and my ribs. The food was ok..... I know better places to get what I got. I wouldnt go back. Its not a good place to go. It looks awful to. They tried the cabin theme but failed. Always go full cabin, not some half assed one. Cant wait to see them on bar rescue though."}
{"text":"Foods over priced but ok. We've been here a few times and it seems to just be worse every time. The most recent visit left me with a server that couldn't manage to every refill our chips and salsa. Our waitress was more concerned about flirting with the guys at the next table. The employees are constantly having conversations with each other in groups, and they are not quiet about their inappropriate work conversations. Both steaks were undercooked to top it off. This place is mediocre at best and feels more like a frat house or sorority house than a restaurant.   Skip it and go somewhere else. Anywhere else."}
{"text":"this place had the best drink specials and great service. They also have a great taco Tuesday. the staff is friendly and very attentive."}
{"text":"Staff was extremely friendly! Had so many suggestions about food and different drinks, and that's something I can appreciate! Their patio area was great will definitely be going back for drinks!"}
{"text":"Great place! We loved the ambiance! The place was pretty dead for a Sunday evening, but the live music was amazing! A young man was playing guitar solos with awesome covers of Tracy chapman and bob Marley. He's there every Sunday at 3pm we found out. We were excited to try the filet mignon, but we're actually disappointed when both of our steaks came out way overcooked. We normally never send food back but at $25 a piece we did feel it was necessary. The server was polite and said she would fix the problem immediately. A few minutes later the manager came over and agreed that our steaks were overcooked, apologized and said our meal was on him. I thought it was very nice to make us feel that we weren't just being picky and our complaint was justified. I know mistakes happen and when they are fixed with such generosity I insist on giving 5 stars. We will definitely be going back to see how the night crowd is!"}
{"text":"Had to check this place out after being at when it used to be a Sand Bar. The decor is fun like a log cabin. The food it way overpriced. The bathrooms smell horrible. The wait staff were super nice though and that is why I am giving it a 3 stars. We took the family and I don't think we will be back because it just cost way too muhc!"}
{"text":"Service was slow and food was nothing great. Definitely a weird atmosphere no decor to support the theme. Waitress carried their waitress books in the back of their pants between each order taken and between each guest they gave it to which doesn't seem sanitary at all."}
{"text":"After driving by this restaurant numerous times and admiring their really nice looking patio we finally decided to give it a try. We chose a warmer evening with a beautiful sunset.  But upon walking up we discovered the chairs (stools only) on the patio were hard metal and all high tops.  Having children with us and a couple who suffer chronic pain we unfortunately opted to sit inside.  This alone was a pretty big disappointment.  The patio was basically empty and would have made for a perfect setting for us but the stools were a huge deterrent. So we sat inside.  The ambiance was fun and different.  Being originally from Montana where cabins abound made me chuckle at the fact they turned a cabin into a bar/party place.  But it's a cute idea. The food was decent.  2 in our party ordered burgers and unfortunately both thought they were pretty tasteless.  Large, but tasteless.  I ordered a salad which was huge and really good.  The fettuccine Alfredo and fish and chips were also hits.  We started with chips and salsa and their salsa was good as well. The service was interesting.  I won't say it was bad but it was pretty disorganized.  Our server was acting strange all night, almost like she kept getting confused and/or didn't know what she was doing.  She kept forgetting things and when we reminded her she acted very troubled.  Super weird.  She was pretty forgetful, even giving us the wrong check and when we paid we put 2 credit cards in to pay but she charged it all on 1.  Just a series of kind of strange things with her.  But the manager came over to check on us and he was super friendly. I think I might come back and try again but I am not going to lie, the patio seating kind of turned me off."}
{"text":"A small feel here. Not too busy here on a Sunday night but I like it. 90's music is playing in the background which reminds me of my adolescence. I think I'll be coming back in the future."}
{"text":"This place deserves more than 3 stars. Appetizers are half off from 3-7 and they have great drink specials as well.  Food is good and wait staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Everything is usually great here so I will give 3 stars,but today some guy is at the bar spitting tobacco into a plastic cup. GROSS..the bartenders don't seem to care. I lost my appetite.."}
{"text":"Ordered the crab cakes appetizer for $11.95. Shouldn't a restaurant TELL you when their \"crab\" cakes are actually \"krab\" cakes? I was very disappointed by the minced pieces of whitefish overwhelmed by mayo, red peppers, green onions, and spices. In addition, our server assumed that we had left her 24% and didn't bring our change until we asked for it."}
{"text":"This place a good food and a large selection. Two very large bars with one being out side. Last time I was here they said it was not dog friendly. Great selection of whiskey and beer too. Burgers are very good. Worth a try."}
{"text":"This place was awesome, I went at night sometime last year and I had fun as well as a few drinks (before I told myself I won't be drinking anymore). The bartender was really cool and nice, he was on top of my drinks the whole time. Recommend coming here with some friends, I was alone but still had a good time."}
{"text":"*UPDATE*  I called Thursday 3/23 to speak to the GM Eric. He was too busy to take my call, understandable, so I left my phone number and asked that he return my call Friday. It's now Saturday and still no call. Incredibly unprofessional & horrible customer service! No party planning at this place ever again!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I  have visited this place for there late night party atmosphere but had not check out the food.  We arrived at 730 the hostess opened the door for us and gave us a warm greeting, we were sat right away. Our service was really good, server was on top of our needs. The food was also really good and did not take long to arrive. Both dishes where well presented and hot and fresh. Price was fair, I felt I received my money worth. Overall I would recommend this place and will be back again."}
{"text":"The place was ok, but I'm still giving it 5 stars because I didn't really have anything to complain about.  The prices were fair and I want to go back to take advantage of the beer selection.   Between the appetizers and food, it was good but, there wasn't anything that set them apart from the rest.  The service was really good and friendly staff overall."}
{"text":"Came into town for a game and decided to go to this place for dinner the night before...it was a little concerning when we walked up on a Sunday night when there is football on and there were maybe 25 people there....once we sat down we were then only ones inside that's not a big deal though.  We ordered a couple drinks and I ordered a beer off the menu that was hand written above the bar and they didn't have a few of the beers that were still listed so,i just asked what they had and got the first thing I recognized . After I finished my beer I ordered a mint julep. Now being at a whiskey bar I figured this wasn't going to be a problem. But the waitress came back and told me they couldn't do a mint julep. A little shocked but I just asked for a jack Daniels Lynchburg lemonade....she couldn't do that either. So apparently they didn't have jack Daniels lemonade and triple sec..asked her what whiskey coctails they had and apparently they only had one at the time.so I just ordered the same beer that I got because I knew they had it...ok so the food was good I ordered the parmesan encrusted chicken. Nothing I would say was amazing but I left full. Then we ordered desert and I wanted the brownie...but guess what they were out of that. The manager was great and bought us dessert. It looks like there's new management and they are still getting there stuff together. I'd give this place a few months before giving it a try."}
{"text":"Nice patio atmosphere with live entertainment. Have been there for breakfast lunch but this time we did happy hour at sunset. The food was good with a great variety. The service was poor this time but it was the first time we experienced that. We waited over 30 minutes for drinks that we ordered before happy hour ended. We were charged regular price for the drinks and when we complained they fixed it but proceeded to add drinks that we didn't have (maybe to make up the difference?) We had to send the bill back twice to get it right. I wonder if it changed owners or something. They were asking for plates and menus because they were out of them but it wasn't even crowded. Overall a nice atmosphere and good food prices about the same as similar establishments."}
{"text":"After recently purchasing a group on to join friends for dinner I was a little worried about visiting here.   Contrary to many of the reviews read our experience was excellent.   We had the torpedos , the avocado egg rolls and the calamari and thoroughly enjoyed them them all.  This was then followed by entres off of the eclectic menu including the black bean burger, the Cajun pasta and the flat iron and we all were very satisfied.  We met the manager Richard who went out of his way to impress and assist us in finding the best scotch.  We were amazed by AJ, the live music and our waitress also McKenna was very attentive.  I would highly recommend if you have been here in the past to give this place a second chance!"}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken Yucatan salad. It looked delicious. the chicken they use on it was tasteless shredded chicken breast. That made the salad bland. a little too many onions. Wings had a good taste but were average. Service was good. I liked the atmosphere (came on a weekday lunch time) I hear it gets real busy at night."}
{"text":"This place was really new, they just opened on the 23 of January so they were a little slow, but the food is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place several times now and have been pretty happy overall. Atmosphere is fun, service is good, and their happy hour prices are great! I definitely recommend trying their coconut macadamia chicken skewers and street tacos. I wasn't impressed with their burger because it didn't have much flavor and came out burnt. I definitely didn't like their mashed potatoes so don't waste your time trying them. Besides that I've been happy with the other food here so I would recommend giving it a try!"}
{"text":"Torpedoes are the bomb... no pun intended! Husband had the BLT and it was amazing!!!  We eat here more than we should...#adventureswithmrmckee #cabinwhiskeyandgrill"}
{"text":"So let me start out by saying I am not old... I don't look old nor do I usually feel old. This is the one place that made me feel extremely old and for it to actually be inappropriate for me to be in a bar at my age lol. I haven't even hit the  30  Yet..  This place is FILLED with a bunch of 21 year olds which is an obvious as soon as you get passed the bouncer. I'm not judging 21 year olds but I'm judging some of their behaviors (ha makes me sound old).   Anyway as far as the place as a whole it isn't bad and their happy hour is great. Passed 9 or 10 it's $3 drinks, this was a Friday so I don't know if they do that on weekends also. The bartenders are super cool and attentive and give more than they should. In the bathrooms like most clubs they have a person who tries to hand you paper towels or hair ties (really anything so you can tip them). I am not sure about the dress code either because there were alot of people wearing baseball hats and sneakers/t-shirts. Didn't try the food so I don't know about that. It was fun but won't be back. I prefer Westgate or downtown Scottsdale."}
{"text":"We are from out of state & happened upon \"The Cabin\"  the decor & vibe here are super cool. The food was delicious, service by Amber was A+++, Mark the restaurant manager was awesome!! He hand decorated a cheesecake ice for my niece & she enjoyed when he presented it to her!  We had the  pulled pork sandwich, hog & heifer burger, fettuccine Alfredo, turkey burger. The deserts we ordered were the ice cream brownie sundae, cheesecake, & chocolate skillet cookie w/ice cream. Yum, yum, yum, we will definitely return next time we pass through AZ."}
{"text":"Appetizers were too greasy. Ordered the chicken skewers with no rice. No where on the menu does it state these are drizzled with some concoction of butter and mustard. I sent them back. At least I had a couple of good beers."}
{"text":"This place is growing on me. I had a starter of chicken wings followed by the Bacon loaded BLT. Food and service was on point. I will be back and to get 5 stars they need to cut back a little on the high volume of their tv's. Try it you will like it..."}
{"text":"Slow Wednesday night, so we were seated right away.  Way too cold, but otherwise the restaurant was clean and attractive.  Initial service was prompt, but slowed as the evening progressed, because our server was assigned to outside and inside, which were on totally opposite sides of the restaurant.  She (McKenna) was good when we could get her attention, but due to the bar in the middle, that was difficult.  She was running all over the place, so this was not the case at all of a poor server.  She just got stuck trying to be in two places at once.  Monterey burger was very good , as was the chicken poblano.  Burger a good size meal, but the chicken could have been larger - the addition of some roasted veggies would have made it the perfect size.  Burger was not cooked medium (too pink), which we mentioned to our server to let the cook know not to rush things next time.  We told her it was fine and no need to get anyone in \"trouble\", but the manager (Nick) came over later with dessert as an apology.  Not expected or necessary, but very much appreciated.  The brownie, by the way, is tasty...someone finally put enough ice cream on a dessert to go with the main ingredient!  Overall a good experience.  Suggestions:  get rid of the black menu pages (hard to read), add some food pictures for interest and show the \"flavor\" of your food, and make it clearer on the menu what you get with your meal other than the meat; raise the restaurant temp on slow nights; be sure the server isn't stretched from one side to the other - not fair to them; and get rid of the skimpy shorts.  Nothing like a bare upper thigh at eye level (the booth seating is very low to the ground) when you are seated to make a married couple uncomfortable!  I'm sure we'll be back.   EDIT:  Forgot to mention...the cool looking motorcycle thing at the front door was neat, but hard to maneuver around when walking down the sidewalk.  Probably not a great place to park it...someone needing assistance walking would not have been able to get through easily."}
{"text":"Decent happy hour specials if you're feeling greasy food! Great drinks specials for happy hour as well."}
{"text":"Summary: In a plaza that has seen much better establishments fail, it is a cosmic injustice that a bar & grill like this can exist for so long.   As the rest of the far west continues to develop their own unique options, some argue Park(e) West is struggling to maintain relevancy. Establishments from several years ago have already packed their bags. And while it's fortunate other restaurateurs are attempting to upcycle these spaces into something more worthwhile, I'm afraid this could join the long list of failed projects.   Cabin used to be Sandbar. They kept the outdoor bar and the large patio, but traded the sand for more wooden fixtures. Beyond that, literally nothing else was invested in atmosphere.That's not something I'll get riled up over, but I just have to point out that not trying is really a reoccurring theme here.   The menu doesn't really excite me. They boast \"whiskey & grill\" in the name, but if it weren't for their website, I'd never known they had an expansive whiskey selection. There were no advertisements for it, and I hadn't seen it on a physical menu. In fact, options for their signature drinks or craft beer bottles were never visible to me. That is a problem.   As for food, the menu seems to be really big on a variety of tacos and steaks. I went with a classic pub favorite--the calamari. The familiar chili sauce it came with indicates the menu does borrow from its predecessor. But...this was the worst calamari I'd had--they looked and tasted like just plain fish sticks TBH. I couldn't even finish half, and after sampling it themselves, my friends were in no hurry to indulge either. Yikes! When incredibly simple dishes are terrible, what confidence can you have for the product of actual creativity in the kitchen?  There are plenty of decent dining options nearby, and I wasn't really going there for the food, so this isn't even what gets me the most. The service here is just absolutely flat out terrible. Despite having several tables reserved for about 20 people, any servers were done for the night well over an hour before the kitchen closed. This led to quite a few of us waiting around awkwardly and empty handed, never being asked so much as what we wanted to drink. I had to request a menu.  After spending a few more hours here between my visits, I see why it's all moving so slow. Despite dozens of customers, Cabin tries its hardest to rely on one bartender doing all the work. The barbacks don't ease the workload by handling the simple tasks, like fetching beers or cleaning up. So...what are they doing? They chill out and play beer pong with security and customers for most of their shift. I am not the first reviewer to notice this. And don't get me wrong, I appreciate a laid-back work environment, and I don't want to rain on anyone's parade, but management at some point needs to understand that it can *not* come at the expense of the customer experience. Even worse, it looks terrible to have the women (which AFAIK all their bartenders are) busting their asses while the guys literally play around through their entire shift. Slobs.   In the end, the only bright spot here was the bartender during my first visit in early May. Despite being inundated with work, she was positive the entire time, looked like she cared, and wasn't being a jerk--all while having the misfortune of working on her birthday. She's too good for this place. I hope she reads this review, realizes this is a sinking ship, and gets out before it's too late.   I have absolutely no reason to return."}
{"text":"This place was just ok. Our Mac and cheese bites tasted burnt and the waitress didn't seem to care, which was disappointing. Food wasn't bad, but I don't have a desire to go back. They have trivia nights which seem fun, but overall the place isn't that special. Shortly after this review they did reach out, which I found very respectable and proactive. Sounds like they're fixing the Mac and cheese bites, so if they continue to be proactive as they say things will hopefully improve."}
{"text":"Love this place, have been going here since it opened. I love taco Tuesdays, happy hours, and all the night life. The staff, the food, and the atmosphere are all top notch. Give it a shot, you won't be dissapointed."}
{"text":"I appreciate your response. We really were hoping to find a great place to head to on the weekends to grab a bite and a few drinks. We are also looking for that sweet spot to take friends to that has that \"local\" bar feel. While the bar is the fee we ware looking for, like outside eating with musters and cornhole, the seafood options and pricing for those in comparison to the quality was not equivalent. I don't mind paying those prices if the food is delicious.  I can say the reason you got any stars at all was because the waitress and guy who brought out our food were both on point and friendly. We also had a mixup on our tab, which management corrected. Atmosphere was fantastic and loved the Cabin look. We'd love to come back and give you another shot should we be able to have better quality food.  Seriously though, that OIL needs changed BADLY."}
{"text":"This place sucks ordered 3 $2.50 cranberry vodkas ended up getting charged $30 some BS"}
{"text":"Ordered the korean tacos, not really an entree, more like an app- only comes with 3 small tacos. Jalapeño torpedoes were pretty good, it comes with 4.  We also tried the chips and salsa which I don't recommend, the salsa was more like a marinara sauce than an authentic salsa. The recommended chicken salad was pretty bland. Good service but overall just okay."}
{"text":"This was our first time visiting Cabin Whiskey Grill. We arrived just before 5pm on a Saturday. A hostess seated us, and that's when there were some missteps. We weren't supplied a drink menu or any utensils, and then had to wait about 10 minutes to meet our server. I asked for the additional menu, and my husband eventually had to grab utensil bundles from the hostess stand. Once we met our server, though, our food was brought out at a good pace and she checked on us often.  We were seated at a table indoors but right at the edge by the patio. It was a lovely evening. The atmosphere was quite nice. Unlike some places, it was not horribly loud, even though we were between the patio and the bar.  The kitchen here is fantastic. We ordered the Famous Cabin Torpedoes for an appetizer: jalapenoes stuffed with pepperjack cheese and brisket, then wrapped in bacon. These were REALLY good. I can't do really spicy food, but I could do these! They had flavor, not scorching heat.  My husband had a ribeye and fries. He was impressed with how they cooked the ribeye--and he's picky about that.  I had a margarita (okay, nothing extraordinary) and Korean tacos. Again, I was impressed. Some restaurants use leftover meat for things like tacos. That was not the case here. The pan-seared steak was incredibly fresh and tender. I tried a dab of the accompanying sauce and found it waaaaaay too spicy, so I was a little worried that the tacos might be dry. Nope. The meat along with the slaw topping and some ginger was just perfect. Better than expected.  Our son had the kid entree with macaroni and fries, and he enjoyed it all. I had a bite of the macaroni and cheese, and thought it was good. We were supplied a container to take the last portion home.  Even though we kind of had to fend for ourselves at the start, the cook left us quite impressed. We'd go back for sure."}
{"text":"Had a fun night here. We reserved a table outside but it was too cold so they moved us inside right away, no problem. This place reminded me of Saddle Ranch, big and open with a mix of people and music. We came on a Friday, but I heard Thursday's are the best. Staff was friendly. Shout out to the hot dog guy outside... Hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Our waitress came to the table once in 30 minutes after I asked to speak with the manager about the lack of service. He apologized and said he would take care of it. The bill came and there was a card for a free appetizer, but we live in Ohio. Our bill came and I was charged extra for a side of sauce because the one that came wish the dish was not good.   Long story short: terrible service, poor management, and mediocre food. All the waitresses were attractive which the only reason I think mine had/has a job ..."}
{"text":"I really really wanted to love this place. The outdoor area is awesome, drink selection is pretty good and it's a little classier than sandbar used to be . I have gone 4 times and I'm done its awful. The service is terrible ! Iv waited 30 minutes for a drink, the food and drinks almost never come out correct and the staff doesn't care at all. The waitresses started taking shots behind the bar the minute the owner ( who seemed like a very nice guy) left . Last night my food food came out way wrong , I sucked it up with the app but I couldn't eat my burger with gauc on it so she took that back comes back after everyone else is about done with a well done burger ( ordered medium rare) that's super dry and gross had 2 bites and I couldn't stomach it . They still charged me for the meal I clearly didn't touch. So if you are getting just drinks and want to enjoy the sunshine check it out with low expectations. For food I would not waste the money ."}
{"text":"I cant say anything wrong with going here. Been here a few times and have never had poor service or bad food. You cannot beat the happy hour specials! Today, the GM Erik was there, when he saw us looking around for our waitress  he came over to our table to make sure we were ok. Who does this anymore? Our waitress was great, Amber was her name . Very friendly and hustling around the place. Food was good as always."}
{"text":"Not a very good experience. Sucks because I live down the road.   First off i don't think it was particularly one persons fault and our waitress was doing the best she could with what she had.   My opinion, way over priced for the quality of food. My street tacos were marginal. Decent presentation meat was tender but the taste of the meat was weird. Almost reminded me of a burnt taste mixed with the smell of every meat cooler I've ever been in.   Service was off the chain slow. The group was very very hunger and each persons meal came out in spurts. Leaving me to look at everyone's food in jealousy. My appetizer was like the fifth plate to be served... for real though why are people getting burgers and dinner salads before i even see the order of wings i placed?   My personal favorite was the blonde curly headed **** dude. He serves a plate of humus with peta bread... the pits bread drops on the floor while he is setting it down... i try and tell him he dropped the bread. He clearly has no interest in what I'm trying to tell him... my aunt asks for more pita bread and the dude says \"idk you have a waitress for that you have to ask her\". What a joke.   For sure not a place i will return to for a Sunday meal."}
{"text":"I just went here with friends for Memorial Day weekend and albeit it WAS a Sunday the place was totally dead! Our group made up half of the people there.  The bartenders were moody and there were NO staff walking around to service anyone. The GM (or one of them) was busy playing beer pong. We had to ask to get in on a game. Unprofessional given your guests should be the priority.  This place seems like some guys long lost fantasy to own a bar. They named it the Cabin, threw up some logs and camo and it's supposed to be charming and rustic? Me thinks not!   This location used to be the Sandbar and when they were around it was always so busy and fun! Given that there isn't much on the west side I feel bad for the folks over there losing a place like Sandbar. Such a shame.  I would have to say the only plus about this place was the updated patio (no sand, no pool)."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant inside and out. We started off the amazing fried mac and cheese. Must get! My girl ordered and liked the cheese enchiladas a lot. The rice was good, refried beans tasted like they were from a can. I ordered the Cabin burger with bacon. I said medium well and the burger was cooked well done. The bacon was burnt! I don't like it too crispy. The burger was below average. The fries were excellent! Made and seasoned very well. We ordered the Cabin cookie which is a chocolate chip cookie with ice cream and whipped cream. It was good but nothing too special."}
{"text":"Went here a few months ago in the early afternoon before catching a movie for a few drinks. It was pretty slow and there was nothing that stood out about this place. The service was okay and I didn't try the food but I doubt I will return because there are so many other places that are more unique to try."}
{"text":"Decided to come here on a Tuesday night. Wasn't aware that they do Taco Tuesdays here but I'm not complaining. The dim lighting, cool and relaxed feel helped set the peaceful ambience of the restaurant. The reggae music playing also helped set the mood. Gave their tacos a try since they were on special and I have to say out of all the tacos the torpedo taco was hands down the best. Just had an explosion of flavors that complimented each other well. Reasonably priced for the night and went well with their 1800 Margarita to wash it all down. Their margarita was a 10/10. and I highly recommend them. Just the right amounts of sweetness and alcohol. Customer service was all on point and overall I would recommend this restaurant to anyone I know."}
{"text":"This place is SO cool! They have a reggae-esk band tonight and a good friendly crowd and super helpful and cheery barstaff. We ordered entrees and have full confidence this place won't disappoint. Thanks for a great night out guys!!!"}
{"text":"The hostess at the entrance was as rude as I have ever seen a person. It is clear that she's not meant for customer service and I have no idea what she was doing there. If they had name tags, I didn't notice or I would mention her specifically. Strangely there are 4 girls sitting at the hostess area doing mostly nothing while the wait staff is busy waiting on customers. As a group, they clearly did not like having their conversation interrupted by paying customers. Once we were seated, the waiter was efficient and attentive. I have no complaints. The food was a little strange the avocado egg rolls that people rave about; I am not a fan. The middle of the thing is tasty but there is just too much avocado and egg roll skin...very very rich. However the Korean Street Tacos were delicious, chips and salsa were good and The BLT is phenomenal. We will go back and try more of the food and I'm curious to find out if their rudeness at the front door continues."}
{"text":"Well, the one star is for the service and the service alone! I read the reviews and thought REALLY PEOPLE - why be so negative. Well, I am sorry YOU WERE RIGHT. Friends were already seated and had their drinks. Over 10 minutes until someone came to the table. Ordered drinks and a humus platter... and over 10 minutes later the drinks arrived... 20 minutes later- friends had finished their calamari (yes that would be a cooked appetizer) and we were still waiting for our UNCOOKED, THROW IT IN A BOWL humus. Then... it was delivered to the wrong table. The final straw... hubs ordered coffee... no regular coffee it will take 3 minutes over 10 minutes later a luke warm cup of coffee NO sugar NO creamer was brought with it. The server seemed a little perturbed when I followed her back to the kitchen to get the creamer and sugar.   Pretty sure I would NOT return!!! Over 50$ to be ignored... not worth it. Cannot wait to see what goes in this space next!!!"}
{"text":"Slowest service ever. Food was okay. Atmosphere was cozy though."}
{"text":"I'm so Happy this place is here! The food was great and the service was exceptional. Viri was our waitress, and she did an incredible job. My husband and I came and brought our 7 year old, and I was pleasantly surprised to see that they had a children's menu, with all the favorites kids could enjoy.   Let me tell you. The Cabin Mac n' Cheese was epic. Loaded with different cheeses and bacon! It was a perfect portion, and full of flavor. My husband had the BBQ burger and really enjoyed it as well.   We will for sure be returning. This place was good for dinner, and seems like it would be a lot of fun to enjoy during a girls night out. They appeared to have a full bar, and plenty of room for dancing also.   One of the ladies from the management team even came by to ask about our experience, and that goes a long way with me! Kudos to the staff here! Keep up the great service and you'll be spot on!"}
{"text":"Came in on a Wednesday night (last night) and was seated right away.  That pretty much sums up out visit.  We waited in a fairly empty restaurant and saw a waiter walk past us a few times.  We left without anyone coming to our table about 15 minutes later."}
{"text":"First time here. Service was okay.  Food needs work.  Seated at a table that was still dirty.  Hostess took care of it though. Ordered unlimited chips and salsa.  Good flavor. Noticed that they had Blue Moon battered cod on the menu.   Ordered a Blue Moon to drink -- they didn't serve Blue Moon...huh?  Wife ordered iced tea...they ran out of regular iced tea.  Ummm... there's a Safeway right down the road.  Want the recipe for iced tea? Ordered salad for before meal.  Didn't come until after dinner and after we asked for it.  however, we were charged twice for it. Got the Cabin Burger medium-rare -- one of their half-pound burgers.  Good char on the outside, right temperature, but lacked seasoning.  When a restaurant creates these BIG burgers you've got to season the meat so the customer doesn't have to disassemble them. Onion rings were soggy, but French fries were good.    Asked the waitress -- of Cabin Whiskey and Grill -  how much a shot of Jack Daniels cost (one of the more popular blue-collar bourbons).  She said $4.50 or $6.  I asked which it was, but she didn't know, so she checked.  It is $6.50.    A change in leadership or leadership style might be needed to help this restaurant survive.  They are quickly becoming the next Toby Keith's bar and grill.  I don't think they'll survive another year.  I know I won't be contributing any more money toward their survival."}
{"text":"I was recently there to celebrate my big brothers bday. I called in to make 2 table reservations for a Saturday night for up to 15 people. I called in the reservation Thursday, May 17th and then asked about bottle service. The lady on the phone quoted me $50 because the were running a promotion that Friday and Saturday night, she said. I said great, please place me down for bottle service. She grabbed all my info and when I came on that Saturday, there were already issues. I came in at 9:55, five mins before the tables should have been ready. They told me I needed to just wait for someone to clean my table. We get to the tables and it still was not cleaned off (that took an additional 20 mins after I mentioned something). The other table was given to someone else because they accidentally overbooked and who ever made the reservation didn't pay attention. So then they apologized and it was fine, no big deal because we luckily had enough elbow room and the tables are pretty big outside. But then when it came to ordering my bottle, the waitress came and told me it would be $180. This poor waitress was going back and forth being the messenger lady all because the manager didn't want to come to the table to talk about this matter. She said if we wanted to talk to her to meet her at the bar. Really? Professionalism at its finest, right?! That alone was blasphemy to me. This all boils down to the lady who took my original request to a reservation with bottle service. The manager told the waitress to tell me that the reservation lady May have told this to me the week prior. But no, I called that week before the weekend even started. Complete BS! The waitress was so sweet and I felt so bad that the manager would place her employees under situations where a manager should be stepping in. We were not, by any means, happy campers towards her and I did apologize because it was not her fault."}
{"text":"I don't know what's with all the negative feedback. We came here on a Thursday night & it was steadily busy  the entire time. Inside & outside bar (which looks really cool) although we sat inside cause it's so dang hot but plenty of people filled the outside bar as well, about 3/4 of the tables were being used. Decor is cool, nothing crazy awesome, but cool enough to keep you looking around. Service was perfect, friendly, courteous, prompt, etc. The food was great too! Seriously people- don't let all the negatives scare you from trying it! And apparently they have live music on the weekends. What more could you want?!"}
{"text":"Preston and company hit it out of the park with Whiskey Rose but the Cabin needs some work.  Bar stools are awful.  Bar service inside was slow.  Didn't get the same service that I've become used to at WR.  Hopefully it improves.  I gave it 4 stars to bring up the average because the food was good and I have faith that the service will improve.  I'll try it again in the fall."}
{"text":"Underwhelming.  AMBIENCE: It's sad to be the only ones seated at the bar watching sports on a Saturday plus Hockey night when ALL of Westgate is packed as is BJs and about everywhere else. We loved this place when it was Sandbar and kinda giggled at the schlopy remodel. It's called Cabin but adding one textured wall and a fireplace does not give it a cabin feel. Even when stocked with appropriate beverages. Basically they just covered the tents with camouflage paper. And why keep the dreadful noisy metal orange bar chairs? There's a bit of a more mature crowd as well. Thankfully the dirty pool is gone. The space is more open. And with more open means more smoke smell coming inside. Eck. And I'm straining my neck to see the TV which has serious lights blinding me behind it. Check out the photos.  SERVICE: Exceptional. Delivery of food was rapid. They brought napkins/silverware before we asked but failed to bring appetizer plates. They asked us multiple, almost annoyingly often, times if we needed anything or wanted the bar tender to make us something.  FOOD: Sadly, a favorite was not cooked well and excuses were given. We only ordered a Cabin favorite which the bartender said was a given good time based on no one saying bad things about the dish at their other location. We had the FAMOUS Cabin Torpedoes (almost couldn't check the title bc my menu stuck together-YUCK!). The cheesy meaty filling was a strange texture but my hubby said it's just meat. The jalapeño still had a bit of a crunch which was nice but not redeemable. Some of the jalapeños even had a kick. The downfall was the lazy broiler method of cooking which rendered the bacon on the sides and bottom of the pepper to be very underdone and inedible. And the sauce? We're not sure why it was there and felt it didn't help the dish.  When asked how we liked it, I honestly said the bacon was too underdone for our liking. Bar tender shrugged it off that if they cooked it more then it's too crispy. Honey, did you not see that half the bacon remained on our plates and was inedible? Oh, and for you bacon-nados, I call chewy bacon on a  bar appetizer inedible. Bar food should be crispy, salty, well seasoned, and gooey. Fail fail fail.  The second app, chicken skewers took a little longer to come out but still very quickly delivered. I don't like when people just walk around with your food a little unsure where to take it but fortunately they found us quickly. The taste was alright. Sugary coconut with a sugar dipping sauce. I'll pass. We asked for some sort of hot sauce and were brought Tabasco.  Final food thought-why is every dish dusted with paprika and parsley. Like two nothings still do not equal a something.  Redeeming possibilities include well advertised Happy Hour M-F 3-7 with $2 domestics, $3 wells, and 1/2 price apps.  Plus a reverse HH Sun-Th 10-close with &2 domestic pints, $3 wine, $3 fireball, and 1/2 off apps. And finally the Thursday night specials $2 domestic pint, $3 whiskey sour, $3 fireball, and $4 bombers.   Another note to fellow ANONYMOUS YELPERS HARASSING ME because of this post. I don't think that helps my post or this business and other dinners should be aware of this harassment. MARISSA: I don't dine alone and 4-2=2 just to try a dish. RANDALL: this is a far stretch from fine dining-it's a dance bar that serves food.   I've been here more than once and tried multiple dishes that make no sense (tomato sauce with bruschetta?). I think 3 stars is fair and well supported in my review."}
{"text":"Really not to much different from when it was the sandbar. Can go have some fun, drink it up. Just be careful and make sure you don't try to drive home from here after drinking. There are cops all over this area. Be smart take a cab, uber, or whatever you prefer."}
{"text":"This place has great food and great atmosphere! They have happy hour M-F and all the apps are half off and even the beers! The staff is nice and friendly and always make sure you have what you need. I would defiantly recommend trying this place for the AMAZING food and Happy Hour! This inside of this place looks great as well! The manager had done just about everything inside himself! Check this place out for sure!"}
{"text":"So eight months later we decided to take the Management's invitation to come back in and see if things had changed. I did this anonymously so that the results would not be skewed.  We arrived about 7 p.m. and were promptly greeted and seated at a table of our choice. We again ordered the Torpedoes appetizer to start and it was done perfectly with crisp bacon on the outside and the brisket was flavorful.  For dinner we ordered a half rack of the barbecued ribs and the parmesan crusted chicken. The chicken was delicious and the server had recommended that we choose an unofficial option of having the sauce contain a more spicy version. It was very good. No shenanigans with the tables this time and a very good time. They have evidently gotten past their grand opening issues and IMO are an excellent dining choice now."}
{"text":"Cabin is too lit on a Thursday and good service I waited a lil bit too long for are bottle and they gave us a gift card and 10 shots of patron I recommend this please to anyone"}
{"text":"We had driven by the place once looking for a different restaurant and wanted to check it out. Brought friends and family in one night. Had reservations for 15 and table was ready when we arrived a few minutes early, even with the place already busy. Love the atmosphere and feel of the Cabin. A little loud for kids and family, where we sat but a great place, for great food. I don't drink myself, but others in our party really enjoyed the bar. Attentive wait staff, took really good care of us. But if you come for nothing else, come for the food! Everything from the potato skins to the burgers were awesome! We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"the worst place I have ever been Asian tacos Yeah right bad service worst beer mugs which they called 40 ounces of beer the 32 ounce beers get there before other customers and get served after them horrible wish I could give them less then one star"}
{"text":"We ordered BLT, Bleu Burger and kids menu Fettuccini Alfredo. Cheesecake to top it off! Great food and service. A country/cabin/hunting theme. More of a bar than a restaurant. Great experience!"}
{"text":"Didn't have a chance to try the food or drinks because the service was so bad. Seated right away and then basically ignored for 10 minutes then a  group came in and I said if they serve them before us I'm leaving. And guess what you guessed it they took they're order and walked right passed us.   Very disappointed   Ok so my first experience wasn't much of an experience at all so I decided to give this place another shot and I so glad I did! I have been back about 5 times now and every time has been outstanding the service the food and the drinks. Happy hour is by far the best deal in town 2.00 beers you guys Rock see you all soon."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible- besides a sweet server the bday dinner was ruined. Food horrible cold no flavor drinks from bar tender took over 15 min on a non busy Wednesday night I do not recommend at all!!!"}
{"text":"We went for the first time before a movie late on a Sunday night. We were greeted by the Manager who was very nice. Shook our hands and introduced himself. The bartender Cody was awesome. Very attentive! Even when he didn't respond to me looking over at him because I needed a refill he was very apologetic. \"So sorry I even saw you looking over!\" I didn't wait long at all. Will def go back. Great customer service."}
{"text":"Smiling staff that wants to help, but lacks training.  Had to ask for silverware and extra plate when we requested to split an entree.  Salad did not come with dressing.  Ordered flat iron steak that has a sour red wine sauce all over steak, but mashed potatoes were good."}
{"text":"Great food, good atmosphere a little loud but could still hold a conversation.  Had the iron skillet steak and chicken tortellini.  Steak had a very good marinade and the tortellini had a wonderful spinach sauce."}
{"text":"Went to Cabin Whiskey today for a painting event. Seated waited 22 minutes called over the manager, and took our order wrong doubling the size of my drink, then refusing to take it back. Food was cold and tasted horrible and only had a burger. The painting event was late and unprepared upon arrive. I do not recommend this establishment for any reason. Thank you. After posting this, the gentlemen who I asked for service came over said my review was unfair we were asked by a waitress if everything was fine we said yes, I said well what did you want me to say this has been confrontational from the time we asked for help. He apologized for drink size but said that's what he heard, said he wasn't charging us. He said I posted food was cold. I said it was the frys were. So... just wanted everyone to know how I was treated."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. Great happy hour and great prices. Disappointed because I went online and made a reservation. The manager called to confirm. When I showed up?  No reservation. When I asked to speak with the manager about it he totally avoided me.  He had two hours to finally come speak with me and he didn't bother to do so. Not the best first impression for sure."}
{"text":"Came here on Taco Tuesday, their tacos are pretty bomb!! (Except their couscous, it was super bland!). They have $3 Coronas, good deal. Had their chicken & shrimp fettuccine, it was well seasoned and creamy. Chicken was juicy. All the shrimp wasn't cleaned tho. Some were open and had the vein cleaned out and a big majority of others didn't. The server was great. Very attentive and on top of my table. Great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"We had a work function at The cabin last night and their service and food is a 10!!!! I would recommend this place to anyone!! Service was so good the manager greeted us several times and even helped taking the food out. I met both owners Preston and Donavon and they were very inviting and you can tell they had pride in their establishment. The alcohol was great pricing. Not only that, the food was amazing. We WILL be going their for ALL our work functions in the future. Great job guys!!"}
{"text":"I went there for lunch the other day and I did not enjoy the experience for a reason I won't disclose but when I talked to Eric the assistant GM about it, he was great, he apologized and offered me back for a better experience... Therefore, like  any industry, customer service is priority and he took that to heart as he was more than willing to address the issue so it doesn't happen again. I like the place and recommend it to anyone in the area who wants some good food and drinks in a great environment... I will be back."}
{"text":"The grilled salmon with rice and veggies was good. Muh Baby had the fish tacos and she enjoyed them.  We're enjoying some live music while we wait for a Cabin Cookie for dessert.  The service was good, food was good, would absolutely do this again."}
{"text":"First time here. Had the mahi mahi, the patty melt, chicken skewers. We loved it all! Fast service, our waitress was so sweet too! We will be back!"}
{"text":"The owner Preston us very engaged.  I had less than stellar service on tonight's occasion, but Preston quickly stepped in a made the evening very good."}
{"text":"When we were visiting the Glendale area, staying at a hotel, We went looking for a good place to eat. We went in to a very busy, packed place, but were seated immediately. Most of the crowd was on the patio, for Friday happy hours. The food was good, the portions were huge, and the service fast and friendly. I would go there again."}
{"text":"We have went here two times.  The happy hour is really good.  We've tried several appetizers and haven't been disappointed with any of them. The stuffed potatoes is probably our favorite. We've gone on Monday when it's less busy. The other days look like a lot more people. Staff has been great each time we've been there."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times, and I always get a different experience every time I go. The outdoor area is awesome, but they allow people,to smoke out there, so you do have to deal with that. In the past, this wouldn't be an issue for me (I don't smoke), but now that it's pretty much banned everywhere I am used to not smelling it or dealing with it, so it is startling to be around it.   They have a large selection of liquor here, and originally when I went they had a lot of bourbons, which I liked, but it seems that they have cut those options down (I understand it though cuz if it doesn't sell, your not gonna keep buying it).   My top two issues with this place is the food and the service. Some days the service is great, and others, it's mediocre. The food is just so so, not terrible, but not great.   In summary, it's a good place to grab a drink and hang out with friends, but it's just mediocre in general."}
