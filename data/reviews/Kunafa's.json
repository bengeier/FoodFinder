{"text":"Very good. My entire family is in love with this place. Very clean and very tasty, didn't expect it to be this good in Toronto."}
{"text":"Just inhaled 2 slices of Knafeh from here and they were amazing! Super fresh, fast and the staff were so friendly and helpful. Heard about this place via Instagram and it did not disappoint. The Nama slice was so cheesy, it had that sexy cheese pull you look for. The Kishna slice was perfectly crispy on top, the cheese had a nice \"squeak\" or resistance to it and it was slightly less sweet then the first slice (I love it sweet) but I could've easily had a second (or third) slice.

Ali and Basim (I'm assuming the owners) even cut us mini samples so we could snack on something delicious while our order was being packed up. The place had a lineup of people waiting on a Sunday evening so definitely a popular spot. Definitely coming back again (and again)!"}
{"text":"Very clean and modern design. Kunafa's does a great job at showcasing middle eastern desserts. The owners are very nice and catering, we ordered a classic Kunafa and ate it all before leaving the store. It was delicious. I just wish it was a little warmer but honestly that wasn't a big concern. 

I'll be back to enjoy their other dessert options for sure"}
{"text":"Walked out of Tim Hortons, straight into Kunafa heaven!

Kunafas don't get any better than this. The use of top quality ingredients is very evident.

I walked into the shop randomly, got myself 2 pieces of crispy kunafas called \"kishna\". Got home, baked it for 5 minutes to warm it up, first bite and i was teleported back to middle east.

It was perfectly sweetened, very crispy and they didn't hold back on the cheese.
We all liked it soo much that i was back the next day for some more.
It gets a little busy before sunset (breaking fast) time during these days, but it also means that after a bit of wait you'd get it straight from the oven.

If you have never had Kunafa before and don't know what it is, just do yourself a favour, hop by and grab a slice."}
