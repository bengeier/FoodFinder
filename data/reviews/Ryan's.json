{"text":"Very good service especially Coleen and the beautiful Ms Lisa.  Good salad bar with lots of different fresh vegetables and fresh fruit.  The Hot Food bar generally is pretty good with lots of  cooked vegetables to choose from and tasty biscuits.  Good deserts.  The restaurant does need remodeling especially the bathrooms and the carpeting.  Lunch is a good value. Coffee is pretty bad, other drinks are fine."}
{"text":"Ryan's provides great value for the money, but don't expect to eat a fine steak.  The buffet has a wide variety of decent tasting choices.  The service is friendly and efficient.  The steak is only offered as sirloin.  For the $10 price range, you couldn't expect much more."}
{"text":"Of buffets, I've never been to anything worse  Old Country Buffet (or OCB for those who have frequented there as children) could run circles around this place (if these buffets were running some kind of circular track race).   Food: 1. I sampled a little bit of everything except for the salad bar.  The salad bar looked super lame. And everything tasted like it had come out of a freezer and was immediately heated in hot oil.  Then saturated with salt. 2. To give you a point of reference, I ate meals from the dorms for four years.  The dorm food was better. significantly.  3. I will concede on one point- their steaks were actually not too bad.   Price: 1. $12.00 per person. (WHAAAA?- Just use your money on 2 Chipotle burritos).  2. Extra cost for drinks. I was tired and asked for a coffee. DONT make my mistake.  It was horribly awful. Worse than Mary Ann's.  3. Why would anyone pay this much money for this??  People: 1. So at buffets, the staff help take away plates and refill drinks. Did this happen at Ryan's? Uh like once. We had a stack of dishes waiting for 30 min to be taken away.  Which meant no one refilled our drinks or took away our dished for most of the meal.  2. I went with a group of young 20 people and we stuck out like sore thumbs.  Most of the people were older, whiter, and larger.     Ambiance: If you've ever gone to OCB, it's just like it.    Unless you like overpriced unappealing oversalted food, my suggestion is to skip Ryan's."}
{"text":"I took a group of eight here for a birthday lunch on Monday afternoon. We went because it was close, we had coupons and figured that, for the same price as Taco Bell, we could get a decent lunch. I didn't check Yelp reviews or look at the buffet before paying. My mistake!   This place is filthy, the food looks and tastes like it comes out of freezer bags and some of the temperatures had me worried. Seriously, the corn on the cob still had ice crystals on it! The odor from the dessert prep area caused several of us to lose our appetite and we left wishing we'd spent the money at Taco Bell.   I was disappointed because usually we have a good experience at Ryans and their sister buffets. I called their corporate office and complained. In their defense, the district manager did call me the next day to address our concerns. He said they would look into things and also were sending us some VIP passes so we could have another meal on them.   However, after reading reviews on this place from two and three years ago complaining about the same issues, I have a hard time believing its going to improve. So for now, it's eat at your own risk!"}
{"text":"Just walked in and am immediately IMMEDIATELY grossed out!!!!  But, my husband is tired and hungry so here we stay.  As I look around I see no less than 5 dirty unoccupied tables.  The one we're sitting at is sooooooo sticky I want them to wash it again (I'd they've ever washed itty in the first place I don't know)  gross.  The floors are filthy.  I'm refusing to eat even though he paid for it."}
{"text":"We stopped to eat at Ryan's one night after shopping all day at Concord Mills Mall.  Why?  We were hungry and Ryan's was the way to satisfy everyone.  They could pick whatever they wanted to off the buffet.    I don't visit buffets that often, but Ryan's has to be the grungiest one I've ever been to.  The food offerings were less and more bland than say Golden Corral, the place felt a little dirty, and the service was unspectacular.    It was okay for a fill-up and if you're not picky about taste or what you put into your body, but next time I think I'll pass and be a little more decisive about my restaurant choices in the area."}
{"text":"Ok if your not picky.   Not the cleanest place. Price ok. Atmosphere is the typical all-u-can eat setting.   Personally, I'd skip this one..."}
{"text":"Nastiest place we ever ate on vacation. Dirty silverware,  got our rolls when we were eating desserts. Ladies bathroom only only soap dispenser worked out of three. Not enough food on line."}
{"text":"THIS RYAN'S HAS CLOSED.  The nearest Ryan's to Champaign-Urbana is now in Effingham.  Definitely not worth a special trip to eat at this sub-par restaurant."}
{"text":"As far as buffets go, this place is fairly decent.    During dinner hours and during Sunday lunch they offer all you can eat Steak.  The steak is pretty tasty in my opinion, but it's nothing to write home about.  The rest of the items are Ok too, the deserts are pretty good.  I'll probably eat there again in the future.    You really shouldn't be expecting anything more from a $10 all you can eat buffet type restaurant."}
{"text":"Ryan's is the kind of place that always has a standard of food that is generally a little above average.  In their averageness, there are times you get amazing hot n tasty food. And there are times when the food has been warmed a little longer in the steam table that it should have been rotated off a while ago.  They serve breakfast on Saturday and Sunday. If you go then, you get the treat of a hot n fresh custom omelette made to order.  The rolls are always good. The service is always attentive.  Today .. the food was on the better than average side. I had a coupon to get an extra $1 off for breakfast that was sent to me in email as I'm part of their club. Generally, if I have a coupon, I'll visit as it helps the overall value. If I don't have one, then it depends on the occasion or how hungry I am.  For Ryan's.. a good visit. Better than most visits. 3 stars."}
{"text":"The pricing of the food is excellent - the building as a whole is filthy - the blinds at the window seating has years of collective dust on them - the health department should shut the place down because of the  bathrooms - it's human to eat and go to the bathroom - the flooring in the dining area rekes of mold. Where is the Standard that was so solid in America!"}
{"text":"The restaraunt doesn't appear to be cleaned often.  Management is rude, and unappreciative of paying guests.  I lodged a concern with Corporate, and was told corporate would get back with me,  but they never did.  There's your sign.  There was no flatware available on the side we sat on, and that was at both self-serve stations the flatware is placed at.  Some food must have sat for hours, as it was luke warm and some of the bread type offerings had become stale.  AVOID, as it is not inexpensive to eat here!"}
{"text":"This is a buffet style restaurant that was absolutely disgusting in ever possible aspect of the place.  The bathrooms were unclean, which was unacceptable for a restaurant, I would have rather used the toilet at a truck stop.  Some of the rolls were acceptable, but others could have been skipped across a pond.  The waiter service was the only redeemable aspect of Ryan's.  However, how about adding some more cleaning people?  The buffet itself was littered with crumbs of food and muck.  The floors here were stickier than a day care center in the ghetto.  Skip this restaurant (or at least at this location) at any cost."}
{"text":"I was disappointed at my recent visit to Ryan's.  I used to love coming here during my U of I days, but it has been some time since I ate here and things have gone downhill.  First, the buffet seems so much smaller than it used to be, with less choices than before.  The food was meh, just stuff to fill my hungry stomach.   As for the atmosphere, it looks like they haven't improved the interior since I was there last.  The tables and chairs are old, and the rugs and walls seem worn.  The only positive was a nice waitress that kept are drinks full and cooed over how cute my son is...an extra star just for that."}
{"text":"If you have a hang over and need foood. Breakfast is goood and cheap, $5.99. You can stuff yourself and go back to bed."}
{"text":"The food at this Ryan's is actually pretty decent, but the overall experience is severely marred by a total lack of cleanliness in the dining and serving areas. The dessert bar was particularly revolting during our visit--mostly as a result of their failure to enforce the rule against unattended children at the buffet.  On the positive side, they offer a military discount. And the lady who refilled our tea was very nice. But our family will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Me and my husband went there for lunch yesterday.  We both got a piece of chicken.  Luckily he tore it apart with a fork first.  AS IT WAS RAW, RAW CHICKEN.  We got the waitress and complained she even commented it was RAW.  She took it to the manager, we ended up with a coupon for free meal.  NO one checked the chicken still on the buffet !!!!  I got physically ill just a few hours after leaving restraint !!!!  Vomiting, diarrhea !!!"}
{"text":"The best fried chicken in town, as well as the only place to get greens, black-eyed peas, and many other country dishes. The only thing they don't do well is fried potatoes. I've never been disappointed. I know a lot of people think buffet restaurants are bad in principle, but this one is an exception.  Nice staff, good service and clean dishes all add to the experience. A little pricey, yes, but you will leave satisfied"}
{"text":"Little selection and everything is overcooked and dry"}
{"text":"Unless you want food poisoning, don't eat here. The majority of the patrons are filthy as well."}
{"text":"Food was good and the service wasn't bad either. The only thing I have to complain about is the floor was dirty and they weren't quick to clean the tables after someone left."}
{"text":"The dirtiest kitchen I have ever seen!  I will never eat here!! The carpet is dirty and things are just run down,  I walked in and walked right back out,"}
{"text":"I go to Ryan's because I like green olives on my salad and they have them on the salad bar---for real!  I do feel that the buffet is over-priced, BUT:  they have excellent servers for a buffet restaurant.  The get tipped very well from me and I try to mention to the manager on duty that I got GREAT SERVICE AGAIN!  I hope they all make lots of money...because they earn it."}
{"text":"Year 2 Update Review Boy what was I thinking. Once again I failed to read my own review. I recently had a BOGO coupon from a coupon booklet purchased for fundraising and after a long day of yard work decided to come here for a quick dinner. Ugh, the food I believe is even worse. The steak which I use to like has even more tenderizer. Due to the tenderizer, the beef cooks very dark and it is very hard to tell how well done your steak is when the cook holds it up and ask is this okay. My first piece was flame grilled on the outside and a dark purple color. Very chewy and not soft at all, caked in salt. Everything was so salty. The place continues to be very dirty and tables remain unclean. Many of the other buffet items sat empty with no one to fill. The dessert area was \"deserted\". There was no more cookies left and various areas were just simply empty while the staff stood in the back chatting and preparing for tomorrows items. This really is the last straw and I have made a mental note, ever again will I come here just like Hometown Buffet down the street.  Health code rating: D. Tables are unclean. Clean silverwear from the washer has particles stuck on. Plates have deep cuts in them from people trying to cut through the steak. Ugh. http://champaign.il.gegov.com/champaign/estab.cfm?facilityID=969"}
{"text":"We love to eat at Ryans. While the furniture and carpet is outdated the restaurant is clean. The steaks are good and cooked correctly. The salad bar has improved greatly this year. I loved the promotions they have such as Thursday night Family night. The new deserts such as lava cake and bread pudding are delicious and a great improvement. We also enjoy the new mini skillet selections, everyone we have tried is wonderful. Keep up the improvements you are moving in the right direction."}
