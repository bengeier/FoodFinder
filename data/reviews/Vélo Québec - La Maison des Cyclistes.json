{"text":"Really nice place to relax next to la fontina park  Has decent coffee and pastries  Also have a selection of sandwiches , salads and beverages  So you many options to choose from"}

{"text":"My bicycle-crazy friend insisted that we all go here on our visit to Montreal. It's a great little coffee shop (and a bike shop, too-- that's pretty cool!). The vibe reminds me a bit of Maglianero in Burlington, VT. I eschewed a drink in favor of some wonderful chocolate cake thing that was filled with a chocolatey, gooey substance in the middle and it was DELICIOUS. My friends got coffees and beers, though, be warned-- if you get a beer you have to order a non-alcohol item with it. I guess they don't want this place turning into a bar, and I can understand that.  Super location-- it's across from the park, and just down the road from Resto La Banquise, where you can find some of the best poutine in the city."}
{"text":"Oh, YES. DO go here. Definitely. Situated on the corner right across from Parc Lafontaine, this is a gem of a high end café with a super casual interior. I was seriously pleased with my Americano and remember commenting to my partner after the first sip about how it was possibly the best coffee I'd gotten in the city so far.  There's nothing pretentious or hipster about this place, despite the fact that it's some fair trade and some organic and all those good, healthy things we've grown to love and ask for. It's a friendly spot, and if I recall, they give out free bike maps of the city. Their foods and treats are impeccable as well. Picnic in the park or pull up your wheels and sit inside. You don't need a slick cycle suit to enter, either - rickety flower basket cyclist types like me are welcome, too! Oh, almost forgot: there's a little boutique inside as well! I'll see what compels me to drop some of my hard-earned cash next time I'm in."}
{"text":"Really nice place and helpful folks for bicycle info.  Good little cafe and bike shop.  Got nice Quebec Velo jersey."}
{"text":"C'est un endroit spécialisé qui répond à une demande bien précise. Pour tous ces amoureux du vélo c'est un endroit parfait. L'atmosphère est décontractée et on ne mets pas vraiment de pression. Un endroit convenable pour y écrire ou y lire.   Du côté thé et café on est dans le générique et l'insipide. Un bon endroit si vous avez besoin de conseils vélo ou si vous habitez devant."}
{"text":"Coffee and bikes. Together. Forever. As they should be.  It's a cute location, and although the seating isn't so plentiful, the drinks are tasty and the baked goods even tastier. The times I've been there, there's been a lot of foot traffic from people going in and out of a back room. Hostel? Something sketchier? Anyway, I'm very appreciative of the lovely location, the plentiful bike parking, and the lattes. It's right at the intersection of Rachel and de Brebeuf, both cycle-friendly streets, and across from the bike entry to Lafontaine. A perfect spot, a great cuppa, and then back on my two-wheeled steed I go."}
