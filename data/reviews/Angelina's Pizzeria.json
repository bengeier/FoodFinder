{"text":"I finally found a pizza that ill never get tired of... and the philly was the best in town"}
{"text":"Terrible. I was quoted 15 minutes for a delivery of three easy hot sandwiches and calamari. 1 hour later we were still waiting and had to call to see where our order was, they didn't even have our name down for the order and had to find it by address. The lady which was the same lady who had taken my order suddenly changed and said typical delivery times are 45-60 minutes.....had that been told to me I would've drove the 10 minutes there and back myself. Not to mention she had a snotty attitude, But an hour and a half later everything shows up luke warm and soggy. I'm assuming they forgot about it....bottom line Do not go there they don't deserve to be called a business. Good waste of 40$"}
{"text":"Service for us was pretty good. He got the chef salad with ranch and a small pepperoni pizza. I got a greek salad with ceasar dressing.  They were good and large size. His comment about the pizza was \"that he would rather get one at papa murphy's\". I tried a piece and I agree.   Not sure but the crust didn't look or taste like fresh made. My sister has a store in Idaho (White Horses) and she sells pizza. Frozen dough. This was like that one.  Had no idea the dressings were fresh made didn't notice.   Will we go back? Probably not."}
{"text":"Just passing through town, loved the colorful atmosphere and the great service."}
{"text":"We have loved delivery from Angelina's for a while but tonight we had a terrible experience. We ordered a specialty pizza and there was almost no meat on it. When we called to let them know, they were rude and stubborn. The girl on the phone offered us a credit on our next order so my husband said he wanted to order another pizza now. She didn't understand that this was the same as offering us a new pizza with actual meat on it and refused to place the order. My husband was upset enough about it to bring it back to them and they still refused to acknowledge that there was a lack of ground beef on the cheeseburger pizza. We are saddened to say that we won't be ordering from Angelina's again after this. It's a shame because we have had great service and quality food up until now."}
{"text":"We decided to give another try from two months ago. The pizza was good, sauce and cheese on all pieces this time, the wings actually had sauce on them this time, but they still forgot the 2 liter of soda that came with the special. Always something wrong if not all wrong. We will not give another chance. 3 strikes, sorry, you are OUT!"}
{"text":"After an appointment, I was hungry and saw this place.  I thought I would give it a try.  The decor was nice and dining room clean.  I took advantage of the lunch special and ordered the 1 topping personal pizza and soda for $5.99.  The pizza took a while but it is because they make it fresh.  It was delicious!  Crust was crunchy on the outside, chewy on the inside.  Cheese and mushrooms were fresh.  I would definitely come back to try more items.  The only minuses would be that the waitress never checked back in on me.  I wanted a refill on my soda.  There were two other tables and she checked on them, but not me for some reason.  And when I first walked in, there was an employee smoking by the door."}
{"text":"So I ordered from here once and it sucked. I called and the lady said if I could be on hold and I said ok. 10 mins went by so I hung up and called back and she asks me to hold again. I said hell no I was on hold with you guys the past 10 mins. She was being a super bitch when she reluctantly started letting me order and after not a good bye see you soon. She hung up. Definitely a people person lol."}
{"text":"Great food but the staff are pretty rude  I order here all the time and Server Alicia had misheard the order I wanted delivered to me and when I called back to her let her know it was wrong she went back and fourth with me that she put it in right, but I order the same thing everyday I eat here 3 to 4 times a week and I don't think customer service should be about you going back and fourth with a customer about a mistake that can easily be fixed. The manager was very helpful even though the frustration of waiting a extra 30 to 45 mins to get the right order, she did replace it but then they gave me 2 chicken philly sandwiches with no fries. I'm Unhappy with my order because I wanted extra time to get no fries with both of my orders when I spent over $30 after tipping twice Today with the ordering has been very frustrating, and Alicia should learn not to go back and fourth with a customer just simply apologize and take it up with a manager."}
{"text":"Don't order from here! I ordered a pizza and well done wings and they gave me chicken fingers. Not to mention I ordered a 2 liter of sierra mist and when I got it I looked at the expiration date and it expired the day before. Also I ordered the nacho cheese philly cheesesteak and they never gave me any nacho cheese. I will not be coming back here."}
{"text":"Very good place to eat at 1 or 3 am when everything else is closed for delivery. The wings are ok but everything else on the menu especially the fried Calamari very good."}
{"text":"I would give the meal no stars if I could. 2 Gyros and Calamari $30.00!!! We even picked it up. Calamari was spongy and gross, fries were pure salt and soggy, tzatziki on Gyros was the only decent thing. The Gyros themselves were made with low quality meat which was barely put on there anyway. I tried to be open minded and give this place a chance because it is so close to my home. However, now I know why it has received so many poor reviews. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE THE FOOD IS TERRIBLE!!!"}
{"text":"I've ordered 4 times. The first order never showed up. I got my refund, no worries. The next to orders were the same pizza, but looked completely different when they arrived. Same pizza 100% different look. I wasn't to phased by this. They were inconsistent yea, but I had only ordered twice. Just got my 3rd/4rth order tonight. This time the pizza was covered completely in lettuce and mayo.. I always order a cheeseburger pizza. But it has never been this absurd. Don't get me wrong, after i peeled off all of the crazy amounts of lettuce covered with mayo it was a delicious pizza. But still very inconsistent. This pizza was LOADED with limp brown lettuce and mayo. I used to work at papa johns and one thing my location prided itself on was a consistent pizza. Even when I quit that job I only bought from that location. Maybe I'm spoiled with consistent pizzas. But for such a good tasting item, you'd think the restaurant would want to keep the customer coming back. I will most likely order one more time from this place. If the pizza isn't what I got the first time i ordered it.. I'll just find a new pizza joint. Great tasting pizza, when you get what you ordered. Other than that I've demoted the restaurant down to mediocre at best. Hope they get there \"stuff\" together for my 4th/5th order. I will order again, but I will not specify my order. I will ask for  the same order I've asked for in hopes of receiving the first pizza I got. If I don't get it, no more pizza from here. It's not too much to ask for a decent pizza."}
{"text":"I called to place an order for delivery and asked if they had any pizza specials.Well I think that was the start to a poor experience at Angelinas.She said they had over 36 specials and wanted me to go to their website to check it out. The 4 of us just wanted some pizza delivered so we could eat while watching some football.I then asked the girl what size would feed 4 people and that was problem #2.She proceeded to tell me the size and slices in the different pizzas.I asked if the 24 inch pizza would feed 4 and she couldn't give me a straight answer.I took it upon myself and ordered it with everything  on it.I was told it would be 45 mins.to an hour to be delivered and a $5 delivery fee would be added in.So I said ok and she told me it would be $36 and change.You would think it would be REALLY good and feed 4 people...right? Wrong...it was terrible tasting and easily fed 6 people to boot.I will never eat there again!"}
{"text":"Like this place really good wings and good take out pizza deals, friendly staff. Good deals"}
{"text":"I have had a lot of pizza my life and this has got to be the top two worst pizzas outside of an AMPM. The customer service is great I came in right before closing time, actually one minute before closing and the host was very good at her job.  I got home and the pizza dough was soggy the pizza fell apart. Also the  person that made the pizza didn't cut the pizza very well at all and just tore apart . The cheese is cheap , definitely not high quality hence the reason large was $10. The topping which was sausage is good . I ate 3 pieces of the pizza and that was the end of it as you can see the picture. You get better quality at Little Caesars  I usually just eat the pizza because usually the pizza is good if it's falling apart but it was horrendous and I'm not sure if the dough sat out all day that was used or whatever causes it to be soggy , or if the person making the pizza was just lazy. If the dough was sitting out all day I would rather have just not have the order placed.  Definitely the cheese is crap and they need to upgrade the cheese that they use, but the toppings are fine.   I'm not here trying to get a refund because I didn't call the next day cuz it's useless and if they want to give me a new pizza I had to be careful because the cook knows you're pissed off and will do something to the dough or something within the pizza and I'll get sick"}
{"text":"Great service!! Very friendly girls up front, they always give us service with a smile! We have a big family and lots of kids so when we need somewhere to hold a party or event we ALWAYS choose Angelinas!! They are so helpful and everything we need is available to us. The food is great, they have tons of deals and combination specials to save us some cash!! We usually go with the GIGANTIC 24inch pizza! I would for sure recommend Angelinas!!"}
{"text":"This place is located inside my favorite bar in the south and has very big menu and great pizza the best part is the crust it's really stands out. Highly recommended if your are in the area"}
{"text":"The pizza is soggy. I picked it up and there was just a nasty pool of grease. I only got deliver but the quality of the food is low. I would much rather eat at dominos"}
{"text":"Pizza was OK but the tirimisu taste like maple syrup which isn't even an ingredient in tirimisu"}
{"text":"They have poor customer service! We orders $60 worth of food it came all messed up.  I even called and let them know and have a print out of my delivery. ( they were more concerned about the way I received my print out...???? Email confirmation and refused to refund me,  only store credit.  They wanted food back.  They didn't even want to redeliver!!"}
{"text":"From LA, Ca. I was in Vegas for a day of moving furniture. Being new to the area I searched on Yelp for pizza. Found Angelina's and ordered a pepperoni pizza,  20 mild hot wing, 8 teriyaki chicken strips aka chicken fingers + a 2 liter soda for less than $forty! The mild wings were my favorite. The fingers, were ok. The pizza was really good, especially with the mild sauce on the side!  Call them, if you like quick delivery and good fast food. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"If you don't sell pizza by the slice, you might as well be Domino's. Average at best."}
{"text":"Orders the fingers, 8\" cheese pizza, garlic balls.  Yuk, the fingers are pre frozen, pre packaged with some kind of corn mill mush coating and very, very greasy.. The pizza was fro a 5 year old who loves pizza, he eat one peace  and would not eat anymore. They say the fingers are large, nope, they are just as big as any other place has them . Never will we ever eat at this place again.. Five thumbs down..."}
{"text":"2 hours for delivery! On top of that, when it finally arrived it was not worth it at all. Won't be ordering again."}
{"text":"first time here cause people told they have good pizza. gave it a shot.they don't have good pizza. THEY HAVE GREAT PIZZA. this is east coast jersey new York boardwalk style  thin crust fold it in half and use your hands pizza.if you want to use a knife and fork to eat your pizza go back to chitown where you came from. I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time with this place. There's far better pizza places here in Vegas. We came across this place as we were in the mood for pizza. The interior is nice and everything but that's the only good thing about it. The waitress (smelt like smoke big time) brought us menus after we had been sitting for about 5 minutes already.  After we ordered our drinks  it took about another 10 minutes to get them. The soda was TERRIBLE. They must not have cleaned their machine or cups because it tasted like dirty sink water mixed with soda. After ordering new drinks and finishing them, not once did one of the waitresses fill up our cup or ask us if we needed a refill after our cups were sitting empty when we were supposed to get free refills. Pizza was alright, had better.  We also ordered garlic bread for an appetizer and we only got it because one of us went up to the counter and had to ask for it, and the lady at the counter said she'll go check on it (they forgot about it). Not only did we get the garlic bread after our pizza but it was burnt to a crisp and they still brought it out to us!  Also, another couple came in while we were eating and sat at a table close to us. None of the workers greeted them nor brought them menus. After about 10-15 minutes of waiting for service that couple just left.  20 minutes after eating and on our way home, all of our stomachs turned and headed south. Something wasn't good in the food we ate.  Long story short. Over priced. Terrible service. Eh food. Unsanitary."}
{"text":"I brought in my son & husband after always being pretty curious about this place just down the street from my residence and I'm glad I did. I was so amazed at how more than reasonable the prices are to the large portions! My husband and son both enjoyed their bacon cheeseburgers and they had a very tasty chips and fish with tarter sauce for me. I didn't catch my waitress' name, but she was pleasant and friendly as opposed to the negative reviews here. I really appreciated her service and the enjoyable sit down meal we had. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Ordered pizza after a late night on the strip. Ingredients were good and seemed to be good quality. Pizza was hot when it was delivered and the driver was nice. It was a little pricier than I expected but not crazy."}
{"text":"I love this place! They have the best blue cheese in town!!! The staff is awesome and wouldn't think about going anywhere else."}
{"text":"This is is horrible! I called in an order and the lady on the phone was rude! It was like an inconvenience for me to call and place and order to go! Not to mention, the food was not good! I've tired this place before and it was bad and the people were rude but I thought I would give it another shot! I do not recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Have ordered delivery there numerous times and they always mess something up these people need to learn how to read orders how you get a calzone confused with a pizza like come now"}
{"text":"I would really like to give them Five Stars, but I can't.  My wife and I love the pizza, the price is right, the restaurant is nice and most of the employees are friendly but the services is so hit and miss.  I definitely recommend picking up if you have the option.  They are usually very busy and delivery consistantly takes a long time.  When picking up I need to let you know they are always going to tell you 20 minutes.  Sometimes it's 20 minutes and sometimes it's 60+ minutes.  You also need to remind them that you are waiting for your pizza after you've paid because they will let you sit in the restaurant until you say something or they realize that you've been there for a long time.  I will gladly come back and change my rating to Five Stars if they correct these few things."}
{"text":"I order from here at least once a week for lunch. I have to start off by saying they have awesome lunch specials. For under $10 you get great quality lunch combos that include fries and drink. The pizza is not the best but I've noticed that the larger the pie you order the less doughy it is and better it taste. I recommend ordering the pizza \"well done\". That sandwiches are very good. Always ask for a side of ranch, they make their own ranch and it's awesome. That evening shift can sometimes have bad service if you dine-in."}
{"text":"Have tried ordering twice..Delivery takes at least 90 minutes from order at lunch and dinner took 2 hours and 15 minutes.  Fries get were soggy. Won't give it a third try not worth the hassle."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!  wow nothing good to say at all about this dump. Ordered a dinner dish. A ceaser salad and spaghetti. They gave me iceberg lettuce (crap) with a side of ceaser dressing. About 30 minutes later my meal comes out.  Sauce was cold.. Ten min later they finally bring it back...ABSOLUTE garbage for being in seven hiLLS. OH and you get to see the employees smoke cigs outside while your eating right in front of them. Its all can good food..i'd rather eat at pizza hut or cicis"}
{"text":"Pizza is 3 stars.  Price is 5 stars as they have a pick-up special that runs indefinitely.  Service is 5 stars.  The girls up front are always friendly and the pizza is always ready at the time quoted.    I go here because of the service, convenience and price."}
{"text":"WARNING! Very unsanitary establishment. I dined in once and the fries were stale tasting but didn't think much about it until I ordered a home delivery. The bread was old and teh fries were stale AGAIN!!. Im getting sick just thinking about it. Stay very far away from this place YUCK!  I called them to complain and they offered me a coupon LOL! No thanks. I wont be back"}
{"text":"AVOID this place. Ordered a calzone and after biting into it a couple of times it felt like chewing gum. I broke into it and found large clumps of dough - called the place and they said theyd refund me for the raw dough calzone LIAR!!!! Its a good thing a was smart enough to take a video of the raw dough calzone before throwing it away. Had super stomach problems from it. I reported this to the Southern Nevada Heath District and will be forwarding them my video. The worst part (besides the cramps) was they never apologized and they straight out LIED about the refund-Charged the total to my CC. This is the Las Vegas angelinas. Despicable!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery twice.  First time was about 15 minutes late, but we are rather far from their location, and it was a Friday night in Vegas.  Second delivery was in the alotted time, but food was a little cold.  Pizza and Calzone: crust is fantastic, so is the sauce.  Cheese is excellent quality and a generous amount.  The one thing that kept me from giving it a 5th star was the meat toppings.  Pepperoni was OK, but the sausage nuggets and meatball were little to be desired.  It is a shame because the cheese pizza alone was excellent, especially for the price.  It deserves real sausage and fresh meatballs, not frozen.  Meatball sub:  Bread, OK.  Sauce and Cheese excellent.  Meatballs were spongy and tasteless.  Almost 100% sure they are frozen prefab meatballs.  They really should make their own.  If they do make them, they need a new recipe.  Again, that's what we ordered.  Pizza is still pretty damn good, even with the cheap meatball and sausage topping.  Good enough for 4 stars for the pizza alone.  Straight Pepperoni would be the best bet.  If the owners are reading this, your pizza deserves better quality meats!  That's all I recommend.  I'm sure I will eat from there again."}
{"text":"I've had Angelina's before, delivery has always been a little slow.  BUT, this time, I was at a friends house, and he wanted to give it a try.  He asked me what I thought.  I said it was pretty good.  I like the pizza.  He called in an order.  Pizza and an order of Calamari, with marinara on the side.    1 hour and 4 minutes later, during midweek, ordered at 9pm.  Nothing going on in town or TV, that should hold it up this long.  OK, slow delivery is no big deal.  My friend kinda gave the driver a bit of a hard time, but he did say he didn't blame him for the hold up.  Driver left.  Pizza was cold, not luke warm, COLD.  Calamari?  Way over done, was chocolate brown, not golden.  Cold, and tough as chewing rubber bands.  They were the frozen, pre-made kind.  No big deal.  Just drop in the fryer. How hard can that be?  WAY OVER DONE!  On top of it all, NO MARINARA to dip them in.  So we're both eating a slice, because we're starving at this point.  My friend gets on the phone to figure out what could be done for us.  After saying the pizza was cold and there was no marinara, he was put on hold, then disconnected.  CALLED BACK. She got on..... said what was wrong, plus added the calamari was rock hard.  After chastising him for eating some of the pizza, she offered a discount on the next purchase.  Didn't talk amounts.  My friend said that wouldn't do.  He wanted it re done, or a refund.  She said the manager would be back a 11pm and to call then.  She didn't want to deal with it.    With a bottle of Pepsi, it came to $30.  What a waste of money, for product that would have cost them less that $5 to replace, that would have kept a customer and gained a new one.  Not only was this his first and last time ordering from there, but I recommended Angelina's to him.  So guess what? THEY LOST ME AS A CUSTOMER TOO.  They need to train their employees to have better manners, and some customer service skills.  Their current rating reflects how the place is being run.  The owners should be embarrassed and disappointed.  Good luck staying in business when there is a pizza joint in every strip mall."}
{"text":"I've ordered from this place numerous times being that it is close to my job. I'm a bag of lazy bones when it comes to bringing lunch to work so I tend to order out A LOT. I would have to say that Angelina's is the top place that I order from.  I've gotten a bunch of different items from their menu and I have never been disappointed. So, let's go down the list from some of my favorite items:  1. The Chicken Ranch Wrap - by far, my favorite item from their menu. The wrap is chockful of great flavors. The chicken is slightly crispy, the lettuce is fresh and the red onion gives it a nice kick. The ranch sauce they mix in is wonderful - not too much, not too little. It's $8.95 for the wrap and you get your share of greasy french fry carbs. You can't beat it! I'm definitely stuffed after I eat it.  2. Ricky Bobby Cheesesteak - I'm not a huge fan of BBQ sauce so I prefer it without, but other than that, this cheesesteak is delectable! American cheese, delicious steak, sauteed mushrooms and a mix of onion rings makes this dish one of my top favorites. The best part is the onion rings. When I bite into the cheesesteak, I can a taste of all the different flavors and a slight crisp from the deep fried onion ring batter. Mmm mmm good!  3. 8 Wings with Fries - They have a ton of sauces to choose from. My favorites, hands down, were the garlic parm and the sweet chili. The sweet chili has a little bit of spice but enough of the sweet flavor to keep me grabbing for more wings. The garlic parm ones were nicely doused in a sea parm and every bite is full of garlicky goodness.  I've never eaten at the actual establishment, but I'm quite content with ordering delivery or take out. The woman I speak with every time is pleasant and they conveniently have my work's address saved into their system for every time I order. Delivery time averages about 45 minutes around dinner time and I haven't had a problem with cold food from there. I absolutely love this pizzeria - one of my favorite places to order from definitely compared to the tons of pizza joints in Vegas. Thanks Angelinas!"}
{"text":"We ordered our food through eat24 for pickup. Once we arrived we were told that eat24 messed up the transmission of the order and it would be an additional 15 minutes. 25-30 minutes later our pizza was brought out to us with the WRONG TOPPINGS! We left empty handed after wasting all that time. It's a shame since their pizza is decent, but we've had too many ordering issues"}
{"text":"I love the food here but lately customer service is a concept that eludes them. The last few times we have ordered they have gotten our order wrong requiring us to go back to get it fixed. I used to be able to call my order in when leaving work and it was ready when I arrived to pick it up. But now it takes over and hour to get a simple cheese pizza. I will never come back to this place, I would rather eat horrible food but get treated like they appreciate my business."}
{"text":"I know its a pizza place, but why not have delicious  burgers as well!! Picked it up, bun was sssoo stale it fell apart!! So much salt, could  barely eat it!! Note  to cook, lightly salt, not xxxx salt!!! Owners should sell, other bad reviews also!!"}
{"text":"Had a little trouble with the online ordering and it never went through and had to call but this place is amazing. We've tried other places since we've moved here and nothing compares. This is the spot to order from! The same woman I see everytime I pick up my order and she's always polite and acts chipper. That's the customer service that is comforting and makes you excited to be there. Always picking this place"}
{"text":"I must admit I was concerned after reading the reviews, but we decided to take a chance, sure glad we did. We ordered pizza, wings, & lasagna. Pizza was NY style, wait was short & pizza was very good, wings were like my lady SPICY & HOT (LOL), the way I like em, lasagna according to my son was excellent. Food went down good with my beer while listening to 70's rock! What more can you ask for? I'm glad we didn't fiind the competition this place is a must! I guess the adage \"don't believe everything you read\" until you try it applies. Definitely will be coming back to Decatur & Russell!!!"}
{"text":"Saturday in 7 Hills, 6:30pm, 1st time customer to Angelina's (also will be the last time), phone order for pick-up, \"Vegas meats\" pizza.  Pick-up 7pm, should have known something was wrong, only three customers in the place.  Got the pizza home, no balance to the placements of small cut-up pieces of meats and or silvers of shredded crap cheese, piles of stuck together meats, pepperoni, salami, small sasages pieces, sloppy bunched up placement, a pile here, a pile there, sliced meats all stuck together. One side of the pizza is burnt, cheese is lacking all over.  First bite pure salt flavor,  looked down at the plate, its an orange oil slick, deep horizion like flow of nasty orange oil, more oil is dripping down my arm...  Completely  Nasty!  Smiths house brand frozen pizza is better then this place.  $22.00 Completely wasted!  First bite - last bite!"}
{"text":"We have ordered here a few times. Mostly togo, haven't done delivery yet but by the reviews I guess thats not a good idea.  Tonight we dined in, we were greeted immediately & told to sit anywhere we would like.   Our server was very friendly and very patient with us.   Food was prompt. Wasn't too long of a wait at all. I order the shrimp scampi and asked for light butter, I feel like there was still quite a bit of butter but thats ok. I ate all the shrimp, it was pretty tasty. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their meal. Garlic parm wings weren't bad either.    I wouldn't say the food is out of this world but it isn't awful.   Dessert was yummy. Tiramisu :)"}
{"text":"How do u come all the way to my place and forget the main food I ordered PIZZA, and then u had the nerve to want a tip...here's a tip don't forget the order and dress appropriately not in no dirty sweats and a gun club shirt...and Ofcourse the pizza was cold..."}
{"text":"We had lunch delivered to our place of business today, over an hour wait, food was cold, 2 of the 4 that had lunch were vomiting within half an hour, I'm not sure what happened, the delivery guy was rude to our receptionist, never again. This was the absolute worst experience thus far in what is available in the area. Beware."}
{"text":"I ordered a Stromboli. I don't really like the red pizza sauce so I wanted to sub for the white sauce. I wish they would of put it inside with the rest of the toppings instead of on the side. It would of made all the difference. Besides that, it was delicious and huge.  The wings I ordered were SO good. Some of the best I've had in a while."}
{"text":"We were looking for anew plavce to enjoy  We ordered chicken finger horrible DRY Stromboli sandwich was ok Big mistake don't waste your time  can't even rate that BAD"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. Food late,took over an hour  and cold. All toppings for pizza slid off the pizza into the box. Hoagie said it wabs to have American cheese mushrooms and onions and had none of the above. We did try to fix the hoagie but it was inedible.  When we called about it they were rude. Waste of 50.00...but guaranteed they will never get another penny from me."}
{"text":"Just ordered tonight, and oh my god was I disappointed. From the long wait, to the unedible food.  My boyfriend ordered a chicken gyro and I ordered fingers and fries with a drink and dessert. Our total comes up to $35. About the price I'd normally pay at a sit down restaurant, but fine. Delivery time of 70-90 minutes. That's a little excessive don't you think? Ok, whatever. Food finally arrives, my boyfriend is waiting downstairs outside.. See's the driver get out and proceed to his trunk where he pulled our food out of (What in the world?)   Fast forward to eating... Not only do we both have cold, soggy fries, the fingers are soggy as well!! Mushy texture, very unpleasant. Boyfriend said he didn't even think it was chicken in his gyro. Couldn't even eat 2/3 of our food. Went to dessert which was the only somewhat, appetizing carrot cake and chocolate later cake. Carrot care was really chewy, not cake like at all. Chocolate cake had a weird after taste.  All in all.  Not worth the money or wait. Left with an empty stomach, unsatisfited appetite, and full of regret. 1 star is being generous."}
{"text":"- Ordered pizza at 7:15pm for delivery - Called at 8:15pm asking where our pizza was  - Was told it was around the corner  - Manager called us 45mins later asking for our address - Pizza finally showed up at 9:15pm - Wrong pizza was delivered  - Called manager who told us to send the pizza back and they'ed send the correct pizza back for a 20% discount - The pizza showed up looking like the driver took corners going 90mph"}
{"text":"We have been looking for good pizza out here for years and haven't found anything, until we tried Angelinas when they opened in Seven Hills. We had been looking for something similar to what we used to get back in CA and finally found it!   Angelinas has the perfect amount of sauce, cheese and the right size of crust...not too thick, not too thin, right in-between. The flavors are fresh and we now add several toppings and get creative. The Stromboli and chicken wings are really good too.  The service is great. Everyone is friendly and we usually have our order delivered, which never takes as long as they quote. All I can say is that I am glad that theirs is one flyer on my door that I didn't throw away!"}
{"text":"They always mess up my delivery order. Then they are reluctant to fix it, and have never offered any type of compensation. They act like they're doing me a favor by completing our original agreement for which I've already paid.    Sorry but I expect competent service when I pay ridiculous prices.  Where will I ever find another pizza, sub or wing shop that delivers in Pittsburgh?"}
{"text":"Love this place! I eat lunch here frequently and the service is great! The prices are reasonable for the amount of food you get. The portions tend to be large.  The time it takes for food to be brought out is reasonable and I am always able to get back to work down the street in time. I have a one hour lunch so this is a perfect place to eat lunch if you are nearby. They have lunch specials that comes with drinks too!  The pizzas are amazing especially their buffalo one with ranch on top. Their garlic knots and breadsticks are fantastic! They are definitely a must try! The garlic knots tend to be really smothered with garlic (oil? Maybe butter) so if you don't like that then I suggest the breadsticks. One order of garlic knots can probably be enough for two to three people! The breadsticks are smaller but still more than one person to eat alone especially if you also order any entrees."}
{"text":"Made a mistake imaging my order onlinethat. Accidentally sent it to the east Charleston location, not realizing till I arrived to pick it up. The staff was really accommodating and transferred my order, putting it on rush so I could get back to work. Dumb, embarrassing mistake fixed by a great staff. Thank you!  Plus, the veggie pizza is ahmazing :-)"}
{"text":"Ever since they changed servers the service here has been awesome. I come here for lunch and we're always in and out. The food has also improved. One happy customer."}
{"text":"Food poisoning.  I've had it before and I know what it is.  I purchased a single slice of pepperoni, sausage, and ham pizza on the afternoon of 4/11/15, shortly before hopping on a bus out of town.  About seven hours later my body began rejecting ALL contents of my upper and lower intestines in the most horrific and prolonged way imaginable.  It is now four days later and I still have not fully recovered.  It was some of the worst agony I have experienced.  Just a warning for those with the foresight to check the reviews before deciding.  How I wish I had chosen ANY of the other restaurants at the Riviera food court.  How did the pizza taste?  My recollection is that it tasted a little... \"off\".  But certainly not in a way that would send up a red flag.  Zero stars."}
{"text":"Way better than dominos or Pizza Hut! Giant pizzas. Delivery takes longer then most places but I won't drop it a star because the pizza is great pizza.  Nice little neighbor hood place to sit down to dine in."}
{"text":"Worst service possible!!! Lady seemed like I was inconveniencing her when I called to place my order, when I told her it was for delivery she quoted it would be an hour and a half so I opted for pick up. She told me it would be 15-20 min but probably more 20 minute range... Still not a problem 22 minutes go by I start the drive ... It takes a couple min to get there so let's say total 25 minutes... Go inside pay and then I get told it'll be another 10 minutes... I doubt they even started the order because It has now been 15 addition minutes and I still have no food .... Way to go never order from this place again. Right after the post I received the order so 40 minutes total for a pick up order! Shame cause it's good food."}
{"text":"Very cheap ingredients terrible wings the sauce was good but the wings were all nasty with broken bones. The pizza cheese was not good sorry but I won't order again:-("}
{"text":"I ordered food for a department of mine here at work and one item was missing, a bacon burger with fries. Once we got the food is when I noticed and called the restaurant location of which was provided on my grubhub app. The lady on the phone was very quick to deny it was her location and said to try another one. I called two other locations and realized it really must be that first one. I called and she was still quick to deny it but finally decided to take 3 seconds and look up my delivery address and she soon realized it was her location. She then blamed the missing item on the grubhub driver saying it was his responsibility to check the items and I informed her it should be both the restaurant to check the order list to prepare and the grubhub person to make sure the right items are being delivered. Long story short she told me to call grubhub and I told her she should have some sense of taking responsibility and want to help me resolve this. She said she would place another order and have it delivered. I then got a call from grubhub saying they credited me the item and nothing was being delivered. The grubhub associate was kind enough to give me a $7 credit to reorder  so I did just that so my associate would be able to have a lunch. Unfortunately there's a minimum order amount and also a $4.99 deliver fee so even after everything I had to pay $15. The lady at the restaurant was so quick to pass blame and not take any responsibility for her mistake and made me go on a wild goose chase just to find the originating restaurant. I work in a high pace customer service environment and just to see the lack of interest in helping us was very disappointing. Also the driver needed some major help figuring out where to bring the food and I was pretty specific on the directions in the app but the driver was at least kind and that's all I could ask for. I didn't even want to reorder from them but I needed to get my employee his lunch so I reluctantly did. Two thumbs down. I give it two stars just because the food actually wasn't bad but the review is based majority on service."}
{"text":"The food really isn't that bad. It's the rude people that work there. Just call and see. The lady I spoke to who I think is from the east coast is just a plain bitch. Nothing else to it. She acts like it's an inconvenience when you call her to place an order. When you go in, they have never said thank you, not even once, they never answer the phone nicely, they are just insincere and rude. It's really just bad customer service that makes this a terrible place. I used to go here quite often but honestly the service just isn't worth the convenient location."}
{"text":"Five stars. I'll say it again. Five stars.   Why? Just look at the number of items offered on the menu. If you're not already ready to order, keep reading.   Hours of operation. You can get some good food almost round the clock.   Taste. The food delivered on taste.  We ordered a cheese pizza, mozzarella sticks, jalapeño poppers, mango habanero wings, cheese cake, a Dr. Pepper, and a bottled water. It was all delivered promptly, piping hot and with all the necessary dips and seasonings. They even gave us cups and straws for our drinks.   The cheese pizza was good, mozzarella sticks were a tad soft but the flavor was there, jalapeño poppers were great and large, husband said the mango habanero wings were on point, and the drinks are hard to jack up so there you have it.  Don't really understand the negative reviews as we didn't experience any poor service, long wait times, or misses on the food.   Will have to order again to get some more items from the menu. Don't make the same mistake we did and just say \"one of each\" when asked what you would like to order :)"}
{"text":"After a bad experience a year ago with ordering from this place through grub hub I figured I would give it another shot since the food wasn't bad, the delivery just took over an hour and a half. This time I ordered through uber eats and I wasn't disappointed with them at all. They were fast, efficient and they handled the problem that the restaurant made with a positive attitude. I ordered the fettuccine alrdedo meal which comes with garlic bread and a salad and I also ordered a slice of chocolate layer cake. Let's be honest I was most excited about the chocolate cake as it was my cheat meal and I never eat sweets! The delivery showed up just 20 minutes after me placing the order. I tipped the driver, went inside and checked my order to see that they had not given me the cake but of course charged my card. On the uber eats app you can send an email right away saying you were missing an item. I also called the store and they let me know they will either send the driver back with another piece (which I would've preferred because I'm a fatty) or refund the cost of the cake to the uber eats account and that the restaurant will call me back to let me know what was going on. The restaurant never called me back or did anything other than let me know that the person packing the order forgot to put the cake in the bag. Uber eats called me just 5 minutes after sending the email and let me know they have refunded me the cost of the cake plus tax and that they were sorry for the mistake on the restaurants behalf. I was very pleased with uber eats for correcting the problem. I shrugged off the cake and ate my salad, which after seeing had brown patches of lettuce I should not have. The pasta was decent but the salad kind of ruined my appetite and almost immediately my stomach started to hurt. I have been awake since 3 am Vegas time in and out of the bathroom with vomiting and diarrhea that I can only blame on Angelina's as it is the only meal other than an apple that morning that I had eaten all day. I will never go back after this experience. Not even for the chocolate cake!"}
{"text":"pizza is great for large carry out $10 wow, and there ranch delish. and the ladys that work the counter, beautiful.."}
{"text":"Not my favorite. I asked for my pizza to be cut in square. They said no problem and of course they didn't. As for the pizza it was just ok. I think the deliver person knew and he sure was in a hurry to leave.   When I called in the person who answered sounded like I was bothering her.   Not the best experience I have had spending $30 for a pizza. Too many other companies that want my business to call these guys back."}
{"text":"they shouldn't get a full star half start at most . I order off of gruphub at 10:30 am said I would get it around 11:20-11:45am. 1pm comes around and I still didn't get my food. Angelina's Pizzeria had it as pick up not delivery. I waited another hour to get my food to find out that it was the food waiting to be picked up, cold fries and chicken . annoyed and upset is what I am. I am never ordering from this place again."}
{"text":"I called in to place an order, the female on the other end of the line asked if I wanted take out or delivery. I asked how much more take out was, she then asked me for my phone number, address, and gate code, which I said I didn't know, then she said that shouldn't be a problem because the drivers know the code. I asked her how long it would be and she said about 30 minutes.   A little over an hour later, I start wondering where my order is, so I call back and talked to a female again, who I think took the original order. She told me that my order had been sitting there for a half hour and that I definitely didn't ask for delivery, but was supposed to pick it up. I asked if they could deliver it now, she flippantly said that it would take another hour or I could come in to pick it up. Not wanting to wait another hour, I went to pick up the food.   I did speak with a manager when I was there and he comped half of the meal, which was a decently nice gesture that seemed to fall a little short. I also saw him chastise the flip employee who spoke with me on the phone. Another employee shared overhearing the female on the phone and felt that the female was rude. It just felt like the one staff member needed to  be whipped into shaped by the Restaurant Impossible guy. I could feel the attitude that she was projecting at her manager and it was awkward and uncomfortable.   The service was terrible. It just seems odd that you would argue with a customer over whether their order was for pick up for delivery, especially if the restaurant doesn't get paid unless I pick up the food or they deliver it.   The food was okay. The pizza was chilly by the time it made its way home. Some of the greens caprese salad looked a little suspect. All in all not the best experience, quite deserving of a 1 star rating.  I did give it two stars because the garlic balls were very good. I may go back for them, but only if the person who took my order doesn't pick up the phone."}
{"text":"Customer service could be MUCH better. Consider other Angelina's locations before this one."}
{"text":"I'm a longtime Patron who lives up the street from this location, but over the years this place has gone to the dogs, even the pizzas is lousy now."}
{"text":"From hero to zero!   I originally had a nice review up here for these guys.  But 2 days after I ordered my first pizza, I ordered a second one.  They said it would be an hour, which was surprising because they are about 2 blocks from me.  My pizza got here 1 hour and 45 minutes later and it was burnt.  I used to make pizzas for a living, and I know a burnt pizza, this thing had been in there at least twice as long as it should have been.    I was able to eat a slice and a half, the rest went into the trash.  They obviously forgot about it, but it only takes about 10 minutes to make a pizza, the least they could have done is remake it.  It was already almost an hour late....  I filled out a contact form on their website, and several days later I saw that that it had been returned, their info address that their website sends to doesn't go anywhere.  This place seems like its a crapshoot, I wont order here again.   A shame....."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a review it would be zero. It took two hours to arrive and when it came they were the wrong pizzas. When we opened the pizza the pizza was almost upside down. When we called to fix this problem they wanted us to still pay full price and not give us a deal. It was cold and flipped upside down. Horrible customer service. Do no recommend"}

Rude staff here! Even the girl with the glasses litterally looks like a pig!"}
{"text":"Have to say this is the best pizzeria in town!! They have delicious pizza and wings...heck, EVERYTHING on their menu is really good. I order pizza and other food from here all the time and its always great!! and super fresh! I asked if they make their sauce from scratch and they sure do! Also they have the BEST ranch in the WORLD!!! They told me its also homemade. And a lot of other things they make are made in house. This place is great if your gonna have a big party or get together, They do large order deliveries for party's and events! My friend ordered from here once for his birthday party and got their biggest pizza which is their 24\" its HUGE!! and oh boy was it yummy!!! It was their Angelina's Special, and he got bacon on it!!! Yum!!!!! This place is also awesome to dine in or take out. The staff is extremely friendly and very helpful and courteous. I love Angelina's!!! The BEST DAMN PIZZERIA IN VEGAS!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have loved ordering from Angelina's since their original location in Dormont. And when they moved to their new location I was still a loyal customer. I love their spinach and feta pizza! Best pie in the burgh. But I will never be ordering from here again. Here's why... It was a weekday night but it was a pens hockey night so the kitchen was understandably busy. I was told I would have a wait of 45 minutes to an hour. I live in an apartment building so when the driver arrives they usually call when they're outside and I come to the door to meet them. Not this time. The driver was obnoxiously hooking his horn out front. At the time I had no idea this was the driver, as he had no sign on his car. So I ignored it. Few minutes later my phone rings. The conversation... Me: hello  Pizza guy: uh yeah this Angelina's I'm outside with your pizza Me: I'll be right out I went to the door grab my pizza from the driver that looked completely doped out. My bill was $20.02 I had accidentally given him $21(4 $5s and $1) when I meant to give him $26 so he would have a whole $5 tip. I would have never realized this but as he left he screamed \"yeah thanks for the .98 tip\" I'm server so I always always leave 20%. It was a total mistake on my part. But I'm glad I left him less than a dollar because that was so unprofessional and so trashy. Plus the pizza was cold. Called the manager immediately after this happened and explained this to him, he seemed concerned, told me he'd call back but never did. I probably ordered pizza from here 2-3 a month and would highly recommend it to people. Never again. I'm in the service industry and I would never treat a guest the way these employees have treated me. Totally. Unprofessional. And. Careless."}
{"text":"The BEST PIZZA in Vegas! Hands down. Love the authenticity and it's right down the street. I love it. Owners are awesome as well. #5Stars"}
{"text":"I'm not one to review, but I put a order in at 8:32pm and it's now 10:13pm and no show. Called and they said they had trouble with their fax machine. Cmon people get with the program. No discount or anything and they said it was gonna take another 45min-1hr. For my food, smh."}
{"text":"We get a lot of mailers from this place and all of them brag about being voted number 1 Pizza place??? It is furthest from the truth. We moved here from Chicago about 9 months ago and have not found anything better than, what I would qualify as frozen pizza. This pizza we got tonight was the worst. Other than only taken 20 min to get from order to out the door with it, the waiting at the bar was the best part of the experience. The pizza was made from old ingredients, the cheese was bitter and greasy. The amount of toppings was nothing like the picture in the flyers they send to the house (that probably was a good thing). I still have faith that I will find a good pizza here in Vegas but run from Angelina's because it's the worst Not best!!!. Just go to Putters and have a . That's your best bet."}
{"text":"Nothing much stood out with this place.  They deliver, food is decent, and so is the price.  Took an early lunch, and didn't have the motivation to get out of the office.  Got the meatball sub lunch special, fries were a little bit soggy, but they weren't horrible.  Perfect for that lazy lunch day."}
{"text":"Pitiful.    The restaurant was empty so I figured I would get some attention.  Wrong.  The served my food and then I didn't see anyone again.... until I they had the bill.  I ordered the ribs and they were hard as a rock.  I ordered two sides and got only one.  No refills.  I wasn't about to go get a server when 5 of them were standing behind the counter gossiping.    The worst part is that the supervisor gave someone a tongue-lashing in front the limited people in there.  It was very uncomfortable.    AVOID.  Lemonade stands are more professional."}
{"text":"Food is ok..  environment  needs some serious help.. Maybe a good cleaning would make it taste better... The service was less than good.. the employee was stuck to her phone....  Maybe spending 30.00 in a bar without liquor.. you would expect more... l know I do..  Food is decent...  pizza was good.. salad was very commercial... just looks like it lacks caring...  good to go if no one else is open.. but easy to drive by and go where people care... and the employees just don't have a phone glued to their head....."}
{"text":"Terrible experience! To sum up, bad service, they got order wrong, and food was cooked poorly, read on for details.   Order on a Friday night at 6:56pm (actually hung up at 6:59pm). Lady on the phone was great in telling me about specials and prices. It was all downhill from there though.  I was told it would be 20-25 minutes on the phone. I was out shopping with my family so it was perfecting timing. I arrived at exactly 25 minutes. I told them my name and paid for my order at 7:24 to the same person that took it on the phone (could tell by her accent), which at that time I was told it would be another 3-4 minutes. She then walks back into the restaurant area only to be seen once going to the table of what seemed to be the only people inside. 9 minutes goes by until another server walks over to answer the phone. When she gets off, I tell her I was told it would be 3-4 minutes and it's been 10. With a bit of attitude she tells me she will go check. She comes back out and says it will be another 5 minutes. I explain how its going past 35 minutes and was told it would be 20-25 on the phone. Her response with still a bit of attitude summed up was, well we're really busy and I am not the one that told you that.   Now my family is waiting in the car so, I think the heck with this and demand my money back instead. She then says she has to go find my receipt. Now the original person that took my order then comes out with the order and starts to argue about how longs it's actually been, showing me she on said receipt she put in the order at 7:02, and that I paid for it at 7:24. And that when she told me 3-4 minutes she thought i was someone else who had an order for the same amount. I show her my phone which says 7:37. (Yes over 40 minutes after I originally called) They ask whether I still want my money back. I do but I'm sure my family is hungry, so I take the food and say I hope its great, cause the service (expletive) sucks. Hindsight is 20/20, I should have took the money. The pizza I ordered was undercooked, and the wings were overcooked, which I didn't even order wings, I ordered fingers.  Now most of my anger about bad service could have been avoided, if I was not left waiting 9 minutes without anyone coming back to say it would be a bit longer, or wasn't getting attitude from other person i ask to see why its taking so long."}
{"text":"Order few times before and liked the pizza but last two times was not like I remember it so tonight' I gave them another chance,  Well the  Pizza arrive after 2 hours again cold and not fresh at all!  If you want to enjoy your pizza then that's not the place."}
{"text":"the pizza is bullshit. cold. the cheese tasted sour and disgusting.  this ashley chick \"manager\" was a total  thunder twat 3000.  the delivery guy was clearly high off something his hands were shaking as he held the pizza box and the sweating ughhh gross!  don't come here. don't order."}

{"text":"We've been ordering from Angelina's for several years and have always liked their pizza.  Saturday night we ordered a plain cheese 18\" pizza, it had been a few mos. since we'd had it as we've been sticking to our New years Resolutions to lose weight.  What in God's name has happened to this place??  We were sooooo disappointed with the pizza that we were really looking forward to!!  It was a thin as a credit card and the normally chewy crust that they show in their picture was brittle, and crunchy.  I'm from NY and it's taken so long to find a pizza place that reminded me of NY pizza...this was it.  They really should be ashamed of themselves to let a pizza like we go leave the store.  Onto the next supposed NY style pizza place for us..."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! Came to dine in.... Waited 30 minutes for beverages, 45 minutes for pizza, and at 1 hour we still don't have our apps....  They seem to have 3 people at the takeout counter, and no dedicated waitresses for eat-in. One person took our order, another brought our drinks (after I went to counter and asked for them), and another brought pizza.   People coming in for takeout trump those sitting at tables. We were told they would comp part of our meal and add desserts.... In the end, waitress brought wrong bill, and then seemed confused when I said it wasn't ours. I have never wanted to dine and dash so badly! She finally came with a stack of receipts (none ours) and then wrote on the receipt, $12.   Food would get 5 stars, garlic balls are delicious... Would maybe try takeout, but NEVER eat in again..."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Great food, great service....the manager is very sweet!  My favorite is the wings with extra sauce and a side of their homemade ranch sooo delicious. I have had the philly steak sandwich very good! Of course the pizza it's thin enough to hold your toppings and the toppings are delicious."}
{"text":"By far some of the best pizza I've had. The sauce is super rich and flavourful. 10/10"}
{"text":"When I called to place the order the woman who answered the phone was nice and pleasant but had to repeat my address several times (english wasn't her first language) and I was a new customer.   I ordered the 14\" pizza with 2 sandwiches special for $21.99. They said it would take about 30-40 minutes - I called them after waiting for an hour and she could only tell me that the driver had already left. They finally arrived at 1 hour and 19 minutes after I ordered.   I ordered sausage mushroom pizza, tuna sandwich and Philly cheese steak. The pizza wasn't hot so I heated it in the toaster oven and was still pretty good. The tuna fish was really good as the bread was fresh. The cheese steak filling was sparse and after sitting for awhile got a little soggy. I'm pretty sure it would've tasted good if it didn't take them so long to have it delivered.   Based on my experience from other Angelina's I'll order from them again but will suck it up and pick it up from the Angelina's on Post Street."}
{"text":"Can't wait for my pizza. The women who answered the phone was not rude and sarcastic at all.... Yes, I've already contacted the health department about this pizza. Hopefully the owners know"}
{"text":"This place was really great. We are from st Louis and used yelp to look up some late night delivery. The food arrived hot and fresh in a reasonable time period at 2 am. Had bacon and pineapple pizza and the garlic balls. Both were awesome. Was also at a great price, very reasonable. I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Bad, bad, bad service.  Went in on a Saturday evening for pizza.  Service was so slow, forgot appetizer, and then pizza took a ridiculously long time.  We were one table of four so would have expected normal service time.  One of the kids spilled their water.  I asked for help and was handed a wet towel.  I do think that our waitress was trying but she had no support from anyone around her.  Will not dine there again."}
{"text":"Had heard alotta things about this pizza so I thought I would finally give it a try and I think the pizza you get premade at the grocery store is 10× better. This crust was as thing as you can get and bland I ended up throwing away almost half of it.  And I got the 20 wing special to go with it and the wings were dry and not much taste. And I can't the staff was overly friendly at all. So bottom line 1st and last time they will get my business"}
{"text":"One problem with pizza is that a lot of pizza doesn't have much flavor on its own. This place brings the flavor. Went there last night and picked up an authentic white pizza and was pleasantly surprised with good flavors. Not overloaded with toppings and the cheese tastes really fresh. Thin crust with just the right amount of crispy. Will definitely be going back and trying some other selections in the future."}
{"text":"We placed an order at 11:52am, delivery timeline was 35-40 minutes at 1 we called and they said they has gotten a \"lunch time rush\". At 1:30pm the delivery driver showed up. Not a friendly man, not an apology about the delay, nothing. Most our food was cold, sodas were flat and watery. Someone could have called to let us know about the delay, something should have been done to make this right for us and it wasn't. 5 of us in our office order and I can assure you, none of us will again, and neither will the rest of our office."}
{"text":"Their pizza is great, but the customer service is not. It always takes over an hour when you have them deliver the food, and if you go to pick it up they'll at times tell you they sent it out to be delivered because they didn't pay attention on the slip if it was delivery or take out. I've also ordered before on their website and had my food not delivered at all and when I called the restaurant (multiple times) no one answered the phone. Luckily my card was never charged. I used to order from here at least once every month or two, but I've quit ordering because of the hit or miss issues with them."}

{"text":"My family hasn't eaten inside the restaurant, we've only gotten delivery several times. However, we are not at all pleased. We live inside Seven Hills, but somehow our order tonight took 1 hour and 20 minutes. Really? They're always rather slow, but that's obscene.   The food is average, and basically just good enough to satisfy. Nothing to brag about. Granted, I've eaten fairly simple things from them - Calamari, Mozzarella sticks, and breaded mushrooms. I'm a pretty light eater, yes.   Tonight I was terribly hungry though, and stepped it up to order their Nachos Supreme. You know, the kind of Nachos where you're supposed to get a wonderfully messy concoction of flavors and textures piled on and within a mountain of chips?  Yeah... no. My \"Nachos Supreme\" was basically movie theater nachos. Chips, and nacho cheese. Literally the cheese you get with your theater chips, or that you dip your soft pretzels in. So much of it, in fact, I couldn't see chips in there at first. Where's the Supreme? Sure, there were a couple pieces of tomato in there, some black olives, and massive chunks of chicken that were completely illogical to eat in one bite since they were roughly the size of the chip itself. Has this restaurant ever SEEN a real plate of nachos? There was absolutely no sour cream in sight, and they don't offer guacamole, but even if they had managed to slip those in there it *still* wouldn't have saved this sadly disguised box of theater nachos. It was disgusting.   The rest of my family has not complained about the pizzas, chicken, or meatball sub. As I said before, my selection of appetizers is barely average. Especially considering breaded mushrooms and mozzarella sticks are typically the same wherever you go. It's the sauce that makes a difference, and theirs is unexciting. I will mention, their calamari was unusually fishy tasting tonight - but perhaps it's been a while since I've had calamari in general.   We'll be moving within a few months, and will no longer be in their delivery range. Thank god. I don't expect to ever go out of my way to eat at the actual establishment. You'd think that for a city where original, local businesses are hard to find among the big name chains, they'd want to work a little harder at quality."}

Garlic balls: you mean, little pieces of bread sent down from the holy italian gods, drenched in butter. Seriously,  so so bomb.   Spaghetti and meatballs: best spaghetti I've had IN VEGAS. The sauce is so delicious and fresh, and non greasy, if I could rate 10 stars for that, I totally would.  Delivery: I ordered through eat24.com, they are always fast, efficient and happy."}
{"text":"What a disgrace. We ordered delivery late at night on a Friday. Simple order of a large Stromboli. It arrived at the bar with no plates no utensils and cold. If it was delivered properly it probably would have been a good bite to eat but they were too lazy do it right. I will never give them a second chance"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the pizza and wings at Angelina's. It's a little pricey, so we always pick up the order instead of delivery to avoid additional charges. The pizzas are really big and the sweet chili wings are so yummy! I love the ranch too!"}
{"text":"After 2nd experience, not worth it.  1st delivery very quik!  Instead of ranch, they gave me Italian & no peppercini's as requested.  Delivery guy said tip wasn't included, but online receipt says yes, tho I tipped more anyway because he didn't have the right change.   2nd time, I placed my order @ 5:20p, eta 6:15-25p & they didn't show up until 7:15p!  By then the chicken fingers, fries & fried zucchini were soggy.  They are less than 2miles from me btw."}
{"text":"I've ordered here many times before . The first time I've ordered the pizza ,wings were amazing . Delivery time was great,but just recently the past times I ordered it hasn't been good. Pizza was too cold . Delivery time was too long. Pizza doesn't taste the same like it use to be."}
{"text":"Excellent  wings at a great price. Cobb Salad is huge and tasty.  Pizza ....order the 24 inch with plenty to take home. Great thin crust with lots of fresh ingredients.  Eating in or take-out, the Staff is very attentive and friendly. They do delivery too."}
{"text":"Pizza was ok however not worth the 90 minute delivery time. Don't tell me its an hour when you know you are slammed. Won't be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Good was great! They gave us extra wings and the garlic knots were different but interesting.. However the order takes over an hour! Just late delivery times was our only Issue- so don't order late at night and expect to go to bed on time which was our mistake! Everything else was great, just only choose this if it's the only place open."}
{"text":"Angelinas has gone into business with GrubHub. Angelina cooks, GrubHub delivers. Through the GrubHub website, I ordered a pizza from Angelinas,  that was never delivered. Turns out Angelinas said I was too far away and they transferred my order to another Angelina's who claimed never to have received it. Three hours later GrubHub told me my order was canceled and I would be refunded. I called Angelina's and asked who takes responsibility for glitches like this? I was told that Nicole from corporate will call me, shortly. That didn't happen either.  Don't know what the food is like  - customer service is nonexistent. GrubHub couldn't care less either."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Burgers are huge. Wedgies are excellent. The pizza crust is the best I've had around here. Everything is fresh! Cannot complain! Free delivery is great..the delivery men are friendly."}
{"text":"The best pizza. Thank you Angelina's pizza, grate and fast customer service,overall quality is  A+++. Thank you again and defiantly recommend."}
{"text":"There are many great pizza shops in Pittsburgh ! But this is not one of them. The crust was soft, cheese very greasy and the sauce is as good as Vinny's which is rubbish ! We got a pepperoni pizza didn't  like it could not eat it. I will not be ordering from here again !"}
{"text":"I don't get all the bad reviews on this place. My friend and I decided to go here for lunch, despite some of the awful reviews. I'm glad we actually looked on Yelp first because we knew from the pictures that we had to have the garlic balls. Their menu just lists the food, no pictures. We ordered the garlic balls which came out first and were super impressed at the quantity. $3.99 for a huge plate that could easily be an appetizer for 5 people. We split an 8 inch pizza and an order of hot chicken fingers with fries. Everything was delicious! The chicken fingers are smothered in that mouth watering buffalo sauce and the pizza was cheesy and fresh. Service was on point too, the waitress asked if it was our first time there and kept checking how we liked everything. Then the bill comes and it was only $21! For garlic balls, chicken fingers with fries, an 8 inch pizza, and two sodas. Literally can't beat it and we will be back again."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem! I've been to all the great pizza places in the area...Fiores, Betos, Gennaros and this little place is now on my list as my new favorite First time here and got the Fisherman's pizza...fantastic. Great sauce, lots of cheese, and plenty of delicious toppings shrimp, onions etc...The tomatoes really made it extra tasty.  All toppings were fresh,  plentiful, and yummy. The crust is just right not doughy and flavorful. Also got cigar appetizer, very yummy. Can't wait to try the dessert pizzas."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town so we couldn't venture out but decided to try this place out and have it delivered. We ordered 2 servings of the coconut shrimp with fries and a two litre of rootbeer. ABYSMAL!!! The coconut shrimp was burned as if it just returned from hell and it tasted like char. The fries were limp and plain, I understand they have plain fries and seasoned but there wasn't the slightest bit of salt and they tasted and had the texture of being microwaved. Probably because they were placed in a Styrofoam container on top of tissue liner as soon as they were expelled from the depths of hell along with the coconut shrimp and the condensation from the box after the hour and a half delivery wilted them beyond edible consumption. Oh! The cocktail sauce comes in a packet IF you can find it underneath the food and tissue liner. The root beer also resembled a product of hell as it was hot as well. No napkins, no receipt, no good!"}
{"text":"SCAM!!!! Had a coupon for free pizza if I order more then $15-I order medium pizza($22!!) and told EVA on the phone that I have a free pizza she says no problem. The delivery guy arrived with only one pizza I ask where is the free he says he don't know.i called again and EVA answer I ask her where is my FREE pizza she says that she forget to add it.  I told her ok send me one for free or let me come tomorrow with the receipt to pick up it- AND THEN she give the stupid answer ever\" i already print the receipt I can't type it in\" Whattttt???? Are you kidding me!?!?! She ask the \"manger\" and he says I cannot . For the pizza IT WAS COMPLETELY AVG! I can tell you that Dominos even taste better then that... BEST IN VEGAS it's says everywhere- probably it's not because of their quality no more it's because they pay money to get this title otherwise I had no idea how they won!!! I will put my store everywhere and will post it even on Facebook!!! Poor customer device!"}
{"text":"Ordered for the first time off of Grub Hub. Portions were very large and the order came early!"}
{"text":"Great pizza here been coming here for a while always have good customer services. Alicia is ever kind and generis. I alway ordered the same thing new complain"}
{"text":"This place is a joke for lunch. We have been here for over 40 minutes waiting on fried food and we are the only table here. You guys really need to change your whole staff. Just so you know we are still waiting."}
{"text":"friendly service bu horrible pizza.  somewhat dirty"}
{"text":"used to get delivery from here....we only eat cheese pizza  after a few deliveries, the next pizza was soggy, box was wet looking and dough not cooked  called them to explain and the lady (who is always rude on the phone) huffed and puffed and put me on hold for 20+ minutes  a manager finally got on phone and was impatient and said he would send out another........an hour later a burnt looking pizza came to door..........  no thanks jerks"}
{"text":"Everyone was too drunk to drive and so we wanted to see what was open past midnight and could deliver to us.  We found Angelina's and thought we would give it a try.  We ordered 3 sandwiches and a bacon cheeseburger...yeah, probably not what you're supposed to order from a pizzeria, but what we were craving.  We received our delivery a little past one and the food was still warm.  Everything was as ordered and everything was surprisingly tasty.  We even liked the burger re-heated the next day (something neither of us ever enjoy, no matter where the burger is from).  The delivery driver was very polite and even reminded us that our garage door was open.  We will be ordering from here again and may try some of their other sandwich and burger selections."}
{"text":"I stopped ordering from places like this because the food is usually of fair quality and the work out to burn the calories are not worth it. today I realized I didn't have anything to make for dinner. Feeling lazy I had the kids look for flyers around the house. the only one they found was for this establishment so I figured I would just give it a try considering a cheeseburger and fries was only $5.49. I went ahead and got the  small cheese pizza and I got some chicken strips when I realized they had flavors like wing stop did. it took an hour for it to get here (they mustve been busy tonight). The food was cold/warm (this is why I dropped a star and they are less then 5 mins away). However with that said you really get good food for the price. the burgers were of decent size, not to mention it did taste good. I happen to like the pizza. Its not all dough and its not oily and the texture of the crust is perfect. Now for the chicken fingers!!! I LOVE Wing stop but I have to say this place just knocked it out the park! their chicken strips are wayyyyyy better then wing stops! they are thick, meaty and moist. the flavor is phenomenal! They make wing stop look like the mcdonalds of wings and strips! Not to mention they are honest with their portions. I ordered a 3 piece with fries and I got 4 pieces because 1 was smaller then the others. will definitely be adding this to my places of regulars to order from. I'm so sick and tired of Papa Johns in anthem screwing up the orders all the time. this is my new pizza place, papa johns can suck it."}
{"text":"We get the turkey triple deck sandwich all the time! Unfortunately tonight I received spoiled turkey on the sandwich. It smelled like it was just becoming spoiled but none the less still not the best turkey for any sandwich. I loved the sandwiches until today so I will no longer order for here. At least for the time being. Sorry"}
{"text":"I am very pleased with Angelina's pizza and delivery. The food is always fresh and hot. The cheese bread is out of bounds delicious! You could honestly just get an order of that and I guarantee you will be satisfied! I made a lil sampler plate and it was thoroughly enjoyable! Thanks for always having a great presentation and even better tasting pizza, wings and cheese bread."}
{"text":"For lunch yesterday we ordered delivery through their online service. About an hour after ordering I still hadn't received a confirmation email for our order so I called to see if they even received it. The guy who answered said yes they had and that was it....no offering up an ETA or anything.   So another 30 min passes and finally the food arrives (this place is literally less than a mile from our office so I figured they must have been really busy which is why it took so long). I was willing to ignore the fact it took so long to get to us (ordered just before 12pm and didn't arrive until about 1:30 I think it was) until we dug into the food.  We ordered a special which had a 18\" pizza with one topping and 10 chicken fingers. The pizza we got was bordering luke warm bath water temperature and cold. So we had to heat up our slices before we ate them. And the chicken was the same temp, not even hot!! AND they were dry! Ordered them mild and they were still looking like a plain chicken finger! We also ordered fries with cheese which was the only piping hot item we received and was actually pretty good (we thought); they used nacho cheese, yum.   My two stars are for the ranch and cheese fries because they were the only things we truly enjoyed. Will not be back here. Unless I feel like burning $39 for cold food."}
{"text":"Called to order chicken wings and fries from the lady doing the orders from the phone she was rude and kept putting me on hold when I started ordering. Then the wait which was suppose to be 45 minutes turned out to be longer then that because the driver couldn't find my address despite me telling him the cross streets.  Finally get my food and the chicken wings are dry and there is more bone then meat on the wings and the fries were overcooked I threw it out I can't believe I wasted 30 bucks on that with the mozzarella sticks which was the only good thing pathetic avoid this place at all cost."}
{"text":"Great food. Very helpful staff. Delivery times may vary but the food is worth the wait. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"I visited Angelina's for the first time in several months, and was disappointed. The food was inexpensive and just okay, maybe less.  There was no health grade in sight, so who knows, but a fly kept bugging us while eating. The waitress or maybe waiter, because they changed off, never came back to refill our drinks after delivering our food.  After we finally got our check we waited to have it collected, but they never came, so we walked up with it. They took the checks and one person in my party received a $10 bill as change on a just under $10 check, so after the bad service no tip because he surely was not going to leave a $10 100% tip after the bad service.   We are all 20% plus tippers regularly."}
{"text":"Don't order online; $28 and a hour later I received a raw mushy pizza... only the outside crust was cooked.  Lil ceasers $5 hot and ready seams to be worth the drive!"}
{"text":"This was my first time to eat at Angelina's  Pizzeria.  We arrived without a reservation with about 20 people.  We were celebrating my son in-laws College Graduation and Granddaughters  14th Birthday.   We were greeted, seated, and had multiple orders placed (all different checks) which by the way was not an issue.  Our server was Chanel and Jacob also helped out as we were a pretty large party.  Both were friendly and extremely helpful The food arrived hot, very tasty, and the  portions were large.  We all ordered different menu items, each of which were just as delicious  as the next.   I have to say that was a very positive experience and would definitely return to this business again."}
{"text":"This was the only pizza place near us that was open at and delivered at 2 am. Arrived within an hour and was very good!"}
{"text":"This is our new favorite pizza spot in Brookline.  You can find us there picking up pizza most Fridays and in the winter we are getting it delivered (usually right on time or early).  The Angelina's supreme pizza is our favorite which comes with peperoni, bacon, sausage, peppers, onions and mushrooms.  The toppings are fresh, the pizza is not to greasy and the dough is tasty!  This past visit we tried one of their sandwiches-they have a pretty extensive menu and many other items including burgers and hoagies.  The buffalo chicken sandwich was huge and pretty tasty. I also ordered a side of breadsticks. I was a bit disappointed with the breadsticks as they were pretty bland and needed something else.  Next time I'll try the cheesy bread."}
{"text":"Worst service!! Food comes late... soggy and cold. They won't make it right!! Really you can't give me ranch that I asked for?! We keep giving changes to make it right and they just making excuses. Don't order here!"}
{"text":"The pizza is so good here. I'm eating my leftovers as we speak. Nom nom nom!!I've never been disappointed. Thanks you guys!"}
{"text":"I love Angelina's. Great service, prices, and food. The delivery service is always amazing, accurate and on time."}
{"text":"I'm a regular at some of the other Angelina's location and a little iffy about going to this one. I recently relocated on this side of town and thought hey why not give it a shot.  The WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! JUST STAY AWAY! NOT WORTH THE TIME NOR THE MONEY.   I ordered through phone and first off she didn't introduce and he was completely unprepared during the order and had an attitude during the whole time. She didn't ask me if my order was complete and just gave me the price and heaved a loud sighed when I added something to my order. Talk about unprofessional.   I walked in and walked to the counter; at the other locations if they were busy they would greet me a warm hello and tell  me they would be right with me. A girl with black rimmed glasses (the one who actually took my order because I recognized her voice) told me she'll be right with me with a very sassy attitude. DID NOT APPRECIATE THAT AT ALL. The other host that was there however was every helpful and was really cheerful so that made up for it a bit.  My order was ready and I drove home to only find out my order was incomplete! I called them back and they said they can just add the fact that my order was incomplete onto my profile. The girl who picked up the phone this time around was very nice and kept apologizing (she was the other coworker that was with the rude girl. Their were only 2 of them there.)   I gave it one star because that girls attitude just doesn't cut it for me for anything higher than that."}
{"text":"10/8/17 Had dinner there, good food, very reasonable price.  I recommend.  Don't really understand the bad reviews that wasn't my experience. The server was very friendly."}
{"text":"The customer service is always great and the food is as well. Very generous portions and there's a large selection on the menu. Everything I've ordered has met or exceeded my expectations- I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I can't speak on their delivery because I order through a delivery app but I can comment on the pizza which is pretty damn good. Big slices, great dough, and huge choice of toppings. The wings are good, the calzones and strombolis are amazing. Ive probably ordered from here a dozen or more times since spring and it has been consistently good. It's my go to pizza joint."}
{"text":"We eat lunch here quite often because its closest to work and we have a short lunch break. no two visits are the same. Our most recent was one of those visits we were very disappointed in. Double cheeseburger, no cheese. Brown wilted lettuce. No mayo. Patty overcooked. Asked for ranch and salt and pepper and got neither. Just don't get delivery. Make sure its what you actually ordered"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place! We usually get the burgers or chicken strips. Their fries are AMAZING. I have also ordered catering. The baked ziti was much better than the chicken parm but it was still good overall. The employees are always nice to us too. It seems the delivery service is what people complain about, just go in and order! Also try the zeppolis."}
{"text":"Called in the order, which took me 15 min to get there and after waiting 35 more minutes, I didn't receive an apology for the wait from a lady that looks she was owner or just a frustrated manager. The young lady that took my order apologized and that why I'm giving 2 stars. Pizza was ok and price was ok, but service Terrible! At least by management."}
{"text":"We really had hoped this would be our new favorite pizza place having moved here recently.  The pizza itself is pretty good - and I'm sure its even better when its warm and fresh.  We placed a pick up order on Friday around 6.  They told us it would be about 30 minutes - which is a little long, but we thought 'hey, they must be busy - which is good'.  We ordered two pizzas and when we got there they weren't quite ready so we waited a few minutes.  The restaurant only had about four tables seated so I am guessing most of their business must be take out.  There was a seemingly new person on the register because the other person at the counter was telling her about a 'regular' that just called in etc.  No big deal - we waited about 5 minutes, they called my name and handed us the pizzas.  I should listen to the little voice in my head that said 'check the pizzas' - even though the girl at the counter did.  But I didnt.  We got home and discovered they had one of the pizza's wrong.  So we called -and the girl 'Alicia' who had been training the other at the counter answered.  She apologized and said we could either get a credit on the account or come get a new pizza AND they would give us a free dessert or 2L of soda for our inconvenience.  Ok - it was a bit of a hassle as we live about 15 minutes away -but back we went.  Interestingly the Alicia said it would only take 13 minutes to cook a new one.  But less than five minutes later we got a call saying our pizza was ready.  It was ready most likely because it was the original one that sat there now for over 30 minutes.  My husband went into the restaurant to pick it up.  What he witnessed was either an ill equipped manager or ill equipped owner YELLING at employees behind the counter - very unprofessional.  She was rude and inappropriate.  When my husband stated he was there to pick up the pizza - he got a handful of attitude from the staff when he asked about their offer of dessert.  He told them fine - I'll take the 2L.  Walking out, he had to walk through the cigarette smoke of two of the delivery guys who were chatting about how slow it was.   Needless to say, we wont go back - and based on other reviews you might seriously consider yourself warned.  Pizza is decent - but too many places around town for crappy attitudes and bad service."}
{"text":"been coming here for years & lately I've been super disappointed with the food & service. unfortunately won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"Man, it makes me sad to see negative reviews for this place!  I've been here a bunch and it's always been great.  Good pizza, a nice little drink menu, good customer service, cute little ambiance.    Not bad for a small local business.  I'll continue to support Angelina's!"}
{"text":"Awesome garlic balls.  There home made marinara is to due for and phillys are great.   Beautiful atmosphere and great service."}
{"text":"Awesome place,  awesome food,  the garlic balls rock,  and the service is so friendly"}
{"text":"We got the wings! While we are at putters bar they deliver food straight to us! The hot wings were great! I want to get more now as I write this review... WOW!   The people here are nice and friendly - the server is great, plus she's hot. I'm not that into other girls but seriously had thought about it.  Their pizza is decent and their salads are great - especial their chef salad"}
{"text":"Ordered chicken parmigiana and it was amazing! It came with homemade garlic bread which was also very tasty. The portion size was very hearty, definitely enough for 2 or more people"}
{"text":"11/11/2017  24\" Angelina's Special Pizza ordered at 12:30am it was delivered stone cold at 2:20am. A very disappointing experience. Not getting my LVRJ 2017 Vote. Not gonna happen."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery. I was in a hurry and thought I give them a chance... should have considered the reviews.... $40 for a margarita pizza, greek salad and a jalapeno popper. Considering $40 and a simple Margarita pizza... the product was inferior and not worth the price. I felt cheated with the product and the price. Pizza was soggy and cold... I had better frozen pizza from my local frozen grocery section. Sad..."}
{"text":"HOLY STROMBOLI!!! Well, we had a Calzone, BUT WTF IT WAS GREAT!!!!!  Post band practice meal, so we were hungry for junky food.  20 wings AND our server happy did 4 in a sauce that we just wanted to try. A medium calzone, rated to feed 2-3 people... IT WAS HALF A PIZZA!!!  There about 40 combo specials for pizza, wings, finger fries and more. IT IS ALL DELICIOUS!! The dough is garlicy and soft. The sausage is perfect.  It's a bar and may not be good for kids. The food came out quick and was great. The servers were friendly and extremely helpful. They didn't miss a thing, brought us a pitcher of water and kept the napkins coming.  I will stop in here for TO GO wings in the future. Also, I'll be bringing more people from the studio over.  GREAT JOB!! Gotta try the pizza next time."}
{"text":"TWO HOURS for 6 little lunch special pizzas?! From a place literally right around the corner? And the worst pizza I've ever had, too. Never, ever ever again."}
{"text":"Came with a group of friends to Vegas to celebrate our friends birthday. We arrived at about 11:30 PM after a near give hour drive from Los Angeles and we were hungry. So we ordered ourselves some pizza. Pizza came right on time and it was delicious. In fact it was so delicious we ended up ordering pizza again two nights later. Overall, it was a good price for good pizza. Delivery was on time and that's huge considering we were ordering around midnight."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely awesome! I ordered from them through the Eat24 app and they delivered earlier than the quoted time. The food was fantastic but halfway through my salad I realized that they brought me the wrong soup. I ordered Pasta Fagioli and they brought me Italian Wedding. I hate Italian Wedding! I called them to let them know and they apologized and said they would bring me a new soup. They quoted me another 20 minutes but five minutes later a driver was at my door with my soup! It was the first time I had ever tried their Pasta Fagioli and I am so excited to say that, after years of searching for something like my Grandfather used to make, I have finally found it! Best Pasta Fagioli I have ever had, besides Grandpa's."}
{"text":"I suppose when ordering a burger from a pizzeria, my expectations were not the highest. I did not however, expect to receive a previously frozen meat Patty that was over cooked and fries that had been cooked in dirty oil.  Ordered from door dash: I specifically asked for salt and pepper on the Patty and to be cooked medium. The burger was cooked well done and no seasoning."}
{"text":"Was not very good. Ordered grilled chicken club sandwich and I don't know where they get their chicken from but it was nasty. The texture of the chicken was like hard gristle throughout. You couldn't even pull the chicken apart. Probably will stay away from this place."}
{"text":"My family and I were on vacation this past weekend we decided on pizza for dinner. I believe this place use to be in the Riviera and we loved the pizza there. This place looks sketchy af. I understand the bar idea but the pizza side is not well lit and from the vibe you would think that no kids were allowed. The cashier was a little busy when we got there with the phones and take out orders but she was nice. We were told 20-25 minutes but it was more like 35-40. When we got back to the hotel we discovered one of our pizzas were not cut. The only reason my rating is high is only because the pizza is so good. Next time I'm in town I'll make sure to phone my order in and take my time picking it up."}
{"text":"This is our go to pizza spot when ordering for our company lunches. The food is always consistent and delicious and the portions are generous for the cost when feeding 10+ grown men.   Our go to items are the build your own pizzas (24\" for around $28), the 100 wings (2-3 different flavors around $50) and a half tray side salad ($20).   Everything is always made fresh and the salad is always good fresh produce. They always meet our pick up time and the staff is always friendly and helps carry out all the food.   It's also a plus to be able to order everything online and have it come out exactly as ordered."}
{"text":"The food is good, but not good enough to deal with being treated like crap.   I called and placed an order, they told me it would be 45 minutes. The delivery address is less than half a mile away. When I finally received a phone call from the delivery driver  two hours later he stated he had been sitting in the parking lot for ten minutes waiting on someone.  The instructions that were given said to call when he arrived so someone was able to come get him.   Then the order was almost $50 and they offer free delivery on orders over $30, but very deceptively don't tell you this part, that you have to ask for it!!!! It's in the fine print. Oh, and he forgot the garlic balls that we ordered so he had to go back and get those.   So upon calling back, the manager George was very rude on the phone and told me if I wasn't happy I could call corporate. When I asked him for the number he said if I wanted I could look it up online and that he would not get it for me.   I looked the number up and called corporate, left a message for the BOSS?? And have yet to get a call back. Apparently George learned his customer service skills from the top.   They obviously don't value their customers, even the ones that order on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever standing in front counter for 20 minutes then A lady told me are you here to picking up very rude I'm sorry you lost a customer I'll never go back"}
{"text":"First time customer, some of the worst food in Vegas. Hamburger bun was cold and dried out. It fell apart in my hand. The burger was tasteless. No seasoning, just fried meat. The burger was brought out last and you could tell it was cold just by its appearance. The fettuccine had smelly shrimp. You can't just take refrigerated shrimp and mix it in the pasta. You have to sauté it, which this wasn't. The wings were ok and the French fries hot but slightly undercooked and too salty. The noise in this place made it intolerable. The waitstaff were ok but overall the food quality was just downright poor. We didn't eat much of the food but took it home and threw it out."}
{"text":"Reasons to order from here: Lazy Late delivery hours Moderate pricing  Reasons to not order from here: Not Lazy Other places are open Willing to pay a tad more for better quality food"}
{"text":"In town visiting relatives ordered on recommendations. Ordered food online pizza & garlic balls for delivery.  When order arrived it pizzas toppings were wrong. Immediately called to inform and guy on phone knew exactly which pizza was ours and what we were calling about. Apologized and sent a new one out. Impressed with service. Food was good- service was better! Try garlic balls-great"}
{"text":"This place is sooo slow do not come here if you have plans for the day or on lunch. Food is mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Ordered a chicken sandwich and got tomato and lettuce on a bun. There was a chicken nugget in the lettuce pile tho. So small was the meat that I had to go eat again after. Threw most of the sandwich out cause there was only enough chicken to eat half of it. Lame."}
{"text":"Pizza was awesome. wings not so great but the pizza was worth the trip and the waitress kept bending down and showing her boobs and looked very trashy . So its not bad for a quick lunch"}
{"text":"Their pizzas are huge, they're inexpensive, and they taste amazing. I get their large cheese pizza with basil and it never disappoints. Staff has always been real cool and relaxed too. When I'm getting pizza for more than just me, this is my go to place."}
{"text":"Ordered a medium pizza and 12 piece wings last night. Wait time was normal not too bad. I was really disappointed in the quality of the pizza. It looked and tasted like it hadn't been cooked long enough the dough was slightly raw and every time I picked up a slice all of the toppings fell off which forced me to eat it with a fork for the most part. I wouldn't mind a longer wait time if they would have just cooked the damn pizza properly. The wings on the other hand were pretty good. It was definitely overpriced for what I got. Im mostly giving this place two stars  because they didn't cook the pizza long enough."}
{"text":"I came to Vegas to party.  Butt it turned out i also came to desire late night pizza.  I ordered 2 times from this place over a 3 night span.  The first time i ordered at 12. at night.  Pizza came right about when they said it was.  Around 45 minutes.  The next time i ordered was around 9.  (Gotta get that preclub pizza.)  Again right at around 45 which is exactly the time they said it would take.  Pizza was good.  Beats dominoes any night of the week.  I see a lot of bad reviews on this place.  Seems they all have a common theme.  Ordering non pizza items.  I know that if they sell it they should be able to make it properly but its kinda a what did you expect type of deal.  Im not ordering a gyro or a burger from this place.   I'm ordering pizza.  And as for the pizza it was good.  Also the delivery guy was really nice."}
{"text":"First time coming in .  Restaurant is clean and inside Putter's Bar .  Got the 14 inch pepperoni and chicken wings for $20 .  Staff were nice and I get their flyers all the time so decided to give them a try .  They have lots of special and a big menu to choose from ."}
{"text":"The worst service ever. first time I ate at this locating there was an eyelash on my canoli. Silly me I gave them a second chance and had food delivered which my wings order was wrong. So I called and spoke to the manager. At first he was polite and after I informed him the issue and them once he came back to the phone his attitude changed. He said hid cook said he made the order right and started yelling at me. I asked him why was he yelling at me...his response was because I was upset. I told him that is not how you handle someone who is upset. A few days later I called the corporate number since the same guy owns all the ones in town. He was out of town with personal issues and was told that I would get a call back. The lady assured me since she was his sons personal assistant. She also said that the manager was new but still excuse. This happened a few months ago and never been back."}
{"text":"Ordered on Uber Eats like I do every week from here . The Philly cheese steak I ordered looked so disgusting that I immediately went there and showed them. The woman at the register had my food remade , but I can tell you I will never eat here again. The place is dirty, the employees were smoking cigarettes in the restaurant . My remade food wasn't even good, seems like they're using a new cheese that's disgusting . Never again ."}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE!!!! After waiting for our lunch specials. Our food came out cold. Our drinks were never refilled either.  The guy sitting next to us for 30 minutes never even got acknowledged until 40 minutes after her sat. The waitresses suck.  No customer service skills or personalities!  What a disappointment, I love this pizza and wings but not cold they served them."}
{"text":"I placed an order yesterday, based on a menu they dropped off at my office just a few months prior. A guy answered the phone, only to put me on hold several times before passing me onto a  girl who took my delivery order. After getting off the phone, the total didn't sit well with me.  I ordered 2 salads, an 18\" cheese pizza and an order of garlic balls. The total came out to $47 which was absurd.  Almost all of their items increased by $2-$3 over the course of maybe 3 months. I found this information by looking at their rates online. I called back and the same guy answered. I asked why I was charged the delivery fee when every menu I saw said free delivery on $30, I spent $47 and was asking for a delivery that was maybe half a mile away.  He 'placed me on a hold' or so he thought. He just put the phone down, told the woman who took my order that I wanted a refund on my delivery fee (which is NOT what I asked for) and she replied by saying, \"Bitch, really?!\" I can't believe you allow such rude and disrespectful people to be employed here. First of all, I was going off the information YOUR company had on the physical menu and online menu provided.  The food was mediocre and the service was absolutely atrocious.  I will NEVER go to Angelina's again and I plan on detering everyone who asks me about your restaurant. You're lucky your delivery driver is nice."}
{"text":"Impressed got to Vegas at 1am called and ordered a pizza and salad . Everything was delicious and they delivered didn't have to leave my hotel !"}
{"text":"I just ordered delivery for the first time . Food was on time , hot and delicious! Will definitely order again"}
{"text":"Tonight I ordered a pizza from Angelina's online for delivery to my new address in Dormont. It was called a Portuguese pizza and sounded very interesting. Their website was a bit slow but easy to navigate. I promptly got an email containing the receipt and telling me the pizza was on its way.   An hour and a half later the pizza had still not arrived. I called and asked about it. \"We haven't made that pizza in two years\", they replied. \"So why is it on your website?\" \"I don't know. We tried to call you\" (my phone was in my hand the entire time I was waiting). \"So there's no pizza coming?\" \"No, I guess not. Sorry\".   And that was it. No offer to make it right. No suggestion of another pizza. Just sorry. And click.   I wouldn't eat here if they had the last food on earth."}
{"text":"Keep giving this place chances but apparently they keep saying I'm the only that complains. What's so hard about delivering hot food and the sides that we ordered?! Worst customer service. They won't make it right so don't try."}
{"text":"Good food but horrible delivery.  This is the fourth time my order was wrong.  They usually forget something.  This time we waited 40 min to get the wrong wings.  When we called we were told don't eat those we'll get you the right wings but it will be another 40 minutes.  Or we can get a credit for next time but they still need to pick up the wrong wings.   Then we were told the driver mixed up and was on his way back with our order and would pick-up the food we got in a few minutes.  Considering we opened the bag and boxes I hope he's not going to deliver them to someone else.  In addition we need to call back later to talk to a manager and it's been another 30 minutes and we don't have our food yet."}
{"text":"I came here to pick up an order there was a guy at the register no greeting. I believe they were close to closing but still doesnt give him the right to treat a costumer rudely. he had his ear phones im while completing my transaction and i had to ask him a couple of times for napkins because he couldnt hear me with his earphones in. very rude and disappointed in the service."}
{"text":"I will give 2 stars just because I have had worse pizza before. The pizza is okay and the pick up special of $7.99 for a 16 inch large cheese is good for the kids. Yesterday I called in the pick up special at 4 pm for pickup at 5:15 pm and when I showed up they said it would be another 3 minutes, 12 minutes later my pizza was ready which pretty much means they forgot to make it. I was not too happy as I was on on tight schedule which is why I  called an hour ahead of time. I could understand if they were slammed but the place was mostly empty.  Previously I have ordered the wings which were average and I also ordered a whole barbecue chicken. The BBQ chicken was so dry it almost could not be swallowed. My guess is they prepare the chicken once every couple weeks and then try and reheat later with barbecue sauce slabbed on  - really terrible chicken. The beans that came with it were served cold too.  Overall this location has poor management and would be a great candidate for a reality show such as restaurant impossible!"}
{"text":"Solid food delivery for Mt. Lebanon. After trying many different options for food delivery, we find ourselves ordering from this place again and again. Tons of options, all of which have been good.  Delivery is prompt and friendly. You can order online and view the menu at http://www.angelinas.us"}
{"text":"I luv there chicken wings & garlic balls!!! Tried other places & they don't compare! One thing I do have a problem with is they don't refill drinks when eat'n in?! Idk if it's bcuz there is a one drink minimum or if it's bcuz they aren't pay'n attention?! Either way there food is good:)"}
{"text":"Delivery took a little while, but I did order during the dinner rush. But the pizza was worth it! Seriously some of the best I've had in Vegas."}
{"text":"So five stars only because I'm giving them a try, after reading the horrible reviews on them within the past 5 months. I live in beechview right on Saranac so let's hope this goes good! I'll keep yinz updated. So the end result was awesome the lady gave me a discount the driver delivered on time and the pizza was hot and cheesy ( a lil too cheesy for me but still good). I recommend this pizza"}
{"text":"Horrible. Just ordered quest nachos with shrimp and the shrimp isn't even cooked  and their is no cheese !! Smh  and on top of that the food took an hour and a half to come. I've had better service from this place old what's going on right now ?"}
{"text":"Love this place eat here you will never be disappointed we order the same thing all the time pizza and Buffalo chicken Stromboli and a grilled chicken salad so good, and there is so much more to order I also love the hummus and everything is so well made, and people there are wonderful perfect consistency also fast delivery and the online ordering is cool to use some times I wish I could give this 10 stars because they deserve it thank you to any and all employees your hard work has made you our favorite place to order from"}
{"text":"I called to order delivery, and the lady on the phone was extremely helpful and nice. She repeated everything back to me correctly and had a very kind attitude. The food took awhile, but it was well worth the wait, the pizza was piping hot and the garlic balls were devine!! I love pizzaria's and I also worked at a very well known one, so I know what a good pizza consist of. I had a regular pepperoni, and my husband had a personal pizza. Try it, you wont regret it!!"}
{"text":"Quality food. Family friendly. Customer service is usually a hit or miss. Slightly dated interior. Overall 4 stars."}
{"text":"I just recently started ordering food from here for lunch, for now I give it a good solid 3 stars because of my experience thus far. The first time I ordered lunch I ordered the lunch special of 8 wings with fries with a coke & a 3 layer chocolate cake. Ok, so 1st issue was that I ordered my food around 11:30am...food didn't arrive until almost 1pm =/ ok cool I got over that because I was STARVING. 2nd issue, I open up my meal & realize that instead of 8 wings there was only 6 =( that highly disappointed me because I did pay for 8 not 6 but whatever. 3rd issue i finally get to the dessert & the cake looks so yummy so I'm super excited to dig in, so I taste the frosting, it was to die for, I get to the actual cake & to my surprise it is dry as heck. =/  So those are my issues with the 1st order. P.s. the wings & the wing sauce ((mild)) were pretty good. I enjoyed them.  2 days later I order again, let me make this short & quick, I ordered a much larger order because I got some of my co-workers to order as well. So we got the chicken strips & fries, spaghetti with meatballs, mozzarella sticks & fried mushrooms. Ok, the fries & strips were really good. The spaghetti was ok, not the best, but not the worst. The mozzarella sticks & the fried mushrooms were NOT good at all, the mozz stick were super dry & the mushrooms were just gross. Another issue with this time, the delivery time sucked so much, we literally waited almost an hour & then some.    Ok, moral of the story, i really like this place, yeah it has its flaws but all in all its OK. I have yet to try the pizza & some other things on the menu but honestly so far based on what I have had from there, I would say on a scale from 1-10 I'd give Angelina's a 5 1/2."}
{"text":"Great food and service. I come here every week and it's the best pizza in Vegas. Always friendly and fast."}
{"text":"I've ordered from here several times and I've never had a problem with them until recently, they called to tell me they couldn't take my order because the manager \"said so\" but never gave me an actual reason to why they couldn't this time. My problem with this place is that when the girl answered and spoke to me she was incredibly rude and had a very bad attitude, I did not get this girls name but I did call again to ask why they refused to deliver to me and a worker named Melissa answered and she too was very rude. I would never order from here again! Poor customer service."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza and the customer service is amazing! Even on a Friday night and they were super busy the service was outstanding! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The staff is awesome and Dani is a big help! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Great stuff!! I'm at work and the pizza guy was professional enough. The pizza itself was bomb, the little garlic bread is outstanding and even the marinera sauce was on point. I bought a large pizza and it fed 4 adults, average size adults I should say. But man this is like the 3rd time I order here and it's the beezneez."}
{"text":"I think that Angelina's has wonderful servers and staff. Really great pizza for the price and a fun place to bring friends, family or clients. George is a warm and welcoming manager and Nicole is amazing at handling their marketing."}
{"text":"Yep!  I am one of those \"yelpers\" when someone pisses me off! See the date on this review? This place is a joke. I had a flyer that said FREE DELIVERY when spending $30 or more- so I call and order my food and mentioned the flyer, I was put on hold and was told my total was $31 and some change and that it was an hour and 20 min wait, I said i would come instead and the girl said $28.08 was the total (so they ended up charging the $3 delivery charge anyways) whatever, right?? So I go up there and the dummy said total was $31 whatever and I was like are you kidding me, one of you guys said $28 freaking dollars- the girl started saying some bullshit about the printout of the receipt not having a delivery fee, once they brought my food out and I knew it was safe I told the re-re off and explained you can't tell a customer over the phone that it's 28 dollars and try to go back to the 31 for delivery. She must have been really slow or delayed cause she kept talking about the receipt so once I got louder they honored the $28.08. I could say so much more about this place since I know some people that work/ have worked here, but I won't besides the girl with braces is a dumb bitch lol"}
{"text":"Probably one of my favorite spots to go to for pizza and wings.  The staff is really nice and the pizza is delicious.  And their wings and really good as well.  Really good quality food at an affordable price."}
{"text":"First of all I'm a true Italian that knows good pizza. Pizza places know my name. This place is the definition of great service. Delicious food that reminds me of my Italian roots. Just like nana used to make. Everyone is extremely friendly."}
{"text":"Ordered the Calamari. It looked and tasted burnt. The stromboli...How can the cheese and the meat be cold ? The cheese wasn't even melted all the way. I took it home since it was so big and Nuked it for a minute and it did taste pretty good. I always give a place a second chance but will try something new."}
{"text":"We got white pizza, steak hoagie and Italian hoagie. Everything was delicious!! Will def get again"}
{"text":"Our server alisha is great. Very friendly, soft spoken and knowlegable about the property and the specials that they have. Food is great! Had the pizza and wings cant beat the price too."}
{"text":"Pizzas are OK. Garlic balls are the bomb, that is the reason enough for me to order from this place."}
{"text":"We got the Philly cheesesteak pizza and let's just say it was plain. Not much to it. My wife got the caesar salad she said it was good. The chi slate cake was good but the cheesecake was nasty!!! The delivery man was like 60yrs old and was not happy at all when he delivered the food. He didn't say 1 word to us when he arrived. For 30$ I expected something a little better. Oh well."}
{"text":"Ordered online, was charged for the order and given a delivery time...hours later no food and still charged with no explanation. POS place."}
{"text":"Created an order for delivery, was charged, got a confirmation email. No food ever delivered. Avoid!!"}
{"text":"I received a menu in my door today (in a non soliciting neighborhood) and decided to place a delivery order today. I put my order in and was given an outrageous total price. I asked why it was so expensive and she said its because I'm so far away so they charge a $5 delivery fee. I immediately cancelled my order lol. I don't understand there solicitation strategy. FYI I live in Ventana Canyon apartments."}
{"text":"I put an order for delivery. After an hr and twenty minutes I called to see what's taking so long. The lady told me it won't be much longer. 20 minutes later the deliver guy calls me and he can't find my address. I told the delivery guy to cancel. My place is only 10 minutes away from them and it takes them an hr and half to deliver the food. What a joke of a place. I'll never order from them again."}
{"text":"Ordered the cheeseburger twice ---DELICIOUS FRIES WERE DELICIOUS TOO--- food is good so far, had the pizza and antipasto (very good) delivered Hot and good.The servers don't mix with the customers, just too busy talking and yelling to each other. Most of them are in a daze. Hey people this is a customer business. One waitress can't talk that great, had to ask he what she said twice. Nobody looks at you even while paying the bill--------- never come back to ask if you want a refill etc. Its close to where I live and convenient------------- will try some of the other food again--- like the sandwiches--------------"}
{"text":"i live behind angelina's seven hills pizza joint. i went to have lunch today june 21st while my dog was being groomed. looked forward to a nice burger and fries. place my order with the same waitress that has been there for a long time. ordered a burger and fries. she brought me a double cheeseburger, which i did not want. she said its the same price with a coke. i told her its not the price, i just don't like a double patty. she said she would take it back i was hungry and knew i had to pick up my dog soon, so i said to take the one patty off and it will be ok. not what i ordered. she never came back to ask if i wanted a refill etc. just brought the check. told her that i had a 5.00 pizza coupon that i would like to take with me. when i got home the pizza was burnt on the bottom and tasted like cardboard. ended up tossing it out. called them and she said to bring it back and she will give another one. no not in this heat i should not have to inconvenience myself for their mistake. will not go there anymore. it is convenient if you don't drive, but worth the crap did not tip-----------------------------"}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time. I thought for the prices the food would be great. I was disappointed. I ordered online. Received an email stating I would be notified of when my order would be ready. Never received one. When I did the status check, I did not get a response either. After 45 minutes I picked up my food. The cashier was rude. The staff ignored me when I walked up to the counter while they kept on their conversation. Certainly lacking in customer service. On to the food.  No flavor to their food. Shrimp scampi was pretty much a tub of melted butter over pasta. Fettuccine sauce had no flavor. Sadly disappointed. I would have given it another try but the three salads that came with my order made me upset. All of their tomatoes were bruised/molded. Threw them in the trash. I'll never go back. I was hoping for the best. Still looking for a great local Italian spot. At this rate I'll stick with Brio or Olive Garden."}
{"text":"I ordered Delivery and it showed up timely.   I had the Pesto, Shrimp, and Tomato Pizza and it was awesome!"}
{"text":"This review is for their pizzas only. Its delicious!   A piece of advice. If you tried calling them to place an order ... good luck with ordering.... it would take lots of patience not to yell at them for keeping you waiting on the phone for over 15 mins just to order food. SOOO... do yourself a favor and order online on Yelp."}
{"text":"At work the owner buys lunch every Saturday ,I mentioned pizza and the manager at the time knew of a great place ...Angelina's in seven hills. I've never had pizza from there so I was excited. Minutes go by and a driver pulls up goes to the trunk and pulls out this huge ass pizza box. I was like holy shit!!!! I guess we ordered all meat . It was soooo good . Between my coworker and I must of had 20 pieces each. I love the pizzas here. Tonight I had a craving for some chili cheese fries but I was too late , already closed. Well I'll try to stop by earlier tomorrow ."}
{"text":"Worst pizza ever!  I ordered a $20 14\" Angelina's Special (which is a supreme with all toppings).  Thin crust but SOGGY.  Taste was like that of a frozen pizza!   I picked the pizza up and the place had a funny chemical smell in it!  What a waste of money!    Don't go there if you have any sense of good tasting pizza!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is clean andThe calamari isn't very good, but the chili queso was pretty good. We got the wings and tenders lunch combo which also comes with fries. They were very good. Lots of sauce and a great sized portion of ranch. Moscow Mules were made with ginger ale instead of ginger beer so not quite perfect, but still refreshing a tasty. The wait staff were courteous and attentive without being annoying. Food and drinks came out very fast so overall happy with the experience."}
{"text":"Lets see  Angelinas is by far my favorite place to order from in las vegas. Ive ordered from you guys at least 50 times in the last 4 years and have always got my order 100% right. Im a regular and that has benefits with them. One time you guys gave me 2 free pizzas for being a regular. I will always give you guys business. And ill always reffer you to friends, family, and anyone. Thank you for taking care of me and my family. Ill proudly support you"}
{"text":"I fell in love with the pizza at Angelia's and have bragged about this place to everyone that I know but the customer service need a LOT of help.   I've ordered pizza for the associates at my work as well as myself and family. A few weeks ago I ordered through their online system (for home) and a hour later my job called me and thanked me for the pizza (that was supposed to be delivered to my house). Not only was it awkward to let my co-workers know that it wasn't for them, I had to drive to get it and by the time I got home it was cold. This could have easily been prevented if the people that worked there payed attention to detail. Even my online confirmation email had my house address on it ;/  I called Angelina's to voice what had happened and the lady on the phone was rude and insisted that I said takeout or delivery. I told her I had a concern regarding my order and again she said \"take out or delivery\" in a rude manner. I told her it was \"delivery\" and when she finally gave me the chance to speak I told her that I had already place a order and she asked for my name. I gave her my name and she told me that it has already been delivered. It was a joke trying to have a real conversation since she was so eager to rush me off the phone. I told her that indeed it was delivered but unfortunately it was to the WRONG ADDRESS. Again, rude and she looked into and said it was her mistake. I wasn't offered anything (which I wasn't planning to get a deal- I wanted to clearly let them know what happened ) but just the fact that these people are down right rude and didn't seem to care really bothered me. If I wanted pick up... I would have proudly hopped in my car and drove down there.   I will not order from Angelina's again. If I was the owner of this location I would clean house and get people with customer service skills that care about their customers. The pizza is delicious but with people working there that are always rude, it's doesn't even matter how great the product is if you're going to treated like dirt. I hope they re-evaluate their staff and learn from some of these reviews."}
{"text":"Great tuna melt and I know you're thinking tuna melt at a pizzeria but seriously it was bomb. Their food is huge servings! You have to get the Athens fries! So good! Service was great and fast and our waitress was really nice! I definitely want to come back!"}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza online at 3:37 pm yesterday for delivery.  E-mail confirmation said 30-45 minutes but I know they've been slow in the past.  When my pizza hadn't arrived in 1 hour, I called them to inquire.  After 3 people answered my call at different times after putting me on hold for 10 minutes, I was told \"I just spoke to the driver and she's in your neighborhood\".  I waited another 20 minutes and called back when it STILL hadn't arrived!  She eventually arrived with our luke warm pizza with an excuse that she was a server and not even a delivery driver.  The woman on the phone told me how busy they were and that delivery usually runs an hour.....so basically, they took no responsibility and if delivery takes an hour normally then maybe change your e-mail confirmations to set the correct expectation!  Won't order again."}
{"text":"I think locaiton is what makes me a fan this most.. It's close by! The food is good, staff is friendly but the food service is slow.  My daughters always enjoy the pizza, which they have a variety of toppings to choose. No complaints on tonights meal.  I ordered the antipasta salad, a little different than some, but still good. Very large portion, with rolled up meat and cheese, pepperchinis, tomato, red onion and ripe olives. Use to marinated vegetables on an antipasta, but none were to be found. Was a nice green salad.  My husband had lasagna, again a large portion, took a bite and it had great flavor! With the large portions we ended up taking some of it home.  Good meal, nearby."}
{"text":"Super good food!!!!!!! Garlic balls and chicken Parmesan sandwich were so amazing!!! For sure will order again!!!!! :)"}
{"text":"Wow, I'm sooo disappointed in their food, it forced me to write about them.  Greasy, extremely untimely, horrible food.  NEVER AGAIN. Here we were at home, and I asked my bf to get something other than his usual from another restaurant.  We decided to order from this pizzeria because it was somewhere we haven't tried before.  We asked for delivery, and the lady was very nice over the phone.  Then we waited for well over an hour.  They finally contacted us an hour and a half later and were very apologetic.  That was nice of them to call, but as 2 hours rolled by we finally got our food....yay.  Except for the fact that my bf's poor sandwich looked fit for a malnourished boy...where was all the meat?  That's all he asked for on his sandwich, yet they couldn't give him more than a morsel's size worth?  His fries were greasy and soggy, okay it happens.  My fried pickles looked like they sat in a grease tub soaking all night lonng.  They were dripping with oil and very mushy.  Oil just oozed out when I poked at it.  This will be my last experience from here, but I feel terrible for convincing my bf to try this place, when he knew of a very good pizzeria himself.  The moral of our story is stick with what you know is good, and if it ain't broke, don't fix it.  SORRY Honey."}
{"text":"Ordered two 24\" pizzas (3 hours in advance!) two nights ago.  $70 including tip and delivery.  Live only a few minutes away from this location.  One pizza was good, the other was ice cold and way under cooked.  The diced green pepper was cold and hard, and the entire pizza was so soggy that it fell apart in to a wet cold blob.  Very unappetizing."}
{"text":"Will never order from this place again. The cheese on the pizza was spongy with a strange tang, but otherwise had very little flavor. The garlic knots tasted like bland dough."}
{"text":"I do not recommend this place! Walked In and sat down and was sitting for 10 min before we were greeted and then we ordered drinks and the cups were given to us dripping wet with soda running off the sides of the cup! Then she came back 20 min later to take our food order! When I looked over to see what they were doing they were watching some videos on there IPad! While all three of our drinks were empty!        Food was also not very good at all! Really.....how can u screw up chicken fingers and fry ?? Then we were ready to pay and no bill was brought to me because they were outside smoking cigarettes! So I went up and waited at the counter for them to see me up there and come inside! But wait there's more...they went back to work after smoking and didn't was there hands! Here is a couple pics I took of them watching videos and my empty drink!"}
{"text":"I ordered online around 1120 pm food didn't arrive till 110 am. I am pregnant and pist Deffently won't order from here again bacon on my burger is slimy not happy at all. Plus I ordered threw grub hub and then they told be my total was 34$ all of a sudden I'm. Being charged 40$"}
{"text":"I would say it's one of the best non-franchise pizza places out there. A 3Star rating because of the way my order was billed. I called and asked for a pizza special. Ordered 2 pizzas along with a Philly and 10 hot wings. Immediately I called back because I realized it was too much food for just 2 people; plus it totaled $49! So I asked for a \"special\" that included hot wings along with a pizza hoping to save some money. To my surprise, upon delivery I realized the girl had billed all items a la carte. My total was $43! A bit more than I expected to pay, all because nothing was combined into a \"deal\" price! Delivery was 1:10 mins. But she did quote accurately so that was ok. Will probably order again; I will just make sure this time if don't over pay!"}
{"text":"Quick, easy & all Vegas! We recently had our monthly lunchtime team meeting here at this nearby location. The restaurant is also open 24hrs, has all the amenities you'd expect here in Las Vegas, as well as fast servings of classic Italian food. Delivery is also an option, so they've got you covered there too with their multiple locations throughout the area. Thanks, Angelina's!"}
{"text":"Ordered pizza, French fries, honey bbq chicken wings and a side salad. Everything was amazing! Definitely a must if you're hungry and can't forget the woman on the phone who took our order even helped us find the perfect combo."}
{"text":"I just moved to Seven Hills and tried Angelina's pizza for the first time with my brother while he was in town and we enjoyed it a lot! The servings are huge, the prices are good, but the wait is long and the sauce on the spaghetti is a little bland. Would definitely order the pizza again though!"}
{"text":"Order arrived within stated 1 hr timeframe. Pizza was warm,  not hot. Tasted good though.  We read other people saying they didn't get sour cream with their potato skins so we specifically asked for it. Didn't receive it.  If it weren't for those problems, this place would probably be our pizza go-to."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a new pizza place and I think I have found my new spot.  I was desperate for pizza in the way that only a pregnant woman can be and after Slice let me down and Antonio's was just awful, I knew I had to search out something new.  Angelina's had good reviews and was close, so it was worth a shot.   I ordered a large with pineapple and bacon.  Wow.  Real cheese - I think provolone for the bite with a lot of canned pineapple and the piece de resistance - real, crunchy bacon broked into smaller pieces!  No bacon bits here.  It was awesome.  The sauce isn't too sweet or too spicy, the crust is just spongey enough, but not too chewy.  While I do still love me some thin crust, this pizza will do.  I can't wait to order again and try something on their large, large menu."}
{"text":"The wings are good, and I have to admit that the chicken tenders are one of my favorites. I thought it was odd that they asked what flavor we wanted the tenders, but they are juicy and as hot as I want them to be, and thats hot as in wing sauce. The pizza is good as well, but the smaller the pizza size, the better the taste. The cheese on the pizza was nice and hot and melted evenly, and the deals are what really helped me choose what to order."}
{"text":"I have Ordered Angelinas over the last three years a couple times to go and obviously a lot to eat in considering I work right next to them. Every single time they never cease to amaze me with a horrible delivery time and cold frozen prepackaged food the mozzarella sticks orache string G and hot in multi. They are literally just a cold brick of mozzarella with breading. The pasta shells want that bad but they were drowning in way too much sauce. Garlic bread sucks and the salad is nothing to be desired.  I kept wondering to give the multiple chances and frankly I only ordered out of sheer desperation. And every time it's horrible.  On the other hand there is a lady who works there who's from either England or Australia and she's very sweet and always friendly. The chocolate cake that I ordered last night was supposed to come all a mode which they said they had. When I received my store-bought chocolate cake which tasted absolutely horrible it had no ice cream. The excuse I got when I called was \"oh I didn't know what à la mode meant.\" Again even though the staff to answer the phone was finally there seems to be a huge disconnect with restaurant customer service. Most of the reviews that I put on Yelp are positive but unfortunately this one gets nothing more than two stars.    My recommendations for Angelinas is pretty simple:  Invest in quality food number one number two actually put the quality food to a decent temperature and number three stop buying store-bought desserts and get a chef who can actually make some desserts on their own.  Don't call yourself a restaurant when you're nothing more than a cheap café with horrible diner food."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how Dominos or Little Caesar's crappy pizza hasn't put this dump out of business. I had a customer take me here, so we showed up and there's a buzzer that you have to press to get in at night (a sure sign it's a high-class place) and you walk in to the scent of stale cigarette smoke. The waitstaff spent more time talking to each other & moving at the speed-of-I-don't-give-a-damn than getting customers orders. Finally it took us 45 minutes to get the semi-descent Pizza but not any better than Dominos or whatever other crappy pizza chain place. About the only bright spot is the bar where the bar tender was attentive and bothered to pay attention to what's going on. There has to be better places here in Vegas to eat."}
{"text":"The pizzas here are suprisingly good! I get the pepperoni since I'm a huge fan of it. I've been to several locations and they have all turned out to be terrific. I've heard the wings are bomb as well. My girl gets the salds, which are huge!  You can call ahead and they are good about it being ready on time."}
{"text":"Just ordered a large meat lovers pizza OMG sooooooo Bombbbbbbbbbbb!!!! As a pizza lover I appreciate  the put the special love an care on a DELIVERY!!!!! HOT !  CHEESY ! FRESH. ! & DELICIOUS ! I also got hot wings and requested extra spicy they made me a custom spicy sauce an added extra ranch on the side!!! I'm a Vegas local an will Definitely order again. THANK YOU ANGELINAS MAkINg My MOVIe NiGht A SuCESS!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Today was our 10 yr anniversary and we just wanted to order delivery and stay home.  There was a problem with getting our order delivered to the house.   The manager Cheri went way above and beyond to make it right.  She didn't have to,  but she did and it absolutely made our day.   Beyond \"great\" customer service.  Absolutely outstanding and the food as always is amazing."}
{"text":"I just ate at ANGELINAS ,  not only was the food excellent , my waiter's Phillip and Michael were amazing with customer service and attentiveness ! Great service , great food !!"}
{"text":"Placed an order for pick up at 6:30pm. I was told food would be ready in 20-25 minutes. I get there at 7 and food was not ready until 7:30pm! On top of that my food was cold and overcooked as the chicken wings and garlic bread were burnt! If it takes longer, then say so! And if it does take that long, make sure it taste good and warm!  How are you \"Best of LV\"? Definitely not this location!"}
{"text":"I don't usually offer delivery but when I do it's Angelina. I see a lot of negative reviews and honestly Idk if I'm lucky but it's always great. Best late night delivery I've ever had. Food is always hot and they arrive earlier than estimated"}
{"text":"We came in and we're greeted by everyone. They recognized my coworker and she was very pleasant and the atmosphere was a nice breakaway from work. It's nice to have a good lunch spot close to work that you enjoy."}
{"text":"Pizza is always delicious every time I come. I know where to go for pizza in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Pizza was terrible! Came burnt, which was clearly visible and they still delivered it.  Crust was hard as a rock, too bad, was hoping to find a good pizza place in the area we just moved into!"}
{"text":"We used to come here late at night after work and we'd order pizza and have a couple of beers. It was amazingly good 2-3 months back but today we ordered the same topping since and it just tasted bland! It wasn't the topping. The sauce may to have seem bland. It used to be great. We just hope it'll be better next time."}
{"text":"Food is not that good and the customer service is horrible. Services are very poor and the staff is rude and unprofessional. I would not recommend, to many other good places around for them to treat customers the way they do. If I was the owner I would fire the staff including the daughter that claims to be the manager and start training a new staff, hopefully you would get better results"}
{"text":"Seriously....  this has to be about the 4th or 5th time I have ordered food from here to go and it has been half assed!  Seriously, how hard is it to fuck up an order of wings and fries!?!?!!!! Well if you ever want to know, just go to this location!  The only reason I stop by this location today was to order food... upon delivery I was shorted my (automatically to come with) ranch sides... had to ask for it. Get home, to find that I was charged for more than I asked for and shorted what I asked for.  Drive back there (Of course I'm annoyed)  asked them to fix my order or give my $$ back..   u get in response... \"what do you want?\"  Obviously I want you to fi, it but with that attitude, just give me my $$ back. ....  then the twit handling it tells me, \"just don't order here anymore\"  (she forgets she fucked up myblast order) Wow....  best customer service I have received from them ever!!!   Stilliana has got to be the worst kitchen mgr's i have crossed paths with in this establishment!  And I have been a valiant consumer for several years. Seriously, what kind of mgmt  come around a  corner to take an order and says.... \"fuck, it's (so and so)\" Way to go again Angelina's.... EPIC CUSTOMER SERVICE, ONCE AGAIN!!!!  THANK YOU!"}
{"text":"I won't even write a long review like I want to.  There's too much to put.  Let's just say it was Horrible food was tasteless.  Delivery guy had THE WORST ATTITUDE.  waited 2 hours for B. S.  And paid $30 DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME."}
{"text":"Huge portions for the price. Friendly staff. Garlic balls are the bomb!! Would definately recommend this place to everyone. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Located within the O'Aces bar behind the hospital. We've been there once for sit-down and once for pick-up. The bar atmosphere is nice, but the restaurant area is way too big for their location and service staff. Waitress forgot some of our order and we didn't get our appetizers. However, for the price, its not too bad but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Very pleasantly surprised. New to the area. Tried several menu items. The pizza crust is awesome and their delivery was fast! We are definitely ordering from them again.  On 8/18/2015 I changed my rating of Angelina's from 5 to 3 stars. We ordered delivery again and this time it took and hour and 45 minutes. We called after an hour and they said it was on its way. Well, 45 minutes later our order arrived. I would eat here again, but not ordering delivery. We are about 10 minutes away."}
{"text":"Slow service...mediocre pizza and the worst wings EVER!  We ordered for an office lunch, and were very disappointed.  Phoned in complaint and the 12 year old who answered phone,  placed us on hold three times.  They argued with us about the quality of the food.  No more for us."}
{"text":"Pizza was fair at best. I ordered a Philly cheese steak pizza and it had zero taste to it. There wasn't much meat on it either. The pepperoni pie was okay. There are a lot of other pizza places to eat with better pizza, so I'd change my recipe and use better ingredients"}
{"text":"Unbelievable food. Great prices. I get delivery or pick up on a weekly basis. One of the best hamburgers I've had ever!"}
{"text":"Ordered 3 chicken fingers and fries from Angelina's Pizzeria today. The restaurant took over 45 minutes to make 3 mediocre chicken fingers and one order of old, rubbery fries. Really sad and disappointing experience. Giving this place 0.009 stars, if possible."}
{"text":"I have had this pizza and much other food at this location my family and I love it .... Such great customer service .. A hard working great family owned pizzeria.. The pizza is always fresh and hot ..The staff is very helpful. We get the wings the ranch is to die for( HOMEMADE) ....GREAT salads I cant say enough about this place..... Keep it up !!!! will be back over and over ..."}
{"text":"I have been to this location several times they never let me down the service is outstanding not just one particular waitstaff all of them that we have had between them and angelinas outstanding pizza (not to mention there philly yum yum )it is a great place to go to get great service and great quality food.we got delivery tonight to late to go anywhere and just as pleased to much food once again angelinas thanks we r stuffed..    Ps I left out the driver was so nice he even brought us paper plates ...."}
{"text":"One of my top go to places for lunch during the work week. Always get the Mexican chicken philly as a wrap, very good food. Otherwise it's just as good as any other typical bar."}
{"text":"Where to begin...? Perhaps the sad customer service when I called about the problem with the delivery order? The food itself? Maybe the delivery guy who 3x started putting the food on the ground even after I said \"NO!!! The exterminator sprayed right THERE today with strong poison!!!\" ? But I'll start with the food. I ordered a calzone. Literally did not know it was possible for anyone, anywhere to make such a completely abhorrent calzone. Angelina's may have deep-fried it---I'm not kidding. Deep-fried.  A calzone! If not, somehow it got literally **slathered** in grease. And on top of that? Covered with Salt salt salt and....more salt---with maybe some pamesan cheese? So nauseatingly salty and oily I had to take a dishtowel and blot the calzone--attempting to brush the substance off the top of it. This next thing---you're not even going to believe it----jawdropping. I'd ordered ground beef and zucchini. The ground beef tasted like.....yup....salt.  Harvested from, like, 1/4 of 1 mooshed up school cafeteria hamburger. That's not the bad part. The ZUCCHINI was FRIED!!! Yes, inside the calzone. Big monking hunks of dripping foul-tasting greasy globs of fried batter---at first I thought they shoved home fries into my calzone!  These blobs of 3/4 greasy batter and 1/4 tiny specs of zucchini! I tried to remove them and the cheese stuck to the batter, so when the grotesque grease/batter lumps were pulled out, the cheese came out too.  I was starving---and it was supposed to be a treat to order out. Threw half of it away. My stomach is upset now.  It also seems like the was MSG in the food--I'm allergic and having symptoms----MSG is a calzone?!!! The only thing I can figure is they made this monstrosity in honor of Halloween  (ha ha)....1 Star from good tiramsu.  ps - I called the restaurant to talk to the manager prior to writing a Yelp review. The woman answering the phone was so concerned with her own ability to find my exact order, and inability to do so, asking question after question, she would not even allow me to explain to her what was wrong.  Impatient: \"maaayum, I am TRYIN' a find yor ORDARR!\" Nor would she connect me to the manager.  Her preoccupation with her process was far more important than talking to a human being/customer. After sitting with her while she flailed and scolded me for trying simply to say generally what I was calling for--I did something I never do: I hung up. I did call back and ask what was up with finding gobs of fried dough in the calzone and the manager indicated they do NOT put zucchini in the calzones----they put their FROZEN FRIED ZUCCHINI appetizer in it. Absolutely disgusting."}
{"text":"I had the speghatti and meatballs and it was so good! It came with garlic bread and a salad and for a great price too. I ordered to go and I'm always a little weary of taking things home because it never tastes as good as when you eat it there but dang it was so good so I can't even imagine what it tastes like fresh out! Will be coming back to try!"}
{"text":"I don't understand how all the Yelpers before me had such a terrible experience with this place. We got the recommendation from our cab driver and were so hungry that we called the minute we got back to the hotel (without checking Yelp first). We ordered a large pizza, which is HUGE, and the garlic balls because the employee told us they were very popular. It was $26 for everything.  They told us the delivery time would be in 30 minutes to an hour, and it came in about 45. The delivery guy called our cell phone when he got to the hotel so we could come down and meet him. While we were waiting for the delivery I decided to check it out on Yelp and what I saw genuinely frightened me. I was very apprehensive of what the food would be like.  We rushed back up to the room with out piping hot pizza and opened the box. It was beautiful! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/21sGRVR7HEs_t6PdB9tGMw?select=LQMPy6vv62SNXlSAjl5TyQ There was absolutely nothing wrong with it, appearance or taste-wise. I would order again from Angelina's in a heartbeat. The pizza was humongous, I could only eat a slice and a half and I usually eat 3. The sauce was good, the cheese was ooey gooey, and the pepperoni was delish.   Now let me just tell you about the garlic balls. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/21sGRVR7HEs_t6PdB9tGMw?select=aP_WJK7y4n2qhwT-f6ygHw I'm talkin' about the AMAZING balls of fried dough covered in cheese and garlic. The order came with about 30. I could not eat these things fast enough. They were hot, melt-in-your-mouth deliciousness and I'm ashamed to remember how many I ate.   Bottom line: Give this place a shot because I LOVED it. Not a single complaint. If I lived in Vegas, this would be my regular pizza spot."}
{"text":"We've been ordering from Angelina's for years.  I would say we order at least once every three weeks if not more often.  We've tried different items on the menu and the food has always been delicious.  We normally order and pick up.  We had an issue on a delivery where we were double billed about a year ago and didn't order for a period of time but gave them another shot after 6 months. After last night's fiasco we are done and it's shame as we like to support local small businesses especially when they are so yummy.  Placed a to-go order for pick up.  Was told at the time of ordering 30-35 mins before ready.  When I arrived and paid (ahead of time and included a tip) I was told it would be a couple of minutes.  After a little wait another server told me he was checking on the food.  Soon he comes out and apologizes that the chef never received my order and he was just starting on the order.  This is at least 40 minutes after my initial call.  I am told it will be at least 20 mins and offers me a free dessert or free drink.  Ummm, how about comping the meal??  I continue to wait.  Finally the order comes out and it's almost 1hr 30mins since the initial call.  To make matters even worse, upon arriving home and getting the food out to eat we did not receive the salads that come along with our dinners nor the garlic bread that also accompanies the dinners.  Very, very disappointing."}
{"text":"24 inch pizza! God dang! Well worth the price of 28.99 because it fed 5 people, but could have easily fed about 7!   The pizza was good. I like my pizza crispy so I was disappointed when just the edges were crispy and the middle was soggy!! Boo. The sausages were quite tasty and I wanted to pick them off.. but I resisted the urge. :o/  Make sure to try the zeppolis. A dessert that reminds me a bit of beignets.. What lacked in crispiness from my pizza went to these little bad boys. They came out crispy on the outside (should have been a bit softer) but soft on the inside. ASK FOR EXTRA RASPBERRY SAUCE FOR DIPPING. (Cherry, not so good. Caramel, eh.. Raspberry HELL YEAH!)  Our server was super nice. I believe her name was Natasha. She made sure to keep a smile on her face and made sure that we were attended to.  Overall, a nice experience. :o)"}
{"text":"To get 5 stars from me is hard. For 5 stars you need to meet: great atmosphere, great staff, great music, great food, cleanliness, and the place must \"flow.\"   The food is good for the price you pay for. But just to order a club sandwich and fried mushrooms took 25 mins to come out. They gave a free side of ranch & bottle of water because it took so long. Need to call in if you want to make it quick. Other wise you'll always wait to get your food."}
{"text":"Starving, ordered pizza and entered Angelinas with the charisma of a zombie food diva, my dark cloud of hunger negativity had zero affect on the short pacific islander girl working behind the counter. Paid and in my delusion left my debit card at the desk. Upon returning to my chair I retreated mentally to a happy place filled with danishes, cream cheese and rainbow sprinkles trying to forget my hunger. My delusion was then interrupted by the same girl dangling my debit card in my face, \"Here you are......Silly rabbit\". Cuter words never spoken, I had almost completely forgotten the stabbing pain in my stomach and I can't tell if it was love or low blood sugar but when I stood up to grab my pizza from her I nearly fainted."}
{"text":"Should have known not to order from this place with the negative reviews.  I ordered at 11:15 am today thorugh Yelp Eat24.  1:00 pm comes and still no food.  I will NEVER EVER order from this place again!"}
{"text":"Love the customer service when we come in... My grand kids love Natasha   They call her Angelina Jole.  The other waitress is a sweetheart as well.. I love how if you come in a bad mood, your mood changes because of this wonderful crew.  We love the pizza and the salads.. I had a BLT today is it was great!!  We end up going at least 2 times a weak because my grandkids love the treatment from your staff.  We are loyal customers for more than one reason... Customer Service sells me.."}
{"text":"Its the little things that keep a customer from coming back! Ordered $26.00 worth of carry-out, Asked for a cup of ICE, Her reply was I'll have to charge you for that!   WHAT  \"Go out of Business\" and I still tipped her $2.00 anyway. This is why"}
{"text":"I'm only giving 2 stars because I just ordered and was charged a $5.00 DELIVERY CHARGE PLUS a $1.00 fee for using a credit card. Not to mention, the drivers tip. I don't live that far away! The pizza is decent, not the best I've ever had, but I can get decent pizza delivered for a lot cheaper from other places. I'll  only order from this place again if they stop charging outrageous fees!"}
{"text":"Third pizza delivery I've tried since moving to Nevada and my new favorite! Delivery was much faster than promised, they'll deliver late into the night, and the pizza was hot, fresh and delicious. I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Great food not just the pizza. Prices are ok for the amount of food u get and always Is delicious. Mmmmm!!! One thing though I do wish they had avacado for there sandwiches . Delivery was fast sometimes or at least on time better than most. They communicate well and they read preparation instructions careful which means they actually get your order right yay."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. Ordered carry out at 1am. Phone service was excellent and she was patient with me while we went over menu items and specials. I got a 14\" pep and mushroom pizza well done... It was ready in 25 minutes. Crust crispy on outside and soft on the inside. Good quality cheese and toppings. Sauce had nice zest."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good...service not so much. I can understand service being \"off\" when it's busy but NOT when there's nobody in the joint but you and one other guy waiting on his order.  Smile, ladies...You're employed..."}
{"text":"Best pizzeria in Brookline, hands down. Friendly service and always prompt delivery. Great menu selection too."}
{"text":"Staff plays games with pricing. Internet ad cites take-out specials for an entire pizza, but staff told me they know nothing about such specials. And they have the gall to stiff me for one slice. No thanks. I like honest merchants, who abide with their ads, their representations, and their product. Full of internet-special gimmicks. AVOID. DO NOT BE MADE INTO A FOOL."}
{"text":"I placed an order for pick up, and they said 15 minutes, and they were right my food was ready. Unfortunately it wasn't what I ordered. I took a look at it and verified what I had ordered was not what was in the to go box. The cashier then let me know they have two sandwiches with the same name, and apologized no offer to remake my order nothing. So I left, but turned around and said that since that was not what I ordered I wanted a new sandwich. Of which they complied, but of course not with out the original cashier being rude and less than helpful. My first and last time eating from this place.  *update* I have a friend who lives down the road from here and brought some food over from this location. It was delicious and opened me up to going over to try them out again. I have been pleasantly surprised. The service has been consistently great and the food has been superb. Good job, guys!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and i thought The Pizza was amazing , an let me tell you, he happens to be from Brooklyn and hes extremely hard to please. Yet he loved it.  We also ordered garlic balls , which were to die for ..  the service was very personable and while i waited for my quick take out i was able to play galaga at the bar and and have a cold beer.  I ll definatly order from them again."}
{"text":"Good food but horrible service. The messed up my order twice. I made an order online and went to go pick it up and they gave me the wrong order. Of course I didn't realize this until I got home but when I called them to let them know, I didn't even get so much as an apology. I asked if they could just have my food delivered since THEY are the ones who gave me the wrong order and I was told I had to drive back to get my food. When I went back, the lady just handed me my food and didn't say anything, she just walked away. The food I did order also had things missing from it but I was tired of waiting to speak with someone. I understand that they may be busy or short staffed but I don't understand the bad customer service."}
{"text":"They took almost two hours to deliver my food and when it got here it was cold as ice and looked like dog food. When I called to complain the manager was very rude and told me food is supposed to be cold when you order delivery. I only ordered a philly,fries,and a drink and the total was almost 28 dollars and had high expectations for the price but the food is not worth the prices!The food is over priced!Terrible customer service!!! I'm guessing since this location is inside of a bar, only people with alcohol in their system would think the food is edible. Don't order from this location!"}
{"text":"This place is totally underrated. Yeah the pizza is Devine, but try the bbq chicken some time with corn bread. Or the chicken wings, on the bone, sauce on the side. I love Angelina's! Also they are open late too :)"}
{"text":"Best pizza and service in Las Vegas. I visit here about once a week and I always ask for Alisha. She always makes me feel welcome and gives great service."}
{"text":"horrible service!!   cold pizza and unfriendly deliverer. owner of the restaurant was rude and didnt care to please the customer or the cold pizza!! not worth the money! we will continue to tell everyone!!"}
{"text":"The worst service area. Put such a bad taste in my mouth, I didn't get a chance to taste the food."}
{"text":"I am not the type to typically write reviews good or bad, but I thought my experience was worth sharing...  I ordered pizza and chicken fingers for delivery. After waiting forty-five minutes to an hour the pizza delivery guy showed up with the pizza, but without the chicken fingers. I called back and they agreed to redeliver the chicken fingers. Half an hour or so later the delivery guy returns with the order. Once we opened the order in hope of finally enjoying our dinner, we find out that the order contained chicken wings instead of chicken fingers. Starving at this time my wife tries a couple chicken wings, while I get on the phone for the third time. After explaining that the order did not contain chicken fingers but wings, they agree to redeliver the chicken fingers. However, shortly after I receive a call back indicating that they will need the wings back, I indicate that my wife ate a couple of wings but we would be able happy to return the remaining wings. The lady then indicates that since we ate a couple of wings that they would not be able to redeliver unless we wished to pay for the chicken fingers. Not willing to get into an argument at this point I simply hang up.  I am not sure if these guys know what service is all about, but this is basic restaurant 101 \"you don't make the client pay for the same item twice\". I would not order from here again especially since the food was average at best.  There are many other choices for the price, buyer beware..."}
{"text":"I went into Angelina's Pizza & Returaunt, for the second time , there food is delicious however there customer service is horrible. From the minute that I walked in the door there was no acknowledgement or welcoming, front the  counter females they lack in customer service and are abrupt unprofessional. Smoking right out front of your business is such a turn off. These are not the people that I want handling my food. Just a word of advice To the owner of the company you should train your staff or hire people whom are qualified to run your business. You have outstanding food but your employees are not great !!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a hamburger, recieved an entirely different order after almost two hours of waiting. Delivery person walked away before counting the cash I handed him. Not at all impressed. Unprofessional and incompetent  to say the least."}
{"text":"I frequently visit this place during lunchtime and I love it, they have great lunch specials.  Initially came by because it was close to my office, really admire the service and the food is great. I usually get a personal pizza and wings, but other stuff I've had that's great is the chicken Alfredo, nachos, and the bacon burger. All great. Really chill atmosphere too. It's a great place to come by during lunch at work to have a good lunch and get away from the office. Haven't used the bar here since I come for lunch, but it seems like good vibes too."}
{"text":"Bomb.com! I can never go wrong with Angelina's . Conveniently located and the food is always yummy! There's something about the cheese that I can't get enough of. It's stringy and reminds me of those slices in a cartoon! Cartoon pizza is always a yes! Try them out you won't be dissapointed..I see a lot of delivery issues on here, but we've never had a problem and I can literally say we've order about 10-20x from here.   Stromboli is super yummy but my fave is the original pep pizza. Sometimes we'll spice it up with some black olives and jalapeños .. :) oh their chicken wings and fingers are pretty yum also!"}
{"text":"Lunch hour for me starts at 11 so I'm pretty lucky to beat the lunch crowd.   I knew I wanted eggplant parmigiana for lunch the other day so I stopped at this neighborhood establishment.   Walking in, the restaurant is large but not many tables were setup. It was dark and felt empty. No hostess booth either. There was a staff member behind the bar at the cash register. Which was a little confusing for me. I was summoned to pick a table so I choose one nearest the door for the natural lighting.  Of course, the table I would chose had parmesan cheese sprinkled all over it.  Because it was only 11am, I wondered how long the table was left that way. In anycase, the waitress was quick to dust it off for me.  I was hungry and I knew it would take a little longer for the food to come out, so I went ahead and ordered. I was super pleased with my meal. My dish was rather large and had 3 slices of eggplant. I had it for lunch for two more days thereafter. Super tasty.   Upon leaving, I asked the waitress if I could have a to go cup for my coke. She ended up coming back to the table with a full up.  Super sweet. And because of the amount of food I had left, she even packed up my meal to go.  Atmosphere could use a lot of work, great food and customer service giving this neighbor 4-stars."}
{"text":"Ordered four cheeseburgers for me and my friends at 12am. ( we had all been drinking and it wasn't safe to drive for food)  The food came in a timely manner. The burgers were decent.  It got the job done and we were all pretty happy with our order."}
{"text":"If you're from NYC do not get this pizza. Wasn't nice and cheesy like NYC. We were hungry and it satisfied us along with the antipasto salad which was overloaded with meats. That I will not complain about it was so full of meat it was almost in appetizing LOLOL but they don't have food pizza. At least the cheese wasn't"}
{"text":"This place thinks outside of the box, and I respect that.  Everything about this place is different than the normal everyday pizza place.  With offerings like reuben hoagies and beef stroganoff, it might not be what you're into, but hey, atleast they have the balls to offer it to you.  Personally, this is my All-Time favorite place to order sandwiches.  Pizza is exceptional, but their hoagies are top notch."}
{"text":"Never ordering from them again! I have been a loyal customer of theirs for 2 years now, their ranch was love at first bite! I always get their pizza & garlic knots combo & sub the marinara for ranch ALWAYS! Well the last time I did the exact same thing for a work function saw what I thought was ranch wrapped in foil only to open it & it was marinara sauce. I understand we all make mistakes so I call & let them know that I didn't get the ranch like I requested. The lady on the phone said well you ordered this & this so where in there are supposed to get ranch cause neither one of them come with it. I told her I requested to sub the marinara instead the only reason I order from Angelina's is their RANCH! She then told me id have to wait 30 mins, for freaking ranch are you kidding me?! So I did and guess what they never showed sat around starving having my pizza get cold for nothing! So I'll take my business elsewhere to somewhere that appreciate their customers."}
{"text":"When I crave that truly authentic New York style pizza, I go to Angelinas's pizzeria. They have delicious sandwiches, awesome pizza, and a great staff."}
{"text":"So, after a LONG morning with work, I decided I was going to buy my Crew and I lunch. We decided for Angelina's being that we/the Crew orders from there frequently. Well, for me, this stops today. After placing the phone order on our way back to our Shop, the location mind you is less than a mile or two from our Shop, problem number 1 happened, it took them over an hour to get our delivery delivered. I even had to call to follow up with the order. Then problem #2, my Credit Card. My CC doesn't have raised numbers like traditional cards do, it's flat. We told them over the phone that this was the case. Once the delivery driver showed up, he had to call in to confirm on how to process my CC; see they still need to imprint the CC like if it was 1982, who does this still?? Oh, THEY do! I called & spoke with a female manager and I asked if they were adamant on not taking my card because of no embossed numbers ans she very nonchalantly said correct, we will not. Then I said, then you need to refund me my charge. She, once again very nonchalantly & very perky, ok, no problem.  So, I'm starving and the good deed I wanted to do for my Crew got shut down! Again, really embossing CC numbers? That's like an ancient Chinese secret. Get with it Angelina's! Oh and I BETTER get my refund too!"}
{"text":"Our new favorite pizza place. The food is great and so is the service. We live pretty close so we haven't dealt with any delivery issues because we get it ourselves. A nice place to have a relaxing lunch."}
{"text":"Came it strictly for the wings. Great sauce on the medium and hot Wong's and fingers. Our party of three ordered Moscow mules, calamari and chips and Queso dip along with the chicken finger and wings combo. Great flavors and perfect during our lunch and pregame festivities."}
{"text":"The customer service at this location is HORRIBLE. One of the employees, Cybal, was EXTREMELY RUDE. They sent us the WRONG pizza, which took an hour to deliver. They promised me they would fix and deliver the correct pizza right away. I called several times and was continuously put on hold or hung up on. I finally received a BURNT pizza, two hours later. Please don't go to this location. They're employees are so rude, and they have no costumer service skills."}
{"text":"Really good pizza at a very good price. Have ordered \"take out\" many times and never disappointed. You can't beat the take out specials!"}
{"text":"Good food, but I ordered delivery to my hotel- a large pizza and potato skins with sour cream and got zero paper plates and only three thin napkins."}
{"text":"Pretty solid place for lunch and pizza.  They have a pretty solid lunch menu and specials.  You can eat lunch for about $8.  I hit this place maybe once every two weeks or so.  Pretty quick service, they have delivery as well."}
{"text":"Great pizza and great service. Even though it was late I'm glad I didn't settle for Pizza Hut or Dominos. Definitely coming back to try more."}
{"text":"I'm always a bit wary about places like this that put a flyer in my door, but I had a coupon from a delivery service that helped me get a good deal and I ordered some delivery.  I got cheese fries, garlic balls, and a pepperoni & sausage pizza.    The cheese fries were nothing special.  I saw a pic on yelp where the cheese sauce came on the side, but when I got them the cheese was all over the top -- some Cheez Wiz type of concoction.  They weren't bad but they weren't great and I ended up throwing most of them out.  The garlic balls were amazing and just as good reheated the next day.  They come with a marinara sauce that's top notch as well.  I'm not sure if they're better with or without the sauce.  I wasn't expecting much from the pizza but it was actually very good.  The crust was great, a good amount of cheese, and the pepperoni and sausage were flavorful.  I will definitely be ordering from here again!"}
{"text":"I give this place a 3 Star \"Good\" across the board. The food is good - we had cannelloni and ravioli as meals. The jalapeño poppers were tasty. The Tiramisu was disappointing. The pizza is good, not great.   Prefer take-out to eating in as the place has too much of a fast food feel to it..."}
{"text":"Well...I don't know about their pizza but their Greek Salad was great! I'm kinda lazy when it comes about food, so I put my tomatoes on the side, they were to big for me...LOL  Friendly stuff, checked on us few times...but what's the to check, I'm just too lazy to cu my own tomatoes...not that I don't like them :)"}
{"text":"I tried to give them another chance and didn't use grub hub ( who they blamed before)  They cannot seem to get an order correct.   Did not get half of my order.  When I called,  \"It's 100% our fault. Do you want to come get it?\"   When I said no and explained I had driven home, she got an attitude with me.  Told me how she couldn't leave the store to drive it to me, which was never asked of her.  Clearly they screw up orders regularly and feel the need to treat customers like crap.  All I was looking for was a credit, now I doubt I'll use it...seems like the type of place where they would spit in your food.  When I asked for the credit, she wasn't even asking for my information until I asked for her name and told her I didn't believe I would get a credit.  I would love to talk to a manager or owner."}
{"text":"I have ordered delivery several times, delivery is prompt, food is still hot and fresh upon arriving. Decided to dine in tonight, Natasha was the server; she was super nice and provided awesome service. Prices are great food quantity and quality is excellent!"}
{"text":"I ordered their 18\" Cheese Pizza special ($9.99) and added sausage ($2.00), the pizza was great. I ordered 8 Honey BBQ wings and the sauce was good and wings were covered completely just the way I like it. I do recommend them and I will order from them again. I did carry out so the pizza was nice and hot when I got back to work."}
{"text":"After reading bad reviews I decided to give this place the benefit of the doubt. I can now understand many people's concerns, this place isn't in business for the customer at all.   The staff or owners are always rude and pressing when you order on the phone and at times have been argumentative. Ive ordered roughly 5 times from them considering its the closes pizza place to me. Ive never had a hot pizza delivered,  its always been warm. The pricing is inconsistent, sometimes I'm charged a delivery charge sometimes Im not. When I questioned this issue I figured since most of my pizzas had been delivered without a delivery fee and this is what I was use to she would at least waive the fee as usual in my order history, but she wouldn't. A delivery driver delivered my pizza with his music blasting in my apartment complex one time, I noticed it was his car when I opened the door. Ive always tipped very generously, but when you are paying $25-$40 for pizza and sides, your pizza should be delivered HOT especially since I'm literally 3 mins away from them. I wont be ordering anymore I found another New York pizza place:)"}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza & chicken fingers for delivery. They didn't bring the ranch for the fingers. But besides that, both my husband & I did not like it at all, in fact we tossed it."}
{"text":"So I've ordered from here a few times and I must say i have never been disappointed with any of the items Ive tried from here.  Ive tried several different items from there huge menu the funny part is Ive never tried there pizza but here are a few items I have tried...  The 1st thing I ever was the Fettuccine Alfredo it was generous portions of saucy creamy goodness I was surprised at how tasty it was being that most pizza places don't have the best tasting pastas.  Next time I ordered from here I tried the wings i got half Garlic Parmesan and half Hot wings bone in and they were very tasty and delicious, not to mention I must say they have the best ranch dressing Ive ever had in my life so i really enjoyed dipping these tasty critters into there wonderful ranch dressing.   next time i tried the Spicy Crispy Chicken Sandwich which was very yummy how can you go wrong with a good quality chicken patty hot sauce and mayo hmm hmm good.  Last but probably my favorite item Ive tried at this place was their Philly Cheese steak OMG juicy, flavorful, cheesy goodness this by far is one of the best cheese steaks Ive ever had I could of sucked down 2 of these tasty things my mouth is watering just writing about it. This is definitely a must try if you go to this place.  I absolutely love this place Ive never found a place where everything Ive tried on the menu is truly delicious and i must say they are reasonably priced. The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because when I order from here I do delivery and it takes about an hour for me to get my food, other then that there is no going wrong with Angelina's."}
{"text":"Phillip helped a lot! Love coming here for pizza and wings. Great little place. One of the best pizzas in Vegas hands down."}
{"text":"Two stars because I really do enjoy their food. It's convenient to have it delivered to my office as well. But the customer service side of it is surely lacking. I want to love this place as I have been going there for very long but it's getting harder and harder. Wait times on delivery are excessive and not quoted properly. Previously, I ordered for my office and after waiting almost two hours everything was delivered cold and two dishes were left out completely. And just today I waited over an hour to find an extremely long hair running through out my wrap. Needless to say the over hour wait was not worth it because I cannot eat it now. Wear hair nets! Medium length hair should be tied up and no where near my food! So so disappointed."}
{"text":"Well, my husband decided to order some food from here mainly because it's 12:30am and I'm a hangry mess. We got the hot wings and a pepperoni pizza. Nothing special about it but it wasn't nasty either. The pizza could've been baked longer and the wings could've had way more sauce."}
{"text":"Always love the pizza, the Philly is good. Their fries are extra crispy, which I love and the garlic balls are super cheap and reallllly good"}
{"text":"So the pizza was good. but service and other stuff not so much. to be fair we stopped in on what appeared to be a busy Friday night (6pm). ordered 2 individual 8 inch pizza's some mozzarella sticks an waffle fries. Asked for apps first. waited 15-20 min then pizza came out. then 5-10 min later apps came out. the Pizza was good but the apps were not. Also server spilled the marinara all over the mozza sticks. she was nice and went back and made new order that oddly enough came out in about 5 min. So I guess we may give them another shot but will probably just call in and order pizza to take home, seemed like they were more concerned about that anyways."}
{"text":"Horibble experience! Ordered for delivery for my house at 7701 WEST Robindale rd. And 2 hours later i called the Angelina pizza to check on my order and guess what - phone person told me \"Well we are so sorry but driver tried to deliver your order at 7701 EAST Robindale and nobody open the door\" (the \"smart\" driver never tried to call my number or anything at least to check if the address was right) hahahahHaha good one! stay away, they are not even on this planet :)  never get to tried their food, but would never order from them again... BAD EXPERIENCE:-)"}
{"text":"We ordered 1 pizza and bread... Placed the order at 6:28 pm.. I am writing this review at 8:15 pm and our pizza is still NOT here... I called at 8:00pm and asked about our food...the girl who answered the phone could care less..she was rude, and when I told her that 2 hours for 1 pizza was ridiculous, she agreed and then stated it isn't their fault...she offered a 10% discount next time..  At 8 :15, as I'm typing this, I called to cancel the order...I was immediately placed on hold...  8:20pm (still on hold) the pizza has finally arrived and sadly, it is cold and soggy...bread is cold and hard....   We will never order delivery here again.."}
{"text":"Their pizza is excellent as are the cigar rolls and delivery is reliable. That's all! :)"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place a good review, food is about 3 or 4 stars if it EVER gets to you on time.   Every time I order there's a problem. It can take anywhere from 1-2 hours when they are right down the street. Food comes cold but you are so hungry you just eat it anyway. I don't have many options in my area so I have given them multiple chances to get it right. They brought me an extra bottle of water to be nice, but I would really rather get my food on time for once.   I feel bad writing this review , I'm hoping it helps someone out.  Don't ever order in a rush"}
{"text":"Every time I call for a delivery to our office it takes over an hour and a half just to get a delivery and we are within one quarter mile of this location. Either get better staff or throw in the towel"}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza. Fast delivery. This used to be Krazy Brothers and was in Dormont before it burned down. The dessert pizzas are awesome."}
{"text":"Normally never leave reviews on Yelp, but had to make an exception for this place. Ordered here because it was a nice and close (I'm located in Seven Hills) local business to make sure we can get our food nice and fast.  2 hours later the food still did not arrive and I called for an update, they told me they never received the order even though all payments went through.  Instead of offering a solution they proceeded to argue with me.  Don't be rude to your customers, take responsibility for your mistakes and communicate with  them when things go wrong."}
{"text":"The only reason I order food from Here is because I'm a regular at O'aces.  This restaurants management is THE biggest joke known to mankind. The only reason I gave it one star is because every once In a while they pull off a decent pizza.... and because I have to"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza great service I've never had a bad experience and super convenient neighborhood pizzeria"}
{"text":"It's 10:30 pm, you're hungry, lazy and in Anthem. What do you do? Was thankful I found this place, and they delivered because I didn't feel like getting out of my pajamas. We ordered a large 18\" pie, half meat lovers half hawaiian. Received it 30 minutes later, hot not soggy at all. Was pretty impressed with it being delivery pizza. Couple things I was bummed about,  #1 they forgot my ranch dressing I asked for (I can't eat my crust without it, and the second time I ordered they forgot my bottled water), and #2 they charge $5 for a delivery fee, and didn't tell me, I was wondering how my bill came to $35 for pizza and 4 waters.   My hawaiian was still good cold the next day, but the meat lovers didn't reheat well, it was so greasy that the crust became mushy and soggy. I would order from here again, was decent for delivery."}
{"text":"I would give this place 4 stars. I really don't know any other pizza place, especially in the South Hills, where you can order online and get hummus and pizza/hoagies at the same time. My boyfriend and I both hate calling people or being on the phone and so we use GrubHub quite frequently. That's where Angelina's loses a star. Their pizza is okay- nothing I would normally go out of my way for- although their spinach and feta is decent, is just alright.  I liked that they had wraps and hummus. I would usually add garlic or basil to the hummus myself, but it aways came with warm pita and olives and was a nice option when ordering from a pizza place. What really disappoints me is the fact that it seems that they are no longer on GrubHub, but are now offering online ordering from their own website. While this is completely understandable (I believe Grubhub/seamless takes a percentage and orders are lost) the Angelina's website is totally frustrating and not user friendly at all. I entered my order at least three times before giving up and ordering somewhere else. I would typically give this place 4 stars for their ordering options and diverse menu, but their new online ordering had not only frustrated me enough to write a review, but to find my convenient pizza places elsewhere entirely. I'm mostly hoping the owners or whoever deals with the online situation st Angelina's will see this and fix their website or address the GrubHub issue.  Just being able to order hummus in the South Hills was a pretty big deal for me. That being said- their pizza is okay, but not really worth going out of your way for. If online ordering isn't a big deal for you, I would definitely do Slice or Badamos."}
{"text":"On 6/25/2017,we ordered two blts and asked for one to have no tomatoes. There ended up being tomatoes on it. We also ordered the nachos and paid an extra 3 dollars for the steak and the steak was dry and it crumbled into pieces like dirt in my fingers, the description for them said it came with sour cream and we got none. We also asked for buffalo and ranch and were willing to pay the extra .69 cents or whatever it is for it. Our total came up close to 50.00. We called and spoke to the manager(Keith) and he said there was pretty much nothing he can do about it besides remake the nachos and said that the sides cost extra which we were willing to pay but there wasn't a button to add on for ranch and the hot sauce or else we would have clicked it. They delivered back our nachos and they still forgot our ranch and the chips were stale. Although the meat did taste better the second time around the order overall was dissatisfying considering that we always order from Angelina's and have gotten orders always tasty and correct in the past. Not happy at all wish I could have just asked for a refund because the second time around wasn't all that great either."}
{"text":"The service is awesome! Garlic balls are delicious and I will definitely be coming back for more"}
{"text":"manager at this location does not have any customer service understanding nor can he take a correct order I ordered two cheese and pepperoni pizzas advertised at 24,99 he delivered a cheese and pepperoni and a cheese when I called to ask how two pizzas and one two liter of soda could cost 36 dollars he informed me they charged 5 dollars for deliverer 1 dollar for credit card and was rude  the back of the menu does say they charge 2 dollars for delivery and 1 dollar for credit card use in limited area but does not say what the area is I will never order from this pizzeria again the pizza isn't even that good."}
{"text":"Never had a staff member call me a liar before. A lactose intolerant customer ordered a HAMBURGER with no sauces. So when we called in reporting bacon, mayo, and a whole bunch of CHEESE, they requested we send a photo to the chef himself. We did. Apparently they have no idea what cheese looks like because we were told the picture was impossible and unclear. We weren't looking for a refund, we just wanted the right food, but doing their job right was too much to ask. Maybe if they made the correct order, it wouldn't have taken them almost two hours to bring three burgers. Don't waste your time or money, unless you're okay with getting something random. Hope you don't have food allergies."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb! Ordered a 24\" inch pizza and had it delivered to our family during helping our grandpa move, and it was the perfect choice. It fed 7 people with left overs. The slices of pizza are pretty big and filling. I recommend ordering a big pizza like this if your looking to feed a whole family. Definitely, worth it!. A little pricey but so worth the money."}
{"text":"O-M-G! I love this place! I have ordered a lot of their menu items and have loved them all. I have read reviews about delivery issues... Personally, I've never had any issues. (maybe I'm just lucky). Their pizza's are amazing"}
{"text":"Ok, I couldn't stay away. Despite the terrible pasta (still terrible) and horrible delivery, I started ordering again. And what do you know! Delivery improved tremendously!  I moved, so I was now in their delivery radius as reported to GrubHub and could order directly from that website. (I still don't know what was going on that I could order on their restaurant website since I was within their service radius, but not grubhub before. Hrm.) I don't know if the website was the issue or they hired different delivery people or use GrubHub for delivery (I think through postmates or the like?) but however it works, it's much better now.  I have now had the pizza and I'm very pleased with it. SO GOOD. I usually order either a cheese pizza w bacon and red peppers or I'll get their Hawaiian pizza. THEY HAVE MANGO ON IT. This is big for me. Pineapple, mango, bacon, and ham (which I subbed out for salami.) The mango adds a lot to the flavor, but I wish the chunks were bigger. That's my only complaint about the pizza. The crust isn't as thin as I would usually prefer, but its still yummy.  The cigar rolls are still perfect (when they have them) and the pasta is still overloaded with way, way too much of whatever sauce it's made with so I'm definitely going to stop ordering that from here. Most recently I ordered the creamy calabrese and couldn't eat more than two bites. It was overloaded with alfredo sauce and topped with a thick layer of cheese. It seems Angelina's approach to pasta is just to overload it with fat, which they've proven can actually be overdone. I threw out the pasta.  But for pizza, burgers, apps? If this much improved delivery continues, I will continue to make this my pizza go-to."}
{"text":"The Philly cheese steak wasn't to my liking but I'll try something else.  The fries sucked but most in this town do.   The pizza was pretty good.  Best delivery I've had here  Definitely gonna try this place again"}
{"text":"Was hungry on a graveyard shift and I saw they deliver till 4:00 am. Ordered the hamburger, drink and cheesecake since there was a minimum order.  The food was tasty and they delivered a lot faster than expected. Over all a good experience but the prices were a little high.  Would get food from them again!"}
{"text":"Wonderful experience...previous reviewers got it all wrong. Awesome service and the meal was exceptional. Prices were excellent."}
{"text":"I work right by this place and was craving some good Italian food. I called to place a delivery and she rang up my order and said it was to be here in 45 min to an hour. Being that it took so long I was sure it was going to taste good but it didn't. Coming from Italian roots in my family this tasted out of the can and way too much sugar in all the sauce. Not to mention my burnt bread and my overdone mozzarella sticks and my spaghetti which was supposed to have meatballs came with none. I was just very disappointed in the food quality itself. What made me go out of my way to help this place is all the fees they charged me without letting me know $3.00 delivery and a $1.00 convenience fee?! That is way too high and I will not be going back."}
{"text":"I ordered several times from them and I was always pleased.  They delivered on time, were nice, and the food was good.  I was the most impressed, surprisingly, with their burgers.  I have always avoided ordering take-out burgers, especially from a pizza place.  But they were GREAT.  The next order, another good experience.  The hoagies & wings were good.  My only suggestion is they need to have a better selection of sodas.  Otherwise, I had a good experience and would recommend them!"}
{"text":"I've never waited so long for a pizza! We decided that they milk the cows and make their own cheese. . . because we couldn't figure out what else could take them so long! We were one of twoparties in there, and everyone else already had their food by the time we ordered. Decided that maybe it was due to a high volume of delivery orders. . . but only like one delivery order went out while we were there. . . Either way, the pizza is decent in size, price, and taste. Just don't order from them if you're in a hurry!"}
{"text":"Outstanding pizza!  This place was quiet for the time that I came in.  Folks behind the counter were really nice and helpful.  I got the Angelina's Special pizza.   If you going to name it after your place it had better be good.....it was great!   I'm from out of town but will make every attempt to come here when I'm back."}
{"text":"Correct your hours, you don't close at 12. It's cool there is more then enough food places opened in Vegas."}
{"text":"First off - I'll try them again, so that's a good start. But second, this was disappointing. Delivery was late and the food quality needed some work. It probably would have been better if we had eaten there, but the big problem is that the food was delivered cold. We ordered a  fried chicken dinner and a steak sandwich. The chicken had a nice flavor but it was tough. cold, and the pieces were small. I think if we got it closer to when it came out of the kitchen it would have been much better.  The sandwich also had a good flavor, but because it was cold the bread was dry and the flavor of the steak was lost. We'll try it again soon and hopefully they'll overcome the shortfalls of our first visit. Maybe if they had a better carrier than a plastic bag to deliver it then the food would have been delivered hot and certainly would have been better.  We'll see."}
{"text":"I'm giving this spot 5 stars for delivery of goods, as well as, bad reviewers need to leave the Internet completely.  Everything was cooked to perfection, and delivered timely.  Every other bum, reviewing this place doesn't know how to do proper reviews and,  should be Aced off the inter-webs.  Suck it."}
{"text":"I've never had anything but great service from this place! Employees are friendly and the food is always good!"}
{"text":"Pizza is delicious. So glad it's right next door. They have awesome deals. Friendly staff. We are regulars here."}
{"text":"Never ordering from this place again food sooo cold ugh so over it ... fries were gross and cold wrap was dry I don't understand and they are 8 minutes  away from me  Rude delivery guy man just close the place"}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss, even in the same order. You can order the same dish three separate days and have them be completely different each time. You could have a fresh salad and your friend can have theirs wilted. Today I had my two coworkers singing praises for their meal while mine was inedible because of the huge pool of butter like they just melted a stick on the top. Ordering from here feels like a risk, and if the prices seem high considering they can't even maintain a consistent quality."}
{"text":"I have been ordering pizza here for at least a year since it's pretty good and it's close to my house.  The service however just keeps getting worse each time. It takes them on average more than an hour to deliver even though they are right down the street.  Last night was the final straw.  Almost two hours had passed and when I called to check the status I was hung up on twice.  When the food finally arrived (about $60 worth) it was completely cold."}
{"text":"So I had my daughter order a 24\" pizza for carry out. I arrived and they said they did not have my order. I realized she ordered it from a different location quite far away. Completely my fault. I apologized and ordered my pizza for carry out. The lady tells me 20-25 min it will be ready. So I went back home and hung out for a bit. I returned 31 min later and asked to pick up my pizza. It wasn't ready. In fact it hasn't even been started. They tell me they are waiting on some paperwork from the other store in order to start making my pizza? Cash payment. It is a pizza. 1 pizza. She did offer me a beer or soda. Now I'm sitting here waiting for the third try for my pizza.  Originally ordered at 528 and now is 643. Hmmm. Papa johns or dominos. For Real."}
{"text":"The pizzas are good when they get your order right. Their customer service is severely lacking. They always make you hold forever. They've sent me wrong pizzas numerous times, but the delivery took so long i didn't want to send it back and wait for another. One time i tried to split a pizza 50/50, and they said they'd have to charge me for two pizzas. Still, when they get everything right, its good food."}
{"text":"My cousin recommended we try Angelina's. After looking up reviews of a 2.5 I really wasn't sure but he assured me it was good. They did not disappoint. The pizza was New York style hand tossed, limited toppings. The garlic balls were freaking amazing! I've never tasted something so delicious from a pizza place. I could have eaten an entire order by myself if it hasn't been for eating some pizza first. The small pizza is a normal pizza places large. We ordered 3 18\" pizzas and had tons of left overs to eat for lunch today. Delivery was quick. And the fact that we could order here on Yelp made the process so much easier. Will definitely order here again when we come back to Las Vegas. Price was normal for good pizza. 1.5 of the 18\" pizza fed 5 adults and a 2 year old. Go try their pizza and garlic balls!"}
{"text":"Hi everyone I highly recommend Angelina's pizzeria delicious amazing food, great people A+ service"}
{"text":"2 1/2 hours for delivery?! Pathetic. Guy on the phone was rude and unprofessional. This place is a joke."}
{"text":"I was in Angelina's about a week ago and it was the worst dining experience of my life.  When I entered the restaurant my girlfriend and I were immediately greeted by our server. This was the ONLY pleasant part of our experience. It took our server literally 10 minutes to show up with menus and ask us what we wanted to drink. We ordered our pizza and it popped out 15 minutes later (which is fast, we're not complaining about that).   We asked for two sides of ranch when the pizza came to the table and our waitress seemed very annoyed by our request. We did not start eating our pizza until the ranch arrived. So the pizza sat on our table for LITERALLY 20 minutes while waiting for TWO SIDES OF RANCH.  When the ranch finally showed up, we both needed refills at this time, which also annoyed the waitress. We waited literally another 10 minutes to get refilled and finally got to eat our pizza.   The pizza sat on the table for half an hour before the waitress could make two SMALL accommodations that would allow us to enjoy our meal. After finishing our meal, this server still didn't bring us our check for a good 20 minutes.  No part of this experience was enjoyable and I will NEVER go back to an Angelina's. I will encourage everyone I know to choose ANYWHERE else thanks to the shoddiness of the service and food at this overpriced dump."}
{"text":"Okay, I love me some wings from Angelinas, however today I will have to give them a less than average on their cooking and service.  I had ordered 2- 12 piece hot wings with the hot sauce on the side, vegetables and a pepperoni pizza well done.  What I got was not what I ordered.  I should have checked the order before I left the place, but the cashier reassured me that everything was good on my order.  What I got was an 8 and 12 piece with no hot sauce, no vegetables and a soggy ass pizza that looked as if it was sitting under a warmer for hours.  I would have had a much better dinner if I had ordered from a 7-11 convenient store.  Never again will I ever come here or recommend this nasty place to any of my friends.  Not to mention that when I called to let them know what had happened, I was told \"Well sir, we'll give $5 off your next order\". A whole 5 dollars, after I drove all the way from Southern Highlands to this hole in the wall.  Again, never again, not even on football Sunday.  Oh yeah, the girl who answered the phone, also said, \"We had a lot of orders sir, so it probably got mixed up\".  A lot of orders?  When I walked in, all I saw was one dude sitting at the bar, one bartender and all the servers and the cook on their phones.  Hmmm, never again."}
{"text":"Happened to visit this place today. Not what you expect from the outside. The server was pretty occupied with telephone orders and just kept going in and out of the kitchen. Took her sweet time to take our order. Food: calamari came with black oil debris from the fryer. Probably due to lack of cleanliness. Wings pretty hard and didn't try the pizza at all! Also when looking at the Cash register, saw the rating given by Southern Nevada Health District. A well deserved \"C\"! I would not want to go back in the future."}
{"text":"I've only had great service here. The staff is always friendly and prompt to help or answer any questions I have. The food is awesome and the price even better! The garlic balls are my new food addiction,I day dream about them. They have awesome specials so I usually go for that. I usually don't have much in my budget for dining out so Angelina's is perfect. Great food and a great price that feeds the family. Try them at least once. You'll enjoy ;)"}
{"text":"Wish I read the warnings on here until it affected my order.  As someone has mentioned, take caution before ordering from here, their customer service is the worst.  We ordered the fettuccine alfredo and low and behold, it comes in marinara.  Apparently despite the description if you put this in your \"cart\" without any adjustments whatsoever it defaults to marinara sauce.  We have made multiple orders in the past and this was 1 item in an order that totaled over $80.  We called and Angelina's refused to send a replacement. Eat24 reached out to us, apologized and went ahead and got it taken care of.  It was disappointing that Angelina's wasn't a bit more understanding.  The most hilarious part is when they came with the replacement, the delivery guy actually asked for the incorrect pasta back!!!!!!!  Makes me wonder what they intend to do, give it to another customer?  In addition, I've never seen a restaurant list something like this.  I checked after the ordeal and Angelina tries to charge an extra dollar more to get alfredo sauce with the fettuccini alfredo...?  Doesn't make sense but glad Eat24 had more customer service sense than them."}
{"text":"Love the pizza! Been here twice now both times it's been amazing. Very affordable.  Thin crust is not crispy, it's perfect!   My favorite place"}
{"text":"Dani was so sweet at the hostess desk. Angelina's always has great pizza so I'm happy to have a location near my home. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Garlic knots were excellent and the pizza was good.  Very affordable!  We had good service, even though some folks in Yelp didn't. We got carry out, so not sure if dining in is a little different experience.  We'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza and huge slices! Located inside the Rivera food court and simply amazing. The pizza is fresh and delicious and the staff is very friendly and helpful! True New York style pizza!! Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Just an awful awful take out restaurant. They forgot two items on my order today and wouldn't authorize the full refund through Grub Hub. You just lost a customer. I'll dispute the charge with my bank and get my money back that way. Byeeeee!"}
{"text":"my food was late.when i recieved the ice had melted in the sodas making it nasty waterdown soda.the pizza was cold and soggy.my 4 year old didn't wanna eat it because of this.the wings were soggy instead of crisp.i was told that the manager would call me back and never did.i spent a lot of money on this food that no one in my family could eat"}
{"text":"For whatever reason, my boyfriend and I decided not to heed the stellar 2.5 rating of Angelina's and reluctantly began to order from here several months back. While we were never wowed with the service (workers usually gave the impression they'd rather be doing something else, average wait time extended over 45 minutes to come just over one mile away, amongst other issues), I actually had our box of pizza dropped in the doorway of our home after attempting to pass our delivery man back the food he asked me to hold (slight WTF moment) while simultaneously taking my pizza from him. Gross? What happens to our food in transit? In addition to my pizza falling open, ranch dressing splattered everywhere and ruined our welcome mat. Delivery man apologizes, takes my money and heads back to his car. Lol! Called Angelina's to explain what happened and the lady apologizes, then tells me they'll send us our order again with another driver and that I'd receive a call from the manager in the morning since there weren't any in the building at the time (another WTF moment, what goes on in this place???). I'm ready to put the whole thing behind us until pizza 2.0 shows up short of ranch dressing. So annoying! And for the record, no manager ever called me. Sigh.  It's not the quality of food that ruined this place- while it certainly isn't anything fancier than your run of the mill, greased-to-death standard American pizza, it was worth the price and convenient having it around the corner from us. But we won't pay another cent more for bad service and screwed up orders. Plenty of other pizza joints around that I'm positive deliver better customer service."}
{"text":"We were on a mission to find a new place to watch football, as much as we are fans of PT's, we love 'em we do, but you just get a lil tired of the same old Menu every Sunday and Monday.   It's a place that you always see off of the 215 but you never realize how weird of a road it is to get there, at least we didn't til yesterday. She sits inside the O'Aces Bar and Grill on Post. The dining area is separate from the bar area so you won't go home smelling like smoke. We were there for MN and they had Bud & Bud Light for $1.50 also ordered garlic balls (if you ask me, that's a \"interesting\" name for food) and a pizza w/ sausage, onions and mushrooms. It was pretty doughy, but I like that, my husband-- not so much. He likes the crust to be crispy. Tastes just as good the next day, just warmed up some leftovers :)   Service was good, restrooms were very clean, smells like perfume in there Lil.   Here's the only thing that I was really a fan of, specially it being a bar that's supposed to have specials, don't get me wrong, they have them but... On the exterior of the restaurant, there's a sign that says \"Happy Hour 4-7 1/2 off all appetizers and drinks\" but when we get inside, I asked the waitress if there any specials and all she mentioned was the $1.50 Bedaubed Light and nothing about what was posted on the outside. I also noticed that a lot of their specials are very time specific. They had Bloody Marys for $2 but only on Saturdays and Sundays from 10am to 4pm."}
{"text":"So I order from this place quite often and everything's been pretty perfect until tonight when the receptionist at the phone told me that she can bring me cheese on my bacon cheeseburger that I ordered which whoever answered the phone did not put that down and would not compensate for the order thank you for trying to bring me cheese that's cold on a burger that would be cold when you get here to bring me the cheese love the food but customer service needs an adjustment!!"}
{"text":"I was really looking for a good place to get a good Italian meal so I saw Angelinas Pizzeria. I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs and I have to say that I was really disappointed. The portions were good for the price point but the food was less than to be desired. The spaghetti sauce had no flavor what so ever and the noodles were not drained enough so I had very watery spaghetti.   I probably won't come back as I'm sure there are other places that are better."}
{"text":"Highly unprofessional. Keith straight up LIED to me about my order. He confirmed it when it via the Eat24 tablet when it went through on his side. An hour later I called to check the status and he told me they never received the order and the best they could do was start it now and it would be another 45min-1hr before it was delivered. Considering I received a confirmation email with an order number, I knew that was false. I contacted Eat24 and they were very helpful; they contacted the restaurant and spoke to Keith also. He told them that he confirmed the order and didn't make it due to it getting lost in the lunch rush. He also told them that he offered me a discount which he absolutely did not. So I called back to speak to a manager and Keith told me that \"Steely\" (don't know if that's the correct spelling) was not available and even if she was, she wouldn't do anything about it. I asked if she would be available if I came into the restaurant and he said she wouldn't be available then either. I have a shop full of people that I needed to feed and now we all look bad. It's employees like Keith that will tank a business. I don't care how good the pizza is, I'll never be offering my money to this place and if anyone ever asks me about it, I'll be sure to share my terrible experience. Keith, your unapologetic attitude for YOUR mistakes will definitely come back to bite you in the ass at some point and whatever negative impact it has on you is well deserved. Zero stars for this place!"}
{"text":"Angelinas pizza and restaurant in Henderson located on 7 hills drive makes dinner to go. Their pizza is good but their Italian entrees are just the best. They never seem to ensure too busy at this location for some reason - maybe just good timing on my part. They have a big mural in their wall which is very nice and each table has a lot of room for people to stretch out. Their to go orders are always a bit longer than expected so keep an eye out for that but the servers are great and the food is terrific. A must try"}
{"text":"the only reason im giving them a 3 star is bec of the pizza otherwise it would be 1, the chicken wings use to be good. now im dissapointed"}
{"text":"Great pizza. The staff is friendly and makes you feel right at home. They also deliver"}
{"text":"I am having a hard time writing this review. Not because Angelina's deserves this rating, but because I have NEVER given a pizza place 1 star. I used to believe that there was no such thing as a \"bad pizza\".   The Good - Garlic cheesy bread was ok, but I think most places don't really know what \"cheesy bread\" is (see my village inn review)  The Awful - The wife and I were the only people in the restaurant, they took 15 minutes to give us water - Workers were too busy on their cell phones to pay attention - When we told them we needed a minute to decided our order, we didn't mean another 20 - The pizza we received had the texture of semi-solid grease. There was absolutely no flavor on the pizza we ordered. I took one bite and threw the slice on the table in disgust. I couldn't taste the cheese, the crust or sauce. I had flashbacks to the 99 cent microwave pizzas I bought when I was just a mere dirty basement kid.  - The waitress asked us if we needed more marinara sauce for the cheesy sticks. We said yes and she gave us more. Only to find out we were charged another dollar. I was pretty tilted on the fact that she phrased it as if it were standard to get extra marinara. - The marinara sauce was not good  The most upsetting thing about this place was that it was Voted \"Best of Las Vegas\" so I had high expectations. I also say that I generally don't complain about the service, but that only applies to places that are worth the hassle.  This place pretty much inspired me to write on yelp again."}
{"text":"I HATE giving bad reviews but my order was real simple - there's no excuse for this -  Just got a pizza & wings with some cheese fries (cheese on the side) & asked for everything to be extra crispy- well done - COOKED LONGER THAN THE MINIMUM! When you order food it's usually due to a lack of desire to cook- not wanting to turn on your oven/especially during the vegas summer at 120 degrees! But with exception to pizza- the other food was seriously SOGGY! Crispy wings & fries should be a given at any fast food place with a fryer so idk what went wrong. The simplest of ideas like poking holes in the styrofoam of a fried item so it stays crispy was not even applied in their delivery preparations!  I don't know that much about it but even I know that! C'mon guys- now my oven is on & its sweltering in here now that I have to try to save these fries & wings :( wish me luck!"}
{"text":"We ordered a extra large cheese pizza, the lady whom we talked to was really nice and attentive. The only reason I'm giving them one stat is because I found a gray hair on my pizza..it was long enough to be seen thank god! I know accidents happen but I just can't consider ever eating anything from them again."}
{"text":"Holy shit.  Just tried to order, and right at the beginning I explained that our company would be picking up the bill.  So the cardholder wasn't present.  I promptly got hung up on, but the person was very kind enough to keep the line open while she yelled at the manager, \"This fucking asshole just wasted my time.\"  Thank you kindly.  And fuck you, too."}
{"text":"Heard lots of great things about this place so I decided to try it. Found the menu online and called to order a CHICKEN Mexican Philly. So i went to pick it up and when I got in the car I checked to see if it my order was correct. The sandwhich was beef so I went back in and said that there was a mistake and the lady said ok she will go double check. The gentle man on the other hand was extremely rude. All I needed was to hear \"I'm sorry, we'll take care of it\" but instead he was very rude. This place needs to work on their customer service."}
{"text":"Having just moved into the neighborhood, I was actually looking forward to the obligatory \"move-in meal\" after carrying boxes for what seemed like all day. That's right, pizza.  Angelina's is right down the street and did not disappoint! Thin and almost perfect New York style pizza would finally on my table after a long day!   I did carry-out, about two hours before they closed. When I arrived to pick up the order, there was no wait. The customer service was not exactly what I'd call \"warm,\" the lady at the counter seemed more focused on counting receipts and did make me feel a bit like I was interrupting.   Other than that, the food was delicious. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Their food is good. But when it told me a wait time of 30 minutes, they came an hour and 5mins later (they provide you with a little time clock if you order online). And then, after I placed my order - they had a 3rd party phone service call me to let me know the \"sauce\" I chose would actually be an extra $3.50. Except I didn't choose it, that sauce came with it initially. So I just told them regular marinara is ok.   Overall, I was kind of disappointed. =/"}
{"text":"\"World's best pizza\" my ass. Little ceasers is better and I hate little ceasers. I ordered a thin crust Hawaiian pizza for delivery and it had no marinara sauce as a base. The pizza was cold and flavorless. I had to add meat to it in hopes it would taste better after heating it back up in the oven.  Service with their new manager (Danny IS her name she has a thick accent) is terrible. I called to complain about the pizza. I just couldn't eat it and I did try my hardest to eat it. I asked for my money back the current employee who was kind, told me to call the next say when his manager came in. So i did. She offered me credit and I said no. I wanted moneu. Then for 20 minutes she argued with me about how she didn't know how to put money back on the card saying the receipt didnt say it was by card (though i have a duplicate receipt that clearly says it was). She proceeded to tell me she couldn't give me money back because it was already the next day. I said it shoulsnt be too hard since it was at midnight. She said she would call her supervisor but I'd have to wait til Monday to get it back. HOW DOES THAT MAKE SENSE. if you couldn't get it because its from a previous day, then how do you expect to get it 3 days later?!   So then I called cooperate left a voicemail and the Manager(Danny) called back 20 minutes after; giving me my money back to the card. So in other words, the bitch acted as if she didn't know and was playing games with me so she wouldn't have to give me my money back.  I suggest staying away from the pizza so you don't waste your money.  My boyfriend suggest their pastas."}
{"text":"Got the caramelized onion and sausage pizza, was very good.  Also got a steak stromboli, which was a solid okay."}
{"text":"Here again for Ironman Weekend and this we ate in. Quiet and empty except for one other family. Quick service, food was hot, fresh, and good! Spaghetti and pizza, how can they mess that up? Took leftovers back to the hotel for a late-night snack/pre-race dinner. No complaints!"}
{"text":"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED:  I'm so disappointed in the way that I was treated by this restaurant and apparently based on the reviews, I'm not the only one. The pizza is okay, definitely not the best I've ever had by a long shot.  Pizza Rock or Blaze Pizza is much better, but I like to support local businesses.  The customer service is AWFUL and I can't remember a time being treated so poorly in a restaurant - so much so that I will NEVER eat their again and     My family is in town and had been traveling all day and they were starving.  So I called Angelina's to place an order.  It sounded like the person was new so it took a few minutes to get the order placed.  They told me it would be about 45 minutes.  No problem.  After 90 Minutes I called and got put on hold and transferred to several different people to eventually find out that they didn't put our order in.  Okay, I get it - stuff happens.  I asked them to please put it in, rush it and I would appreciate it if they would please comp our order since they messed it up and now everyone is starving.    This is where it went VERY bad.  They told me no.  That the best they could do was offer 20% off.  Then they tried to suggest I had made a mistake and hadn't called the right location.  So I went down there to show them my phone and get our dinner faster.  When I showed up they were dealing with another irate customer and had me wait another 10 minutes.  Finally, the \"manager\" - aka the owner's daughter came over to help me.  I showed the owner's daughter my cell phone which clearly indicated I had called and showed that I was on the phone for 4 minutes placing the order well over 90 minutes prior - closer to 2 hours at this point.  And then showed her that I had been transferred around for 26 minutes trying to figure out where our dinner for our starving guests was.  Wait for it - SHE ACCUSED ME OF LYING and as if I was trying to get a free pizza.  (ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!)  I was SHOCKED.  She said that I could't really prove that I was ordering anything on the phone.   I mean really, who does that?!  And who would go to all this effort to try to scam a free pizza?!  Holy moly.  I said \"what did you think I was doing, calling to talk to your servers because I'm bored and lonely?\"  And then I said \"Do I look like someone who is trying to scam a free pizza?\"  (I just came from an appointment and was dressed nicely and was carrying a luxury handbag and drove up in a new luxury car. )    At that point I was completely offended and got VERY upset and requested to talk to the owner herself as I couldn't really believe that the owner knew what was going on and I highly doubted that she would approve of loyal local patrons being treated this way.  She said she wasn't going to get her and that she no longer wanted me as a customer and told me to get out of the restaurant before she called the Police - as if I was some thug from the ghetto.  I told her I was going to write a review and she didn't care because people still came to the restaurant anyway.  Absolutely unbelievable.    I don't believe in supporting businesses that treat people this way. Especially businesses that are aware their service is awful and admitted that they don't care.    I hope you will join me in boycotting this restaurant and sharing this review with everyone in 7 Hills.  They don't deserve our patronage."}
{"text":"Best Late-Night Pizza! I don't use this restaurant/bar for the usual go-out-to-eat spot during normal working hours so I can't say too much about the whole menu - I'm always getting delivery in the wee hours of the morning ... so good!! :)"}
{"text":"We ordered two blts and asked for one to have no tomatoes. There ended up being tomatoes on it. We also ordered the nachos and paid an extra 3 dollars for the steak and the steak was dry and it crumbled into pieces like dirt in my fingers, the description for them said it came with sour cream and we got none. We also asked for buffalo and ranch and were willing to pay the extra .69 cents or whatever it is for it. Our total came up close to 50.00. We called and spoke to the manager(Keith) and he said there was pretty much nothing he can do about it besides remake the nachos and said that the sides cost extra which we were willing to pay but there wasn't a button to add on for ranch and the hot sauce or else we would have clicked it. They delivered back our nachos and they still forgot our ranch and the chips were stale nacho cheese tasted like the block of Velvetta gross. Although the meat did taste better the second time around the order overall was dissatisfying considering that we always order from Angelina's and have gotten orders always tasty and correct in the past. Not happy at all wish I could have just asked for a refund because the second time around wasn't all that great either. The only pleasant thing we got from this experience was the delivery lady she was very nice and understanding! Wish I took pictures.."}
{"text":"This place seems to have a little bit of everything. Who knew you could get a take out order of hummus along side of your pizza! Small place, great for takeout.   The white pizza was delicious and full of flavor. The hummus was also surprisingly good. While it's not the best hummus I have had, I would certainly get it again if I'm here and in the mood.   Looking forward to trying other types of pizza!"}
{"text":"Probably the worst pizzeria I've ever been to the staff was in there phones instead of attending us , took 10min for them to take our order we asked if they could double cut our pizza and they did not , very unprofessional pizzeria, do yourself a favor and find somewhere else to go !"}
{"text":"Wonderful service and comparable prices to other pizzeria's in the area. Used to order from La Familia pizzeria on Durango, until the service I received over the phone was unacceptable. The opposite is true for Angelina's, phone service is A+, delivery fee is kind of high but it's because of my far location I assume. Great food and desserts. I would r ecommend :)"}
{"text":"I'm doing 3 stars A-OK only because of the staff.  We actually love your pizza and our favorite is your white pizza, but most of the female staff are awful and so moody!   Especially the old one who has answers the phones.  She is short, acts like she hates her job and annoyed that she has to take your order! The most recent time I placed an order I asked about a smaller pizza and how many it could feed because we had kids we were feeding and didn't want to over order and the lady snapped and said \"well, i guess it just depends on how hungry everyone is!\"  I didn't even get the answer to how many slices were in the pizza! I was like okay.....and was kind of shocked."}
{"text":"They've messed up my order multiple times and expect for us to wait 20/30 minutes for them to remake it after they've messed up the order. It's really frustrating because I love the pizza but when you mess it up it's annoying. I ended up having to just eat the pizza the way it was, I wasn't happy at all. Very poor job Angelina's"}
{"text":"I have been getting flyers, mailers, etc., from Angelina's for a couple of years and have always wanted to try it.  Ordered the special, 18\" pizza and 20 wings, for delivery for me and my kids on a Friday night.   Delivery was faster than promised (they had said 45 minutes to an hour and my order arrived in just over 30 minutes), and the food was obviously fresh and hot, which really got my hopes up. Unfortunately, that was where the goodness ended.   The pizza was a sub-par New York-ish style with nothing amazing about it. It was thin, gooey and mushy in the middle and super crispy, dark and overdone, on the outer crust. The wings were soggy (that does not mean saucy) and not crunchy (I like my wings crisp and deemed in sauce) and they carried a strong, almost overpowering, flavor of freezer burn. I love wings and can typically down 2 dozen in a sitting. I choked down 5, hoping each one might get better, before I  called it quits. My son, who also loves wings, only ate one and politely turned down any more. Needless to say, a meal that me and my 2 boys would have typically decimated with no chance of leftovers had 14 wings and 1/3 of a pizza leftover.   The ranch was awesome though. Get some of that for sure."}
{"text":"This is a local chain spot that's not a bad spot for lunch if it's close to your work or you're just nearby.  Nothing here to go out of the way for, but they do have a few decent items:  Mexican Chicken Philly wrap - usually this is a sandwich, but we always have them make it a wrap.  Chicken, jalapenos, onions, and melted cheese is a great combo.  Get it with the criss cut fries.  Spaghetti and meatballs - Decent, sauce was good and you get a very hearty portion.  Pizza - usually we get it with pepperoni or sausage or both.  It's not bad, but sometimes they make it really oily and you'll have to soak some of that oil off.  (I know some people love that extra oil)  Chicken fingers - Nothing special, but decent pieces of chicken fingers  Chicken wings - Nothing special on the flavor, but large pieces of chicken wings  Service is pretty good, the ladies there are always very accommodating."}
{"text":"I have ordered he on accident because other locations play the game I'm too far call decatur.. then I call them oh your too far call seven hills... they acually take my order and the delivery driver is always so nice and tells me where to order from.. but the employees that answer the phone seem to be confused... so long story short they acually keep my food warm.. no soggy fries like eastern and acual nacho cheese is not brown cheese wiz as eastern has... disgusting.. atleast I tip the delivery drive 10 bucks for being cool and driving my food out to me.. lol but this one for sure is wayyyyy better then the other locations."}
{"text":"This place is the worst. It has NEVER gotten my order right and the staff is never apologetic about it. Avoid this place. I wish it would let me give 0 stars."}
{"text":"Good late night food. You can order through eat24 which is super convenient 24/7. The order came quickly too.   We ordered delivery. The food came piping hot. The cheesy garlic bread was melt in your mouth delicious and the pizza was just as good. I'd never had their soup before and was feeling a little under the weather and decided a bowl of soup would be a nice appetizer. The Italian wedding soup was yummy. Lots of substance, flavor and tasted like it was homemade. I'll definitely be ordering that again. The condiments were plentiful, everything was nicely packaged (got to hate when places deliver food and there's sauce on everything in the bag, not the way to start a meal), and the delivery guy was friendly.    I've ordered from them before and ordered chicken Parmesan that wasn't my favorite but I think I just ordered wrong. It's a pizza place, order the pizza and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The pizza here is always fresh and hot, and the crust has a nice crispness to it. The service is really good, they are very nice and make conversation with me. They are also really good about getting good food out at a decent pace. This is my go-to pizza place."}
{"text":"I have to say that this place is pretty good! I've placed my second order for the Mexican Burger and the wings because they were that good!  Ok, so the Mexican Burger is awesome. I ordered Medium Rare and it was cooked perfectly. The fries are beyond awesome and extra crispy. Nom Nom  *\"Topped with lettuce, tomato, mayo, grilled onions, jalapenos, hot sauce, and white American cheese. Served with fries.\"  The Wings were also a fave. I ordered them with Spicy BBQ and they were so tasty. My son and I enjoyed them immensely. They weren't greasy or soft, just perfect.  I will definitly be ordering again."}
{"text":"Great location, no smoking which is also great. I ordered the chicken Parmesan  after the waitress said it was one of the best items (and her fav) on the menu.  High expectations were dashed when a huge plate of spaghetti covered with a thick layer of mozzarella cheese arrived. After pealing back the cheese I uncovered a small, breaded and deep fried chicken breast that has been cut in slices and distributed across the top of the spaghetti.  At first I thought the strips were packaged chicken fingers.  Anyway, I ate the chicken and a little pasta.  Would not recommend this for you chicken parm lovers out there.  The one shining part? The garlic bread was delicious."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. I gotta say the 14.99 pesto chicken pasta had itty bitty cube size scarce chicken bits with dried out pasta and sauce. That was disappointing. Their  ranch is good tho. The cheesy french bread with marinara to dip was enjoyable. Delivery was under an hour tho which is actually saying alot for the service around my area. But we are still looking for a decent delivery place with decent food. If you know of such a place let me know k. Thanks"}
{"text":"Well just ordered a 14\" pizza and 5 chicken fingers  what shite really best of vegas not at all the driver was so very nice but on the other hand pizza and chicken fingers sucked just being truthful 30$ latternot cool"}
{"text":"To be fair... I'm born and raised in Chicago. We are very picky about our pizza. I'm not a fan of the \"chain\" restaurants so I decided to give Angelina's a shot. I ordered a simple extra cheese, sausage and onion pizza.   In a word... it was ehhhhh. The crust was very thin and kind of \"droopy\", the pizza sauce was a bit too sweet for my liking and the cheese was overly oily.  The service, and the decor, was good. The parking was easy enough and overall the location was conveniently located.   Angelina's is good pizza in a pinch... but the search for \"great Nevada pizza\" will continue.   Regards, CFC"}
{"text":"They lie to you about delivery times and then give you an attitude when you call to find the status of your order. Completely ridiculous!!!!"}
{"text":"I only order delivery since they used to deliver 24 hours but now only until 3 a.m. Other times I ordered were good but this time was a major let down. 3 sandwiches and fried calamari were OVER $50 AND TOOK OVER AN HOUR TO ARRIVE! We had to doctor everything up to make it edible.   This was my last order. Try Cafe Verdi if you have a late night craving."}
{"text":"Yummy hot wings!! And the ranch dipping sauce that comes with is so good! Totally satisfied my buffalo wings craving :)"}
{"text":"Good place to take out for pizza, wings. They have a $29.99 deal with a 1 topping large pizza, 8 tenders, 20 wings and a 2-liter. Not the greatest pizza but solid, wings are good and I recommend plain tenders with side buffalo as they get soggy and texture sort of nasty after that. Overall place is good for delivery when feeling a little rough from a night of reality on the strip."}
{"text":"Got my order wrong. Ordered a medium calzone with meatballs and black olives, added onions for an extra charge, got a medium calzone with just black olives and onions. Still tasted good, but it sucks that I didn't get what I ordered, and it's not the first time they've screwed up my order. My company is a pretty regular customer for this location, just not sure if I will be personally in the future."}
{"text":"The food took over 2 hours to deliver, when we got it it was stale and cold Would never order again from there nor will I recommend it to anyone"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for about a year, as my job is seconds away. The morning/afternoon girls are amazing! They are more than accommodating and as I walk in the door, they know who I am and go straight to the back to get my order.  I've yet to have any issues. Keep up the great work chefs & ladies!  PS - My YELP order goes through perfectly to the correct location."}
{"text":"The restaurant is by far the best BUT I'm giving one star solely on the driver. He's some Russian dude, VERY CONFRONTATIONAL! He must suffer from severe amnesia. He lacks customer service. Why have a job if you can't do the one job you have? He forgot our utensils, condiments, etc multiple times. And when we called the restaurant, the staff was extremely pleasant. But this guy will call you to pick a fight when he has to come back. Do your job right THE FIRST TIME and maybe your job would go smoothly. I don't know. Or just don't work for this great company."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner here earlier this year while we were staying in the hotel next door.  We noticed the steady stream of customers going into the shop to pick up a pizza.  We've been meaning to try the pizza.  Finally did so tonight.  Sent the order in on-line.  I ordered two pizzas, one \"EZ on the cheese\" + two toppings; the other just a pepperoni pizza.  Both pizzas had been prepared as ordered.  They were waiting for me when I arrived.  Definitely better than national chain pizzas; very good, actually.  The next time we want to pick up a pizza, or go out for an Italian meal, we will go to Angelina's."}
{"text":"The mushrooms, onions rings and fries are the only things I order for delivery. Sometimes the fries are a little soggy, but I think that's from the fact that they're sitting while traveling to its destination. The mushrooms are great and so are the onion rings, I love ordering from here they're open late and the food is delicious!   I have never even stepped into this place, I just order every time. I've had great service on delivery, and when I'm high, this place is so clutch. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Really? 12pm on a Wednesday and its 2 hours for delivery or an hour for pickup??? But the pizza is really good."}
{"text":"Tried the veggie pizza and steak and cheddar pies. Both awesome but for some reason I'm most impressed with the fact that they use portabella mushrooms.   In other words great ingredients.    O one more thing, best ranch dressing ever."}
{"text":"Absolute best! The wings are superb. Staff is friendly. Great place to eat."}
{"text":"We have been regulars at this pizza place for almost 2 years, only because my mom really enjoys it. But as of late, they can't get a single damn order right. Every single place we go to we request the pizza to be well done so it can be crispy and if the slices are large to double cut it for my mother. The last five times it has not been double cut and it has not been well done, leaving the slices soggy and easily falling apart. The time before that they did not even coat our buffalo wings in sauce leaving us dry husks of chicken wings . I don't recommend this place to anybody, unless your life is already used to disappointments."}
{"text":"Food is really good. A little expensive. My only real issue was the driver when he delivered. Rude & not friendly at all. Last time I will tip ahead of time because he would not have received a dime. Work on that will you Angelinas?"}
{"text":"Dude..... Open late, pizza, Las Vegas, drinks. Best combination to have! Every time I got back to the house drunk, fumbling over stuff, uncoordinated. I was always able to hit up this spot and they would bring the pizza for my friends and I!   Drunk and uncoordinated, still able to buy pizza from here"}
{"text":"Ordered a tuna melt and a sausage parm sandwich.  Both sandwiches were extremely salty. If you need a handicap spot, forget about it, the delivery drivers park there.  For these two reasons, I will not go back."}
{"text":"I put them right in the middle with 3 stars because I love their food, but their service ruins it for me every time. If you order from them 10x,your order is going to be wrong 7x. On a good day. Tonight I placed an order at 6:12 for delivery, and Eats told me it'd be delivered by 7:12. I emailed and called in for update, and they apologized for the delay, etc...and it finally got delivered at 7:25. I ordered a Philly cheese steak with waffle fries, breaded mushrooms, and a 5 piece chicken fingers with fries. For all this, I got one small container of ranch, and regular fries with both my orders. Two of the five pieces of chicken were about as long as my thumb nail. Not the whole thumb, just the thumb nail.  Two times I ordered before and it came wrong, I called to complain....that process was so not worth it."}
{"text":"I placed an order and had to wait one hour and 45 minutes for it to be delivered, their website said 45-60 mins. The pizza was cold, the hot wings were cold & plain and tasteless! Very disappointed! I had to call 3 times to complain and they were unhelpful!"}
{"text":"Very bad service. Good food. Ive had terrible customer service in all corners multiple times. Food comes out late and the staff is unfriendly. The food tastes good but is overshadowed by a sub par restaurant experience. If these issues are addressed I'd be happy to change my review, but until then I spend my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"The garlic balls and zeppoli were wonderful. We ordered the chicken noodle soup, Italian wedding soup. We also ordered the tuna salad. This being an Italian restaurant I have it 3 stars instead of four or five because if you order the pizza, or any of the Italian dishes I'm sure they will be great. The soup and sandwich were just ok but anything with their dough and sauce is delicious."}
{"text":"Great food !!! They have bang for your buck lunch specials and never feels like you are breaking the bank. Service is awesome!! The staff here is so polite and very attentive!!!  Their Mexican Philly and the mushroom philly is on point!!! And they have the best cheesecake ever!!!     Love coming here!!!"}
{"text":"I don't see the rage. The pizza sauce had a bitter parmesan taste, While I can appreciate trying to do something different with pizza sauce it just didn't work for me.  and to be honest my Italian hoagie was very light on meat. for 10 bucks you think an Italian would be loaded with meat and cheese."}
{"text":"Oh brother.   Just read the articles below...  http://triblive.com/news/adminpage/3730387-74/building-fire-pizza#axzz2Oht5K8F5  http://www.wtae.com/news/local/allegheny/Angelina-s-Pizza-in-Dormont-catches-fire/-/10927008/19469778/-/format/rsss_2.0/-/96m9f6/-/index.html  http://www.wtae.com/news/local/allegheny/Angelina-s-Pizza-in-Dormont-catches-fire/-/10927008/19469778/-/format/rsss_2.0/-/96m9f6/-/index.html  My reviews are officially cursed."}
{"text":"In the months since a fire destroyed their previous spot in Dormont (formerly Varrati's), Angelina's has finally been reincarnated after a long delay in a small, no-seating, takeout/delivery-only location on the border between West Liberty Avenue and Brookline Boulevard.  While I still sorely miss Krazy Brothers, which once occupied this cramped storefront, Angelina's food isn't a bit duff in any sense.   If I had to level one criticism at Angelina's, it's that their pizza is yet another spongy, doughy contestant in the forever burning Brookline Pizza Wars. The only thing that really sets this pie apart from its mostly hapless competitors (oh, how Brookline had some serious contenders once...) is that the crust, while typically chewy, sort of pops on your mouth and doesn't require as much jawpower as it normally would. The sauce and cheese were acceptable, but the crust is definitely a rung above average.   Another weapon this incarnation of Angelina's has in its arsenal is an uncommon dessert menu. DJ J. mentioned the Banana Cream Pizza, but as tempting a read as it was, Kay and I opted for the gory looking Strawberry Chocolate Delight Pizza. Milk chocolate, cream cheese, fresh strawberry, and shredded coconut top Angelina's homemade dough, and despite its resemblance to roadkill, this was the highpoint of our delivered meal. The tartness of the plump strawberries and cream cheese bounced off the richness of the chocolate sauce while the coconut provided crisp, textural percussion. It was akin to a supergroup jamming the night away in a small club.   They ain't Krazy. They're Angelina's. And that's just fine by me."}
{"text":"I go here often and never had an issue. Tonight I had a problem with my order, but the manager was very apologetic and fixed I for me no problem. Even thought I was slightly inconvenienced I appreciate their willingness to rectify the problem."}
{"text":"Angelina's Pizza is really good for the most part. Just the traditional wings are over fried and way too crispy and dry. But the service at this location really HORRIBLE. I gave it a benefit of a doubt after the first time my niece and I dined it. I thought maybe the server was just having a bad day. That's not the case. My family and I order for pick up and it's the same experience everytime. We are all human and we have bad days. But if you don't like your job just find something different. Maybe the staff at this Seven Hills location should shadow the staff at the location on the Eastside and they can learn a thing or two about customer experience. It's definitely not a great feeling going to a place where the food is good but walking out with horrible customer experience."}
{"text":"Its not common knowledge but I have a serious addiction to wings. Every restaurant I go to I check their menu for them and 50% of the I get them. No place has lived up to the wings I get delivered from Angelina's in Brookline though.  Absolutely love their spicy garlic and Buffalo wings and their pizza is one of my favorites in the burgh. They are delivering or pick up only and their specials are very well priced. Been in the area for 12 years and this is the only place we order pizza and wings  for delivery now..."}
{"text":"I ordered chili cheese fries and a Stromboli. The fries were awesome but the Stromboli was absolutely terrible. It's was completely uncooked at first I thought it was cheese and no it was all dough. I called to have them correct it and the lady that answered the phone acted as if I cursed her out. After going around and around she said she'd have them bring out another one. Then she called back and said she spoke with the cook and he said that if he remade it then it would be the same. So I asked if there is another way to make it like oh I don't know LESS DOUGH!! She said no and started to go around again so I told them to refund my money and pick it up. The Stromboli is completely inedible it's not even funny. I really think they need to rethink the recipe if they are all like this seriously."}
{"text":"Great little pizza place this isn't far from home so it's def a place to remember I have never really had anything here I didn't like. The staff is always friendly and the atmosphere is very inviting."}
{"text":"Stopped by to grab some pizza and some wings.  They said it was the Grand Opening week.  Enjoyed the \"Fresh Wings\".  Had the hot and would have liked to tried the Wing Dust based on their description.  The pizza crust was a medium thickness with a golden brown edge and bottom.  We had the Cigar Rolls which are filo (sp, their spelling) triangles filled with feta and some parsley that are deep fried.  A little on the greasy side, wish they were baked.  The menu includes Hoagies, Subs, & Grinders.   Found out later that you can actually choose your crust - thick or thin.  Check out the website for some interesting options including hummus or how about a Banana Cream Pizza!  This is take out or delivery only.  Parking is an issue.  Room for about 2 cars in the side lot.  Street parking is not available in front, it is about 100 yards away so get delivery if you can."}
{"text":"Worst place horrible service had a $70 order and they show up without our pizza after waiting 2 hours for food. The food we did receive was cold and soggy and the supervisor was not very helpful. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"We have frequented this place for a few years both in dining and take out. Everything was always excellent and as ordered. Today however was the exception! The mozzarella sticks were over cooked meaning they were actually hollow with no cheese inside at all. So we paid for a crunchy outer shell with no cheese. The 18 inch pizza was burnt and so oily from the pepperoni that most would not eat it. Had I not been over 20 minutes away from the place it all would have gone back. The antipasto salad was fine so we shared that amongst us while everything else went into the trash. Very disappointed and will look for another pace next time we need take out."}
{"text":"We live in the burbs.. it's Friday at 11 PM.. we're hungry.. and lazy.. what's one to do? Luckily Angelina's exists! They deliver until Midnight - one of the few places in the Henderson burbs that delivers past 11.   It's a pizza place but we weren't feeling pizza. So we tried the stromboli and a philly cheese steak with fries (yup pretty weird combination!).   We made the mistake of ordering the medium stromboli - oops - that thing was monster sized. Tasty but doesn't compare to Four Kegs!  I was pretty worried about ordering a philly cheesesteak and fries for delivery but I was blown away by how tasty it was. No, it's not as good as the philly steaks in Philadelphia (no surprise there!), but incredible nonetheless. The fries somehow survived the delivery without getting soggy, either !  Overall for \"junk food\" delivery that's open late, I was really happy with the quality."}
{"text":"My husband and I placed an order for delivery through eat24.com. I really loved the service that I got through that site. My husband got the 4 Piece Honey Dipped Fried Chicken Dinner with Baked Beans and Potato Salad as sides. The chicken was crispy even after the honey dip. The baked beans were smoky and the potato salad had a nice hint of mustard. The chicken was quite good for a slightly sweeter version of fried chicken. I got the Meatball Parmigiana Sub with the Criss Cut Fries. The sandwich was tasty. I was pretty pleased with it. The fries were soggy, but I didn't expect them to be perfect since they were delivered to me. Despite them being soggy, they were still good. For dessert, we decided to try something that we both enjoy and then two separate items. We enjoyed the crunch of the fresh Cannoli with the smooth and silky filling. My husband's tiramisu was good, but a bit on the dry side. My chocolate mousse pie was light and fluffy. It was a little dry for my liking, but it was still good. Overall, it was a good value for delivery. We'll probably make a trip to the actual location sometime soon."}
{"text":"Had the garlic balls,  the best balls I've ever tasted in my life!  The pizza was good too. Service was good."}
{"text":"Yum yum!!!   Garlic balls are amazing, spicy honey BBQ wings were really good.  My son devoured his personal cheese pizza in record time!!  The Angelina special pizza is really good.  My ONLY complaint is the crust getting soggy from the grease of all the toppings.  Otherwise, we will def be using them for our \"Friday night pizza night\" again!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were home from watching a game and it was almost 2 am. We ordered Mozzarella Sticks, Greek Salad (no chicken) and a half meat lovers and a half veggie pizza. The food was surprisingly good. The ranch and Marinara sides were perfect and there were two Salad Dressings. It was 45 bucks after tip, a bit pricy but food quality was great! Salad and Veggies were fresh!"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout potato skins and they arrived  small and burnt without requested sour cream.  They did not stand behind the poor quality.   Only keeping a 1-star rating because that's the lowest I can give"}
{"text":"I love Angelinas.....they have all you late night pizza cravings. Try their Philly cheese steak pizza!!! Don't forget the garlic balls!!! Fast delivery!! Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza joint!  Their pizza is very tasty.  I've tried a couple different pizzas here and they never disappoint.  There's lots of toppings and the sauce is great.   If you haven't tried this place yet you owe it to yourself to try some good pizza!"}
{"text":"This is an excellent pie.  Thin style pizza with great flavor.  The only downside is no kids which I guess is probably a plus, because the place is full of cigarette smoke.  I recommend this place, just order it take out."}
{"text":"Today 08/19/14, I've lifted weights, drank protein shakes, and ate a power bar for breakfast. Looking at my grilled cod and curry cous cous, looks like I'm going to save it for tomorrow's lunch. I'm starving and I don't want grilled chicken, vegetables, and brown rice! I decided to try this place and run off the calories later. Pizza toppings were flavorful--which is VERY important to me. Nothing needed salt. I was disappointed with the crust. A little overdone which made it unpleasant to chew and was slightly burnt as you can see in the picture.  If I'm going to consume a large number of fat calories, I prefer my meal be worth it.  Although it was good--it wasn't 4/5 stars good, which means its not worth the run I have to put in because of it."}
{"text":"The food is amazing! We had the lasagne, shrimp fettuccini, and Boston cream pie. Yum!"}
{"text":"This the best pizza in Vegas!!! Just moved here from Chicago and this place is better"}
{"text":"I've had multiple issues with this pizzeria over the past few years. I always say I'm NEVER ordering from them again & then I do and something else ridiculous happens. They really could care less about guest service and that's completely unacceptable in my opinion! Just order from Lefty's if you're getting delivery! Their food is better & they actually care"}
{"text":"Failed attempt at getting a crepe lead my sister and I over here with some hot beverages and the want to satisfy our sweet tooth. In hindsight, walking into an establishment with foreign goods is not very polite. Cringing to myself, the lady behind the counter did not even bat an eyelash. Secondly, we ordered some Zepolles and that was it. Yet again, no attitude or put off demeanor. That has put them many points ahead of other places I have visited and accidentally overlooked these courtesies.   Now on to the important part, fried dough is a passion of mine. That, my love of ice cream and my parents cooking probably explains why I weighed 270 pounds at one point in my life. With these golden morsels, I could probably eat myself back to that state if I am not careful. They have the same texture as Chinese doughnuts. Airy on the inside, crunchy exterior, nice give when bitten into, and then covered in a copious amount of powder sugar. Those attributes should be enough to get people in the door, but then the price and seemingly endless amount only makes the deal that much better. $3.26 was the damage and a large bowl was what came out. DING DING DING! We got a winner. I want to come back for dinner one night, but would be happy in just coming here for this delicious dessert item."}
{"text":"i would never recommend this place to anyone! their food was bad, their delivery took about 1 hour and 30 mins, by the time the food arrived it was cold! and the fries were soggy! and to top that off, they for got my drink! so disappointed!"}
{"text":"Today at 5:15pm, I received an email informing me my pizza would be delivered in 5 minutes.  30 minutes later, I was called by a young lady, asking several questions about my order.  When said said it would be another 45 minutes, I questioned her, and offered to pick up the pizza instead.  She hung up on me.  I called the manager, and cancelled the order.  The trust they were given is gone.  That would have been my first time, but instead, it will be my last.  I bought pizzas from Blaze on Horizon Ridge. Too bad Metro Pizza doesn't deliver."}
{"text":"The pizza is always good. Service is friendly. Cheaper if you pick up. Surprisingly their bbq ribs are good along with the sweet cornbread muffin."}
{"text":"Ricky Bobby is the business!! We've only ordered delivery online from here but every time we have its been a good experience. Ordered tonight at 9:45 and it was just delivered at 10:22, before the time expected. We even modify our order substituting the steak for chicken and as a wrap and it's come right every time! This is the second Angelina's we've eaten from, the first one on Decatur, and service and food has remained consistent. I'd tell them to hire their delivery guys as servers since that's what most of the complaints seem to be about but then we'd lose the great delivery service! These guys have always been very nice! This will definitely continue to be our go to for late night food."}
{"text":"When I moved to Vegas nine years ago, I honestly couldn't find a pizza place I liked. I didn't think one existed and that if I wanted good pizza then I'd have to wait until I go home to Boston.  One night 2.5 years ago, I was stuck at work, working the night shift, and all I wanted to do was to leave work early so I could go home and play with my dog who always makes me happy. It was time for a break and I walked into the break room and there it was... pizza from Angelina's. My boyfriend knew I wasn't having a good night so he decided to surprise me with comfort food.   I like my pizza with extra cheese and that's it. I'll eat pizza with toppings too but I prefer extra cheese even though I pay the price an hour later... hehe.  I took a slice and I could tell right away I would like it. It wasn't too thick or too thin. Hmmm... I couldn't wait to take the first bite and when I finally did... OMG!   *sigh* It hit the spot! It tasted like a New York style pizza and it was sooo good that I had three slices which is very rare for me.   From that day on, whenever I crave pizza, I always order from Angelina's. I usually get take-out or have it delivered, I've never dined in.  They also have great pick up special deals!"}
{"text":"The BLT pizza is really good! and yes their ranch dressing is awesome.  The turkey pesto wrap is also worth it. As for the appetizers I'm always disappointed.  The place is super expensive but it the only place open at 2am :) beggers can't be choosers, since I've written this I've ordered \"the Ricky bobby\" sandwich, amazing! And I love the teriyaki burger!"}
{"text":"Best pizza i have had since being in las vegas!!! Fresh piping hot, so good you can eat it the next day!!! Yummy and worth the 10-15 min drive!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza and salad. Waited an hour and a half. Called to check status & the girl who answered the phone said they couldn't find my order (I received a CONFIRMATION TEXT)....She said they could put the order in again but it would be another hour and a half. WHAT? Waiting 3 hours for a pizza? NO! Get your act together, Angelina's. You're a mess."}
{"text":"My husband and I had this delivered, and it was pretty good for delivery pizza.  I ordered him the Las Vegas all meat pizza (because that's what he likes) and I got the Angelina's special.  I also got some of the hot wings which were flavor-wise very good, but had absolutely no crunch at all that I like.  One thing I want to highlight is that we got our pizza literally 20 minutes after we ordered it, it was extremely fast.  The prices were also pretty reasonable and they have tons of specials.  While we're kind of finally getting pizza'ed out lately, if we order delivery pizza  we'll eventually order from here again."}
{"text":"I've only had this place once (found out about Angelina's from the menu that was in our front door) and I really liked it. I went vintage (I suppose) on the first try and had the Ricky Bobby (Talladega Nights is one of my favs so that's pretty much why) and I loved it. One thing that I personally wasn't a fan of and that was the onion rings. I like onion rings and I expected to enjoy it mixed with the BBQ sauce and the epic meat.....I didn't really enjoy it. I know that's probably one of the things that MAKES the sandwich, but the next time I get it, I think I'm gonna get it sans onion rings. Everything else was really good. Will definitely try them again. Hopefully they're consistent and they're not just a one hit wonder with me."}
{"text":"Awful pizza!  Not sure if it's bad ingredients, bad cooks, or both.  The pizza was burnt on the crust and raw towards the center.  Also, very rubbery. The customer service was decent, as well as the delivery time.  We also ordered two dinners with salad and chicken wings. No complaints there. JUST STAY AWAY FROM THEIR PIZZA!"}
{"text":"Stromboli is one the best we've had on the west coast, be sure to try the traditional one as it's our favorite!  Pizza was pretty good and the antipasto salad was very generous.  Service is always friendly and prompt, and their prices are very fair.  Definitely suggest trying them if you're looking for good stromboli and pizza."}
{"text":"Ordered a large pizza w/ chicken, mushrooms and jalapeños. It was perfect! The flavor was amazing. The pizza wasn't greasy or falling apart.  It took about an hour for delivery. Seems like a long time, but in reality we all know that's the normal time frame. Price wise.. With the pizza and an antipasto salad it was about $35. To me, that reasonable.  Defiantly would recommend you I've this place a try. You won't regret it (:"}
{"text":"Angelina's is a place to go when your favorite place is closed or busy. Nothing special about it, forgettable. We sat for nearly 15 min in the dark because the staff didn't think it was dark enough in the restaurant to turn them on. When I finally asked they had to go ask someone if it would be ok? Really! I saw many people walk away thinking it was closed. Anyway, ok to keep you alive, badly good enough to pass for Italian. Sorry Angelina you were so much better a few years ago."}
{"text":"No stars for this place this was the worst wings I've ever ate in my life the wings had so much sauce on them it made them soggy and the wings were fried 2 times you could taste it and some of the wings were  so dry you couldn't eat them !!! NASTY FOOD ! This was the first time ordering and I will never order from there again !! And the ppl that I had her will  never order from them this food was totally disgusting and they were supposed to be voted best in vegas !!!  I fall bullshit and the ppl that say there food is good have your taste buds checked if possible  I had to give at least 1 star to post this !!! And 1 Star is to many"}
{"text":"Hot and made fresh to order. Loved the service- very helpful and knowledgable about the menu. True New York style pizza."}
{"text":"Ordered online took over an hour and a half to arrive. I live in the same zip code as the restaurant. Food arrives lukewarm at best. Will not try again."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by the hotel staff. Delivery was pretty quick (45 minutes). The pizza was okay, but definitely nothing special. I thought I was too expensive for what it was - $32 for a large 4 topping pizza. The delivery guy was obviously strung out on something when he arrived. If you're in a pinch, I'd order from here, but I would definitely not go out of my way to order from here again."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza. The crust sauce and cheese taste so fresh!! Can't wait to eat there again! Will definitely be back to try more things off the menu!"}
{"text":"I ordered something through the phone and told them specifically not to add meat to my dish because I am vegan.  30 minutes later, someone knocks on my door with my food. Turns out, what was delivered to me had meat in it, but the delivery guy left already so I called the restaurant and told them the problem. They said okay, we will deliver again, this time without the meat, apologizing. 30 minutes later, the same guy who delivered my food earlier arrives with my 2nd order (hopefully it didn't have meat this time), but prompts to charge me again for this order. Say whaaat?!  First of all, you made me wait a long time for my food only to give me the wrong order, and now here you are charging me again? No thank you. What even bothered me more is that they didn't even have the courtesy to give me the 2nd meal for free for the mistakes they made nor did the lady tell me over the phone that they would charge me for my second meal. Have I known that, I wouldn't have ordered again. So to sum it up, I was left $25 dollars poorer, time wasted and hungry as f***. Atleast my dogs enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"When ordering for delivery, today we everything was rushed and uninviting. Then delivery comes, ordered mozzarella sticks with RANCH.  What comes with delivery, marinara, wrong already. Ordered pizza and no crushed red pepper and no grated cheese.  Today was the worst service we got from our phone order. So yes, bad review....... not happy but it be what it is."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best pizzeria I have ever ordered from. They made me a custom pizza with no questions asked. The dough tasted incredible and that's due to their special recipe. Not to mention made fresh in house daily. I don't understand the negative reviews at all. I honestly can't see myself ordering from anywhere else in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"We ordered food tonight, we were told it would take about an hour, it has been over 2 hours! We called 2 times, the last time to complain, they were unapologetic and only offered a 10% off our next order \"deal\" needless to say there will never be another order!  I wish I could pick 0 stars!"}
{"text":"I'm So Happy the light display in the front has been removed.  I can once again enjoy the good pizza and Italian food from Angelina s"}
{"text":"So my awesome coworker got us a really HUGE pizza and it was absolutely good! Can't believe the size! Not many pizza places make huge pizzas like this fresh! Some are flat and thin with chewy cheese and doesn't taste good. THIS ONE WAS PHENOMENAL! The crust and dough is baked; soft inside with perfect crisp texture. Every topping stands out so I was able to taste the olives and pepperoni and all the good stuff! Perfect sauce and cheese ratio! Thanks again Angelina's for awesome service delivery guy and to my coworker! Best pizza lunch ever experienced!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I order from here all the time. It's always super good and delivery is quick!"}
{"text":"Not that great. Doubt I'll ever order there again. But the driver was cool. Pizza was horrible"}
{"text":"I come to Angelina's a few times per week. Stiliana is always awesome and makes sure I'm taken care of. She checks on me regularly and is always happy and smiling. It doesn't matter if I'm at the bar or the restaurant, she makes sure I get taken care of.  The pizza is great and the sandwiches are as well!"}
{"text":"Not reviewing the food as I've never had it but how they conduct business. I don't know if it's their direct employees or people they just pay on the side but It doesn't matter either way they should not be coming onto private property/no soliciting (with signs!) gated communities at 10 o'clock at night coming up to residents doors and putting their menus on them. They act like they have no idea what we were talking about upon calling. Obviously it's either their employees or people they are paying to put out their menus. How would they feel if I came up to their door at that time of night sticking things on their doors?"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery... told 1 hour. 2 hours later, they claim they came to my work and it was closed, tried calling, and no one answered. Weird, because i work in a 24 hour hospital and the phones go through me. So had someone called or come to the door... would have seen it. Finally another hour later, they showed up with my meal. Philly was cold and stale and the fries were also cold and soggy. I'm sure it could have had potential but that disappointing 3 hour wait made me feel gross trying to eat it. Plus, you Shouldnt eat food that has been sitting at room temp that long."}
{"text":"DO NOT ORDER ONLINE THRU YELP!!!   This was my big mistake I've made twice now. First of all when you order online thru yelp it's gonna magically send your order to the eastern and trop location even though you told it at the seven hills one. And then to top it off when you show up at seven hills for your order, they tell you to F*** off and go to the other location.   Terrible customer service even when it's their fault. Manager was supposed to call me today and you think they did? Hahahahahahaha if you guessed no, you are correct!   Avoiding this place at all costs."}
{"text":"Voted best pizza in Las Vegas for a reason, this place is the best and my go too place!! From their chicken wings to their pizzas, also their Stromboli's are Soo big(3-4 people can eat it and get full) and delicious!!! I love their marinara sauce as well!! You can't beat this place, you can bring your family and eat in or bring your wife and sit at the bar and eat and enjoy a couple of cocktails!"}
{"text":"ordered online...got there at time I requested and they said they just got order. The pizza was burnt and the rest a wet soggy mess..when I talked to kitchen manager I was informed that it is the fault of ordering a thin crust and vegatarian. Yes they gave me a credit...Only an apology when I mentioned I had not received one,,,only excuses."}
{"text":"I found this little gem through another delivery app and I'm glad that I did!  Some of the other pizza delivery options have been hit or miss lately so we ventured out and were very pleased with our decision!   I ordered garlic ranch chicken wings and my fiancé ordered Angelina's favorite pizza then I got the little one a pizza boat.  The wings were big and meaty drenched in some garlicky ranch sauce served with a side of house made ranch sauce.  I was in ranch heaven!  Angelina's favorite had banana peppers, pepperoni, onions, sausage, and olives.  All of the ingredients were nice and fresh!  I really can't complain about a thing!  The delivery guy was super friendly as well.  I can't wait to taste their hoagies because that's what all of the reviews rave about!  Oh and they have FREE delivery!"}
{"text":"I dont know what to say about my experience here.   I always get their handbills stuffed in my door and after ruining my dinner I decided some baked ziti sounded good and Id give them a try since I hadnt recycled their handbill yet.  I was one of only two tables on a Friday night and it took 5+minutes for one of three servers to come over and greet me.   Once I was greeted my attention was drawn to Jessica who Im guessing was the shift manager.  She was sitting in the middle of the dinning area on the phone with who I'm guessing was her boss/owner.  They were discussing shop talk at first but then it went to an upset customer. There she dropped the f bomb 4 times the s bomb twice and damn/hell a couple times each.  Since she was out in the open Im guessing they dont have acess to an office but venting unprofessionally and with vulgar language like that puts your patrons in bad moods and ruins the dining experience. Whom ever they were talking to should have asked them not to use that language or even better asked them where they were located so as not to impact the patrons in the restaurant.  My server was top notch. Answered questions about the menu and even changed the channel on the TV so I could watch the Cubs game.   Ok, ok the food. The zitti wasnt bad. Not great but had good flavor. Of course my stomach decided half way home it didnt agree with my taste buds and I just barely made it home.  If Jessica hadnt been venting on the phone Id excuse the mad dash to the bathroom I had to do and give it a 2nd chance but a combo like that I cant excuse and won't be back."}
{"text":"To be honest, I am giving them the benefit of the doubt with two stars as their location great, atmosphere is pretty cool and service... is ok. First off let me preface this by saying I placed a pizza order for pickup.   The woman who answered the phone was not to friendly but not rude. When I came down to pick up my pizza, the cashier was pleasant, I received my order and left... All well so far.  After getting home, I noticed that my food had a foul smelling stench. I had ordered a shrimp pesto pizza (yes I like odd things on my pizza, don't you?) but still took a bite of it anyway. It did not taste bad.... nor did it taste good.   They advertise this place as authentic NY style brick oven pizza. Personally, the pizza I ordered lacked flavor, had an odd smell and was way over priced. Personally, I should have listened to my gut instinct and went with a major chain brand like Pizza Hut or other tried, tested and Yelp approved pizza joint.  Oh well.... At least we all know for next time."}
{"text":"Not good for delivery! Gave me wrong order. So over 3 hr wait. Mgr blamed the order taker. No apology  given..delivery man was so sorry. No more,  will get my food somewhere else."}
{"text":"Have been ordering food from Angelina's for quite some time. While it can sometimes be lengthy, food was always good and employees were kind.  I recently went to Angelina's to eat-in for the first time and was not as impressed. The service was decent at best, which is really inexcusable considering there was one other table occupied. Waitress took our order and never came back until our food was brought out. It wasn't until she came to bring our food that we had to remind her to bring us our drinks that were never brought.  Waitress was nice, and food was good, but service was not fantastic."}
{"text":"I'm here to pick up two plain cheese pizzas and I was told it was going to be another 35-40 minutes when I was told it would be ready now . The woman in the front is unbelievably rude and won't listen to a customer for the life of her . She cuts you off when you just have a simple question . I've never been so upset . I can not believe I have to wait this long for two pizzas and a 32 oz soda . Never coming back ."}
{"text":"My boyfriend introduced me to Angelina's Pizza! When we decide to have an over indulgent calorie nite in with movies, we always choose Angelina's!  We order a pepperoni and sausage pizza, chicken wings, and zucchini sticks (I know that is a lot, but don't judge!- haha)   It may seem a little pricey.... but we truly enjoy every bite!   And.... don't forget to ask for ranch!"}
{"text":"Great services, the food was great since i was starving coming here i was really happy because the food portions are big and it really filled me up"}
{"text":"grubhub.COM Got my order wrong the \"manager\" didint even care and tolme me \"It dosent matter how many time your order from us we dont give a fuck\" i ordered from them 3+ times a week NEVER AGAIN          300 this month ive spent on them and they can resend 1 order.      FUCK YOU TOOO"}
{"text":"My hubby n I dined in tonight. Got a pizza. It was delicious! The prices are good & the staff is friendly. Extra points for this location being so convenient to where live!"}
{"text":"Terrible delivery drivers. Took two hours before I finally had to just cancel the order. Gave the restaurant and driver step by step directions. I live in a normal condo building isn't difficult at all and never have had any problems with other restaurants."}
{"text":"Ordered from here (delivery) once before. If it is over $30 delivery fee is waived, but you actually are supposed to ask.   Tonight, guy on phone was super nice, but the food was not. Was told an hour and 20 minutes for delivery, which seems excessive, but ok.   My wings (hot and garlic Parmesan) were ok ( garlic, but no parm) wife's burger sucked and her fries were cold.   I had ordered fries with my wings.... And extra ranches. Well the \"ranch\" was blue cheese and the fries did not come with the wings (even though I paid for them)  Called back. Guy on phone super nice and professional again. \"I'll get some fries over to you.\" 40 minutes pass and I'm done with my wings and have no fries.   Called him back and said the the fries were surplus to requirements now and that I was kinda pissed. He offered for a manager to call me tomorrow. Again HE is professional.   Either the kitchen or the delivery guy (or both) sucked big time tonight.  Will not be ordering here again."}
{"text":"The first time I ordered from here it was good.  The next three times in a row, it was INEDIBLE.  I won't waste my money on this nasty place ever again.  My most recent order...Only 2 miles from the restaurant, the 45-60 minute delivery window surprised me.  But at 1 hour and 15 minutes, I had to call to ask where my order was.  \"It has already left\" according to the lady on the phone, but didn't show up for another half hour, a full hour late!  And the food quality totally suffered as a result - you can tell the food was made at least an hour before I got it, if not more.  The pizza was cold, the chicken wings dry and rock hard, and the lasagna was gummy and gross.  $40 dinner into the garbage can after just a few bites, and now we're all still hungry.  Deep disappointment."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever experienced in Vegas!  While they conveniently delivered all the way from Russell/Decatur to my home near Charleston/Rancho, they delivered the wrong order.  If the food had been at least edible I would have just kept it and avoided the drama, but it was not.  The food sucked, so when they then refused to make it right, I had to get in the car and drive the food all the way back to their restaurant for a refund.  A complete waste of time, bad food, poor customer service, and worse yet, I still have to go find something for dinner."}
{"text":"So we've ordered pizza for pickup from here at least 2 more times since our initial visit and both times it has been close to disgusting. The last time they even put some mini pepperoni on our pizza that was gross.  The subs we've gotten have still been good. Their calzone was also ok. One of the better calzones I've had in Vegas. I have also had no trouble with placing orders or the people that work there.  We'll still eat here if we want a good steak sandwich, but i don't think we'll ever order another pizza from here again."}
