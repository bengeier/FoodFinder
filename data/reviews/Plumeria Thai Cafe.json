{"text":"Visited Plumeria Thai and was greeted by Rodney upon walking in. This is a veteran owned restaurant! Food was delicious and service was great. Rodney made us feel like regulars. Highly recommend, we will return for sure!"}
{"text":"Our two little guys looked so awesome when they leave Shonna and Lianne. They work good with the dogs and always on time. I recommend Groomingdales to everyone. Thanks girls see you soon."}
{"text":"Great meal and great service. A little bit of a wait but all of the food was cooked to order. Family restaurant with all hands on deck. Curry was amazing as well as the Boat Noodle Soup. Thai Herb Chicken is a must! I will be coming back."}
{"text":"This cafe has become one of my favorite Thai restaurants in town. The owner is so, so kind and the food is delicious! Everything I have ordered has been wonderful, but I do have to say, my favorites are their crying tiger beef salad, and their pineapple curry. Go to Plumeria! Cannot stress it enough. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious!  Both wife and I ordered Pad Thai and the Spring Rolls.  Those are all made fresh to order.  I had a Hot and it was spicy enough for me.  Quiet hole in the wall restaurant with friendly owners.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"So Yelp doesn't care if you've ever been a customer or not, your review is public domain.  
I've never been here, but support local business and give 5-Stars today!"}
{"text":"Awesome food. Me and my fianc√© are vegan and they didn't hesitate to make what we ordered. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I ordered take-out. The place is small and simple, family behind the counter very warm & friendly. I was excited to get home and try the food. I ordered the oxtail soup, panang curry, and some Thai noodles. Everything was delicious!! I can't wait to get back and try more from the menu! You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Had the red peanut curry.  It was great, price very reasonable, and Mike is a pleasant man.  Makes me want send business his way.  

Yes it's easy to drive by and not notice the restaurant.  But it's worth looking carefully."}
{"text":"The Best to Las Vegas came out today and mysteriously I didn't see this restaurant mentioned. Maybe it's because they are in a the hole in the walll location with limited seating.

We have eaten there many times and think that is the best Thai restaurant in the valley!

Try the curry or the papaya salad, they're both delicious.

Rodney, the owner and his wife make this a truly personal dining experience!"}
{"text":"Recently tried this place and was blown away by excellent food and service.  Tried the shrimp rangoons, panang curry, pad kee mao and Thai iced tea.  All outstanding.  The owner served us himself and was super personable and spot on with his recommendations. Give this place a try. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Wanted some Thai food so I searched for nearby places... So glad I came across Plumeria Thai!!! It's very small and unassuming, but don't let that fool you.

The food was very good... Generous portions at a very affordable price. And the service was excellent! The owner who served us (I just realized that we never got his name!) was very friendly and chatted with us and made us feel very at home.

We did not feel like we were in a restaurant at all... It felt like we were in someone's home, eating a very well prepared home cooked meal. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great food! Mom n pop place.  Slow service and no bathroom but the food is no joke.  I got the chicken katsu and it was a super huge serving. The breading was light and the peanut curry was great.  The rice was perfect."}
{"text":"I don't do many reviews, but when you find little family run places that just and great finds, I can't help it. Even after reading that it was hard to find, I missed it. Very unassuming restaurant with 6 tables served on paper plates, but the food was fresh and wonderful. While they covered all the classics, they all had their own twist on the flavor profiles. I will definitely be coming back and it would be great to pickup coming home from work. I had the Green papaya salad, Pad Ki Mao and Penang curry."}
{"text":"I just found my new favorite Thai Restaurant! The food was excellent and the owners are awesome!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, nice family owned restaurant. Definitely be coming back for some great Thai food."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great conversation with the owner. Small cozy family owned restaurant that serves amazing food with a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service, fast delivery and delicious food. I had the Pad Thai Noodles... YUM!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome Vegan Thai food if you ask for it. The owners were amazing and so very nice!!!  They made us feel welcomed and very comfortable!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I pretty much always get Tom Yum with noodles or one of the thai curries. They're excellent and reasonably priced. Right on with the spices. The Hawaiian food is good too, but the thai is definitely my favorite. It's a small, family-run restaurant and they're all very nice and friendly people. I also appreciate their loyalty punch cards; 10 entrees and the 11th is free. I think you also get a free tea after the fifth entree. Not a big or fancy dine-in area, but that doesn't bother me. Their decorations are cute and personal to them. Being smaller also keeps them pretty attentive to you when dining in, so I also like their service. I hope they stay open for a long time to come because I will definitely keep coming back."}
{"text":"I had the vegetables with tofu and jasmine rice. It was good. I was surprised at the level of spice. I got a med. spice level, and it was hot. So when ordering, order the level under what you think you want. That way you can save yourself.

Outside of that, I preordered using Eat24 due to me offering at 4pm and them not opening until 5pm.

I got a call as they got back early and asked if I would like it before 5pm. They delivered to the hotel room for me. 

Great service, and great food. I hope to be able to eat here again sometime."}
{"text":"Great place. Love the owners--extremely friendly and nice. The food was great. The spice level was great. And the prices are great! We love it!!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious, and you get a good amount for a very reasonable price. The service is amazing. Very homey feeling, owner is very welcoming and friendly. What else can I say, it's a must try!"}
{"text":"Our favorite delivery Thai restaurant.  The food is delicious & we've never had any order issues."}
{"text":"I can't add much from the other reviews...  I liked it, and would return if I lived in Vegas and will if I return.  It was kind of hard to find for this out of towner.  My GPS had me turning into Voodoo Chicken Wings.  It is in a shopping center behind it.  Actually it is directly behind the 7 - 11 on the corner, so you could turn onto that street.  I wish Rodney and his wife the best with their new venture and hope to enjoy another meal there someday."}
{"text":"Rodney is very warm and welcoming. From the very beginning of our time in the restaurant we were gifted with a nice smile. The food was amazing. I've been to Thailand before and this food reminded me of it so much. 

The pad thai was delicious. My family had the drunken noodles, sticky noodles, and the fried chicken. All of it was delicious.

Definitely coming back again!"}
{"text":"Aside from the fact that it's owned by the friendliest family with much Aloha. And aside from the fact that it's conveniently located in NW part of town. And aside from the fact that it's very inexpensive. 

The food is amazing. Delicious. Divine. Can't-stop -eating-good. So glad we discovered it. Great for a low-key date night. And great for family and kids too. Definitely try their mango sticky rice desert. Best I've ever tried. Same for Pad Thai and green curry."}
{"text":"Rodney is the best, so informative and gave me exactly what I wanted. I asked for gluten-free garlic stir fry and gluten-free chicken pineapple fried rice. It was so nice to have somebody care about my dietary needs. And I just moved here from California so I'm glad to say I gave this place a try and if you tell him what you want he will do his best to get you what you need. Thanks again I hope to visit this place again soon!"}
{"text":"The food here is awesome! I like to try something different every time and I'm never disappointed.. Rodney, the owner is awesome and friendly, a retired army veteran who understands what customer service is all about! If you're in the area, try it out, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service! We had the panang curry and pork belly with Chinese broccoli. The pork belly dish was our favorite!"}
{"text":"Really good Thai with a Hawaiian twist! My stomach was bothering me so I had the Thai rice soup and that did the trick. Hubby had pork belly with broccoli which was fantastic as was the satay. The banana coconut spring rolls come with a chocolate sauce and are a yummy dessert. The good is a little slow come bc out but I think it's because everything is made to order. Very small place so don't bring a crowd. I will definitely be back to try some of the other wonderful looking dishes!"}
{"text":"Good food and reasonable prices. The chicken Katsu  was delicious and the curry was good as well. Hit the spot and gave me an excuse to get off the strip."}
{"text":"Very good service and very kind people. Macaroni salad was very good and only $1 extra to the meal. Really enjoyed eating there and would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ordered delivery from here last night. We ordered the crab rangoons, red peanut curry, shrimp glass noodles and a diet soda! The crab rangoons were alright, you get 8 pieces though so that's nice! My bf had the curry, he didn't really like it, he is very picky. I thought it was delicious! We ordered it at medium heat, it was still rather spicy! I ordered the shrimp glass noodles. It had a great flavor!! However I am not used to ordering heat by mild/medium/hot/Thai hot. I usually order 6 on 1-10. So I thought I could handle it but 'hot' was very spicy! I had to eat it with my homemade rice and the crab rangoons just to put out the fire. But like it said, delicious flavor, I just know to order medium next time!
I believe a lot of places usually don't make things as good when people order delivery, but this place definitely gave me some good stuff! The delivery took a little long but maybe it was busy, and it didn't matter once the food came. I'll definitely order from here againr"}
{"text":"Excellent food. I ordered the papaya salad and katsu. Very good. Can't wait to order again!"}
{"text":"Got appetizer fried beef jerky. Fantastic.
Got chicken katsu with peanut sauce and paid a lil extra for the chili sauce also.. Very good chicken,,, didn't care for the peanut sauce just a lil to spicy for me..(I'm a lightweight on spice) but I loved it with the chili sauce. 
The Mac salad it comes with is amazing. 
The owner and owners son were absolutely the friendliest owners I have ever met. They alone show how customer service should be. This is pretty far from where I live and we came based on yelp ... .
We were not disappointed!!! Will be back!!! 
Aloha"}
{"text":"This place is affordable, great portion size, excellent flavor, friendly delivery. I had theTom Yum Thai Hot and Sour Soup with Fish, Red Curry with Chicken, Spicy Thai Basil Stir Fry with Chicken, Jasmine Rice with all, and a Thai Chai Tea and EVERYTHING was fantastic. The only thing that could have made this meal better for me is a higher end fish for the soup, but that is not a complaint, the fish was still great."}
{"text":"My Co-worker Giancarlo insisted that I go there for lunch today. I did and the place is Wonderful! I had the Chicken Red Curry and Crab Rangoon. It was Delicious! So much food I'll be having the leftovers for dinner. The owner is super nice too. I'll be back :)"}
{"text":"I totally understand why this place has such high reviews.  The food and service are really incredible.  I had the chicken chow fun, katsu for the kids, and pork belly with Chinese broccoli for my husband and we were all happy with our food.  For dessert, the sticky rice with mango is something to go back for.  

We will definitely be back again to try more dishes.  My husband came here a few times without us and brought is over to try it and I highly recommend it, too!  The prices are good and the sizes are good, but what counts is the quality."}
{"text":"Saw this new place on Eat 24 app and gave it a shot. The delivery person was really nice and the food is probably the best Thai food that delivers in the area. I got the ribs and beef Thai salad. 

Definitely recommend this place and will be ordering again in the near future!"}
{"text":"Got the Pad Thai and my boyfriend got chicken yellow curry. My Pad Thai was okay but I would never order it again. Me and my boyfriend are regulars at Archi's Thai Cafe and we get the same things there and it's a million times better. I will recommend Archi's to anyone, even when you save their food and eat it as leftovers it's a lot better than this place's food when it's fresh."}
{"text":"Food is great. Just  a lil spicy. 

They have big servings. Only ordered 2 but it can feed atleast 4 people. 

Price is reasonable.

The guy who took our order (must be the owner) is nice and friendly as well as the cook. 

Only cons is its small, they don't have a sign so we kinda got lost looking for it. And theres no restroom."}
{"text":"Great Thai fusion place to lunch at in the neighborhood. The panang sauce on katsu chicken was amazingly good.   Compliments to the chef."}
{"text":"Real THAI FOOD PLUS!!  When I walked in, I was a little worried but the food was fantastic.. Oxtail soup, mango sticky rice, pad see ew chicken & rice / noodles perfect... Our new Thai food to go pit stop...  I approve this message J K KUHL from EARTH 2.0"}
{"text":"Came here with my bf hoping to find some good curry for the chilly weather. The Yellow Curry was amazing! The owners were so friendly and attentive. It's a cute little mom and pop Thai restaurant. I would definitely go back especially because they are Vegan friendly!"}
{"text":"My new favorite! Delicious fresh food, friendly people, and they deliver!!! This will be my new go to place and I'm telling all of my friends. I ordered mild and the food came waaay spicy though. I would hate to see what the spicy option tasted like. The flavors were excellent and complex though. Pad Thai, and papaya salad were my favorite."}
{"text":"Great choice for Thai/Hawaiian food in the NW part of the valley. I opted to try based on the great reviews of my fellow Yelpers.  This was my first time and I ordered take-out.

I agree to order a level down on spiciness.  I'm usually about an 8 at most Thai places. I ordered a \"medium\" here and it was just right. I wouldn't have wanted it any spicier. It was pretty awesome that I could smell the heat on my drive home. 

Staff was super friendly and I was warmly welcomed by a young family member. A true Aloha experience. 

Follow them on Facebook. This a a small, family run establishment so any updates on hours/closures will be posted there. 

*Like other small restaurants, there is no public restroom* 
(near a 7-11 in case of bathroom emergency)"}
{"text":"Last night I stopped here for a quick dinner for the first time. The place is quite small, more like a food-to-go kinda place rather than sit-down restaurant. However, they do have 4-5 tables for a maximum capacity of 15 people or so if you'd like to eat there. Their food is a blend of Thai and Hawaiian cuisine. The service was very good. The owner and his nephew, I believe, who were in the front offered very polite and friendly customer service. They checked on my fiance and I a few times before and after the food came out. We got a red curry with chicken and papaya salad (both at medium spicy). The food itself was a 8/10 in my opinion. It was definitely above average but I've also had better. The spice level was no joke. If you're not a spicy food eater, a medium will burn your mouth off.  I'm used to spicy food and I can say their medium level of spicy was much more intense than a regular medium you would get in other Thai places. Overall I had a good experience there and would come back."}
{"text":"Very good and authentic Thai food and good prices! Good customer service, quickly fixed a previous issue. Thank you"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to trying this place after seeing that this was one of the few Thai restaurants in the area that had high reviews. Thai food happens to be one of my favorites and after trying this place, I was extremely disappointed. The food had absolutely no flavor at all. I was extremely disappointed in the mango sticky rice, the rice was very dry with no sauce. The Tom Kha soup I ordered had no flavor, tasted like salted coconut milk with chicken and noodles. Very disappointed. The only decent part of my order were the egg rolls and that was it. I feel like I wasted my money."}
{"text":"There is a reason why this place has 5 stars!  With a plethora of Asian places to eat in this city, you need to stand out and this place definitely does!  I've eaten here last year and make it a point to come here as many times as I can when I'm in Vegas and you should too."}
{"text":"Thank God this little spot finally resumed their lunch hours, I was beginning to think I'd never get to give them a try! The menu of Hawaiian and Thai specials perfectly represents the marriage of the couple who own and operate this grab-and-go joint, Rodney and Phong. They're some of the sweetest people I've come across, putting out some truly home-style eats.

I originally went in for a Thai salad with shrimp, but changed my order to the short ribs with peanut sauce- maybe I just haven't heard of it, or it's simply different from my usual fare, but the super-tender ribs and that awesome sauce made a perfect Aloha Friday lunch with sides of rice and their unique potato-mac salad hybrid. I came back for some soup when feeling under the weather, ordering it extra hot, and it totally did the trick. A friend swears by their red curry with tofu, so I'll have to try that or some of their noodle dishes next."}
{"text":"I highly recommend the Plumeria restaurant. It's a small restaurant. Look for their sign in the window. The food is so delicious. I can't wait to go back and try everything on the menu. The owners are all about you having a great experience in their restaurant. We ordered the Crab Rangoon, Drunkards Noodles, and Red Peanut Curry."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I live in Wahiawa, on the island of Oahu.  For almsit a whole year we did not know about the hidden treasure that was Plumeria Thai. We were very sad when they had to leave us.

In July, we went to Vegas and-no questions asked-we made it a point to visit our favorite Thai joint at least 3 times in one week.  Our first day there, we had an amazing lunch!

Service feels like you're over at your uncle's and aunt's house, ready to sit down and talk story.  We never feel they're in a bad mood.  Always asking about our day.  Checking if the food is delicious. 

Place is clean. 

And the food is spectacular! Personal faves are the pork belly and Chinese broccoli,  panang curry, the green curry, the gai tod, and the crab ragoons! Prices are reasonable. Portions are generous.  

I cannot wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"I order take out from this Thai place about once a week and it's never disappointing! Everything I've tried so far has been delicious! The delivery is also fairly quick. Definitely recommend to try their sweet potato fries, the sweet banana rolls, and their garlic stir fry!"}
{"text":"Da food is good that's about it! My son loves da chicken rice soup n so does da other half, I like da ox tail soup. Da aloha spirit is here! Unko n auntie there are awesome."}
{"text":"Spicy! They have a heat level called \"Thai Hot\". I'm no Thai, but I do seek out foods like Ghost Pepper hot wings because I hate myself. I digress; this place is spicy. Legitimately spicy. And it hurts so good. So delicious. I will be back so many times.

For such a little tiny hole-in-the-wall kind of place, they have big flavors. The owner came out and spoke with us, a little bit of small talk, and he seems like a really genuinely nice guy. Gave us recommendations, a bit of history on some of the menu items, etc. but never got the point where we wanted him to go away so we could eat. Great service. The food also tasted great! Like I said, big flavors. Everything was well cooked and well seasoned. 

I had a chicken curry with rice and it was *awesome*. I got it Thai Hot, which was legitimately hot. Not often I can say that about a place! I ate everything on my plate, used about a dozen napkins to wipe the sweat from my forehead and nose and drank a half-gallon of water in the process. I regret nothing!

My wife also enjoyed her food very much, and this place has been put on our short list of Thai places to go."}
{"text":"Owner was super sweet when assisting us with our choices! Thai food was absolutely delicious ( I loved the vegi spring rolls and noodles). They also had vegan alternatives which is wonderful as I enjoy having that choice. I love supporting small businesses and this is one to check out just be sure to look at the windows for a sign as there is no sign above the restaurant!"}
{"text":"I was in the area and used Yelp to find some food close-bye. I was very lucky to find this place. First the owner was so nice. We talked for a bit and I learned a lot about him and his wife (who are the only people who work at their place).  I then learned that he made beef jerky that was also for sale at the restaurant. I bought a bag, placed an order, and waited for a short time. 

The food was so delicious! I got a few different things and everything was perfect.  I already told some people about this place.  Great experience (and the beef jerky was yummy)!"}
{"text":"This is a true hidden gem - family run and great tasting! Rodney and his family run a great restaurant that is attentive to dine in and phone ordering guests alike. 

We got the yellow curry, pad see ew, and volcano chicken. The yellow curry was a huge bowl of curry filled with vegetables, chicken and plenty of sauce (served with rice of course). The pad see ew was a large portion and tasty as well. Unfortunately for me, hot was a little too hot but I still had a good amount of it. The volcano chicken was two thighs covered in sweet and spicy sauce and served with macaroni salad and rice. It was hot but sweet too.

Like I said, this is a true mom and pop place and Rodney, retired army sergeant first class, is a great host along with the rest of his family.  If you want great food without blowing tons of money, an intimate feeling restaurant, this is the place. 

(Note: there's no public restroom so if you need to go, might want to go before/after the trip here)"}
{"text":"Wow what a treat to have this superb Thai restaurant open in the neighborhood. The food is terrific and there is more variety and authentic dishes than the typical Thai carry out (try some of the Hawaiian dishes!). The proprietor is really nice and obviously cares a great deal about the customer. We'll be back again and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again....oh yeah and try the beef jerky!!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I adore this mom and pop restaurant. They have a lot of gluten free options. I called before making our first order to double check on gluten free and they were really friendly. My husband orders the tom ka soup and it smells heavenly. Tastes as good as it smells, too. My go to order is the yellow curry. It is creamy and spicy and paired with the perfectly cooked rice makes me very happy. We already can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I love this place. I've tried quite a few of their dishes now and have not once been let down. The food is excellent and filling.  The service is quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Everything was so good! We went in and ordered take out. The owners were really nice and while we waited for our food, we hung out with their son. He told us all about the food, how it is made, and what his favorites were. He was really sweet... Our food came fast and it was delicious! I had the chicken pad Thai and my husband had the Katsu chicken with peanut sauce. Both were so delicious! I can't wait to come back and try more! Oh!! They also make beef jerky and my husband loved it so much it was gone by the next day... I never even got to try it!"}
{"text":"Little hard to spot the location at night,  but well worth the effort!  Reminded me of the mom & pop eateries back in Hawaii, where there was plenty of aloha spirit and you felt welcomed and at ease.  If you were a fan of their restaurant in Wahiawa, be glad you can stop in when you come to Vegas, and enjoy the garlicky pork belly with Chinese broccoli.  My BF had the fried chicken with Thai herbs and I loved helping him devour the crunchy, nicely seasoned thighs.  We both shared a huge, steaming bowl of clear seafood Tom yum soup. Generous portions of shrimp, crab legs, scallops, tender calamari rings, mussels and fragrant herbs in a savory broth. The owners are very friendly people who seem to love what they do and take enjoyment in serving delicious meals.  Mahalo Rodney and family--we'll see you again!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and excellent service! Will definitely come back! The Pad Thai and Panang curry were both delicious!!"}
{"text":"Food was delish! Ordered delivery the gentleman who took my order was very polite and friendly. Took about 45 minutes to get my food which is great. Everything was fresh and correct. It was our first time ordering but we will definitely be ordering again!"}
{"text":"Super super delicious! The owners of the restaurant are from Hawaii and I had the best time talking to them about their experience over there and how they brought Plumeria Thai Las Vegas. They are so delicious. I highly recommend the Pad Siew and Katsu Wih Peanut Sauce! Service was quick and fast too"}
{"text":"Went here tonight for takeout...I had chicken stay and chicken katsu....very impressed with service and the food..also got free desert and the owner told me about the check in to get a free Thai tea..score!!!  I will definetly be back to try other things on the menu"}
{"text":"Love love love coming to this place! It's a little hole in the wall that everyone has to check out. The owners are from Hawaii so you definitely fee the ALOHA SPIRIT. The owners are so sweet and my little one had fun playing with the husband who was working up front while the wife cooked the yummy food."}
{"text":"A mom-and-pop hole-in-the-wall that offers delicious Thai and Hawaiian-Thai fusion dishes. The spice levels are no joke, especially the \"Thai hot\" spice level.

There's not a ton of room to dine in; there are about 3 small round tables that could fit 2-4 people, and  the largest table set (2 square tables set together) could fit maybe 6 people. I'm guessing most of the business is through takeout or delivery.

The chicken katsu with Thai peanut curry is a great fusion that adds some Thai flavor to the staple chicken katsu curry, savory with just a bit of sweetness.

The hotter-than-hell fried rice is very flavorful, and when the spice really kicks in around the 5th mouthful, it's like eating a dish of delicious lava. When owner, Rodney, states both \"hotter-than-hell\" and \"Thai hot\", he's not messing around. I'm a big fan of foods that really are as hot as advertised, so this is a good thing.

Because it is a mom-and-pop joint, it can occasionally take longer-than-normal to get your food once you order, especially if it's with a group. To be safe, I'd recommend calling ahead with your order, especially if you have a time limit (aka, lunch break).

Overall, it's a great little pseudo-hidden-gem, and I'm eager to explore more of their menu selections."}
{"text":"Delicious, delicious, delicious!!!! So happy to have found this place!!!! The owner and his family are so warm and friendly, and the food was great!!! The chicken skewers with peanut sauce were out of this world and they came with a delicious cucumber salad, his beef jerky is Fantastic going back tonight for both!!!!!"}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum. 
I was worried, as I usually am eating out because I have celiac disease so the gluten thing is more than the fad diet, it's a literal poison to me. The guy taking my order was very helpful and walked me through the foods even helping to explain the different strains of rice.
I like spicy food and after the explanation of what the levels were I chose 'Hot' thinking that the most hot levels are simply mild to me. Hot was very nice and accurately described. My mouth is still hot after finishing my meal and it was not so hot as to need to wash it down after every bite. 
This was my first visit and the experience will bring me back soon and I'll probably stick with hot but will test their \"Thai Hot\" at some point as my mouth has already cooled down typing this review.
BTW, don't look for a big sign above the business with the store name - Their sign is in the window. The business is all the way towards the end of the building nearest to Rainbow Blvd."}
{"text":"I was craving Thai food and found this place via Yelp. Once I got there, it was even better to know there was a little taste of Hawaii on their menu! Being from Hawaii, the owners are so friendly and treated us like Ohana. I had the Panang Curry with chicken which was very delicious. Their banana coconut spring rolls was soo good that this filipino was impressed! Whoever rated them with a 1 star review don't know good food when it's made right...that's what you call amateurs in the culinary world. Rodney and Pong, you guys are wonderful!"}
{"text":"This is officially my new favorite Thai spot. The owners are very very nice people. I put in an order online (though Yelp) then headed to the store. Note it is hard to see at night because they don't have a very big sign so keep your eyes peeled. 

The prices are very affordable and the food....Oh man let me tell you the food... IS AMAZING! I ordered the Thai Hotter then Hell Basil Fried Rice and let me tell you hotter than hell is correct!!! I like spicy so I went for the Hot, and it hit the spot!!!! With the first bite I was on my way to Yummy Town . My Boyfriend ordered the Thai Drunkards Noodles and he was on cloud 9. 

Everything was awesome. Like I said before this is my new favorite Thai spot. 
I also like to support my fellow veterans! Thanks for your Service!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food and a very nice gentleman behind the counter. I had the bamboo shoot stirfry and it was quite good. My brother had the oxtail soup and it is to die for. It's like a Taiwanese oxtail soup mixed with Tom Yum, a heavy meaty flavor cut with kefir lime, basil and lemongrass.

They don't have a sign, but they are tucked in behind Voodoo wings next to cash1 on Cheyenne. Very easy to miss! But so good!"}
{"text":"The food here is really good. I love good Thai food and just found me a new spot."}
{"text":"Small restaurant. The bell to the front door kept ringing and was quite annoying. Food was bland, and was hoping for a good meal since it has good ratings. Owner was nice, but unfortunately we won't be coming back."}
{"text":"So I love this place. I am officially a brand new regular. We have ordered delivery a few times and every time the order has been complete and we haven't had any complications with the food. 

Also the food is amazing. Different spice temperatures, best noodles and pork steak! 

Love the delivery guy, he is always so nice and friendly. The people that work here seem awesome and provide great food and even better quality customer service !! 

I wish they would offer some coupons to Yelp customers though, this would be a huge bonus to me or others who use them often!!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious, the service was great . This place for sure is going to be my new favorite Thai food  restaurant"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about this place!  I had never had Thai food before but when my boyfriend recommended I decided to give it a go.  We found this place on postmates and we are so glad that we did!  We have ordered over the phone and picked it up too.  The staff was so friendly!  The food was hot and delicious.  Try the yellow curry with shrimp!"}
{"text":"This little hole in the wall is serving up some very tasty Thai-Hawaiian home cooking. I'm sure you don't order a side of macaroni salad at most Thai restaurants, but I do recommend it at Plumeria. The mac is not too heavy on the mayo and I think there's some potatoes in the mix.

Most of the dishes I've tried here have been too fishy for me (fish sauce and shrimp paste are not my friends), but I've found a few favorites that I will continue to order. The mango sticky rice comes with a huge portion of coconut rice. It's enough to serve 3-4 people. Try the sweet and refreshing Thai iced tea. The peanut panang curry is delicious. I really love that you can order sides of panang and peanut sauce. For $3, you get about a cup of sauce, perfect for adding flavor to some steamed veggies at home. The location is convenient and ordering via Eat24 is easy, so I'll be back for more."}
{"text":"I found this place through Yelp based on the reviews. The owner is very friendly and the food was good too. It was quite a distance away from the strip so I'm not sure if I would make the trek again unless I'm have a big craving for Thai food. If you are in the area I would definitely check it out."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time the other night and wow. I'm a big fan of Thai food and this place is so close to my house. I got the pad see ew and the Thai fried rice, both with chicken and spicy. If you're not into spicy at all, do not get the spicy because ... it's spicy lol! But, I enjoyed it. Will be ordering out in the near future."}
{"text":"I love that their food is truly Thai style. They use tamarin juice for PadThai unlike other places that use venegar. They use  the same ingredients as the Thai people use like same brand of soy sauce that is more expensive, and real thai basil  instead of holy basil."}
{"text":"Lovely service and food! We decided to try a new Thai restaurant and we are sure glad we picked this place. It is very small but the food is served fresh, fast, and with a lot of flavor by the lovely owner."}
{"text":"I'm gonna make this nice and simple.  If you like Thai food and have taste buds - eat here!

The food is delicious and made right.  I had their chicken pad thai two days in a row it was so good!  (However, I did change my spicy level from high to medium on the second day.  Wow!). The taste here is fresh and on point.  It's family owned, and has such a welcoming and warm environment.

You can find this place behind Voodoo Wings and next to Groomingdales.  Seriously, go here."}
{"text":"Ordered their boat noodle bowl and beef jecky. Bowl had great flavor and the jecky was perfect. I can't say enough how friendly the owners were. Happy with my meal, happy that I've found my thai restaurant that I'll be going to from now on."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. Food is always good. Rodney and his family are always so nice. I got the Thai fried chicken with volcano sauce. I get it on the side, so I can control how much sauce is put on the chicken. The skin is always crunchy and flakey.

I may be biased towards Jollibee chicken, but this is a good alternative."}
{"text":"This is an amazing little restaurant with terrific food. It's family owned and run, and they provided the best service from start to finish. It's very small, and a lot of people were getting take out, but we dined in and loved it. We ordered a variety of dishes, and each one was delicious.  If you like Thai food, along with signature Hawaiian dishes, Plumeria is a great place to eat."}
{"text":"You have no idea how lucky you guys are to have plumeria thai in Las vegas.  By far the best Thai food me and my husband ever had.  We live in Wahiawa on Oahu where the restaurant used to be and we would be there almost every weekend.  Just looking at the pictures makes me want to fly to Vegas just to enjoy my all time favorite dish, the egg volcano, with pork, medium spice, with extra sauce and extra meat...yummers!  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  Miss you guys so much Uncle Rodney and Aunty Phong.  Hopefully we will see you soon."}

A Thai restaurant with some Hawaiian options and a few Thai/Hawaiian fusion options, Plumeria Thai Cafe is a little take out spot at Rainbow and Cheyenne with a few tables for those interested in eating there...but at its core it's a spot for take-out.

The special thing about Plumeria is that you can taste the love. There are nicer Thai spots around, there are more traditional Thai spots around, I would even suggest that there are better Thai spots for my Thai preferences, but there is certainly not a place where dishes are made with more love...and that beautiful fact keeps me coming back. I usually order the Red Peanut (Panang) Curry...either with chicken or veggies, but have enjoyed their Pad Ki Mao (Thai Drunkards Noodles) and Yellow Curry (Gaeng Luang) on numerous occasions.

Plumeria makes it easy to order ahead by calling or going to their website. They even deliver in their area. If you to come in and order you can usually pass the time talking with Rodney. Rodney is from Hawaii and brings a genuine welcoming presence to the space. His wife is Thai, and may peak her head out of the kitchen with a beautiful smile if it's slow, but usually demonstrates her welcoming spirit with her wonderful cooking.

In the end, I'm a fan, but it is certainly worth checking out yourself to decide if it's a great option for you too."}
{"text":"Last time I didn't give them a great review. I didnt care for the curry or Cream cheese rangoons. But my office decided to order thai, and they were nearby. This time I didn't get a curry, which is my go to thai order, but tried Volcano Chicken. It was really good. We got spring rolls and fried wontons for everyone. The spring rolls, I would get again. But not the wontons, they were just ok. Ok enough for us to eat thrm all though. My coworkers got the Garlic Shrimp Stirfry, and the Katsu chicken. They both really liked theirs. We all tried each others, and I liked them too. This time we went for pick up (last time I ordered delivery) I wouldn't want to eat in, it was more like a cheapy fast food place inside,  and I prefer a little nicer place for eat in. All in all, I probaby wouldn't chose this as my first choice when ordering for myself because I do love red curry and theirs wasnt my taste. But for work lunches it  went over well, and would force me to try something different again."}
{"text":"this is Thai! where do I begin? the sticky rice, the pad thai, the papaya salad!, the 808 macaroni salad! 
that's just to name a few! ordered and paid on yelp, pick up was simple! 
walked in and the wait was short! 
excellent bounty for the fare!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for takeout based on Yelp reviews while starving and exhausted from staying with my PIC at nearby MountainView Hospital. Owner Rodney and his wife Phong and their charming little restaurant were the perfect pick-me-up. 

The Chicken Larb w Thai Spice was delicious, chock full of veggies and I was pleased that they took my desired Thai spice level seriously. Tofu Pad See Ew was a very generous portion of flavorful noodles and a large variety of veggies, I especially enjoyed the Chinese broccoli. The complimentary Thai Iced Tea with Yelp check-in was tasty, too. 

Definitely filled with Aloha spirit, serving up delicious food cooked to order in a welcoming setting, I'll be back to try Tom Kha, Crying Tiger, Drunken Noodles...and more. This is exactly the kind of locally owned gem I adore, you can taste the love in the food! 

* also offer a variety of Hawaiian dishes *

** just a few tables inside, but I'd dine in for sure **"}
{"text":"We LOVE this place, we have been ordering here quite often since it opened. If they had a rewards card, we should be a VIP by now, seriously. Family owned and our favorite Thai food in all of Las Vegas. It used to be Pinkaow but after this place opened Pinkaow is now 2nd to Plumeria. The owner can probably drive to our house with his eyes closed. I'm in no way suggesting this so please don't even try. 

Our favorites:

1. Pad Siew- I always order this spicy and I always crave for it at least 2x/month. I'm craving for it now while doing this review. Order it with tofu!

2. Chicken Katsu w/ chili sauce- my boys' favorite here, all 4 of them. It comes with macaroni salad which I end up eating with them since it's so good. I'm the kind of mother that likes to clean her kids' plates . 

3. Thai Fried Rice w/ eggs- A must. We never not order fried rice. Why eat if you can't eat with rice right? 

4. Thai iced tea- I used to just order 3 iced teas, I figured we could share since we gotta teach our kids about sharing right? Why not teach them now while saving a few bucks? But.... the kids end up racing to finish it whenever they'd take a sip. So while trying to enjoy my meal, I'm listening to them argue about who finished the iced tea. I've never seen a child take the longest sip  (holding their breath) in my whole life. Except when they're competing who can hold their breath the longest underwater in the pool. So now, I order 6. More money again for plumeria. My thoughts... support family owned establishments . 

5. Vegetarian Spring Rolls- I have a 13 year old that eats everything but never seems to gain weight. So, whenever he discovers a food that he really loves, I like to order it for him. I want him to gain a few pounds so I never forget to order the spring rolls. I enjoy this too, but I dip it in vinegar instead of the sauce they provide. 

The rest of the menu:

1. Thai hotter than hell fried rice- the first time I ordered this, my family and I just looked at each other after taking  our first bite and fought for the Thai iced tea w/ tears running down our faces. It was definitely hotter than hell (I've never been and not planning on it). I did order this a second time just last week, idk I was feeling brave and didn't feel like sharing my fried rice lol. And... we still managed to finish it by the end of the night. 

2. Thai Volcano Chicken- Did not enjoy this, we ordered it once and no one has asked for it again. 

3. Coconut Shrimp/Shrimp Rolls- between the two, I prefer the coconut shrimp. I like to change our appetizers every now and then and have always gone back to the coconut. Could it be the Pacific Islander in me? Maybe...

4. Crab Rangoon- haven't ordered it again but willing to give it another try one of these days."}
{"text":"So delicious! The best Penang curry I've ever had, tastes homemade! Also had a bamboo chicken stir fry and garlic beef stir fry, they were also very good! The owner was very nice and welcoming, we will be back...a lot!!"}
{"text":"Very good Thai Food! Got some to go food after looking up places online.  it turned out to be very tasty and rich. Im a big fan of coconut chicken soup and it was definitely one of the better ones I've tried. So glad to have such good thai food at such an affable price, so close to my hose."}
{"text":"Holy cow this is the first place where Thai hot is really HOT! So when the owner asks you, are you sure? You need to reconsider your level of spice. 
Food was great, flavor was on point. If I lived closer, this would be my go to place!
The place is small so not really good for groups. Food is made fresh so you can't be in a hurry. I will definitely come back again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"First, the location is next to Groomingdale's in the shopping center on the Northwest corner of Cheyenne and Rainbow, behind Voodoo wings.  They don't have a marquee sign, only a sign in the window, so you may pass it at first without noticing it.

The food here, was simply divine.

This isn't spruced up food that you'll find in any Thai places on the strip, this is more of a home-cooked dining experience, and it is wonderful.  We had the Pad Thai, Pork Belly with Chinese Broccoli, and the Chicken Katsu with Thai curry.  All the dishes are made to order (unlike some Asian cafes), so you're able to specify the level of spice for each dish (which was great for my mother who hates spiciness).  

The owner's of the restaurant recently moved here from Hawaii, so there are several more Hawaiian inspired dishes on the menu than you'll find at other Thai cafes.  The owner was very personable and very welcoming into the establishment and we enjoyed our conversation with him as we ate our dinner.

The dessert. For dessert we had their seasonal mango with sticky rice.  The owner explained to us that it's seasonal, because they're very choosy with the kinds of mango that they are willing to serve to their customers.  This kind of particularity showed, as this dish was delicious.  In Las Vegas, most Thai dining experiences are usually compared to Lotus of Siam as the benchmark for good Thai food, and having had both, the mango with sticky rice at Plumeria was hands down the better of the two.

I, for one, am very happy that this restaurant is now open in the NW area of Vegas and plan to return many more times to try the rest of their menu."}
{"text":"Amazing & wonderful made the food how I wanted. The first time I got a ten spicy heat level when I asked for it. The owners are sweet and will chat with you best Thai food."}
{"text":"I wish there were more stars that I could give this establishment. The food was amazing, and the people even more so. The panang curry was the best I've ever had. I know that if we lived in the area, this place would be one of our regular favorites. You can tell that the owners care about the satisfaction of their customers. And to the woman who paid for our meal, thank you from the bottom of our hearts.  We were moved to tears and your kindness will never be forgotten.  God bless!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious and customer service is phenomenal. Best \"hole in the wall\" Thai/Hawaiian restaurant in Las Vegas. My daughter says they are the best ever!"}
{"text":"we love this place! we have only ordered delivery, thus far....but they get us our food in a timely manner! the sauces are incredible...everything we have ordered has been top notch. im so thankful to finally have a thai restaurant worth eating at. ps- i think its dumb that someone gave this place a low rating due to lack of signage. lol. i think the places that are hard to find end up being the best because they stay open for the quality....not how flashy it is!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here on several occasions and ALWAYS love the food. It never fails to impress. I had to host a small birthday party for 10 people and got chicken pad Thai, yellow chicken curry, and chicken Katsu. There was SO much food leftover that we had food for the next day. I only heard very positive feedback and everyone had happy bellies. If you're thinking about using Plumeria for your party, you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"I really hate giving bad reviews. I must say the food had absolutely no taste at all. The chicken was rubbery. The Drunkin  noodles didn't have ANNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNYYYYYY FLAVOR!!! Maybe I received yesterday's leftovers. For $28 dollars I expect my food to be cooked fresh made to order. I couldn't even pass  what was left over to my coworker.  I decided to try this restaurant because of the reviews. It's always important to try things out for yourself. One person taste may not suit yours and vice versa.  I won't ever order from this place again. You don't always get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food Island style! Pad Thai tofu was perfectly seasoned! Their attention to detail especially for the vegan choices is hard to find at other restaurants. Definitely coming back for more Ono food! Service by Rodney was refreshing and so friendly. The spring roll sauce was the best we've tasted. Rodney makes his own concoction and it is onolicious. Great to be around Hawaii locals!"}
{"text":"What a fantastic place! The food was some of the best Thai I've had since being in Thailand. The owners really made it worth the visit; they're very friendly and even offered to deliver to my home after 9:00 because we live so close to each other. This is the type of ma and pa restaurant I want to support!"}
{"text":"Awesome service, super nice guy from Hawaii, the food has a really good Thai local fusion food. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Hawaii's loss is Vegas' gain! Came across this gem of a Thai restaurant on Yelp and read the reviews. We decided to give it a try and so glad we did. The food was so good, I almost cried.. Lol. 

We ordered the shrimp pad Thai, eggplant basil, papaya salad, and the basil fried chicken. Everything was on point!

Just keep in mind that their level of spicy is just that.. Spicy."}
{"text":"This place is Thai and Hawaiian Fusion. Rodney, the owner, is from Oahu originally, moved to Vegas to start this restaurant. We had the Chicken Katsu plate which was good, standard mac salad, rice and chicken Katsu but the Katsu sauce was Thai sweet chili sauce. Also had traditiinal Pad Thai, very good and green papaya salad also very good.  The best dish was the Slow Roaster a pork Ribs with Thai Peanut Sauce. This was absolutely delicious, the meat just fell off the bone! And best of all, checked in with Yelp and got a free Thai Iced Tea!"}
{"text":"Oh my favorite Thai place! It is a hole in the wall but the service is excellent and they are very friendly! I love pretty much everything about this place. They also sell beef jerky which is sooo good! They make it themselves. My favorite thing here is the macaroni salad!"}
{"text":"This CLEAN, tiny little hole in the wall is AWESOME!!!
GREAT and interesting menu.  A real family operation (Auntie is one of the cooks).  Warm, friendly people.  Rodney, I take it, is the owner and greets everyone with warmth, as well as his nephew. 
But the FOOD !!!
I had the Thai Oxtail Soup.  
I grew up eating oxtail STEW in KY, but never soup.  
In a stressed filled day, where we had flown in from NC to check on my 86 yo Mother, a day filled with a lot of zipping and zooming and eating trash fast food (KFC has totally gone to piss hell) - eating this delicious oxtail soup was actually HEALING.  
GO !  You won't regret it !!!"}
{"text":"Good food. I like the pad see ew  and the drunken noodle. Just a bit more spicy than I expected, and I picked mild. So if you are not good with spicy food,  pick non spicy."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Super, clean. Service is fast, definitely home-cooked flavor. Veteran owned. Only place that I like Thai tea."}
{"text":"Pretty good twist to the usual Vegas thai food.  Very enjoyable.

Oxtail soup has a delightful Thai twist :)."}
{"text":"I came in here yesterday to try this place out after randomly discovering it through searching on Yelp for a local restaurant to eat at (I'm new to LV). Plumeria definitely didn't disappoint! I ordered the Pad Siew and it was surprisingly really tasty! I've had this dish at various Thai restaurants but this one definitely holds its own for having great flavor, quality ingredients, and nice texture on the noodles and chicken. I will definitely come back and try out some other dishes. Rodney was super cool too!"}
{"text":"Seriously one of the best Thai restaurants here in Las Vegas. The quality of the food alone is fresh with good flavors. I ordered the shrimp rolls, 808 fried chicken and chicken satay. Amazing! I'm very particular with my Thai food, however this place is definitely worth it's 5 star rating! Can't wait to bring others here!"}
{"text":"Family ran a restaurant in Hawaii and promised their regulars they'd keep the specials for them. Choose any and you'll be happy. Eggs Volcano 808 - the fried eggs create a rich and luscious sauce), pork belly, and of course great Thai classics. 

Charming people, real food, fair prices, local."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place bcs I love Thai and I love Hawaii (lived there for 8 years)... But after ordering twice, I've just been so disappointed. 

The place is hard to find, there's no outside signage so we circled around the shopping center like 3 times.  Thank goodness someone yelped that it's to the right of Groomingdales.  Otherwise I wouldn't have found it.  

The inside is small with some tables and chairs.

Today I ordered fried chicken wings and beef pad Thai.  The chicken wings were overcooked.  They were beyond crispy, dried out and tasteless.  I was very disappointed since I had to throw away food and upset bcs that's money down the trash.

The beef pad Thai had no flavors of Thai cuisine.  It was just noodles, eggs, beef, noodles and some soy sauce - no sweetness, no tanginess... After 2 bites I just didn't want any more.  Another disappointment and waste of money. 

My first experience was basically the same but I had forgotten I had eaten here before hence the second order.  So I made sure I took the bookmark off this place!"}
{"text":"First time visiting since moving to Las Vegas. When they were located in Wahiawa, HI we would eat there at least 2x a month. Love love love the food, very flavorful & big portions. Food is just as Ono here in Vegas! Pad Thai is bomb! Mango rice dessert is bomb! Shrimp fried rice is great for picky kids."}
{"text":"I ordered based on the nearly 170 reviews and 5 star rating, but maybe they have 170 really good friends? We ordered the Thai salad, pad Thai and red peanut curry with sticky rice. The only stand out was the Thai salad. Every other item was less than average. The pad Thai was flavorless and tasted \"off\" all at the same time. The red curry was too watery and \"yeh\" (as my husband put it). Delivery time was decent, although it might have been best if he had gotten lost. $5 delivery charge is also pretty lame."}
{"text":"Honestly just a ok place. Nothing was bad, but nothing stood out. The one thing I did lol was the amount of protein they gave you in each dish. Other then that, just standard fare."}
{"text":"I love this place. My boyfriend and I always order yellow curry and he Tom ka soup. Always delicious !"}
{"text":"I really enjoy going to Plumeria Thai Caf√©. It's a family owned, small business that serves delicious, hot food with great customer service.
The owner (Rodney) is very friendly. He comes out to greet you and answering questions about menu or just chat a little. 
We had the Pad Thai, and It's as good as any pad Thai in town.
If you're looking for a quaint, clean, neighborhood place to grab some good Thai food, this is the place. I'll go back again and again."}
{"text":"What a great find.  Was in town for work at the nearby hospital and found this place with my co-worker.  Not the easiest to find, but once you do I am sure you will be going back.  We tried a variety of apps and entrees.  Nothing disappointed."}
{"text":"Whenever a restaurant has spicy food, I alwayyys order \"5 star\" or whatever the spiciest option is. Usually, I don't think food is that spicy. I've probably eaten at restaurants with the spiciest food in Vegas, Seattle, and Hawaii. I can ALWAYS handle spicy food; no restaurant has ever shocked me with the level of spiciness in their food. 

Plumeria Thai Cafe completely caught me off guard. I LOVE their pad siew. It's hands down the SPICIEST food I have EVER tasted. For real, the spice level at this restaurant is NOT for the faint of heart. Even when I tell people that this place has the spiciest food ever, they don't believe me until they try it for themselves. Idk what they put in their sauce, but I'm almost convinced that it's ghost pepper. 

The owners of this restaurant are also super sweet and I'm always happy to give them my business. Their 10 year old son once had the nicest conversation with me while I was waiting in the restaurant for my food; he's very friendly and a really polite young man. He told me all about his dad's tours in the army overseas, so I'm also really happy to support a veteran. 

Seriously, these people are the real MVPs. You guys gotta believe me. This place is legit.

Rodney, thank you so much for your service. I appreciate all you've done for this country and I'm so glad that you and your family have found a home here in Vegas to spread the aloha spirit."}
{"text":"This is my go to Thai spot. Their food is absolutely delicious and the family run aspect of it makes it even more special. We love their Hotter than Hell fried rice. For something sweet, try the banana spring rolls. They won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"Awesome Thai Food, made fresh to order!
Hawaiian food is excellent, and the Mac Salad is legit...

Thai - Hawaiian Fusion Food place.

Mom and Pop run store, real Local Hawaiians... Touch of Aloha and genuine care goes into the Food.

They offer Thai Hot on the scale rating if you dare...

Cant Say enough of how good this place is!"}
{"text":"Love the food.. So excited to have Rodney & his Ohana here in Vegas.. Sharing their love thru their food!! Wow!"}
{"text":"I was a loyal customer when he was in Hawaii, so loyal that I flew all the way to Vegas to get a plate of pork belly with Chinese broccoli.  Definitely worth it!  Rodney is the nicest, coolest guy.  Definitely must try, and you'll be hooked!!"}
{"text":"This place is the BOMB and the owner is a US Army Veteran who is very nice. if you have a problem with the order he will try his best to make you happy. I order in an through GRUBHUB.... Have tried most things on the menu... THEY ARE AWESOME."}
{"text":"Food is extremely good. I don't claim to be an expert on Hawaiian or Thai cuisine but the food was delicious. The staff was friendly and family oriented. They care about their customers and their food. You should come by and see them."}
{"text":"Wonderful welcoming little place! Food is freshly prepared with lots of Hawaiian love. Unique no frill  comfort food. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Bomb, love the volcano sauce! Peanut curry sauce on point. All food is fresh and so delicious!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place. Especially based off of all the great reviews. I ordered the shrimp rolls, chicken satay, volcano chicken, and the slow cooked ribs with peanut sauce. The shrimp rolls were decent, but very small for the price. The chicken satay was dry, and a weird bright yellow color. The peanut sauce, which I was most excited for beings I tried it at another Thai restaurant and it was amazing, was just not good. Not good at all. It had some weird spice in there that just didn't go, which made me super bummed because I had the ribs that were covered in the peanut sauce as well. I tried scooping the sauce off of the ribs but to my surprise they were dry rubbed with a spice I wasn't a fan of either. It almost tasted Indian. It didn't pair well at all with the peanut sauce. Not to mention, there were peanut pieces in the sauce and it honestly looked like throw up. The ribs them self were dry as well. It came with a side of macaroni salad which I assumed would be Hawaiian macaroni salad since it's called 808. It wasn't. It honestly tasted like a mix of macaroni salad and potato salad. Not the Hawaiian macaroni salad I'm used to. The best part of the meal was the volcano chicken. It was actually delicious. It had a nice crispy skin that stayed crispy even with the sauce coating it. I don't think I would give this place another chance, mainly because whatever spice they use is not for me."}
{"text":"Don't let the modest setting fool you! This is the real deal! The papaya salad was one of the best I have ever had! My entire picky family loved it! We will be going back! The owner Rodney is attentive and personally sees to your satisfaction while his lovely wife, a native of Thailand, makes sure that the flavors are just right! We will be going back for sure!! Grateful for the leftovers today!!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! We eat here probably once a week! The owner is so nice and the food is spicy like my husband likes it. I get mild but the chicken curry is my fave!!"}
{"text":"We just found out new FAVORITE Thai restaurant! Last minute dinner decision and this was closest to us. We ordered the crab rangoons, green papaya salad, tofu fried rice, yellow chicken curry, and their mango sticky rice dessert. They have this magic sauce for the rangoons...Omg. I've never tasted anything like it! And their curry was SO tasty! The fusion of their flavors are savory. Seriously bomb dot com and customer service is on point. Will never go anywhere else for Thai food from now on. Lol Delish!!!!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food ever.  The place is really small but the service is great and the food is awesome. This is one jewel not to be missed."}
{"text":"The Tom Kha soup is amazing. Even my picky children will eat it, as well as other food from this amazing place. The service in the store is great, and the manager will explain the food as well as the heat levels of the food, which is good for me as a lightweight. I will keep going back to this place. My wife adore date night here."}
{"text":"I would rate this little hole in a wall 10 stars! My first time here.  I ha e eaten at many other Thai restaurant but this one stand out on my list. The owner is soooo friendly & very attentive including his cutie little son. Every food we ordered was good. I would definitely come baxk, shish I would just come to vegas from Long Beach  just for this food."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food and the dish I ordered, chicken sticky noodles was phenomenal!!! Very small but yet very cozy! Definitely will come back again :)"}
{"text":"Amazing! Small place with a lot to offer. Family run, everyone was super nice. Plate sizes are very generous with lots of vegetables. I had the Pad Siew with beef which was delicious. I will return often with anyone who wants some good home style Thai Hawaiian food"}
{"text":"Food is delicious and the owners are super nice! You won't be disappointed! He prices are very reasonable and they also deliver..."}
{"text":"Finally had the time to try this Thai place with my sister. It was recommended by my friend Tiffany another Yelper and friends from Hawaii so had to bookmarked this caf√©. From the time we entered Plumeria we got a sense of Aloha (Welcome Home) which is something we missed back home in the Islands. 

Its truly a hidden gem in Vegas and took time to find this place but once we arrived we notice it was a small caf√© and probably only room for about a dozen people. They also have take out and delivery. 

Our server Rodney who is the owner as well was very friendly and engaging with us. We had a great time reminising time of our island life in Hawaii with him. We ordered a papaya salad and it was a perfect blend of spices and it was spicy to the way we like it. My sister got the Eggs Volcano 808 and that was a complete meal in itself. It was flavorful and spicy to the way she likes it. I got the Pad Siew with Chicken and it was really good with the spicy level at a medium level was really balanced with the soy sauce and mixed vegetables especially the chinese broccoli. We had a Iced Thai Tea and Coffee and both were delicious. 
  
All in all great food, friendly service and cool mom/pop place with reasonable portions and prices you can't go wrong with. Deffinetly Will be back for more. 

Mahalo & Aloha Rodney for the food and service!!!"}
{"text":"What a great place. All the reviews are accurate. The place is spotless. The service and food were amazing. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The best Thai in the NW of Las Vegas.  Great family business and great family doing the work.  I have been ordering from here for years and it is ALWAYS consistent and good."}
{"text":"This is an excellent family run restaurant.  Delicious asian food and very friendly owners.  Great value and service.  
I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Outstanding! My wife and I enjoyed date night here. Delicious and authentic Thai food...warm and friendly service. Family owned. Reasonable prices. Excellent place."}
{"text":"Maybe I am a little bias because they are from Hawaii, but the food here is so ono. 

This is a mom and pops restaurant and they have a wide range of Thai food, some with Hawaiian fusion. My favorite dishes are the papaya salad and pad thai with shrimp. If you check in or come during lunchtime you can get a free thai tea. The price is fair and the food is delicious. I can't complain. The best part is the complementary tapioca dessert. Mmmmhhhh so sweet and flavorful."}
{"text":"First time trying this place . I ordered it online , I got my food in time and it was delicious . Portion size was good as well. Actually I shared with my friend too."}
{"text":"Great food, great, very friendly owner.  Very accommodating of food allergies.  He even offered a free tiny dessert.  Not really fancy.   In fact, the place is tiny, so large parties will want to do takeout.  Definitely will be back and will order takeout frequently."}
{"text":"I truly believe in \"food with care\". I order 4 dishes at this restaurant today, (Rangoon, panang curry, crying tiger and larb salad) loved every single one of them."}
{"text":"We tried this place because it had great reviews and they deserve all five stars. We ordered the ribs with peanut sauce (w/ my favorite Hawaiian mac salad) and the beef pad Thai off the broke the mouth menu. The peanut sauce is fantastic! I can't wait to try the panang curry. The pad Thai was best I've had in a long time. Really everything we ordered was great including coconut banana spring rolls and red curry. We ordered delivery and the owner delivered the food himself. Very nice and friendly. I recommend this place to anyone and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is definitely worth a visit. I tried the volcano chicken thighs, has a hot, sweet, and sour sauce that is really tasty."}
{"text":"Local Hawaii peeps!

Plumeria Thai Caf√© is the newest iteration of this little hole-in-the-wall restaurant in the plaza off of Cheyenne & N. Rainbow.  Let's hope it stays there!

Owned by a local ex-military bruddah from Oahu & his little Thai wife, this place has some ONO kine' grinds!  Want some Thai food with a little kick?  Go here!  Want some delicious Hawaiian favorites?  Go here!  Check out the \"Broke the Mouth\" part of the menu.  Chicken katsu!  Oxtail soup!

It was our first time there and we ended up \"talking story\" with the owner for a good 15 minutes even before we placed our take out order!  That's just how we local people do folks.  In fact, owners prefer if you stay in the tiny restaurant to eat just so they can shoot the breeze with you!  Very friendly, lots of Aloha Spirit floating around in this joint.

When we finally came to ordering we went with:

*Pad Thai Noodles with Chicken ($8.95) - rice noodles simmered in tamarind sauce & topped with peanuts and bean sprouts

*Pad Siew (aka Thai Chow Fun) with Beef ($8.95) - wide rice noodles stir fried with vegetables, egg & Chinese broccoli

It was a carby night!  With your order, remember you will probably be asked about your spice level.  If you can't take the heat, stay low!  We did, and even at a mild level it still had a tiny hot punch.  Me personally, I like it hot, if I wasn't sharing I would have gone more toward a medium level spice.  

Servings of both noodle entrees were big!  One container of noodles would have fed the three of us easily.  Verdict?  Pretty darn good!  Pad Thai was less orange than I usually see, but the flavor was good, more on the sweet side.  Added crunch of peanuts and bean sprouts were good.  My fav ended up being the Pad Siew, I love a good chow fun!  This one didn't disappoint, fat rice noodles with pieces of beef all simmered in a lovely soy sauce concoction.  The Chinese broccoli added some color as well as texture.  Very tasty.

We'll be back again to try some of their other Thai specialties, especially their rice and curry dishes.  Until then Plumeria Thai Caf√©, MAHALOS!"}
{"text":"My first visit here was a memorable one.  Let me just say that for it being a \"first\", the customer service was warm and made me feel valued to be there.  

Their prices are great for what they offer.  I picked their green papaya salad to start and their \"yellow curry\" which was AROY (delicious)!  A little spicy, yet so worth the heat I endured.  

The owners are from Wahiawa, HI and I was recommended to try this place from good friends of mine who were regulars back in Wahiawa.  It's nice to know that the local spirit of aloha still remains even in Sin City. 

Thank you to Uncle Rodney and Aunty Thongmani for providing superb hospitality and cuisine.  I will be back the next time I visit!"}
{"text":"Just found a great new (to us) Thai place! Owned by a veteran who also had another restaurant in Hawaii for six years before coming to Las Vegas. The portions are generous and the taste is delicious. I had beef pad Thai, the standard for checking out a new place. It has a slightly sweet taste, heaping noodles, and lots of beef. My boyfriend had the Thai fried rice with an over easy egg on top. Again, a heaping mound of rice with fresh veggies and tons of beef. Spice levels go from none to Thai hot. I had none and my boyfriend had medium plus. The medium plus had a nice kick, enough to make him sweat, not enough to burn. We shared the mango sticky rice which had a crunchy, toasty texture and a slightly tart mango. It was delicious. There are several interesting items on the menu, I can't wait to come back and try them!"}
{"text":"I read all of the reviews and placed an order at this establishment.  This is not Thai food, it's more Hawaiian.  What Thai restaurant serves potato/macaroni salad?  I had to paper towel the oil from my short ribs and they weren't ribs rather an oily steak.  I truly believe that the reviews are family reviews and will no longer trust everything I read on Yelp.  For real Thai, stick with Krung Siam (Chinatown) or Lotus of Siam."}
{"text":"Great, fresh from scratch Thai food! Good thai food can be so hard to find (especially on this side of town), but this is the real deal. My kids loved it so much we had to order more food. Everything tastes fresh and flavorful and the customer service is stellar. The owner was so kind and shared lots of information about his restaurant. Family owned and operated, their son greeted us at the door and set a table for us right away. 

It's a little tough to see from the street, but it's right behind the 7-11 in the corner of the shopping mall next to the dog grooming salon. 

Very impressed with the quality of food and even more impressed with the quality of friendly service. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Put in a super late delivery order (close to closing) and they were still able to cook and deliver my food. The food was delivered still hot like i was being served right there in the restaurant, amazing! Another plus is I forgot to mention no peanuts for my pad thai noodles (I'm allergic) and when I opened the box the peanuts were in a small container on the side (THANK YOU!) On top of all that the food was delicious as always!"}
{"text":"Food was very good!  The place was hard to find, but was overall a great experience.  The owner was very nice and extremely helpful."}
{"text":"YELP led us here and we weren't disappointed.  All for of us had something different and everybody raved.  The secret volcano sauce is unforgettable.  Family owned and the quality shows.  You won't be disappointed!!!!!"}
{"text":"So this new Plumeria Thai has replaced the old Thai Noodles Cafe. Apparently the new owners are close to the old owners and took over when they retired. The new people came from Hawaii where they had a restaurant before.

The menu looks pretty similar but has a few new items. Hawaiian items. They have Hawaiian macaroni salad and a banana coconut spring roll. Sounds interesting but I had already ordered my standard pad see ew and paid when I found the new stuff. Next time.

Like I said, I ordered my standard pad see ew tonight. It was not the old standard I am used to. Usually it is chicken, broccoli, egg and noodles. This dish I got tonight had carrots, celery, cabbage amd bell pepper in addition. I'm not saying its a bad thing. Just different. There is more substance. While I more often than not would prefer to keep it simple, what I care more about is that there are noodles and good flavor. These were some good noodles. A little spicy as I ordered a level 3 (higher end of mild?). I ended up with a squirt of fresh lime juice to really make the flavors pop. While this was not my favorite representation of pad see ew it did go down fast. 

I am excited to try some of the new menu items. You can bet I will be back. Service was very friendly. Better than it used to be before the change. And with some new treats to try, a second and even athird visit are in order."}
{"text":"Plumeria Thai Cafe is a mom & pop owned business.   Rodney (owner) and his wife just recently moved to Vegas from Hawaii where they owned a restaurant of the same name.  

They have a nice size menu with lots to choose from ranging from Thai and Hawaiian Thai infused dishes. 

Items tried and liked: 
Green Papaya Salad
Eggplant with Chicken Stir Fry
Lemongrass Tofu Stir Fry 
Hawaiian Style Macaroni Salad (for all you Hawaii peeps out there, it taste just like the kind you get at an Okazuya).  

Everything was fresh tasting and delicious! :)  

Restaurant is small (6 or so tables) & quaint and clean. Customer service is excellent. They are very accommodating when it comes to the menu, so just ask.  A new favorite for my family and I! :)"}
{"text":"The pressure.. scared I'm gonna miss bringing up everything amazing about this place. 

First of all I can't praise the customer service enough. as soon as you walk into this place it totally makes you feel like you walked into a friends house for dinner. Expect a lot of warm Hellos and super high Aloha spirit! These people scream they love what they do straight up through their food!

I also can't forget to mention that if you live anywhere passed Craig and the 95 going north it's impossible to find any GOOD AUTHENTIC Thai food. 

These folks are frequent visitors to Thailand and know exactly how things should taste.  They also make things thai Spicy which means REAL heat..

The owner was even nice enough to give me some awesome specialty Thai spices on the side for an extra kick if things weren't as hot as I like them.

The couple who owns the place even threw in some mini confetti banana bread muffins!!! Who does that now a days in Las Vegas WHO?!!! Seriously if you keep passing this place up thinking it's nothing special I'm proud to tell you that you are missing out my friend!!

The freshness of the food the cleanliness of the place and family vibes. Wishing vegas had more mom and pop places like this. It makes it very hard to wanna go eat anywhere else honestly!!

This place is hidden though right off the free way 95 and Cheyenne. If your coming from 95 south your gonna wanna make a right when you exit. If your coming from the north side your gonna wanna exit and take a left. Super green business logos you can't miss it!  When I went with my gf I got the Panang curry which is the red bean curry! Amazing. 
Their sticky rice is super fresh and on point as well if you love sticky rice as much as I do this place makes it by far the best! Their mango and sticky rice is also on point! Much more than other places!
My gf got the chicken katsu and it blows all these other places away!! Their regular rice is on point as well!! Everything is good here come try!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places ever. Food is excellent & always friendly service.  Macaroni salad is a must. Best pad wunsen in town!!"}
{"text":"We've eaten here multiple times and have zero complaints.  They don't deliver to our house, but we are happy to take the trip to pick it up.  Customer service is ALWAYS grade A.  The owner always goes the extra mile and makes us feel at home.  Then the food- 
I got the pineapple curry the first time and have gotten it every time since then.  So good. Rangoons are made fresh, as well as the egg rolls. The bf gets a different dish each time and loves every dish he has gotten so far.  We will splurge on Mango sticky rice every now and then, and it always hits the spot!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, and great hospitality! Locally owned an operated, with an extensive, but not overwhelming, menu. Tom Ka was delicious! I would definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Started going when they first opened and I worked at mountain view. Order delivery often and they always deliver on time. Rodney, the owner, is as friendly as they come. His wife, the chef behind all the yumminess is a genius with the blend of Hawaiian and Thai food."}
{"text":"I get dinner here about once a week. The owners are great and the food is delicious. I've enjoyed everything I've tried here and I always get a side of the volcano sauce because it's good on everything!"}
{"text":"Yum!!! Everything was great! The spring rolls are delicious and the fried chicken wings are too. The owner and his family are very friendly. Everything is made fresh to order. I got my noodles mild and they had just the right amount of heat for me, still kind of spicy but not too overwhelming. The drunken noodles are amazing. We will definitely be back here! Only down side is there isn't a whole lot of seating so you might want to take it to go. It might be hard to find because there is no sign on the outside of the building so keep your eyes peeled."}
{"text":"The people and place have a very special place in my heart. I miss this little restaurant that was once near my home in Wahiawa. Each time I find myself in Las Vegas I make it a point to say \"hello\" to family and eat their delicious food that is made with love.

Favorite dishes: Pork Belly w/ Chinese Broccoli, Green Curry w/ Chicken, Gai Tod (Fried Chicken), and Crab Rangoon.

Thank you Uncle Rodney and Aunty Thongmani!!!"}
{"text":"I have been craving coconut chicken soup which is called Tom Chi or something like that. I think I found this place on Yelp to begin with. This is a Hidden Gem a great mom and pop shop. It's Thai food with the love and styling of the Hawaiian Islands. A wonderful Fusion of both. It's located in the corner of a strip mall and it's almost kind of hard to find but once you get there you're going to love it. They have great spring rolls great super wonderful Curry and the people are super kind. Please support small business and check this place out."}
{"text":"Family owned Thai food at an affordable price. 

This restaurant offers your Thai favorites like curries, rad na, pad Thai, pad see ew, and a selection of other dishes. The family owns and operates this place, you will likely be seated by the owner's cute son. Then greeted by Rodney, who is a very friendly and kind man who would love to chat. 

I've had the beef jerkey which is well worth the 8 bucks they ask. Some places skimp on the beef. This place doesn't. The beef is tasty, chewy and plump. The dipping sauce is uniquely Plumeria: Salty, tangy, mildly spicy sauce with red onion and cilantro. 

I've had the pad Thai, which I was hesitant to try as most pad Thai in vegas is sickly sweet, gluggy, and overall mediocre. Now let me tell you. This did not disappoint!! I would highly recommend trying the pad Thai! I had it with chicken, which was tender. The noodles are perfectly prepared and have a little bite to them. The dish is topped with really fresh bean sprouts. A lime wedge and crushed peanuts are on the side for garnish. Flavor is on fleec. 

Lastly, I have had the Rad na. Beautiful fresh noodles, pan fried and topped with a wonderfully flavorful, tangy, tasty gravy with tender meat and Chinese Broccoli. 

Overall, The food is as good as it comes. It's not trying to be anything that it isn't. There's no fusion twist, no elaborate plating, nothing but tasty, home cooked Thai food. Did I mention the portions are plentiful? And the prices are under 10 bucks? 

The establishment is clean. There is no bathroom. This place is small. It's on Rainbow and Cheyenne. In the same lot as olive garden and IHOP and a gas station. I drove past this place a few times. It's all the way on one side of the strip mall, opposite side of the IHOP. 

Seriously if you're tired of Pin Kaow (does anyone still even go there?), or the Thai noodle house on Lake mead, give this place a shot. It will deliver on flavor and be easy on the wallet. Plus the guys here are very nice people. Even if you're not tired of your current spot. Get over to Plumeria. The family here deserves your business!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place!  Food is fresh and tastes wonderful. The staff are SO friendly and happy.  We came with another couple and we all liked our meals.  They also customize how spicy each dish is based on what each customer wants. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed this lovely quaint restaurant this evening for the first time.  The food was fantastic, especially the Tom Kha - what a burst of flavor!  Rodney the owner is very nice man and shares the credit of their great food with his wife. Definitely a new favorite."}
{"text":"Awesome food, friendly service, reasonable prices.  What more do you want? 

Got the Crab Rangoons and chicken katsu curry.  They were both excellent!  Get the Thai spicy if you like spicy, it's not extraordinarily hot, I feel it's just the right amount of heat."}
{"text":"Looking for somewhere new and we found a wonder placed tucked in the shopping center on Rainbow & Cheyenne.   Cook is the Auntie Phang (I think that was her name) and Uncle Rodney.   We will be back the flavors were spot on and wonderful find in a Friday Night!!   We had spring rolls. Tom Kha soup with red & white jasmine rice and Chicken Pad Thai!   It was really good and we will be back!!"}
{"text":"We are visiting from the 808 Hawaii and the food was excellent. Rodney the owner is very engaging, we tried the shrimp ragoon,Thai chow fun noodles with pork, belly pork red jasmine and for da Hawaii guys he brought out da mac salad. Just real good food with that home touch.

Aiea, Hawaii"}
{"text":"Wow! We came here based on Yelp reviews and I have the say, really worth it!! 
Small, quaint place, and the service is awesome!! Food was amazing and delicious! I can't wait to come back and try more from the menu! 
I had the Yellow Curry and it was fantastic!! Great Thai food with a Aloha twist!!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this establishment pretty regularly for about a year now. It is difficult for my family to eat out due to our dietary constraints, as both my wife and I are allergic to gluten. However, the owner has always been so conscientious of what he and his wife put into the food. He has done extensive research to ensure that he finds gluten free items such as soy sauce which is harder than you think. They are able to do an extensive amount of their menu gluten free. I absolutely love their pad Thai and herb chicken. It's so good I haven't want to try anything else but eventually I'll make my way through the menu!"}
{"text":"Made a second trip here with a friend, wasn't nearly as good as the first time. His was disappointing, mine was odd. And it took ages, as they were slammed with deliveries and UberEATS orders. 

Might get another visit, might not."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Plumerias ,it became my favorite as soon as I tasted what's now my favorite Tum Ka chicken soup Thai Spicy!! But what I love the most is the friendly service from The owner Rodney ."}
{"text":"It's no surprise this little place is so highly rated and recommended. The food was terrific, the ingredients were fresh and full of flavor. I loved how genuine and home style the place felt. It's very quaint and very mom and pop and be prepared for to go boxes and disposable eatery. The decor is Aloha friendly and the menu is packed with something for everyone. The owners were very accommodating. I will definitely order delivery and take out as dining in is very limited. Highly recommend you try this food any way you can get it!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and they deliver. Awesome if your up for Thai food and your being lazy. They deliver in a timely manner and the delivery person is very sweet."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely wonderful. You have to try the crab Rangoon's the pad Thai and the mango sticky rice. I am in a food coma so good."}
{"text":"Best Thai food since actually eating real Thai street food.  Very informal but with a real atmosphere of caring.  The food is wonderful. The chef learned at home growing up in Thailand and it shows both in quality and flavor.  Will continue to eat here as often as possible."}
{"text":"I placed an online order for beef fried rice. It was very very tasty. I am a bit of a snob when it comes to Thai food being that my parents are Thai and I've been to Thailand and grew up on it. I think it's one of the best fried rice I've ordered here in Vegas. Will definitely be trying more items from tier menu."}
{"text":"Plumeria Thai Cafe is the very definition of hole-in-the-wall, mom-and-pop goodness.

The owners and their kid are all very nice people, and the food is delicious. On my first visit, I had the slow-roasted pork ribs. The meat was extremely succulent, and the peanut sauce added a great flavor to the dish. So far I have tried approximately 8 items on their menu, and each has not disappointed.

They also have homemade beef jerky, though it might be redundant to say \"homemade\", since most everything is homemade here, which gives all the food a comforting, home-y vibe. My dad, my friends, and I all frequent Plumeria, and I would highly recommend this place to anyone who's looking for a bite to eat.

P.S. If you order the minced pork omelette, try getting peanut sauce on it!"}
{"text":"This is my second time visiting plumeria. My first visit was with my boyfriend and we were looking for nice local spots to eat having just moved into the area. We had a bit of trouble finding this gem because it's kind of hard to spot in the shopping center it's in. The inside is small but cute with Hawaiian flowers and is very clean. The dining room definitely couldn't seat more than 20 people but that's fine cause they do take out! My first visit I ordered the chicken katsu with curry and the crab rangoons while my boyfriend ordered the red peanut curry with Thai level spice (the hottest level) he found it to be deliciously spicy which is a huge plus because often he will ask for the hottest and find it to be still too mild. The flavor of the curry was delicious and blended with the spicy well. My own curry that paired with the katsu was much less spicy and far more peanut-y. It was delicious but not exactly what I was craving with my katsu but luckily they also serve it with a sweet chili sauce which is da bomb. My chicken was fried perfectly and still tender yet crispy. The crab rangoons were deliciously crabby and you could tell they were home made. During our visit the owner Rodney came and checked up on often while still executing take out orders on his blue tooth ear thing. He's a very efficient guy and super friendly. The cuisine theme here is Thai with a little 808 flavor. Rodney told us his family had lived in Hawaii for a while and started learning the cuisine and integrating it into their traditional dishes. The best part is that it's a mom and pop restaurant that is absolutely killing the game. Their food is delicious and prepared by his wife in the back every day, she's occasionally pop out of the kitchen and wipe down tables if theirs no tickets. they are friendly and attentive and the man makes his own jerky every week. You've got to try it. 
So after that we decided to take our whole family out to plumeria to celebrate my boyfriends birthday. 
We got the rangoons on my suggestion, delicious. 
-pineapple curry with shrimp and pork. Didn't taste this one myself but Adrianna said it was delicious.
-red curry Thai hot which was considered delicious by my spice loving boyfriend 
-pad wunsen which is glass noodles with vegetables and your choice of protein, I chose shrimp. Oh my god this dish. The shrimp were cooked perfectly and absolutely delicious. I don't usually order shrimp when I go out because I'm fearful of overcooked shrimp but these were perfect. The veggies were also nicely cooked with a good crunch to them in the right places. But the star of the show was the glass noodles. They had soaked up all the sauce making them a translucent light brown and you could taste it. I did medium heat which went perfect with the flavors. I can't overstate how delicious the pad wunsen is guys. Try the pad wunsen."}
{"text":"The food? Wonderful. The owners? Even better! 

You like Thai food? You dig Hawaiian grinds? This is your home now. The spirit of Aloha flows from this place like the lava from Kilauea. We're so looking forward to coming back soon for both the food and the conversation. Rodney is just awesome. 

Now that food, if you don't know what \"broke da mouth\" means before you eat here, you will after! There's a great mix of Thai and fusion Hawaiian on the menu. So many choices, so just pick one and go. Get the rest later! (Check in on Yelp for a Thai Iced Tea!) 

As mentioned previously, that Volcano Sauce is da bomb. I told my wife you could dump it on a dead frog and you'd be happy to eat it. Man, it's just a perfect mix of sweet, sour, and spicy (but not too spicy). It's too much for a light weight, but for most folks, I imagine it's just about right. (I can't speak for the spice levels of the food as we didn't order anything inherently spicy. From overheard conversations, I'd advise you to not overestimate your ability. 

The Peanut Sauce is great. 

I'd like to point out something interesting, a little extra effort to make everything a little special is their use of a mix of red and white jasmine rice. The attention to detail shows the amount of care with which their cuisine is prepared. 

Also, it may sound odd, but the Thai Tapioca dessert with corn and coconut milk is absolutely delightful. 

TL;DR -  Great family owned place with amazing food."}
{"text":"Great Thai food at a good price. The best part is the owner. He is extremely friendly and makes the experience special. Not very conducive to eating in, but not horrible. I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"First time here and what made me want to try this place was the oxtail soup- Thai style. Let me tell you, best Oxtail I ever had and I'm from Kauai! 
I also ordered side order of crab Rangoon and I usually don't like them because most places put more cream cheese than crab and doesn't taste good but this place makes it just right for me and the sauce is not just syrup, you can taste lil' pineapple chunks and it's nice and thick kind of sauce- gosh it's so good!
I definitely had to try their Mac salad- I've been in Vegas for 2.5 years and been to many Hawaiian restaurants here but this place, that Mac salad just brought me back home...omg! 
Last but not least I tried their Pad Thai. Sooooooooo good, perfect amount of spice, love the noodles, veggies- so good!
So overall, the food is ONO-LICIOUS (delicious).
The owner, is so aloha! He's a retired veteran and as soon as I walked in and talking story with him, I felt right at home. I ordered pick up but neva like leave! Next time I'm dining in. It's a hole in the wall place, cute lil' mom and pop dining place...I love it!
If you're in the mood for Hawaiian food with a lil' Thai flare- this is the place to go! Go check um, go check um, go! :)"}
{"text":"Just tried this new place and loved it.  I was surprised to find the owners recently came from Hawaii...like us. The food was very good and the price is low, so I'm happy. And Rodney and his wife were very nice folks.  She made this dessert...Thai layered cake...damn, that was delicious!

So I had pad see ew with tofu and my wife had Thai basil chicken.  Both dishes were delicious. We've been to several Thai paces in Vegas, and this one is my 2nd favorite so far, but since the other place is way on the other side of the Strip and Plumerias is just 2 minutes from home, I foresee us us eating here a lot."}
{"text":"Food is awesome!! Service is even better! I have certain food limitations and they ALWAYS accommodate me. They really are very special. I always get my food to go and there has never been a mistake. That is very rare on to-go orders:)

Food is still to die for. Service is awesome!!! Rodney, you and your wife wrote the book on Aloha my friend:)"}
{"text":"I had the yellow curry and the lemongrass soup, and the spices are on point! This place is DELICIOUS. Be aware that mild is spicy, hot is melt your face, and Thai hot... Well, you might catch fire. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Love this place. It's tucked away & tiny, but the food is delicious & the service was wonderful!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love the food here and the service is wonderful. The owners are the ones who help you and are super kind and caring. We moved offices right next door and I was so happy to be close by. Wonderful little place with amazing food!"}
{"text":"My co-worker ordered delivery one day, and after trying some of her fried rice, I had to go to the restaurant for dinner the next day! I love supporting family owned places, especially when they exceed expectations. The food is delicious: fresh vegetables, perfect amount of spicy, and not greasy like the usual Thai food places in the area. The wife cooks all food fresh to order, and always makes a special dessert for the day. I'm definitely becoming a regular and hope it does well here!"}
{"text":"Good mom and pop thai restaurant with very friendly service to boot! The owner is very friendly and can adjust dishes to your preference. I like it beyond extreme thai hot, and he accompanied that! Actually the first time when I came, and I had the same request, he said that he just made it a bit extra hot in fear that it would be too much, but since it didn't do anything for me, next time he would make it hotter. This time, he actually included two roasted ghost peppers on the side ;) super awesome"}
{"text":"Any local people looking for a taste of the 808 this is a must... Good food and choke Aloha."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic.  We had red curry and thai friend rice. The food was fresh and full of flavor. I want to go back just to try more things on the menu. The owner was so friendly and great service. All around it was a wonderful experience. I'm glad we decided to stop we will be back ."}
{"text":"This is an amazing small business with the best Thai food in town. In particular I'm a massive chili head and if you explain that to them they will make some of the spiciest Thai food ever. The pineapple Thai Fried rice is to die for , their Tom Yum soup is AMAZING, their curry make me smile every time, and they have the best pad Thai on the planet. They could easily charge 10 tines what they do based on quality alone. The owners are SO nice to boot. These people deserve success in this business."}
{"text":"Very decent thai food. They put a bit of a Hawaiian twist on some of their dishes. Not that many options in the area so comparatively to the rest of the neighborhood, it's worth going to if you're looking for convenience. No lunch special, but dishes are all around or a little over $10.  Owner is very friendly. Definitely worth trying!"}
{"text":"Excellent selection of Thai/Hawaiian fusion! The owners are both Hawaiian and Thai and recently moved from Hawaii to Vegas to take ownership of this gem! Super friendly, and the Thai food is just like my mother used to make (she's also Thai). I love having a Thai/Hawaiian place in the Northwest, and they are also super obliging when it comes to vegan/vegetarian options. They are able to make pretty much any dish vegan/vegetarian (including the 808 specials!) so definitely ask."}
{"text":"This was pretty good Thai food but nothing spectacular.  The customer service was amazing and that alone I would give five stars.  The owner and cooks are very gracious and welcoming.  The food is big portion sizes and the hot scale is true to hotness.  But nonetheless, just pretty good Thai food."}
{"text":"Very friendly family owned place. Hawaiian and Thai food on the menu. This will be our go to place when the kids want katsu. I can get some green curry."}
{"text":"Food was ok. It was definitely not the best or worst Thai food I have had. The portions are huge so that may be a plus for some. I personally would rather have a smaller portion but better tasting."}
{"text":"The chef got my order wrong. After telling him that what he made is not what I wanted, he demanded that I payed for it. I told him I'd pay for a new order but he said I still had to pay for the last one. Honestly, made no sense."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I can't comment on the food because there was a miscommunication and we never received it. 

We decided to use their delivery service which is done through a third party. After an hour and fifteen minutes we receive a phone call from the delivery company stating that there was a technical difficulty on the restaurants end and it would take another 45 minutes to receive our food. 

There was no apology, no phone call from the restaurant, not even the offer of reimbursement until I refused to wait another 45 minutes. 

We chose this place based on reviews and the delivery estimated time. My whole family was starving and that kind of service is unacceptable. 

I hope they sort this out"}
{"text":"Went in for our 3rd visit. I am addicted to the macaroni salad... Yummy . The pad keemao never disappoints. The volcano chicken is my older son's favorite and my 'vegetarian' son (6 years old) can't get enough of the chicken satay, the eggplant chicken was amazing. The papaya salad is so refreshing and delicious, down to the toasted peanuts. We order mild to share, I am the only spice eater in the family so I add their toasted Thai chili powder to my plate. The best!! I love to wash this all down with their perfectly made Thai iced tea. As always the hospitality is the best! We find ourselves craving this place often!"}
{"text":"Wow! I had the pork belly w/ Chinese broccoli. Flavor is amazing! Great quantity and quality for an affordable price. You gotta try that dish. Will be back to try others"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place. Walking through those doors, my kids and I were greeted by the sweetest, most patient man you could ever meet. Wondering what to order, as I was faced with such choices, he patiently described in detail many of their dishes. He even explained the heat level of the various curries to me. We decided to order several dishes to try it out. We had the chicken Katsu in peanut sauce, the chow fun (pad see ew), the banana and coconut spring rolls, shrimp rolls, and the pork belly with Chinese broccoli.  Every dish was loaded with flavor, my youngest stated the pad see ew was the best she'd ever tasted. The pork belly dish was full of garlic and perfectly prepared pork belly, offset with the crunchy bitter broccoli. The owner explained the process they use to cook the pork belly to the perfect texture, so that it's still chewy and crispy yet not greasy. The shrimp rolls were loved by my kids, but I didn't manage to try one myself. The banana and coconut spring rolls, were refreshingly sweet yet still firm inside the fried shell. All in all, the meal was amazing. I can't wait to try more. If you're any where close to this area, it's well worth trying."}
{"text":"Okay, another dinner night out.  Typical family run eatery that I'm used from SF, LA and Hawaii.  Very welcoming and family-style.  Great personal service from Rodney (owner) and his nephew Taylor serving us.  Best of all Pong (wife) who cooked it up.  
Okay, within the 30-40 minutes we asked a lot of questions and felt like familia.  Typical island-like friendliness and best of all how and why he cooked his pork belly the way he does.  Bottom-line if they can't eat it they won't serve it.  Now it's healthier than most Asian-like eateries and if it's off the so-called traditional way then it's because Rodney and Pong has their version or kick to it.  Open mind open palate you're in Vegas so I can accept the diversity.  I'm not in Cali anymore so if I want 100% traditional I'll stay home and cook but going outside it's an experience and Rodney I'll be back for sure.
I called this place the Vegas' Wing Lee version of SF Wing Lee (Jackson/Hyde) no longer around since 2015 but it was small holding only around 20 seats but it was around since late 1950's.  It became a landmark for cable car conductors and grips and the locals.  This place will be the local place for Vegas.  Your Chow Fun (Pad Siew) is on my list of the top five best Chow Fun ever.  Better than the typical Pad Siew sweet but not overpowering and spicy 5 was just at the point but I still taste the broccoli, beef and fun (noodle).  Texture was perfect: noodle and vegetables were not overcooked or soggy; thus, I knew you didn't have the either of them sitting in water all day prior to us ordering it.  Crunchy it was.
Chow fun was the test at my first round so next time it's your island cooking I'm going after.  Pretty sure you and Pong will kill it.  I feel the love in your cooking.
Thank you for the great experience."}
{"text":"Truly authentic Thai food. Not Americanized. But be warned, if you order it Thai spicy level you will get Thai spicy level and it will be hot. So don't whine and complain that it is too hot."}
{"text":"The best vegan thai food...  EVERYTHING IS EXCEPTIONAL!!!!!  my \"go-to\" place for thai food."}
{"text":"LOVE this place!!! Very accommodating to all diets including Vegan, the spring rolls are insanely addicting! Also I a HUGE spicy food fan and these people really know their spice!!!"}
{"text":"A family owned business with the best home cooked Thai food! The owner, a military vet, and his wife are originally from Hawaii. Their young son who helps out with taking orders and getting drinks has impeccable manners. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Thai / Hawaii mom & pop restaurant. A bit hidden (next to cash 1 on Cheyenne & Rainbow ).  Small with some tables. 

I had the chicken katsu with rice and Mac salad. Delicious. The rice is a bit on the bland side but the chicken and Mac salad were very tasty. 

Planning on coming back to explore other items on the menu."}
{"text":"If you're from Hawaii this is a must. We have been eating their Ono food since the Wahiawa days. Green Curry chicken katsu is my fav! Oh and don't forget the mac salad. If I could give 10 stars I would! Rodney and the gang are the best!"}
{"text":"Got the beef jerky which was very good, pad thai and pineapple fried rice, all were very good.  The only problem i had was the kid who was serving us.  He was too young and inexperienced.  When i was deciding what i wanted he kept asking me if i was ready, i said i need a couple min, then he would come back 1 min later and ask again.  When i asked his opinion on what was good and what ingredients were in certain dishes he was clueless and not helpful at all.  I had to ask his dad the owner, who answered my questions.  Both were very nice and polite though."}
{"text":"The pineapple friend rice with pork is amazing, and so is the porkbelly and Chinese broccoli. The mango sticky rice is among the best I have ever had. My girlfriend loves their hot wings."}
{"text":"So worth trying a new place because of their reviews. Every review was right on point. 

Support your local small businesses Yelpers because this one needs to stay open. 

Prior military (army vet owner) thank you sir!

Amazing Thai chai tea
Food was full of fresh flavor and they got the spice right on point. 
Will defiantly be back!!!!"}
{"text":"I got here 15 minutes before they opened but the owner welcomed me right in and was happy to tell me about their dishes. I ordered a pork belly dish with crab Rangoons, one of their most popular appetizers. The food was about a 4. 5 star, but, like I said, the owners are great. A solid 5 and that's something that lacks in even the nicest of places. 

I was the only costumer so I was able to talk with the owner over my meal. We talked about hunting and his experiences back in Hawaii. It was like visiting an old friend. I will be back while on my week long trip to the area."}
{"text":"Eating my first takeout order from Plumeria right now, and I am definitely going to be a repeat customer.  I tried the pork belly and chinese broccoli with a thai iced tea - great flavors and big portions.  Also, as other reviews have mentioned, the owners are incredibly friendly and welcoming.  Recommended for sure."}
{"text":"What a great find to have some real Thai food at. This little restuarant is very hidden in the northwest area of Vegas. This place seems to be family owned that shares all their family recipes to their customers. Me and my girlfriend ordered about four different entrees.

1.)Thai Herb Chicken Entr√©e.
2.)Pork Belly w/ broccoli.
3.)Green Papaya Salad.
4.)Shrimp rolls. (Definitely a must order) 

The items we ordered never disappointed me. All the meat entrees came with side of rice and Mac salad. The papaya salad was a lot for a very cheap price compare to others. The shrimp rolls were the best part Becuase of its unique style of being wrapped like a real fried spring roll. All in all the food and staff deserves two thumbs up. This place needs more recognition for its Authentic Thai/Hawaiin food. NO MSG !"}
{"text":"Simply the best Thai food in Las Vegas... Friendly service and home cooked meals, they do not skimp on the ingredients.. Fresh and good serving size. You can tell that they do not use low quality meats. Must try it.."}
{"text":"If you are looking for home cooked authentic Thai food this is your place! I'm all about Thai food so I tried many place in Vegas before coming across this place and now I will never go to any others!  I'm addicted to the food here and the hospitality of the husband and wife who run it! It's all around amazing  and if you order it Thai hot they actually make it Thai hot! The Thai basil chicken and yellow curry are my favorite and of course the fried rice is always a must! It's a very good place to order it Togo and enjoy at home also!!"}
{"text":"So hard to find good thai food but I did it! Excellent food and friendly people. Definitely be back."}
{"text":"Hands down some of the best Thai food I've ever had. This place is a staple in our house. You can't go wrong with the Hotter than Hell Basil Rice (Thai Hot) with a side of spicy fish oil."}
{"text":"I ordered Pas See-ew for pickup. I placed the order completely online, and it was ready within minutes of my arrival. The dish was tasty with just the right amount of spice. If you wanted to eat in, however, the place is quite small."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly, tasty and real Thai food.  The masterful Chiang Mai cook in the back and friendly team around her makes this a top spot in the Valley for Thai Food."}
{"text":"Beautiful foods with a really friendly and warm owners. I love this restaurant and the crazy desert they offer to try."}
{"text":"Found this hidden gem on YELP!  It's very different from the typical commercial Thai and Hawaiian flavors we're accustom to getting from other local spots..

The banana coconut spring rolls and sweet potato fries are amazing paired with this unique chocolate reduction.. we had shrimp fried rice and drunken noodles -- again amazing!  Shrimp was plump, juicy and fresh.. 

We will definitely return.."}
{"text":"Saw all the great reviews from Yelp and so my family and I tried this place.  And let me tell you it did not disappoint.  We love,love, love the foods we ordered.    I had the pork belly w/Chinese broccoli & it is so good!  My husband ordered the Thai herb fried chicken and he loved it! As we say in Hawaii, it was \"broke da mouth\" kind of food!!! My girls had the yummy beef pad Thai, the spicy volcano chicken and the refreshing Thai iced tea! They also loved it!  To top it off we had this awesome & delicious tapioca dessert, which I had to order as a take out to eat at home because my daughters loved it too! . 

The owner, Rodney, is nice and friendly!  It's a \"mom & pops\" type of restaurant.  Awesome service from the owner, his little son, & his amazing wife--the chef!  We will definitely return!  We enjoyed & loved the foods, the customer service, and the ambiance! Mahalo Rodney and family!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness!!! I came here because of the 5 stars on Yelp. I'm half Thai and haven't had real Thai food since I was a kid. After looking at the pictures I knew I needed to try this. It took me way back!  Comfort food for me. I got the Thai sticky noodles with chicken and mango sticky rice. Excellent!  This place is legit and the owner and staff are SO nice. Yes it's a little hole in the wall with about 4 tables inside, but you don't come here for the decor - you come for the bomb food and the kind and friendly mom and pop staff. This is my new place."}
{"text":"Excellent food from this small family owned restaurant in a strip mall.  We liked it so much, I'm getting ready to order takeout from there tonight."}
{"text":"Plumeria is a hidden gem! They don't have a sign above the establishment so it's not the easiest to find but not hard either. We ordered the hotter than hell thai spicy basil fried rice,  pineapple fried rice and panang curry. Everything was delectable,  the flavors were on point!  The owner is very attentive, helpful and funny. We also got the mango and sticky rice for dessert to top it all off and it was perfect.  We'll definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"The best Thai food I have had in a long time.  Small family place with great service.  The owner made us feel at home right away.   Just about everything on the menu can be made vegetarian or vegan since they make it all from scratch. Such bold flavors you won't miss the meat.  The sweet rice and mango was the best I have ever had and I have had a lot since I order it whenever I see it on the menu.  We will defiantly be coming."}
{"text":"Delish!!! Amazing food, very friendly service! Food was incredibly authentic. Spice level was perfection!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of a kind in las vegas. Its like thai/hawaiian restaurant. Its small but very clean and its a family owned business. The owner is very friendly, always smiling and loves what he does. We ordered oxtail soup(comes with 2 scoops of rice), volcano chicken and crab wonton. They all taste really good. They serve large portion so prepare to eat! Lol The price is not that expensive, for all three we paid only around $35. Dont be cheap, check them out and I guarantee you, you wont regret it."}
