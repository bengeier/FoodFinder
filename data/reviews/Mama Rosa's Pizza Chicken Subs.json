{"text":"Pretty darn good pizza.  More often then naught crust is fluffy and light    Hard to beat for the price.  If you like Italian subs try them.  Haven't tried the chicken n Jojo s yet that's next.  This has become a preferred take out place"}
{"text":"This was the worst pizza I have ever had. The cheese and sauce had both a sour taste and smell. The crust was bland and hard. The price was right at $3.99 so I gave it a try instead of going to a pizza franchise...but it was too horrible to eat."}
{"text":"Well I'll start with I ordered my food at 8 an he told me 50 minutes an it's now 9:35 an it jus got here! (Cold) The man was mean on the phone I should've knew then not to order! Anyway on top of that he didn't listen to me an forgot a meal!! An now they r closed so upset with everything! Oh an I called to see if my food was coming an he said all my drivers r out! No sorry we got really busy or anything! I will never go back! An I work in food severs! I also never do this cuz I feel so bad but jus want to give people a heads up!"}
{"text":"Wife loved the wings, I thought they were a bit under done, my preference being that they fried long enough to render out the fat in the skin so it isn't flabby so my vote would be 3 stars.
Had an antipasto salad that was ok but more notable for it's price rather than it's flavor or abundance.
A gyro sandwich on an earlier visit was just okay."}
