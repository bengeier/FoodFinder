{"text":"I personally really like this restaurant. Have been going here for over 10 years and its still one of my favourite chinese restaurants in Montreal. Their general tao chicken is really good!"}
{"text":"Je suis allée manger souvent a ce restaurant et c'est toujours très bon 
La nourriture est fraîche et les plats épicés juste correct 
Les portions sont très généreuses il en reste toujours 
Les menus genre table d'hôte sont bien choisis 
Souvent mon ami et moi nous choisissons 2 repas différents pour le partager 
Le service est correct moi je suis francophone et mon ami est anglophone et nous sommes servis dans nos langues respectives"}
{"text":"This place ranks on par with the takeout places behind bulletproof glass in parts of the Bronx. Food is over cooked and heavy, service incompetent, and no ambiance. Pick somewhere else... you'll thank me."}
{"text":"My folks come here regularly and love this place, so they took me here for dinner recently - and I must say, I loved it, too! Sure, it's not fancy, and it's not \"authentic\" Chinese food, and it's a bit worn around the edges (the finishes on the flooring and chairs are older and worn, the aesthetic's a bit drab). But it was clean and the food was good. It reminded me of the Canadianized/Americanized Chinese food of my youth, when you could get a humongous meal for $10 or so and have plenty of left-overs for the next few days. 

I had the honey and garlic spareribs. These are to die for! Sweet, like candy, and so soft, fall-off-the-bone. (I'm sure there are a gazillion calories in this dish, but I choose not to think about that right now. LOL). My mother always has the peanut butter dumplings which she adores! (I tried one and it was very good but not my thing). Dad always gets the salt and pepper shrimp (delicious!). We started our meal with spring rolls which were fantastic. We shared the vegetable fried rice (always good!).

Did I mention that we had left-overs for a few days? (Bonus!).

Another reviewer noted that the bathrooms weren't so clean, but the one I went to was. Not large or fancy in any way, but clean and serviceable.

Our server was Matthew and he was attentive and friendly. We chatted with Kevin afterwards (I think he is the owner or manager): young, hip guy who is SUPER nice. It was great chatting with him! (He sure knows Vancouver, where I'm now living, and the restaurant scene there). 

I plan to take my kids here when we visit in the summer, so they can experience casual Chinese food from my youth (!)."}
{"text":"What a shame! Staff are disrespectful!!! Did not commit on usual delivery time and they have the audacity to ask if client wants the food or not??? Will never go back here and will definitely spread the news, specially to the people around CSL!"}
{"text":"Ooh, this was just bad. Everything I tried had a gloppy sauce or was overly salty."}
{"text":"Yesterday afternoon I picked up peanut butter dumplings from this restaurant.  An hour after eating the dumplings I started to feel cold and shaky.  I went to bed, under my covers feeling horrible.  My body started to ache and I began to experience severe nausea, diarrhea and headache.  I could not move out of bed for fear of passing out.  Could not sleep all night.  Around 2:00 a.m., feeling like death, I got up to get some air.  5 minutes later I threw up these disgusting dumplings.  I then started to feel a bit better.  I will never go back again to this horrible place.  I hope that no one has to go through such a horrible night from food poisoning."}
{"text":"Consistently mediocre. Posting a picture of crispy noodles with tofu and black bean sauce.  I ordered this a few days ago and it had no flavor. When I ordered it again (it's around the corner from my mother) I said, LOTS OF BLACK BEAN SAUCE. Take a look."}
{"text":"My mom and I have been here twice. Both times the food was served hot and quickly by kind and courteous wait staff. The portions are huge and there were left overs both times. We loved everything we ate and will be back soon! Only negative is the bathroom, very compact and not overly clean."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night after a tireless search of restaurants in our neighbourhood. Danny was intent on having Chinese, and so we finally found this place and decided to give it a try. We walked in and although it was pretty small (10-12 tables max) and packed, we were seated right away. We figured since it was packed it was a good sign that the food was pretty good. We ordered the Beef and Chinese broccoli fried noodles, chicken fried rice and pepper chicken with crispy spinach. It took quite awhile to get our food, while others who had arrived after us received their food first. Once we finally received our food, we noticed the fried noodles had regular broccoli and not chinese broccoli (a little oversight, but not a deal breaker). The noodles were decent, not OMG amazing, but not terrible. The fried rice was lacking a lot of salt, so we were forced to douse it in soy sauce. I would say the best dish was the pepper chicken with crispy spinach. We've had this dish at other places, and the sauce is always rather sweet as opposed to pepper-y. The sauce was pretty good and paired well with the chicken and crispy spinach. Overall, in a pinch (read: when you're really craving Chinese) in or around the Cote-St-Luc area, it'll do. But I wouldn't go out of my way to come here unfortunately."}
