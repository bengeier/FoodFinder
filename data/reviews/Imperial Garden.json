{"text":"Came here for a friend's wedding reception, marking my first time here in the 5 years in Madison. My department holds its yearly reception here, so I've always been curious how it is like. On the other hand I have heard it's an American-Asian food place, which explains my hesitance to try it out. So the wedding reception was a great opportunity.

I would say all my friends were right. Imperial Garden is a mix between authentic chinese food and american chinese food. The peking duck and the appetizer platter were my favorite. The appetizer platter (serves 4) consisted of Egg rolls, grilled pot stickers, bbq pork, crispy shrimp and calamari. Pot stickers were nicely made and flavorful, calamari is also crispy *yums* Shrimps are lightly breaded and very tasty, could taste how fresh they are. 

The Peking Duck is also super awesome. Note that you have to order the duck a day in advance. It's a whole duck specially prepared and served in three courses, of which the crispy duck skin with mandarin pancakes is my favorite. Super authentic! You can ask for more pancakes with the dish, yes it is this good! 

Other dishes we tried include the usual general tso chicken, mongolian pork, stir fry noodles. Those are delicious, but in my opinion those are pretty common in chinese restaurants. I would recommend Imperial Garden for special occasions (the restaurant is roomy and nice to accommodate large groups). Order their specialty dishes, they are worth it."}
{"text":"We have been visiting Imperial Garden for over 30 years and have always found it to have the best Chinese food in Madison, or regionally for that matter.  The Midwest remains pretty much a wasteland in the Chinese food category.  Imperial was always our oasis.  However, lately they have fallen out of bed.  On both occasions that we have been there within the last six months, the food has lost its character and flavor.  Also, on both occasions our food was served barely warm, so it had been sitting around awhile before it ever got to us.  Disappointing.

Giving Imperial Garden three stars would be overly generous at this point, as the food really was disappointing, and was definitely not A-OK.  We usually order way more than we can eat and take away the rest for reheating at home another day.  In this case even the leftovers, which I always enjoy almost as much as the first time around, were pretty dismal.  I won't get into the details of which dishes, but across the board that we have sampled, it appears that the chef has changed, and not for the better."}
{"text":"Never had Chinese food this bad. Very bland, came out 3 minutes after we ordered and it was warm which makes me think it was sitting in a pot all day."}
{"text":"This was, quite possibly, the WORST Chinese food (if you can call it that) that I've ever eaten in my life.

We started with the appetizer platter for two.  The calamari was so stringy that I had to swallow it in one bite because I couldn't separate it with my teeth.  The egg rolls were at least crispy and well-rolled, but they had absolutely no seasoning other than a tad too much salt.  The shrimp were overcooked, the barbecue pork was dry, and the hot dumplings were cold and under seasoned.

Then came the entrees.  I ordered Imperial Chicken, thinking that being the restaurant's namesake, it had to be good.  I was wrong.  The breading was mushy, the chicken was dry, and the sauce was basically  sweet and sour sauce with added hoisan, and several dried peppers that were burnt so badly they added an unintentional, overdone smoky flavor.

My boyfriend ordered the Ma-po Tofu.  He loves spicy food, and this was just a little spicy, but the spice overpowered all the other flavors in the dish (besides the scallions).  The tofu was a good texture, but the unbalanced sauce flavors basically rendered it inedible.

Apart from the horrendous food was the tepid service.  I had to ask several times for a glass of water.  The waitress came by with the water pitcher and had just enough to fill my glass up halfway, so she returned to the kitchen for a refill and stopped by to fill my boyfriend's glass.  By this time, I drank my half glass of water - and she didn't even bother to top mine off.  I tried to ask for some, but she walked away.  

Plus, I thought it was supposed to be an authentic Chinese food restaurant - what's with the Vivaldi and Mozart soundtrack?

Skip this place all together and hit up the Asian grocery and gas station next door.  On Fridays, they receive shipments of Pork Bao in from a bakery in Chicago that are to die for!"}
{"text":"I live on the east side of Madison and I always eat at the Imperial Gardens near E. Washington and this Imperial was a let down. The restaurant itself is beautiful and the decor is lovely but the food and staff wasn't as amazing as I hoped for. 

For starters, the food is so expensive compared to the east side and the plates are larger but the portions are definitely not bigger. Our chicken sizzling rice soup was flavor less and completely watered down. My friend loves oyster beef but what received tasted completely different and it had a weird sort of sour after taste. I had the pepper steak and I did like how the onions and peppers are more thinly sliced but my meat also had a strange after taste.

The staff was very kind but a little annoying. It's was great at first to see how attentive they were to our needs but the waitress came to us almost every 10min and made awkward small talk which really bothered us. We could then see her staring at us from across the room waiting to start another unwanted conversation.

Imperial Garden Middleton will definitely be memorable but, for all the wrong reasons."}
{"text":"How do you get voted best of for 31 years when what is served is awful? This is the worst Chinese food my entire family has had in years. We all ordered different things and none of us could eat our meals. That was $50 wasted. There was no flavor, or the flavor there was did not match the dish. How do you mess up beef fried rice? I can make it with more flavor. The Mongolian beef had a flavor but it was all wrong. If you want to waste money and still be hungry, this is the place for you. How do places keep getting good reviews when they are so bad. I use to trust Yelp reviews but lately, I've been fooled by the reviews."}
{"text":"I've certainly dined at this restaurant more than 100 times in the last 10 years if you count take out.   They've got an extensive menu and there are a bunch of things on it that I really like.  That being said, I've probably only had a dozen of the menu items because I tend to revisit my favorites.  I think I'm fairly picky about food and service as there are a bunch of local restaurants I've tried that I won't go back to.

The service is consistently good, the wait staff seems better trained than at most places.  The manager always recognizes and greets us which is nice.

My favorite menu item is the Three Delicacies Sizzling Fried Rice.  It has shrimp, scallops, and chicken  in a clear broth with vegetables.  It is poured on a hot skillet tableside.     They have other versions of this dish with just chicken or shrimp but I like the combination.

Now I suppose this is Americanized Chinese food but then I'm not Chinese and haven't been to China so I wouldn't know for certain.  It has occurred to me that I might well prefer Imperial Garden to the \"authentic\" Chinese food."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in the area. Great service and calming atmosphere."}
{"text":"I was in town visiting family and someone suggested IG. When I drove up to it, it brought back yummy memories. It's been years since I ate there. I am glad we went there for dinner. We ate governors chicken, governors beef, sweet and sour chicken, peppered beef and beef chow fun. Everyone ate their plates! Service was slow that night but the food made up for it!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in Madison. Orange beef is great. Can be crazy at peak hours. Capacity of the place is high, but the front of the house and back get overwhelmed. The gas station next-door must be affiliated because you can buy chinese food items there too. Like BBQ pork etc."}
{"text":"So I had heard from a couple of people that this was the best Chinese (American/Chinese) in town. That is not true at all! I tried a sampling appetizer, dumpling, sweet and sour chicken, among other things and there was simply no flavor nor originality. The decor of the place is nice, that must be what people are mesmerized with, so much so they forget to pay attention to the screams of agony from their tongue! I do not recommend this place.

A good note is the waitress was great and the decor is fun but that's is not what I go out to eat for..."}
{"text":"The food usually is pretty good but if you get take out, you better watch out! I used to be a nearly weekly take out customer, but over the last several months, probably 1/3 of my orders have been incorrect when ordering more the two things. Mostly it's missing pieces of the order, often a full entree is forgotten but of course these items are NEVER forgotten from your bill. 
Calling back to say the order you received is incorrect is usually not met with the apologetic, 'how can we fix this' attitude however. The staff have seemed somewhat annoyed with a simple request to refund the order left out or huffy about making the missing item for to pick up -- again. 
I always double check my take out orders now before leaving, and the staff seems annoyed I'm taking up counter space to dig through the often already leaking big. 
I received no 'thank you' on a recent pick up, despite my repeated verbal gratitude, but our most recent, and likely final, take out order was an extra large mess up. I generally order the same entree for myself (chicken fried rice, extra spicy) and used to order this nearly weekly. As I was eating my order, I though things seemed a little off, then realized instead of chicken, I was given shrimp. I'm allergic to seafood!
When we called to complain, we actually had to ask for a refund. The manager was apologetic, and I understand that sometimes mistakes happen, but imperial gardens mistakes are to frequent to allow for enjoyable and confident take out."}
{"text":"This used to have really well seasoned dishes with a variety of delicate flavors.  But the last few years has led to uneven dishes, and sauces that have no subtlety or are just plain greasy with little flavor.  They've also stopped paying attention to special requests.  In my last two orders from IG about a month apart, I asked them to omit a vegetable ingredient from a dish.  Both times they forgot.  The first time they argued with me about it, and the second time they admitted their error and refunded the price of the dishes on our credit card. But I ended up having to heat up a microwave meal out of the freezer both times!!  So now I'm done with IG and have to find another Chinese restaurant that cares about the taste of their food and the ingredients."}
{"text":"Always consistently delicious! Classic preparations of Americanized Chinese. The cashew chicken is great!"}
{"text":"It's perhaps the closest you can get to authetic Chinese food in a place like Madison, particularly after China Palace closed. The food is alright, it's been embellished in a way to appeal to an American audience, but at least the some of the menu choices are pretty real. 

My real problem with this place is the service: The menu was misinforming and didn't specify that some steamed fish dish was a filet as opposed to a whole fish. I politely complained to the waitress about my order not being accurate and she informed her manager. The manager only ended up refunding me 50% off the item ordered and began telling me how you wouldn't refund someone a fancy steak in an expensive restaurant!

In the end, I paid for my meal and tipped the poor waitress, but I will never visit this place again. I'm not sure if that manager woman was giving me a hard time because I was a young college student or what, but her management skills leave much to be desired."}
{"text":"Best chinese is Madison by far, but very expensive! You do always get great service though. Yum!"}
{"text":"Thoroughly mediocre Chinese food. Could have gotten the same thing from a random mall food court."}
{"text":"Authentic good quality food in an old style Chinese restaurant setting.  Very satisfied overall with my first visit.  Second visit included my six year old which was not so good, they don't even have crayons for a child."}
{"text":"Just fair, but you learn to appreciate decent chinese food for its rarity (I know, a strange concept for those of us living in the Bay Area)."}
{"text":"Lettuce wraps 3x better than PF Changs. If Yelp reviewers consider PF changs 3 stars, then this gets 5.

Just to clear up for those who want authentic Chinese. Go to ICHIBAN NOW!!!"}
{"text":"Imperial Garden has been around a long time and seems to be a local favorite. That struck me as a very bad sign when I came to Madison almost 20 years ago, and that continues to be the case. The food is insipid, blandly spiced to appeal to unadventurous midwestern tastes and with a menu reminiscent of the Americanized Chinese palaces of the 1950s. I end up there with various groups on occasion, but try to keep it to no more frequent than once every five years (more frequently in my first years in Madison, less so now). It's not that there are vastly superior authentic Chinese options (although I prefer P. F. Chang's, recognizing its limitations), but one does better with other Asian options when in Madison--particularly Thai/Laotian, but also Indian (with many new options in recent years)."}
{"text":"I literally just walked out of the establishment. I was willing to give it a shot. The moment I walked in, I was not greeted, so that was the first red flag, they basically looked at me like \"what can we do for you\" I had to basically say the first word and said it's just me. Second the place was somewhat full so I expected that they may not have a table, the hostess didn't catch her name but she look to me like she's foreign like Sri Lanka or India. She grabbed a menu and just started walking towards the dining area, I requested a booth she said there's non available and before I can point at a table which would of been perfect instead she was out of my sight and was in another section of the restaurant with just the tables... I noticed she tried to put me crammed in the back next to some random group of over weight woman. Plus the table was next to a window with the sun glaring through it. I then asked her politely if I can just sit at the main dining area even though it's a table for 4, I get it that they may want to save that in case a bigger family shows up but I fought it because the close Lunch at 2pm and this happened around 1:15pm and they still had plenty of bigger tables available. The way she responded when I asked her if I can sit some where else is the main reason I walked out. She was hesitant to give me a straight up answer. she said ummm not really! Are you serious, if a guest of your restaurant request a certain dining seating you do it if it's available. Too bad I didn't get to try their food, I'm sure it would of been great. To the owner of the Restaurant please discipline this individual and have her clean dishes rather than be a hostess. She needs more training in customer service. Maybe I may try out the restaurant with a date next time but for now, I'll just try this other restaurant that serves Dim Sum."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting much, I have to admit. But every single item we ordered was really good. Better than I expected. Our service was good - the place was busy on a Saturday night - so maybe we didn't get as much attention as we would have liked (drink refills, etc). But I have to say the food was worth it, and the 'imperial garden' ambience of classic American based Chinese food made this much more of a grand experience than the hole in the wall places I'm used to in bigger cities!"}
{"text":"Took four kids tonight and we were all underwhelmed. The chicken egg drop soup was oddly sweet. We got a barbecue pork dish and some beef dish that both had a bland gravy. A huge platter of pot stickers that got everyone excited but ended up being ... bland. Even the dipping sauce just tasted like soy sauce. The calamari was not tough. I'll give them that. If this is the best Chinese food around... I'm sorry."}
{"text":"Initial greeting and continued wait staff service were excellent, especially for a Friday night.  Food is always good making them a madison tradition. Fragrant shrimp is super."}
{"text":"Our group tried the Imperial Garden for dinner this week.  It's a large space with multiple rooms.  They had a lazy Susan on our table so it was easy to pass sauces and dishes to share.

Our server was friendly and prompt.  She made suggestions on our orders and explained the different sauces.  She and the rest of the wait staff were good about refilling our water and beverages and checking up on us.

I thought the grilled dumplings were excellent.  I enjoyed my lamb which was very tender and had good flavor.  I tried a couple of different shrimp dishes, one with a creamy garlicky sauce, and one with a sauce which was too sweet for my taste.  Our group also had a variety of other beef and chicken dishes.  Although not all of the flavors were to my taste, I would say this was one of the best Chinese restaurants we've been to in the area.  I thought the prices were reasonable, the portions fine, and most of the flavors and textures quite good.  The service was very good.

If I was in the area and wanted Chinese, I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I stop in here a few times of year, they are always busy, and they have been named 'Best in Madison' many years in a row.  

I don't think I have ever had a bad experience here, although my visit on April 1 was borderline. The food arrived timely, and for six different lunch menu items, I was impressed.  The ginger beef was fragrant, just enough punch, and portion size was reasonable.  

The only complaint I have was getting our beverages refilled. They have such tiny water glasses and after about the fourth trip to the table, they finally dropped off a pitcher of water.  Not until they brought the check did they offer to refill any sodas.  I thought it was tacky to ask at this point since the glasses had been empty for at least half an hour.  

Overall, prompt service (if you know me, I really hate to wait), good portion size, tasty food... I'll be back"}
{"text":"sorry to say but both the food and service are not good. not very welcoming/nice overall. the imperial chicken was very soggy and tasted a bit uncooked, the ingredients don't seem very fresh, the portions overall are small for the prices. tea doesn't come with a tea strainer inside and all the leaves poured out as i drank from my cup. i had to ask a busser for a separate manual tea strainer! (they charge per cup, by the way per person).. help and service are so slow and every single time i asked for something, the waitress sternly told me to wait or hold on a second after she finished serving others first

very americanized Chinese food, not so authentic, on the salty side
oh and the crispy noodles are like those things you get for free when you order chinese take out/delivery (like those fried wonton chips!) - they said that that's all they have for the crispy noodles, so i don't recommend getting the chow mien crispy noodle dish because they're not like real noodles after all :/"}
{"text":"We are a family of 4, love Chinese food, so decided to this place a whirl on a Sat eve at 8 pm. 
Service was very poor, the minute we stepped in. The hostess told us there was a wait but couldn't tell us how long \"I don't know\"! She kept us waiting for 20 mins  and then took us in. We would've gladly waited longer if we were given an approximate wait time. 
Even after we were seated, we felt largely ignored. The restaurant had several empty tables. 
The food was absolutely mediocre. We ordered pot stickers for appetizer, Governors pork, chicken with vegetables, steamed Chinese broccoli, pan fried Noodles with chicken and brown rice. 
Except for the Governor's pork which we highly recommend, everything else was ho-hum, bland and forgettable. Wouldn't be returning!!"}
{"text":"Yum!  Party of 7, everyone ordered their own dish and then shared with all.  Started with pot stickers and shrimp ragoon.  Grilled pot stickers were really good, could have just eaten those and been happy.  Appetizers came with a variety of dipping sauces.  Best dishes sampled were crispy orange beef, almond chicken and generals lamb.  Lamb was way tender, excellent choice.  Service was prompt and friendly, great atmosphere.  Ended meal with delicious mango ice cream.  Left happy and very full!"}
{"text":"Having always driven by this place and seeing how during some evenings the parking lot is full, my daughter and I decided to celebrate her birthday here. As we were walking in, I jokingly told my daughter, \"Watch they put us way back in some corner, away from everyone else.\" Lo and behold, we were! I'm not sure if it was coincidence or the way we looked (dressed pretty casual..maybe it was \"us\").
We waited about 10 minutes for our waiter and water to come. Then another 5 to order. We were pressed for time, having another appointment to go to. I thought budgeting a time of 1 hr would be enough, but not at that pace!
Our food, a dish of chow fun subgum and shrimp fried rice, took about 15 minutes to be served. The chow fun noodles looked like they had been sitting out for a while and were starting to congeal. There were little strips of carrots in the dish, something I've never had with this dish before. I was expecting something like stir-fried chinese broccoli. Skimping on veggies aren't we?! The shrimp fried rice was the better tasting dish. Plenty of shrimp and so-so flavor. Both dishes came to a total around $22.
I kept on saying to my daughter, \"You know, this other restaurant (which is only carryout) is so much better than this.\"  I think I repeated it three times to her throughout our meal. 
By the time we were done, I quickly told the waiter we simply had to go somewhere else and needed the check asap and boxes for our food. He was prompt and delivered. 
I asked my daughter how many stars she would give. She said 3 1/2 because the restaurant was decorated nicely and the furniture was comfy. I still say 2 stars for food though cuz there's this one place (which is carryout only) that is so much better."}
{"text":"Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.

I went there a second time because I couldn't remember if I liked the food or not (yes,it was THAT unremarkable). Upon going there the second time, I knew there would not be a third. Ever. 

I know this is Madison, but c'mon, I've had more authentic Chinese food at Panda Express. What should have been an immediate tip-off was the fact that there weren't any chinese words on the menu...and that all the clientele was white (again, yes I know this is Madison, but this is compared to other Chinese restaurants like Fugu or Ichiban). I don't actually remember the specific dishes I ordered (I've had fish, chicken, pork, and beef there), but it all just tasted as if it had been sitting in the freezer for months. Dry and flavorless. 

The service was also slow. They refilled our glasses only once, after we had asked for the check.

I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Just an update to say they don't even have the #1 spot anymore as that goes pretty easily to Ichiban on park.  Still, better than most in town."}
{"text":"Decent food, slightly more expensive than their competitors, and more legit varieties on their menu.

I'll give credit to Imperial Garden's decor as it is significantly more eye-pleasing than other Asian restaurants and the fact that they have a full bar. 

I give kudos to this place because they're the only Chinese restaurant in the area that offers peking duck, a true Chinese specialty. Their seafood selection is also pretty upstanding and are cooked well. I'm also a fan of their \"banquet\" specials, which is for when you go in groups and they offer you a selection of X many dishes to share for a set price per person (this is available for lunch and dinner I believe, though I've never been here for lunch). 

Aside from the aforementioned pros of Imperial Garden, the other dishes on their menu (if you order without doing the \"banquet\") is average-tasting at best and overpriced."}
{"text":"I really like their cashew chicken and grilled pot stickers! The ambiance is nice and the staff was attentive. Prices, portions, and quality were good. Overall it was a fine experience. Nothing exceptional, nothing bad."}
{"text":"I went to this place yesterday.  I had reserved 3 course Peking duck.  My family is 3 people.  The duck dishes were really good.  Not over spiced and greesy.  Apparently menu says it is for 2 people, but we boxed almost half of the third course duck dish.

The service was fantastic.  I think by far this is the best chinese restaurant overall."}
{"text":"I think good Chinese food is hard to find, and this is the best in Madison. If there is a better place, I would like to know. I just had the Governor's Chicken. I asked for all white meat and got it. The chicken fried rice was good too.

There was a lot of food in the dinner portions, so it made for great leftovers the next day. I did carryout, and it was ready when promised.

Mark me as a satisfied customer."}
{"text":"Dining at Imperial Garden was an exciting Chinese cuisine experience. I wasn't sure what to expect upon entering, but it was definitely a grand entrance. I was delighted to be dining in a finer atmosphere than your average Chinese Buffet. Yes, the décor might be slightly outdated, but it's truly a nice, traditional ambiance. Service was good and our server was very friendly with years of knowledge on the menu and the restaurant. 

We ordered Egg Rolls and Shrimp Rangoon for appetizers. The egg rolls were fresh, full, and crunchy. I'm a picky egg roll gal and these would have been perfect if the crunchy part was a little thicker. Nevertheless, I'd give these rolls an 8/10. Our server praised the Shrimp Rangoon and it was a wonderful alternative to the standard Crab Rangoon. Dinner went just as well with Crispy Scallops and Fragrant Shrimp which came with white rice. The portion sizes for both dishes were plenty. The scallops were full of flavor with a panko-like crust and even more savory after squeezing fresh lemon. The Fragrant Shrimp was lacking the spice that was in parenthesis next to its name on the menu, but it was still a flavored packed plate with green peppers, onions, water chestnuts, mushrooms, and carrots. Overall, the food, service, and ambiance was good.

I just wish they were open for lunch hours on Saturday and Sunday."}
{"text":"Imperial garden is imperial!  The food is very good and service is professional. 
I love the white table clothes and napkins. Makes me feel special and yet casual dressing is acceptable. 
I had a chicken egg roll that was very good although i really prefer the vegetable. I had sweet and sour shrimp. Best I've had in a long time!!  The portion was large and had many pieces of pineapple, onion, cherries, green pepper and tomato!!! Your lucky if you get one little piece of each at most places. 
My friend had combination chop suey. It looked delicious. Chuck full of meat and vegetables. Very large portion. 
They were busy but we were seated right away in a comfortable roomy booth. 
Their prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"The short of the story is - we went here yesterday (Mother's Day) and were there 3 hours! Waited a full 2 hours for our food. So if you have don't mind waiting an unbelievable amount of time for food and have all day to waste, then read on. . .

For years I have drove by the Imperial Garden and referred to it as the \"Chinese Restaurant Gas Station\". I don't even know if they are connected or what, but you see them both as you turn the corner. We decided to go to this place for Mother's Day and check it out. Talking to friends over the weekend, we were told it was pretty good.

The building is nice and the atmosphere of the restaurant was way nicer than I expected. Very large and nicely decorated. Not so cheesy like a lot of Chinese-American places in Wisconsin. The hostess greeted us very nicely and having reservations we were seated right away. 

Now - we were a larger than average group - table of 8 - but they clearly were set up for groups this big as they had large tables in the corner of the rooms with a spinning lazy susan in the middle that was perfect for us. I think we probably could have even gotten 9 or 10 people on this table. The waitress was very nice too. Came right away and got us drinks and very friendly.

This is when things went down hill. We did order appetizers, which came out right away. Pot Stickers - both steamed and fried - which were pretty good. Once our whole group arrived we all ordered regular items from their menu. Then we waited. Waited and waited and waited. Apparently so did everyone around us. For hours - over two to be exact. The waitress did her best - kept coming by and telling us she was sorry, that the Kitchen was crazy and that we were next. Honestly we should have left - but it was hard enough getting family members from 4 households together at one time. 

Eventually the food came out. To their credit, I thought everything tasted pretty good. I got two different shrimp dishes. Decent flavor, cooked perfectly - the snap peas and water chestnuts were good. Portion was decent on the Shrimp dinner and much larger on the chicken dinners that others in my group got. I agree with other reviews - its not the most adventurous food. Flavors were safe and my spicy shrimp wasn't very spicy at all. My sister-in-law was upset her Sesame Chicken with Broccoli came with one piece of broccoli. She complained and the waitress brought out a side of broccoli.

Overall, If the food wasn't pretty good - I would have given this place one star. I give our waitress credit for holding it together too. She offered free desert but we were about an hour late for getting to another place so had to go. Saddest thing is we heard that this has been an ongoing problem with the Kitchen. Sounds like they don't fire dishes in the order they come in and they have a lot of trouble keeping up with things. If they could correct this problem and add a bit more flavor into a few dishes, the place really could be ok.

Try it on your own risk - but I would plan on spending several long hours while you wait for your food."}
{"text":"Grilled potstickers, moo shu pork, cashew chicken. Yum!!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Chinese food in Madison. The chicken chow mein has been a favorite since I was a child. Try the egg rolls and the jasmine or chrysanthemum tea. You really can never go wrong here! The decor is beautiful, and makes you almost feel like you could be in a restaurant in China."}
{"text":"Chinese food from your parents generation and service that would make a tortoise look like a rabbit this place is unbelievably typically rated the best Chinese food in Madison. Madison obviously is ok with what these guys are serving.  One sign of an authentic ethnic restaurant is the number of people of that culture eating there. Well the China Garden must be a damn good Wisconsin supper club based on the clientele.  That said, the fragrant chicken is good as is the orange beef."}
{"text":"I'm a little confused. 

After driving by Imperial Garden, and time after time seeing a packed parking lot, I finally tried the place. It's basically the typical Americanized, overpriced sit-down Chinese restaurant. Why so many cars and why so many people eating there? I'm not sure.

The BBQ pork in our appetizer was almost cold and chewy. (Was it supposed to be jerky?) Other items on the appetizer platter were okay, but lacked seasoning.

Our entrees weren't much better. The sweet-and-sour sauce was more like sweet-and-strange sauce. The very odd thing about the sauce was that it was too sweet. (And I'm someone with a sweet tooth and then some!) The sauce seemed sort of like a red version of corn syrup. Just very weird.

The sweet-and-sour chicken entree came with the usual -- chicken, peppers, onions, pineapples -- and maraschino cherries. I only want to see and see those with a milkshake. As part of a dinner entree? No, no.

I am still scratching my head as to why this place has a full parking lot and why it has won some of the \"Best of Madison\" awards.

PS: Our server was nice!"}
{"text":"I wanted to have peeking duck. I had heard of it for many years but have never eaten yet. I chose this Imperial Garden to try it. It required a one day notice in advance to order it. I am very satisfied with its flavor. I had the three-course version which included duck being served in three different ways. It was very tasty.The service and atmosphere was very nice. It was relaxing and enjoyable."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful.  One, Almost anything on the menu can be made gluten free.  Two, They have about 7 different types of loose teas to choose from.  Three, The food is GREAT!

My favorite dishes are the Three Delicacies Sizzling Rice Soup and  the Tofu Lettuce Wraps.  I am not lying when I say that I have NEVER had a dish I didn't like here.  The food is never greasy, never oversauced and never overcooked.  The seafood and veggies always have a really fresh taste... I seriously have no complaints at all.

I miss you."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since the 80s and never miss a chance to eat here every time I'm in Madison. I love the food here and my family does as well. My favorites are the pan fried dumpling appetizer and for entrees the Governor's shrimp is the best. My sis always orders the Fragrant beef and loves it. Sometimes service is a little slow but only because the place is always full. The won ton soup and vegetable fried rice are very good as well. I wish I knew of a Chinese restaurant as beautiful and clean as this in the Boca Raton area! Can't seam to find anything to compare!"}
{"text":"Wow I'm surprised I hadn't yet reviewed this place. I decided to go here Valentines day with my better half and boy what a treat it was again. We ordered some appetizers, I had the Chicken Egg Roll and we shared an order of the Grilled Pot Stickers. Both were great ways to start off our meals. 

Fast forward to entree time and she had the Three Delicacies Sizzling Rice, which was pure fantastic and a huge quantity. I ordered the Cashew Chicken, it was the best CC I had ever had. 

The service here has always been great, we've always been able to make reservations and they were always prompt about seating us when we didn't make one. The bar makes pretty good drinks although they are a bit generous with their Vodka. As long as I live in Middleton I will continue dining here as it's always a stellar experience."}
{"text":"Thankfully there is one Chinese restaurant in town that is consistently good. They have a quite little bar area with a good, friendly bartender and low noise level. The manager, Karen, seems to never go home because she is always there to make sure things are going well and is very personable. We had an appetizer plate for four and it was very good. It was served with four sauces and perfect. The food is served very fast as well. It was pretty busy but we still got everything in record time. We have been here many times over the years and have always been satisfied. If you have a problem like one of the reviewers did, go up to the front desk and TELL THEM! Everyone here wants to please you and its up to you to do something then not the next day. My only complaint here, and it's not their fault, is that if you are coming from the East side it involves a little navigating to get to their driveway which is a little tricky."}
{"text":"This is a good Chinese place. Will it take you to a place you've never been? No. But you will leave satisfied."}
{"text":"What a crushing experience.
 My son was in town and when he is here we like to visit and spoil ourselves to a splurge of a dinner outing. This particular night was at the end of summer and there was an amazing thunderstorm about to occur. SO on this stormy night we decided on Chinese and I had recommended we drive to Middleton for what I had heard to be the best around.
Ok..so after a short 15 min drive we had a great parking spot...  ran inside and were greeted with a warming beautiful atmosphere.. very welcoming large foyer, nice bar area which u walk thru to get to your dining area.
After the immediate seating, WE were greeted  by a pleasant asian woman and ordered drinks. which turned out to be just right.

Appetizers were mediocre...nothing to remember...we had the app for two...calamari was HORRIBLE  btw  I could go into so much detail but who is gonna read all that....the following is my reason for writing...

My forewarning is NOT TO TRUST in ordering the Lobster dish. I wanted a decadent treat for myself and decided on the (market price) 45$ Lobster dinner entree which came with two choices of preparation. Ginger sauce or garlic butter  i ordered the garlic but the server said no the other was best.
More importantly i asked her how large the lobster was and if it was sold by pound cause it was listed as Market Price. She said she would inquire before i ordered and returned to our table and said it was 2.5 pds or larger. So that made me excited and i did not hesitate in my ordering. I thought 45 dollars was a great price for a generous 2.5 pd lobster entree.
What arrived on my plate was a cut up overly sauced jigsawed puzzled lobster animation on a platter which was in no way a 2.5 pound creature to begin with. It was dismantled then pieced together to look like a lobster shape. The meat was still in shell. (and I mean IN SHELL).  There was hardly any meat to be had. The tail which should have been the meatiest portion was cut in one inch pieces with shell INTACT and had yielded maybe 2 morsel of meat total.  I was shocked as i struggled to manipulate any source of goodness from the pieces of crustacean.There was literally no lobster and what was there was swimming in overpowering sticky sauce. All in all an EXTREME disappointment. Not what I was expecting in the LEAST!!

As the storm gained intensity outdoors, my high hopes and any thoughts of returning to this eatery were un-intensified. I will NEVER return. I cannot tolerate being misled by a server
 We ended up tipping and not making a fuss...just another lesson learned. The storm raged on , I did get to spend time with my son and hopefully educate you.. Not a total loss I guess.Just stay away from places like this that lie for profit and have followings that end up being ill fated."}
{"text":"Imperial Garden has been getting progressively worse over the last few years. The waitstaff has always been attentive and professional, and the wait time for food is reasonably short. The restaurant itself and the bathrooms are clean and spacious. The ambiance is relaxed and pleasant, and noise levels are comfortably low.

But none of these things can save the mediocre-to-bad food. That is, if you get your food at all. On more than one occasion, they have forgotten to include entire entrees or side dishes when I've picked up take-out. I now double-check all of my orders before leaving. The egg rolls taste like they came out of a box in the freezer. They are greasy and heavy, with very little flavor until you douse them in sweet-and-sour sauce that's so sweet it might as well be syrup. The same problems plague the entirely unremarkable crab rangoon. I've had the hot and sour soup, and disliked the taste quite a bit. Not spicy enough, and far too sour. I usually order the ginger beef stir-fry. There's hardly any ginger flavor, and the sauce is thick and also fairly sweet. If they halved the amount of sugar in everything, it would be a good start. I've had more success with the sizzling black pepper beef, which has a punch of black pepper and a good balance of meat and vegetables. On a recent trip, a friend got the beef lo mein. It had a nice quantity of beef, but an anemic quantity of vegetables. It was also very greasy and watery, and tasted extremely bland. The only reason I go here as often as I do is that my grandmother (the poster child for stereotypical Wisconsin taste buds, bless her heart) loves the three delicacies sizzling rice.

I did discover one saving grace: if you dump sriracha on the food, it blends very well with the food and elevates all of the flavors. Too bad they don't have any of it at the restaurant, it could save many a dish. Bottom line: there's much better, more authentic, more balanced, and less heavy Chinese food available in Madison at comparable prices. If you're looking for good Chinese in town, check out Hong Kong Cafe on Regent or Orient House on South Park instead."}
{"text":"There's a climactic scene in the movie Drive where the hero meets the badguy in a 'Chinese' restaurant. It's a prop for the movie to sell the idea of foreign while these two real bad American dudes hash out their differences. It's rich and exotic and mysterious and... goddamn exciting. 

IG is a Chinese American restaurant in the burbs of burbs that serves burbanites, but man it had that feeling.

The Russian friend and I went there on a Sunday night for their Peking Duck special. We got that and some appetizer platter and some wonton soup and some cocktails. None of it was particularly memorable, and in fact the Peking Duck skin was *not* crispy, but the presentation was spot on. There's been so much streamlining of Asian restaurants that nice chairs and big booths with lots of room is uncommon. And on top of it I am a sucker for ethnic restaurants that have good servers that can connect with customers. Do you know how rare that is? Take advantage and talk it out. Be polite and get good service.

I don't think Madison's foodies would give this place four stars. But I saw a bunch of other slant eyes here with me, and I imagined they were like me, wide eyed and happy to be here eating whatever this was.

I'd take my mom here."}
{"text":"My sister and I went here for dinner last night. We started with  shrimp rangoon. Under stuffed and flavor was OK for fried anything.  I got the sea bass with mixed vegetables and it came floating in a sauce and a few small veggies...super skimpy for a $22 dish.  My sister ordered a shrimp dish and it was meh. This place used to rock, and best Chinese food in Madison. What happened?  The table we were at was rocky and the dry wall cracked. ALL of the beautiful wood pieces on the walls were covered in thick dust.  I was thinking I go to an Asian Bistro near me for WAY LESS, and it's SO much better.  Plus they know I love the veggies and lay them on me. Don't call a dish, Sea Bass with mixed veggies and call a few sliced onions carrots and green onions so thinly sliced they were barely recognizable with mixed anything...  Who give this place 4 or 5 stars apparently also eat at fast food places and think it's a good meal. I set my standards much higher, and this place has failed in a big way.  Maybe some constructive criticism will help, rather than hinder the place. I will say our server was excellent, kind and very attentive. The table clothes were a huge plus as well.  Service was excellent, food was simply not memorable at all."}
{"text":"Im rating this more on being American Chinese then true authentic Chinese. That being said it was very nice inside. Not too formal but definitely not a take-out joint.

We got a cup of the Hot and Sour soup. Which is always my favorite. To try something different we got the Seafood Hot and Sour soup also. Almost taste just like the regular Hot and Sour put of course more of a seafood flavor then pork. It only comes in a serving that serves 2-3. Which is a great value because the 3 of us easily got 2 cups each out of it.

The Fragrant Pork had chestnuts, green peppers, onions, mushrooms and carrots in a garlic tomato sauce, Said that it was spicy hot put I only got a tiny bit of kick. Put still good being sweet and garlicky. 

The Three Delicacies Sizzling Rice dish caught me by surprise in a good way. Expecting it would come with that same bland and over salty white sauce. But I couldn't stop tasting the sauce. It was like no other white sauce I have tasted before. The waitress poured the sauce for the dish right in front of you so it was \"sizzling\". The rice was on the bottom of the skillet plate so it ended up getting crunchy. Adding a great texture to the dish. The shrimp, scallops and chicken in the dish were tender. Also in it were pea pods, water chestnuts, carrots and mushrooms.

Even the fortune cookie at the end was a better grade cookie then take-out places.

Service was helpful, attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"The only nice thing about this place is the ambiance. Unfortunately the quality of the food is quite low. The rice, for instance, was the worst I have ever eaten. I don't recommend this restaurant to anyone. There are much better Chinese restaurants in Madison and they are cheaper!"}
{"text":"Food: It's overall pretty good and probably one of the more reliable options for semi-authentic Chinese food in the Madison area.  To this Asian, there is definitely some catering to Western palates.  Definitely a step down if you're used to eating at, say, Chicago's Chinatown (both old and new sections), and there's no extra menu in Chinese with the more eclectic stuff.  Fresh seafood options very limited.

Service: Average.  Food comes in a reasonable time, though refiling the water sometimes is spotty.

Value: Reasonable overall.  Prices fit the portions. Most entrees $9-15 range.

Overall: Good for when you crave Chinese, but I'd still head to Chicago for the more authentic stuff."}
{"text":"Absolutely THE worst!  This place won \"Best of Madison\" for Chinese food for how many years??? The judge must have been completely stoned out of his mind! 
Customer service:  Very poor.  The server never checked back until I went looking for her, wondering where our order was 50 minutes after ordering. 
Food finally arrived for our group of four--STONE COLD!  Plates themselves were hot but practically frostbite on the food.  Couldn't eat it. 
Manager came by, apologized and took 50% off the bill (!!!). Should have been 100% comped. 
I'm one of those folks who normally overlooks a lot and actually hates to complain, but this culinary travesty really needed to be reported.  If this place previously had great food and service, then as of 2014 they've completely lost their \"mojo\"."}
{"text":"We only ever go for their lunch special - so that's what this review is, I haven't yet gone here for dinner.

The dishes are a little hit/miss for authenticity. The Imperial Chicken is really good (not breaded like someone else said, but it's great), the sweet and sour chicken is definitely a \"miss,\" the mu shoo pork is great, although a tad greasy, the fried spring rolls are fantastic, the egg rolls are okay. 

The service is FANTASTIC and the price is unbeatable for what you get. We never walk  away from lunch hungry. I suggest getting there a little early for lunch (they open at 11am) because it can get a little crowded.

Also, I love their spicy mustard - you have to try it!!!"}
{"text":"My feelings towards this restaurant has gone down. I ordered the chicken lettuce wrap and although the actual chicken dish was decent the lettuce they gave us was absolutely disgusting. The lettuce was served to me in a plate full of water and it tasted gross and bitter. My friend ordered the governors chicken and she was also disappointed. It's like they scattered the food on the place to make it \"look\" like a full dish. $14 for a chicken dish full of liquid? I think not. This place makes me miss the old east side location."}
{"text":"I recently moved into a neighborhood near Imperial Garden.  A few people recommended that I give it a try because the food was really good.  I had also seen the parking lot packed full of cars on a regular basis, and noted it has won a Best of Madison award for the last 30 years.

I finally tried it out, about 2 weeks after I moved in.  I had a friend in from out of town, so we decided to check it out.  I could not have been more disappointed.

We started with shrimp rangoon, which was okay, but were not stuffed very full.  We each had an entree, I can't even remember which ones because they were so unremarkable.  My friend ordered a chicken dish that was marked as \"very spicy\" and it was even more bland than my dish which involved mostly green beans.  The shrimp fried rice we shared was pretty good, maybe the saving grace of the meal.

I have no idea how this restaurant wins Best of anything awards on a regular basis.  I was very excited to have what I thought would be a great Chinese food option so close to home... but I've had better meals from a small local delivery/takeout place also nearby."}
{"text":"Imperial Garden is good.  It's not life-alteringly good.  You won't tell your grandchildren about it, but if you want a reasonably good Americanized Chinese sit-down meal for a reasonable price in the middle of an upscale Madison suburb, with an understanding of the limitations inherently provided by that context, you'll probably enjoy this place.  It's not the most authentic food ever, it's not the best decor you'll ever see, but it's good and it's consistent.  

The good:

1.  I love the servers here.  They're a hoot.  Everyone I've ever had.  They all take the job pretty seriously, and that's actually kind of cool.

2.  The vegetable egg rolls.  When you get a veggie egg roll at Panda Express or something, the wrapper is usually crappy, and it's tiny, and the filling is mushy and weird.  The veggie egg rolls here are amazing, and I can see a point in my life where I just crack and eat like four of them as a meal.  I'll probably have to remember to ask for extra sauce and mustard when this day eventually arrives.

3.  Most of the food.  I've been unhappy with one of the five entrees I've tried here, and I wouldn't order it again (the fragrant pork wasn't spectacular), but by and large, given the contextual specifications above, this is really good.

The bad:

1.  The menu's a little bit repetitive, and isn't as big as it seems.  A lot of protein swaps in otherwise identical dishes.

Overall, I definitely plan on going back."}
{"text":"I think some of the best Chinese food in Madison.  A little pricey but a few dishes always feeds me for at least two additional meals."}
{"text":"Average food.  Good service.  Not FD, but most Chinese food is generally delicious.  I would not go out of my way to eat there, but it would be a place to go now and again.

Room for large parties and family get togethers."}
{"text":"Perhaps it is because I recently had an amazing dinner at Haveli full of delicious spices, but my dinner at Imperial Garden was bland bland bland. I requested cashew shrimp \"as spicy as they can make it.\" Aside from a couple pepper flakes, no spice. Calamari was bland rubber bands. Appetizer of shrimp Rangoon? You guessed it: boring. I will say the shrimp was cooked well, so there was that. Plus the cocktail (bourbon, ginger, bitter) was tasty, otherwise we'd be looking at one star. Not sure what has happened to this place, but Madison's Best no longer."}
{"text":"This is quintessential American Chinese food. I realized that after not stepping foot into the restaurant for 12 years nothing had changed. I felt like I was in an old folks home for Chinese food. Don't get me wrong I love Americanized Chinese food, but this food just was okay. The hot and sour soup was great as it was both hot and sour with a large dose of spicy and the sesame chicken was good. Really I'd rather stay home drink some Miller lite and order Chang jang."}
{"text":"What the hell is wrong with foodies in Madison, and how was this place ever voted \"Best of\".  WTF people.  Oh, I'm sorry...I didn't realize Russian Gulag Catering was a category.  In that case.  The food was bland, lukewarm and it had texture.  I can't say enough about the mystery meat since I'm not sure what it was.  It wasn't chicken, and it definitely didn't taste like chicken.  For everyone that gave this place more than one star.  Was there a roofie in your drink and you passed out before you ate?  Or, are you in a Russian Gulag camp, and does Putin make media day trips before elections to shake hands?"}
{"text":"We visit family in Madison at least twice a year and always make sure to have dinner here.  The shrimp sizzling rice soup is absolutely to die for, and every entree I've had has been fabulous.  Hands down the best Chinese food I have ever had."}
{"text":"A fine stop. Imperial Garden was hopping at dinner time but it didn't take more than a few minutes to be seated. Service was okay; the server was super chatty but slow to stop by to take our order, check on things, and refill drinks. We ordered the sesame chicken for entree. Deep-fried chicken chunks in a thin sauce with pepper flecks and plenty of sesame seeds. Better than versions with thick and sugar-sweet sauce, but needing a bigger punch of flavor to be memorable. The portion is very generous for the price and can easily feed two people. I don't quite feel compelled to drive there from downtown for food, but if I still lived on the west side I'd probably be a somewhat regular customer since it's one of the better options in that area."}
{"text":"I've been to Imperial Gardens countless times. It's one of the few restaurants in Madison that's not a burger joint that's not \"too spicy\" for my Mom. So Imperial Gardens has become a go to sort of place when there is a reason for a family outing. 

On to the meal, there were six of us (ironically dear Mother didn't make it). We ordered: Grilled Pot Stickers, Green Beans with Garlic, Moo Shu Chicken, Governor's Chicken, Beef Epicurious, Sweet and Sour Pork, Eggplant with Garlic Sauce, and some sort of Shrimp Dish. 

This isn't a Chinese place with bold flavors. But it's consistent. Each dish was distinctly different but mild, even the Governor's Chicken.  Surprisingly the best dishes in this mix were the simplest, the green beans and the eggplant. 

The menu seems to have recently been reorganized. It seems smaller but all the usual dishes all seem to be in place. Also, you can order brown rice in addition to the standard white rice. If you're looking for the Classic Americanized Chinese Restaurant Imperial Palace is your kind of place. 

Hopefully dear old Mom will make the next outing. We did get an extra order of dumplings to go with the leftovers for Mom."}
{"text":"Yum. Check out back of menu soups. Very good!"}
{"text":"Often rumored to have the best Chinese food in the Madison area, this restaurant is a major disappointment. My spicy tofu and vegetables dish was not in the least spicy and the tofu was only fried and would have been better marinated. The entree my dining companion ordered was also sub-par. The service was very quick and the food served very quickly, maybe too much so. Madison has great Southast Asian restaurants, but I definitely won't be eating more Chinese food  anywhere here."}
{"text":"We are visiting here for many years. The quality of the food, is always good. However - year after year, the service quality goes down. Tonight - very few table was taken. There is no reason to wait 15-20 minutes before anyone will approach to say \"hello\". 
I is very ( very!) rare that we are not giving tip. Is services is not good - we give less - but we always tip. 
Tonight - we didn't gave any - it was \"just ignoring with no reason\""}
{"text":"Well, I fell for it, just like a Chinese finger trap.  When I saw the menu's written description of the striped bass served in a broth with minced vegetables, my imagination took me to a version of the dish that is likely available on either coast.  But this is Madison, so I should have known that $20 will only buy you a version of the dish that is just under the size of two decks of cards set lengthwise.  The described vegetables (maybe two tablespoons worth) were more of an accessory, which were served on top of the fish, rather than an actual \"side\".  The fish itself was flavorful, but after only 3 or 4 bites total, my memory may be a little sketchy.  The shared egg drop soup had a watery and bland taste, which even the most remedial takeout place could have surpassed."}
{"text":"My best suggestion is that if you are looking for good Chinese food, this isn't the place to go.  The tip off should have been when arriving just before 7pm on a Saturday night, the throngs of blue hairs leaving from their dinner.

Waited 20 minutes for a seat (not the worse by any means), but then was promptly seated in the bar for dinner by a cold drafty window where everyone else waiting for their tables congregated.  Essentially not very nice ambiance nor were the hosts very accommodating to the request of a place elsewhere.

The meal was very disappointing to say the least.  Appetizers took 45 minutes to reach the table and when they did they were cold.  The wait staff were completely absent outside of delivering the food.  Mind you the initial waitstaff disappeared after the appetizers were served, then followed by 3 others who too were nowhere to be found when needed.  The main courses were completely bland and calling it Chinese was a very loose interpretation.  What was supposed to be a sizzling dish, sizzled for approximately one minute and then lost heat  very quickly.

In a nutshell, if you have every eaten Chinese food outside of Wisconsin and in a large metropolitan area such as Chicago, New York, etc.,  this is not the place to go. The restaurant appears to cater to those who most likely have never traveled 20 miles outside the town they grew up in and find cheese curds the ultimate appetizer."}
{"text":"I've been going here since I was a little kid. In my opinion this is the best Chinese food in Madison. Good vegetarian options. My favorite is spicy garlic eggplant. Yum!"}
{"text":"Imperial Garden is a Madison treasure. It is one of my favorite places to go celebrate or maybe have a date night with my honey. My favorite dish is the crispy duck, We also often order their appetizers which are both yummy and more than we can ever finish. I have never had bad service and we have been there many many times. It is beautiful inside and a very relaxing place to share a meal. I always have enough for another meal the next day!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: This review is only about the 3 courses of Peking duck. We misread the menu and didn't realize there's actually no duck included in the first course - disappointing. The skin was also not crispy as advertised, but rather chewy and oily. The soup tasted good, but there were only 2-3 small pieces of duck in each bowl. Finally the sautéed duck dish was a fairly decent size and contained mostly duck, thankfully. 

The service was great - attentive (with drink refills), but not overbearing. 

If I were to go back, I'd order other dishes instead."}
{"text":"We go here with friends who have been eating here for over 18 years.  We have probably been eating here for at least 10.  The food is good, fresh and hot.  Most of the time the service is reasonable but it all depends on how busy they may get.  There was one time that it took almost an hour and when our party of six finally got served, one of the six had to wait about another 20 minutes for their food.  Everyone else was almost done eating.  The waitress kept apologizing but I don't know what the problem was but it was apparent it was in the kitchen.  We have had take out from here also.  Be sure to call ahead.  I like spicy food so ask for extra hot sauce as most of the food can be mild.  One time our party tried desserts of mango, green tea and another flavor ice cream which was a treat."}
{"text":"Chinese food on a table cloth? It's not quite a unicorn, but it's pretty rare. Imperial Garden has a litany of awards from Madison Magazine and I'm certainly not going to disagree with the well earned accolade. The Governor's chicken, moo sho pork (and pancakes) and mixed fried rice are the MVPs. Hand's down. And they have a pretty nice bar with a decent repertoire.

The crowd skews a little older and more gentile, but it shouldn't matter because you'll likely be more focused on trying to cram as much delicious food onto your chopsticks as you can. That's what a gentleman would do."}
{"text":"Best Chinese around.  Have won Best of Madison for over 20 years straight.  The Governor's Chicken is one of the best selections.  The fried rice is very good also.  I would just remind people, this is the Imperial Garden that is in Middleton.  Do not confuse this with the one on the east side of Madison.  They are two completely separate restaurants with different owners, menus, managers, philosophies, etc.  There is a big difference between the two, so make sure you are enjoying and reviewing the right one!"}
{"text":"Very good authentic Chinese food! Beautiful restaurant decor. Feels like you're in China! Hefty portions. Very good grilled dumplings, shrimp lo mein, and  ginger soy sauce. White rice is better than the brown. Also, the shrimp rangoon filling is a little tasteless. Could use some salt. Friendly staff. The only drawback is that the meals are a tad pricey. But considering the portions, they aren't bad! Fast service, too. Overall, a good restaurant! (I would give it 3.5 stars)"}
{"text":"This is our go-to Chinese restaurant in the Madison area.  Hands down, it's the best Chinese I've found so far.  I'd give it 5 stars if the prices were more reasonable and the dine-in environment was better.

Like I said, the food is superb.  My usual dish is Cashew Chicken.  It's hard to deviate from that when it's sooooo good.  Other dishes are excellent as well.  What I like about Imperial is that the meat quality is good.  The beef is tasty and tender - not tough or \"questionable\".  The chicken is good as well - not some of the gray chicken-like material found at lesser establishments.  

We don't dine in often or at all.  It's a little more formal than I prefer, and the experience can take a while.  Just not my preference.  I keep their number in my phone and call ahead for carry-out.  That's the way to go here, imho.

Their location is very convenient for those of us that work in town and live in the western 'burbs.  The portions they give out are very fair - my cashew chicken typically leaves me with a nice lunch for work the next day. 

If you're looking for top-quality Chinese food, I highly recommend getting take-out here.  If you don't mind a more formal setting and have the time, go ahead and dine in."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places to get sit down Chinese food in the Madison area! I have so many fantastic memories of dining here throughout the years. My heart just warms up and my stomach start growling when someone mentions Imperial Garden. 

Imperial Garden has a large dining hall, yet when you are seated you feel extremely cozy. The menu is giant in the sense that is very extensive and very big literally. Thankfully, they divided the menu into different sections like beef, chicken, vegetarian, and lunch! 

The only downfall is that they don't do delivery, but they do pick up!

The garlic green beans are spectacular, and every time I think of them my mouth waters. All the fried rices are phenomenal. 

In addition to the delicious foods, the service is amazing and attentive. They are prompt, and your water glass will hardly ever be empty! When you are seated, they get to you in a timely matter and will get you started with anything you want! 

With those things, there is a reason why I've been dining here for numerous years."}
{"text":"Other reviewers have noted problems with the service, and indeed the service is some of the worst I've ever had.  We went with a large group, and had reserved a private room. You might think this would make for more attentive service, but the opposite was true.  Once the doors to the room were closed the waitstaff seemed to forget about us.  Long delays in service meant that we had to get up and find waitstaff (can't just flag them in a private room) to ask that plates be cleared, and so forth.  

Poor service should deter prospective diners, but if you do decide to eat here know that this is not Chinese food but American Chinese food, characterized by fried meats and sweet sauces.  As American Chinese food, the execution is decent -- however, real Chinese food is much tastier."}
{"text":"I am not sure WHY I've never been here before. 

The food and service was absolutely perfect. Where do I begin? 

We arrived around 5pm on a Monday. Seated right away in a very comfortable booth. Very nice ambience. Our server was very attentive during our entire time there. 

Ordered the Shrimp Rangoon for an appetizer. Nice and light, not heavy at all. Perfect crispness to them and great flavor. The ginger lemon dipping sauce was very good. 

Two entrees: 

1.Half order of the Shrimp Snow Peas and half order of the fragrant shrimp. 

2. Sesame Chicken

The fragrant shrimp tomato base sauce might just be the BEST sauce I've ever tasted. A little sweet with a little heat to it. Devine!! The shrimp in both dishes were cooked perfectly and just melted in your mouth. 

The sesame chicken had the best batter on the chicken. Light and a perfect crispness to it. 

Best Chinese meal in ages. I WILL be coming back to try more and I WILL bring more people with me. Thank you for a great evening."}
{"text":"This place is an old family favorite. They are consistent in their preparation, good quality and service. They are NOT your run of the mill cheap Chinese chain nor do they offer the more daring, traditional style cuisine that some of the smaller places in town now do and can take a bit more courage. Food here is simply delicious. Be sure to order the mu shu with handmade pancakes and any of the governor's entrees - both wonderful choices."}
{"text":"Dinner for friends birthday. Was a Wednesday, but the clientele was mostly retired folks. Initially seated in an area that was freezing but server graciously moved us to warmer seating area. Service was excellent!  Cashew chicken probably isn't the most adventurous order but was surprisingly bland. The chicken was plentiful and they accommodated my dislike of water chestnuts without fuss. Portions are large. The leftovers were expertly packaged and made for two small dinners after. I'd be likely to go back especially if they might modernize the decor to be more hip and sleek. Maybe should have tried the bar area?"}
{"text":"This place is more about atmosphere than food.  Probably the worst Chinese/American food I ever ate. If you want a romantic Chinese/American dinner this is the place. If you want good Chinese/American food stay away from this place. Will never eat here again. The service was good though. Old, old fruit for my garnish in my drink. For the price, they should have cut fresh fruit."}
{"text":"Second bite I had a food had Fat in it.
Waitress can't remember what we ordered. Never asked us our food was.
We had to walk to the front desk to pay her bill. I wanted to run out of that place"}
{"text":"The first time I was here I had tofu stir-fried with vegetables, and it was passable. On today's second visit I had minced tofu with vegetables and mandarin pancakes. The pancakes were just right, but the filling was as bland as paste. 

I sprinkled on some soy sauce to give the dish at least sone flavor--which I don't do, nor should I if the cook had done his job--and it didn't sit well on my stomach. I burped lunch all afternoon. My companion had a similar reaction. 

I will not come here again."}
