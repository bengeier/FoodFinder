{"text":"Nice food but only veg available. I love their shahi paneer.  And they have good sweets too"}
{"text":"My favorite stop on a Saturday afternoon.   Tali is delicious and there are many options to change it up each time. I would give this restaurant 5 stars if the washrooms were better maintained."}
{"text":"Good food for good price! love their mixed vegetable parontey and their indian tea is out of this world!"}
{"text":"This is a good take out vegetarian spot. We tried a few dishes. I found some to be a bit salty at first but I think that it wasn't an issue in the end. The spice levels are good (high when needed) and the sweets have a great fresh flavor to them. The variety of take out dishes isn't huge, but there is enough choice to make a great meal of it. I'm not sure of the exact names of what we got, but the cheese in gravy was great, a chopped cheese dish (kind of has a texture of rice) was a favorite and the saag paneer was solid.  A fourth dish with an okra like veg has good spice and flavor. The naan could have been fluffier. The people who work here are really nice."}
{"text":"I found this place by accident. I was craving for butter chicken., didn't even bother to read the sign that it's vegetarian so of course there's no meat around.  Because I do not know how to speak punjabi and even though i tried to explain what I wanted they ended up giving me full meal,.. that I didn't even get to finish. Some of it are nice..I thought I would want to come back which I did... but .. for some reason the inconsistency of the food and how it's made quite disappoint me... sometimes it's right... sometimes too salty... sometimes you have to beg for more paneer... sometimes you don't even have to ask,.. The inconsistency of the food goes along with the service.  ..There will be times that  they'll be nice and smiling to you... and sometimes  they make you feel so unwelcome."}
{"text":"Overall there are 2 locations in the same area. They are both a decent size and carry both sweets and lunch/dinner. It can be busy depending on what time of the day you come. The sweets are pretty good and the food is usually pretty fresh. The only thing I would have to comment on is that the service is lacking"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Nominal pricing. Great location. Friendly staff. Clean environment. This restaurant only serves vegetarian food and they don't have a lot of options but is still far superior to some of the bigger establishments in Brampton. And you can never stop at the thali. Gotta go for more."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant many times when they first opened (which was years ago) I was in there today. I placed my order over the phone, thinking they would have the naans ready and we would just have to go in and pick out the curries. This place is a disaster when they see more then 3 people in line waiting to order. They don't have a proper system. The staff ignores one another, kind of in a way where they are showing whose \"boss\". I seen my naans waiting near the cash register. I paid for the food. And after 25 mins of waiting for them to proceed other orders whom were waiting for their naans to be made. They had them pick out the curries before us, knowing the fact our naans are ready and getting cold. This place was much better when it was run by the owner's family. Now it's just a bunch of young girls who have attitude issues with one another. When we got home, not only were our naans cold they were burnt as well. I hope they owner pulls this place together soon. Before they get more bad reviews for more disappointed customers."}
{"text":"Small cozy shop with delicious \"home made\" food. My go to place for stuffed parathas.

The chat and jalebis are worth a try too . Portions are huge, price is low."}
