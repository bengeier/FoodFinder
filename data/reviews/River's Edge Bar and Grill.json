{"text":"Great service and great food.  We had salmon and peel and eat shrimp and both were wonderful.  The service was quick and friendly with great attention to our needs.  Our first trip here but not our last"}
{"text":"So often at places that are self-contained, the food is terrible and overpriced because they have a ravenous captive audience. (Hello, Carowinds? That comment was aimed at you. Step it up and stop serving three raggedy hamburgers made from the worst part of the cow and an order of deep fried chicken lips disguised as real food all for forty bucks. It's just wrong.) At the U.S. National Whitewater Center in Charlotte, the River's Edge Bar & Grill is a refreshing option overlooking the rapids and climbing rock there.

Indoor and outdoor seating in the lodge-like building is comfortable and staffed by competent and an uber obliging servers. A daily rotation of craft beers and selections from a surprisingly impressive menu that favors healthy and fresh options are abundant. Said options are great for athletes participating in the myriad of activities at the Whitewater Center, and for those who are athletic in the \"show up for the free Thursday night summertime River Jam concerts\" kind of way. 

Standouts on the menu include The Hawfield and Apple Walnut Chicken Salads, Black Betty Burger, and the Pulled Chipotle Chicken Sandwich. All of the menu options are priced fairly and worth the cost, and considering the Whitewater Center isn't exactly centrally located for most Charlotteans, it is so worth the trip try some tree top zip lining or whitewater rafting worthy of U.S. Olympian training, and then hunker down on the deck for a brew and a nosh in a venue that is such a boon to Charlotte and the surrounding areas in so many ways. 

N.B.: Parking is five dollars per vehicle even if you are just coming by to walk the free trails or dine at the restaurant, and there really isn't another option to deposit a car nearby.This has caused discord among many who visit the venue; however, it is a nominal fee for the opportunity to spend time at such a unique venue in the area."}
{"text":"I will give the whitewater center 5 stars easy. But this may have been one of the worst experiences at a restaurant I've ever had. We order food and it came out promptly (a little to quick actuslly). Was interesting because I thought oh it will be nice and hot. Wrong! With exception of chix tenders for my daughter everything was incorrect and sides were wrong. Oh and it was all cold. We sent it back. Came out again and it was all wrong again! I was done at this point but my friend was starving and wanted to eat her hamburger but the guy already took it and put a plate on top of hamburger. When my friend said \"wait I still want\" it he took the plate off the hamburger and gave it back. At this point I was just blown away. The guy looked at me with snarky condescending voice and \"oh well what do you want?\" ( I am not exaggerating on this btw). At this point I asked for a Mgr because that was just beyond the sh#$ list for me. I watched the server multiple times tell his Mgr. He would look over at us then just mope around the restaurant talking to the female servers. 3 times the server asked him to come by or do sonething. FINALLY I had to track my server down and tell sorry man at this point  I am not paying for anything. (Which was fair because it all came out wrong and cold twice).The only thing  that came out even remotely correct was the bottle of magic hat #9.

I probably wouldn't have written this but the thing with the Mgr pushed me over the edge.

Now I have worked in restaurants for about 15 years so I'd like to think I know a little bit about service and this was some of the worst I've ever had. I NEVER write reviews but I'm a HUGE fan of the white water center and feel the need to say something. If you want to just sell crappy bar food then do t try to make so fancy. Oh and cheddar cheese on fish tacos with salmon as the fish? Thats a serious wtf? Scale the menu down and execute the food better because I have had 10 times better food in a hole in the wall bar.

PS I still tipped my waiter since the Mgr thing was not his fault."}
{"text":"Had an early dinner at Rivers Edge before the mountain biking film debut. Fantastic beer selection and great advice from our waiter Danielle on best beer selection for our taste. Pulled pork was great, brisket and salmon BLT were great value for the money. 

Can't beat the view and atmosphere - sunset on the terrace over the whitewater. Definitely coming back soon."}
{"text":"It's not like there's really a choice of sustenance when you're hungry at the Whitewater Park...but the River's Edge makes a good effort anyhow. I've eaten here a handful of times and they seem to be hit or miss on their fries, but the food is always pretty good.

Okay...so I almost always get a pimento cheeseburger...but they make a pretty good one. My wife gets a sandwich that mixes brisket and pulled pork. It's pretty dern good. My kids like the peanut butter and marshmallow fluff sandwiches...and the seasoned fries and sweet potato fries are pretty good when they're good.

What I like most about the River's Edge Bar and Grill...is the beer selection they have on tap. You can expect at least ten different quality micro-brews and seasonal beers. I just had a remarkable Oktoberfest beer by Foothills while enjoying some fried pickles.

Try: The pimento cheeseburger and a Dale's Pale Ale

Avoid: Ordering Miller Lite with so many great beers on tap"}
{"text":"I was there on Friday July 8th and there was a band called Jaded. The place was not busy, the band was okay at best, a few people were dancing. The place is filthy and the rest rooms were even filthier. When the band ended at the end of the night a women went up to the stage to ask the band something. Much to my surprise, the lead singer of Jaded told this women \"she can get on her knees in front of him\". I was astonished, my husband could not believe it either. The guy this women was with was coming back from, I think, the restroom and heard this. The guy told the singer that was his girlfriend and a fight almost broke out. My husband said if the singer said that to me he would have kicked his ass. We will not be going back to this filthy, disgusting, degrading bar again."}
{"text":"We came two days after Christmas to walk our dog and take in some activities.  After I ordered 2 beers and an order of fries. The beer and fries were decent but the service absolutely sucked. We waited 15 minutes for someone to take our order. Keep in mind it wasn't even crowded.  Then I wanted to pay and believe it or not, it took another 15 minutes for them to take my money. Service should not be this bad. Especially when it's not crowded."}
{"text":"Stopped by River's Edge for some lunch while out adventuring at the USNWC.  Again, I really enjoyed my food and my buddies did too.  Pricey, yes - but still delicious.  I had a Cuban sandwich and sweet potato fries which were delicious.  I sampled some of my friend's bean, beef and beer chili and also was pleased.  Be warned that it has some after-spice.  My other friend got a salad and finished it all as well.  Great spot!"}
{"text":"Save time, money, and sanity by never eating here. This is the 2nd bad experience I've had here and they are no longer getting chances. My family came in, we all ordered burgers & fries. Simple right? Over an hour later still no food. The waitress was very nice & apologetic. It was not her fault. However, we kept being told the kitchen was backed up. I understand there were people outside but there was hardly anyone sitting outside & there were a ton of people working in the kitchen. Our burgers finally came out after 1 hour & 15 minutes. My husband's was cold, daughter's was frozen in the middle, and my Dad's still had a cheese wrapper on the cheese! We called the manager over and he was completely oblivious to how crappy that is. He said, \"all I can do is apologize.\" Um no. You can comp my meal because we weren't eating it! Absolutely terrible!"}
{"text":"This is a great, accommodating restaurant with a chef who really likes to explore delicious food. 
 
I just went to one of the Craft Dinners with Highland Brewing Company and the food and beer pairings were amazing.  The plates were well balanced and all the preparations of the ingredients were spot on.  

The guest services team went above and beyond to make it a great night, too."}
{"text":"This place overlooks the US National Whitewater Center's main activity area. It is an absolutely gorgeous view come sunset and perfect on Thursday nights during the summer when they have free live entertainment. I have been to the USNWC before but never ate at this place. It did not disappoint, we had quick seating and service. They had a nice beer selection---not overbearing like some other places and the prices weren't too high. 

My group had an appetizer of fried pickles with ranch dipping sauce which was great (you really cant go wrong with that) 

I had the Apple Walnut Chicken Salad -Marinated grilled chicken atop spring mix with apples, crumbled bleu cheese and candied walnuts with Balsamic Vinaigrette 

Fantastic salad! It was very refreshing and the candied walnuts added a nice sweet touch to contrast the apples. And I am all for any kind of crumbled cheese! I was looking at the hummus plate but needed something cool and refreshing and this hit the spot! 

I definitely recommend this place, the service was good, food was great and you cannot beat the location. Go on a Thursday or Saturday night during the summer and there is live music and you can hang around after and just chill. So happy Charlotte has this place!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time on Saturday. I was told there was a beer fest at the center that day, but this isn't a new thing they've had going on. I've been to the beer tastings before but never ate at the Grill. First off, an hour to an hour and 15min wait is the craziest thing I have ever heard. More so since the inside tables had only 3 parties actually sitting at them. When I asked about the tables the hostess said that all the other tables had been reserved for other parites, but no one was coming into the grill to actually sit down for their reservation. I just didn't really understand what was going on there. So we sat outside and drank our beer and peaced out, I won't ever wait an hour for glorified bar food. thats nuts, I say no reservations for this spot, first come first serve, might make people move faster! I just really didn't understand why it could have taken an hour or so to get service."}
{"text":"Seriously drives me crazy, there is so much potential here, but!!! Every time, horrible service, very disorganized... We have a 45 minute wait for a 2 top, but then people who get here 30 min after us sit right down... This place needs to get there act together!"}
{"text":"Way better than expected. service is fairly fast. 

Smoked wing app was tasty but for $6 you would expect at least 6 wings, NOT! The Brisket is blah, dry, blah, blah, blah and bbq sauce is just poured on top, both types of fries were descent, the salmon BLT was a pretty good size, tasty, but a touch overdone. The cilantro slaw is a refreshing twist; tangy and crunchy.

A good selection of beer that is great after hitting the trails."}
{"text":"This place saved the day. We came here for some outdoor adventuring and even after checking it out online before hand and talking to staff when we arrived we quickly got the run around about whether or not the kids could do thing like obstacle courses and rock climbing and none of the staff seemed to be on the same page. So I was stuck with three disappointed adventure-less kids... so I decided to stop into the Rivers Edge Bar and Grill to get them a treat while the rest of our party went on the zip line. They each ordered the strawberry balsamic ice cream and LOVED it. My two 2 year old (who I had originally planned to share with) took one bite and exclaimed, \"oh my gosh it's sooo good!\" Then she refused to share with me!! My 7 and 5 year old (who I consider to be the ice cream experts) said it was the best strawberry ice cream they ever had! And when I did finally get a bite, I was inclined to agree with them.
The service was a bit slow during the lunch rush but they were pretty busy for a Saturday. But they had excellent chai cider and great outdoor seating for watching all the activities!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this restaurant.  We have a season pass to the Whitewater Center and enjoy coming here after some good physical activities.  They have an AWESOME draft beer selection with the majority being NC brews.  They also have an extended selection in bottles.  The beers are always changing around and it's awesome to grab a 24 oz. microbrew for $6.  The food has always been very good.  I usually get the chili and my girl gets one of the salads.  The chili is really good and they put a nice dollop of pimiento cheese on top.  I start salivating when I think about it..and it's just chili.  The salad she gets is made with a good spring mix, not that iceburg BS.  She gets it topped with grilled tuna and it's just amazing.  She usually doesn't finish it, so that's why I always get the chili, it's cheap and I always get to put the rest of hers down.  I love being the garbage disposal of the relationship.  There's nothing better than trail running, kayaking, grabbing a great beer & food while watching folks flip out of the rafts on one of the bigger rapids of the park!"}
{"text":"Food is terrible and extremely bland.  Blah.  We've tried several times just hoping we had caught them on a bad day.  Nope.  It really is that bad.  They have a captive audience and maybe that's why the WWC tries to do as little as possible to resemble a real restaurant.   Also, the wine pours are a joke.  Their wine could be served in a shot glass."}
{"text":"I felt bad for our server who was wearing dark blue polyester on a 90 degree day.  They all looked like they were melting in the sun.

But the hostess was honest about the wait time, drinks were served fast and cold.  And the food was great when it finally arrived.  

In summer it can get pretty packed so it helps to have patience.  If you're going to sit outside you better have sunscreen.  There's good people working here and it's a great time out at the Whitewater Center."}
{"text":"This is the only sit-down style restaurant at the US National Whitewater Center. The first time I went, I was surprised by the menu. It's actually averaged priced ($9-$12 for a sandwich & side) compared to the jacked up amusement park prices I was anticipating. Their menu offers a lot of healthier style options than some restaurants, and the quality has always been good. I'd highly recommend the Pilgrim burger (turkey burger with goat cheese, apple, & honey mustard sauce). The western burger (bbq sauce, lettuce, fried onions) is also delicious. I found the bun to be a little but dry this time around though. 

Appetizer wise, the nachos are awesome and a good portion for sharing."}
{"text":"I recently dined at the River's Edge Bar and Grill on a warm fall Saturday.  Despite being overwhelmingly busy, we were seated within the 30 min. time frame as promised.  Our waitress, however, was annoyed by any request we made.  By request, I mean, asking for silverware or refills on our empty drinks.  When she initially took our drink orders she turned to walk away after my friend ordered her drinks and when I stopped her and said, \" I'd like to order a drink as well.\", she acted as if this was a huge inconvenience and didn't even acknowledge that she didn't take my order.
   .. Moving on, I got the Mojo Quesadilla and an order of Sweet Potato Fries.  The fries were good but definitely from the freezer.  The Quesadilla on the other hand,......disgusting!  Amidst, lobs and lobs of curdled, fried Cheddar there were about 3 small nickel sized pieces of chicken.  Keep in mind, this was after sifting through 5 pieces \"triangles\" if you will, of the Quesadilla.  I should have refused to pay for the meal as I did not receive a chicken Quesadilla but rather a fried cheese patty.  We were so disappointed that we just paid our bill and left.
   Next time, we won't even bother with the restaurant.  For what it's worth, the walk in \"deli/café\" next door looked more promising."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Obviously it's at the US National Whitewater Center, an olympic training center with all sorts of cool stuff going on. The restaurant has  shaded outdoor seating where you can watch rafts and kayaks go down the rapids. Factor in that it's going  to cost you 5 dollars to park, not a big deal but keep it in mind. I had a burger with sweet tea and both were very good. Mom had a chicken wrap that was also very good. Sis is a vegetarian and she had something she liked I honestly forget what but she was happy. The waffle cut sweet potato fries and the roasted vegetables are not to be  missed. The service was fast and friendly, they were very happy to pack us up some tea to go.  So yeah go check it out have some lunch and ride the zip line or walk on the trails. We didn't do any of that stuff because .. you know... HEAT but it all looked like fun as we ate lunch."}
{"text":"Dined here during a day of activities at the USNWC. Really surprised at the quality of food and price point (in a good way) for a restaurant located inside a tourist attraction. I ordered the mushroom, onion, Swiss beef burger with a side of Mac n cheese and a can of apple cider. The burger patty was a little smashed and generally reminded me of an upgraded burger from Smashburger (that's always a plus in my book). The Mac was a bit over cooked, but the creamy cheese made up for it. Perfectly portioned and finished everything. Had a great time with great views. We were promptly seated and served. We had a friendly and attentive waitress named Anna too!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst restaurants in Charlotte. No Joke. The service is horrible. Bad attitude, not helpful and lazy. The food tastes like cheap frozen boxes.. The view is great, but don't eat there."}
{"text":"The view does not make up for the experience. Service was slow, management staff was unfriendly, we waited 45 minutes to even see a server and we had to wait even longer to put in an order, and the food was sub par. Overall a less than enjoyable experience. I will definitely not be going back."}
{"text":"Didn't have the best experience here. The waiter was slow and absent most of the meal. I got the black Betty burger (a veggie burger), and it was yuck! I usually have pretty low standards to begin with when ordering a veggie burger (will never be as good as meat), but this thing was just bad. The consistency was all mush... Sweet potato fries were good though... So that's something. Great for beers after hiking and doing all the water sports! So food, not so great (at least the meal I had), but awesome location for a bar."}
{"text":"Once people who were seated after us received and finished their meals before we received ours, I started to get a little irritated.  Our meal finally arrived but I had ordered a grilled chicken sandwich and received a chicken salad sandwich.  The waiter took responsibility for his error, offered to get me the grilled chicken sandwich.  No big deal, I started eating the chicken salad sandwich and was enjoying it.  After about my 4th bite, I noticed that there were two pieces of hair that were definitely not mine or anyone's at my table in my sandwich.  I told the waiter about it, he took it back, and took it off the bill. It's all he could have done but I won't be back to eat here again."}
{"text":"I used to rave about the food here, but in the last two years the menu has changed and possibly the chef as well. Dined here post-paddleboarding with a group of friends so we were starving! We ordered fried pickles as an appetizer, which came out steaming hot and were delicious. I decided to go with the classic burger (The Fundamentalist) with a side of sweet potato fries. Little did I know that EVERY burger is cooked to medium well. I would have greatly appreciated if our server informed us of that so i could have changed my order. The fries were good though! My friends ordered salads (massive portions) which they enjoyed. The beer menu is extensive and offers many local options."}
{"text":"If you go by the rules at USNWC, then you know that you cannot bring in any food or drink on the property. Well, that makes bank for River's Edge! 

For the only restaurant on site (even though they have a couple sandwiches-to-go stations, it's pretty good. I've eaten here a couple times and both times I've been pleasantly surprised with the menu offerings and the tastiness of the food. They offer very good veggie burgers. 

Great place to fill up your tank before heading for the white water!"}
{"text":"So we ended the Labor day festivities after working up an appetite by having dinner at the River's Edge Bar and Grill.

The food is okay. They forgot to put the coleslaw with the BBQ Brisket Sandwich. I tasted someone else's coleslaw and was not impressed. Where is the cilantro? only a piece. My friend did not like the coleslaw after tasting it. The fries was greasy and soggy. At least the BBQ strips were cooked and swimming in BBQ sauce. The Brioche was really a roll. I must be thinking of Paris and their fluffy buttery Brioche wait not the same in the US.

There was a good selection of beer available and drinks.

The dessert saved the day. Had the Apple Fritter A La Mode which came out of the hot with a scoop of ice-cream. 

The waitress we had was great too."}
{"text":"We visited the White Water Center and had an early dinner here this past weekend. We were pretty exhausted and dehydrated from waiting an hour and a half for the zip lining and walk back. We decided to sit indoors. It took a while for someone to wait on us. I was underwhelmed with our waiter as he slow to wait on us, nor did he check to see if our food was okay after the runner brought it out. I didn't receive any dressing for my salad but someone else stopped by and got some for me. Our food and the other staff made up for our waiter's lack of attentiveness though. I had the chipotle chicken burrito with a side salad. The ingredients in the burrito and salad were super fresh. The burrito was delicious and really hit the spot. My friend got a different chicken wrap, which she really liked. The prices were really reasonable, as well. Our entrees were around 10 bucks each. I wouldn't mind coming here again one evening to just hang out on the patio and watch people raft while having a good meal."}
{"text":"My family and I ate here today and our experience started off positive, but thereafter was very poor. We were quoted a 50 minute wait for a table of four and were sat literally minutes after putting our name in. Odd to be quoted a long wait and be seated suddenly without waiting, but we happily accepted the table. 

It took several minutes for a waiter to even greet us, when he finally did we started with an order of the fried pickles. Appetizer was brought out quickly, pickles were hot and really good! The General Manager brought out our appetizer and he was really pleasant, nice guy. Unfortunately from there our dining experience was horrible...

Where to begin...

After bringing our waters, our server never once asked if we wanted refills or needed anything (which we did!). Another server brought our food to the table and said she would bring us new fries because she noticed they had seen better days. They were very cold and hard. She promptly brought us new fries, but stated they probably wouldn't be any better. Sooo, why even bring them at all??? Our original server also said he would get us fresh fries which never came, we gave up after waiting 20 minutes.  My blackened chicken sandwich was made incorrectly and our server said he would bring the special sauce (key ingredient in the sandwich), another 20 minutes later the sauce finally arrived. At this point we asked to see the Manager and politely explained our meal and service was pretty lackluster to say the least. Manager comped a portion of the bill which was appreciated. However when I gave her my card for the appetizer and kids meal I was left waiting AGAIN for someone to return my card so I could simply sign the bill and leave. After 15 minutes I had to go look for it myself. 

Hopefully other food items and other servers are better than what we had today! Definitely don't see us going back anytime soon unfortunately."}
{"text":"First time dining here and on the whole, it was a nice dining experience.

Drove over from Davidson after Church and while we had to wait a few minutes,it was not a long wait.  We got out of Church and left Davidson around 10:40 and got to the restaurant around 11:20 so we had to wait 10 minutes since they do not open till 11:30.

It's a very nice restaurant with the main attraction being the views of the US National Whitewater Training Center and the other attractions such as Zip Lines, Bike Path, Cliff Climbing rocks etc.

We were promptly seated at a table at the edge looking down to the lower cataracts on the Competition Section. Fortunately we picked a good day and even though it was humid, temperature was in the mid 70's.

It's a good menu with an emphasis on Sandwiches, Pastas, Burgers, Wraps etc. Several items looked good and in the end, we both ended up with Ham and Cheese Panini's.  For a side, I ordered Potato Salad while my wife asked to substitute Wheat Berry for the Sour Dough which then did and for the side, grilled pineapple.

We both had tea as out beverage and even though I order half and half, it was still too sweet so I hate to think what the regular sweet tea would be.

Lunch came out shortly and service was excellent.  The Ham and Cheese Panini's was good but not outstanding. No latent heat from the Panini Press and the tomato had the taste of a Tomato in February.  Plenty on meat on the Sandwich though and the Potato Salad was good.

This was out first time though and when the Grand kids come up in the fall, we will probably take them here. My wife is already planning on getting a bunch of the ladies in the neighborhood together and coming over for lunch."}
{"text":"Great little spot to watch all the zip liners and white water rafters. It also has a pretty nice and reasonable menu that's pleasing to all. You can get a big juicy burger and fries or a really amazing tofu sandwich with smoked coconut on it ( I love this sandwich, soooo good)."}
{"text":"Pretty average food - burgers, salads, sandwiches. You're paying a premium for being at the whitewater center. I had the poached shrimp salad. Not bad, but wouldn't go back. The view from the outdoor seating area is nice, though."}
{"text":"Food is good, beer is way overpriced and service is fair at best. Scenary is obviously stellar but God forbid if you ask for a slight change to your salad 
Chef way to proud for a place such as this."}
{"text":"Food and service was okay at best. I ordered a different type of cheese on my burger than what they brought me. They peeled off the wrong melted cheese and brought back the cold burger with cold cheese."}
{"text":"Exceptionally frustrating place - so much potential and great location but consistently falls down on execution.

Tried to go there during a beautiful late-winter sunny day. Stopped by at 1:30 pm and was told it was a 45 minute wait. . .full disclosure, I hate waiting for a table but couldn't figure out why they were so packed. 

Turns out that the management team decided to renovate the entire interior during the busiest weekend in the last three months! There literally was no inside seating option, no take-out options, nothing. . .And, this wasn't the first time that this has happened! We ended up driving out of the center and went to Belmont for lunch.

On top of it all, I overheard another family venting about how they waited 45 minutes for their meal (and I've had that also happened!). At the end of the day, it doesn't matter how good the location is if the service and food don't meet a normal expectation.

They really need to get experienced restaurant operators there who know how to deal with crowds and manage a brewpub-style place. Maybe reach an agreement with Duckworths or the Liberty team to have them take it over???"}
{"text":"I really love the white center.  and what a perk to have to have a restraunt with healthy food options on site, and where I can watch the rafters.  But the service truly depends on the waiter, waitress, individually.  it has been great.  and like today, it has been awful.  but still enjoyed the food and setting."}
{"text":"I don't have anything ground breaking to say. We were there on one of the River Jam evenings. The staff seems to continue to struggle with the volume of people. I think our server did her best. We ordered an app pretty quickly but we didn't see her again for a long time. I caught her eye and asked to order and she looked really confused that we wanted to order an entree... which confused me. The food was just ok. A lot of it seemed packaged and plated. It's about what I would expect from this type of joint. Overall, just alright."}
{"text":"I'd give it no stars if possible. Ever had the big time hangry's? Well, after a 2 hour bike ride I did and thought I'd just stick around and grab a bite.
The young hostess seated me, and that's pretty much where I stayed for over the next 10 minutes with absolutely no one serving me, all the while with multiple servers hanging around the young blonde hostess' stand ignoring me as I sat alone at my table. Now, others were seated during this time in another area and promptly served, but unless completely ignored for some reason as the male servers continued their attention to the young hostess. Never again, and shame on them."}
{"text":"I've been here close to a dozen times.  They seem to have changed the menu since last summer, and instead of fresh, cooked-to-order options, have gone with more prepackaged garbage.

For example, yesterday I ordered the Black Bean burger, which used to be a delicious homemade patty that was full of fresh ingredients, and homemade guacamole.  Instead, I got a (formerly) frozen black bean patty and some kind of liquified guacamole that must have come out of a tube.

My friend ordered fish tacos, a new item on the menu, and the salmon appeared to also be (formerly) frozen with painted on grill marks.  I was very disappointed.

The beer selection continues to be outstanding, though the prices appeared to go up a significant amount over the past winter as well.

Very disappointing.  The staff is always friendly, but the food has just gone downhill in the past year.  If there were other options at the whitewater center, I'd seek them out, but alas, it's the only choice."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a very pleasant surprise. I have been to more than a few restaurants which are exclusive to a site, and the food produced is overpriced, canned rotework.

Not here. The food tasted fresh, and while it was pricey for what was casual food, the location and the execution sold me. One hummus appetizer (which was beloved at the table), four entrees, one bottle of wine and three beers added up to $80. In the great scheme of things, maybe this wasn't pricey after all.

Those of you who love beer will appreciate the number of tap lines in the bar. From the mainstream to the obscure, there is something for anyone who fancies a beer with their food.

A great place to spend time with family and friends in a unique setting. The dress can be very casual if you like. There is nothing in Uptown, Ballantyne or elsewhere which matches this experience."}
{"text":"Great location over looking the whitewater rapids and rest of the center. Peak times = long wait, slow service. Food is good after a long day of mountain biking, whitewater rafting, flat water kayaking, bouldering, and whatever else they have. Veggie burger is always tasty. Sweet potato fries are a nice touch. Beer is plentiful."}
{"text":"Was at the white water center and needed a quick bite.  Food is ok and is consistent with the previous reviews.   

Had the burger and it was good.  It fit the need.  I know that they have other things but the menu is pretty limited.  I wish that they would have a healthier selection."}
{"text":"Nice beer selection, from a variety of taps. to several  selected cans. I had the Bison burger, which was very good. A little pricey for the size of the patty. Service was fast, but the center was quite the day I was there."}
{"text":"Was here for dinner and then the live music last week. We had about 15 in our group. They got us seated pretty quick considering our group size and the fact they were packed. I enjoyed the chicken Cesar salad and Lesley said the salmon BLT was great. Jake did an excellent job as our server, keeping our drinks full and the cold beer flowing. Recommend if you want a casual dinner with an enjoyable patio to relax on after you eat. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere, beer selection and service are great! Food is okay at best, prices are such that the mediocre food doesn't completely annoy you thought."}
{"text":"I never would have thought this place to have such good food but it does.  I tried the Cuban here and it was stupendous!  I loved it, fresh, hot and yummy in my tummy.  Outside of this particular sandwich, they also do a chicken or pork bowl that's basically corn, black beans and shredded chicken or pork mixed with rice.  Very healthy choices are abound on the menu and there is no lack of choices in general.  

The best thing about this place is that if the weather is cooperating you can take your food out to the expansive patio and watch all the rafting, zip lining and rock climbing activities going on right around the place."}
{"text":"LOVED the Farro Salad! It was a huge salad and well worth the price despite my initial reaction to a salad priced at $10+. It was filling and had well-paired toppings that added nice texture. 

The service was decent and we were able to get a table right away which is surprising because I've almost always seen a wait. We were able to sit outside under the shaded tarp area and get a nice view of the white water. 

The beer list was extensive and there was a lot for everyone. 

If you've got time to spare and aren't trying to get to rafting at a certain time, definitely stop here for a nice lunch. Despite higher prices than other eateries at the Center, this is good stuff."}
{"text":"Good food after a hike.  I had the veggie burger and it was really good.  The portions are big- even for salads.  Some complaints that I have from my experience on Friday are: 1) my husbands burger was burnt; 2) the service was really slow, despite it not being very busy at all; 3) the server seemed to be rushing us out after we let him know from the beginning that we were just wanting to relax and have some beers- before our friend showed up to join us the server had already brought our check.  We continued to order more beer anyway."}
{"text":"Awesome view, delicious beers, and good food at a reasonable price. Love spending lazy Sunday lunches here - grabbing a bite and enjoying the people & event watching."}
{"text":"Finished up a ride on the mt bike and headed over to the restaurant to grab a bite.  I did not set my expectations to high.  I was blown away at how good the food was.  The service was great, and the tall Blue Moon hit the spot.  I can't wait to go back. 

There are so many restaurants these days that are fair at best.  It is nice to know that there are still places to go where they really care about what they do, and have a great product."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise ... healthy alternatives, amazing beer selection and great views of the whitewater course.  We had some sweet potato waffle fries which were done nicely but topped with way too much salt.  Entrees included rare ahi tuna wrap and a brisket cheese steak.  The aioli with sundried tomatoes was marvelous!"}
{"text":"1We went to the center and met friends for dinner.
If your in a hurry please reconsider you restaurant choice. 
We sat for over 30 min just waiting to take our order. We then waited for another 30 min for our food.
 The manager came and spoke to us and basically called us liars. He spoke to the waitress and she gave him a story that didn't match ours. Really why would we lie.
 The service was terrible.  The food was cold after we got it and we ate in the dark. We used our cell phones for light.
  We will not be going back. And unless you have a couple hours to kill and aren't very hungry I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"If you have never been to the US National Whitewater Center, it is definitely worth a visit. The place is HUGE and offers an array of fun outdoor activities including a man-made whitewater course that is used to train hopeful Olympic kayakers, zip lines, obstacle courses, a huge rock wall, flatwater kayaking in the Catawba river, mountain biking and more. My stepdaughter recently spent a week at the Center's day camp and loved it - definitely the best day camp I have ever come across for active and adventurous kids!

A nice surprise is that there is a decent restaurant on site: River's Edge Bar & Grill is right by the whitewater course and offers a surprisingly diverse menu for this kind of place. Even if you aren't up to taking on the outdoor activities, you can come walk around and have a meal. There is a $5 parking fee which I was surprised about since there is plenty of room and you would not come there for any other reason! Concerts are offered frequently and there is a special July 4 celebration as well.

While attending the summer camp orientation we decided to check out the restaurant. I tried the tree hugger salad, below and enjoyed its Green Goddess dressing and roasted vegetables. The burrito was nothing special - kind of dry as was the hummus - but still better than what you usually get at a place where food is not the main objective. There are lots of things we didn't try - salmon, tuna and pasta are offered entrees and a multitude of sandwiches, other salads and appetizers are available as well. There are many vegetarian and vegan items. All in all, after a day of fun in the sun, River's Edge is a decent place to relax and take in the scenery."}
{"text":"Albeit we ate here during River Jam on a Thursday, but our table had all kinds of problems primarily with the food.  The pulled pork sandwich didn't come with everything the menu described, the burger was dry, and the chicken nachos were fine but difficult to mess up.  

This is really the only place for a 'sit-down dining' experience at the Whitewater Center, but most of us don't come for that so don't expect much if you have to eat there.  I feel bad for the server as it wasn't his fault, and he did keep apologizing.  For them, it was easier to keep bringing us our beers and hope we forget about the food quality."}
{"text":"Came here for a bite to eat before we embarked on our adventures. If you think you want something quick, please avoid. Food was so-so, nothing special, and the service was awful. Our party of 3 each ordered a sandwich, but I was somehow done eating my meal by the time the other two people got their food. Every transaction with the server took forever. Maybe they are understaffed, but it hardly seems so with a million uniformed people walking around. Not sure what is going on here."}
{"text":"I love going to the Whitewater Center on Thursday or Saturday night. During the summer they have River Jam with a different band playing each night. You can bring a chair or blanket and sit on the lawn but we like to get a table and eat while listening. It is right on the water so you can watch the rafters. They have a new Beergarten this year & have lots of craft beers on tap. This is a fun place to go, even if you just want to eat, drink & watch the show. The food is just standard fair but the atmosphere is fun. It's a great place to hang out!"}
{"text":"The food was really good but a bit over priced. I get that it's a the whitewater center but $14 for a chicken sandwich is a little much.  With that said, they had some good deals on beers and a great selection too! The service was just ok, the bartender wasn't the friendliest. Overall, it was a good meal though."}
{"text":"Had the $16 Ramen Bowl. It was 5 shrimp and a spoonful of ramen with a few slivers of mushroom and radish. Going to leave hungry! Expect a lot more for the price! Service is slow. Wife had the $12 lettuce wraps and will also be leaving hungry! Not what I expected at the WWC. If I wanted fruffy upscale micro food I would go downtown!"}
{"text":"Meh, my husband and I weren't impressed at all. I had the Orchard Chicken Sandwich with Sweet Potato fries. They were both room temp which just sucks. The sandwich had great flavor but needed more of the elements, not enough caramelized onions or apples. Husband liked Cowboy burger but seasoned fries were way over the top on seasoning. Good service, great atmosphere, bleh quality. If the quality was stepped up to excellence they'd have something great going!"}
{"text":"Very pet-friendly- sat on the patio with my two pits and enjoyed the beautiful afternoon. The buffalo chicken nachos were so good, I couldn't stop eating them. Was let down with the ahi tuna wrap, it was just too dry. I wouldn't drive out of my way to go eat there, but do recommend it if you are spending the day in the Whitewater Center."}
{"text":"BRING BACK THE OLD MENU!!!!! every thing took a jump in price, but a dive in quality! Come on! I used to LOVE the WWC, and knowing you could get a delicious meal out there was awesome. Please, please, please bring back the old menu! the new food doesn't even compare (the mac n cheese, for example-- used to be delicious white cheddar spirals... now it's mushy orange easy mac).. PLEASE!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good for pretty much the only food option on premise. Other surprise, it was relatively healthy options too! 

I kinda just guessed it would be all fried foods, maybe because it's the south, sorry I'm assuming. I got the Portobello Sandwich with peppers, onions,
balsamic on a wheat roll. See, they even upped the ante with a wheat bun! And it was good! The basil green beans were an excellent choice to round out my healthy meal!

Now back to sweating it out on the rope course! Crap, let's sweat out that beer I had too... whoops!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent.  Plenty of options from big burgers to salads and everything in between.  The two female bartenders are attentive, nice, and bust their humps to make sure everyone in their service is happy.  However, I have never had good service anywhere but at the bar.  Not once.  The wait-either to get a table or to receive our food-is always something along the lines of the entire cretaceous period.

 What is boils down to is that if you can get seated and get your food delivered hot, this place is great.  That can be a real challenge though.  The kitchen is undersized for the volume that comes through so the hostesses, servers, and all the other front line staff are constantly overwhelmed.  The hostesses are generally kind of clueless as well, which does not help.  Friends have managed to seat themselves in the midst of a \"two hour+ wait\" by simply plopping down at an empty table more than once.  

If you are eating here it is probably because you are visiting the WWC, so all I can say is plan your food consumption during your visit to avoid peak times and you will probably have a solid, three star dining experience at a reasonable price point.  Come during the rush and prepare to be miserable.

One last thing.  The beers on tap are always very well thought out and tasty.  They usually have local microbrews in addition to good ole standbys like Bells Two Hearted and Fat Tire as well as a very healthy selection of bottled beers.  The prices are pretty normal for a bar and the selection cant be beaten, short of places like the Pizza Peel and the Flying Saucer.  Probably this places biggest redeeming quality."}
{"text":"Foods ok. Bit expensive. 

There is a walkin cafe right to the right that is better without the wait."}
{"text":"We were there yesterday for the festivities (July 3) and most of the food was sub-par. 
My brother got fried pickles which were soggy.  Three of us got the dill potato salad...holy bland!  My husband got the turkey wrap and he said it was pretty blah. I got the Cuban...I never send food back but I had no choice. The sandwich had no sauce, and it was cold. It was like someone pulled it from the refrigerator and put it on the plate. The turkey and pork tasted like it was 6 days left over. The redo sandwich was warm and had a thousand island dressing, better but the ciabatta bread was not pressed or grilled and the meat still tasted like it was old. My daughter's pepperoni pizza was awesome!  I'll get that next time. My brother did enjoy his fish tacos.  I also found it was ridiculous they were not allowing kid snacks into the park. There isn't a lot to offer in the park for little ones and not to mention lines were 20-30 deep. Not cool!"}
{"text":"I'll be honest; I had pretty low expectations for River's Edge. Normally sit-down restaurants at theme parks just aren't very good. And they don't have to be since patrons don't have much choice with being locked in for the whole day. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by this place!

We went this past Sunday during Tuck Fest around 12:30. There was a short wait to be seated outside, but inside required no wait at all, so we opted for that. The porch seemed to have a lot more tables, with nice views of the surrounding whitewater center. The inside was surprisingly very clean, considering the kinds of activities offered here. Prices of dishes were also decent. And our waitress was very friendly and attentive. 

I ordered the Smokehouse plate. The whole dish was neatly plated. The pork belly was the right mix of fatty with just a touch of crispness to it that I love; the sausage was juicy and tender; and the brisket was flavorful and not drenched in BBQ sauce. The fries however were a little too salty.  Overall this place was good. Not the greatest food you'll eat, but definitely gets the job done. I would give this place 4.5 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Eh, its just okay. Most \"theme\" parks usually don't impress with the food, but the River's Edge is almost, almost an exception to that norm. 

The food is actually decent, but the service is a little s l o w. While prices are in line with other theme parks, the beer selection is pretty impressive. They offer everything from Fat Tire on tap to PBR tall boys. 

Burgers are decent; good quality patty and veggies, but nothing special and excessively tasty. Mac n cheese is pretty good. It isn't traditional southern mac n cheese, rather curly noodles topped with some type of extra cheesy white cheddar sauce. Kinda like mac n cheese nachos if you will.

The best part about the grill though is the location...but I guess that's a gimme. =)"}
{"text":"If you are hanging out at the White Water center and need food, you don't have many options. The food here is decent and timely. Typical selections of burgers, chicken fingers, some appetizers, a few other more sophisticated items. They have a decent craft beer selection. You definitely don't go here for the food, but its also a fine place to grab a bite while you are entertained with the atmosphere of the white water center. About half the tables overlook the water and that adds a little more atmosphere to the experience."}
{"text":"Had a couple of experiences here a the USNWWC.  The majority of them was just having a tall beer after a rough day of trail running.  My last visit involved ordering food so that's why I'm finally reviewing this place.

I had the hummus wrap and sweet potato fries.  Awesome wrap made out of freshly cut veggies and flavorful hummus.  The fries were a bit indulgent, but good (they are waffle style).

The servers and staff are friendly enough, though some seem to rather young and spacey.    I can only imagine how much fun having a job here would be during the summers with friends.  Take care of your customers first, then socialize (is my motto).... especially if I'm one of those customers!!!  

Overall this bar and grill works great with the WWC.  Love the fact you can sit outside and be all sweaty.... I have yet to go inside yet, but I'll save that for a day that I am not drenched in sweat (which will probably be never)."}
{"text":"Well..it usually takes between half an hour and an hour and a half to get your food, but in the middle of Whitewater I suppose that can be expected. Prices are fairly reasonable all things considered and the burgers are basically standard, but good."}
{"text":"Chubby or Skinny?

Those are your choices for the 'Fat Tire' draught beer at this water side watering hole.

Take a break  and enjoy a cold brew. The Fat Tire is a Belgium style brew which is very refreshing after a day of white water rafting.

The Skinny is 16oz's ...the Chubby upgrades you to 24 oz's of brewed goodness in a clear 'take me home' plastic cup.

You get a great view of the 1,200 foot zip line as zippers speed over the white water below.

They also have a nice outside deck for those who enjoy a breath of fresh air with their 'Chubby'."}
