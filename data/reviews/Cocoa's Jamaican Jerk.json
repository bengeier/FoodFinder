{"text":"My food was \"okay\". My curry chicken was a little on the dry side, I expected more from this restaurant. On the plus side, They have good service, it's family owned and food didn't take too take long to prepare. 

I'm just hoping we came at a bad time and the food can be better."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch and ordered the jerk pork, it came with rice & peas and cabbage. This is very basic Jamaican food. The jerk pork is dry and bland, no seasoning at all. Sorry it's not authentic. The rice & peas has no color or flavor. I'm Jamaican so I know what it should taste like. 

Advice : if you go for LUNCH they automatically charge you a dinner price if you don't say I want the lunch portion.  I was charged $2 extra for something I didn't ask for, nor was I given the option. 

The patties were good. Service was fast, portion size was generous, but the food just wasn't great."}
{"text":"I saw this place featured on television and was so excited and very eager to try the food. So I decided to order oxtail for my husband and fried snapper for dinner. I was salivating and couldn't wait to try my $22 fried snapper because I felt It would be worth the money. I was highly disappointed. My husband barely made it through this meal, I could tell he was not enjoying it at all. As for my snapper dish it was fried too hard, drenched in sauce which saturated my rice, and the curry cabbage was over cooked,  i wanted to cry. My combined meal came to over $50. I started making excuses that maybe the chef was having a bad day. So I said to myself, I should give them another chance. I went back on Sunday 6/10/18 and ordered another snapper and was given the same disappointing meal. I believe in giving someone a second chance to redeem themselves but I still was not impressed at all. I don't think I will be going back in the future."}
{"text":"Okay, I am going to be very honest here and hopefully my opinion will be respected. First off I will start with the GOOD....Great Customer Service...The BAD..... I went to this establishment shortly after they opened this year. When I first went in, I ran into a angry customer who said that the Jerk Chicken was horrible and wanted her money back. Caused a BIG disturbance which prompted them call the Police on her, meanwhile offered to give me free samples of everything until my food was done. Which I obliged thinking that it would all be good. Not the case. Rice and peas was not Caribbean, the Jerk wings were just fried wings with jerk sauce put on them. The Jerk Chicken tastes like smoked chicken with jerk sauce poured on it. My Mom is from the Islands and I cook all the Yard food from scratch. This place is really not that good and frankly do not know how they stay in business. To each its own on the other opinions here, however I COOK so I know how the food should be. Nevertheless, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Bought the beef patty and coco bread along with a curry shrimp dinner. The good was okay. The beef patty was burnt on the bottom and the coco bread was rubbery. I would advise not to get those 2 things. The curry shrimp was good. Would like a bit more seasoning and layers to the seasoning. For a quick meal this okay. The drinks were okay genuine Jamaican drinks. Being from NYC I may be a bit biased because the Caribbean food in NYC is extremely authentic."}
{"text":"Experienced this restaurant for the first time for lunch and I was very pleasantly surprised. First of all, when I pulled up I saw a smoker outside in the parking lot. That made me feel like they are doing things right. The customer service is great. They made me feel like family from the moment I walked in.  They took time to explain some menu options to me and informed me that they use 38 ingredients to create the jerk recipe. Then they bnb gave us samples of jerk chicken, brown stew chicken and curry chicken. They even explained what ordered to eat them in. All of the samples were delicious. The jerk chicken could be the best in the city. The smoky flavor is undeniable. The brown stew chicken is amazing as well. We ordered 1 of each. The large platters were enough for two meals. I'm a big boy, I put away some food and I couldn't finish it. I look forward to trying everything on the menu. Instantly a favorite spot for the family."}
{"text":"Authentic flavorful. Price is reasonable. Could omit the roll and give more cabbage on the curry shrimp dinners."}
{"text":"I love authentic and Cocoa's is exactly that! I have tried their Curry Goat, Oxtails, Jerk Chicken, Plantains and beef patties. Cocoa (she's the owner) cares that her creations are true to her Ghana? roots and takes the time and effort (there is a wood smoker on site) to impart her passion and know how to every dish.

This is the best Caribbean style restaurant in the area. Definitely worth the visit."}
{"text":"I was so happy to see a Jamaican restaurant open so close to my neighborhood.  It's located in Davis Lake behind the KFC.  The owners are great, and allowed me to sample several items before deciding.  I tried the brown stew chicken, jerk chicken, and curry chicken....none of them tasted authentic, they weren't bad, just not what I consider Jamaican.  I ordered the 'curry' chicken, rice and peas, and cabbage.  I will say that the rice and peas were good, everything else was ok, again not Jamaican in my opinion."}
{"text":"The food was poorly seasoned. I ordered the oxtails. They were tough and chewy. The cabbage wasn't good either"}
{"text":"Really really good and HUGE portions. Will definitely be back to try something else. (Had the spicy jerk chicken today.)"}
{"text":"Definitely Good Home Cooking and it was a Blend of West Indian Soul Food. The Fish was prepared different than how I grew up. And the Prices for Patties and Side were too high. But, The Owner and Workers are Extremely Friendly, and Provide Good Service."}
{"text":"I would really like to give this place 3.5 stars but sadly, their super hyped Jamaican Jerk Chicken, although very good, is not Jerk Chicken. I will admit, I am not Jamaican and so it is possible that I don't know what true Jerk chicken is; however, I have had a good deal of jerk chicken in my day. 
Their chicken is tender and you can taste the slightly smoky flavor of the bbq, which I like. It is well seasoned and seems to be marinated/cooked in some type of chimichurri based sauce but not jerk seasoning.
The rice and peas are more like parboiled rice with red kidney beans. 
The order if chicken came with cooked cabbage and a potato roll. It was a generous portion for $8.99. I also ordered some plantains, beef patties and veggie patties. The plantains were undercooked, as another yelper mentioned. The patties, however, were really good.
The service was friendly although slightly aloof and the wait was about 15 minutes ( I imagine the chicken was just coming off the grill as most places have it already prepared and pack up orders right away). 
There is some seating inside and reggae music videos are being continuously played for your entertainment.
Overall, I will definitely return for the patties and to try some of their other dishes (maybe oxtail or curry goat). I might even get more chicken so long as I am not specifically after the traditional \"jerk\" flavor."}
{"text":"Waited forever for my food. They didn't tell me that there was no more cabbage. A drunk guy outside causing trouble. I'll never ever come back. My oxtails was cold. The food is not all that great."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I just finished our first experience from Cocoa's.  We had our meals delivered through Door Dash, and the food arrived promptly, well packaged, and hot.  While she ordered the Salted Cod-Ackee, rice & peas, and cabbage dinner, I ordered the Spicy Jerk Pork, rice & peas, and cabbage dinner.  We also got a side order of callaloo and two beef patties.  I have been to Jamaica before, and am familiar with the ingredients, spices and techniques used in Jamaican food, so I was anxious to try Cocoa's and see how they measured up.  Overall, I had a mixed experience, with the following pros and cons:

Pros:
*The food was made and delivered quickly, and exactly as ordered (and at peak dinner time on a Friday evening-nice job !)
*The meat pies were delicious, and tasted fresh
*The cabbage was tasty, spiced adequately, and tender
*The jerk pork was tender, and lots of it (but SALTY!-see below) 
*Portion sizes were certainly generous, leaving plenty of leftovers

Cons:
*The salt content in almost everything, but especially the jerk pork, was overwhelming.  Seriously, if you have high blood pressure like I do, or are on a sodium-restricted diet, you need to think twice about eating this food.  While takeout food served in America is notoriously heavy-handed with the sodium, this was genuinely distracting. I strongly suggest that Cocoa's not mistake 'salty' for 'flavorful'.  Believe me, they're two different things ! 
*I ordered 'Spicy' (because I like it hot!) and the pork was not that hot, and for me there wasn't enough of the fresh allspice taste that is found in truly authentic jerk.  

Would I eat here again ?  Possibly, but I would probably try something else, or maybe stick to the meat pies. I think Cocoa's is promising, but seriously, go easier on the salt.  People can always add more on their own if it needs it."}
{"text":"This was our first time ordering from Cocoa's. I am new to Jamaican food but my boyfriend is not. I got the Salted-Cod Ackee and he got the Spicy Jerk Pork. Both were from the dinner menu so it was costly. We also got two meat pies and a side of callaloo. Overall, the portion sizes were generous for the cost. Everything was very flavorful; however, the pork, cabbage and callaloo had way too much salt. So much so that we could not finish those. The cod, rice and peas and meat pies were perfectly seasoned and we ate those up! I would definitely go back but maybe only for lunch. The dinner prices are high but overall the food was good."}
{"text":"I ran into the owner a few weeks before she was going to open and knew just from our conversation that she was the real deal and the food was going to be fantastic! I finally got in to try it out and it was all I expected and more!!!"}
{"text":"CLOSE THIS PLACE DOWN i only gave it 1 star because i had to if it was up to me they wouldn't get a star. Food had no seasoning planktons was burnt rice was hard! Save your money!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this Resturant!!!! Authentic!!! The curry chicken!!! Whaaaaattttt!!!! OMG get over there right now!!! The owners are wonderful and the samples are amazing!"}
{"text":"This review is mostly based on the food. They only have a few tables inside and do not offer table service. it seems like it's mostly set up for takeout orders. While we were there many people came in for take out. The staff is very friendly and helpful in picking menu items. They offer an all you can eat Jamaican chicken variety dinner (Jerk Chicken, Curry Chicken and Brown-Stew Chicken) for $17.99. The food is nothing short of outstanding! The Brown-Stew Chicken is very flavorful and delicious! The Curry Chicken is very good. The Jerk Chicken is not very spicy but very flavorful! They make their own jerk seasoning with whole herbs. The Curry Goat is to die for! My friend has been to Jamaica many times and he said the food is better than the food that he had in Jamaica!In short, this is the best Jamaican food that I've ever had in Charlotte! Wow!"}
{"text":"Stumbled on this spot 2 weeks ago and I've been back 3 times since. The jerk chicken is excellent!! Not a fan of cabbage but the collards are great and I saw a woman almost drop to her knees over the potato salad tonight lol...owner is a sweetheart. Portion sizes are reasonable. Try it out and I'm sure you'll be back"}
{"text":"First time eating Cocoa's this evening. I had the spicy Curry Goat with rice and peas and cabbage (it also came with a roll).

Pros: 
-The goat was very tender and seasoned well.
-The spiciness was perfect. Not too hot but just the right amount of \"burn\" on my lips
-The flavor actually tastes like Caribbean curried meat and not Indian curry like I've tasted at a nearby restaurant.
-The staff are very friendly. Two men who looked like cooks were outside on a break and they both greeted me before I even got to the door which is awesome. The lady at the register was very sweet as well. 

Cons
-Cabbage is bland. No veggies in it either which is how I've always had Caribbean style cabbage so it's weird to me that there was literally only pieces of cabbage and nothing else.
-As you can see from my picture, Portions are small. I got the dinner size for $15.... FIFTEEN DOLLARS...for half a plate of food... I was not happy about that when she opened the plate for me to see it before she bagged it. $15 is steep period, even for goat. I order goat often when I go to Caribbean spots and this is by far the most expensive yet the least amount of food. They should really consider lowering the price or putting more food on the plate. 


I'll be returning in the near future to try some of the other dishes because it tastes really good, but definitely will not order the goat again only because it costs so much for so little."}
{"text":"Excellent service with a smile! Food is delicious and priced fairly as it is a large portion given. The curry chicken is AMAZING! Love the sides too! One of my fave places to eat in University area."}
{"text":"I've wanted to try this place and finally had the opportunity! I ordered my food to go. The vibe inside is nice, but basic decor. I wasn't familiar with the menu so the cashier offered me a sample. I declined because I don't eat chicken. (They are primarily known for jerk chicken) I ordered the shrimp curry with the veggies and a side of Mac and cheese. I had to wait around 15 minutes, but I did not mind. The food was hot and very good! I ordered a large plate and it was enough to share with my friend. We both enjoyed! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"On the outside it looks like a lovely mom and pops. BUT I ASSURE YOU ITS NOT, THE OWNER IS CRAZILY RUDE AND DISRESPECTFUL, STEER FAR AWAY. I took my wife here for lunch and she ordered the jerk chicken sandwich, the 2nd bite she pulled a roach out of her teeth. Please do not visit this restuarant."}
{"text":"Tried the oxtails as I do with any new Caribbean spot, and I must say everything was horrible. Oxtails were tough and just tasted ugh. Cabbage was hard, undercooked and unseasoned and rice was dry and bland. Money wasted, I trashed it all. The young lady at the counter asked if I wanted coco bread with my meal and I said yes thinking it came with it. Ending up paying $3.50 for a dinner roll. Won't be visiting again."}
{"text":"The Coconut bread was very hard, not light and fluffy as it was verbally advertised to me and my wife. I was very disappointed. The food was mediocre at best. In the age of Trump and all of this racism at these white establishments, I'm trying to patronize black businesses more. But my people are making it so, so hard. The Microwave should not be your most important asset in your business. The Collards were possible can greens, definitely not fresh Collards. Mac and Cheese lack cheese. Ox tails and rice were ok. Cabbage was the only thing that was good. These two very small plates were $32.00 way to expensive for the quality. I will continue to search for good black restaurants, but I won't be coming back to Coco's"}
{"text":"Man, i really wanted this place to be good. I was so disappointed. The jerk chicken was decent and the service was pretty good which is why I gave it two stars. However, everything else was all bad! First off it's extremely overpriced. I got two jerk chicken meals, a side of plantain (bc they give you a damn roll instead of plantain) and 1 drink...it was $31. I believe in paying for good food but this just wasn't good. The rice tasted old, hard, and stale and the cabbage...oh boy the cabbage smh. It had noooooo flavor! I wanted to take the second meal back so bad. The Caribbean restaurants in Charlotte really need to step it up."}
{"text":"This was not authentic at all! I didn't taste any Jamaican seasonings except for what seemed to be curry in the cabbage. The oxtails were tough and the peas in the rice and  were not done! Can't believe it was $17.00! The food was as if it was cooked because it had to be done, not because someone loved to cook and wanted people to enjoy their food.  On the positive side, my Ting was refreshing as always!"}
{"text":"Ok guys, so when you decide to try this place, prepare to be AMAZED!!! We've been to a few different Caribbean spots around the city, one of them being directly across the street from Cocoa's! When I tell y'all this is top notch Caribbean cuisine, believe me! We stopped in on a Friday night around 8p and there were a few people in line ordering. We had a chance to look the menu over, which isn't extensive, but I find that to be a good thing. I'm wary of restaurants with a huge menu because I'm concerned that they may be a jack of all trades but a master of none. I ordered the curry chicken and my husband ordered the jerk chicken. I should've known the jerk chicken would've been serious when we saw the huge smoker outside that the chicken is slow-cooked in. The restaurant was clean and inviting and the cashiers were friendly. They're reasonably priced, comparable to other Caribbean restaurants in town. We got home and had no idea what we were in for!! Our chicken was cooked PERFECTLY!! Like, fall off the bone perfection! You could really taste the smoky flavor of the jerk chicken and my curry chicken was delish! The dishes come with a side of red beans and rice (which that refer to as rice and peas), greens, and a roll. I'm not a fan of vinegar in my greens and these had a good amount of vinegar in them so I'll substitute for something else next time. I would recommend this spot to anyone!! And they're even open until 11p on Fridays and Saturdays!! Check it out and you'll be in love!!"}
{"text":"The food was first poorly seaoned, then it was over seasond with pepper sauce the 2nd time i went back to return this food. What a waste. These people think that just because this is charlotte,nc that west indians arent down here and know what good west indain food is. EXTREMELY HOT! Beyond the stanards of what quality is. Please cross them off the list. I will can only endorse 
CARRIBEAN HUT ON NORTH TRYON!  There consistently consistent! 

Pros, the food portions were good, and they tried to make it feel cozy inside i guess."}
{"text":"Nice staff but the food was NOT good.  Chicken was bland, rice was dry and the pattie was dry as hell (tasted like a frozen pattie found at a local grocery store).  As much as I wanted to like this restaurant, unfortunately I won't be returning"}
{"text":"Would never eat here, dirty and awful"}
{"text":"Okay so I tried this place because it was close to my house and the old Caribbean place I used to try has really fallen off with the quality of their food. Well this place was no better. 

First of all the cocoa bread tasted like a regular roll. Nothing more. Nothing less. 

I ordered the fried tilapia. Was not seasoned well at all. Had to drown it in hot sauce when I got home. The Mac and cheese was just okay. The collard greens had a little too much vinegar.

And they charge 10.50 for a fried tilapia plate with one piece of fish. The extra piece of fish was $4.00 extra. Way too overpriced!!! My meal including that fake cocoa bread was $20! Never again!!!!"}
{"text":"If you're trying to figure out where you can feed two people from one plate, then this is the place. I'd saw signs along Harris Blvd. but never realized how close I was to this location. After seeing the smoke coming from the grill, I decided to give myself a break from cooking and try it out. I was immediately greeted and the cashier was ready to take my order. The inside of the restaurant looks like a beginner mom-n-pop place, it was fairly clean and had good music playing.

I started to order a small plate of jerk chicken and a side, my total was about $16 (woah)...I wasn't expecting that price. I opted out of the side since I'm sure I'll visit them again. Granted, I received a lot of food for it to be a \"small\" plate but while I may eat like I'm two people... it's just me. It took about 7 minutes for my order to be ready so that was a bonus, since I was told that everything was made that day. The plate was heavy so I'd already made up in my mind that I was also going to have lunch for the next day. 

After I got home, sat down and excitedly ate a piece of chicken, the spice bounced off my tongue, out my mouth and slapped me in the face. I did get spicy jerk chicken, but it was extremely hot so I may go for mild next time. The rice and peas were \"okay\" but the cabbage was good. Overall, it made for a good Sunday dinner and Monday lunch! Not to mention, the next day I received a coupon from them to use on my next visit (side note: they use Square which automatically emails my receipt and the coupon was sent to the same email). 

I say check them out, be mindful of the prices but not too shabby, not to shabby at all!"}
{"text":"This was not at all what I was expecting, especially since the owner talked it up so much smh. Although, considering the other Caribbean options in Charlotte, I shouldn't have expected much. The only positive note is the jerk chicken. Despite it not having the typical jerk flavour, they did a good job of seasoning the meat so it wasn't bland. The escovitch fish was...well it just was not escovitch. It was more of a tomato stewed fish which was weird to say the least. The fried plantains were undercooked so we had to toss them in the oven when we got home to avoid getting sick from eating raw plantains.

They were also grossly overpriced. Two meals cost us $40! Safe to say we won't be returning."}
