{"text":"I honestly believe that there is a strong chance I will dream of my Mushroom BBQ sandwich tonight.  I am so glad that there are people in this world, such as the genius responsible for my sandwich today, capable of creating the awesomeness I was fortunate enough to stuff my face with.  It's awful that the public market will be closing February 28th, and I can only hope that I will either be able to visit as much as possible prior to said day, or that Steve's deli will find a new home.  I'm really banking on the latter.  But you only tried one menu item you say??  I have no doubts about that being an insignificant fact.  I am not a gambler, at all, but would think it safe to wager on the rest of the menu being just as phenomenal.   Fine.. Maybe I will go back tomorrow, with company, and we will eat until we are sick, and possibly take photos for you to drool over before devouring every last scrumptious morsel.  You don't scare me.  Do yourself a favor, and get there.. Now. Or at least before the 28th.  The sooner you go, the more you'll be able to constantly eat their food from heaven as well."}

{"text":"The charlatans over at Subway who call themselves Sandwich Artists are unworthy to lick the boots of Ed at Steve's Deli!   During a weekend trip to Pittsburgh my husband and I spent our Sunday meandering around the Strip District - basically eating our way through the town - and by divine circumstance stumbled into the Pittsburgh Public Market, home of (among many other lovely things), Steve's Deli.   This place is not messing around! A simple, clean prep area with minimalist decor and two stools is the scene where we ate the two best sandwiches we have ever had:  - The Pork Sandwich: Pressure cooked pork sandwich with ground cherries, feta, molasses, parsley, coriander, and seasoned creme fraiche. This sandwich is a work of art and an homage to the humble pig who laid down its life for my lunch.  - Lamb: We also tried the day's special, an audacious Smoked Lamb, cheese, and cranberry compote melange on baguette. Ed carefully carved each bite-size bit of lamb from a house smoked leg in front of our very eyes.   We watched counterside as Ed lovingly created both sandwiches and laid them out on crisp white butcher paper for presentation. The whole affair probably took somewhere between 5-10 minutes of careful work and it was as exquisite to watch as it was to taste!   As Steve's is a relatively new venture, I hope that folks in Pittsburgh will seek it out so that it may receive accolades it deserves as an exemplar of the art of sandwich-making that it is!"}
