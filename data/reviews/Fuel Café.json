{"text":"I popped in during the afternoon for a bit to eat and a pop. It was dead and there was only one girl working. She was cleaning and stocking and getting ready to close. I asked for a slice of pizza and she went to heat it up right away. The pizza is either made else where or just earlier in the day. It was fine for being in a hotel as a small eating place.  They do have some awesome donuts but they only make them for a few hours in the morning.  The girl was fast and offered me cheese or red pepper for my pizza which was nice.  She wasn't super friendly but she was obviously trying to go home which I can understand. It was okay. Convenient if your staying at the Hardrock paradise tower and don't want to go all the way to the other side of the casino."}
{"text":"Nothing great, but if it is the only place near your hotel, worth a short walk.  They do not have almond milk, only soy.  The espresso is good, but the drink was tepid and prepared very quickly (there was a long line).  I would assume under different circumstances (not CES), this would be a better stop.  Overall an average experience.  They did have food and smoothies, but there wasn't much vegan fare."}
{"text":"I've eaten plenty of pizza in my time and this is the absolute worst pizza I have ever eaten!  (This does include the frozen ones you get at the grocery)  doubt its even real cheese they use, tasted like plastic. Complained in the hotel survey and didn't even get a response. I guess they figure they'll just shear the sheep that come in from out of town. I am local, and I care....."}
{"text":"DO NOT GET COFFEE HERE, I REPEAT. DO NOT GET COFFEE HERE.  I'm sorry, I am from Seattle and I love GOOD coffee.  We were staying at the Hard Rock for our honeymoon and paid a visit one morning to the Fuel Café because we both wanted coffee.  THERE WAS NO COFFEE IN MY LATTE, and my husband's drink tasted like garbage.  I spent $12+ on 2 shi**y drinks, which contained NO COFFEE.  My \"hazelnut latte with an EXTRA shot of espresso\", tasted like WARM CHOCOLATE MILK, with NO COFFEE.  We had to leave the hotel to get real coffee.  The server was also extremely rude, the only rude experience we encountered during our entire stay at the Hard Rock."}
{"text":"I love Fuel Cafe! Their green tea latte is absolutely awesome! I always ask to make it medium sweet, it has perfect taste."}
{"text":"When we needed a quick food on the go place, this was where we went every morning. They had coffee, juice and drinks as well. There were sandwiches, breads, fruit and snacks to have if you wanted as well. The yummy treats that my girlfriend and I enjoyed were the red velvet waffle and the chocolate waffle. Made fresh and delicious to have quickly in the mornings! :) Also had the Thai Chicken wrap, which was on the sweet side, but still good nonetheless. Their iced coffee was really good as well! Great place to get a quick bite to eat!"}
{"text":"Just sucks! I've never had this experience in my life .Such a no manner staff. Make me so upset from morning! Unbelievably stupid  attitude for customers. I can see this company does not give any education for staff.  Also they didn't prepare oven so they asked me wait 15min for my sandwiches. I waited for more than 25 min there. Just don't go to this place. I have to put 1 star but for real this place is lower than -5 star!!!"}
{"text":"I feel the Yelp reviews of Fuel Café are too harsh.  Fuel Café is what it is, a convenient coffee café in Paradise Tower where you can get a damn tasty if not healthy sandwich, or a bagel, or a salad without going out into noise of the Casino.    Yes it is not cheep, and they run out of things when there is more demand than anticipated.  You do want them to stay in business and pay their employees, right?  Their bagels are brought in from somewhere in a big bag, and they are pretty standard bagels, nothing special.  The Turkey Club sandwich toasted is yummy, but not healthy.  The ham croissant has a brie style soft cheese and is pretty tasty too.  The muffaletta is too salty for my taste, but if you like muffaletta, as my husband does, go for it!    The GREAT thing about Fuel Café is their people.   Whoever does their hiring has a great eye for happy personable people.   Different faces every year, but consistently bright and friendly.  I look forward to coming here in the morning every AVN..."}
{"text":"We wanted to grab some breakfast to go and we wanted something \"healthier\" so we decided to get a wildberry smoothie and açaí bowl. We paid about 20 bucks for that and I really wanted some good food.  The smoothie was just some crushed ice and a sirup - it was so fucking sweet and not a real fruit in it. The açaí bowl was a joke too. Vanilla ice, crushed ice, and with some coconut flakes (that was the only healthy stuff) on it and OF COURSE açaí sirup....  Fucking expensive, not real food, server was mean too. I RATHER WOULD LIKE TO GIVE THEM 0 STARS"}
{"text":"4 stars because the java was pretty good. === === === ===  This little cafe is located in the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino, so it's the go-to place when you wake up and are looking for that morning caffeine boost. Luckily, it's not too bad. I had a french vanilla cappuccino and a plain bagel with cream cheese.   It's noting to write home about, but it was pretty good. The place was clean. The staff was friendly. The prices were unremarkable and to be expected for Vegas. The seating area was limited, so first-come, first-served or just grab and go."}
{"text":"Shame, shame, shame....I was not expecting much, but my food was laughably inedible and threw it away after forcing 5 sips and bites down for nourishment...if you could even call it that.   I was in Hard Rock and didn't want or have time to sit down and eat, so being summer decided a smoothie sounded refreshing and decided to grab a toasted bagel to go with it.  There is no where else casual in Hard Rock.  My \"smoothie\" was worse than a 7/11 slurpee and tasted like bad frozen koolaid, disgusting.  They made it out of a box mix without even a fresh banana in it.  The bagel was dry, brittle cardboard....come on, I mean at least make it edible.  I was too mad to even complain."}
{"text":"Out of two coffees, one was fine and the other came out tasting burnt and disgusting. Staff was lackadaisical, not sure why I tipped at all if you're going to set my drink on the counter furthest away from where I'm sitting and not even call my name-- I don't expect you to walk out to me necessarily, but if I am literally your only customer and you can't be bothered to do the bare minimum, maybe you shouldn't be open."}
{"text":"This place sucks. Bagel with butter or cream cheese means you have to put in on yourself. So the pricey fee for a bagel must be for all their manual labor. Not. I waited 15 minutes for a plain bagel. Unacceptable."}
{"text":"Great breakfast...Great coffee, breakfast sandwiches, perfect in the morning after a late night.  Staff are super friendly...."}
{"text":"Wow. You could dominate with a place like this. Instead it just sucks. Too long to make drinks, bad food. Mediocre service. The best I can say is it's coffee when you need it."}
{"text":"Avoid this crappie hole! At first it looks like a nice little joint then you get your food and serve neither one were on point! The food and service was terrible! First the girl gave us a salad that was in the display cabinet and it sitting out all day and the lettuce was Brown! Then they were out of the Caesar dressing for the Caesar salad! Then I ordered the cucumber sandwich and the bread was hard as a rock!"}
{"text":"So, no whipped cream for my Espresso con Pan.  Settled for a double shot of espresso and half and half (no, not even real cream).  Espresso almost tasted burned.  It was not a good experience."}
{"text":"Besides the price of the drinks, it's a cute little coffee shop that gets the job done. The java chip ice blended was pretty good and had a good amount of chips in the drink. Starbucks, I feel, tends to go a little chip crazy and I end up having tiny espresso pieces all throughout my mouth and this place doesn't do that =)  I also got an ice blended green tea, which was pretty big...probably due to the price ($6.50?) and could've been better. By the time I got towards 3/4 of my drink, it was like I was drinking watered down green tea. Their offer your typical baked goods and I have to say their fruit parfait was probably the best I've ever had. It was loaded with tons of fruit that you can't even see and they used Greek yogurt, so the consistency was nice and thick, instead of runny."}
{"text":"Standard coffee bar but with an amazing twist - fresh made hot mini doughnuts!!! A dozen is only $5!! Perfect quick snack and coffee to start the morning (or afternoon since it is Vegas)!"}
{"text":"Arrived late into Vegas and needed some food.  Stopped by here on the way up to the hotel room and got an egg and sausage breakfast sandwich with cheese.  Was greasy and small and pricey, but OK in terms of taste.  Definitely would have enjoyed it more if it wasn't so greasy!"}
{"text":"The Service was bellow my expectations. So I was at the hotel for the weekend and we decided to get coffee, bagels and oatmeal for breakfast. We were one of the first one to get in line and the cashier was amiable. The bad part was when the other lady made our order. The iced coffee that I got was more water than anything!! And I told her and she asked me if what I said was true about the coffee and I told her that she needs to make me a new one but instead a frappe. So she did and she also burned our bagels! So it took her a long time for our order and she also gave us an attitude. I'm never coming to this coffee shop ever again."}
{"text":"Service, attitude, and quality is terrible. On both occasions that my friends and I visited, there was no coffee in multiple drinks-I watched the baristas make the drink with only milk and syrup-and a 16oz hot coffee cup was halfway filled. Sandra and another female employee from the day before were rude and impatient with most of the guests up until the line shortened."}
{"text":"Why do I need to show an ID for a 7 purchase????  That's ridiculous. Also the chocolate  croissant was flat and had almost no chocolate. The food in the window should either be plastic or preserved so it doesn't look so unappetizing. I guess when you are in a hotel that has conferences you don't need to care about customers since they are always revolving."}
{"text":"Our experience consisted of a couple black coffees, a bagel and a muffin.  Not too hard to screw that up, but they actually did a little (toasted the bagel when we asked that it NOT be).  It was packed in the morning, but there were enough tables and they were quick. I didn't even find the prices too out of whack (especially being in a Casino).  It is a good stop for that caffeine infusion!"}
{"text":"Cool coffee shop in the lobby of the Hard Rock. It's a little overpriced but it's good and it's convienant if you aren't driving while in town. They have coffee, lattes, cappachinos, etc. They also have breakfast options like burritos, sandwiches, etc.  They have some seating inside as well as right outside the cafe."}
{"text":"You will find two Fuel Cafe location's in the Hard Rock Hotel Walk way strip to both Casino Tower, and second right before the elevators of the Paradise elevator. I have only been to the location outside the Paradise tower, so the review is based on that. The cafe has a nice assortment of both cold and warm beverages... Think Starbucks with Pizza and Energy Drinks (And double the price). I have had the Egg white burritos a few different times which are always delicious, but they are pre cooked.  I saw the pizza sign before going into the Pool and said that looks gross, of course after leaving the pool I had to have a slice, it was decent nothing special. Every time I come to this location Customer Service is never anything spectacular, the people always have crumby looks on there face as if they hate there job and don't want to be there. IF I worked outside a pool cafe I would have a HUGE cheesier, and give best customer service to rack up some tips from the tipsy party people leaving the pool.   I well return because its convenient, and if things change ill update."}
{"text":"Lots of seating and a varied menu. As many reviewers have noted the prices are pretty high. There are plenty of sweet treats but by the afternoon a lot of the selection is gone.  Waffles are delicious but they only make one at a time, so be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"As far as I'm aware, this is one of the only places at the Hard Rock that offers tea. Culinary Drop Out and Mr. Lucky's don't serve none of that, FYI.  I came here twice to get my tea fix. It's $2.60 for a 12 oz cup, which I suppose is reasonable. Actually, the prices here aren't as inflated as cafes at other resorts. I can't comment on the food; though, the pre-packaged offerings didn't look appetizing.   Service wasn't as bad as others have experienced. The cafe was full of patrons when I came here in the morning, making it not the ideal place to quickly grab something to eat and drink and then head off. Might want to go elsewhere for that."}
{"text":"Good coffee, on par with Starbucks, a bit pricey, but hey, that's Vegas for you. Good choice if you are staying at or near the Hard Rock."}
{"text":"Came in and it was empty. Had 3 people to help and give suggestions. A yummy donuts (6 cream filled - your choice of chocolate, raspberry or cream) with a coffee for $7. Perfect to hold me over til dinner time. Had the iced chai tea latte with soy milk and added a shot for an extra boost. Yum!  Thanks for a great experience while we waited to go to our dinner at 5. Plenty of food options too if you don't want a donut. Oh and yelp said they were closed until 5pm, but I was happily surprised that they were open."}
{"text":"Excellent staff! Great crew of people work there. The selection of coffees is solid, along with some food and juice options. Why 2 stars:   No earl grey? Seriously? Tea isn't taken seriously at this shack."}
{"text":"If you are staying at the Hard Rock Hotel and get placed int the Paradise Tower this is your closest eatery. It's an alright choice for some quick bagels and coffee. There were also hot sandwiches available but of course the one I wanted was sold out. Um it was only 9:30 so that's not cool.    You can also pick up some muffins, juices, energy drinks, and waters if you need to hydrate. Service was OK, nothing special. Expect lines."}
{"text":"Super overpriced but I had a casino comp and $15 got me  a shitty breakfast sandwich and a tasty vanilla latte."}
{"text":"I never thought I would find myself saying this, but the coffee and food here is WAY better than Starbucks. The cashier was friendly and our order came out fast. I had the egg white burrito. While on the \"lite\" side (calorie wise) it was very filling. For my coffee I had the iced caramel macchiato. Personally, I think it could use more coffee, but it was delicious. My son enjoyed his eggless. Which is just a double sausage and cheese sandwich."}
{"text":"Stopping by at 10 pm for a caffeinated beverage does you no good - even as the hours are listed that they close at 11pm :("}
{"text":"Lots of coffee & espresso options.  The mocha is okay, the latte is not very good.  The pastries/desserts look like they came from a gas station.  They are really quick, which I appreciate.  I wish they would offer almond milk as an alternative to the soy & dairy options."}
{"text":"The coffee is great, and the breakfast burrito was okay. I don't think the hours posted here are correct though. I went at 5:15 desperate for coffee, and it was not yet open. The employee said 5:30, and the website says 7:00. Probably not an issue for most folks in Las Vegas. ;)"}
{"text":"I was going to meet my brother at the Hard Rock Hotel Starbuck's. Three months ahead of Christmas there was a surprise. Hard Rock Hotel replaced Starbuck's with the Fuel Cafe. Hours later when I needed a serious caffeine boost, I tried a Fuel Cafe ice blended coffee.    After a few sips, I missed Starbuck's. The nicest way that I could put it is that the $6 and change ice blended coffee is worth a $1. I passed over drinking it all. The taste was especially bitter and there was too much air in the cup. It tasted like putting a cup of cold Folger's coffee in a blender. If it was reasonably priced I still would pass over purchasing it in the future. Fuel Cafe's high prices are testimony that Starbuck's is not the highest price coffee shop.    I am a compassionate Yelper.  When writing this review I weighed in on service and other factors to avoid a one star bomb. The barista was hard working, did her best and was friendly.In the Hard Rock Hotel, I am captive. Ordinary coffee is better than no coffee when the party is over and fatigue creeps in. The extended hours are appreciated. My brother's coffee cup said Illy, and he said it was good. Maybe if there is a next time at Fuel Cafe, I will be satisfied with the drip.  Review in a nutshell:  Pros: Late hours, convenient for Hard Rock Hotel guests, good service.  Cons: Expensive, one star ice blended coffee drinks, replaced Starbuck's."}
{"text":"Pretty good coffee drinks using Illy.  Not that jacked up of a price considering that it's Illy & in the hotel.  But service can be slow.  My friend waited for her breakfast sandwich for at least 20 minutes and clearly they forgot about her.  My turkey pesto sandwich with cheese didn't look like a bagel sandwich in the display case but it was.  It was pretty dry and bland sadly.  Just come here to get coffee."}
{"text":"Do not even think about coming to this \"cafe\". First I tried to order an Italian wrap, which they were out of, So I asked for a turkey wrap which was old and mushy... My friend ordered a Caesar salad and they were out of caesar dressing and the only other choice was ranch. The ranch was sour and my wrap had old sprouts on it which had started to turn brown.  Seems this place bulk orders everything premade and keeps it refrigerated until someone decides to purchase it. And that statement came from one of their own employees!  I would not recommend this place to anyone... Even if you're in a hurry and need a quick bite... Go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a mid afternoon pick me up thought I'd try the white mocha coffee and the breakfast burrito. The coffee was \"ok\" -substandard to the Starbucks mocha. It was pretty weak, almost watered down compared to Starbucks. I knew the burrito was a gamble but I was hungry. It was under seasoned and took quite awhile to be given to me considering it was pre-made and nuked. It was unappetizing and I did not finish it. Oh, it also cost $7 for the burrito, way over priced for the quality."}
{"text":"I was in Vegas for work at the Convention Center and would have to be an early riser to catch a cab to the convention center and sometimes to Home Depot. I didn't have time for a full on breakfast and had to pick up breakfast, lunch and a potential dinner for our crew. Fuel has a range of healthy and satisfying options at prices that won't break the bank.  Try their double sausage and cheese sandwich. Yep, it's as hearty as it sounds. It would be perfect if you were hungover, because it is a bit on the greasy side. But it did the job for me!  Given that I was doing work when the Convention Center was not fully open (meaning, their food stalls were closed), I was grateful that this convenient spot opened early and had some fresh options for our crew."}
{"text":"I suspect this place is new and still working the bugs out because there is much room for improvement.   There were 4 people in line when I arrived and it took 15 minutes to get a cup of unremarkable drip coffee that was already made. I would not want to be here when it's busy because It simply can not take 15 minutes to serve a cup of coffee."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting much at this cafe, since it was at the Hard Rock.  It was pretty dead when we came in.  The girl at the register wasn't too bad.  She took our order and went straight to making our drinks.  She was by herself.  We got our drinks pretty quickly.  Took us about 5-10 minutes.  My ice black tea was good,not sweet as I requested so I'm happy about that.  The one thing I didn't like about this visit was she didn't wash her hands after she used the register and sneezed then make our drinks.  It's gross.  We had our coffee and tea, then my friend texted me to get her a coffee too.  We went back in to order another drink, this time there were 3 other people in front of us.  It took a while for us to place an order because it's only one person working.  Then we see another girl walk in from some where else carrying a bunch of items and sat those down on the counter behind the bar.  She went straight into making the drinks on the bar.  Once again, this barista didn't wash her hands either before touching food and beverage items.  This last visit took about 15-20 minutes for latte.  Staffs need to wash their hands after touching themselves and doing anything else before serving customers!!!  This is a place where germs are spread like crazy!!"}
{"text":"I was in need of a coffee and something to snack on before heading to the Rehab Pool Party. This was on the way to the pool, so I stopped in for a chef salad and an iced coffee and my friends ordered a couple of breakfast burritos and a latte.   I'm surprised by all of the 1 star reviews because when we went, service was great, coffee tasted fine/woke me up, and my chef salad was filling and surprisingly good. Yes, my salad was a tad over-priced, but if you're coming to Vegas looking for a deal, you might want to pack your own food then. I could have gone somewhere else for a snack, but because of the convenient location to where I was headed, Fuel Cafe hit the spot."}
{"text":"Close to the Casino Tower.  A variety of coffees/beverages to choose from. Decent breakfast options. Long lines and wait, usually.  Mediocre price range."}
{"text":"This places coffee is terrible! Stayed at the hard rock and went this place on 2 separate days just to give it another shot as I'm an avid coffee drinker in the mornings.   I only went to 2 stars as the food selection is decent, comparable to Starbucks. But the coffee is gross, near undrinkable if you are a GOOD coffee person, if you will drink any old pot of burnt coffee put in front of you this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"4 stars for chai.   0 stars for customer service.   Chai was surprisingly good. Huh. Thanks barista man who made it ! You're  a super star !  Customer service: We were on break from the conference & decided to get some chai. Had 3-4 people and after I named all of the drink orders cashier said they need to see ID with debit/credit cards.  Ugh fine - but maybe put up a sign !! She said she will get the drinks started so it will be ready when I get back.  Walked all the way back and stood at the register for a bit - there were 4 more customers at that point that had not ordered yet - she rang me up and we waited. Everyone got their drinks before we did - including those that hadn't ordered yet when she was swiping my card. They also forgot some guys tea. So  A. They didn't start it like she stated they would B. They forgot about us and made Drinks for 8 or so people before making ours.   And here's the most annoyingly part - guy in his wheelchair spills his coffee on his hand and on the ground in the middle of the cafe. They didn't close the lid right enough so as he was putting his cup into the holder the lid just slipped off * good job guys !!!  He tells the barista folks and no one goes to wipe it up - mind you its in the middle of the floor = safety hazard. So guy in the wheelchair starts wiping the floor - you\"d think they would stop him and clean it's up ? Nope."}
{"text":"It nice and clean with a pretty good selection,  unfortunately I think their food is too pricey, got one if those egg white burrito- $9, there is no meat , just egg white and a few slice chilies, plus comes with salsa. You are better to drive to MC Donald's down the street"}
{"text":"Had a coupon for free coffee ,but I needed to buy a sandwich or dessert! So after looking at the menu the girl tells me we only have sausage mc muffin or bacon and egg! I was like okay great choices! Not!  The sandwich was whatever's to expensive 7 bucks really??not the best tasting sandwich! It was like McDonald, but more Cheese melted on paper wrap! Lol seriously but this place gets a star for their coffee!"}
{"text":"Any place that gets me my morning Caffeine Fix fast, uses quality Coffee, has reasonable prices and good Customer Service gets Four Stars from me!"}
{"text":"We got stale bagels. originally ordered the pizza which looked 2 days old.  And also got the breakfast burrito which had a hair in it. I would not recommend at all"}
{"text":"After a night of drinking and a sobering breakfast my group and I stopped here for something sweet and caffeinated. We had a long drive to LA at 7am and we needed all the help we could get. So we received some awesome service and this amazing red velvet waffle made from cake batter. I just want you to know that it was so good it didn't survive the short walk to the parking lot."}
{"text":"Came here to get a late breakfast before wandering out for the day. They were really packed. Apparently it's the place to come and leave your suitcases in the middle of the floor while you're waiting to leave for the airport.  We got a couple of coffees (which were lava hot) and a bagel and a muffin. It was all good, for being coffee and a bagel."}
{"text":"Their Illy Americano espresso coffee drink (cold) is amazing and COMPLETELY ADDICTIVE! Highly suggest trying if you like strong coffee. The staff was VERY nice and by the third day, already knew my name and order."}
{"text":"All sold out except the samples made if clay  or the place closed don't build on this place  Even for overpriced coffee"}
