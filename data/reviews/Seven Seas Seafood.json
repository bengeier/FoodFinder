{"text":"Mediocre food, service, ambience. We're from Maryland so have high expectations when it comes to seafood. They weren't met, in any way."}
{"text":"First thing I have to say, is that the Scallops are the best I have ever had! We also got shrimp scampi those were huge and also very good. The Walleye was fresh and very tasty! I can't wait to try the fresh oysters on Monday! Thank you so much for a memorable meal. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It's a fish market that's been here many years. It's spotless clean and doesn't smell. It's got a kitchen that will cook whatever you pick while you wait. We got Lake Perch and Catfish dinners. Best fish I've ever had. Absolutely a gem! 21 bucks for 2 dinners with fries, slaw and a roll."}
{"text":"Got a pound of shrimp this weekend and some crab dip. When I went in my fridge later in the evening, the shrimp stunk in a bad shrimp way. We ended up throwing them out. The crab dip was more cheese than crab. While I was there, I also witnessed a very unpleasant customer service experience. Loved this place, was very disappointed after this weekend."}
{"text":"We just moved to the Kamm's Corners neighborhood and were very pleased to see that Seven Seas Seafood was just a short jaunt from our house.  We tried it for the first time recently and, although the prices were good, we were somewhat disappointed.  We ordered three dinners; I had oysters, my wife had lake perch, and my daughter had the seafood sampler.  My fried oysters were a little overcooked and therefore somewhat dry.  My wife's perch was very disappointing, primarily because the breading was so thick.  You don't want anything but a light coating on perch and what they did was way too much.  My daughter enjoyed her dinner and, though it included fried pollack, that breading was much better.  I don't know if it was different or if there was just less of it.    The fries that come with the dinners are nothing special; they just seem to be your typical frozen potatoes.  The coleslaw is very good however.  I'm going to see if I can get some fresh lake perch today to be fried at home, and I may try the prepared dinners again, although I'll tell them what I didn't like on the last batch to try and get better results.  I really want them to do better next time because I'd like to be able to patronize them more often."}
{"text":"Very friendly customer service,  fresh seafood, clean inside store , wish you could order on line to pick up food ."}
{"text":"The general rule as people from either coast remind us is that where there is a large population of one ethnic group one can find the best of its food. Cleveland blows that theory out of the water. It has a large African American population but glaringly lacks what is considered soul or southern food. Other cities have outstanding fried chicken, fried fish, or barbecue, or plate dinners that attract residents from all over to the inner city. Sylvia's in Harlem, Arthur Bryant's in Kansas City, or Gus's Hot Chicken in Memphis have achieved national recognition. As of yet I have only been to one Cleveland African American restaurant I revisit.   Luckily Seven Seas serves fried fish dinners that make me smile. Although in a predominantly white area I always find African Americans here. Seven Seas is a seafood market selling a wide variety of fresh fish and seafood. The selections fluctuate depending on what the oceans offer at the particular time. Prices are fair and service is above average.  The real draw is they will make a fish dinner from any fish you choose. And an even better service for me is if I buy a pound of fish they fry it for  only a buck.  Add my own sides and I have a fish fry Scarlett O'Hara is begging to attend."}
{"text":"For lunch a couple of coworkers and I had the seafood platter and two of us also ordered a side of four ocean perch each. What a wonderful lunch. i'd almost forgotten what a wonderful job they do, if you haven't eaten there you must try it"}
{"text":"I went there and asked for 5 dozen clams, they picked 60 of the best clams I have ever eaten. Every single clam opened. The clams were cleaned and perfect!!!!  Staff was wonderful and helpful!!!!  Also, the crab cheese dip was fabulous!!!!"}
{"text":"I had a few questions about a clambake that I was having, since I'm not a professional I figured they could answer my questions. The gentleman was super rude to me on the phone about everything that I had asked. I called Heinens immediately after talking to this gentlemen, they answered all of my questions professionally and we're glad to help me. So glad I didn't waste my time with this seafood co."}
{"text":"I'm tired of paying crack prices for clambakes these days.  Whomever pays 25.00 even 35.00 for some chicken, bullshit sweet potato and a dozen clams all cooked to a mushy brown color in a mesh bag is a schmuck.  Do it yourself at about 10.00 a head WITH fizzy beer.  I had a small one at the crib with close family and friends and called these dudes up for the star of the show.  They were priced the exact same as all the other places I tried.  I got many compliments on how fresh and not-gritty they were!  Close to the house and when I came Saturday morn to pick it up they had my little crustaceans ready with my name on it.  Place doesn't look like a Whole Foods out front so Yuppies may not even notice it but if you want good, fresh seafood not wrapped in Styrofoam and plastic, come here..."}
{"text":"I love Seven Seas- friendly staff, fried fish dinners, homemade clam chowder. I only wish they were open later. We rarely are able to make it in after work before they close at 6pm."}
{"text":"This is a fish market-  but it does take out, too, and the fried scallops and cole slaw I had for lunch the other day hit the spot.  The fish here looks fresh -  if I lived in the neighborhood I'd come once a week at least."}
{"text":"At a friend's recommendation we tried their fried fish lunch.  We both felt that the portion was generous and delicious, price was reasonable and slaw is awesome.  There's no tables, so u need to take it to-go.  I also purchased some scrod and shrimp and cooked it up the next night and still was the freshest i've had.   Don't b fooled by the appearance, from the outside it doesn't look like much, but who needs atmosphere when u have such great fresh seafood.  Highly recommend for a quick casual good lunch or if you want to cook your own fresh fish."}
{"text":"The saying 'You get what you pay for' is certainly applicable here. No, the prices are not as low as you would find in the local grocery store. But the quality of the seafood doesn't really compare. And to put my money towards a local business, who has been part of our community for years is also worth the extra dollars.  I am lucky that Seven Seas is as the top of my street, so it's very convenient to stop in on my way home to grab some scallops or shrimp or fillet for dinner.  Not to mention Al's famous cocktail sauce!    The service is not always 'with a smile'. Sometimes I actually feel like I'm bothering them, and it's dissuaded me from coming in before. I'd love to see them a little friendlier."}
{"text":"Hand goes in the tartar sauce. Cod goes in the tartar sauce. Shark is in the tartar sauce. Sorry, had a Jaws flashback. It was a hot summer afternoon sometime back in August, and my pooch and I were hardcore craving seafood. Not just fish n chips, or Long Johns or fish sandwich. We wanted fresh from the water bounty of the sea. Crustaceans, mollusks, things with fins, legs and other crispy bits. The closest place is Don's Lighthouse. Lunch menu seemed pretty good, but somehow didn't strike my fancy. I fired up the old yelp and found Seven Seas. It was a fish market. Not what I was looking for. But wait, in the fine print: we will cook whatever you buy here. Uh, hell yes! Got a tilapia meal(slaw, bun, fries, sauces) and a seafood platter(same as other with a variety of shrimp and scallops). Both together cost under 20 bucks. I got to watch the clerk pick the fish out of the case and take it back to the kitchen. It was all tasty and so filling.  And if you are so inclined, you can also shop for fresh seafood to cook yourself. Making this place the west side Euclid Fish. And you don't even have to brave a hail of bullets to get there. Unlike Euclid Fish. They are now outfitting clambakes and cooking up daily fresh pots of clam chowder during the fall(I know cuz I signed up to their Facebook). Can't wait to go back. Farewell and adieu to you fair Spanish ladies. Farewell and adieu you ladies of Spain..."}
{"text":"Frequent shopper, several times a month. I usually buy scrod, shrimp or imitation crab. Been my favorite, and only choice for seafood as long as ive lived in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Purchased two 14oz frozen lobster tails on Saturday, May 19. Was told to put in cold water, once it boiled, boil for one minute. They curled so bad, ruined two pot holders in trying to straighten to get the flesh.  Was still have raw. Contacted Seven Seas on Facebook. Totally loudly response.  Will never go there.  The Hildebrandt's have gone for years.  Just wanted you all to know."}
