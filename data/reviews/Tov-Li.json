{"text":"I have a long history with Tov Li. I have been a customer as early back as I can remember, mostly because I live down the street. The food has always been above average, but oily. However, I avoid going there at all costs. Allow me to explain. Upon entering Tov Li, you are immediately greeted with a line of disgruntled customers. Then you reach the order taker/cashier, who is often in a foul mood. She takes your order and  scribbles it down on to a little piece of paper. Then you have to wait in the next line to hand this piece of paper to another rude worker. Finally after you wait in 2 lines your food starts to get made. Sounds like a very efficient system doesn't it?"}
{"text":"when i saw that falafels were being featured on Yelp this week, one word came to mind...TOVLI.  luckily i work in this neck of the woods, otherwise it would be pretty heroic (but SO worth it!) to come up here for lunch from downtown!  there is another location just south of wilson on bathurst, but i think that's it.  i love falafels, and i think that TOVLI has the best in the city.  and yes it's those sexy falafel sandwiches that i adore...  the falafel balls alone are pretty fabulous, but the sandwiches rock!  stuffed full of their salad (a kind of coleslaw) and your choice of pickled turnips (my favourite) and such, they are HUGE and wonderful.  definitely not for first dates or for in the car, these require 2 hands, lots of napkins and a good appetite!"}
{"text":"Very sweet people! I went in one day early morning and was greeted by a lady a very welcoming attitude! I ordered a Greek salad to go and it was delicious! The portions are great! I will have to come back here and try everything else on the menu!"}
{"text":"Falafel is great.  Service is very disorganized.  Unless your wearing a beard and religious they will treat you like garbage.  Don't understand how the religious people get the free deluxe toppings and the regular people are charged for them.  They also somehow allow them to bud in line."}
{"text":"The best falafel I've ever had.  I haven't had anything else here do I can't talk about the rest but if you choose to only eat one falafel in your life eat it here!"}
{"text":"This place has the most amazing pizza I've ever had in my entire life and I am a pizza aficionado. Definitely coming back again, and again. Onto Menchies!"}
{"text":"The falafel sandwich. All I come for and all I need from here. They make the falafel fresh whilst you wait a couple minutes. Great price and huge portions."}
{"text":"Yup. Still the worst service. Called in a takeout order and they hung up as soon as they got the order. So I called back to ask how much it would be and how long, she said it will be $- and then hung up! (Mind you this was a different person who answered the second time) I called a third got the same person as the second and asked her how long and she said \"I don't know what's your order? How am I supposed to know sheesh\" I told her our order and she gave me the time and then hang up.    Not once did they say goodbye. Rude"}
{"text":"Awful food and awful service in awful surroundings!!!      There are few kosher restaurants so unfortunately anything goes!!!"}
{"text":"Friendly service and great food. They go the extra mile to make you happy. I recently discovered they have breakfast also which was very nice! Delivery service is also prompt and food comes fresh. Definitely the best kosher place around."}
{"text":"Tov Li's north location does not have the same ambiance as the south location. It reminds me of a small town road side cafe. Not a dinning room for those looking for privacy. Very open, basic room.  I suggest this location as a GREAT place for take-out.   Tov Li is Hebrew for 'Good for me'. The name really does say it all! This kosher, Cholov Yisrael dairy restaurant does pizza, dessert, veggie burgers, sandwiches, all day Israeli-style breakfast, falafel, ice-cream, soups and fish.   They make a fantastic pizza and offer crusts with white, whole grain or spelt flour. They cheese is generous as are the very fresh toppings. You will not be disappointed.    I found the service to be very good and the counter-based ordering system seemed to make sense."}
{"text":"I've had the falafel pita twice now and disappointed both times. The falafel did not taste good nor was it the proper consistency. Very good coleslaw though!"}
{"text":"Best falafel in the city. Freshest ingredients. Amazing shakshuka also. You will never feel heavy or gross after a meal here. Open kitchen in compliance with being kosher and all. I've been coming here for years and the people behind the counter here have been working there forever, they know what they're doing."}
{"text":"Top picks: vegetarian poutine, mac&cheese, plain pizza  Other good choices: kol bol salad, split pea soup  I've been going here my whole life. The food is consistently satisfying. To those who don't appreciate certain aspects of the service, you can't expect Canadian style service at ethnic restaurants. Part of the fun is getting to know the quirks and idiosyncrasies of another culture. I always appreciate visiting. It's refreshing to go there for the food and experience."}
{"text":"Delicious albeit perfunctory service and confusing to order your first time. The falafels are a huge, delicious mess and out of this world. Veggie pizza with paper thin zucchini slices was soooo good.  Coleslaw was too sweet for me, but garlic twists and salads were amazing. Get the falafel and plan on having left overs as it's hard to finish in one setting.  Don't be shy, they'll help you navigate their menu, but it does tend to be loud and crowded with lots of families with kids. Not fine dining, but delicious and worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Hi - I eat there often and they are always offer fresh food and great service. I have seen them put up with some really annoying customers so hats off to them. There Pizza and Cali flower and falafel is what I always get there. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I used to go to this restaurant all the time but in the last month they have doubled their not a 25% increase but DOUBLED.  in MOST TAKEOUT ITEMS. won't be going back."}
{"text":"Falafel here is outstanding !  Best I've ever had.  I come here whenever I'm in the area. Pizza and other stuff is good but falafel is perfect and fresh toppings.  This is a Jewish place and for the record I'm an Arab; that's how good the falafels are ! Haha !"}
{"text":"Greattttt falafels. $5 for a massive, eggplant, hummas, veggie filled falafel sandwich which is literally bursting out of the pita.  Be sure to get lots of napkins and a fork, because you're going to need to plan out how to attack this thing.  I've never experienced a long wait (as Dan G. points out in his review) but I do agree the service isn't extraordinary.  The ones taking your order seem indifferent and bored, but given the (lack of) ambiance here, it doesn't affect me much.  Tov-li is kosher and doesn't serve any meat (save fish), so its not your thing for you carnivores out there.  But for anyone who enjoys a falafel, I encourage you to give Tov-Li a try."}
{"text":"This place has the best pizza. It's tasty and flavourful yet healthy too. If you ask politely, most of the staff members will even make you a pizza just the way you like it. Their falafel is super tasty and filling too. Their fries, onion rings, and soups are really delicious. Seating is limited and the restaurant is often busy especially in the afternoon and evening. But, in terms of customer service, this place is not the best and I've experienced much better.  And now, the negative aspects. First, every time I order soup, it is always served stone cold and when I ask the staff to warm it up, they get all huffy about it. Next, some of the staff members aren't very nice. I called in a dine-in order once and it wasn't ready on time when my family arrived at the restaurant. Then, when I politely asked one lady behind the counter about my order status, she rudely answered that the food will be ready when it's ready and that I shouldn't meddle in things that I don't know about. How very rude and inconsiderate! I was merely attempting to find out why my order was taking so long to fill out and this lady was so full of attitude. So now I attempt to spare myself from utter humiliation by just ordering my food in person. I will never call in an order again. Lastly, the tables are never clean and I have to use napkins and clean my table myself.   Honestly, this place is good for a quick lunch or dinner but it is not a place where one can actually relax and eat a full meal."}
{"text":"Even if you had falafel in Israel or anywhere in the Middle East this place blows them all away. Pun intended as in flavor only. Don't park your camel in the humpicap parking or you'll get camel toed."}
{"text":"Sticking with my previous posts kosher pizza is awesome. This place is no different.  The pizza here is fresh tasty and delicious. Not as good as some of the other kosher pizza places I have reviewed but still tasty.  This place is actually known for their falafels. The balls are massive and so is the sandwhich. When ordering you always opt for the falafel PLUS. The plus is 1.99 more but it allows you to add ALL of the extra salads into your falafel....marinated mushrooms....beets....spicy eggplant....fried eggplant. Its a gluttony of middle eastern fair and its delicious.  Why only a 3 star? Staff is extremely rude. Wait time is very long...not because its super busy but because the staff is rude and the set up is inefficient."}
{"text":"Really good cheese pizza slices, well worth the drive. The spicy fries are also worth it, a must try. The cookies on display looked scrumptious, but maybe I will try them another time."}
{"text":"Talk about angry workers!  So you place your order and the lady at the cash screams the order to the staff.  You're in line, the staff asks what you ordered.  You give them this ticket. 3 minutes later In walks a Rabbi, he places his order.  They take the Rabbi's order.  Somehow he just budded me and takes the falafel that was supposed to be made for me.  I see he ordered the regular falafel but somehow gets all these extra toppings on his.  I say wow, I am going to try that.  I ask for the exact same toppings and they tell me you have to pay for them they are \"deluxe\" toppings.  So if I grow a beard and get brainwashed by a religion I get free toppings? No thanks I'll stick to just being Jewish in disguise. I explain that the yid who just budded me got free toppings.   They whisper something in Tagalog and then ignore me. God said all Jews are equal.  Not at Tov Li.  Their falafel is a sloppy mess of slaw and under cooked balls.  It falls apart as soon as you try to bite it.  Their Tehina is runny."}
{"text":"just had food from here this morning, last night, earlier in the day yesterday, just after a first breakfast yesterday morning and im hoping to polish off the remnants over the next couple of days.  hows that for committed?  like all great middle eastern places, i only have them when i am north of eglinton.  this is not a frequent occurrence, for good reason.  however, when im there, i delight in their robust falafel balls that crunch on the outside and warm your mouth with the softness of a pillow on the inside.   this holds true even when they are cold - except for the crunchy part, but NEVER are they dry like virtually all falafel places south of there.    the salads are fresh, tasty, albeit a little oily - but i cant resist the eggplant salad even though its bathing in oil.  the pita is the only kind i enjoy - a big circular pocket thats fluffy and fresh.  the hummous and tehina are perfect in their consistency, and spice.  the only thing that i dont like from this place, is when you go inside and order a falafel sandwich...its gargantuan...so much so that you have no idea how to approach it...and you want to approach it...its like a hot sexy big assed, big breasted, big lipped woman.  (not quite sure if that metaphor worked but, i gave it a go at least.)"}
{"text":"The falafel at Tov is second to none. Crispy on the outside and gooey on the inside. I like to keep the toppings traditional - hummus, hot sauce, tahini, coleslaw and Israeli salad. I have heard great things about the \"Deluxe Falafel\" - for an extra $1, you can add Baba Ganoush and eggplant.   Nothing in Toronto compares...unless you want to head over to Israel for a quick bite. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Can't believe I haven't reviewed these guys yet. Best falafel in town. And it's so huge you feel guilty that you ate the whole thing by yourself. But surprisingly you don't feel too full. Reason being more than half of it is healthy veggies and salads including my favorite beet and turnip pickles! I've had their pizza and salads as well but the falafel is what brings me back. And I've never found these guys to be rude or anything. Just bear in mind you are in an ethnic restaurant. It's not the keg!"}
{"text":"Went here with my dad for some falafel, he asked for fresh falafel and was told it was fresh out of the frier. Before putting the balls into his pita however, the server proceeded to throw the falafels back into the oil to heat them up (because they WERE NOT fresh), took them out, and put them in his pita. He's very health conscious, and was furious as the double deep frying makes falafel incredibly unhealthy while also affecting the taste. I also had a lentil soup, which was microwaved in front of me... had two spoonfulls before throwing it out."}
{"text":"Had two slices of pizza which were good but a bit oily. Table was't that clean and I didn't see anyone cleaning tables. You are at the mercy of the previous customer.   Line was long but it moved and seemed to be running efficiently."}
{"text":"Food Quality: Pizza is not the best tasting but is palatable. The falafel I have to say is one of the best.  Matti's down south used to have the best falafel in town but since they have closed Tov Li I would have to say is second best.  They specialize with their falafel. Very tasty and we keep coming back for more.  Service: During busy times not so great for a fast food joint.  I had to wait about 40 minutes for a falefel during busy times. The order cloaks do not greet you or say hello. Just \"what would you like?\" I have seen cashiers in no frills with better greetings.  As for the food servers they were quick and responsive when they did make your order.  Decor: Decor is nice but way too many chairs for a place like this. I am surprised it is not a fire code hazard.  Overall: A nice place to eat but avoid busy times if you are bringing your family as the busy times get overcrowded."}
{"text":"I avoid Tov Li when I can.   The service is unreliable and disorganized and the food is barely acceptable.   The last few times I ordered a falafel, the pita was sliced all the way around and caused everything stuffed in to fall out. I get that they want to offer a lot to their customers but when half my sandwich lands in my plate, then there is a problem. I've also requested that they don't open it as much but have been ignored.  The pizza is OK to say the least, There are worse kosher pizza places in Toronto.  Ask for a receipt next time you go there. It'll piss them off."}
{"text":"This restaurant is often very busy, particularly around noon. There is no meat but they do serve fish items. The faffel here is great and often quite stuffed. While there is seating available,  it is limited and very basic. It is mainly a take out restaurant. Most items are within 10 dollars and very filling.   For what it is, I think it is a good choice for a quick bite if you are in the area.  Tip: Try the deluxe faffel. Also if you are in a rush call ahead of time to the avoid the line up around lunch."}
{"text":"This place has the most amazing tomato zucchini pizza. It has a thin crust with the nicest cheese on it. I've eaten at both the north and south locations and am never disappointed. Everything is a bit pricier because it's kosher, but the portions and taste make it all worth it. I recommend their pizza, falafel sandwich, spicy fries and the Cobb salad! I know...I've eaten here way too much!"}
{"text":"Complaining about Toronto's kosher restaurants is a bit of a hobby of mine.   I'm fortunate to be friends with a few members of the Orthodox Jewish community.  I'm even more fortunate that we share a love of food that bridges our different philopsphies and often provides the canvas for enertaining and informative conversations. While my friends' dining options are somewhat more limited than mine, I can easily get by, and kasruth itself becomes part of the conversation.   Bound by ancient laws and traditions, simple prohibitions against eating pork or seafood, or boiling a kid in it's mothers' milk have given rise to a series of increasingly restrictive rules which speak not only to the food that ends up on one's plate, but the plate itself, the kitchen that prepares the food, and the whole supply chain from farm to table. Supervision and scrutiny are required at every step of the way, and different sects may interpret the same rule differently.   Done right, Kosher food comes closer to the organic, local ideal that foodies espouse. Done poorly, it turns food into bureaucracy, drained of colour and taste as business owners sacrifice quality in order to pay the freight for the gatekeepers of the kashruth process.   There are some very good kosher restaurants in the city, but for the most part you pay a significant premium to eat healthy, tasty food. Combined with further laws that prevent a certified kosher spot from opening during days of observance, and it's a wonder that anyone makes a go of this kind of business.   Here endeth the rant.   Because Tov-Li is awesome whether or not you claim membership in the Tribe.   A mini-chain with locations in the heart of Toronto's Jewish community, Tov-Li offers it's own take on (Middle) East meets West.  The menu promises everything from Italian to Israeli, with soups and sandwiches thrown into the mix. Said mix does not include meat. Don't try to order pepperoni on your pizza.     Do order the pizza, with any number of fresh or roasted vegetables. A plain cheese slice is closer to New York style than most. Toppings are fresh, sometimes more abundant than others. Sauce is bright and more flavorful than most. Cheese is surprisingly light on the palate. I suspect it's because true Kosher cheese uses a different kind of rennet (sheep aren't Kosher).    Salads are similarly fresh, though traditionalists might be offended by the substitution of iceberg for romaine in the Caesar (which traces back to the expense of inspection-Romaine has more nooks and crannies, apparently). Those who are offended by the lack of bacon should move on to another review.  A mixed salad plate opens a world of possibilities; eggplant, carrot, beet, turnip, hummus 'n' tahini and other options could unclog the arteries of the most hardcore carnivore, especially when scooped up with fresh, fluffy pita bread. The same fillings, along with tuna, egg and other dairy standards are available as submarine sandwiches. With the exception of a roasted vegetable version, they're worth a miss.   Put bluntly, Tov-Li makes the single, absolute best falafel that I have ever tasted.  Falafel preferences are intensely personal and often associated with one's political identity. I prefer the Israeli chickpea-only style, though primarily because I like thetaste; it's a brighter, less beany falafel and a better showcase for garlic, cumin and cilantro. Tov Li's falafels are fried to a firm crispy golden brown, with soft yielding centres. The pita is fresh and pillowy, and the sandwich is stuffed with an array of fresh and pickled vegetables. Hot sauce is a smoky sharp kick to the back of the throat. Ask nicely and they'll balance it withh a schmear of creamy eggplant dip.   Service is perfunctory. Order at the near corner and pick up at the back. Balance your overstuffed pita in a paper plate as you make your way to one of several fast-food style tables. Eat quickly, and leave. It's not a place to linger with a sweetheart, especially if you're not the marrying type. Tov-Li caters to a modest crowd, so PDAs are best avoided."}
{"text":"Amazing food!!!!  Specifically the Israeli breakfast and cheese pizza  Very authentic, fresh Israeli cuisine  When I worked in the area I was there daily....oh how I miss this place"}
