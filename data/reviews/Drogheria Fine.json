{"text":"5$ for a sandwich and a latte. Can you get a better deal anywhere in Montreal these days? The latte was terribly mediocre (even bad) but the sandwich (and price) made up for it, it was delicious and they even threw together a bococcini salad on the side for me. Respectably, here were only two sandwich choices- easy decisions- and no menu. It's a family-run operation and it still has that vibe. Wonderful."}
{"text":"Première fois que je mange des gnocchis. C'était très bon et vraiment remplissant pour 5$! Le piment à saupoudrer est très piquant y aller avec parcimonie."}
{"text":"Very cute, very good, good potions, could not finish my basket, fun to go there for luch or pick up for dinner!! Lovely service:) Great idea!! Good job! You cannot get better for 5$!!"}
{"text":"$5 flat gnocci to go?! What's not to love. A pretty sizeable portion for an on-the-go snack that was shared between a few of us. Awesome little spot!"}
{"text":"Gnocchi for five bucks? 

There's no reason not to try...

The gnocchi has wonderful texture, it's soft it melts in your mouth.

The sauce is a bit salty, and greasy.  I took it home and added a little tomato sauce and it was perfect hihi. 

It wasn't bad, I just wanted it to taste the way I like it, no offense.

I'm definitely coming here for gnocchi from now on, and the portion is very generous for 5$.
Probably the best food deal in MTL.

Love this place."}
{"text":"I went to the fairmount location and bought a pot mason of gnocchi. The pasta were way too salty, the sauce to thick and the texture of the gnocchi too dry. The taste was fine apart from the salt. I would like to try the sauce without the gnocchi. Definitely not 5*."}
{"text":"Perfectly made little gnocchi served in a paper to-go container! It comes with a light, homemade Italian gravy.  Sit outside and enjoy these little delights. Just make sure you don't get too much... If you're really hungry you can polish off one container. Otherwise share! You don't want to waste them."}
{"text":"Rolled out of bed craving gnocchi so this was the go to choice and it did not disappoint... fresh gnocchi in a delicious tomato sauce made on the spot. The gnocchi was steaming out of the box and finished off with fresh Parmesan, generous portion and very affordable! MUST TRY. Gnocchi will never be the same"}
{"text":"Wow! A hole in the wall takeout of just gnocchi! The most delicious gnocchi and tomato sauce with a generous topping of grated cheese on top served in a Chinese takeout container. The portion is large and is only $5! The aroma from this little kitchen is a gift to the neighborhood and this Italian institution is a gift to Montreal! Please please come to NY!"}
{"text":"Incredible gnocchi with a wonderful tomato sauce and fresh Parmesan cheese. We stopped by Kem CoBa for ice cream and saw many people eating from a take out box, I was curious and asked where it was from and they pointed to this little counter where a man was handing out these delicious containers of gnocchi for 5$. I just had to try it, and I definitely don't regret it. So good!"}
{"text":"So I went here after hearing rave reviews about how great the gnocchi here is, so that might be why I was a bit disappointed.  The price was great for the portion I received.  I definitely wasn't hungry after and I didn't feel stuffed, which was nice.  The gnocchi was soft, which is great, but I think someone mentioned it in a previous review that the sauce is a bit tart, which I personally am not a fan of.  So it really depends on your taste buds and what you enjoy.  Personally, it was a lovely experience and I like that it is made there, but it wasn't my cup of tea."}
{"text":"Je ne pensais pas manger à ce point bien et pas cher! Je ne mange pas souvent de gnocchi mais ceux ci étaient les meilleurs que j'ai mangés! 

Ils étaient frais, faits maison et le service était impeccable. La sauce était simple mais pour 3,5 cela valait son prix.

Aussi nous avons pris une boîte pour deux et cela nous a rassasié"}
{"text":"I would love to give them negative stars. Worst service and most disrespectful man alive. My friend went to the window to purchase gnocchi and asked one of the employees if she could go inside and look at sauce and oil to purchase as a souvenir. She was told it was no problem. While she was looking at the wall of sauce considering if she should buy it, another employee came over and started berating her. He said \"get out of here, this is not America you are not your own boss and cannot do whatever you want. This is the our business and you need to leave,\" among other things. My friend had already paid for the gnocchi and was in complete shock. We took one bite each of the gnocchi (which was cold by the way). Not worth the absolutely appalling disrespect. Good luck"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved stopping in the small secondary location in Little Italy. They have a store that sells items and the small location that my girlfriend and I had the pleasure of finding. We were walking around Little Italy on a Sunday. We split the a Panini and order of gnocchi. It was a perfect afternoon meal if you are exploring. The red sauce was very good, no added salt/sugar like most sauces these days and also had great consistency. With two drinks we spent $10 Canadian. I love finding small gems among the immense number of restaurants in Montreal. It has the most restaurants per capita in North America so it can be tough to navigate."}
{"text":"Terrible tomato sauce. I never conceived of a tomato sauce being greasy until I encountered Drogheria's 'Nonna' tomato sauce. It's less of a sauce, more of a cup of tomato puree suspended in a litre of oil."}
{"text":"The gnocchis were very good, the sauce nothing to write home about and the service was done right rude. The 2 ladies and the man were all miserable looking. They rushed us to an insane degree for no good reason. When I asked fir more cheese they pointed to a sign saying it was an extra $1, which I was willing to spend but they didn't allow it because they were so busy rushing me along. Oh and did I mention there wasn't a line up and it 2:15pm on a thursday. Great deal for the price but don't expect any service with that. Let alone a smile."}
{"text":"While waiting for ice cream, we saw that this place had many customers buying the gnocchi and it smelled pretty good. It was only 5$ so we decided to give it a try. The gnocchi was a bit too soft and the sauce was bland. We had to add a lot of spicy pepper flake to add some flavor in it. The portion is big for 5$, but the taste isn't that great. A lot of parmesan and pepper flakes has to be added for it to have flavor."}
{"text":"Best meal I've had in Montreal!  These gnocchi are simply delicious!  So soft! And the sauce is amazing!   You can either eat them hot on the spot or take a glass jar home and enjoy them heated up in a pan.  Either way it is just heavenly good!   I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Une petite \"boutique de rue\" laissant s' échapper d enivrantes effluves de tomates.....voilà ce à quoi ressemble cette échoppe! 
Derrière le comptoir, une grosse marmite de gnocchis maison baignant dans une sauce tomates-basilic absolument divine vous attend!
Je recommande vivement ce petit coin de paradis où le gnocchi est roi...et ou vos papilles seront à coup sûr contentées! 
Il s agit uniquement de plat à emporter (singulier car c'est un plat unique qui est servi!) et vous pouvez également acheter des pots de sauce tomates maison.
Le tout est servi avec du parmesan très parfumé....et ceci pour la modique somme de 5$ pour le petit contenant et 10 pour le plus grand!
Les prix se passent de commentaires....."}
{"text":"This place is cheap and good.

$6.50 , tax included, for a veal sausage ciabatta, latte and a side of risotto.
 
This place is ridiculously small, they do make coffee, but it's not the kind of place where you can lounge for hours.

The only drawback is they seem to run out of lots of stuff, so no selection when i went there."}
{"text":"La sauce tomate est à se rouler par terre. Divin"}
{"text":"The search continues for inexpensive gnocchi. While this tiny shop serves up a hot, healthy portion of gnocchi in a generous tomato sauce for a low price... it unsurprisingly misses the mark on quality. The flavour of tomato sauce is overwhelming with its acidity and saltiness. The gnocchi is buried into this sauce and is rather hard to taste. It's like you're chewing on something soft and doughy without much of a flavour profile. But it definitely fills you up fast on the cheap, if that's what you're looking for!"}
{"text":"Super novel way to eat gnocchi. I appreciate the resourcefulness of the owners.The gnocchi itself was a bit too starchy for me but the sauce was nice and savory (on the acidic rather than sweet side) and rather straightforward. Portions were huge--two people can definitely share one. As others have stated, you can get an ice cream afterwards. I'm glad we tried it."}
{"text":"Location: Right next to Kem Coba! So you can eat gnocchi then have dessert. Anyway, the place is located on Fairmount, west of St. Laurent. Street parking is available but metered, and in terms of transit, you could grab the 55 bus all the way up. Not sure what other options are available. 

The place: I don't have much to say since this isn't a sitdown place - you can't actually enter this tiny box. Someone takes your order at the door (or window), you pay, then you get your order).

The goods: I think there's too much hype about the gnocchi. First, they were barely warm, and they were very starchy. The sauce was good, however. In terms of portion size, I thought it was big - my friend and I shared one and we couldn't finish it. Of course, we'd been eating since the night before so you know, that could have had something to do with it. If you don't like a lot of parmesan, mention it - they're pretty generous with it. 

Service: OK. 

Price point: $5 tax in.

It makes for a good snack, but it's not the best gnocchi I've had in the city."}
{"text":"OMG des gnoccis faits maison avec de la sauce maison pour 5$ le petit (enfin moyen) bol, qui est assez copieux pour 1 repas! A essayer à tout prix si vous aimez les gnoccis!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious Gnocchi!
5$ and 5 Stars! 

Lots of people get this and eat it while waiting in line for Kem Coba. It's a great idea honestly because the line can take up to 30-40 minutes and it doesn't seem long at all if you're eating.

The portion is very generous for one but plan on sharing this because it's way too much for one. The sauce is flavourful and warm, and the parmesan on top is the cherry on top. The gnocchi isn't rubbery/chewy or tough. It's just right. 

I am really satisfied with this little shop. Made with love, it is homemade and authentic. Perfect comfort food."}
{"text":"I was walking by in the neighbourhood and came across this lovely place. The staff was very friendly so I was tempted to buy a few mason jars of their tomato sauce for 10$ each. They also have a spicy sauce 12$ and a veal sauce 15$.

The classic tomato sauce is absolutely delicious I've tried several of these local sauces and this one is great. It has a sweetness to it that is just right and unique. It cab also be kept for a long time in these convenient mason jars."}
{"text":"I didn't even know this place existed, but I am so glad I know now. Located next to two Montreal gems Kem CoBA (ice cream) and Fairmount Bagel I had just assumed that the line was for either of those two places, but as we got closer I discovered that this bustling block is home to another Montreal favorite.

Step right up to Drogheria Fine and for $5 receive a generous portion of fresh made gnocchi with tomato sauce.  Gnocchi served up piping hot and then topped with a generous portion of house made tomato sauce, parmesan cheese and crush red pepper if it's your fancy.  They don't even close up the box, cause they know you will just be clawing to open it up.  It is DELICIOUS and they move along pretty quickly.  A must try, walk up to the window, mid-day snack in the summer, I'm not sure if this location is open in the wintertime.

Rumor has it they sold sandwiches, which didn't appear to be the case here.  They do have another location on Beaubien; I haven't had a chance to check out."}
{"text":"Not much to say about this place, but that it is awesome! A very cool spot to stop in for a snack while exploring the city/neighborhood. I was tipped off about this place from a friend who had visited and am very glad I made the trip to check it out! 

Gnocchi is made fresh literally in the walk up window and served in a huge takeout container for just $5. The gnocchi was delicious and super fresh but the sauce is what shined. Seriously one of the best tomato sauces I've ever had...definitely wanted to take some jars back home with me (was a bit jealous of the 3 people I saw walk in and purchase 10+ jars). 

Cool neighborhood to walk around, definitely recommend a quick snack stop here!"}
{"text":"Just an amazing place. My girlfriend and I were in the neighborhood to go to Fairmount Bagel, and as I stood in line, she waited outside in the alley next door. I got a text while I was nearing the front of the line that said, \"The guy next door is selling takeout containers of gnocchi for $5, want some?\" Anyone who turns an offer like that down belongs in a mental institution. I came out with a bagel, but immediately turned my attention to the gnocchi. I'm not sure if it was the atmosphere we were eating it in (an alley with various rodents and trash cans) that made it taste so good, but it was one of the most memorable meals I had in my time here. We actually headed out down the street, then realized we had to buy some of their homemade sauce. So, we turned right around and bought a jar of sauce. For $10, I can't complain. Will any pasta I make ever be worthy of using it? Probably not."}
{"text":"Waiting in line for Kem Coba? Grab a 5CAD bill and walk 20 steps to Drogheria Fine's window and grab a huge steaming box of gnocchi! Add some chili flakes on top and go to town on the fluffiest gnocchi ever.. the sauce is the perfect consistency and isn't too sweet or acidic. I secretly wish I didn't share the portion but then I wouldn't have had room for ice cream ;) definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"Came across this gem while walking around in little Italy around lunch time. This is a second small location,which also sells items such as sauce,etc. My boyfriend and I split a panini and order of gnocchi and with two drinks for $10 Canadian. You can't beat the taste and the price. I would highly recommend trying it."}
{"text":"Cool little store great authentic Italian gnocchi with sauce and extremely kind workers. Gnocchi was only $5. They also have an insane variety of gourmet sauces to choose from to eat at home. Unfortunately was leaving Montreal the next day otherwise would have bought some."}
{"text":"Another little shop along fairmont that makes tasty things.  For $5 you can have a generous portion of gnocchi in a lovely red sauce.  But be patient, as they get made is small batches!  But a nice thing to split with a friend.  You can get things to go, but it is so nice to be able to buy a great tasting treat out the window.  Makes me wonder if the sauce and gnocchi would be as good at home?  As sitting on a nearby bench enjoying the summer and these little pillows of yumminess is part of the experience.  

Fairmont has little bit of magic as you can move from grilled balony sandwiches, to gnocchi in a warm red sauce, to lovely ice-cream, all within a few short steps.  But how do you fit in the bagels?"}
{"text":"How does this place only have 9 reviews!?

I was visiting Montreal on the weekend and making my obligatory stop to Fairmount Bagel when I saw another line forming at the unit right beside it. After getting a closer look, I found out that it was a guy making fresh gnocchi pomodoro! 

*jumps in line*

Everything was made in house from the gnocchi to the tomato sauce. You also have the option to add as much parmesan cheese and chili flakes as you'd like. We opted for the large size ($8) over the regular $5 portion because we were sharing between 4 people.

The gnocchi was the perfect cross between creamy and chewy, and I loved the tomato sauce. I'm usually more of a fan of white sauce with gnocchi, but this was a major exception.

So glad I made the decision to check it out after getting some bagels next door."}
{"text":"Funky place. Smallest Italian restaurant in the world serving just 1 item, Gnocchi. Served in a Chinese take-out container with an excellent pasta sauce  and plenty of grated cheese on top.

Seating is on the sidewalk outside the restaurant."}
{"text":"The gnocchi was okay and maybe not worth the hype. But, it was only $5 so can't complain. 

The gnocchi was a little too soft for me and the red sauce reminded me of Chef Boyardee. 

They take cash and card, but when we tried to pay with money, we were asked to use a debit card."}
{"text":"While waiting for our table at a nearby restaurant we came across Drogheria and people out front eating gnocchi. We decided to get a pint given our hunger and the $5 cheap price tag. It's a large portion and we paid a dollar for extra cheese. The gnocchi were fine. Nothing special but warm. They were a bit too chewy. Didn't finish it but held off hunger a bit."}
{"text":"Some of the finest gnocchi and tomato sauce! This quaint little hole in the wall joint is such an awesome spot. Definitely check it out."}
{"text":"There's only one thing on the menu and it's $5 so you really can't go too wrong. However, the gnocchi isn't really anything to scream about although I'd still go if you haven't been before for the experience, the Mile End is always worth walking around!  Would recommend if you're in the area looking for a quick and cheap eat!"}
{"text":"Literally the best gnocchi I have ever had in my life! I recommend the cheese gnocchi with spice! These pillows of deliciousness just melt in your mouth. They come in a small Chinese food container, the irony. I could have eaten two! 
This is not a sit down restaurant, which means no AC in the summer, you simply order through a window. There is no place to sit, except the alleyway around the building. We came here on the hottest day in Montreal, but it was worth it! 
You can also buy a jar of their spicy tomato sauce!"}
{"text":"Came to the area for Fairmont bagels and also grabbed their gnocchi as the reviews were quite good. It was cheap, only 5cad for a big portion, however gnocchi was quite stodgy and tasted like it has been cooked for way too long. Will not recommend."}
{"text":"Homemade gnocchi and tomato sauce. Another landmark staple in Montreal. The sauce was simple yet very good. They also make a spicy tomato sauce, but I passed as the man said it has quite a kick.

This joint cooks up other products besides just the tomato sauces. Apparently their olive oil is fantastic. Through the small front window, they serve their famed gnocchi and sauce to the public. As a stop on our food tour, it was a delight. My gnocchi was a bit overcooked but, hey, when you get a steady flow of hungry pedestrians year round, I can't knock it one bit!

The sauces are sold in 1L glass mason jars - cute touch. Their own simple label. Our jars made it home safe and sound to the kitchen cupboard. Now, for the return journey to my mouth...!"}
{"text":"My husband and I walked by this place in search of Fairmount Bagels and couldn't resist the gnocchi takeout window. Save room because the gnocchi is truly wonderful - soft and chewy at the same time, they were good pillowy delivery vehicles for their amazing tomato sauce. The sauce was a bit on the thinner, sweeter side and delicious with a good mixture of olive oil tossed in. Topped off with Parmesan, it was a delicious $8 spent. Do it."}
{"text":"Oh my ever loving God! If you ever find yourself in Montreal you must RUN to Drogheria Fine for their $5 gnocchi - it is the best gnocchi I've ever had in my entire life! Everything is hand made right there in their tiny shop, and La Nonna is there stirring her secret sauce which is to die for! It's flavorful and perfect.

If you've had gnocchi and didn't like it because you thought it was dense or tough or chewy, this is exactly the opposite. It's like eating tiny bites of perfection. I wanted to bring it home with me (and if I didn't fly to Montreal with only carry-on luggage I would have!).

The portion that you get for $5 is really generous. Seriously - try it. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"HEAVEN IS HERE PEOPLE

Fresh gnocchi and tomato sauce made to order by the owner himself right at the window in a pan.

For 5 dollars!!! Insane!!!!! 

Doughy gnocchi, decadent, rich tomato sauce exploding with true Italian flavors. 

I went here twice in four days - this was BY FAR the best food I had in all of Montreal, and I walked and researched and ate my way across the glorious city.

I'm an Italian New Yorker, surrounded by fantastic food and grew up with the best. This is the one spot I wish so much would open by me.

I wish you guys the best. 5 stars!!!!!!!"}

{"text":"YAy and super yum. This tiny cafe houses all the lovingly homemade magic Montrealers will remember from Il Piatto della Nonna back in the day, but in quick, inexpensive and easybreezy cafe form. The staff are still getting their feet under them so yes, the top of my ciabatta sandwich was burned, but honestly that couldn't touch the incredible flavour of the high quality meat and veggies used, and at $5 for the daily sandwich including a coffee I will be back for sure for sure. 

The decor here is also lovely, big think wooden tables, soft light from hanging lamps, and racks of Nonna's homemade sauce in japs for your to take home, plus lasagnes ready for you in the fridge."}
{"text":"Pretty good gnocchi but didn't think it was that amazing. The lady (maybe the restaurant owner along with her husband?) seemed very nice, so I'm giving it another star. I could tell the gnocchi was fresh and homemade. If you're like me and don't like cheese, still get a bit of the parmesan cheese; it actually improves the gnocchi taste a bit (even though I don't like cheese and am perfectly happy with no cheese on my pasta). Warm homemade gnocchi, simple tomato sauce, large and very filling portion for a very affordable $5. Definitely a good deal."}
{"text":"Small take out establishment in The Mile End in Montreal.  5 dollars for a take out portion of Gnocchi.  Sauce is simple but so delicious,  gnocchi is just right.... They also sell jarred sauce and olive oil.  Gem in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I didn't get the hype. You have a cup of homemade gnocchis for CAN$5, but these are not authentic potato gnocchis - they are not as soft and fluffy. Tomato sauce also comes from a can (from their own brand though, that I understand is sold at the shop). Overall, it is a good quick meal, but this is not an authentic Italian experience."}
{"text":"Pros:
- Great quick and cheap food
- Service was pretty quick
- Nice shaded seating areas outside the restaurant
- $5 after tax!

Cons:
- This is preference but the sauce was a bit too tart for my taste

Ordered:
$5 Nonna's Gnocchi

Conclusion:
If your'e hungry and close by, Drogheria Fine is a great place to stop by for some simple, quick, tasty and cheap. We were welcomed by who I presume is Nonna. She scooped us a good portion of her gnocchi and topped it off with some parm, which was $5 flat. The gnocchi was soft and chewy, and the sauce was smooth and tart, although a little too tart for my preference of tomato sauce (I still ate it all lol). I'd recommend Drogheria Fine"}
{"text":"Pour n'avoir jamais mangé de gnocchis auparavant, j'ai été très agréablement surpris ! Pour environ 3 (CAD$5), vous pourrez déguster une succulente portion de gnocchis à la sauce tomate faite maison saupoudrée de parmesan. Définitivement un must si vous passez dans le quartier (ce que je vous recommande car il y a pleins de choses à goûter/visiter dans Mile-End).

P.S. Par contre, Atos a décidé de bloquer ma carte bancaire quand j'ai voulu payer à cet établissement, donc méfiez-vous et préférez le cash si vous en avez ! (On ne sait jamais)"}
{"text":"Such a great idea. Fluffy gnocchi in tomato sauce with Romano cheese on top served in a Chinese take out box. $5. No choices, no decisions, just boom; delicious food, fast.

Highlights: Everything about this"}
{"text":"Very interesting little hole in the wall, like literally a hole in the wall. We came here as part of the Mile End food tour and we all loved it! 

The business started as a red sauce maker and we were told that a while back, because of the food tour, the owner started making gnocchi to taste the sauce. Rumor has it that passerby wanted gnocchi too and the owner figured it would be cool to cook gnocchi outside the window of the store. It worked. The gnocchi were great and the sauce fabulous!"}
{"text":"This place is small and it's for takeout. They only have one thing and one flavor there: gnocchi in tomato sauce. It's $5, so it's pretty cheap. The gnocchi is a bit chewy and I like it. The tomato sauce is good too as it tastes like it's made from real tomatoes instead of from tomato cans. It's a bit salty to me though."}
{"text":"5$ for a tasty healthy pasta how can I not be a fan? Usualyy they have a long line (which also mean fresh food). Their sauce is a little too salty so you might want to ask for just a pinch of Parmesan cheese."}
{"text":"Passed by this place and remembered reading it was a must try. For 5 CAD it was well worth it. The sauce was delicious as well as the gnocchi. The gnocchi is made out of wheat and potato. It was extremely filling could barely finish it but made sure I did anyway."}
{"text":"This is a great family-owned little gnocchi shop. I love that you just walk up to the window and order, that they only sell gnocchi, and that Nonna herself is in cooking her family recipe most days. 
For $5 you get a warm, tasty, authentic meal that really fills you up. I only tried the regular tomato sauce, but apparently there is a spicy one! I added some pepper flakes to mine and enjoyed the kick. The gnocchi is some of the best I've ever had, and the sauce is decent (but not the best I've had). For $5, great meal!"}
