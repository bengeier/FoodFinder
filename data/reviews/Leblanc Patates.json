{"text":"Local diner, serving greasy but comforting fare such as hot dogs, poutine and hot chicken. Local business appreciated by the locals because of the cheap prices ($1.59 for a steamed dog), the pleasant service and the no-fuss seating room, which has more in common with cafeterias than restaurants. I ordered two steamed dogs, generously topped with coleslaw, and a small fries, and the whole meal only cost around $5. The fries are typical from any greasy spoon diner, so order the poutine if you have a bigger appetite than mine. There is a makeshift patio on the outside.for sunny days."}
