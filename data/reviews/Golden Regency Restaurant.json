{"text":"I've seen pictures on FB of the dimsum people had in Toronto.  It looks so delicious, unlike our dimsum's here.  So my husband and myself went to try some for breakfast.  My sister had a horrendous dye job the day before, so we went back to Pacific Mall to fix that up.  Out of convenience, we decided to eat here.  The place was not packed, but it was old and dirty.  There were clutters of chairs, and table cloths all over the place. The ceiling was low, and the lights cast off an awkward color.  But to my surprise the food was pretty decent.    I like Congee, so I order a bowl, and damn that bowl of congee was just huge.  It was enough to feed my husband and myself, and possibly my sister.  I also ordered \"\" which is \"Chaozhou dumpling\" since they were my favorite.  And I love it.  It was big, the wrapping was thin, and the filling was heavy.  However, the rest of the dimsum was just \"meh\".  3 STARS for cheap decorations, old lights, low ceiling, clutter areas, and mediocre dimsum."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for dim sum more so for its convenience than food since it's in Pacific Mall.  The last time I went here was probably the most \"meh\" experience. The dim sum here is usually okay but there were a couple stand outs (for not so good reasons) this time. The \"steamed rice noodle with fresh dough wrap\" wasn't fresh at all. The dough fritters were very hard so it was probably re-fried. My family didn't even finish the one plate we ordered.  I also found their dumpling wraps very sticky so when you picked one up, the skin would tear and the filling would fall out.  One interesting dish that I actually liked was the green tea pancake (picture uploaded).  It's not really a pancake, it's more so a dough ball stuffed with a green tea filling. It was pretty good as it wasn't too sweet and I liked the doughy texture of the 'pancake'.   Service is sufficient...but take that with a grain of salt as I have lower standards for Chinese places."}
{"text":"Competent Chinese Dimsum at reasonable prices.  Nothing really stood out, but then again, nothing to complain about.  The service, however, was terrible.  Took forever for them to come and serve us tea.  Given the vast array of choices in the GTA, they need to do better."}
{"text":"Went for dim sum with whole family; the service is exceptionally poor, the quality of food questionable and poor selection. When paying with debit card at the cash counter I asked if they took customer feedback, an older lady sitting in the corner offered a resounding NO. Do not recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"A room full of Chinese people can't be wrong. I thought the dim sum was pretty good."}
{"text":"Having spent an entire day shopping and munching away at Pacific Mall, my parents and I stepped inside Golden Regency Restaurant (located inside the mall) for a somewhat late lunch. The restaurant decor is quite impressive, and from the looks of the dining area, it seemed like a popular place for weddings and celebrations; in fact, servers were too caught up in preparing for an upcoming wedding reception to pay attention to the diners. It made the whole dining experience seem rather awkward as they had to dodge tables here and there while setting up the furniture and such.  The food itself wasn't so remarkable. None of the dim sum platter particularly stood out and I'd go as far to say that I've had better dim sum in Columbus. The char siu not only lacked sweetness but the artificial red color as well. The seafood and bean curd hot pot was okay - certainly nothing out of the ordinary.  \"Skip GRR and check out the innumerable eating options inside Pacific Mall instead!\" says this FOB ^_^V"}
{"text":"this review is long overdue. my friends and i ate here once during our trip to toronto, and we enjoyed the food. we would definitely come back here whenever we take another vacation."}
{"text":"For Good Dim Sum @ Pacific Mall head over here :)  Great Shrimp Dumplings, Good Beef Rice Crepes and Shrimp Rice Crepes, egg tarts and hom sui gok (might be fried tarot).  I have no idea the name of it in English (who's got bad english now lol).  Bad Tarot Cake (the flat ones)  Service was not that great, english was not good and they were not able to get stuff happily, they always looked like we were bothering them when we asked for stuff and they don't have things like sugar ... really?"}
{"text":"Decent place to have dim sum, this place is huge and gets pretty busy. Sometimes they have weddings events going on, too. Typical traditional decor.  The last time I went here was with a group of 4 on a Saturday afternoon. We went in at around 230, so Dim sum (and lunch, too) was ending soon. So we   quickly found a couple dishes.   I am not a dim sum lover, so the food was just decent to me. They have all the typical dim sum dishes, and some specials too. The food came pretty quick (probably because they wanted us outta there fast). So service was also just decent.   This might be a good place to have large group meals (since it's the only real restaurant in the mall). The restaurants scattered outside of the mall might be a better option though."}
{"text":"I been to Golden Regency Restaurant for dim sum a couple of time. I have to agreed with my fellow yelpers. It is ok.. the food is ok, the price is ok, the service is ok...  I am back to the restaurant last Saturday for a banquet style dining experience. The event is organized by a Buddhist organization and they took over the whole venue and the menu serves only vegetarian dishes.  This place can be crowded with 40 tables of over 400 people at the same time! The tables are all closely packed together and it does feel crowded with the low ceiling! I have to say the sound system here really suck! Not only the venue are not designed for that and the system is not working probably as it is!  It must be quite a challenge for the chef to come up with all different vegetarian dishes. Ended up most of them used the same ingredient: celery! 4 dishes in a roll has celery in it! (OK, it is personal, I don't eat celery!) In order the make the dish not as bland, a lot of MSG has been used. (OK! I was thirsty the whole night)  Our table has this quick and efficient waiter! Not only we are the first one to be served in our section and he even let me took photos of the dishes before he served us! Thank so much!  Since the meal is complimentary from the buddhist organization, I could not really comment on the value. However, our table did have a good time!"}
