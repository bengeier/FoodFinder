{"text":"The worst dining experience I've had in Toronto - and my friends agreed.

The waiter brought me the wrong dish, and tried to convince me that it was correct, even though it was clearly the next item on the menu (soup based vs. noodle based). I stopped debating and decided to bite my tongue.

One friend almost broke a tooth on their General Tsao's chicken.

My other friend asked for crispy noodles, they came raw.

The waiter asked us if we would like a side of rice, we asked if it was free and he said yes. However, it was added to the bill at the end.

When paying at the counter, we noticed a cockroach on the floor...

They offered a \"VIP card\" for our next visit... which will be never."}
{"text":"9.99 lunch special advertised outside.  

I go in check the extra long menu and 9.99 is for a vip special.  13.50 regular price.  Since I sat down I thought I would give it a try.  

Waited for a bit, got the hot and sour soup and it was regular, maybe spicier than others. Still good.   

Main - nothing special.  Food plopped on the plate still finished it.  

Chicken wing in a skewer looked good,  seasoning on the skin is like a cumin steak spice...but one bite and it was very bloody.  I'm thirsty now and sat down for 20 minutes.  No one checks in with me, no water and I didn't get the drink I ordered.  I had to get up and help myself to the fridge they have beside the counter.  

Finished my meal before waiting for the dessert cause I think they forgot anyways.  Cashier was on the phone that sounded personal and she gives me the bill for the table beside which was 5 times the amount of food I ordered.  This place disgusts me from FOH to BOH.  

Sevice is horrible. .food is overpriced.  Much rather go to Chinatown.   Washrooms are disgusting.   I feel if they are going to serve the same food a block away have a better washrooms, better service and make sure the food is cooked when coming out.   

I would never dine here again."}
{"text":"Food is on point and delicious but you may end up paying more than what you should. BE CAREFUL.

We purchased 3 food items, hot and sour soup $7.99, sliced beef with onions $10.95, and lamb screwer $5.99. The bill should come out as ~$28 with 13% tax included. However, the picture (show below) is what we had. Before tip is $31.61 instead of $28, and the bill does not show individual food item. Didn't realize we had been overcharged until we paid. 

There will be no next time! Always watch your bill people!!"}
{"text":"Was walking around the neighborhood and found this little place. Was looking to eat something quickly and the workers mentioned they could be quick. They definitely lived up to it! We were in and out in less than 30 minutes!Decent food for the most part. Ordered the following: 

Duck in beer marinade: 3/5 - great marinade but not too much duck meat. Wish it was a little more portion wise. 
Chicken wings in Coca Cola marinade: 3.5/5 - sweet and savory! Surprised I liked this more than the duck! 

The staff was super nice but difficult to understand. The owner came around and gave us VIP membership for free. Guess when you're VIP you get the discounted price for the foods. Pretty solid deal! 
 
As for ambiance, it needs a little work. The restaurant was very dark and needs light. Decent place with a nice staff."}
{"text":"$13 lunch special: entree+soup+soft drink +spring rolls(or kebab). Sounds like a good deal right?

Had Kung Pao shrimp for entree, turned out there was only four shrimps in the dish. Also, what makes you think it's acceptable to serve shrimp that is not deveined?"}
{"text":"Not very busy even on a popular street but they have good food, reasonable prices, and knowledgeable servers. Good for groups and for trying many kinds of spicy, Chinese grilled dishes, tapas style. Recommend lamb skewers and grilled cabbage."}
{"text":"Hidden gem on Baldwin. The barbeque skewers are the best in Chinatown. The combos are great values. Highly recommend you check this place out."}
{"text":"FYI - their new name is Season Chinese Restaurant. Although the food is relatively cheap compared to many legit Chinese BBQ spots, you certainly get what you pay for. The food was below my expectations - the skewers were not flavourful enough and lacked the distinct grilled smoky taste. The vegetables were too salty and the garlic flavour was too strong. The Dan Dan noodles were tasty but didn't resemble the authentic dish at all. Their Mouthwatering Chicken however, was delicious. 

We were offered two free VIP cards as we were paying, which is very kind of the staff. The service was good despite the language barrier as well - just remember to always bring your token Asian friend to dim sum!"}
{"text":"This place is overpriced.  Way more expensive than other bbq places in the area. 

The food is ok,  but nothing incredible. Especially for that price. 

Even if the place is not busy,  the service is terribly slow. 

I won't come back and not recommend it."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying first and foremost, that a restaurant's experience is often judged on multiple fronts. From the food to the ambience, to the experience of the staff. When you look at Sometime Cafe, while it exceeds in one area, it lacks in another. Here's my thoughts.

What this restaurant shines primary is the food itself. In my years of visiting downtown Chinatown, there is not one restaurant that can match the authenticity of this restaurant's Szechuan menu, and that's something this city sorrowfully needs. The menu is vibrant with classic dishes such as spicy boiled fish, Yu-Xiang pork, and Mapo Tofu, all of which were delicious. The food is liberally seasoned and packs a punch with the authentic ma-la spicy flavour that Szehcuan food is known for. Service was just as good, with all the dishes arriving one after another in a quick succession.

But here's where the restaurant starts to show it's downsides. The decor and lighting of the place reminded me of those 'fly' restaurants in Chengdu, China, where the walls are cement bricks, and boxes of ingredients placed everywhere. Perhaps they were going through a renovation, but it certainly looked grim. The washroom is also in serious need of lighting, it was dirty and incredibly dim and a feeling of unease. The overall ambience is not even representative of a normal Chinese restaurant. Instead, it's feels hard to enjoy their deliciously cooked food in such a tacky environment.

They also implemented a VIP system, a gift card of sorts, which offers you lower price on most items if you use the reloadable card. While it is a good incentive for people to return, it offered more confusion than value. Stick with one menu price and price aggressively.


TL;DR Finally a restaurant true to Szechuan cooking with delicious foods and offerings. But the confusion of the VIP system, and the tacky decor speaks volume to the restaurant's infancy and seriousness."}
