{"text":"I recently had a wistful desire to dine at Vivo again, after a long hiatus.  This hiatus was not for distaste, but for a mixture of emotional evasion (this was a spot I frequented with my ex-husband) and relative poverty (well... rebuilding a new life after divorce will sometimes do that to a person).  Such a long hiatus that I must confess, the last time I was at Vivo, it was located in the then-dry town of Bellevue ( ... live ... worship ... shop ... ).

So these are my caveats, the context within which this meal was appreciated, influences that may have guided my perception beyond just the flavors and textures of the meal itself.  Just so ya know!

I didn't have a bad meal here.  It just didn't live up to my memory.  Typical response I suppose, but there were a couple of explicit changes that I sorely miss that had previously catapulted this restaurant from delivering your standard, delicious, expensive, fancy meal, up to delivering a unique, warm, cultural, and individualized experience that you couldn't hope to get anywhere else.  In my opinion, if you have the ability to deliver such an experience to your guest, it means so much more than just making good food.  The good food didn't change, the experience did.

So, wah wah, I miss the pre-dinner pasta course, and the post-dinner salad course (the old italian way!), and the personally delivered by voice small menu (never was there ever a printed menu before the move).  I miss the cozy, closed in feel, the soft glow of table lamps, the cramped quarters of camaraderie in fine dining.  I miss the feeling of mixing luxury with secret-ness and surprise.  The masterful chef still makes an effort to come to your table to say hello, a small vestige of the-way-things-used-to-be.

Ah, well maybe the restaurant has just been Sewickley'ed.

Now, if I take a look with fresh eyes, like its a totally new restaurant ... the space is undoubtedly a nice space, with a cool bar one can also dine at, high open ceilings, warm yet bare drop lights, plenty of rearrangable space to accommodate any size group, wood tables, tile floor, knowledgeable and attentive waitstaff, and nice big glass walls that look out onto a gorgeous courtyard that is probably a true al fresco delight in the warmer months.  Its offerings include an amazing and extensive wine and booze list and a menu of delightful appetizers, entrees, and desserts, some of which were offered even in the-way-back-when, and were all no doubt expertly crafted.  

For appetizers, we had Octopus Piment D' Espellette (which I had recalled being tasty in the past) and some sauteed fancy mushrooms, both of which were good.  I rather liked the octopus, in particular the feel of the meat, which was definitely in the meaty category of feels, as opposed to the rubberyness that many people fear.  It was so meaty, it was almost like slices of turkey stamped into octopus rounds.  I quite liked it, but my companion was not as much a fan of this, as he felt like it was less authentically octopus-y.  Flavor-wise, perfect.  The mushrooms were, of course, delicious, but nothing to write home about (though they did inspire me to sauté my own fancy mushrooms for the next night's Sunday Dinner, which turned out just as good if I do say so myself, and now I will be doing it all the time!).  One note - the mushrooms came with a dollop of a blue cheese, which I did not find necessary or additive, but I ate it just the same, and was easily avoidable.

Choosing the entree was difficult for me, because my past experiences have taught me that everything, meat and fish alike, is cooked superbly.  My dining companion got the Elk Filet, cooked rare, and it was, to me, very good, reminding me of a time that I ate reindeer in Helsinki.  I wish I'd gotten it, instead of my veal chop, which was just fine.  I also wish I'd gotten the fish, or the flat iron steak.  Eh, maybe veal just isn't my thing (I think this after every time I eat veal, so I should probably just stop trying it, because if it doesn't blow my socks off at Vivo, then its probably just not my favorite thing).  So, while I am sure it was good, I can't say I loved it.

Some final notes, if you are considering going here for a dinner some time.  It is fine dining, but blissfully not suit-and-tie dining.  You should dress nicely, but it is still basically a casual place.  Don't wear a jersey, but you don't have to go crazy combing your hair just right.  But if you did, you wouldn't look out of place either.  They didn't have my old favorite dessert, but what they offered was good, and all made in house, so if you are a sugar nut, you are sure to be satisfied.  In general, you are sure to have a solidly GOOD meal here.  It is just not as special as it used to be.  C'est la vie!

SNEAKY TIP: 
Go back in time to 2008!  Jussssst kidding.  We can't do that!  But if you are like me and miss that feel, just forget it ever was, go in with fresh new eyes and tongue, and chat with the chef."}
{"text":"Delicious food in a beautiful restaurant. The owner/chef makes you feel welcome and it is clear that he pays attention to the details.  Yes, you you will pay a little more to dine here. It's an upscale restaurant and well worth it.  The patio area is lovely and includes a fire feature.  I have been here a few times and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Read Jack L.'s review - had exactly the same experience.  I don't mind splurging, but lukewarm food and lukewarm service is not what you expect from a $$$$ restaurant."}
{"text":"Two words adequately describe this place: Rip-off. Basically it's a fansy fasade for a very petite restaurant with small portioned,  mediocre food at best. 

We made the mistake of trying a new restaurant on Valentine's Day and unfortunately we were left grossly disappointed. I think all of the positive reviews of this place must be from staffers and relatives since I completely disagree. I suppose if we were inebriated enough to not  notice that it took about 45 minutes just to get our main entree which was small and almost room temperature would have had a better review of this place. 

First of all, I made a reservation a month in advance to make sure we got a table and when we arrived another couple that came in after us were almost seated ahead of us since they appeared to be friends of the owner. The lady that greeted us at the door was cold and rude, not something I would expect for an establishment like this. She said our table wasn't ready yet, but there were three two tops in plain site that were unoccupied at the moment. She asked if we'd like to wait at the bar which had zero available seats which seemed pretty idiotic, so we declined. After we watched her grab a rag, wipe down the table, and set out silverware we were seated at a two top right next to the bar. When I say right next to the bar, I mean there wasn't even a foot of clearance between one of the bar stools and my husband's chair.

The ambiance was okay, but a little too dark for our liking since we could barely see our food. When I say this place was small, I'm not joking. It's basically the size of a large den with maybe an 8 foot bar in it. Seating was way too tight, even our waitress had a hard time getting to us. 

We asked our waitress to make an Arnold Palmer which took the bar like 20 minutes to make (it's not brain surgery). Appetizers were very good actually - we shared the Burrata, tomato, arugula, flatbread. It started out good and I honestly really wanted to like this place, but then almost 45 minutes went by after we finished our appetizer until our main course arrived. They also served us some bread with olive oil which was good, but again very small portions. The pieces of bread were very tiny.

For our main course my husband ordered the Ribeye medium rare and I ordered the Lamb Chops medium well. The menu was quite vague (no photos or graphics of any kind) and the vegetables that came with both of our meals were spare and unrecognizable. I did notice that cauliflower came with mine since the waitress mentioned it when she brought our food and unfortunately I don't really care for it, so I just slid those three pieces to the side of my plate. I know lamb chops are sometimes not all that meaty, but I had maybe four bites of meat in my entire meal. The majority of my meal was bone and inedible. My husband enjoyed his steak and it was cooked correctly (not very hot temperature wise though) although that's pretty much all he got. The plates were very sparse on any sort of sides.  Seasoning was almost non-existent and bland. Both dishes were barely above room temperature which lends me to believe that they sat for quite sometime before our waitress picked them up. There were also no candles, condiments, salt or pepper on the tables. Nothing.

We barely saw our waitress all night (we saw the other waitresses, so I guess we drew the short stick) and would have loved a refill on ours drinks, but she would only bring us water twice. She also switched our water over to tap water at the later part of our meal (I could taste the chlorine).

The whole meal took about an hour and a half and we didn't even get dessert. We wanted to, but feared it would take another hour to get it. My husband had to ask for the check since we sat for what seemed like forever after we finished our entree and it was getting late. 

We shared an appetizer, both had Arnold Palmers to drink (1 each), and had 2 entrees and it came to almost $90 excluding gratuity. Way over priced for a lousy experience.  Don't waste your time and hard earned money on this place. You can go somewhere else for half the cost and be perfectly satiated."}
{"text":"My wife and I and another couple ate at Vivo's last night to celebrate our friends birthday.   It was truly exceptional from beginning to end.   We were sat immediately with our 7p reservation.   Service was excellent.   I had the Norwegian scriel fish dish which I never had before but it was prepared perfectly with a great taste.   My wife had the flat iron steak which she enjoyed and Which I tasted and agreed it was cooked perfectly and tasted excellent.   We also ordered several appetizers which were all tasty especially the arugula flatbread and Brussels Sprouts.  We brought our own wine.  Ambiance was just ok, it was noisy in the small restaurant which I didn't mind but it caused you to talk louder to be heard."}
{"text":"We were very disappointed with our visit. We made reservations weeks in advance for our First Anniversary dinner here, and even asked for an outside table. We got there an hour earlier and decided to sit at the bar and get drinks. The older lady (guessing an owner) was right off the bat rude when we checked in. Anyway, we went to the bar and had our drinks. The whole time we could hear the lady complaining about someone or the other to some of the customers, which looked liked regulars. Over an hour past (it was fifteen past our reservations) but they didn't come get us for our dinner. The place was not busy either, and we had closed our bar tab a while before. So we go up and ask to be seated. They take us to a small corner table indoors, up against the wall. When we asked why we aren't seated outside, the lady got rude again and said that there is no note about wanting to sit outside and all the tables are full, which was clearly a lie because we could see them empty. We asked about switching to another table inside and same excuse. By now I was upset because you should not treat customers like this and she never once apologized. So I pointed to an empty table for two and said I want to sit there. The lady grumbled under her breathe but finally gave in. 
The food and wait staff were good, but for the price you get better quality food, and service, in the city (Pittsburgh). We definitely will not go back. It is a shame because it is one of the few places near us and we had high hopes for it."}
{"text":"Fabulous meal! The pork belly & fig melts in your mouth.  The sushito peppers are perfect.  Dessert is to die for!  Salted caramel cheesecake & flourless chocolate cake are both gluten free & fabulous! Thank you, Lori & Sam for a truly spectacular evening."}
{"text":"This is a definite splurge place.  It was about $60 per person including starters, drinks, entrees, dessert and coffee.  Though the place looked promising, it failed to deliver on some pretty critical areas.

The criteria for finding a restaurant for a dinner date was that we needed to be close to home with a babysitter on the clock and it had to be an Open Table restaurant as I had a $20 dining cheque that was expiring soon.  Vivo Kitchen totally seemed to fit the bill.

But to quickly summarize a disappointing evening:
1) Overpriced - starters were in the $9+ range and they were not great.  My wife had a salad which was fair and I had the foie gras bone marrow butter - both were in at $9 each and both were totally underwhelming.  The entrees were in the $20+ range.  Both were OK.  

2) Uneven service - sometimes our server was available, other times she was no where to be found.  

3) Just above average food - considering the price tag, everything was just OK.  Not what you are looking for when your dinner check rivals an evening out at Morton's.  It just didn't deliver.  I had the veal and my wife had the scallops.  Again, it just tasted above average.  At the price, it should have delivered and then some.  

The only bright spot was that I scored the wine carafe of Merlot for $10.  This was the smartest thing I did all night at VIvo.  Even after $20 off with my Open Table dining cheque, the meal was at $60 per person.  

Don't be fooled by the glamorous surroundings of Vivo.  Unless you have money burning a hole in your pocket to blow on an overrated meal, just stay away."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Vivo Kitchen on Saturday night with our nephew.  It was a beautiful night and many people were enjoying alfresco dining in the beautiful gated courtyard lined with fresh herbs.  
We sat inside and the small bar was hopping with friendly conversation; some people enjoying drinks, some people enjoying starters, and even some people eating dinner. 
 Our dinner was excellent.  I actually made a meal of the starters.  I started with a beet salad accompanied by a plum ricotta.  The taste was phenomenal; the plum ricotta was unlike anything I have ever tasted.  I followed the course with grilled scallops on a half shell with Mango chutney.  All three of us enjoyed the local fried egg with bacon jam and grilled bread - delicious.  This dish was a great pairing from Chef Sam.  My last course was mushrooms and gorgonzola.  I should say this has always been my favorite starter.  I have always loved a pairing of mushrooms and cheese, and this dish did not disappoint.   My husband had the Arctic Char for his main course.  It was cooked perfectly and was topped with Rhubarb Chutney.  Lori's homemade desserts are always special.  We shared tastes of the ricotta tart and two different gelato flavors- yummy.  Overall we loved the ambiance and the food.  The wait staff was attentive and friendly.  And it is always nice to see Chef Sam break away from the kitchen to talk with the people enjoying their meals.    A great neighborhood gem for small plates and or for dinner!  As we were leaving,  the fire feature in the courtyard was lit adding a beautiful glow to the courtyard   Stop in for dinner, or small plates and a drink.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and amazing food.  The server offered suggestions (at our request) and we were not disappointed.  Awesome place for a date night or dinner out with friends!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite restaurant in town.  Service is amazing, cocktails are made with care by Josh and Rox and Sam and Laurie make sure you are wel cared for -- from reservations to the meal to dessert and beyond.  Our favorites:  moscow mule and dirty martini (yes...with blue cheese olives!), the butter lettuce with truffle oil salad, any of the other small plates and dinners, and dont forget the carmel cheesecake for dessert.  Love love love."}
{"text":"STYLISH BUT DISAPPOINTING.

After an odd conversation about getting a reservation and being told to be out by 8:00 P.M., I agreed and arrived on time. . After we said we are here for our 6:30 P.M. reservation, the first thing out of the owners mouth was \" you do realize you have to be out by 8.\" No welcome to Vivo...  We said yes and were showed  to a table near the cold front door. 

The restaurant was stylish with cork floors, small bar and lots of light, fun lighting and a view of the kitchen. 

The rest was downhill from there with few highlights.  Feeling rushed we ordered appetizers and they were good but very slow coming out of the kitchen. They were obviously in the weeds.  The cocktails were great and spot on.

The  nice server kept apologizing for the delay and how was everything for the 5th or 6th time with no entrees appearing with just 17 minutes before we had to be out, I asked if the hostess was the manager or owner and she said YES is there a problem?, to which I responded yes.
I have been in the restaurant business for almost 35 years and have never had such a smug, defensive  employee yet the owner of an establishment treat a customer so poorly.

With 16 minutes left to being ousted, the entrees finally arrived. Two were barely warm and one was not done correctly. Then to add insult to injury the server said, \" I heard my service was not up to par and there will be no service charge in an angry tone.

I later talked to the owner and told her about the disappointment of the evening and the unacceptable attitude of the server at which time the husband , chef, owner, came over in a combative mood unable to take constructive criticism and literaly asked me to step outside.
I complied thinking we would talk and was asked to leave in a threatening manner.  I did so around 8:01 honoring my agreement to being gone by 8:00 P.M. unlike  Vivo providing a nice dinner, good service and  a pleasant social evening.

The entire evening could not have been more unprofessional and inhospitable.  Do not waste your time nor money at this overpriced restaurant with poor service and poor quality of cuisine. The owners do not understand hospitality nor have the ability to take constructive criticism.

I had friends that have had similar experiences thus validating my experience."}
{"text":"Really good food and the best Moscow Mules in Pittsburgh. Sit at the bar. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"My third time for dinner there. Love the extensive \"starter\" menu. Totally enjoyed the pear salad with pomegranate dressing, grilled shrimp with baked grape relish, and my most favorite short ribs. Atmosphere has a great vibe and someone from the kitchen always visits your table to make sure you are as happy as the food is beautiful and delicious. Can't wait for the weather to improve so that I can enjoy dinner and cocktails outdoors in the charming courtyard."}
{"text":"The meal was expertly crafted. The beet salad starter was a thing of beauty and wonder. The lamb chops, simply divine. 

The service, however, made this a mediocre experience. No energy, a lack of interest and a generally short and rude approach was surprising in what was otherwise an out of this world meal. 

Recommended, but with caution. At $50 a plate patrons should expect to be treated with more class."}
{"text":"Within hours of posting my review, I received a call from the restaurant. I simply declined a gift card, as I had purchased one at another restaurant in Sewickley. There was no attempt to discuss how to better this process to ensure this doesn't happen to another consumer. Regardless, I was planning to update my review and rating given they at least followed up, and would have amended it had I eaten there.  However, today I received an angry message that alluded to my assumed private conversation with whomever called me last week.  Given that, I think it's reasonable to assume it is from someone closely associated with or employed by the restaurant. I was told whomever called me was on vacation. Though, unless the restaurant was totally closed, a lack of response seems a tad bit unreasonable, especially when the site implies a quick response. Had complete closure been the actual case, I'd be more than happy to delete my review as I would feel it was unreasonable to leave it. But, today's message made me reconsider.  Because I don't believe in criticism without solution, I will offer some helpful suggestions: 1) Please send a message to a consumer if you are in fact on vacation or the restaurant is closed (or update the website). 2) Or, please recognize you offer a service that you should honor (\"A Vivo Kitchen representative will contant you as soon as possible.\" You may also want to edit that.)  3) Ask your consumers how to improve. Regardless, these sorts of messages (in a form of a compliment, thank you!) has ensured that I will maintain a 1-star review. This is a disappointing response from this business."}
{"text":"We went here randomly on a Friday. First of all, you should make reservations.... We did not, but they sat us at the bar. The bartender is AMAZING! He really was the calm through the storm when they got slammed with 3 big tables in this very small restaurant. He made drinks and waited on us like it was nothing. 

Food was pretty tasty. LOVED the ricotta peas MMMmmmmm. Scallops were good as well. We also tried the ice cream and chocolate cake, and both were really good. 

This place is a tad on the expensive side, but it is Sewickley, so that is expected. Overall great experience, and we will be back."}
{"text":"Vivo is a solid fine-dining experience in the heart of Sewickley. The patio is beautiful and relaxing on a summer night. The escargot and brussels sprout starters were perfectly executed. And the main dishes of shrimp and steak were flavorful and well positioned. Presentation / plating was beautiful. Service was great, the atmosphere was charming. All in all, the entire meal was wonderful!"}
{"text":"We had the dry scallops, lamb chops.  Both were tender and delicious.  For drinks we ordered a Cosmo and Amaretto Sour, both very cold and hit the spot.  Service was friendly and attentive.  Not an inexpensive place ,but worth the splurge once in a while.
."}
{"text":"My favorite place in Pittsburgh! The food is amazing and the staff is so professional. My favorites include the burrata flat bread, shishito peppers and butter lettuce. All of the entrees are delicious and so creative."}
{"text":"Started charging surprise fees of $12 to share your food with your kids. Highly disappointing!"}
{"text":"Eaten here several times. Food is always excellent - beyond excellent - in some cases, it was truly outstanding. Service has been excellent to mediocre. I've had servers who went out of there way to provide service - going so far as to snap a picture of the brand of olive oil they use so I could purchase it in the Strip. I've also had servers that ignored us and just didn't stay on top of things."}
{"text":"We came here because of the great reviews. Oh my gosh, it was like eating oil with every dish. The bread with oil was good. Then came the salad which tasted like the bread because it was full of oil. Then came my chicken which was dipped in oil and tasted like a salad which tasted like the bread. The fish was from Louisiana and was supposed to be slightly more fishy than a non-fishy fish. Well let me tell you this fish was as fishy as fishy gets. And what is worse they charged us for everything. Personally, I would never go back to this restaurant. And as we were trying to very gently and calmly explain to our waitress how bad everything was one of the owners of the restaurant came and rescued her from our explanation. She whisked her away And then she came back and offered us a dessert which was supposed to be drizzled in balsamic vinaigrette and we declined and ordered the straight strawberry gelato which was good. I simply cannot imagine a strawberry gelato drizzled with balsamic vinaigrette. Especially after the Epicurean disaster which just took place in my mouth. 5 thumbs down. Nice place. Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"A group of friends celebrated New Year's Eve at Vivo with the prix fixe menu.  We've been going to this restaurant since it began in Bellevue.  The atmosphere is warm and inviting, the food is fresh and very well prepared... an interesting and delicious interpretation of Italian food. The service was well-paced and especially courteous.  And, the owners walk through the restaurant frequently to see if customers are having a good dining experience.  Many reasons to return to Vivo."}
{"text":"Dinner tonight was another excellent experience. We stuck to appetizers, the butter lettuce salad, mini lobster tails, and mozzarella flatbread. Also, we couldn't resist the salted caramel desert. As usual everything was excellent including service. The only complaint was that it was a little too loud, which is a bit of an issue here, particularly on weekends. Tonight we sat next to a table of self important young guys. Maybe I was like them one day."}
{"text":"The wine was the best part of our experience tonight. The servers ability to pour it was less than inept. The menu, that seems to be the same menu, with minimal changes need updating. Our server was so friendly and courteous but lacked professionalism. With not much to choose from, we will return. Vivo is a 3.5 out of 5 but could easily be a 5 with a few changes."}
{"text":"Vivo! This place is a dump!! What a terrible experience from the time we walked into the  small gloomy whole in the wall establishment. The hostess who was actually one of the owners, was rude from the moment we set foot in the place. The bartender was unfriendly, but the worst was the waiter who was the rudest, had no personality, and had no idea what was on the drink menu and was annoyed when I asked what was on tap! When I made the reservation, they did not bother to say thwy had a prix fixe menu, a d it woukdnt have mattered except that 2course had seafood and my campanion is alergic. They at first refused to accomodate her diet, but then reluctantly agreed to replace a course with a lobster tail, shrimp, and crab wifh a few strands of spaghetti squash and had the audacity to charge the same price for the dish. Food allergies are not uncommon and any decent establishment is prepared to make accomodations without giving an attitude about it, but not so at Vivo apparently."}
{"text":"Loved it here. The space is very inviting and attractive. The outdoor seating is lovely. We sat indoors and the windows were wide open on the first warm night of the year and had a fabulous dinner. This really feels like you step outside the village of Sewickley and into a successful urban eatery. 

Brussels sprouts and mushrooms desserts were very well executed. I love Brussels sprouts and these were especially good. For dinner I had the porterhouse steak which came out over top of a nice plating of spaghetti squash. The steak was phenomenal and perfectly rare. Everyone at the table loved their meals. Next time I'll get the scallops which looked really good. 

Dessert- gelatos! We all had one scoop of malted chocolate and one scoop of Heath. Both were really good. 

Service was great. The venue is loud and it was sometimes hard to communicate with the waiter. He did put out a small carafe of water for me- which was a bonus."}
{"text":"The service staff is fantstic.  You can tell that they love working at this place because the owners are so great to work for!

Great food too.  The Chef is incredible and even came out to our table to ask us what we thought!  

People who don't like this place ARE the problem!"}
{"text":"Sam has always done simple and elegant food, and continues to in this newest location. Service is on point. One of the best dining experiences in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"there were four of us and had resv. we're initialed taken to a small four top near the bar, but I declined as the bar had two patrons seated in bar chairs very close to the table. opted instead for two two tops pulled together near the entrance to the kitchen. no tablecloths in sight. started out with the sausage and pepper app and the clam app. both were well presented and good. small portion of bread was served with olive oil. house salad, beet salad, arugula and fennel salads were all terrific. entrees included the whole fish branzino, the large veal chop, and the risotto short rib were served promptly, hot and all were excellent. wine list is a bit slim. we had an malbec from Argentina which was quite nice. owner came by to say hello and ask about the food. always a nice touch. we would recommend this small family owned and operated rest."}
{"text":"I had a reservation for 5 PM on a Saturday. The restaurant had just opened for the day, so we had the place all to ourselves. For our appetizers, we ordered shrimp (average taste) and pork belly (moist center, crispy outside, bit of fat). For our main courses, we ordered duck (cold temperature) and flat iron (spicy). For desserts, we ordered cheese cake (the only food there that my husband said tasted \"very good\") and peanut butter and fudge creme brulee (sugar on top but very different texture and taste from a typical creme brulee). The waitress was friendly, gave us frequent drink refills, and brought out the food quickly. I liked the food. My husband pushed his food around on his plate, and he went to Burger King afterward to fill up. :/ Dress code is casual."}
{"text":"Best flatbread and pasta appetizer anywhere. Great couples atmosphere. Very romantic. BYOB for $15. Tonight I got the lamb chops and they were AMAZING. My husband got the veal strip steak and couldn't be happier. We prefer to eat here than at Ditkas, capital grill, or Morton's. Sam is the best chef...Lori is so sweet. I've known both of them for quite sometime. Hope Josh is your server  he's awesome and knows the whole menu like the back of his hand! Straight forward AWESOME experience. Will be back many many times."}
{"text":"Quality of food was good. Staff was professional. Dessert was delicious and they had a nice bar menu. Prices were a little high but it is to be expected in Sewickley."}
{"text":"Food and service were exemplary. Excellent ambience, great Porterhouse steak and Shishito peppers, and both the owner and the entire team were very dedicated to curating a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"I recently went to Sewickley to meet some friends on a Saturday evening for Dinner. As we were walking to our cars we heard the sound of a band playing on the patio at Vivo and decided to stop for a couple of drinks. There were plenty of open tables but we could not have been greeted more rudely. A lady who seemed like the owner and a waitress gave us an attitude before even sitting and made us feel as if they did not want us there because we had already eaten dinner. We agreed to order appetizers because that is the only way that they would let us sit and the band sounded good. As we sat at our table we could see others that they made stand towards the back of the patio because they didn't want empty tables to be taken by people only having drinks. It seemed to us that it was highly unlikely that someone was coming in after 9 pm for dinner and the staff was just overall rude to the others as well. Finally we got our overpriced appetizers and I can't even recommend this place for its food. It is average at best and considering we were forced to buy and it was way overpriced for quality. The only good part about the experience was the band rocked!"}
{"text":"We splurged and came here for Mothers' Day.  Unfortunately the service was smug; our server seemed uninterested and didn't smile, even when we tried to make chit-chat.  The food was good, but servings small.  We left hungry.  Also, the place is not kid-friendly.  We were charged $2.50 for a half glass of milk.  I wish there were more dining options in the area - on Sundays much of Sewickley is closed - I wonder how stores stay in business."}
{"text":"I stopped by here last night with my fiance for a belated birthday dinner for myself.  Whenever we got there the place was packed which I thought was surprising for a Wednesday but thankfully I had made reservations.  We arrived right around the time of our reservation and were told that our table wasn't ready yet but should be soon as the table we would be sitting at had just received the bill.  It was at this point that things got a little weird for me as I normally would hang out around the host/hostess station or a seating area to wait for our table but there wasn't an area to sit and the hostess was pointing us to a corner of the bar.  So we were essentially forced to sit at the corner of the bar whenever we didn't really want to.  The kicker was that we were wet because it was raining outside and of course we were under the vent which was pouring out cold air.  After about 15 minutes of waiting at the bar we were finally seated at a table, unfortunately under another vent.  This would lead to my fiance being cold for the rest of the the night and me not being terribly comfortable either.  Thankfully things would get better after this.  Once we were finally seated I was able to get a better look at the restaurant.  It was pretty modern looking with some track lighting and one big pretty light, a bar in the corner and very clean.  Since the restaurant was very full though and it is a very open space the restaurant was very loud and I actually had a hard time hearing my fiance for the first half of dinner.  There also was a nice looking courtyard out in front of the restaurant that we passed on the way in with a number of tables that could not be used that night due to the rain.

We decided to start off our meals by splitting an appetizer which consisted of fresh fig on top of chorizo on top of a cheese with a rhubarb syrup on the plate.  After the odd opening experience of feeling like a second class diner, I did not want to like the food and at first glance was a little disappointed in the size of the appetizer.  However, it proved to be excellent and although small, 1 fig sliced into quarters, I really enjoyed it.  The sweet fig combined with the slightly spicy chorizo and savory cheese was awesome.  For my dinner entree I decided to go with the wagyu flat iron, medium, which came with some type of aioli on it while my fiance went with the lemon salmon.  All of the entrees were to be served with a vegetable and a starch and both of ours came with identical items that seemed to be cauliflower, bak choy(?) and sweet potatoes.  My steak came out with a good helping of aioli poured over it which I would normally be happy about.  However, this steak could have been the star on its own and I thought that the aioli actually detracted from it.  The steak tasted very good with a nice sear on that gave it a nice crust and was still tender even though it seemed to be more of a medium well than a medium.  My fiance was also very happy with her salmon and thought that it tasted good.  While I am normally not much of a dessert person, the rest of the food was good enough that I decided to give it a try.  I went with the salted caramel cheesecake while my fiance went with some decadent chocolate cake which she loved.  My cheesecake was interesting in that it was served in what I would consider a mini jar and then topped with whipped cream, caramel and the salt.  Due to this I was able to control the topping/cake ratio which was nice and I thought my dessert was very good, especially whenever I got a nice piece of salt with the rest.  My only complaint of it would be that there wasn't enough of the salt but that is minor as I wouldn't want my dessert to be too salty.

The bottom line for me is that I am not sure if I would head back here again in the future.  The food was certainly awesome and by itself would deserve 5 stars but I was not a big fan of the atmosphere of the place and it may be the first restaurant that I have been to where I would use the word snobby to describe it."}
{"text":"There were some really good parts about this place and some really bad parts. We went there to celebrate a family birthday dinner on a Saturday night. We got there and were seated right away.  The men ordered beer and the women ordered cocktails. One of the cocktail orders was for a Cosmo and it wound up getting sent back because of how poor it tasted. Extremely way too sour. Switched that drink out for a glass of red wine. The blueberry vodka Moscow Mule drink was almost sent back as well. Not really that great. 

The food turned out to be really good. Not one complaint about the food. I highly recommend the Wagyu flat iron steak for an entree. This was really great and was cooked exactly how I requested it to be. 

I found out after dinner that my Mother in law had called ahead to the restaurant to notify them that the purpose of the dinner there was to celebrate a birthday. There wasn't one mention of it by anyone on the staff. Any place that I've ever gone to for a birthday has acknowledged it with some sort of dessert.  This was highly disappointing and would keep me from coming back for dinner in the future. 

We also didn't care for the ambience, or lack thereof, and we felt like the $180 bill wasn't worth it.  There are much better restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Last evening I had the pleasure of dining at Vivo Kitchen in Sewickley. The aroma of those first Fall evening fires lingered in the air as I walked into this hip spot. 
Great setting, vibrant crowd, elevated but yet simple menu , and efficient wait staff.   All is well but a few suggestions to really make a polished finish at Vivo.

The wine ( red in particular) was too warm. It barely had a chill which made it almost non palatable. Now we all know that many people do not like cold red wine - me either. But we also know, especially if you have travelled down Chiati Road, that a Sicilian red is best served between 57* and 61*. It is much easier too over chill a red and let it warm, than to try and rehabilitate a too warm red by re-re chilling.

The second suggestion is an easy fix. Coffee without cream ? You have to be kidding ? We all respect different diet choices like vegan, paleo, Atkins , etc. 
But really,  how can you offer such superb French press coffee at the end of a tantalizing palate experience  and serve a small creamer filled with 2% milk ? 
Complete mistake. 

Please tell me when these blemishes are cleared up. I can't wait to return for the flatbread with burrata and the heirloom tomatoe salad, followed by a true to form peanut butter fudge creme brûlée."}
{"text":"What an amazing place!  Really nice atmosphere serving great food, great desserts, topped with an amazing staff.   The wait to make it to this place was well worth it.  It s BYOB, but they do have a full bar.  I shall return..."}
{"text":"Our go-to spot for New Year's Eve for the past 4 years!  Sam always crafts an incredible menu start to finish.  Jennifer is a wonderful server and always remembers us.  Don't miss the awesome outdoor dining when the weather plays nice!  The Manhattan is always the right choice on the drink menu."}
{"text":"Best option in Sewickley this far.   The food was delicious and the service was excellent.  There wasn't a disappointing plate served to our large party.  There was enough that we could all share small portions with each other to sample.  The waiter was extremely knowledgable of the wine list and made fantastic, educated suggestions.    I highly recommend."}
{"text":"If I could give this restaurant zero stars, I would. I have been there before and found the food to be mediocre and over priced, but thought we would give it another try. The older disheveled woman, apparently the owner, was very rude to me and my son and his fiancé from the time we all arrived. She was abrupt and completely belittling to them as they had arrived before us, but were enjoying drinks and appetizers, and told them we had to be out by 8 (this was at 6:30) When my husband and I arrived she yelled that we should have been on time and again repeated that we would need to be gone by 8. When I said she was being rude, she again yelled that I was rude and should be there on time. My son and fiancé had already spent $60 on over priced drinks and appetizers! I told her, that her behavior was inappropriate she told me \"up yours\". We left! There are plenty of other better restaurants in Sewickley. Don't go there. After seeing the other reviews below, she has treated other patrons the same way."}
{"text":"A little expensive, but the food is excellent. Great experience there!"}
{"text":"Not only was our food incredible (the pear, pomegranate, goat cheese salad is incredible), the service was friendly and efficient. Always the right amount of professionalism mixed with personality, the icing on the cake (not literally) means you will feel like your are sitting at your BF's house for dinner ... and your BF just finished culinary school. Make a point of trying Vivo's - you will be happy you did."}
{"text":"First visit and easily wins my vote for best restaurant in Pittsburgh...sumptuous ingredient driven menu of local vegetables and even some exotic game meats such as kangaroo. The wine list impresses, we topped our meal off with a 2008 Eagle Eye, Infatuation that burst with flavors surprisingly fair prices...beds of truffles with egg, favas and English peas paired with ricotta salata. The chef pays homage to the purity of local flavors and distinguished preparation, thank you for this meditation on food...."}
{"text":"Awesome little hide away.

One of the best steaks I've had, great drink menu and friendly atmosphere.  

Definitely check it out."}
{"text":"Went for a late lunch/ dinner at Vivo's and loveddddd it!! Butter lettuce was fresh and crispy with just the perfect tang to the dressing... I had halibut and it was perfection..service was excellent and just nice people, atmosphere was perfect... I will go back for sure. It's my number one restaurant in Sewickley... will be returning soon."}
{"text":"I did not plan to leave another review, but the pork chop is so amazing that I can only leave a picture of bones behind. Combined with a corn barely side makes it so, that it's finger licking good."}
{"text":"My go to place in Sewickley! Fabulous food, excellent drinks, and a lovely ambience. The wait staff is overly accommodating, catering to my every demand, of which there are many. The most delicious food I have had in the entire city. The lamb ribs and brussel sprouts make my mouth water just talking about them. Treat yourself to a one of a kind meal and drinks of your dreams. I warn you though you will be hooked and looking forward to your next visit as soon you are walking out the door.This is a restaurant not to be missed."}
{"text":"I had a lovely dining experience with my mom and aunt for her birthday on Thursday. It was a first time to Vivo. I was in a small plate mood and ordered the butter lettuce salad drizzled with truffle oil. IT. WAS. AMAZING. I also had the Brussels sprouts and cheese plate. I was going to order the meatballs but I was totally satisfied with the three small plates. Everything was so delicious. The raspberry mustard on the cheese plate was other worldly. My aunt ordered the kale and beet salad which looked gorgeous. I forget what else they ordered but they both loved everything. Our waiter, Ed,  knew the menu really well and gave us great suggestions.  He also made us laugh. The owners stopped at our table and were really friendly and down you earth.  The one owner makes all the desserts. We had a salted caramel cheesecake and Adobe kind of chocolate gelato. Ed picked our desserts for us because we couldn't decide and his choices did not disappoint. The decor is modern and minimal, but still comfortable and homey.  I look forward to going back! Especially to check out the outdoor patio and live music!"}
{"text":"The food, service, drinks and company were out of this world. My man hates veggies, and he ate them here. He had the ribeye. I had the pork chop. We fought over the flourless cake. We'll be back! Kudos to Sam and the wonderful bar tender. PS; make reservations."}
{"text":"We dined in the restaurant alone as it was close to closing time.  Despite our arrival 20 minutes before closing, they were immensely welcoming, and they assured us that we could take our time and relax.  We did!  The service was extraordinary, and the food was food was fabulous!!!!!  Everything was prepared to perfection, the favors enhanced the essence of each plate, and it was beyond fresh.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Staff was rude place is a dump... food tasted like rancid horse meat...  the seafood in the salad tasted like it was extracted from the Ohio river... the potato soup made me feel like I was eating gruel from An orphanage..."}
{"text":"The food was average at best and bad at worst.  My wife ordered duck breast and it wasn't properly rendered at all.  So fatty.  Also, the portions of proteins were really miniscule.  I had octopus as a starter.  Taste was fine but thinly sliced over greens.  Maybe  1/2 of a small tentacle.  I'd say 2 ounces.  The duck breast was 4 small pieces, maybe half a breast!!  My elk loin was two slices.  Maybe 3 to 4 ounces of proteins on main dishes.  At an average of $30 that's a crime.  The other thing that was strange was he used the same side on both entrees....sliced asparagus and sun chokes in a sauce that was like teriyaki!?!?!  A bit unusual for a place like that."}
{"text":"Our favorite! The owners, Sam and Lori, are amazing and the food is the best around. Needless to say, we have never been disappointed at Vivo. Bonus: Great outdoor patio when weather permits."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant all year around! So much so this was our 4th consecutive New Year's eve dinner. The staff is wonderful, our server Jennifer is a gem, every time she assists us. The food is top notch and Sam and staff create even more amazing dishes year after year, if that is even possible. The golden potato soup had amazing truffles and pork croutons, what a way to start. The risotto ROCKED! I could describes every single dish but I will just sum up the whole dinner as FABULOUS and palate worthy. The place is romantic and cozy and in the warmer weather the patio is a must, choose to sit outside and enjoy the garden if spots are available.  A must try in Sewickley if you haven't already been there.  Happy New Year Sam, Lori, Jennifer and all the staff of Vivo. See you soon."}
{"text":"I haven't written a review for over a year, but the opportunity to be \"first to review\" and the fact that I'm over 10,000 \"views\" prompted me to give it a shot.  We dined here tonight on a whim having recently bought a new house in the area and trying to check out the local restaurants.  We had a reservation for 730 PM.  The restaurant is somewhat hidden in plain sight right on Beaver St. in Sewickley.  As far as I can tell there is no sign and the entrance is not directly on the street.  We arrived, parked and found our way to the venue. I almost entered the wrong door to a dance studio above, but found the entrance on the side.  There was a lovely courtyard with plenty of outdoor seating filled.  We entered a sparse, but inviting room that was pretty much filled.  We were seated promptly near the kitchen.  The bartendre/waitress...Erin was a nice young lady who was pulling \"double duthy admirably\".  The table next to us mentioned they had been there for a while prior, but we ordered our apps' promptly.  This being a new restaurant I was eager to try many things on the menu...the first being a dirty martini.  Annie and I ordered a few appetizers.  The pasta was okay.  It was an al dente' triangle type pasta that was \"toothsome\" with a simple red sauce and some romano ( I think?).  It was served room tempature, which as you read will be a theme.  The pasta was cooked perfectly, but the sauce was somewhat underwhelming.  They brought some bread, which was cold and served it with average quality olive oil.  Annie asked for butter.   We didn't care much for the rye bread and were happy when Erin mentioned that we could try some other types of bread.  Next we sampled the \"seared foie gras\".  This was not the seared foie gras that we are used to.  It was much more like a cold terrine.  Nevertheless it was quite good, but I think they should change the name on the menu.  I also tried the octupus, which was not chewy (plus+) and easily cut with a butter knife.  It was a bit bland but better when I put some lime juice on it.  Next I tried my favorite dish of the night which were locally grown heirloom tomatoes and mozz.  The dish was perfect in that it was exceptional ingredients simply prepared.  I also had the \"bones\", which was their version of bone marrow with some hawaiian (sp?) (I think?) sea salt and vinegar with brushetta.  I didn't care for the dish.  I wanna say a bit \"gamey\".  I think I'm spoiled on my Mom's Veal bones with her Osso Bucco cooked in tomatoes for days.   Annie ordered the \"1/2 chicken\" for $16.  The skin was crispy which was nice and it was cooked well, but it was such a small portion she could hardly find the breast.  Also, we were told the starch and side would be potatoes and asparagus...which we like.  It turned out to be quinoa again served room temperature and a mix of onions, tomatoes and apples.  It was not memorable and we barely touched the sides.  This probably deserves 2.5 stars, but because it just opend we'll give it 3.  We'll try again, but it's not enough to serve interesting food poorly executed for the most part.  We welcome this additon to the area and hope our next visit will be more successful."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in without reservations on a Saturday night and were told the wait would be about 30 minutes. We put our names in and walked over to Lula for drinks and an appetizer. We are SO glad we waited, because boy- was it worth it!!! Our server was very personable and attentive (unfortunately I didn't catch her name, but she had a long ponytail- pretty girl!) I ordered the chicken with fried garlic and my husband chose the duck. I was a bit turned off when my plate came out with a whole Cornish hen but I dug in anyway and WOW- absolutely delicious. The chicken, the fried Garlic and roasted seasonal vegetables in combination were excellent- I enjoyed every bite! My husbands duck was cooked perfectly and the chef gave him extra beets at his request, very nice. The Chef even came out and personally asked us how our meals were- you can't beat that kind of service! We both felt totally satisfied but not stuffed (like at other restaurants) after our meals; good enough to order desert and espresso (all made from scratch in house!). A perfect date night, we will certainly be back!"}
