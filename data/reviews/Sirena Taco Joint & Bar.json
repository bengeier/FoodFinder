{"text":"First time to Sirena and we are definitely going back! Great place with a fantastic Mexi-fusion menu. Avant garde tacos and fantastic appetizers. Amazing rotating tap list with a great craft beer selection. 

Service was fantastic with many staff going out of their way to ensure my whole family had a great experience (even getting my son a wifi connection). Our server Adam was perfect - highly attentive but not obtrusive, very knowledgeable about the menu and Sirena's extensive tequila list. He made sure we were perfectly and expertly taken care of. 

Pittsburgh has always lacked good Mexican restaurants of any style  and we've definitely never had a fusion restaurant like this. I spend lots of time on the west coast where there are many taco fusion restaurants and Sirena would stand out as a great place even on the W. Coast. Great to have this place close to home."}
{"text":"Tacos were very small and pricey for what they were. I enjoy to have a nice craft beer with dinner and they have a bunch...but they charge too much for the beers as well. Good food, good beers, way over priced."}
{"text":"Not a Mexican restaurant- kind of a trendy taco joint with non Mexican combinations.  Pricey at 2 tacos for $10-$12 and no side items.  We ended up ordering a side of chips and salsa but they were $6 instead of free as in most Mexican restaurants- the salsa was excellent but the chips were right out of a bag!  

Overall tasty good but pricey compared to other like restaurants."}
{"text":"Can no believe how slow service is here. Waited at a table for 20 min without even a hello. We are patient people so without complaint we moved ourselves to the bar. After making eye contact and attempting to wave down numerous bartenders we gave up and left"}
{"text":"Ok, I live in Peters, so I want local businesses to succeed, but frankly I want good businesses to succeed regardless of locale.  

Good food, I was short on time and had empanadas.  Very tasty, good balance, well balanced filling and crust, nice sauce, served well, ...  The rest of the menu grabbed my attention as well.  Good beer selection, more than I expected on tap.  

But the food was pricey.  I wanted to try the mole, always in search of good mole, but time and price got in the way. 

I'll be back, let's see if they adjust anything."}
{"text":"I cannot figure out why there are so many negative reviews. People are complaining about it not being authentic Mexican (or Tex Mex). That is not what they are trying to be. They have a couple of Mexican style tacos, but they specialize if fish and seafood tacos. My wife and I only discovered this place about a month ago, about a month after opening, and we've been back three times. We've had the Scottish Salmon, Soft Shell Crab, Roasted Lamb Chili Verde, and the Adobado Beef Brisket. Loved them and am looking forward to trying more of their 19 different tacos. We also love the Appetizers. We've had the Crispy Pork Belly, Albacore Tartare, Scallop Ceviche, and Mussels. Loved them too. If you're looking for traditional Mexican that's fine, but this isn't the place. My wife and I search out new experiences and tastes. This place fits.

Many of the complaints are about the wait times, but I like to unwind after work, not be rushed. Again, this place fits that. We haven't felt ignored or that things were taking too long. We have been served by John, the bartender twice know. Once at a table and once at the bar He is very accommodating, even when he's busy. I find this place relaxing, and we like the atmosphere. The outdoor patio is great when the weather is nice. It's so nice to have a unique option for dining so close to us in Peters. We will go back again soon."}
{"text":"Just had dinner there tonight with wife and child.  We were seated right away.  Our food took over an hour to come. Upon asking the waitress why, she promptly said - \"cook is very busy\" looking around the inside of the place and it was pretty empty.    Once it arrived the food was average quality, salads were decent size, I got a taco and for as much as it cost was an appetizer size.   I left hungry.  Even hostess said tacos are more like appetizers.    Sirena is extremely over priced and if hungry for Mexican go across the street to Chipotle to get your money's worth.    

I will not be back - sorry Peters Twp people that think it is a great place, it is not."}
{"text":"I went here tonight for dinner with my Sister-in-law and her two friends. I was seated with them quickly and the place was steady but not over crowded. Our waiter took my drink order almost immediately which was great. 

We took awhile to order food, but when we did I ordered the beef brisket taco. I see a lot of people say 10 dollars is a lot for 2 tacos and no sides, but the flavor and portion of the tacos were perfect and the brisket was amazing. Definitely worth the 10 dollars to me! No sides were needed as I was stuffed just from the two tacos. The only downfall about our food is it took way longer than it should to bring out two tacos, we waited at least 45 mins and the food was luke warm at best on arrival, but still good enough to eat. 

The ambiance of the place was nice, lots of people socializing and drinking. Great outdoor patio and they had live music. Although tonight was a one man band (he wasn't my favorite) but he didn't kill the vibe either.

When we were ready to go, I payed with a 20 dollar bill for a $14.51 check. I was surprised when the waiter brought back my change, he kept my actual change. The .49 cents and left me a 5 dollar bill. I was upset because the policy that waiters don't carry actual change was not listed anywhere and to pocket my change without prior knowledge is like stealing regardless of the amount. Plus only leaving me a 5 dollar bill didn't leave much of an option on how much To tip him. I luckily had some ones and counted the .49 cents into the change I left for a tip. I personally think that is BAD business practice for a restaurant. If customers are not Notified prior you should not be keeping their change and not providing them with ones to leave a tip amount at their discretion when paying with cash. 

Honestly, I will probably never dine in here again, but would consider ordering to go and definitely paying with a credit card next time."}
{"text":"John at the outside bar is the real deal. Where else can you get a dude that knows how to do underwater welding at a nuke facility and also serve up carne Asada tacos that rule and ice cold brew while Slightly Stoopid jams in the background with the Pirates on the the 2 outside flat screens?"}
{"text":"My friend and enjoy finding new restaurants.  We searched on yelp and found this hidden gem 

First! The location throws you off.  It's in a plaza, and is in the first section on left.  It's decieving.  It's part of the building that you walk in and has several business in it, taco bar is last one in building. 

It's  'please seat yourself '.  We picked a booth.  Our waitress lauren, pronounced louren was awesome.  Sweet, attentive and knowledgeable.  Fyi, thanks lauren.

We order chips salsa.  Salsa was not amazing,  but I'm comparing it to my salsa - and mine salsa is a 15 on scale of 1-10.  

Personal note, this salsa has heat.  If you don't like heat, not for you.

We did tacos.  The bbq ribs taco, oh yeah - was really good.

My friend had lamb taco, she was impressed. 
Her son had kids menu quesadilla and fries, he liked the food.

Lauren comes to booth and said that evil word dessert,  as my friend and I, ours eyes grew big.  We order the lemon berry marscapone cake - omg, let me say again omg yum.

We plan on a return trip."}
{"text":"Visited last night. 3 Taco combo was very good, but as others have mentioned, a bit over priced. Great beer selection and margaritas also very good. It is not supposed to be a Mexican place, but a Specialty Taco joint which it is. Wait staff was very knowledgeable and friendly."}
{"text":"Great variety of freshly made tacos from an assortment of fish to lamb and beef. Nice atmosphere too. Management and staff is extremely nice."}
{"text":"YOU WILL BE MISSED SIRENA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The Mahi tacos with mango salsa are outstanding. My wife who does not normally care for brisket nor grilled pineapple loves the beef brisket taco.  Decent beer selection that I would love to see rotate a bit more. Service has always been good in our 4 trips to this fun little taco joint."}
{"text":"So I feel the need to post my first review on Yelp. Had heard of this place...saw mixed reviews, but decided to be open minded and adventurous. My party of three walked in and was greeted by a slovenly looking hostess with an attitude. Ok, just show me my table. We ordered top shelf margaritas for $11 each, that contained an excessive amount of ice. For my second one, I asked for mercy....I wanted to taste that tequila! It arrived with just as much ice. Not a good start....We ordered the chips & salsa, and enjoyed them very much. Chips were crispy and tasty, the salsa had a smoky, chipotle taste...very good! The guacamole was bland and forgettable though...save your money. I ordered the stuffed poblano pepper tacos for $9. They were delicious, but not a lot of food for the money. They did not come with ANY sides..I had to pay $3 for a side salad that was not exciting. My husband got the paella for $23...shrimp, mussels with rice and he seemed to enjoy it, though it certainly was not of Mallorca Restaraunt's standard. Our friend got the taco salad. She had no complaints..it looked appetizing and fresh, though at $14, it was pricey. So we enjoyed the meal, our server was very nice, though not super attentive, even though on a Saturday night, they were not particularly busy, but he did get the manager/owner to knock off $2 each for 4 of the margaritas. The manager/owner was not very friendly, and also had an attitude when we complimented her on the food, but expressed dismay over the high prices. Our bill, minus the $8 off for the over-iced drinks, was $102.....pretty expensive for a taco joint. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"I really wanted this place to be great.  The menu and the atmosphere make you think it will be, but in the end it's just a basic taco joint with decent food."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh needs more good Mexican food. While Sirena isn't as good as what you might get down South, I was pleasantly surprised by how tasty everything was., particularly their homemade salsa. The location is kind of weird but it's a family place so it doesn't really matter. They have an awesome outside patio/deck, perfect for the summer. The service was good and food was about as good as you can find for Mexican in Pittsburgh. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I really liked it here. Had the chips and salsa for an app. Then, I had the beef brisket tacos which had a great flavor. My husband had the combo w/ the tilapia taco, BBQ shimp taco and the salmon taco. He liked all of them with the salmon being his favorite. Oh, and he also got the jalapeno cornbread which came with a key lime butter ---- which was amazing!!! Also had a few cocktails, the blueberry mojito was nice and refreshing. The atmosphere was fun and summery. They said next weekend they're having an official grand opening with live music and drink specials, so I'll bet that would be a good time."}
{"text":"Taco variety is great. Had the Oyster Shitake Mushroom yesterday.  My favorite of all. 
Service was excellent. 
Only complaint/recommendation: Please invest in some normal size bar stools and high top stools.  Unless you are a size 0-2 you will be barely fit on the stool comfortably.  They are cold metal and extremely small."}
{"text":"Worst service i have ever received manager was horrible will never go back and i strongly suggest you dont either this owner keeps changing  her business over and over and she is NEVER there she needs to give it up and move on what a terrible place"}
{"text":"Like many others, I wanted to like this place. My margarita was terrible. The place was less than half full at 7:00 on a beautiful Saturday night, and yet  our food was delivered cold. Of course, the manager asked if he could have the kitchen remake it, but at that point, it wasn't worth the wait. The table next to us was also told that they would have to wait for silverware because they didn't have any clean. Again... Less than half full. This place has potential if they get the right people in the kitchen and behind the bar."}
{"text":"We went as a friend gathering. .. very slow service and the bills were completely messed up. They even brought an extra martini. No outdoor music on a friday . Reason for the three star is because the tacos were really good. Authentic.  Small portions. Will I be back.... to see my friends sure but def wouldn't recommend to others bc service always goes a long way."}
{"text":"Amazing high end bistro quality food with a great drink and beer selection.
This place isn't easy to find. It's in Donaldson Crossroads but behind the Kid Gym in the courtyard. 
The tacos were amazing.  We also had their salsa which had a slightly smoky essence and was awesome. Also, the pork belly appetizer was to die for. 
The jerk chicken and mushroom tacos were e best of the four we had. The fried cod was ok as were the carnitas. Great blend of favors. Love he ambience and thy its kid friendly. 
The waiter was very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu!"}
{"text":"A more diverse collection of spirits and flavors than anything in Washington County.   Not always consistent in delivery but the effort is there to create flavors.  I love the support of Wigle whiskey and great craft beers."}
{"text":"The food is great! I love that they are bringing interest to the south hills... Reminds me of a taco place in south side that I loved that is no longer open. I got the poblano tacos and loved them. Friends got the chix enchilada and lamb and they said they were great. The kitchen was a little delayed and forgot a side but were super nice and took care of it ASAP. - makes sense to me when you are just opening. My recommendation; be open minded and try it out!! It's not standard Mexican which is why it is so fun!! Enjoy!

Oh- and get the chipotle sweet potato mash!! So good! :)"}
{"text":"The good thing was the waiter was super nice and attentive. Chips were greasy. They were out of the soup and the main course I wanted on a Saturday night, at dinner time???
So I ended up with chicken tortilla soup, it was barely warm, and the flavor was so so. 
I also had the brisket taco, which had great flavor but...barely warm, more on the cold side. The rice and beans were just plan cold. Food should come out hot, which makes me question how long it was sitting. 
The worst part was My husband had the salmon taco, and as we were leaving he felt sick to his stomach. Not a good experience for him, nor me!!!
The only reason for one star was for our waiter."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! We loved the love music & patio. The catfish tacos were great--just the right amount of heat--and 2 tacos is a perfect portion size.

We were pretty disappointed in the very slow service. The outdoor bar is great, but it just didn't make sense to only keep a few specialty drinks there and have the bartender run inside every time someone ordered a beer."}
{"text":"As of a month or so ago, the Tuesday Coronas jumped to $3 from $2, but the place still rates 5 stars in my book."}
{"text":"Not a bad little place, but they could use some direction with their flavors...and I'm not talking authenticity here, as that's out the window when you include Korean bulgogi on your taco menu. It's simply that some things I ate here were good, and some needed help. The chicken mole taco had some good flavors, and I would order this one again. I didn't get a big hit of mole flavor, which is what I was looking for, but it was still a good taco. The pork bulgogi taco was not good, and I would like to see them tweak this one. I like heat and that wonderful unctuous quality that comes with good bulgogi...a combo of the grilled flavor with the tender and fatty meat with the rich marinade flavors. I got none of that with this pork, and was disappointed with the whole thing, especially the weird grated cheese on top. Yuck. I'm also a fan of simple guacamole, and their's is anything but, with too many ingredients that confuse the palate. Overall, not great, but I'm willing to try some more items from the menu, and hope the chicken mole taco was not an anomaly. Your tacos will automatically come on flour tortillas, which I detest, as they taste like cardboard...I was happy that they at least offer corn tortillas, even if they're out of a plastic bag."}
{"text":"We have been to Sirena Taco twice.  The first time we went we loved it and couldn't wait to go back.  The only negative for that trip was the prices.  The tacos were delicious but for the price should come with at least one side. 
 Also, to have to pay extra for Chips and Salsa is discouraging, I've been to many Mexican restaurants and I can't think of another that doesn't include chips with your meal!  
    On our second visit, it was Saturday night and the place was hopping!  We got seated at a table near the bar which wouldn't have been a problem except the table was so small that when our food came we had to move the plates diagonally to get them to fit and then juggle to get our drinks up without spilling them since it was so crowded. 
   As far as the food went it was good but as mentioned earlier the prices are high.  The guacamole was delicious!  I ordered a tequila infused pineapple Margarita which really just tasted like a bland slushy so that was disappointing.  
   We'll probably give it another try, but I doupt it will go in our regular rotation.  Too bad cause I really hope they can be successful."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Our bartender, Greta, was out of this world. She was calm and in control all night. I visited this establishment on Cinco de Mayo and even though the bar and restaurant was full, she delivered timely and efficient service with a great attitude and a smile over and over again. Would highly recommend this taco joint on the service alone."}
{"text":"underwhelming and extremely overpriced. i know it's in peters but i've got a car and so does everyone else who lives here. we can go someplace else and the owner might want to pay a bit of attention. this restaurant has a great space but you might never find it.  no signage from 19 makes it more than difficult to locate. 1/2 price crafts on monday is great but necessary to make up for the (very) overpriced and (moderately) underseasoned food. $10-12 for 2 small tacos?  literally nothing is included - no chips, no rice, nothing. good beer selection and a friendly bartender helped, but you can't even make your own combo!  when i mentioned this to the server she said - yeah i know. everyone wants that but our kitchen won't listen.  well, i can get better food for HALF the price at a half dozen other taco joints. soooooo i guess i'll just do that."}
{"text":"Brought my kiddos here for a quick lunch, we were served immediately and service was wonderful. Loved the decor, my kids were fascinated and scared about the puffer fish light fixture above our table (yes it was real..ha).
We had just regular beef tacos, and they were just okay, nothing spectacular, meat even seemed dry. Asked for side of salsa to help it along. Wasn't impressed with their salsa, which a side of salsa costed us $3.00 for..hmm.. In my opinion seemed very overpriced for what it was. 
 Service was excellent and I liked the decor, but probably would not be frequenting again any time soon."}
{"text":"Definitely a good idea.. But not executed well. Food is mediocre and service is awful. The queso was chunky and kind of chalky? Was not a fan at all. Our waitress was friendly, but very slow and inattentive. My water sat empty for what felt like a lifetime. Our food took forever, and so did our check. Like I said, great idea.. Perfect atmosphere. Should probably work on the important stuff though."}
{"text":"The food here is decent but I have had better tacos at other restaurants. This restaurant is about 30 or so minutes from my house so it's not good enough for me to make the drive to eat there. Had the Mexican street corn, it was ok kinda bland. Ate the mahi taco & mac n cheese taco without bacon. Both tacos were good. I liked the mac n cheese taco better, it is a more original type taco. This place is worth trying but only if you're in the area. Not worth making a long drive to eat at."}
{"text":"Delicious & Different...and VERY filling! Had a slight \"hiccup\" tonight as no one greeted us or seen that we had sat down...but they fixed that quickly by giving us a complimentary appetizer (which didn't help me eating my dinner lol!) I get the Blue Planet combo and will be taking 2 of the 3 tacos and most of the rice home with me!!! 
Hopefully we'll be able to sit on the deck before it gets too chilly in the evenings!"}
{"text":"Possibly my new favorite place in Peters.  The barbecue shrimp tacos were fantastic.  If you want regular Mexican tacos, this ain't it.  If you like different food than your typical Pittsburgh experience, with really good drinks, you will enjoy this place.  We got 2 sets of tacos, 2 large kids meals, a crazy delicious flavored Margarita, and a creative dessert for $50.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Tucked inside Donaldson's Crossroads Court. Our maiden voyage was last evening. A good variety of tacos and craft beers. We enjoyed chips and salsa and 4 different tacos. Service was slow due to the crowd and very loud. I vote yes but the Mrs. abstained. And a bit pricey. Worth checking out."}
{"text":"Went over lunch. Read the reviews ahead of time and expected we might get mediocre service - but service was great! Either we got the one good server or they read their reviews and corrected the issue. 

We each got two tacos, which was the perfect amount for lunch. They also came with a little bowl of rice, beans, and salsa; I wasn't expecting this, so either I missed that a taco comes with this side or they included it to be nice. I got the pork carnitas taco and the chicken enchilada taco. I highly recommend the carnitas. Great flavor and the meat was nice and tender. The chicken enchilada was pretty good, too. Fritos on a taco is brilliant. 

Nice outdoor seating area. We enjoyed the nice weather and sat out there. The surface of the tables and chairs get a little warm from being in the sun, but that's fine! 

I think we found a new lunch spot to add into the rotation!!!"}
{"text":"We are local to the area and had wanted to try this place for a while.  Tonight we decided to give it a try and we were very disappointed.  The service was slow, the waitress unfamiliar with the menu,  and the food really wasn't very good.  

My wife ordered a Barbecued Shrimp Taco that tasted \"fishy.\"  The rest of what we ordered isn't worth mentioning as we really didn't like any of it and we didn't bother taking it home.
We ordered the Mac and Cheese as a side and it was very bland tasting.   Worse yet, it arrived lukewarm. 


For a Friday night, there wasn't much of a crowd, even though there is a nice outdoor seating area and live entertainment.

For what we ordered, the bill was rather pricey for the quality of the food we received.   I'm not sorry to say that we won't be going back."}
{"text":"We ate here on their first day of business.  I was disappointed as I was not able to order all the items I wanted (combos weren't available but the individual items were; we couldn't order the churros for dessert either).  The menu items did not list all the ingredients in them; this omission was rather disappointing and colored the impression I had of the ambiance.

The bbq shrimp tacos were pleasant enough though they could have been hotter.  I received two tacos with ample shrimp in each.  The bbq sauce was not overpowering.  No side dish came with the entrée.  For $12 and only two tacos, the price seemed a bit steep. 

The black bean salsa that was ordered was very good and the portion size was more than ample.  The accompanying chips, too, were good."}
{"text":"This place is a disaster. I have never seen more indifferent service. I watched two women who came in after me get fed up and leave. Then, after it took 20 minutes to get a beer and I was listening to my server tell everyone at all the other tables how lucky they were to be leaving now because the kitchen is way understaffed, I got up and left also. Do NOT go to this place if you expect to be served food. There's about a 1 in 5 chance of that happening."}
{"text":"I love the concept - this type of place doesn't really exist in the City.  

The menu aspirations didn't come through in reality. 

I had the Mexican street corn to start. This would probably be a lot better when corn is actually in season. The flavor was ok but the corn was mushy - like it was frozen. 

The tacos (pork belly, fish and carne asada) were good as was the margarita.   

The bad part was the service - it was just terrible. We sat at the bar and were totally ignored for most of the night. Empty plates stacked up, drink glasses were emptied and our \"server\" just pretended we didn't exist.  The table behind us was full of stacks of dirty plates and glasses the entire time we were there.  The server literally tossed the bill at us as he breezed by )after I asked for the bill)

The atmosphere is good and they have what looks like a nice patio which should rock in the Summer.  

Unfortunately I won't be back to check it out."}
{"text":"We like this place a lot. The food is good, just a little inconsistent, as in I order the same thing, I like it each time but it's always made differently. Good drafts and nice outdoor area."}
{"text":"Mostly a waste of time. You'd be less frustrated if you just made eccentric tacos at home on your own and winged it. Because even if you failed you wouldn't be waiting for 45 minutes wondering where Tf your four tacos were. Once they got to our table, they were ok, but it wasn't Moses parting the Red Sea to justify the wait time and chewy nacho chips to go with the blah guacamole. Service was nice, but amateur hour. Over price and overrated at 3.5 stars. Stay home and wing it. Your patience thanks me."}
{"text":"Great service, food and atmosphere. Look forward to going back soon. Not sure why some of the negative reviews were given, but it seems that some of the service kinks have been worked out!"}
{"text":"This review has nothing to do with the atmosphere... It is perfect! However the service definitely is fair or below, the food,although fresh, is way too pricey and somewhat tasteless. I was looking forward to the guacamole and it tasted just like smashed avocado. Chipotle has far better guacamole. I will probably give it another chance because I only had bottled beer and appetizers. I would like to try the margaritas and perhaps a meal."}
{"text":"I am surprised at how many bad reviews there were on this restaurant.  Sirena had a great atmosphere and the food, in my opinion was delicious.  I went after work on a weekday, so it was not that busy, however the service was great.  I ate at the bar and the two bartenders were friendly, knowledgeable and good at their job! 

I ordered a regular margarita on the rocks, shared guacamole with the people i was with and also got a taco combo with chicken, steak and fish.  The margarita was good, it did not taste like the store bought mixes you get sometimes when at restaurants.  The guacamole had a great taste, I usually prefer a chunky guacamole and this was not that, but the taste and spice made up for it.  I loved my tacos.  I am not a huge steak eater and even the steak tacos were great (maybe a little too much rice in that one though).  All in all my food was very good and the service was also great.  

My one complaint is that even though I am from the area I didn't really know how to get in.  If you aren't familiar with the strip mall's hall way, which they are located, it can be a little confusing.  However my confusion worked out for me because I ended up parking close by the back door entrance.  

I am looking forward to trying it out while there is live music or maybe their \"Taco Tuesday.\"  I think this is a great addition to the area and when you really think about restaurants near by that could compare, you would not rank Sirena negatively!  I hope it continues to do well."}
{"text":"Not impressed. The homemade salsa was good but the tacos were overpriced and I didn't really like it. We were there on a Saturday afternoon and they were out of several things.
Kind of a weird location, we actually had a hard time finding it.
Great concept but poorly executed."}
{"text":"Takeout order tonight for taco Tuesday- nothing elaborate- just the chicken and beef tacos they had on special. Was told 25 min wait and it ended up being 50 mins!  For a few tacos!  Tacos were pretty good. Not blown away but better than surrounding area options."}
{"text":"We REALLY had high hope for this place, but after 3 separate visits, hopes have been dashed. The food, service and dining experience has declined dramatically since our first visit. The latest time in  we experienced an untrained, disinterested staff, cold And EXPENSIVE food ($9 for a 1/4 cup of guac, $ 12 for 2 so so taoo's) and yes a $6.00 12 oz draft beer. Heck a 20 ounce draft at Steelers game is only a couple bucks more. I don't know where the owner thinks she is but NYC beer and food prices will not fly in Wash County, Peters Township or not.  I'll stick with El Camp down the road..."}
{"text":"Sorry but, no.  So many things wrong with this place.  I really wanted to like it.  Cool place with an outside dining/drinking area.  Our waitress knew very little about the menu items, service was slow, absolutely no pre-bussing, $9 for a very small bowl of average guacamole.  I ordered two tacos and could not finish either one of them.  Margarita was average.  $85 for two adults and 2 young kids.  I'm not cheap but that's crazy!"}
{"text":"I ordered guacamole, pork bulgogi tacos, and chicken mole tacos to share. The guacamole was ok. I don't want as much added in as they do here. They're trying to hard with their food. The chips were too salty and it wasn't good sea salt compounding the problem. The pork tacos were a miss. Funky. I like Korean a lot and even if this was supposed to be a fusion it wasn't good. The addition of cheese pointed to a lack of understanding of what goes and where to stop. The chicken mole taco doesn't really taste like its a mole but it was pretty good and better than the pork.  

The service was very good. I didn't love the decor and ambiance inside at all but the patio is nice enough. It's expensive too. I would try some more and am giving a generous 3 stars because they're new."}
{"text":"The corn appetizer is all I could think about after leaving Sirenas! Hopefully they come up with a few more veggie tacos but I do love the atmosphere, the service and the food. After going there for dinner once, huz and I loved the openness of it so much that we threw his birthday party there. They handled a group of 25 adults and 4 toddlers effortlessly! We had the entire back to ourselves, they cut the cake we brought into small pieces and served all of us and the service did not miss a single beat. Love it here!"}
{"text":"Overpriced, underwhelmed. Despite the warning reviews, we tried Sirena because of a Living Social deal, and we should have heeded the warnings. $6 for so-so chips and salsa? What? Despite telling our server multiple times we wanted our mac n' cheese  taco WITHOUT MEAT, it came with pork. It was noticed by our server, but it was supposedly the kitchens fault. We came home with stomachaches and headaches that night. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Not satisfied in any way. Per a review I posted on a related site:
\"Same experience as many, many other reviewers: Incompetent, indifferent service and over-priced food. Two average tacos with no sides for $12? No thank you. A small, unremarkable portion of Guacamole for $9? Who are you kidding? Our waitress was under-trained. She clearly conveyed a lack of enthusiasm for her work and the dining experience. Witnessed another waitress sit with (presumably) acquaintances at an adjacent table for at least 20 min. Really? Beverage order was incorrect. Meal service was exceptionally slow when the restaurant was not busy. The indifference exhibited and excessive prices are enough to never return. Hopefully the restaurant that will inevitably replace it is more successful at service, execution and market price.\""}
{"text":"The guacamole and chips are super fresh and full of flavor!  The tacos are to die for.  The flavors are not your typical Pittsburgh Mexican, they use global spices and flavors to enhance the meats/veggies.  Definitely a great place, service was outstanding."}
{"text":"What a great find!  This little place is tucked in the back of Donaldson's Crossroads beyond the Little Gym, etc, and is an example of well-executed fusion food.  The prices seem a little spendy ($10 for two tacos at lunch) until you get the plate--the portions are huge and you get rice and beans on the side, so lots of food for the price.
We enjoyed the chicken tortilla soup - very good with roasted corn in it and avocado on top.  I had the battered cod tacos and my honey had the carnitas.  Mine came with a good slaw on top, salsa with fresh jalepenos and a nice touch of arugula inside.  The carnitas were very good, and he loved the bacon jelly that came with it.  
The menu was quite intriguing and I love the mashup of cuisines presented:  Paella (Spanish) with Mexican chorizo and pico de gallo, chipotle soup (Mexican) with garam masala (Indian), corn chowder with kimchi, etc.  The flavors were very good and we'll definitely be back to try out more--there were enough things that made me curious and the food was good the first time."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch. Good atmosphere and the service was great. Food was full of flavor. i had the BBQ Shrimp tacos and Chipotle Sweet Potato mashed.  My wife had the Pork Carnitas and Mac & Cheese.  Both dishes were filling and delicious."}
{"text":"Nice little spot!! Hopping! Nice outdoor area. Worth keeping your eyes open for!!  At the back of the little mall in Donaldson Crossroads Plaza above Citizens Bank. Actually been here several times. Menu always evolving!!  Nice surprise every time. Also an interesting beer selection!!!"}
{"text":"We had a good meal.  Our waitress was funny and gave us good service.  
The tacos are an assortment of different flavors and not your normal taco.  Tried a BBQ Shrimp taco with chipotle and some avocado cream that was OK, the avocado cream was almost none existent. Also, had a Roasted Lamb Chili Verde that had a lot of flavor and received a fork full of the Salmon that was pretty good.  The tacos were on a flour tortillas which I was not expecting.  Would have definitely preferred it to be on a corn tortilla.

The outdoor space was a nice place to sit and enjoy our dinner."}
{"text":"It's not Mexican, but it is a taco bar. The menu isn't large, but it is somewhat diverse. I had the Pittsburgh tacos and my buddy had the pork tacos. We shared a guac, salsa, and chips app and everything was very tasty. They have a nice selection of beer and there's an outside tiki bar that will be open when the weather turns. The bartender indicated that Tuesday evening specials are $2 tacos and $2 Corona/CL, so that sounds right up my alley. Great place, can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This is a hard one to review. Went their last Saturday. Told we had to wait 20 minutes because the kitchen was running behind. Okay. Had a drink at the bar (had to hit the bartender over the head to get waited on, and he wasn't busy). After waiting about 30 minutes (to sit outside) we were greeted by our less-than-observant waitress. Ordered more drinks which she promptly got wrong. Ordered the crusty pork belly which they tried to give to someone else (this place isn't that big to screw up where the food goes). Wanted guacamole with our chips. Told they didn't have any avocados (they're out of season right now?). Interesting because one of the tacos ordered is supposed to come with slices of avocado (it didn't). Waited almost 45 minutes from the time we ordered until our food came, which they tried to give to another table again.  Some people at the table of 8 next to us never got their food. Some of our tacos were cold when we finally got them. When the manager came by we complained about the wait, the cold food and poor service. She said everything is made fresh to order. Fine but that doesn't explain it being cold. She never offered an apology or make up for it in any way. All together we were there for 2 1\2 hours. Food that was hot was good. Service was awful. All of us said unless they clean up their act they won't last long. Too many other choices in the area to languish through this mess."}
{"text":"Relaxed bar atmosphere with good drink and beer selection. Excellent salsa and chips. Would like a little more kick out of the guacamole but still tasty. Wonderful taco selection. Tasted fresh with good flavors."}
{"text":"Definitely was not impressed by Sirena.. My team and I ordered from here for lunch and were pretty disappointed. I had the taco salad. The meat was pretty dry, and the dressing was not good. However the guacamole wasn't bad, and they used nice greens for the salad. Just an FYI.. It is about 10-15 for two tacos."}
{"text":"Took a few extra minutes to find Sirena Taco Joint tucked away in the Donaldson Crossroads Strip Mall.  It is located inside an area where \"the little gym\" is located. The name Taco Joint is a misnomer. This restaurant uses cloth napkins, quality flatware and, the beer is served in  custom glasses.  Though not fancy in decor, this is a nice place.  Sirena Taco Joint offers indoor and patio dining.  The tables are not close together and on my visit we dined on the patio. The  wait service was informative and attentive.

We enjoyed the salsa and chips.  The salsa has a nice heat, not mild, but not overpowering.  Our waitress offered a side of another hot sauce to kick up the heat.
The chips were home made and good.

My husband enjoyed the chicken tortilla soup.  He said it was excellent and large pieces of chicken were visible.  The bowl is small for the price of $7.

We enjoyed the Cod Tacos that were a perfect balance of sweet corn salsa, onion and cilantro.  The Pittsburgh Tacos were full of chunks of beef with lightly dressed cole slaw.  There are spiced fries on top of the beef as well.  The portions were just right in size.

The beer selection is abundant, and the craft selection offers much to choose from."}
