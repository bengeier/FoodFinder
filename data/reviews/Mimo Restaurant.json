{"text":"If you want to wait forever for your food to come visit this place! My husband and I arrived at around 7:40pm  and our food came to us more than 2 hours after ordering our food. The bread was cold, the pop are really expensive $3+ without any free refills and they will serve it in a tiny slim glass loaded with ice.
When it comes to the food it was okay but after the long wait you would really lose your appetite. 
It is not worth coming back to and will never recommend this restaurant to my family and friends. There are a lot of restaurants in Calgary that has great food and great fast service."}
{"text":"We were there last night with my friend, because we wanted to eat paella and it was really good choice! Paella was delicious with fresh sea food. I also tryed Portuguese wine and my bf their traditional beer and is was good too. Servise was perfect and I can this place recommend to all ppl!"}
{"text":"A very nice and quite place with good music. I enjoyed the quality and the taste of the food. The staff were polite and helpful and gave us a lot of information about the culture and the food.
I will definitely go back there again."}
{"text":"Amazing, I loved every bite. 
Generous quantities, You will definitely leave full with some food to take home. 
Will be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here.  The ambiance was great, it was quiet and no one in at lunch.  The seafood was fresh and delicious but a little salty.  My son had the wings which were equally delicious.     I would come back again to share this hidden gem with others in my familia."}
{"text":"Overall, food was good. The paella was excellent and so were the soups (seafood and kale), fish and squid dish. However, the service was tremendously lacking. The waitress was rude, sarcastic and had no people skills. 

As an example, a party of 7 (while we were eating) waited by the front for around 10-15 minutes, although only 3 of the 20 tables were full. They said they had a reservation, but she said she didn't see anything and accused them of having booked it \"only seconds ago\". Who cares?! It's business. 

Next, at our table, she was passive aggressive when we asked what kind about the different kinds of seafood on the menu. She also stood very far away from our table when we asked her questions. She also sounded offended if I asked the soup had any cream in it. At one point, I felt like I needed to stand up for my sister in law, who she spoke fairly rudely to when asking about how spicy certain food was. 

Honestly, if it weren't for the service, I would've given this place a better review. This is not how I want a dinner with family to go."}
{"text":"Without a doubt one of the worst meals I've had in Calgary. The place is just terrible. Beef dish tasted funky. Out of 4 different dishes only one was passable."}
{"text":"When ordering, remember to ask what seafood is in season. I learned from the owner's daughter that mussels are in season until January. Seriously, these were the BEST mussels I've ever eaten. Massive, plump fresh morsels. The pork and mussel casserole was heavenly - the spices and flavour really popped - the pork was tender and the potatoes were full of fried goodness."}
{"text":"Wow what a place! Hidden gem. As soon as you walk in you are greeted with super friendly approach, service was beyond expectation. They were top of everything. We were a group of 11 and they took care of each of us. Its a family owned place so you will feel that love in the restaurant and in the service you will be getting. 

We loved their decor. It has that authentic feel because of their background, ambiance and music. 

Food was really good. Specially Paella was the queen of the table. It had flavor, perfect amount, they did not cheap out on their seafood. It was perfectly cooked and had  every piece of seafood for everyone on our table. 

They close at 9 but because we were big group and was not done on time to finish our food. They did not rush or complain a bit even after 9:30 pm. We highly recommend this place for group gathering, date night."}
{"text":"A Family owned and run business, I have been eating here since the early 90's and it is my favorite Portuguese restaurant this part of the country. Mimo specializes in traditional dishes, great recipes, I love all their seafood dishes, the squid is my #1, and the rest are #2,...the portions, the flavors, simply the best! Peri Peri Prawns a must try, give this place a try,,especially if you like spice. It hits the right spot for me, everytime time!"}
{"text":"Trully tipical Portuguese!!!
Nice experience, nice people, ok food.
It really has the taste of Portugal.
My only negative comment is that the quality of the food is not 5 stars, definitely not bad but let's just say they could have used arroz bomba for the paella and not the regular rice.
The meat is a bit chewy but still good Portuguese flavor."}
{"text":"I've been going to Mimo restaurant for longer than I can remember and it has got to be my go-to favourite place in Calgary for lunch (dinner too I'm sure, I've just never happened to be there in the evening). 

Everyone who works there is just so incredibly friendly and go above and beyond to make the meal one of the best you've had. Some things take a bit of extra time to prepare (its worth it, I promise!) Besides that, I would highly recommend this place to  anyone."}
{"text":"i was looking forward to trying mimo's based on the reviews i've been reading on urban spoon and the ffwd.  being both a seafood lover and a foodie, i was quite excited to get some portuguese grub on.

the waitress was friendly and made a few recommendations on wine and food.  we ordered a bottle of the house red which was pretty good value, i think it was $25 (can't remember exactly) and was very good.

we had heard about the chorico a bombeiro (flaming sausage), which comes out lit on fire. reviews were singing praises for this dish, but i found that after the flames subside, the sausage is actually a bit tough and is a bit too salted for my taste.  

the mains were next, which we went with the bachalhau cosido c/todos (poached cod portuguese style).  the first bite reminded me that we're in calgary and that the cod was frozen.  it was alright (for frozen) but similar to the sausage, a bit salty for my taste.  don't get me wrong, i'm not one for bland food - but it seemed like i couldn't taste the actual fish and was primarily the seasoning or perhaps the brine.  not sure.

we also ordered the paella for one (which included clams, mussels, squid, crab legs, lobster tails, shrimp, chicken, meat and peppers).  it was certainly enough for the two of us, so portion was very healthy and generous.  it was a bit overcooked as all the seafood was a bit tough and the vegetables without a fresh crispiness.  it seemed like the meat was already cooked separately and was added to the paella.  finally, i found the rice to be a bit soggy, perhaps from possibly using cooked rice rather than using stock to cook the rice.

the charming friendliness of the waitress and her stories of portugal made our meal pleasant, but i've had better portuguese food (albeit not in calgary)."}
{"text":"Not many restaurants in Calgary feature many seafood items on their menu, which makes Mimo Restaurant unique in that regard.   My favorite dish is the grilled squid in delicious red sauce.  When it comes out, it doesn't look like much, literally squid in tomato sauce.  But when you taste it, it blows your mind.  They serve it with a big basket of bread so you can soak up all that saucy goodness and by the end you still want to lick the plate clean.  Be prepared to fill up on bread should you order any of the appetizers as most are sauce base and you won't be able to resist yourself dipping the fresh bread into it.  So I advise doing family style.  We were a party of 3 and ordered the Portuguese style mussels, grilled squid in red sauce and paella for 2.  We were unable to finish the paella for 2 due to all the bread we ate, but we didn't mind taking home the left overs.  Another thing I really like about Mimo Restaurant is that they're a family run business, so its great to support them because you can tell they work really hard to do what they can to provide the best experience to their patrons they can."}
{"text":"I went with a group of 4 and reserved ahead for their seafood paella. I actually left a note in open table and they called me back the day of to confirm our reservation and the paella. She said in the future if you want to be sure to have the paella, make a note of the size of the paella and the spiciness you want in the open table reservation. Great info!

We went on a Saturday evening and the restaurant, while big, was not very busy. That being said, service was a little slow (only 2 servers, but took a while to get our bill). 

Food was decent; we only had the paella and the desserts. The paella is a very good portion. Lots of rice, plenty of seafood (a lobster tail each, crab legs, prawns, octopus, beef and chicken) and good flavor. I am just a little sad they didn't let the rice crisp up on the bottom, like Spanish paella... None the less, pretty darn tasty! 

Desserts were only okay; we had the creme caramel and the Portugese egg tart. The creme caramel was a  bit curdled, but still tasty. The Portuguese tart had a good creamy filling, but the shell was a bit tough and chewy (not super fresh, but that's okay). 

Overall good dinner and good value. A paella for 4 cost us about 90$ (before tax and tip) and it was loaded with seafood."}
