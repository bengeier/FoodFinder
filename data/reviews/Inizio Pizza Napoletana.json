{"text":"Tried while visit NC because high reviews. Recommend it if you looking for a light and tasty pizza. Very fresh and flavorful"}
{"text":"I had lunch at Inizio Pizza today for the first and last time.  I went with a friend and she ordered a pizza, I have a lot of food allergies, so I stuck with a salad.  I ordered the Italian Chopped salad, but due to food sensitivities I asked that several items be left off.  I also asked if I could get prosciutto instead of the salami, since I was unsure what the salami was made with.  I would have paid extra.  The check out girl was very nice and seemed unsure how to ring it up, so she asked a manager for help.  He came over and helped her and very rudely told me that they could do it, but if I came again and they were busy, they wouldn't due any modifications.  Are you kidding me?!  It was a salad, I wasn't asking for an entree to be made a certain way.  I am a huge foodie and dine at a lot of restaurants all over Charlotte and have never been told something like that.  The pizza looked great and would have eaten there again with the family, but unfortunately I will never go back and I will let everyone I know, especially if they have food allergies, to stay away!  Horrible customer service!"}
{"text":"I have been telling everyone I know about this place. My parents went with friends to try it out and it is now going to be our go to Pizza place!!! The best pizza I have had in charlotte! The ingedients are fresh and many or all of their ingredients from straight from Italy!  The service is fast and the food does not disappoint! We have have the straight cheese pizza and the last time we tried pepperoni.  WOW! The pepperoni was sliced paper thin and not overly greasy.  The cannoli's are freshly made when you order it, not sitting in a fridge all day.  You have also got to try the gelato! Overall, the food is just amazing.  The service is fantastic as well! All of the workers are friendly and leave you satisfied with a great restaurant experience. You HAVE to try the place, even if you live a bit away. It will be worth it, trust me!!"}
{"text":"I had several problems with the place:  PRICE- 2 pizzas and one 16 oz Coke was $50 and when I paid with credit card, the girl turned the Ipad machine to me and asked if I wanted to add a tip. Unless you are cutting my food and stuffing it in my mouth, I am not going to give you a tip for walking a pizza 10 feet away to me at the table.  MENU: won't do toppings on only half the pizza, two meat topping limit even though they offer 4 kinds of meat toppings.  THE PIZZA: This pizza was a disgrace. The meat pizza was a soggy mess that left an pile of oil and grease on the paper plate (see my uploaded photos). The regular cheese pizza didn't have enough cheese on it. It only covered 15% of the pie, the rest was all sauce showing.   THE STAFF: We were asked on 3 separate occasions if we wanted more sauce to dip our crust in. How about this- why don't you figure out how to put together a pizza that has the correct ratio of dough to sauce to cheese!  Definitely not going back and definitely not recommending.  ADT'L NOTES AFTER JENNIFER OF INIZIO COMMENTED ON MY REVIEW: I appreciate Jennifer of Inizio correcting me on my size of Coke ordered, but that additional 4 ounces of soda still doesn't justify the $50 price tag. There are currently 12,500 Domino's Pizza stores. if no one liked their pizza, there simply wouldn't be that many stores open. I have visited Italy and have eaten pizza in Rome, Venice, Naples, Sorrento, and the Island of Capri and Inizio's pizza didn't taste like anything I ate in Italy. The taste of their pizza was pretty bland and very soggy. I stand by my review and am pretty clear with the issues of this restaurant. I didn't just say. 'this place is crap so don't there'. I took the time to itemize it with 4 problems areas and included photos. Yelp exists to give unbiased and honest reviews by people and I am entitled to my opinion. Jennifer's final sentence of \"You are definitely not the customer we want dining with us\" is definitely a buyer beware to future patrons on how they treat customers.  I have since had Jennifer send me a private message inviting me to Inizio for some free gelato! Last week you don't want me, this week you welcome me with open arms! When I messaged her about it, she replied that she meant to send that message to another Andrea on Yelp. The pizza was bad enough, now I have to deal with this foolishness....."}
{"text":"The Bianca (white pizza) was so delicious!  Everyone in our group loved their order!  The Sat night crew was fun, attentive and we thoroughly enjoyed our experience.  Thanks for the tour Eli!"}
{"text":"Great pizza - a little expensive and they have some weird rules around the pizza itself.  They don't cut the pizza for you if you get it to go because it messes up the 'integrity' of the pizza They don't take ToGo orders over the phone to protect the 'integrity' of the pizza - (Pizza is America's #1 takeout food BTW)  Great product but they take themselves a little too seriously."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza I have ever eaten. My wife and I eat here often and have never had a bad meal. The pizzas are outstanding and so are the cannoli. Plenty of adult beverage options as well. We enjoy the half price wine bottles as well."}
{"text":"Best pizza place in Charlotte. The pepperoni itself is AMAZING !!!!!! And gelato best I've ever had! Totally recommend this place I've been coming ever since they opened and I'll continue to go it's worth the drive."}
{"text":"Hands down, BEST PIZZA IN CHARLOTTE!  I drive 20 minutes to Inizio's because I don't want to settle for anything less than the best.   I absolutely love Inizio's commitment to true Neopolitan pizza. It's refreshing to have authentic Neopolitan pizza in Charlotte.   They use imported Italian flour, ferment the dough for 3 days, and use the highest quality ingredients to make an amazing pizza!  THANK YOU INIZIO FOR BEING IN CHARLOTTE !!!"}
{"text":"We have been waiting for this place to open and I am delighted to say it's been worth the wait. We are pizza nuts and when we travel we always look for the best pizza places. So, from the originals in Naples, Italy to Motorino and Roberta's in NYC, to Pizzeria Bianco in Phoenix, we have tried the greats. While Inizio is not true authentic naples style (which are smaller and uncut) they really hit the mark with ingredients. The crust is tender with a nice chew and great char. The tomato sauce is flavorful without the sweetness. And to find Buffalo milk mozzarella on pizza in Charlotte, NC is a dream come true. Very few places outside of Naples offers this on every pizza.  If you have never had Naples style pizza you will see that it's different than Brooklyn style or any of the other Americanized ones. So don't try to compare it to Brixx or Portofinos. The closest thing in Charlotte is probably True Pizza which is an excellent and always consistent; you just can't get buffalo moz. At Inizo you can really taste the individual, ingredient flavors; they don't just run together. The only thing I'd change is to use a little less of the pecorino cheese as a garnish. We did recently try another new Neopolitian pizza place in Mooresville called Novanta 90. It was pretty good but not great and they don't have buffalo milk cheese even though their menu kind of implies it.  We tried two of the salads the chopped and the arugula. The later was excellent, the chopped was good but nothing special and a little heavy on the dressing for my taste. For desserts, we only tried the gelato; it was good but not excellent like Va De Vie on Park Road. The cheesecake really looked great so will try it next time. The beer and wine selection was perfect for us.  Another thing I should mention is the size of the pizza. A true Neapolitan pizza serves one person and is always over $10 outside of Italy. I'd say Inizio's serves three so it's actually a decent value at $18. I'd also say their salads serve three people. So if you are up to trying a different style of pizza in Charlotte put this one on your list; its excellent pizza.  Now we just need a great pasta place!"}
{"text":"I recently moved to Charlotte from New York and have been trying to find a go-to pizza place in the area. After trying Inizio over the weekend, the search is over!  I tried two pies -- the traditional Margherita as well as the Pistacchio. Both featured crust that was cooked to perfection, with slight crisp to the outside while remaining chewy on the inside. The Margherita featured a delicious tomato sauce while the pesto sauce on the Pistacchio had the added unique crunch of finely chopped pistachio nuts. Both were topped with fresh mozzarella, and I found the balance of sauce to cheese to be just right. Dessert was also wonderful. It was too difficult to choose between the cannoli or gelato, so I tried both and was not disappointed (I particularly recommend the chocolate and hazelnut gelato!).  In addition to serving delicious food, Inizio also provides incredibly efficient and conscientious service. I was asked multiple times by everyone from the servers to the cooks how I was enjoying my meal. The kindness of the Inizio team combined with the excellent meal ensured that I will be a return guest!"}
{"text":"My family and I missed the pizza here so we dropped by again last night. Ordered the Luigi pizza and caprese salad for dining in. First off - very pleased to see real plates and cutlery and it shows that they really do listen to customers' suggestions. The Luigi was also much better than the Diavola we had last time. Toppings were spread more evenly this time and the crust area was kept to just over an inch (see pics I posted). I have seen others mention the issue of \"too much crust\" so it looks like they've also addressed this as well.    Very impressed with their efforts to continually improve, and we can't wait to return soon to try the other pizza varieties. Well deserved jump from a 4 to 5 star review."}
{"text":"After hearing rave reviews for so long I finally went and got the pistacchio pizza. Took about 4 minutes from the time I ordered to have it delivered to my table. I was not disappointed. The pesto and rosemary flavors are spectacular. Only comment would be the crust was a little underdone for my tastes - like it nice and crispy and this still had a little dough-iness to it. But a minor detail. Definitely will return."}
{"text":"What a nice surprise to find this hidden gem in Charlotte. Tyler was very helpful and friendly in explaining the concept and offerings. We ordered the Diavola and the Capricciosa pizzas. They came out quickly and were very tasty. All the staff was very friendly. We will be back!"}
{"text":"The food was good, but expensive. The have you give a tip when you order/pay, which I did, but wish I would not have, since it's pretty much self serve everything. It's was also very loud! Not sure I'll go back."}
{"text":"Had the Margherita. The flavor was great. Only complaint about 4 slices were doughy. So will order well done next time. Liked the atmosphere and staff. Worth a visit if you haven't been. Looking forward to trying other pies."}
{"text":"The more I try Neapolitan pizza, the more convinced I am that it's the only type of pizza I will be ordering from now on (apologies to Lou Malnati's!)...believe the hype and try this place for yourself: Order any of the pizzas and you too will agree that their authentic/simple/quality is far superior than the flash and chaos American style pizza offers. Definitely my vote for best pizza in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Excellent example of Neapolitan pizza. First in Charlotte, fresh ingredients, authentic 00 flour crust!  Crew is extremely friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Pizza & chopped salad we're great, until I saw 3 cockroaches come out from under the brick wall & crawl up the wall right behind my seat"}
{"text":"The most delicious pizza! I've tried 4 different pies and they're all equally good. Can't wait to go back. Gelato is fantastic. Customer service is excellent too."}
{"text":"The pizza is good, but really expensive for what it is. Salad's are \"ok\". Waitstaff needs refining. Not sure we will be back."}
{"text":"Omg. This place is unbelievable. We had the diavolo pizza, cooked in 90 seconds in the 900 degree oven. The crust was perfect and they gave us extra marinara for dipping. Another person in our party got the chopped salad and I almost had food envy. Almost . I cannot believe this place isn't busier for lunch. It's certainly a new go to spot for us."}
{"text":"Went a couple weeks ago, this is the real deal for sure. The fast casual nature and communal seating might not be for everyone, but I don't mind. I tried the special pizza with brussels sprouts and pancetta. It was excellent, perfect amount of toppings and delicious, perfectly charred dough. Next time I'm in town I will try a few more pizzas, they all look awesome! I would love to see a few wood fired small plates or something, but for a quick Neapolitan pizza fix this fits the bill."}
{"text":"This is the only pizza I will eat in Charlotte NC. It is true Italian . The crust is light and thin and the sauce is perfect.  The arugula salad is my favorite.  The dressing is light and tangy. Absolutely the best !!"}
{"text":"Finally this style of pizza is available in Charlotte! I have been craving this for years after moving here from New York, and having lived in DC in the past.   Excellent pizza with high quality ingredients. I just wish they had a location closer to Uptown.   One suggestion would be to offer a smaller size individual pizza-their offerings are great, but they have to be shared.   Can't wait to go back-definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"I can't pronounce the restaurant but I can clearly say it gets 5 stars. I was not expecting such fun and interesting Neapolitan style pizza in a location like this. The inside is adorable and has hardwood picnic table style seating, so you might be sitting next to people you don't know. I found the pizza to be super inventive and fun. They use a particular flour called 00 flour and fresh yeast, sea salt, and water to make the crust. They've imported 2 large scale ovens from Italy that bake a pizza in 90 seconds flat at nearly 900 degrees. The crust is by far the best I've had in Charlotte. The pistachio pizza is a customer favorite that has pistachios, a pistachio-pesto sauce, mozzarella, garlic, and ricotta. It was amazing with a memorable nutty-pesto taste that you will not get tired of. We also had a special pizza made with a pumpkin-based sauce and buffalo mozzarella. It had a fun, earthy-fall taste that I made me come back for more. I only wish that I had made room for the gelato, as it looked absolutely wonderful. The service was impeccable and the place was very clean. They have wine and a few beers on draft. You order and pay at the counter and they deliver to your table. I've heard that on the weekends it is extremely busy and filled with children and wine-drinking parents. So, it'll be a weekday spot for me."}
{"text":"Cannot rate the food because we never got to order a pie due to they will not make ANY changes to the pies.  It was my husband and I and I do not eat meat.  We tried to order a pie that had veggies and ham but we asked for no ham on one half and was told they could not take ham off of half.  We then tried to order an all veggie but it had no tomato sauce and I asked if they could put tomato sauce and again was told NO CHANGES to the pies.  I then tried to order a Margherita pie with all veggies and she said they could only do two toppings.  That is when my husband got very frustrated and we walked out."}
{"text":"This is probably the best pizza I've had in Charlotte. Everything was unbelievably fresh and flavorful. Great service and great food! Rafaelle pizza was outstanding"}
{"text":"Best pizza in town. Authentic and always top-notch. My favorites are the margherita and the cavoletti!"}
{"text":"Finally, awesome pizza in Charlotte! Seriously, amazing! Imported ingredients from Italy make these pizzas incredible! The Margherita is so simple, but full of fresh flavor. The Pistacchio is just unreal. Go! Try it! NOW!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place but I can't see myself going there again.  It's expensive 'gourmet' pizza that isn't mind blowing, the dough had a nice texture but was flavorless, the toppings just kind of blended together into a boring pie, and the sauce is pretty watery.  It feels like most of what you're paying for is pretentiousness.  The pizza I got was not bad, but not worth the $$$ for only a 14\" pizza.   I was going to call in an order to pick up and the person on the phone  informed me that they don't do call in orders because their pizzas only take 90 seconds to cook.  Fair enough, I figured I'd just drive down and be in and out in 5 minutes.  When I got there it wasn't too busy, walked right up to the counter without having to wait, I placed my order and the guy said something about not slicing the pizza because of 'maintaining it's integrity' or some such nonsense.  I then waited for over 20 minutes despite customers being out numbered by employees 2 to 1.  Seriously! That is exactly why I wanted to call ahead, so I wouldn't have to wait around.   If I had payed $15 for the pizza I'd say it was totally worth putting up with the pretention, but for a $25 pizza it was, meh."}
{"text":"We have found our new favorite pizza place in Charlotte! Great pizza is hard to come by here in Charlotte and Inizio has blown all others out of the water. They don't have your typical American pizza, greasy, loaded with cheese and dripping in oil. Inizio has a simply delicious neapolitan pizza which is hard to recreate. The kicker is, their gelato is amazing and a lovely way to end your meal! Will def be going back with the Fam!!!"}
{"text":"Great authentic pizza - crust just right and love having fresh garlic available to add as you like. Nice selection of craft beers as well and the cheesecake was delicious. Good atmosphere too. First of many visits for us."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to the pizza based on the reviews. However, I was very underwhelmed and regretted ordering from here. The Margehrita was very skimpy on the basil. We added prosciutto but it was not prosciutto. Rather it looked and tasted like your average supermarket deli ham. I get that you want us to respect \"the craft\" and all, but please respect your customers and provide a quality product."}
{"text":"I like to think that I know good pizza. I'm Italian, which basically makes me an expert :P. Inizio is hands down the BEST pizza I've had in my life. I tried the pistachio pesto, and it changed my life. The homemade cannoli is amazing as well. I can't wait to go back and try what else they have to offer."}
{"text":"Will go again for sure. It won't get the spicy sausage pizza. Peppers were sooooo salty. Kids enjoyed the plain. Fun atmosphere. Gets busy. Outdoor seating available on nice nights. Shared tables inside."}
{"text":"Went there today with the kids. Very nice place, love what they've done to the former Wolfman restaurant. Very friendly and attentive service, will definitely go again. Absolutely love the crust, great job of coming close to real Italian pizza! Overall however I personally prefer Lorenzo's pizza but that's just me..."}
{"text":"Prepared in 90 seconds! Thinner crust with fresh toppings. Not to mention the service is incredible. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Just went to Inizio's, and I am in love! We brought our Italian foreign exchange student, and for the first time in 3 weeks we finally found pizza that he claimed was \"real pizza\". We also had the cannoli and he said it wasn't how it is made in Italy, but it is still absolutely delicious. The service was also excellent!"}
{"text":"I have lived in Charlotte for 21 years and this is hands down the best pizza I've ever had in the area.  I'm from New Haven, so I'm a total pizza purist, but Inizio's won me over.  Ordering was quick and easy, the place was crowded but a table opened up right away.  My family selected a pistachio pesto and a Luigi and neither disappointed.  The crust was really amazing and even the marinara sauce used to dip it in was beyond expectations.  The pizza is both soft and has a slight burn on the bottom which makes it crispy and super tasty.    You can tell the folks that work there take pride in their service; we were approached by 4 different employees during our meal who were very pleasant.    When my girlfriend mentioned she had never had a cannoli before (I know, right?  But she's awesome, trust me) a chef named Peter was walking by and just happened to overhear her.  Within a couple minutes he brought her one of the best cannolis I've ever had on the house.   It really made our night.  I know I'm gushing about this place, but I'm not usually excited to go straight back to a new restaurant... Inizio's is the real deal and their pies are pricey but worth every cent!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza!! My only complaint is the price. It's a tad pricey for what you get.  Super yummy!!"}
{"text":"After returning home from our recent Italian honeymoon, my newly minted husband and I were A) head over heels in love with the pizza we had while in Italy and B) bummed that nothing in Charlotte tasted at all similar. We stumbled upon Inizio Pizza one night and were delighted to realize we had finally found what we were searching for....pizza that tasted just like the ones over in Italy. The ingredients were super fresh, the crust absolutely perfect and the recipes kept simple, allowing for the taste to shine. We have now declared this adorable gem of a restaurant \"our spot\" and look forward to many visits in our future."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Give the pistachio pizza a try! Luckily I live a good bit away or I'd eat it a lot more. Best pizza in Charlotte"}
{"text":"Authentic people, serving authentic neapolitan pies, who should be appreciated for their craft.   Anyone who has made pizza dough at home from scratch knows that true neapolitan dough requires care and patience to get right. Inizio's crust is suberb. Wonderful flavors that are coaxed out of a dough made only with flour, yeast, salt and water.  The Italian made wood fired ovens give just the right amount of char.   We had the Capricciosa pie. Good quality toppings. The ham was thicker than store bought prosciutto, which held up well in their 900 degree oven. Great tomato flavor from the sauce. Was a bit runny after the pizza rested and cooled a bit, maybe due to some moisture release from the mushrooms, and the thin crust got a bit soggy. But the simple combination of flavors brought a smile to our faces as we washed everything down with some Copper drafts.  Friday evening at 6pm and there was a line out the door, but it moved quickly thanks to the hard working staff and those quick cooking 900 degree ovens. We really enjoyed the communal tables and chatting with the family next to us.  A little pricey but we weren't expecting mega chain pizza. As a newly opened restaurant there will be some kinks to work out. Good to know that we don't have to travel to CT or NY for authentic neapolitan pizza. We'll be back to try another."}
{"text":"Tasty pizza with interesting toppings on a great chewy crust."}
{"text":"This place is bangin'! Great to find authentic napoletana pizza in the greater south end/dilworth area. Had the diavola pizza which had a perfect amount of heat to it. Great beer selection on draft as well. Definitely will be back soon."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Charlotte. And it's not even close. Also have a great salad and gelato. It's comparable to Antico in Atlanta for those who have been."}
{"text":"The pizza is delicious, we had the pistacchio and I am not sure if I have ever eaten anything better. Our pizza was followed up with a cannoli which was equally divine. I cannot wait to go back and eat again"}
{"text":"Excellent wood fired pizza. I heard about this place through an Instagram account and it looked so good I had to go down there and try it.  Atmosphere is contemporary and clean and they had Dean Martin playing in the background.   Service was very good. The guy behind the counter tonight made great suggestions to me and was helpful with what to substitute a meat topping for on my pizza, as I was looking for only veggies.  The price is high ($18-22) for a pie but they are fairly large. It is still around what I would pay at another pizza place with lower quality ingredients.  I wasn't planning on spending that much but I really enjoyed it.   I also tried a cannoli - whoever makes the filling is a genius. It is so hard to find a good cannoli in Charlotte as most places settle with pre made filling. They fill them and dip them there.  I live somewhat far away and will visit when possible but I wish the business all the best!"}
{"text":"Tasted just like the pizza in Italy! The ingredients, especially the sauce, were fresh and perfectly prepared. We will return!"}
{"text":"Food quality is top-notch. Everything is made in house and super fresh. Folks, this is gourmet pizza at its finest."}
{"text":"Fantastic. The pizza tasted great and came out fast. We sat outside, which was really nice. Very causal atmosphere, good for one person or larger groups. You order at the front area, and You might have to Google some of the ingredients or ask what they are. We got the Bianca and the Rafael. The cashier mentioned that we could order the pizza as usual or well done if we wanted it more typically American and crispy. We ordered as usual, and no complaints. The marinara is delicious. Our one request would be more drink options. They have free water and infused water. Their only other options are a handful of bottled Coke products, bottled water, sparkling water,  flavored sparkling water and local beer and wine."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic and authentic Neopolitan pizza! We had the pistachio pesto pie and the sausage and peppers pie (I forget the names from the menu) and both were amazing. I've missed true Neopolitan pizza since moving away from NYC, but this is the real deal!"}
{"text":"It was pretty busy, with a big line, but it moved quickly. The chopped salad was good. With imported ingredients it literally tastes like authentic Italian pizza. I have already started recommending it to my friends =)"}
{"text":"Wow! House hunting in Charlotte from Boston. I read about this place in Charlotte magazine. Came for lunch with the whole family. Absolutely delicious!! Arugula salad was so fresh, the parmigiana cut perfect, the cherry tomatoes fantastic. My judge of a pizza place is the margherita, not even a piece of crust left on the tray. My wife favorite pizza in Italy is the capricciosa, she took the last piece from me with a smile saying sorry it's mine."}
{"text":"Before Inzio, Pure Pizza was my favorite shop in town. I hadn't had too many places that could come close.  Both pizzerias excel in an ultra-thin crust with a fast bake and sublime ingredients. It's not NY style, it's thinner than that. Both are a bit expensive all things considered.  This pizza is heavily browned or blackened on the outside crust bubbles, while the middle is just done enough to reduce the chewiness to an acceptable level. The meats and vegetables are absolutely sublime. I'd feel free to experiment with toppings, but their menu offerings are solid.  My only gripe is this ultra-fast bake also produces inordinate moisture. The very center of the pizza falls apart since water doesn't have time to evaporate in the oven unlike more traditional american pizzas. Your pizza will drip water and grease to an extent, but even the water coming off each slice is hugely flavorful.  The gelato is good and I'd get it again, but the pizza is incredible. My barometer for superior pizza is this: If you can't think of anything else but the slices in your fridge, ruminating over them constantly until you give up and eat them just an hour or two after getting home, then the pizza place is doing something right. Inizio does that with flying colors."}
{"text":"I'm from NY so I know good pizza and that's hard to find here in Charlotte..Well I was not disappointed at all.. I just tried this place tonight and the pizza is amazing.. All of the ingredients are top notch and you can seriously taste? the difference.. this isn't no Papa John's /Domino's cheap horrible tasting pizza.. the canolie and gelato were also Soo delicious.. I will definitely go back again!!!"}
{"text":"Just got back from a trip to NYC and had to try this place to compare the pizza. After just having a couple of great slices from Joe's pizza midtown, I must say that I have my pizza standards set very high. Well Inizio definitely reached and exceeded those with their tasty pizza. I got a small Raphael and a small pistachio pie. You definitely don't have to go all the way to NYC for great pizza."}
{"text":"I've been there twice, and my husband and I agree this is easily one of our favorite pizza places EVER. I can't actually think of any I like more. Both times I've been there, the service has been great and the food has been delicious and served quickly! Can't wait to go back and keep working our way through the menu."}
{"text":"As a proud New Havener... I can safely say Inizio is as close to Wooster St. as you can get! Amazing pizza and service!"}
{"text":"The buffalo mozzarella melts perfectly on top of the pizza. Love the long cut pepperoni too. The house salad was also very tasty. Worth every $$$"}
{"text":"There are a ton of pizza restaurants in Charlotte...seems like one or two new ones pop up every week.  Inizio is one of the best!  I love authentic pizza Napoletno or Roma...fired in Italian ovens for 90 seconds.  Inizio's is a nice thin crust but still a little chewy with a little bit of char on the bottom...love it.  Pistachio pesto pizza is numero uno...unique and irresistible."}
{"text":"First, the pizza is really good. So why the three stars? Value and experience.  Value - 1 pizza, 1 salad, and 2 beers = $45. I get that they are importing ingredients and trying to deliver an \"authentic\" pizza but $50 is steep.   Experience - $50 shouldn't feel like fast food. You place your own order, search for your own place to sit among the communal tables, get your own water, get your own plates, get your own to-go box, get your own utensils out of a bucket on each table. We would have gotten a second beer but would have had to stand in line again. As soon as we stopped chewing someone was there to clear the table, and because people are standing around waiting for a place to sit you feel rushed. Also, insanely loud.   Again, the pizza is really good but at this price point you should enjoy the experience as well."}
{"text":"I haven't written a review in a while but I felt compelled after eating dinner here last night! It was fantastic! My hubby and I ordered the caprese salad and pistachio pizza. The fresh mozzarella on the salad was delicious and the pizza was the best I have had in a long time. The crust was the perfect chewiness and the fresh pesto sauce and cheese on top was so tasty. We couldn't get over how good it was. They also brought out marinara to use as dipping sauce for the crust, so good! The staff was also great, they were helpful and friendly. They brought out the food quickly and checked if you needed anything. This place really has it together! And I can't forget to mention the gelato, I had the a small cup of the salted caramel gelato after dinner and it was so good! I'm really excited to have found this place and can't wait to take family and friends soon."}
{"text":"We have been looking for a good wood fire pizza since we moved to Charlotte. I felt like I am walking into a food court when we walked in the door. Very casual setting with a great quality pizza.  We had the pistachio pizza and I will definitely be back for more. I cannot wait to try other pizza on the menu as well."}
{"text":"Great fast casual pizza! Great ambiance and employees! Oh and did I mention the cannolis?? Heaven!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza stop! LOVE the decor and feel of the restaurant-- light distressed wood and metal everywhere with an open feel. The lighting is spot on. Indoor and outdoor seating is both very inviting. The margherita pizza was a solidly good pie and we ordered a dish of pepperoni on the side, which was delicious! The dressing on the arugula salad was light and crisp and refreshing with just the right amount of tart. Thursday $2.00 small gelato night was an extra bonus. Have been wishing for an authentic pizza place with fresh ingredients and a real deal feel - this fits the bill. In my opinion the pizza was definitely more flavorful than Alino's and not nearly as thin/soggy (even though this pizza is thin, too.) Will DEFINITELY be back to Inizio's!"}
{"text":"Great caprese salad, pizza, and cannoli. All this place is missing is prosecco in order to offer all of my favorite Italian things. :) All jokes aside, we highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Margherita and Capricciosa pizzas. Their mozzarella cheese wasn't the best, but their Margherita pizza was cooked perfectly with a soft crust and nice char. I would come back for more. I wasn't a fan of the prosciutto ham on their Capricciosa pizza though. Save room for gelato, because it was a great way to end our meal."}
{"text":"This is NOT a takeout restaurant. Just picked up a $30 pizza 3 minutes before the website said it would be ready and it is so cold that it seems as though it was made before we even ordered it. They also did not slice it. Maybe they are better if you dine in but this was such a terrible experience that I'm not even trying that. Good luck."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best pizza in Charlotte! The pizza scene in Charlotte has improved a lot in the last few years but Inizio has set a new bar height for all the others to follow. To find 5-star food anywhere is rare but adding to their superb food is their 5-star service. True, this is \"order when you enter\" but the entire staff seems to go out of their way to be sure \"everything is OK\". This is one of those places well worth coming back to several times!!"}
{"text":"The BEST wood-fired pizza in NC since we moved from Illinois. I mentioned our old familiar pizza place called http://www.peelpizza.com/seasonal-fruit-pizza/ to see if they can add a dessert fruit pizza to their menu.  Felicia was helpful and served us some great pizza today.  I\"ll be back for sure."}
{"text":"This review is based on 2 day old leftover margherita pizza, haha. My daughter went to Inizio's and brought home 2 slices Friday night. I heated them in the broiler for a couple minutes for breakfast today (this was 2 days later only because I was doing a 3 day program that didn't include pizza) and wow I can't wait to go there in person and see what the pizza tastes like when it's right out of the oven!! Even with the leftover pizza half heated I could taste the quality of the ingredients. The dough is chewy and slightly (perfectly) salty, sauce is simple and well seasoned, cheese light (no grease dripping off) and really tasty. One slice had a big leaf of basil, yum.   Comparing this pizza to a fast food chain (papa john's, etc) is really like comparing bananas to hot dogs. Similar shape, but that's where the similarities end. I read the reviews and understand people are concerned about the price, but you really do get what you pay for. The high quality non-GMO ingredients in Inizio's pizza are far more nourishing to our bodies than the overly processed (devoid of nutrients) crap the other guys use and it's quite filling. From the pics I saw posted, the pies look huge and I'd imagine 1 would easily feed 4 people, maybe with a little salad to go with.   Folks at Inizio's: Thank you for bringing high quality, superior pizza to our neighborhood! You're in good company with the Whole Foods going up down the road (YAY!!) and I'm sure my fellow Charloteans will be supporting you to great success. I might be seeing you for lunch today, lol."}
{"text":"First time - very very good.  Could use some more in door seating.   Being able to see the ovens is very cool.  A+ overall"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing! Superb pizza, fast service, cool atmosphere. Grab a beer and find a table! Love the family/picnic style eating. I usually eat here at least once a month and have never been disappointed because I get the Diavola pie every time, but they all sound delicious enough to try. Once they forgot to put one ingredient on the pie and we were fine to eat it anyways (which is did), but right before we left they came out with the accurate pizza and let us take it home! That's how it's done. Love to see a place that takes so much pride in it's pizza and treats customers well. Hoping this place is around for a while! Keep it up!!"}
{"text":"My husband is a lover of pizza so with all the buzz going around about this place, we had to try it. When we entered, we were immediately greeted with a smiling staff member welcoming us. We took a bit to review their menu which had several delicious choices. We ordered the Capricciosa - prosciutto ham, mushrooms, sauce and buffalo mozzarella (loving this cheese). Many of the chain pizza places use too much sauce which drowns out the taste of the other ingredients. Well, you will not get that here - just enough sauce and a hearty helping of fresh ingredients.  Watching the staff create our masterpiece was a plus. From tossing the dough to piling on of the toppings to entering their wood fire oven. While waiting, we ordered a couple of beers. They have six brews on tap and also wine available. We were stoked to find out all their pizzas are 16\"! Score on the leftovers!!! We also noticed they have desserts too (gelato, cannolis, and cheesecake), so save some room. From what I heard, their cheesecake is worthy of a cheat day to treat yourself. Also, if you order a salad, be prepared as they serve up healthy portions that can feed at least four.   While enjoying our brews and pizza, we noticed that the staff members appeared to be cross trained as they switched between positions - taking orders, prepping the pizza, cleaning tables, and cooking. They worked and communicated well with each other and one could tell that it was a positive working environment. I loved that every customer who dined in was greeted by a staff member at some point during their stay.   We really enjoyed this place. They have picnic style tables, napkins and silverware provided on each table, and pre-made items to either take for take out orders or season will eating in. They share a parking lot but we had no problem finding parking. This place gets busy around 5:30 pm, so be patient. The staff moves customers along efficiently, clean tables quickly and there is a lot of sitting inside and out.  Bravo!!!!!"}
{"text":"Not your typical American pizza! This is truly Italian (they even import water from Italy to use in the dough). The crust is soft and thin, the toppings are simple and flavorful, and it doesn't leave you feeling full of bread. A nice cup of marinara comes on the side to dip the pizza in and it's great as well. The outdoor benches are a nice change and they even have a gelato bar. I had the chocolate chip gelato and it was amazing! I love how their gelato is kind of chewy and dense. I can't say enough good things about the food here."}
{"text":"We picked this place based off of the strong Yelp reviews and we were not disappointed. The pizza was excellent and ingredients were all extremely fresh. The decor and atmosphere were also very inviting. We brought our kids and were in/out within 40 minutes, which was great. Nice staff and positive experience- we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Met another couple here for dinner one night and whoa!  When they said they wanted to go out for pizza we were not as gung-ho as we should have been for this place! This is not your usual pizza. Their toppings are incredibly fresh and range all the way to Italian classic broccoli rabe. The crust is perfect and the cheese is obviously good quality. They have these huge ovens that are ultra hot and makes for a perfect pizza.   Their cheesecake was also incredible.   With local beer on tap as icing on the cake this is a great spot for a pie and brew!"}
{"text":"Delicious as always. They missed an item on my order but resolved it ASAP.  Just excellent customer service."}
{"text":"Super cute! Order at the counter and share table space with other patrons. Atmosphere is great!   The pizza was great and the service was exceptional! Every bite was delicious including the crust!! We ordered the sausage, pepper, onion, buffalo mozzarella and highly recommend. It came with an extra side of sauce which we were able to use to dip the crust.   John gave us a complimentary cannoli which was delicious and very appreciated!   Can't wait for the Southend location to open so we can eat here more!"}
{"text":"This is the pizza pregnancy cravings are made of! I discovered Inizio recently and have visited four times already. The pizza is incredibly fresh and the flavor combinations are like I've never had before. I'm not a big sauce fan and find myself craving the sauce used on their pizza. Not to mention, the staff is friendly and the environment is very laid back."}
{"text":"I was craving for the longest to try this pizza but i got so bloated and sick the rest of the day after eating it. Great place though"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza! Salads are awesome. It's all very authentic Italian style. (Been there! I know!) Usually comes out really quickly. We had to wait a long time once because of a computer system glitch and the manager made sure to come apologize and gave us a gift card for our trouble. Aside from being pricey all the rest is 5 star!"}
{"text":"Las pizzas más originales que he comido , la de pistachos OMG la mejor si. Duda alguna . Es la reina de la casa ."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza!!! We ordered margherita and diavola pizza and both were spectacular. We have been to Naples and had pizza there and the pizza at Inizio is the closest we have been able to find in the US. The sauce is delicious!!! The restaurant is really well decorated and has a great atmosphere and we loved the tables. The staff was also super friendly. Loved every bit of it; we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Was happy to find good quality 'Brooklyn' style pizza. Just moving back to Charlotte from NYC, I was missing the pizza and this is the closest thing I've found to the coal fired perfection of places like Juliana's in Brooklyn.  The staff was super friendly, the restaurant had great decor, and attention to detail was obvious even with the lemon infused table water and oil canisters.   If you want good pizza in south Charlotte, don't miss this place."}
{"text":"This is one of my absolute favorite pizza places in the world! The quality alone could sell it! But add in the amazingly friendly people working and the service is fantastic! I always highly recommend Inizio Pizza to anyone who asks where they can get good pizza! Thank you for existing and making my life complete"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza!  Great and friendly service. General Manager Chris and server Abby made you feel welcome.  Gelato was incredible!  Quite a busy restaurant. Will return!"}
{"text":"Yum! One of the first places I ate when I moved to charlotte after somehow finding their Instagram showcasing their pumpkin pizzas and cannolis. Did not disappoint. Have also had a margarita pizza and it was delicious as well. Have only taken it to go and never dined in but it has always been good. It can be small in there. I picked up for a delivery seevice on a Friday night and it was extremely busy! Looking forward to trying their pistachio pizza"}
{"text":"Definitely the best pizza in town. True Neopolitan pizza using authentic flour in a wood burning oven. It is a bit expensive but worth the treat.     Sounds a bit odd but try the pesto pizza."}
{"text":"Easily the best pizza in charlotte. Service was fast. Pizza was delicious. Everything was so fresh. Good beer specials."}
{"text":"Wow. What an amazing lunch experience I had the margarita pizza not knowing what to expect. Being a New Yorker I judge pizza heavily and this place beat all my expectations. Seriously fresh delicious and authentic. I normally don't write reviews but this place earner all of my 5 stars wish I could give them more."}
{"text":"Originally I would give them all stars. There quality has gone down some. The pizza is still ok, but the salad was terrible.   Bianca & Margarita pizza - both ok!   Cesar Salad- the romaine was old and wet almost like it was frozen and brought back to room temperature.   Cesar dressing was good"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza!  We tried three of their pizzas and an arugula salad.  Not a bad one in the bunch.  The price makes it a special occasion only restaurant though."}
{"text":"Take out- Disappointed.  We wanted to try this pizza based on several great reviews from neighbors.  I just got home and we tried it.  The pizza smells great, but ours was not fully cooked.  The center of the pizza was floppy and drippy.  The salami was good, but there was too much of it to make the pizza too salty....  $22 pizza in the trash.  Maybe they have some kinks to work out or we were unlucky.  It will be awhile before we try it again.  Since we live less than a mile from them, it's a shame.  UPDATE:  Tonight we went back and dined in.  The seating was ample and it was a friendly environment.  We tried the margherita pizza.  It was ready in a few minutes.  I will just say, it was very good pizza.  While the center was still under cooked, the pizza tasted great.  We had to cut about 3\" off of each slice so the kids could eat it with a fork because it was not firm like the rest of the pie.  This was not an issue for the adults.  It came with just the right amount of basil and cheese.  We really loved this pizza and are glad we gave this place another try.    The key here is that take out just did not seem to work.  Dining in was great...  It also allowed us to try the gelato!"}
{"text":"I'm glad this place is a serious hike from my house, otherwise I'd be tempted to go more often.  The atmosphere is great.  Nice, but super casual so you don't feel bad having kids in there.  There are long communal picnic style tables, so if you have a big party like we did, you'd better go during an off time.  It was crazy busy on a Friday night at 6:30, despite the crazy torrential downpour of rain.    Things to note: Limited menu.  One size of pizza (large).  Prices are a bit on the high end ($22 for my Pistachio Pizza). All bottled drinks (no fountain), and no table service.  Get in line as soon as you walk in the door, order your food and take a number to an open table.  While there's technically no table service, there are a TON of employees walking around cleaning up and asking if you need anything else.    The food was really good.  As mentioned in other reviews, the PISTACHIO PIZZA is their specialty and very tasty.  I'm really particular on pizza.  If I'm wasting calories, I want it to be worth it.  This fell into the category of \"worth it.\"  Instead of red sauce, the base is a pistachio pesto, with mozzarella and ricotta on top.  I needed a ton of salt & pepper, but that's typical for my taste buds.  When I return, I'll order the next one with light cheese, as I find the standard amount of cheese to be too much and too greasy.  And lighter cheese just might make the bottom a little crispier.  It's impossible to get a crisp crust when you have a ton of sauce, cheese or toppings.  The dough was soft and pillowy on the edges while still being thin in the middle and having a touch of crisp.  I liked that the pizza was served with a small container of red sauce for dipping the crust.    My husband ordered the CHOPPED SALAD and found it very filling.  It had plenty of meat (salami? other cold cuts?) and a variety of vegetables.  The house dressing was tasty and overall he was satisfied (not easy when ordering a salad for a meal).    The GELATO was interesting.  I liked the SALTED CARAMEL GELATO best out of the three flavors I tried (chocolate chip - bland; and hazelnut - odd).  My only complaint is that it was too melty even straight out of the freezer.  The CANNOLI was pretty standard. Nothing super special and nothing bad.  I like the cannoli cream to be a touch sweeter, but that's just my personal preference.    Overall, this was a great choice for a family dinner with a bunch of friends and their kids.  We liked the food, the service & the atmosphere, and I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"One if the best pizza places ever. Different and worth a try. Not cheap but they use quality ingredients.   Charlotte and the surrounding burbs have quite a few decent pizza places to choose from, and many are New York 'style' (Mario's, True Crafted, NY Pizza Express, Pie 5, Brixx, etc.), but this one is different and REALLY GOOD. We have been to Italy several times, and this is the closest we have found to true southern Italian pizzas like we have found in Capri, Naples, Sorrento, etc. It was great! They imported the ovens from Italy, and they flash cook the pies with simple fresh ingredients so that the middle is still soft, and the crust puffs up to a chewy texture. They aren't cheap, but you can tell that the ingredients are high quality. One 16 inch thin crust pizza with a drink was about $30, and fed two of us. Anyway - go try it! I predict that this one will be popular. ...oh, and the Sea Salted Caramel gelato was awesome, too. Inizio Pizza is located in a former Wolfman pizza storefront. ...the communal seating is a little weird, but you'll get over it once you taste the pizza."}
{"text":"Not sure if I just came on an off day...not that impressed. Good Neapolitan style pizza but nothing amazing...Aliño in Mooresville is a WAY better version of this exact concept...sauce is good but a little too acid, crust is thin and very good topping were ok....that's all it was OK."}
{"text":"Good pizza but not great. Very expensive as far as pizza goes. The pepperoni was crazy greasy.  Service is good and food comes fast. With all the Napolitano pizza places around now, this is worth a try but I wouldn't go out of my was to get it."}
{"text":"Good Pizza GREAT customer service & Good Atmosphere. My family and I have frequented this place on several occasions ranging from Tuesday to Family lunch outing to teenager birthday luncheon.   The staff are so welcoming and readily available to help you make a choice and to share and discuss the history and the story behind the ovens from Italy that were hand made.   We have enjoyed a number of pizzas from margarita to white sauce to cheese. All were flavorful and brought out piping HOT. The picnic tables ambiance is very relaxing and communal like. We met some nice folks sitting at these long hard wood tables.  I tried my first cannoli here as I never tried one before the cashier spoke so highly of it and shared with me that they make them fresh for you to watch. I was intrigued so I gave it a whirl and not was it good. I had the Pistachio.  Great place tucked in the shopping center."}
{"text":"We really like Inizio and appreciate that it is a great place to take our two small children. The pizza is great and I definitely recommend dining in."}
{"text":"Phenomenal pistachio pizza! The combination of crust, pistachios, pesto, spices and amazing tender dough makes this one of the best pizzas in Charlotte!!  The pistachio pesto was incredible & made me want to devour the pizza. You have to go for takeout because they want the pizza to be fresh. They also don't recommend cutting the pie until you get home to preserve the freshness. I will definitely be a return customer!  The customer service by the staff is amazing because the pizza they made me was slightly burned so they made me another pizza. They were so kind!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh!! The pizza here is OUTSTANDING!!! Extremely fresh ingredients, love the Buffalo Mozzarella, Caprese salad was dynamite!!! This place is near my parents' house but I will be happy to drive 30 minutes to come back for their food!!!!"}
{"text":"The first time we came here we had the Maria which was absolutely delicious!! The second time we tried the pistachio one and that is absolutely sublime! It is a MUST try! There was a piece of ham on our Maria the second time around so they remade the whole thing. They have these delicious chili peppers that are a must try! Not too hot, just perfect! I liked them so much that I found them online and bought them! Their gelato is delicious too, the chocolate, strawberry, chocolate chip and salted caramel are all good!!!  To top it all their service is superfast!"}
{"text":"Went to Inizio tonight with a party of 10 and had the best pizza in Charlotte!! Peter, the manager, was very accommodating for our large party and suggested amazing menu items that we all loved! Hidden gem off of Providence Rd & Definitely reccomend!!"}
{"text":"The new dilworth location is amazing!!! Peter is awesome and is always so accommodating! The pizza tastes like a slice of Italy and the atmosphere is unbeatable. This is the BEST PIZZA IN CHARLOTTE! The patio/outside area is super dog friendly and perfect for a date night or family outing! Definitely recommend going to either location although the dilworth location has the best outside patio!! Come here for great pizza, people & service!!"}
{"text":"By far the best pizza in Charlotte.    Heard about this place and finally had a chance to eat here  and it did not disappoint.   Crust was spot on well developed and full of flavor.  Toppings are high quality and amazing and sauce complements the pizza.   Will be back and I am so happy this place is in Charlotte it is as good of pizza of what you would find in any big city in America."}
{"text":"Loved the Italian style pizza. Had the special of the day with pancetta and brusell sprouts...wonderful! A little on the pricey side but excellent food and the mocha canolli was made fresh and was soooo good!"}
{"text":"I came in a few weeks ago after reading some very good reviews and it did not disappoint! The restaurant had a nice ambience, the employees were friendly and most importantly the pizza was quite delicious. It tasted fresh and the crust was perfect, although I bet it could have been cooked even a touch longer to make it crispier. They cooked super fast bc of their Italian ovens (which I asked to see #nerdalert, I know, but they are so cool!) I'm a very picky pizza eater (from NJ, it's part of my makeup) and my only complaint about this restaurant is that it's not closer to my house! I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"We tried this place for the first time! The pizza was amazing! I don't think I want pizza from anywhere else! The sauce was on the side but after tasting the pizza without it, we didn't need it. It was 2 of us and we are a large! You have to try it once!"}
{"text":"This place is excellent! I love how fresh the pizza tastes and it feels so light on your stomach. The Caesar salad is really a solid pair with the pizza. Cannolis are delicious!"}
{"text":"Just stop asking where good pizza is in Charlotte and drive here and cry that you ever thought to go anywhere else. The white pizza is incredible but you cannot go wrong with any option. Honestly, you should go into a shame spiral for not knowing this place existed before."}
{"text":"Fantastic neopalitan style pizza, hands down the best in CLT. Did a course abroad in Italy during college and this is right on par with the motherland. We gently waded into the waters with the Margherita, and then ventured out to the pistachio pizza, which has pesto, ground pistachio, and hunks of fresh ricotta. It is now our go to. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Stop what you are doing and GO to Inizio's! Now!   Is it worth the drive to south CLT? Yes, yes it is.   I have been looking for \"my favorite pizza\" in CLT and I have finally found it! This place is wonderful. I, of course, checked them out on Yelp before going and everyone was saying the Pistachio pizza was what to order. I will admit, I was scared. Order it. It's amazing. The perfect amount of cheese, with great flavor! I'm not sure if this comes with, but we were given some tomato sauce for dipping, which was great to dip our crust ends in. We also got a more basic pizza, which was also fantastic. We ate every, single bite.   I will say, I was a little disappointed in the cannoli. I wouldn't order it again. However, the salted caramel gelato was a prefect end to a wonderful meal."}
{"text":"Inizio Pizza Napoletana strives to the art and craft of  neapolitan style pizza.   This pizza making stripped down to its purest and  fresh ingredients. It must follow strict standards and cook handcrafted pies are made with top shelf imported Italian  ingredients.   When trying any neapolitan place I always get my favorite and baseline pie, the MARGHERITA. This pie comes with San Marzano Tomato Sauce, Buffalo Mozzarella, Basil, Garlic, Pecorino. Simple and delicious, done pretty good here.  But our favorite was the MARIA. Which vomes worth Seasonal Mushroom Blend, Truffle Crema, Roasted Garlic, Buffalo Mozzarella, Sea Salt, Pecorino. This was very balanced and popping with flavor."}

{"text":"Pizza was just OK.  I found the pizza to be very salty and the crust too be way too chewy. I tried this after getting tired of having to travel so far for the best authentic Italian Pizza and desserts at Alino Pizzeria in Mooreseville. It turns out Alino still takes the cake.  Inizio has a nice set up with great indoor and outdoor seating.  Service is good as well, just not impressed with the pizza or the cannoli."}
{"text":"Authentic Italian pizza. Food was delicious. Great causual vibe and excellent service."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Inizio for an early weekday lunch. After hearing such great reviews, my expectations were high. I was not disappointed. We ordered a large pistachio to split. Within 5 mins we were enjoying this wonderful pie. Thin but not too crispy crust, flavorful pistachio pesto that wasn't overpowering, and the best part they put is a cup of their delicious sauce on the side for crust dipping. Interesting atmosphere, large shared picnic style tables, with exposed structures and open storage. I would go back any time. However it does get busy, so get there early."}
{"text":"First time at Inizio did not disappoint! I've been wanting to get down here, especially since I heard about the pumpkin pizza. The pumpkin pizza is very balanced. I actually wish there was more pumpkin flavor to it but I'm sure they tone it down for others palates. It's very good and I love it with a little marinara sauce. Service is great, and pizza is timely. You can order ahead online but not by phone. We also tried the pumpkin cannoli, and it was delicious. Highly recommend it. Pumpkin cream in the middle and white chocolate chips on the ends. Love their patio outside, which is dog friendly. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Best pizza crust in town. Wish they would do half toppings or have more size options."}
{"text":"This place is special. From the very attentive staff (that actually cares) to the pizza itself, which is absolutely amazing.   I recommend the Margherita with pepperoni - simple yet one of the best foods I've ever eaten.  Looking forward to the Dilworth location so we don't have to drive so far. :)"}
{"text":"The best executed Napoletana pizza in South Charlotte.  Not my favorite of all time, but sometimes you've got to love the one you're with.  Inizio makes loveable pizzas."}
{"text":"Inzio is some amazing pizza! The dough is the best part. Every time that I go, I get a different pizza and it is always good. Their toppings are fresh with a lot of non sauce and sauce options for pies. They have a good beer selection. The cannolis and gelato are both amazing. Just make sure to save room for dessert! The service is excellent and all pizzas come out piping hot. No surprise that this place is so popular! Bravo"}
{"text":"I am a longtime fan of the original Inzios location. I was excited to see this one open in Dilworth but was nervous because sometimes new locations aren't as good. This is so not the case! The location is huge with ample seating inside and outside. Decor is a little trendier than the other location. Service was just as excellent. The pizza and dough were amazing. Got a cannoli and it was so good! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Had a pizza craving but I didn't want some boring chain. Inizio poped up top of the list in the area. So glad I stopped in. Very distinct pizza. Delicious and not nauseating like a lot of pizza. Wood fired so comes out fast and fresh. The pistachio pesto was amazing! I love the cheese and sauce they use. I had another kind with sweet sausage and heavingly little tomatoes. I will definitely be coming back. I didn't try their Gelato but it looked good."}
{"text":"I had dinner here with my 3 year old and 8 month old this evening. The food was absolutely delicious and the customer service was just as delightful as the food. We will definitely go back. Please check this place out!"}
{"text":"Pizza was not bad. But the  price for the pie was overpriced. $20 for a 12 inch price"}
{"text":"Very unique pizza place. The gelato section is great. Got the margarita pizza. Came with extra sauce"}
{"text":"Coming back from Europe I didn't expect to love a pizza the way I did in Naples. But this pizza is no joke. The flavors, fresh ingredients and the different styles of pizza will have me coming back forever. Inizio is one of my favorite restaurants in town."}
{"text":"Delicious. If you haven't had Napoletana style pizza you are missing out. This place is legit and I give it five stars for quality, taste, customer service and ambiance. We had a basic pizza margherita and the arugula salad. I'd order both again. The sauce is solid (and I'm Italian and picky about the sauce). :) The pizza is large and sharable, just something to keep in mind. Come hungry folks. And leave room for a cannoli, they're made to order."}
{"text":"Memories of Italy and they were good memories!  Great food, service, and ambiance especially al fresco dining! Got the pizza Maria, wine, San peligrino, and cannoli and talked for a while without pressure to leave."}
{"text":"I just walked out of this place and don't think I will return. My pizza was so soggy and saturated I could barely stomach it. Very disappointed. WAY OVER PRICED for what you get."}
{"text":"2nd time going to this place and they are out of DOUGH to make pizza. Went there once and liked the pizza but will NEVER go back. How does a pizza restaurant not have dough???? I'm done!"}
{"text":"Inizio is a taste of Italy! Absolutely delicious Neapolitan pizza. I haven't had pizza this good since I was in Florence. Great service and amazing food! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Talk about an amazing pizza....pistachio pesto is my go to. Cooked on a 900 degree deck in under 6 minutes. Always amazing. Always"}
{"text":"I travel to Naples, Italy at least once a year and this is hands down the closest to an authentic Napoletana pizza I have had in the states.  All I can say is:  well done!  You have nailed it!  Edit:  I looked at the other reviews.  For any who provided a negative review, either they  don't understand authentic pizza or they are commenting on the cost.  Yes, it is pricey, but you cannot experience this in any typical American pizzeria.  In Naples, you can get a similar pizza for 6-8 euros and a 1/2 liter of wine for 7 euros but we are not in Italy.  If you want the true experience without the  $1500 round trip ticket, try Inizios, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that maybe   I'm just not a fan of Napoletana style pizza. I've never been to Italy to have the real thing but I have travelled the US eating at the top pizza restaurants.  And I used to work for a pizza manufacturer developing products. Overall my experience was good.  I was greeted by a friendly order taker and the rest of the staff was just as friendly.  After ordering a couple of pies,  I sat overlooking the dining room to notice that it is all picnic bench style of seating.   My pies arrived served on a sheet pan, unusual but it works.  Only if they would warm them up to keep the product hotter. I had their mushroom pizza and their meat and picante pepper pies.  The exterior crust was chewy but did not have much of the character I was hoping for from a 900F oven. Not much mallard reaction going on here. Now the reason I'm not a fan; the remainder of the pizza is so thin that it cannot support the topping ingredients. The  mushrooms were  flavorless and the meats glistened with moisture, soaking the crust.  Actually, the dough was not allowed to cook.  The texture was lifeless and the flavor bland.   I did order 12 inch pies and the 16 inch looked a bit better on others tables so I may try this restaurant one more time."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointing experience. The restaurant is nice overall but what I saw go on made it to where I will likely never go back.   They advertise fresh ingredients straight from Italy. I guess Italy means the Food Lion next door. As I'm sitting and waiting on my Raffaele pizza to be made with Buffalo Mozzarella, I watch an employee walk in with a bag from food lion. They then proceed to add 5 packs of Kraft shredded mozzarella to the bin while laughing (I wish I could add video here but the photos should work).   I then receive a very mediocre pizza after 20 minutes, clearly covered in the shredded cheese rather than fresh mozzarella. For $15, I felt ripped off. I mean at least if you are going to try to pass off packaged cheese as fresh, don't add it in while laughing in clear view of customers.   To top it off, as I'm leaving, I look back to the prep area to watch another employee spraying glass cleaner on a rag, over the top of a prepped pizza, and overspraying the entire prep surface in order to clean the glass on the case above it. I feel bad for the customers who had to eat the glass cleaner on their pizza as well as any customers who then had their dough rolled out in glass cleaner.   For the price, I would expect a lot more out of this. If an ingredient is out, either bring it up to the customer and apologize while offering a refund or replacement, or purchase a comparable ingredient rather than the cheapest you can find at the grocery store. Teach employees proper methods for handling cleaning chemicals around food prep areas and raw/prepped food. It was a true disappointment and I will likely not be back because of it."}
{"text":"It's like being teleported to Italy.  The crust on the pizzas is just fantastic--a little crispy and nice and chewy. Toppings are authentic:  buffalo mozzarella, spicy salami, Calabrian peppers. And the sauce is fresh, sweet and bursting with flavor. Best pizza in Charlotte!  Hands down!  Oh and the cannoli is outstanding, too!"}
{"text":"You know you find a good place to eat when there's a line out the door and a smile on everyone's face in line. My husband and I are new to the area and we're craving some wood fired pizza. We found Inizio on Yelp, saw the fantastic reviews, and had to give it a try!   We had a margarita pizza and a pistachio Pizza and oh boy, it was amazing! The pistachio Pizza sounded like it would be an odd combination, but it turns out it's the best invention ever!   The staff was kind and prompt with service. John came to our table and asked how we were liking the pizza and of course we told him it was amazing and it hit the spot! He thanked us and left after chatting with us a bit. He later came back to the table and welcomed us to the area with two cannolis! One chocolate chip and one pumpkin. Both of which were to die for!  Thank you John and the staff at Inizio! We had a great experience and look forward to returning!"}
{"text":"So my favorite pizza that is not New York or Chicago is Antico in Atlanta, which could be my only comparison. I was going to eat a slice and write my review but this pizza was SO good I had to eat half my pizza first.   I don't typically compare other types of pizzas but in ATL, Antico wins, in the Bay Area, Zachary's (Chicago style) wins. In Charlotte, Inizio wins.   Ordering a 12\" Raffaele, I took my first bite and immediately was hit with the sweet pepper contrasting to a tomato sauce that had balanced acidity. Next bite had sausage with a hint of spice, enough heat right next to the crunch of the onion. The crust light yet toasted.   Washed down with a crisp Orange Sanpellegrino, and I was a happy camper. Variety of gelato but I went with the Cannoli, stuffed to order. The ricotta, vanilla, nutmeg center is fresh and AMAZING.   Guess I'll have to head home and recaffeinate with some Forte Legato Coffee, as this is an experience that could put you to sleep, warm and content."}
{"text":"This was our third visit to Inizio Pizza Napoletana and it was time for a review. Any startup bumps, experienced on earlier visits, are gone and this Teams has its \"sauce\" together.   We started our meal with a shared Italian Chopped salad. Quality blend of flavorful greens (no iceberg) including arugula, cherry tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, basil and a tasty Balsamic Glaze. A great start to any meal or a meal all by itself.  We decided on 2 pies (small) to satisfy our differing tastebuds. My Bride ordered the Margherita DOB. A perfect blend of quality ingredients starting with a San Marzano tomato sauce, buffalo mozzarella, basil, garlic and she added pepperoni. All good......all gone!  I ordered the Pizza Raffaele; the same delicious sauce & fresh mozzarella, sweet peppers, sausage and garlic.  An absolute flavor explosion with each bite especially if you dip the crispy crust into the same quality tomato sauce which is also served as a side.  All good...all gone!  Expect a bit of char as the ovens are actual wood burning not the gas variety you can find elsewhere. But quality ingredients and a quality product comes at a price... but it's worth it!  PS: the Team is friendly, helpful and followup on their work by stopping by and asking about your meal....more than once!"}
{"text":"The interior was really cool, the wood and metal made for some nice ambiance.  The pizza is okay, they're going for the authentic Sicilian thing, but I wasn't a huge fan. The pizza seemed undercooked and soggy.  We were told that you couldn't remove toppings that you didn't care for from the pizza.  That was odd, I understand not wanting to substitute toppings, but why can't you leave them off??  Also, no one waits on you here.  You stand in line to order, then get your own everything, and someone will bring your pizza out.  It's set up the same way at True Pizza, but at a lower price point."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Pizza in a very long time.  There is really good pizza in the area, nothing is close to this.  The pepperoni will be a surprise!   Outdoor seating is available family style. Indoor seating is in full view of the pizza ovens.  Smiles greeted me from the first step inside."}
{"text":"Best pie in the city. I have been to almost all of the pizza places that make it right, this place is the best yet. Pepperoni is not for the timid.  1000 degree pizza ovens! Fresh ingredients great atmosphere friendly staff, most delicious pie!!!"}
{"text":"Drove 40 minutes with a friend to try this place out so I had VERY high expectations, and they were met! There are so many options but I came here for the infamous Green Pistachio Pizza. My friend and I LOVED IT! I love the whole setup where you can go get whatever extra stuff you want like red pepper flakes or more cheese. I love that they have like cucumber water and stuff like that, it's perfect! The girl greeted us and explained the menu to us when we first came in. The staff was super friendly, which keeps the vibes of the whole place more upbeat. I want to come back and try the cannoli as well!"}
{"text":"I've tried many pizza places in the Charlotte area and this is hands down the best.  There's people who have tried to duplicate this but they only come marginally close.  I love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Great spot for pizza, salad, local craft beer &/or a glass of wine with family & friends. Pizzas have top flight ingredients and are made in a wood fired oven (quickly too). Salads are fresh, tasty, & beautiful. Team is efficient & friendly. Chef shared his passion for the ingredients, the process, & patrons. Sit inside or out...you'll enjoy!"}
{"text":"Have been searching for a Neapolitan place for sometime now and lucky for me ,we have one close by now. Loved it."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza place in Charlotte! Delicious pizza, salads and gelato! Wonderful service and trendy ambiance!"}
{"text":"I don't usually write bad reviews, but when you go twice to a place to have dinner and they don't have dough to make pizza and it's a pizza restaurant, i just have to make other people aware.  It's the second time that we went to Inizio's Restaurant in less than a month at 6:40 pm and they are out of dough. You're not reading it wrong...A pizza place that runs out of dough before 7:00 pm. The pizza might be good, if you are lucky enough to get there in time before they run out of dough.  I'm sorry but there are a lot of good places in Charlotte for me to give this place another chance. For me it's poor management. It's not worth the time or frustration!"}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza here because friends recommended it. When I tasted mine the crust was soft and chewy.  Disappointed because of the oven they use. Another friend had a similar experience. When I called them to let them know and explain it was better when I reheated it on a pizza stone in my oven and they may want to consider cooking longer than 90 seconds they blew me off. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Terrible ethics and customer service! Went there once before and the food was decent. Tried to get some food from them tonight and I call them asking to place a to-go order, first thing they say is, based on the inconvenience this places we no longer accept over the phone orders, but you can place it on our website or come in person. I tell the staff that I can understand that but am in their parking lot trying to put my baby to sleep. \"Oh ok, but we still can't accept a to-go order over the phone.\" Their loss, I went across the street to the other pizza place and got our food. What they didn't know is we were wanting to place a larger catering order this coming weekend, well, guess who isn't getting that business... ! If you going to have a pizza place, may want to learn some manners and customer service ;). The world doesn't revolve around your poor ethics and lack of want to accommodate customers."}
{"text":"This is authentic Italian pizza made in Italian pizza ovens. Very very tasty. Good wines, salads and Italian water. They had gelato but never thought about it again after dinner. There are picnic tables outside for those that like outside dining"}
{"text":"Super fast pizza is being served at Inizio!  I stopped by for a late lunch, placed my order for the Raffaele(sausage, peppers, onions, and mozzarella), got my drink and grabbed a community table and before I could get comfortable, the pizza was being placed in front of me....now that is service and pretty darn good pizza too!"}
{"text":"Pros, beautiful atmosphere, the pizza cooks fast, the TASTE is a total foodgasm in your mouth and Tastes like a traditional neopolitana pizza from ny! Great service, friendly, considerate   HOWEVER...cons,  there was more surrounding crust than actual pizza as a whole, the main pizza crust with all of the neopolitana ingredients on it was sooooooo this ot was slimy and limp.  It leaves you less full than a traditional pizza and I would say because of this the 16 inch is only good for 2 people who like surrounding crust because if you do not eat any of the surrounding crust you will starve!  So in the end, will this be my go to to get filling pizza frequently? NO  BUT it will be my go to when I'm craving the \"TASTE\" of home"}
{"text":"This is a no brainer giving this place 5 stars. So amazing!! Best pizza in Charlotte and we have literally been to all of them!"}
{"text":"YUM!!! this was a great experience! Our pizza was delicious- 4 of us split two pizzas - the margherita and the capricciossa and two bottles of wine. It was a bit pricey-$100 total but the pizza was delicious.   The crust was yummy and the marinara sauce to dip in was great. I love that they have all sorts of options to go with you pizza to bring to your table - olive oil, red pepper, cheese etc. after dinner we loved the gelato - the salted caramel was a favorite for our group. The service was very attentive and friendly!   Definitely recommend for a fun weeknight (we went on a Wednesday) the decor was also cute and we enjoyed sitting outside!  Yum!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza. Can't say enough good things about it. My girlfriend is gluten free but with the flour they use she can still eat it. I love the char on the crust...it reminds me of being in Italy!"}
{"text":"WONDERFUL! Great pizza, great environment. Perfect for families, adults or just a quick bite. They have a decent beer selection and man was the pizza delicious. We had the margarita and the pistachio. The staff is great, they are very proactive about coming to check on you, clearing your table and even asking if you want another beer, which is great considering it is a \"order at the register and take your number\" place.  We will definitely be back! Be careful walking in, the entrance to the restaurant is right by the entrance to the shopping center and people come FLYING in."}
{"text":"Great spot! Pistachio pizza was DELICIOUS. Pizza is done QUICK people! Although you order at the counter and get a number for your table, the wait staff is great about checking in on you to see if you need anything, bringing you a box etc. Nice casual atmosphere, great for families or just a quick bite.   We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"\"You NEVER eat the crust! You want mine too?\"- hubby says after I inhaled my four slices in literally like 5 minutes... Okay I took my time eating the last two slices. Slowly savoring each bite. Carefully dipping my crusty pizza crust sticks in the obviously homemade marinara sauce. (Nice touch)   Aight... I didn't go there, so I can't comment on the service or what the place even looks like. My dude picked up the pie... After complaining for at least 2 minutes on how expensive the pizza would be. I mean I get we're on a budget but every now and then you want something good. And if we're gonna get pizza... Just once I'd like to take a break from papa Johns. I mean they ain't all that. They're just a filler food.   But this! Inizio.... Oooooh you just gained one more fan.   Our pie had sweet peppers that complemented the saltiness of the meat. And the mozzarella (brings fingers to mouth for a kiss) perfection! I'm a cheese connoisseur and they did that!   Yes! 1000 times yes I will be back... Well I didn't go there myself... But yea whether I go or my dude picks up... We in there!"}
{"text":"I stumbled into Inizio around 10 pm on a Saturday night after a long day of apartment hunting and fun around Charlotte. The boy taking orders at the counter was quiet and pretty rude. After a short wait, I was able to get my pizza and leave. After a 5 minute drive back to my Airbnb,   my pizza became soggy and lousy. Was really hoping this place would be a hit since the ambiance was super cool but quite frankly I was disappointed. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Good pizza and fabulous customer service.  We had dinner here on a Friday night.  We got there at 5:30 and it was already busy.  That's a good sign but unfortunately since it is so popular we felt like we couldn't leisurely eat our pizza with people standing waiting for a table.    We ordered a margarita pizza with mushrooms, one Pinot Grigio, one beer and one sparkling water.  Total of $48 which included a 20% tip.  Not crazy expensive but also not cheap if that's what you are looking for.  The pizza tasted like everything was super fresh and of really high quality so I think it's definitely worth the price.  Asking for a tip when you wait in line to order and then get your own utensils, plates, etc seems kind of weird to me but since you are prompted I gave them 20% even though I had no idea how the service would be.   Not a big deal, just a little strange.    Right after our pizza came out one of the managers (maybe owner?) came over and asked if we liked cannoli's.  Of course we said yes, who doesn't like cannoli's!?  Anyway, he said he wanted to give us a free cannoli because he saw our pizza come out and it was smaller than he likes them to be.  So needless to say, we were pretty impressed with their customer service.  For what it's worth, it was a bit smaller than the other pizzas that we saw but was still plenty of food for two people.   We wrapped the cannoli and had it later that night.  Holy amazing.   It was exactly how I like my cannoli, not too sweet.   As other reviewers have noted, it's a specific Neopolitan style of pizza and you have to like that style.  Even though it's not my favorite style, it was still pretty delicious and as noted earlier, super fresh with high quality ingredients. It would be hard to get me to stray from my regular favorite pizza place, True Crafted but we will probably be back when we feel like something different."}
{"text":"If you've been to Naples and eaten a traditional margherita pizza - your tastebuds will soar back to a true Italian experience at Inizio. Spectacular ingredients and perfectly charred crust. The san marzano tomato sauce is insanely good. I really appreciated the cup served on the side for dipping my final bites of crust. Also the olive oil on the condiment bar was top notch as well...also nice for crust dipping.  Their margherita carries the DOP Italian authenticity mark of approval! Def start here on the menu as it is exactly how the Italians do pizza! The pecorino cheese sprinkled on top was perfection. In my opinion - no need for any other toppings! At first I thought the price was a bit much ($18) for a traditional margherita - even in the expense capital of America in the middle of Hollywood - they are usually $10-12. THEN I was told that they have 2 sizes. A 16 in pizza is $18 and the smaller traditional size of 12 in is $12...right in line w all my experience! So if you bring a friend- by all means get the larger size - otherwise I would get the 12 in to indulge in on my own.  Lots of other reviews mention the higher price point - but when you recognize the high level of quality ingredients used in each pie - they are right in line. You definitely get what you pay for! You can't compare other pizzas that have low quality ingredients or any other traditional American pizza w this place. Come and taste a true ITALIAN way of cooking and tasting.  Your tastebuds will thank you."}
{"text":"Not as good as the original location. Either the oven or the pizza maker was off today...more black spots on the crust than usual. Had to ask for the small red peppers that usually have out. Would wait a bit to go back to see if the kind are worked out."}
{"text":"Good pizza! Not Brooklyn but definitely coming back! Sauce taste good service great and friendly! A nice thin crust and cozy atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I had been waiting to try this pizza for some time. My husband is a super picky eater though. I was disappointed that they limit substitutions and won't do half and half pizzas. I liked the atmosphere a lot but I got it as take out. I live really close but it got cold before I could eat it which was weird. Other than that I loved it. The flavor was great and the crust was perfect. I'll probably go back and just eat there. Plus they have beer."}
{"text":"The pizza ingredients are all very tasty; however the pie itself can be a floppy mess when you lift a slice. I'm all about some quick wood-fired pizza but it seems like they're not able to get a firm base/crust underneath which leads to everything sliding off. I don't know if soggy is the right term but they need to figure out how to get a more stable crust underneath to keep all those toppings in place!   That being said, the service was excellent, pizza tasted great, and the atmosphere can't be beat!"}
{"text":"Just about 5 star perfection. Awesome pizza and service.  Fair beer and wine selection and offerings. Love the gelato. And fast service too."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. I'd like to say their pizza is of good quality and taste. I just don't know if it's worth the price. What am I saying, of course it is! Each pizza is cooked to perfection and so so yummy! I'm really looking forward to going again a soon. I need to try more of their stuff!! Now you, go! You won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Wish they had more topping options and would let you customize or at least split half and half, but that margherita is everything!"}
{"text":"Delicious fresh pizza with very nice yeasty dough (thin on the bottom, thicker on the ends).  Little expensive - one pizza could feed 2 but at $20 a pop. Best thing is the staff - super friendly and helpful.  Good ambiance"}
{"text":"Decent. Overpriced, but the speed justifies the price I suppose. Unique restaurant concept with creative pizza choices that are cooked unbelievably fast. I definitely prefer Kenna, that's just across the street. Better pizza, MUCH better beer, and Kenna's wings are splendid."}
{"text":"Seriously delicious pizza. Simple ingredients, well executed.   You can order online which is a plus but you can't time your order and they don't text or call with an ETA.   We loved the pistachio pesto. Get that. Open mouth and enjoy.    Most of the employees seem pretty new and still getting acclimated. Be patient with them but they could go also move a little faster or tell folks waiting in line hello and that you'll be right with them."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Charlotte! Can't get enough of the dough! Raffaelle is my favorite and Diavola for the spiciness!"}
{"text":"Friends have raved about this place so I went.  We had the sausage pizza with tomatoes cheese and onion.  The onion was sliced wide, thick and barely cooked.  I like onion but this was not good.  The tomatoes were small cherry like tomatoes and were the shining star of the whole experience.   My sister compared the pizza crust to naan, which I love but not as a pizza crust.  It was soft and chewy and made for a very floppy experience, a poor base for the toppings.  There were black oven burn marks in places that made me hopeful that the next bite would be firmer but no.  If this is authentic Neapolitan pizza fine but I guess I am not a fan! I am glad I didn't stop and get this to take to my parents', they would have hated it.  They have fresh garlic and tiny peppers in little containers that you can put on your pizza.  The peppers were great but very hot.  I really hated that I had to get a bottled soft drink.  They only offer, besides wine, bottled beverages.  I want ice in my drink.  I'm glad I killed a lemming but I will definitely not be back. 2 stars bc it was clean the people were nice and obviously other people liked it."}
{"text":"Place is great. The food is excellent and the wait staff is just the nicest. It is a place you order at the counter but you will want to leave a tip bc the servers do a lot for you. Wife and I couldn't be more pleased with our experience. Tip of the cap to the owner and all the workers"}
{"text":"Pizza delicious my husband we would like to come back again and recommend it for real pizza real fresh."}
{"text":"My gf and I went with few friends only one time and it was one time too much.. just.. oily and fatty.. pizza for me is a comforting food and here it wasn't.. service was great so maybe I'll give it one more chance.."}
{"text":"Salad was great. Pizza on the other hand was nothing like Italy. They may bring in the water and use 00 flour, but an Italian pie it is not. Sauce was to runny and sparse. The bread had no real crunch and was a bit chewy. Nothing like you will find in any area of Italy I have been. The guys at Portofina from Naples make a better pie. The salad her however was superior.   For the price, a pizza place should have decent pizza."}
{"text":"This local pizza parlour is everything the excellent reviews say it is. The Tuesday evening that my family of four was there was jam-packed with diners; in fact, we had to wait 10 minutes for half a community table to open up.  We split a large margarita style pizza for $18 and a Caprese salad $10. The pizza was as delicious as reported  but the salad was just average and pretty small for the money.  Overall experience is pretty chaotic and if you want a more relaxing environment you may want to try it off hours. They did offer some excellent specials including half-off wine bottles on Tuesdays and $3 draft on Wednesdays. They also offer a tasty gelato at a reasonable price and on special for $2 on Thursdays. I would rate this place a Gotta Try but not at dinner time."}
{"text":"Spectacular service. We're working through the menu and every thing has been excellent. Pizza, salad, desserts, even the pizza condiments are superb. Great tap beer & super fast cook times. This place rivals some of the best NYC pizza I've had (Keste, Artichoke, DiFara, Motorino, Patsy's of Harlem).  Pizza snobs who are serious about the ingredient quality will LOVE this place!  Update: this place is now in our regular rotation.  Post mates delivers for them, so this place will always get our very regular patronage."}
{"text":"We were apprehensive at first because in the past we have been to similar \"90 sec 900 degree\" pizza things and either end up with a pie that is burnt to a crisp or still dough on the bottom. But the yelp pictures looked so good we had to try. We were super happy we did! This place has their baking down, at least with our pizza. We got the raefaella without sausage in large with an arugula salad and had an absolute feast. They had a very pleasant well lit patio and lots of good seating for large groups. It would be a fun place to have a game night or something."}
{"text":"Unquestionably the best pizza in Charlotte, and their customer service is even better!!! There was a mix up with our order and the manager was incredible. He was kind enough to remake our order, give us the mistakenly made pizza free (pistachio...which ended up being our favorite pizza anyway), and gave us two cannoli's.  We will definitely be return customers and I highly recommend this place to anyone who is looking for authentic Italian wood fire pizza!!! Great pizza and  incredible service!"}
{"text":"As a New Yorker moving to the south I got concerned about not finding good pizza, well this place has it. They use real wood burning ovens, takes a whole 90 seconds and the pizza is ready. The Margherita is fantastic. The staff is extremely friendly, Nae, was very friendly and gave us good recommendations for things to try the next time we come. Keep up the good work inizios."}
{"text":"This is a good pizza spot. I tried the margarita with pepperoni.  Pizza is pretty thin with thick crust. Small size could possibly feed 2. Pizza comes on a big tray! Very cheesy! Best let is the pepperoni! They are shaped like bacon slices!"}
{"text":"This is the thing - this really isn't pizza. Let me explain, if you are comparing it to the chains or the pizza at the 4 corner gas station then this isn't THAT pizza. So when people bring up cost I think it misses the point. This is a meal - a good meal - a high end meal.  One of the benefits of being in a community where there is some density and wealth is that we get to have nicer things - one of those nicer things is Inizio pizza. It adds to the quality of one's life.   This is quality food. I've eaten at all the pizza places in the area. Many are \"wood fired\". Many are \"gourmet\". This is the only place that is wood fired but not burnt - it is both \"chewy\" and \"charred\" - a hard thing to get right.  I just had lunch there today - enjoyed every bite. I got a small Luigi to go, but I sat down in the restaraunt to have a piece before I got back in the car. I ended up eating the whole pizza in the restaurant. That's not to say the small is too small - it's just that it was that good and I'm a big fat pig.  Lastly, this is one of those places that makes me think of my dollars as votes - where I choose to spend my dollars is an opportunity to vote for what places I want to succeed. I gladly cast my vote for Inizio."}
{"text":"Great pizza spot! We ordered the Rafael and margarita pizzas, and we finished both pies in under 20 minutes...! The ingredients were super fresh, the crust was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. We loved the buffalo cheese on the Rafael, gave such a unique taste and smell to the pizza. They also have gelato and cannoli for dessert but we'll have to try next time-- too full this time. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"CRUST THE GOOD LORD.  I have to write more so it actually counts as a review, this friggin' pizza is soooo on point! I could honestly just eat an entire pizza's worth of the crust alone, but then they go on and put that sweet Italian magic all over it, hooooo boy.  Just go here. Staff is friendly, service is fast, pizza is bangin."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Charlotte. The only critique is a very limited selection of other items as they only serve pizza and salad. If you're in the mood for pizza though, this one is the one to go to."}
{"text":"Best pizza joint in South Charlotte. Pizza comes out quickly and is delicious. Must try the pistachio pizza. Good stuff. Try to get there early on a Friday because the place is usually packed."}
{"text":"The pizza is cooked in a large wood fire oven which makes the top of the pizza have a nice texture and leaves the bottom softer. I'm normally not a fan of softer crust however this is the one exception. The sauce was tasty and not sweet. Which is how I like it. I wasn't a fan of the gelato. It was more like an ice cream texture and the flavors weren't anything new special (chocolate chip and also the lemon were the only ones I tried)"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Charlotte! I was thrilled to have finally found a pizza place that doesn't drown their pies in grease. Crust is always nice and crunchy!"}
{"text":"It was packed tonight. Had a simple margherita pizza with mushrooms and it was fabulous. Definitely a new favorite!"}
{"text":"Inizio Pizza is the \"da Michele\" of Charlotte. And if you know about pizza, you know this is crazy good."}
{"text":"Finally got to try the pizza that has been the apple of my Instagram eye since they opened! I had to go with the infamous pistachio pesto pizza and was not disappointed. I loved the combo of fresh ricotta with the mozzarella. The pesto was garlicky and accented by a lovely crunch from the pistachios. What really makes the pizza is the crust, soft, chewy, fluffy with a floral olive oil flavor and a nicely subtle crunch from the oven. If you don't like eating the crust of your pizza don't go to Inizio because that would be a sad, sad waste of seriously the best part of this pizza. I loved the long wooden tables, abundance of red pepper flakes, the dessert case with cheesecake and cannoli, and watching the pizza making process from the dough room to the 900 degree ovens. I was surprised to note that the location was in a plaza beside a grocery store but stepping inside you wouldn't know it. This is a great spot to go alone, for a date or a night out with friends or family. Great for anyone who likes good pizza!"}
{"text":"We just moved to Charlotte from the West Coast, and I am a huge pizza snob. When I discovered Inzio, I was very excited to try it. My daughter and I went for dinner, ordered a capricciosa and pistachio pizza, anda seasonal cannoli (peppermint mocha).   The food is fantastic. The pizza is well done, cooked in a 900° wood-burning oven. The crust is thin and soft just as an authentic Neapolitan style pizza should be.   My only complaint is that it is extremely loud within the restaurant. I am not an old fuddy-duddy, I used to live in Las Vegas the city of sounds and lights, however I was finding myself at full anxiety level sitting within Inzio's walls.   Here's the problem, the restaurant has community tables. While I am not opposed to the seating arrangement, having found that it worked well at places like the OMB brewery, at this pizza place it simply does not work.   Tables of misbehaving children are screaming, throwing pizza dough, kicking other customers in the back who are seated behind them, in short...it is a nightmare dining experience.  My daughter and I ate half of our pizzas and got the rest to go, feeling that it would be much better for us to take a cold pizza home and eat it there then it would be to indoor any further torture while being seated at this pizzeria.  I'll definitely go back for the food, but will take it to go."}
{"text":"Inizio is hands down my favorite pizza place in Charlotte. I've tried quite a few spots and none comes close to being as good. When I'm looking for quality I always go here. When I'm looking for something greasier and more chain like I go elsewhere. I'm very glad they opened their Dilworth location as we had quite a far drive going down to the original Providence location.  Both locations are usually busy, but you can always find a seat even if you have to share a table with another party.   The pizzas are simple and well executed. They are made of special very fine flour and baked quickly in a very hot oven. Because they're so thin they're done in minutes and make it to your table quite quickly. We love the bianca and pistachio pizzas. I'm a big meat lover when it comes to pizza, but these are great with or without. They don't typically come with sauce on the pizza, but instead have a cup of red sauce on the side for dipping if you wish. We ask for an extra cup upfront which is enough for the two of us. We always get some of the fresh roasted garlic from the condiments area as well to load onto our pizza.   They have local beers on tap and serve gelato as well. We've had the gelato once and it was good, but nothing extremely exciting.   I'll alway consider Inizio my go-to pizza in Charlotte. I've never had one I didn't like and will keep going back time and again!"}
{"text":"Tried the basic Margherita pie; it is a small 16 inches (only one size available), and is, by design, millimeters thin at the center (the dough is pressed/tossed far too thin to hold even sauce and cheese never mind any additional toppings or flavor). The crust is ok. Yes, the pizza is \"different\" than anything else you can really get in Charlotte and the craft is respectable. But, the pizza is just not impressive and it costs a truly unbelievable $18. For a pizza that you order at a counter (and are prompted to add a tip before you eat), and by their own suggestion is barely enough to feed one adult man. So your looking at potentially $18 per person minimum and you eat off paper plates at community tables. This is just insanely overpriced; maybe if the pizza was $12 I'd have a different feel but the pizza's not great, the place was overhyped by Charlotte Agenda, and is a terrible value to boot. Staff is extremely nice, but I definitely won't be back. (Removed any references to other [better] derivative styles of Neapolitan pizza because people take Yelp reviews super cereal)."}
{"text":"This is an excellent place to go for lunch! Absolutely delicious pizza ready in 90 seconds. You're in and out fast because the pizza is ready in just a few minutes. If you're looking for a place to sit down with a date with some privacy this isn't the place to go. Picnic style tables so you will be sitting with other people. Also, be ready to drop some money here. However, you get what you pay for. I've been here at least twenty five times and the food is always on the money! Consistent every single time."}
{"text":"Great customer service. Philecia helped us out and she was so nice and recommended us what was best on the menu, highly recommend going and having her as your order taker."}
{"text":"Great pizza - nice atmosphere.  Used to come here all the time when Wolfman pizza was here so I was glad when another pizza place finally opened again here. This is different pizza than wolfman but really good.  More fresh ingredients, great salads bright light atmosphere.  Infused water for free and olive oil cornbread dipping.   Large long picnic style tables for dining.  Didn't try the gelato but it looked great, along with small craft beef and wine selection.  Staff was attentive and friendly.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"This pizza is fabulous! Quick and delish for takeout or dine in! One of our favorites in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Passable but not better. We tried the \"Margherita\" and the Pistachio - $33 with a bottle of water. The crust was pretty good, and the mozzarella excellent but it ends there.   The so called Margarita tasted OK, but really bland. No fresh tomatoes just a tomato sauce which tasted exactly what it was : canned stewed tomatoes with little if any seasoning other than sugar. Secret ingredients [ rolls eyes ] right!  The only flavoring was a tiny leaf of basil on each slice.  The pistachio one was \"interesting\" but would I order it again: no. I found it more palatable with a heavy sprinkling of black pepper and grated parmesan to counter the oil.   I honestly don't know why so many rave about this place, iMO it's not even close to the hype."}
{"text":"Best pizza I have ever had!! The service was amazing and my kids loved watching the pizzas get made!  They are super authentic and the new little shopping Center they are located in is absolutely adorable.  I love the idea of communal tables.  We have met so many nice families here.  I really feel a sense of community and bringing the neighborhood together!"}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite place for pizza in Charlotte! Great restaurant and food. A MUST try for anyone looking for great pizza!!!"}
{"text":"Seriously the best pizza I have ever had. Some might disagree with this but between New York, Chicago and Italy the Pistachio Pizza here is actually the best pizza I have ever tasted. The flavor, crust, cheese, everything is perfection. I'm not sure I could ever go to another pizza place in Charlotte and not wish I was at Inizio. The aesthetic of the restaurant is also on point and I can't wait to go back and try the gelato!"}
{"text":"This place is very good, had the The Pistachio pizza and my daughter had the margarita pizza"}
{"text":"Had to check this place out. Right away I was taken back by the size of the pizza, they were really big. Not the traditional size I am accustomed to. Having said this they have their own take on their pizza and I had an enjoyable experience. The flavor was great but the crust was a little thick which may be due to size of the pizza. I would say overall it was great and I wouldn't hesitate to go back."}
{"text":"Want authentic Neapolitan pizza? They have the best in town unquestionably. The pistachio pizza is their staple and simply the must try on their menu. They give you a warm marinara dip which is a nice touch. Would recommend going with a partner or some friends and splitting a large pie."}
{"text":"Tired of all the California-style pizza with toppings thrown on a pre-made pie and barely cooked as your sliced is reheated? Know that chain delivery pizza has its place for cheaply feeding the masses but over the same old processed crap? Want something satisfying that doesn't say \"I'm hungover\" like the cheap, giant slices of fabulous cheese & pepperoni at Benny's?   Get to Inizio.   Take some friends. Take a date. Promise to share but wind up negotiating your slice trade deals like it's a hostage situation. Or just order another -- the pies take 90 seconds to cook in the Italian-imported, wood-fired ovens. But don't forget to save room for gelato and cannoli.   You'll spend some extra dollars at Incizio. Those dollars are worth it.   Can't wait for the 2nd location to open in Dilworth this spring."}
{"text":"I went to this place with my family after they kept telling me to go.  To be honest, I am not a huge fan of pizza, but this place served great pizza and used fresh ingredients.  We ordered a Maria (left) and Margherita(right).  The Margherita was good, but the Maria was delicious (could not stop myself from having multiple slices)!  My only criticism was that the crust was slightly burnt, but this is minor.  We also had a plain cannoli and a caprese salad (unfortunately was unable to get pictures), which were also good! As far as customer service it was exceptional.  The employees were friendly and the manager would go around to make sure everyone was enjoying their food.  The music and environment was good.   Definitely would recommend trying out this place and will visit again in the future!"}
{"text":"Perfect blend of cheese, dough and sauce. Exceptional cheese, tasty EVOO side, and wonderful spicy peppers. Perfectly cooked in a friendly atmosphere. Hubs and I had a great lunch out."}
{"text":"Follow up: I was contacted by both Grant, the owner, and Robert, the general manager, about my experience.  I gave them the details, and Grant assured me this would be addressed.  As I mentioned previously, the review addressed service issues--the pizza is great, and I will be trying them again.  Thanks for the quick response!"}
{"text":"Try the Pistachio pizza for something new that really works. While it can get a little noisy, the simple, clean, open urban loft type atmosphere is energetic and comfortable with a neighborhood feel. If the weather is nice try the outdoor patio.  Great staff, great eats, great space. Do not overlook the not-so-afterthought salads, some of which feature house made Mozzarella."}
{"text":"Great local pizza spot! Fresh dough and ingredients with innovative and delicious topping choices. They also provide house lemon water, ice water, minced garlic and their house pickled chilis to top your pizza.   Lemon gelato was incredible, zesty and naturally creamy. New york style cheesecake and housemade pumkpkin, chocolate chip, pistachio and white chocolate cannolis round out the delish offerings.  Staff was very friendly. Seating: open and modern bench style. Plenty of room to hunker down with some gooey, crusty, tomato goodness on a Sunday afternoon.  Prices are reasonable, $8 for a large arugala salad that we shared amongst 3. Pizzas are $14-22. Food delivered super quick from 900 degree pizza oven."}
{"text":"Good pizza. Some of the pizzas we got had a little too much salt for my liking. The crust was really good."}
{"text":"BAD pizza, GREAT cannolis. I am a cannoli connoisseur -- I am 75% Italian so I know my Italian dishes! These cannolis are definitely on my list of best in Charlotte next to Tonis Pizza's because the filling is on the more mild side of sweet. While the fillings consistency is not as smooth as the other cannolis I love in Charlotte, the lack of super sweetness, fresh shell and pistachio topping make this cannoli a real gem! The pizzas here on the other hand are always consistently soggy. It also is really unfortunate that you can't order ANYTHING to-go unless you're at the register -- no calling ahead is allowed, which means you have to wait and that's not conducive for someone who is on a time crunch."}
{"text":"As a relo from the NY/NJ area, and frequent IT visitor I am an admitted pie snob, and this place got my attention.  Inizio is not near my home but a mailer with great pictures, no discount coupon (a good sign for me) and an explanation of their no-substitute policy drew me in. Gotta love it! They let the food do the talking, and stay true to their authentic styles of pies.  Well done!      Best brick oven crust of the many places we have tried in the area, and for me that's 90% of the trick!  Not too thin or thick, and perfectly matched with the correct amount of toppings.  Young women working the order desk were well trained, knowledgeable, and pleasant.  We did take-out and the crust held up well to a re-heat on our pizza stone about an hour later.  This was our first visit, or I would have likely rated it 5 stars.  Will return and re-submit if favorable; likely very soon!"}
{"text":"3 stars for the experience, it's pretty cool having a pizza done in 90 seconds. However spending over bucks on 2 pies and a cannoli is a little too much for me. I've had better pizza for less but I guess you're paying for the experience."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and people working were young, probably in high school but dam everyone was so nice. I call it the \"Chik Fil A\" service!  The main front cashiers were very informative, if this is your first time here and eating Neapolitan pizza.  We got the classic margarita And it  is really really good, I mean this is what real pizza is about! All about simple but fresh ingredients.. the dough or crust is perfectly cooked with their brick oven pizza with a nice chew. The sauce was very light and perfect amount of tart to sweet ratio.  The cheese was very fresh, light, and salty.   Biggest issue: PRICE to portion ratio.   I understand fresh ingredients is not cheap however this is way over priced for the portion. Forget the individual portion you need their biggest size to be remotely full. However when you do one of their most cheapest which is the plain Margarita and just that with tip no drink after taxes are $22... now imagine if you got a drink and also had their pizza with toppings.. $25-28 for pizza....  I suggest they have a certain promotional night for their pizzas during one of their weekdays.  They do have them for like draft beer or $1 off gelato which Who cares about... but something like that with their pizza would be great, cause boy it is exxxxxxpensive for the portions!"}
{"text":"Recently dined here and ordered the margherita pizza with mushrooms- it was very good. Crust was also very good. Shared a cherry gelato for dessert which was excellent."}
{"text":"First off let me say that the pizza is delicious but that is where it stops.  No frills for certain.  Do not like the communal eating tables inside.  I feel like I am back at camp.  The outside is kinda dirty and not kept up very well at all.  The prices are out the roof.  We ordered a pizza, shared a big salad and 2 beers and it was over $40.  The pizza was not a large one either, no leftovers to even take home.  I will not be back for those reasons.  You can go to Hawthorne's or Mellow Mushroom and get much more for your money, tasty pizza, wait service and ambiance."}
{"text":"Just stopped in on a whim but was pleasantly surprised. A really cool atmosphere, 90 second pizza that was pure YUM. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Staff was real friendly with recommendations. Best pizza I've had in Charlotte. Big fan of the food fired oven that they use. Pizza tastes just like the ones in Italy. My son love the gelatos they have. My wife loves the cannolis. Only bad thing you can't call ahead but no big deal since the pizza tastes so good."}
{"text":"Great pizza, great atmosphere, great staff! We arrived just before dinner time but I could tell the place was filling up fast.   The staff were really friendly with my niece/nephew giving them bread dough to play with and showed them how to roll/throw a pizza in the air.   The food came out really quickly and they have multiple oils (including a really spicy red sauce) available by the pizza station. The only downside of the restaurant is they don't allow for addition or substitution of pizza toppings. Overall, would highly recommend for a good food/atmosphere pizza place."}
{"text":"Anxious to find good pizza in North Carolina I quickly bookmarked this place after reading some good reviews. I also noticed one of my favorite pizzas on their menu, the Pistachio Pizza!    It was easy to find and it's a nice roomy restaurant with plenty of seating indoor and outdoor. Their menu is rather small which isn't a bad thing, but their prices are on the high side. They also offer some salads and have some desserts like gelato and Cannoli's.    Of course we went with a small Pistachio Pizza 16$ which is typically the price of a large pie at any NY or Chicago pizza joint. The pizza wasn't horrible, but it was not a good combination. A real Pistachio Pizza comes with cream of Pistachio, fresh mozzarella, smoked provolone and crushed Pistachio. Adding Pesto to the pizza overwhelms everything on the pie making it a Pesto Pie not a pistachio pie. Not impressed.    I also noticed that they offer no daily specials on pizza which is very strange! They have daily specials on wine, beer & gelato, but somehow left out the pizza!   My search for good pizza in North Carolina continues! I won't return."}
{"text":"About our fifth visit tonight and pizza is very tasty and consistent.  Great creative and unique options like Pizza Blanco or Pistachio.  Toppings are fresh and crust is chewy with great flavor by itself.  Salads are generous and great to share.  If you're looking for traditional American pepperoni or sausage, this may not be your stop.  This place is an oasis in the Charlotte pizza wasteland and offers truly interesting gourmet options. Atmosphere is light industrial with fun family style tables and benches.  Location is an old Wolfman pizza place in a nondescript strip center but pretty easy to find and no problem with parking.  Server tonight was a little stoic but staff genuinely seems to like their jobs."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic pizza! A nice chewy crust and top notch ingredients. The pepperoni was not cheap prepackaged slices like you typically see but was rather shaved and delicious. Their Italian sausage was incredible. I did not have room for the gelato but I saw several customers who seemingly were very content with it. My only complaint is the pizzas are massive and there is only one size to buy. Awesome if you have a group that can agree on one or two to share. But it is going to be an undertaking for two people and needs to be some sort of eating competition for one person. But they are served fast thanks to the Naples Italy style of cooking them. Friendly staff too."}
{"text":"Not that great. Soggy crust. Toppings slid right off.  Very small beer selection.  Nice idea but needs work."}
{"text":"Finally had an afternoon off with my guy for us to be able to make our way down to try this place out. To say I was impressed wouldn't even do this place justice. This was definitely some of the best if not the best pizza and salad I have had in charlotte in a long time. To be completely honest the star of the show for me anyway was the caprese salad. To die for. I have no idea how they make the lemon vinaigrette that they used but I would do a lot of things to know how to make it. The combination of arugala and fresh basil leaves was genius and left me running to the store to buy these two ingredients to mix in with all my salads that I make at home. The ingredients they use are clearly authentic and amazingly fresh. We ordered the margherita pizza and it was hands down the best version of this pizza in town no questions asked. The buffalo mozzarella that they use is the best Ive ever tasted and the sauce is light and delicate and simply wonderful.  The crust is fresh delicious with the perfect chewy texture that's it meant to have and the fact that they create this pie in 90 seconds in a 900 degree oven is a wonder on its own.  The interior is very nice with wood paneling on the walls that I would love to do to the inside of my home. They have a small self service table with ice water plain and infused I liked the infused. Also with small portions of free add-ons for your pizza like peppers, garlic and other things.  The staff were super attentive and friendly and seemed to enjoy being there. I truly feel that everything was fairly priced especially given the high quality ingredients. I definitely want to say one thing though do not come here thinking you can order a pizza and it be a chain pizza place type experience you cannot come here and order a hamburger topped pizza and split it into 2 halves with different toppings its not that type of place and its even more amazing for this fact. This pizza is true to its style and its to die for.  Also word to the wise its whole pizzas so come with a friend or multiple people or come super hungry and expect to likely still have plenty of leftovers.  Save room for the gelato also its wonderful as well I loved it and I'm not even a sweets person. They also serve beer and wine and if I'm not mistaken they sell by the bottle and the glass both.  This place is how I would eat pizza every single time if I could and even given the drive ill be coming here as much as I can."}
{"text":"I try and go there once a week during lunch at work. My favorite pizza. Love the pistachio one. I'd request that as my last meal. Best thing I've ever eaten!!! If they can just get coke 0, totally would be sheer perfection"}
{"text":"Finally came here after meaning to try it for months, and Inizio's did not disappoint. Popped in around 6 on a Tuesday and it was actually pretty busy. We ordered the half-off bottle of wine and a pizza with sausage and pepperoni. I'm not usually a meat on pizza fan, but the hubs is pretty picky. Surprisingly the meat was delicious and you could tell all of the ingredients were high quality. The crust was delectable, and my crust-hating husband even ate it up. So exited to have this place so close, can't wait to try some veggie pizzas!"}
{"text":"Very authentic Napoletano style pizza!  I loved the flakiness and flavor of the crust as well as the fact that they import a lot of their ingredients.  Only thing I wasn't a fan of was the community tables.  Uncomfortable and felt like you are in a school cafeteria."}
{"text":"New go to pizza place! Delicious, fast and great environment. Nice patio and giant windows for cooler weather. Really like their authentic pizza styles and their gelato is top notch. Love to share an order of the Pistachio pizza and a chopped salad."}
{"text":"We love this place & it is now our go-to pizza joint. Wonderful selection of pies. Always perfectly prepared. We love their Margherita the best...simple but something authentic about this pizza! Yum!  Very good staff. Decent beer selection but not quite up to snuff."}
{"text":"I found this place looking at a Charlotte food IG page and thought it looked really good. My wife and I both decided we would try it, as we eat a lot of different types of pizza. We took my mom and my stepdad with us. When you walk in, it has a casual rustic vibe to it. The thing that kind of struck me as odd is that there is not a true make your own pizza. You have to get the Margherita Pizza and add some toppings to it.   The thing is, the toppings were not cheap at all. The pizza can get very expensive really quick. My mom and stepdad went that route and split a pizza. I did the same. My wife got one of the speciality pizzas. Another thing, you can't spilt toppings on half of the pizzas due to the type of cooking method they use.   I added pepperoni to my pizza and although it looked different and creative, it just tasted like pepperoni and I wasn't really blown away by the pizza in general. I think the worst part about this entire experience was that the 3 pizzas and 3 canned drinks (plus a tip) was $80. For a pizza place like that, I think that was overpriced.   The style of pizza and cooking methods did nothing for me and I don't think I will be returning. Maybe I was just overhyped from all of the pictures on their IG page or I don't really like this style of pizza. Either way, be prepared to over pay and be underwhelmed."}
{"text":"I really love Inizio Pizza Napoletana!!  They are located in Charlotte, NC, and are known for their Neapolitan style pizza (900 degree wood-fired oven with a 90 second bake).  Their dough is made with \"OO\" flour, San Marzano tomatoes, and real buffalo milk mozzarella (bufala Campana).  We tried the following: - Margherita Pizza - San Marzano Tomato Sauce, Buffalo Mozzarella, Basil, Garlic, Pecorino - Bianca Pizza - Buffalo Mozzarella, Fior Di Latte, Ricotta, Basil, Garlic, Pecorino - Raffaele Pizza - Sweet Pepper, Sausage, Roasted Onion, San Marzano Tomato Sauce, Buffalo Mozzarella, Garlic, Pecorino - Cavoletti Pizza - Brussel Sprouts, Pancetta, Fior De Latte, Pecorino, Buffalo Mozzarella  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!!   #MyHeartIsHappy #NeapolitanPizza #NomNomNom  ENJOY!!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is different.  Not uncommon, but not the pizza you think of such as papa johns,  i.e., heavier on toppings and cheese.  In short, it's a great example of a neapolitan style pizza.    The keys to me are the dough which is excellent (5/5), the fresh toppings, and the quick cook time of 90 seconds.  They use buffalos milk mozzarella  and marzano tomatoes which were amazingly good (5/5).  We went with the Raffaele, which has sweet peppers (which have a kick), and roasted onions.  We ordered the large and im kind of embarrassed to say my wife and I finished it all...it was that good (5/5).    Set up inside the restuarant is simple and there us ample bench style seating (5/5).  Just and excellent example of this style pizza that I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Wonderful Pizza the best I have ever had since my visit ti Italy, this guys know what they are doing. Great format of the restaurant and an incomparable atmosphere out of every concept you have known. Congratulations, we cam escaping  from hurricane Irma, Florida and found this wonderful place."}
{"text":"I hardly everrrrrr give 5 stars this place is incredible. The ingredients and dough are philnominal and alot of it is directly from Italy. We had the caesar and italian chopped salads and the caesar dressing is home made and tasty. The italian chopped salad meats and veggies r awesomeeeeeee. I will be here once a week."}
{"text":"It was time to start off our Memorial Day weekend and we decided it was Pizza, not BBQ, that was needed.  So, after a visit to a local brewery we headed east to Inizio just to see what all the hype was about.   Let's just say Inizio isn't just hype.  It's fantastic in every way.  From the minute you walk in the door you are greeted with smiles and exceptionally helpful staff members who offer advice, explain the pies, and even offer samples of ingredients. How cool.  Speaking of ingredients, one that jumped out at me was the Buffalo mozzarella. What what?  No, it isn't a wing sauce cheese. It's actually a cheese made from buffalo milk.  We sampled it and it had a nice texture with a slight sweetness. Score.  We ended up ordering the Capricciosa.  It included Artichoke, Prosciutto Ham, Mushroom, San Marzano Tomato Sauce, Buffalo Mozzarella...Yum. At 16\" it's a nice size for all the toppings you.    They make the pizza the Neapolitan-style.  Lots of fresh ingredients with less sauce and cheese than you find in the U.S. (I lived in Italy and love pizza there).    They use a wood-fired oven which slightly chars the crust. I like that a lot.  I think they could have charred it slightly more, but that was insignificant when you taste it.  Other items they offer include salads that feed four and cheesecake. I so wanted a slice, but held off.   They also have a nice selection of craft beer, including OMB, Birdsong, Triple C, NODA.  They also have Peroni Beer on tap if you want the full Italian experience.    The atmosphere is very inviting.  Every seat in the house is good.  You can watch your pizza being made even from the farthest corners of the restaurant.    I'll say it again, the staff was friendly, fun, and efficient. The pizza was great and gave me and my wife enough leftovers to take home.  Awesome all the way around."}
{"text":"Still love this place! Yes, they are a bit pricey but the servings are huge (we always have leftovers) and the quality is excellent. The Pistacchio, made with pistachio pesto, and the Diavola with Spicy Salami, Calabrian Peppers and Buffalo Mozzarella are our favorites! Only three minutes in the oven, one to cool at the table and three minutes into my belly (all while never letting go of the Higher Ground Draught in my left hand)!  Specials rotate - sometimes it's $3.50 craft beers (Weds I think) and Thursdays are $2 small gelatos. The Salted Caramel is \"to die for\" and the Amarena Cherry is crazy good!"}
{"text":"I had heard great things about this place so decided to give it a try for takeout.  Since it was all adults eating I got the Capricciosa and the Cavoletti.  Both were decent but nothing to rave about. It likely would've been better for dine-in as the crust lost some of the crispiness I expected on the short drive home. Found it interesting that the Cavoletti is advertised as \"no red sauce\" but then came with a side of red sauce. As I waited I saw a few salads go by and they looked good.   What really gets me about this place is that they seem to be marketing as an upscale pizza place but it really is not much different than any other counter-service restaurant.  The decor is nice and the patio looks good from the street but there is no bar and again, you order at the counter.    The cooking area is visible from the dining room and there are several young cooks putting together the pizzas. Everyone I interacted with was very friendly but I didn't get the \"highly trained chef\" vibe from anyone. Which makes the menu statement of \"No half toppings... Thank you for respecting our craft\" seem a bit self-aggrandizing.  If you want to keep to a specific menu for whatever reason that is fine but don't try to sell it as some type of lofty 'craft' amongst the army of recently trained pizza builders. I'm fairly certain those employees wouldn't care one way or the other.   Another strange thing is they do not cut the take-out pizzas as a general rule.  My order-taker at the counter informed me of this and gave me the option of having them cut it, which I did. I'm not sure if they cut the dine-in pizzas or if they send along a pizza cutter for you to do it yourself.  The box comes with a graphic showing numerous ways you might cut the pizza at home.  Maybe they are too embroiled in their craft to be bothered with slicing a pizza?   All in all not a bad experience but also not nearly as good as the hype."}
{"text":"YUM!  Inizio delivers a perfect crust. So delicious!   We went with the classic Margherita to get a feel for the pizza. The ingredients were thoughtful and high quality. Our Caesar salad was big, bold, fresh and bright.   We really enjoyed our lunch"}
{"text":"There are no words. I could eat this pizza every day of my life. Get the pistachio pesto pizza. It will change your life. Staff is beyond friendly, atmosphere is perfect, and the new location is great! The patio is also awesome and situated right under a huge tree with some good shade.  Do yourself a favor and go here. Like now. Thank me later."}
{"text":"I'm so happy we finally have authentic Neapolitan pizza in Charlotte! I was lucky enough to go to Naples during study abroad, and Inizio tastes just like the pizza I got while I was there. Everyone is really friendly and willing to help out if you have questions. The pizzas are made to order but they cook in about 1 minute so I've never had to wait long. Unfortunately they don't offer lunch specials, but the prices are reasonable considering the quality of the ingredients.   As for what to order, I usually get the Margherita, but the Pistachio, Diavola, and Bianca flavors are really good too. They have a decent selection of local craft beers on draft, as well as some wine (half price bottles on Monday and Tuesday!!) and gelato. Be advised that you won't be able to order a slice, but they do have personal sized pizzas and large sized pizzas. While you wait for your meal to cook, they have water and cucumber water in self-serve pitchers, as well as toppings like peppers, cheese, red pepper flakes, garlic, and olive oil. They also give you a cup of marinara to dip your crust in for free with your pizza! I work right across the street so come here often and have yet to be disappointed."}
{"text":"I love pizza. Like love it- so much I was yelping Charlotte pizza before we even moved here. Inizio's was one of the first place I booked marked because wood fired is my absolute fave.   On moving day we planned to go for dinner and I am so happy we did. The pizza is AMAZING! All the ingredients are super fresh and the dough is perfectly soft and chewy at the same time. The sauce is perfect and the mozzarella taste like it's straight from Italy.   I always get the MARGARITA and my husband gets the RAFFAELE. Those are our most favorite but we have also tried the PISTACCHIO which is one of the most unique pizzas I have tasted. We loved it! Another one of the specialty pizzas that is a must try is the MARIA ....the truffle creme is Devine.   This is the perfect hangover food, date night spot or a great place to take the kids."}
{"text":"Inizio has some amazing pizza. I stopped in around 4:30 on a Sunday for a late lunch/early dinner and split a small margherita and small bianca with my husband. Ordering is quick and our pizzas came out really fast. This is up there with some of the best neapolitan pizza I've had. And unlike some of my other favorites around the country that have long waits, this place is quick and simple. The crust has the perfect chew and the cheese is fresh and flavorful. We also loved the sauce--and the side of sauce they gave us for dipping. They have a great outdoor patio, too."}
{"text":"I was counting down the days for this beauty to open! I liked Wolfman Pizza because it was different from the norm..but Inizio's Knocks it out of the park. Now I am from Chicago so that means I have a different palate than the southerners down here for Pizza....This is Not Chicago Pizza..this is TRUE AUTHENTIC  PIZZA from Italy. The Crust is where we will start..Outstanding. made with a perfect flour .Love the wood fired flavor! The toppings..I think I am sitting in a cafe in the  Mediterranean ordering the toppings I love!  The Pistachio pesto is superb! The Fresh Ricotta - just like Grandma Annuziata's . We sampled three of the Pizzas - we loved them all! The condiment bar is great with Olive Oil --fresh and tasty with hot oil also..some lovely flavored water.  Spicy Hot peppers and  Pecorino Cheese add to the choices! The staff is very accommodating. Anything you need they will get you!  The salads are a meal in themselves with the Arugula being my favorite!  Great selection of Craft Beers and wine. But the outstanding thing is ---when you get to the end there is Gelato...Now it is expensive but in this case you get what you pay for ! It is lovely and flavorful! We had to take it home..we were stuffed from the great pizza and salad..but do not under any circumstance leave without the Gelato...Salted Caramel and Coffee, my favorites! Can't believe I am this lucky to have it right next to my Harry Teeters!! GO...really...Go!"}
{"text":"Wow unbelievable  Super hot ovens cook your Pizza in 90 seconds. Not a microwave  pizza was great. We had the sausage and peppers taaaasssssttttyyy"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place by far. The dough is amazing and the atmosphere is great. Major plus with seating outside."}
{"text":"Probably gonna be my pizza place! Absolutely amazing food and gelato! Great staff too!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love pizza and have tasted a lot of pizza in Charlotte. This is our favorite in town- hands down!"}
{"text":"Went back tonight and wow it was so good! Told us it would be ready in 7-10 min and it was out in 5!"}
{"text":"Believe the hype! I've been reading about this new hot spot for a while now. I was hoping the place wouldn't be packed, because every picture I've seen, the place was crawling with people. Not today. We entered after the lunch rush and not a soul was there. Great in my book.   We ordered the arugula salad and the CAPRICCIOSA Pizza, which comes with Artichoke, Prosciutto Ham, Mushroom, San Marzano Tomato Sauce, Buffalo Mozzarella. What a freaking home run! The pizza was done in less than 2 minutes and awesome: there's hot oil, olive oil, hot peppers, and pecorino cheese available and believe me it doesn't need it. Great place. Definitely coming back.  ************ Very important side note. My wife is celiac and we came here as an experiment to see if she gets sick off this pizza. She did not. The flour is \"00\" and imported from Italy."}
{"text":"We decided sunday night we would order a pizza and try inizio as they are new to the neighborhood.   Went on line and tried to order.  can only order from the ballantyne location on line,  so I called was told no way to order via phone.  I went there to get a pizza.  .  While waiting counted 11 employees many of which didn't appear to be busy. appeared there were two registers but only one employee taking orders.   Got to my turn and ordered a pizza to go and small gelato to eat while waiting.   woman behind counter asked if I wanted pizza cut, I said sure.    Gelato was delicious and hit the spot.   Got pizza home and had a very soggy pizza.   Interesting there is a stamp on the inside of the box saying they don't cut the pizza because it will make it soggy.   WISH THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN EXPLAINED.   First time visitor and I advised that when I ordered."}
{"text":"I consider myself a conosour of all things pizza.l!  Having grown up in NYC, ventured through Chicago, west coast and all of the east coast, I know fantastic pizza!!  This is fantabulous pizza!!  Hands down one of the best if not the best pizza in Charlotte.  Great job guys!!  You suck for being directly across the street from my house!  I don't need this kind of temptation in my life!!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal pizza and wonderful service! 1/2 off bottles of wine on Tuesday! The pistachio pizza is dynamite!"}
{"text":"Soooooo.......  Finally went here after many many recommendations.   It was a warm Friday evening so we sat outside.   Great craft beer selection.   Ordered two pies and a Caesar salad. Everything was AHMAZING.  I'm talking.   Stupid good ... B U T  .....management ?!?!       Ridiculously.   AWESOME !!  Our pies took a little extra time. We didn't say a word. We actually were just starting to notice that others were getting their food before us when our pies arrived.  Followed by owner ?  Manager?  Robin Hood?  Not sure.  But he was so gracious and awesome and handed us a $30 gift card for waiting for service we hadn't even complained about   Talk about the ultimate in customer service !    Will we be back ?!   Hell yes!  Didn't need a gift card to convince me. But you best believe I'm a customer for life now.   #howyoudoit"}
{"text":"Just had lunch here with son who lives in Raleigh.  Best pizza in the state, nothing in Triangle compares to it!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and outdoor space looks awesome too - too hot tonight to sit outside.  The service was excellent and very friendly.  There was a line to order when I left 7:00 pm - but as they become more proficient at the order desk - i'm sure the lines will recede.  The pizza was amazing!  The crust was sublime and the flavor was awesome.  I look forward to trying all their intriguing combinations! I give four stars for these reasons:  the toppings were so skimpy almost comical.  The pancetta was diced in tiny, tiny pieces and there was literally only 2 or three tiny pieces on each slice.  As I said the flavor was fantastic - but a little more generosity on the toppings would be appreciated.  The only other issue to note is - the restaurant was incredibly loud.  Lots of families - but the acoustics were not conducive to intimate conversation."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Charlotte and probably the state.  Thin, floppy Neapolitan style pizza with quality ingredients- mozzarella and ricotta imported from Naples, San Marzano tomatoes.  I usually get the Margherita or the Bianca, which is the best white pie I've ever had.  The specialty pies, including the the Raphaela (sausage and sweet red peppers) and the pistachio pesto pie are also awesome.  I always add the provided fresh minced garlic and delicious hot chili oil to each slice, although the flavor stands alone.  Would put this place against most well-regarded spots in NYC.  Also, the managers and staff are lovely.  So happy this place is in South Charlotte!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is dane good. Of course growing up in NY we are kind if pizza snobs!  Lol. But for North Carolina they got it right. They are more like artesian pizzas than your typical Italian joint. The crust is thin and there are many toppings to choose from. We got the mushroom and buffalo Mozzarella 15\" and the Broccoli Spinach and cheese 15\". For three of us that was a lot so we took some to go. I like the olive oil bar where you can mix up dipping sauce. I used everything!  Olive oil, red pepper flies, Parmesan cheese and crushed fresh garlic!  Yum. I'd go back again for sure!"}
{"text":"The best pizza in the world ever! My entire family loves this place!!! The pistachio pizza is something you have to try!!"}
{"text":"We had the pistachio pesto pizza and loved it. This is not your average pizza place. Very, very good."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza! Not too much bread, tons of Meat and the sauce is very tasty. Glad this place opened near our house.  Wish they delivered though..."}
{"text":"This South Charlotte pizza joint serves up authentic Neapolitan pies on a perfectly baked crust, with a wonderful selection of delicious toppings that will satisfy any appetite. Inzio treats pizzamaking like a craft to be savored, not a product to be churned out for the masses. So while you'll pay more for a pie here than at most other local restaurants, you won't regret the modest upcharge. My family shared the 18' Margharita pizza, which was delivered to our table in less than 10 minutes fresh from an oven that looked like it had been delivered straight from Italy. Even my picky six-year-old was devouring the warm, crispy slices, and for once, we didn't need a take-home box for leftovers.  In addition to the pizza, my wife and I also shared a wonderful Caesar salad, and the gelato and cannolis were the perfect ending to a wonderful meal. There's also a great selection of wines by the glass and 4 - 5 craft beers on tap, including some great local brews like Olde Meck Copper and Birdsong's Higher Ground. My only complaint is that the restaurant wasn't yet serving personal pies when we visited, although the owner assured me they were only a couple weeks away from adding them to the menu.   Inzio comes as close as anything to replicating Antico, an Atlanta pizzeria that sets the standard for authentic craft pies in the South. Charlotte is lucky to have it, and my family and I will definitely be back for more of their delicious pizza."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! I love good authentic Neapolitan pizza. I love a good thin crust with fresh ingredients. Inizio delivers. You walk in and order at the counter. The pizzas come in two sizes - small and large. The small is enough to share. My friend, his son (9 years old) and I ordered 2 small pizzas. We got a small Cavoletti and a small Margherita with sausage and pepperoni. The kid wanted just a plain cheese pizza with sausage and pepperoni, but the girl working the register did a great job convincing him to try to Margherita with basil and garlic. She even stopped by the table later to ask him if he liked it. Great service!  It's a bit of a serve yourself situation with water and condiments, but I'm cool with that. They even had a lemon basil water to drink, which is a great option. The pizza came out very quickly and it smelled delicious!! The Cavoletti was good, but not great. It could have used some more bacon and flavor. I found it bland, but thankfully they gave us marinara sauce to dip it in. The Mergherita, however, was incredible!! That might have been the best pepperoni I've ever had. Thankfully the kid was nice enough to share a piece with me. I think the crust overall could have been thinner and there was definitely some burnt taste going on with the crust in places, but overall it was a good authentic pizza.  Oh, and it was Thursday when they had $2 small gelatos. Yummy! I had the salted caramel and it was incredible! And the whole staff was just so nice. They refilled our waters, even though it was self-serve. I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Aside from enjoying gingerbread cookies, craving anything pumpkin can be one of the greatest (and most ridiculously satisfying) seasonal challenges. Pumpkin pizza (savory)? Sign me up.  I saw a picture of the pumpkin pizza on my Instagram feed, and it was very enticing. Naturally, I decided to give it a try, and I wasn't disappointed. When Tina T visited me few weeks ago, I got my pumpkin and she got the Bianca. Both handcrafted pizzas were baked in wood-fired ovens and came out fresh and delicious.  Next time I'll have to try the Pistachio Pizza. Four and half Yelps."}
{"text":"We've been to Inizio a number of times and bring family and friends who are here visiting. Great pizza - favorite pizza is the pistachio with pesto ! Also the Margherita - you can't go wrong with any of these pizzas and bring a crowd - it's so much fun!"}
{"text":"Soggy Pizza.  They only have one size (16 inch) starting at $18.  Refused to make a pizza half cheese only.  Sucks when you have a 3 year old who doesn't eat any toppings.  I wasn't going to buy him his own $18 pizza and end up spending $40 for the 3 of us.  We wound up having to pick stuff off of his slices.  I worked at a pizza place before as a server.  I wasn't being crazy.  Just wanted one of their specialty pies with one half cheese only.  So they refuse to do half and half but apparently you can't even remove a topping from the whole pie either.  Weird rules for apparently no reason."}
{"text":"I had seen posts about Inizio a few places and finally decided to give it a try. The pizza was amazing and the environment was great! I got a Margherita with pepperoni pizza and it was the best I've had in a while!! It's authentic Italian pizza and I loved every bite!"}
{"text":"Very good! In reading reviews before eating it I saw people complain about the price. I think it is priced well for good pizza with fresh tasting ingredients. If you're looking for cheap mediocre  pizza go to dominos."}
{"text":"Love, lov, luv this place.  Once you walk in someone quickly greets you and is ready to answer questions and take your order.  Once the order is placed a dough frisbee is prep'd, cooked and served with love.  The oil, garlic, cheese and pepper flakes on the table for self serve are a phenomenal idea and appreciated touch.   Once we polished off a couple of pies we managed to finish it all with some cannoli.  Service was as impeccable as the food.  Recommend hands down!"}
{"text":"If you can appreciate the different styles of pizza - - - you'll find Inzio Neopolitan style among the best. Double zero flour to achieve the less dense lighter crust, fresh tomato sauce without the overpowering amount of herbs and the best fresh mozzarella. We enjoy the Margherita with mushrooms.  The salads are fresh and enough to share among 3-4 people if you want just enough as a side salad or starter.   Bottle of Pinot Grigio very reasonably priced or, Peroni Italian beer too is great with the meal.  Total tab was very reasonable for quality and unique style product offered.  This has become one of our favorite places to hang out for a nice casual and relaxing meal.  Obviously may not be for everyone based on some reviews. No doubt there are many traditional pizzerias out there which offer a different experience, price and menus. Variety is good! Of course if you just want to fill your gut with \"manufactured\" pizza there's always many choices in the freezer section in supermarkets and the pretend pizza at Pizza Hut, Dominos, Papa Johns, etc.  Having grown up in NYC and lived in lots of places in the US and overseas, I like that we now have Inzio to choose among our choices. Yes, I am a \"pizza snob\" and willing to pay for my vice."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed in the Napoletana pizza which was almost entirely sauce with very little cheese. I expect cheese in every bite of my pizza! The pistachio pesto was very good but didn't counteract the other pizza which was mostly a lot of sauce."}
{"text":"If you want good pizza, this is the place. Even their salads are amazing if you want something light. We had their pepperoni pizza. The pepperoni is strips and is mouth watering. Pizza is cooked in 90sec which is awesome if you are in a rush. They have extra parmesan, crushed red peppers in cups with lids where you get your utensils. I find that really nice, because sometimes places have them in the shakers and they look dirty. The restaurant itself is kind of in a weird location, but it's wirth it."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice.  The first time I got just a Luigi pizza.  It was pretty good.    The second time we got a Luigi and Diavola.  The Luigi was soggy and inedible.  The Diavola had way too many whole hot peppers and thus inedible as well.  And I love spicy things.  We also got a salad that was OK.  I don't think I will go back because it seems to be a hit or miss place and I just don't think pizza is worth the risk of a $50 miss."}
{"text":"For me the best pizza in all of South Charlotte. Thin base, tasty and generous toppings... it feels like a mini escape in Italy!"}
{"text":"I lived in Italy for 4-years and will happily admit that I'm a huge pizza snob. (I'm also a huge wine, pasta and gelato snob for what it's worth.) I went to Inizio with reservations, thinking no way would they live up to true Napoli pizza. I've never been so happy to be so wrong!!   Everything from the family style tables to the goopy pizza is true Naples. We've had the Pistachio, Margherita and Raffaele pizzas. The Pistachio is my favorite, hands down. The margherita is a close second. I want to add pepperoni next time and that might just give it an edge over the pistachio. I love the wood fired crust and the understated smokey flavor the pizzas get from being quick fired in their Italian ovens. I also love the \"wetness\" of the pizzas. True Napoli pizzas are gooey and goopy from all the sauce and cheese and occasionally grease (the from meat toppings, especially). Inizio's pizzas do not disappoint on the goop factor. They are a messy delight, hard to eat without a knife and fork.   I love the water and condiment area, too. I'm a sucker for infused water and they always have a dispenser with lemon/basil H2O or some other refreshing concoction. On the same counter, they also have the most amazing hot oil. Approach this one with caution if you don't like spicy as it has a serious heat. I love dipping my crust into this spicy, peppery oil. It's delish! They also have regular olive oil, fresh minced garlic, red pepper flakes, grated parm... The list goes on and on.   I know it's going to be hard with such beautiful pizzas staring you down, but try to make room for a salad -- the caprese and arugula are both great! If salads aren't your thing, then save room for dessert. The cannoli are out of this world and filled to order with house made cream. I dream about the salted caramel gelato. And, our most recent selection, the amaretto cheesecake, also impressed... thick and creamy, it stuck to the roof of your mouth in the most amazing way.   As if all of that wasn't enough, they also have a good beer and wine selection. I was impressed to see 5 or 6 craft beers on draught, including Peroni if you want to go 100% Italian. I opted to go a little more local and enjoyed a Triple C Hefeweizen on our last visit.   Counting down the days until our next visit!"}
{"text":"I loved the Providence Road location so much that I would make the half hour plus trek down to Deep South Charlotte once or twice a month for this delicious pizza. Woe to my waistline and pocket book now that there is an Inizio in Dilworth, much closer to both my home and office.   I lived in Italy for 4-years and will happily admit that I'm a huge pizza snob. (I'm also a huge wine, pasta and gelato snob for what it's worth.) I went to the original Inizio with reservations, thinking no way would they live up to true Napoli pizza. I've never been so happy to be so wrong!! Equally happy that their Dilworth location is just as good.   Everything from the family style tables to the goopy pizza is true Naples. We've had the Pistachio, Margherita, Maria, Diavola, Cavoletti, and Raffaele pizzas. The Pistachio is my favorite, hands down. The Maria is a close second. I love the wood fired crust and the understated smokey flavor the pizzas get from being quick fired in their Italian ovens. I also love the \"wetness\" of the pizzas.

{"text":"Pizza is always hot and tasty! I love the rectangle pepperoni! Wish they had more drink choices."}
{"text":"Simply perfect.  The Margherita pizza may be the most perfect food Humanity has ever produced"}
{"text":"I tried Inizio Pizza Napoletana based on the reviews on Yelp and honestly, I was dissapointed. My friend and I ordered small size Pistacchio and Napoletana.  Even though I love pistacchios I wasn't very impressed with the pizza. For some reason, pistacchio pesto sauce was an usuaul taste for me and I didn't like the combination of ricotta and pistachio pesto.  I definitely won't try Napoletana again - I wanted to experiment and tey new things but I learned that anchovy is not something I want in my pizza.  I also got their sea salt gelato and that was delicious - definitely saved the day for me."}
{"text":"The pizza was really delicious, and the service was great and fast. The only think I kind of disliked was that the atmosphere inside was a little loud. I felt like my friend and I had to yell our conversation in order for each other to hear."}
{"text":"Hands down, best pizza in Charlotte. The pistachio pesto pizza is the thing that dreams are made of! I've so far tried four different pizzas and they are all amazing!"}
{"text":"The team at Inizio goes above and beyond to provide world class hospitality. And the best pizza I've ever had."}
{"text":"Super tasty! Great service! Sat outside in a lovely atmosphere. We will definitely be back! The large is definitely a belly filler!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, great crust!  Could be our new favorite. Pizza a strong 5 stars.  The chopped salad was fine, with good quality salami, but I was underwhelmed by the dressing, and something else seemed lacking in the toppings.  Fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Pistachio pizza- soooooooo good. Sounds weird. But try it. Just do it.   By the way- a tip- if you want take out you have to order in the store since the pizzas cook so fast ! :)"}
{"text":"A $22 pizza should knock your socks off. I'm in with 2 stars because the service was good. Pizza was undercooked. Chef came by and asked how it is, but did slowdown when I said it's just ok.  Menu is pretty limited too."}
{"text":"Amazing!! Really cool atmosphere,friendly staff and delicious pizza. We ordered the pistachio pesto pizza...sooo yummy!!! Loved the rustic Naples pizza style with the half priced wine. Definitely come check it out."}
{"text":"Awesome awesome pizza!  We are from NJ, and are VERY particular about our pizza. This place is amazing. We went with 8 people, and we got 3 large sand 2 smalls, and it was just the right amount. Come hungry. You will be able to eat a lot..."}
{"text":"Best NY Style Pizza in Charlotte, NC. Fresh ingredients and best flour. Had a large pizza well done!"}
{"text":"My favorite Pizza in NC the flavors are perfect some maybe a little spicy but really delicious sauce. Super quick, I just wish it was a little bigger it seems always crowded.   Service is on point as well, we highly recommend you to try it."}
{"text":"Good pizza, but it's expensive and not many options.  I do like grabbing a local draft beer before take out."}
{"text":"Absolutely delightful thin crust pizza in the Italian style. Every flavor pizza I had was delicious. The best part is that the pizzas are cooked at a very high temperature and so you can order your pizza and be out the door in 5 mins!"}
{"text":"Went on opening evening and had the NAPOLETANA (Anchovy, Kalamata Olives, San Marzano Tomato Sauce, Buffalo Mozzarella, Basil).  The pizza was very good.  It didn't have as much crunch as I thought it would and it was impossible to pick up a whole piece because it was pretty floppy :)  despite its floppiness it was still very good. The ingredients were definitely fresh and high quality.   There were 2 negatives at this new restaurant: 1.  The payment system uses an insecure swiping mechanism to get your credit card number.  It's really surprising that a new restaurant wouldn't have purchased an up-to-date purchasing system to keep its customers credit cards safe.  They ideally should have NFC reader for contactless payment (such as Apple Pay & nfc cards) but at a minimum, they should have chip readers to use instead of insecure magnetic swipe.    2. They didn't have iced tea :(  That was very strange. Your only options were bottled drinks and water.  If one thing will reduce the frequency of my visits here, it's that I can't have iced tea with my meal. Maybe I'll go by the Chick-fil-A drive-thru and pick up a large tea before my next visit."}
{"text":"The pizza is so good! Truly tastes like what I had in Italy.  The margarita pizza was my favorite.  The kids loved the chocolate gelato too!!  Great find."}
{"text":"Having lived in Italy for 3+ years, I have high standards for a Margherita Pizza. This one did not disappoint. Fresh ingredients, baked perfectly. Terrific crust."}
{"text":"I kept seeing pictures of their pizza on Instagram and it all looked amazing!!! Went last night for the first time and I will definitely be back.  I ordered the mushroom pizza. For all you mushroom lovers out there, it's loaded with them! It has a strong garlic taste - the more garlic the better tho in my opinion. The cheese tasted super fresh. The crust was the perfect amount of crispy. The crust was great plain but even better dipped in the side of marinara sauce. The sauce is on the sweeter side but good nonetheless.  If you're ordering take-out, stop by the water station. They have pre-portioned Parmesan cheese and red pepper flakes for you to take on the go! It looked like there might have been garlic too.   While I didn't get the cannoli - I saw the seasonal flavor at someone's table and it looked amazing. Next time I go, I'll be getting one. They look big enough to split."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! I love it to go and I love it, in restaurant. They have a great outdoor area. Their pizza is very Italian, so it's a bit different than other local pizza joints with regards to texture and ingredients. However, I really appreciated that. The pizza dough is made with all natural ingredients. Added bonus: Their salad and cannolis are fantastic!! May be a little more pricey than other pizza spots, but worth it IMO. Also, in the spirit of being super Italian, the menu is a little hard to pronounce for this mid western gal but feel free to ask questions. The staff is very helpful and friendly. They do serve beer and wine as well.   Great place to bring family and kids, especially to sit outdoors on a nice evening."}
{"text":"What a perfect addition to the Dilworth neighborhood!    Inizio is located in the shopping center with the food lion.  You walk in, order at the  register and your food is brought out to you very very quickly.    There is a station with all of the pizza fixings you want, even fresh garlic, peppers, cheese, etc.  Thanks to other yelp reviews, I ordered the pistachio pizza.  The small had 6 slices which is enough to share with a side or dessert.  The pizza was delicious and it comes with a side of marinara to dip it in.  I love sauce so this was a win in my book.   The environment is very trendy and there is a cute patio out back.  They half half off wine  on Mondays and Tuesday, $3.50 craft beers on Wednesday's, and $2 gelato on Thursday's so plan your meal accordingly...."}
{"text":"I pretty much haven't stopped thinking about this pizza since I had it 2 weeks ago. The ingredients just tasted so fresh! We ordered the Diavolo with the spicy salami. Honestly next time I would get something more basic because the salami took away from the sauce and cheese and crust. We also ordered a caesar salad, which was really good. I love that they serve a side of marinara with the pizza for you to dip the crust in. The atmosphere was great at the Dilworth location and I will definitely be back for a pie on their beautiful patio once it cools off."}
{"text":"Excellent space, with plenty of metal and wood that just gives the place a great feel. Even the stools at the high tables are made of heavy pipes, which is different, yet completely workable. A nice touch on some of the tables (outside only? I wasn't paying too much attention) was the actual herbs, such as basil, where you can tear it and add it to your pizza. Oh, you weren't supposed to do that? Sorry.  When it comes to pies, they have these massive ovens, apparently shipped directly to them, where the real wood gets up to a thousand degrees. I think I heard them say that. I'm not sure how they measure it, because the thermometer on the front only goes up to 500, but it is pegged well past that number. I know it's hot back there, and that the pies cook in something like 90 seconds - and they come out scorched. Seriously. In 90 seconds, they have blackened in spots. Try that at home.  As to those pies, you can get flavors like Diavola, which is just what it sounds like - make sure you get plenty of the peppers, as they are what adds the taste to it. Also make sure you try the Pistacchio, which is a pesto with pistachio nuts on it. Plenty of variety for everyone and these babies are big, so come hungry. But if you still have room, get some gelato when you are done. Mix 'em up for the best flavors. Sea salt and chocolate go well together (but probably not on pizza)."}
{"text":"Pizza was very very good. On the greasy side but that is the style and expected. The pizza is made extremely fast from scratch and their spicy peppers were LEGIT! If I had to give this place one negative it would be the price. I loved the pizza and the whole atmosphere but around $30 for a large pizza and two drinks was a bit steep. That will not stop me from going again on occasions though."}
{"text":"So worth the drive from North Charlotte! Inizio is the kind of pizza I love - chewy, bubbly crust with a tangy taste. We ordered the smaller pistachio pesto pizza to share and a cannoli to finish. Just the right amount of food for the both of us. I would come back here and recommend it to others if I was in the area. I've missed good pizza since moving to Charlotte 3 years ago and I feel like I've found a worthy substitution between trips to Zavino in Philadelphia."}
{"text":"If you are craving Neapolitan style pizza, this is the way to go! We've been to the Matthews location several times and we are very glad they have come to Dilworth. We came in on Saturday morning and were one of two parties in the whole restaurant. We shared the Diavola small pie and it was plenty for two. It's like a spicier pepperoni pizza, you can pick off the peppers if they are not your scene. We typically order the Pistacchio pizza, I would recommend that one, as well. The dough is chewy and flavorful with charred edges. The complimentary red sauce for dipping crusts is delicious. If you have room, absolutely order a lemon cannoli. I came home late from work once to one of these gems in a take out box. I told myself I would just take a bite and head to bed. Next thing I knew I was eating the entire thing because it was so fresh and lightly sweet. My new favorite as I typically order the classic. Step aside classic, the lemon is in town!"}
{"text":"Disappointing, taste of pizza was not great. Love wood-fired pizzas, but the crust on ours didn't have a very good taste."}
{"text":"Inizio Pizza is the best around. Their pistachio pizza is to-die-for. If you get a chance, stop by and try their peanut butter gelato -- it puts Va Da Vie to shame & so does the customer service. Peter was especially helpful!"}
{"text":"One of the best new Pizza spots in Dilworth. Definitely worth checking out.  Our first taste of the Pizze Speciall is the Pistachio.  Fresh ingredients, quick service with plentiful staff working as a team.  The ambiance is industrial vibe like similar places in Dilworth but with a modern touch.  Complimentary self serve water, lemon water and you should even try their special Spicy Oil, it's incredible.  We were coming to another spot when we noticed Inizio; people were coming in and out so I checked yelp and of course pictures speak louder than words.  Their serving platers from the modern looking wood fire Pod ovens seem like it makes it easy for the staff to clean up. Silverware is already at the tables with rolls of paper towels to use as needed.  Will definitely be back to try out the next specialty flavors!  Also Thursday, they have $2 Gelato that Look freshly made here."}
{"text":"Great cool place to have a beer and a classic Italian pizza. We had the Pistacchio pizza which was a pesto based pizza made with pistachios instead of pine nuts. It also had Rosemary, ricotta, garlic and buffalo mozzarella. Yes that's mozzarella made with buffalo milk. Just so flavorful. All I can say is Shit Ya!!! We are coming back to try all of the rest of the pizzas."}
{"text":"Um lets see........I love love it love it.  What else to say.  If you don't try it out you're missin out. Excellent dough, pizza comes out in a jiff and they have minced garlic if you want more. Did I say I love it?"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in town. Neapolitan brick oven pizza with Buffalo Mozzarella, imported tomatoes , imported dough, etc. and where they cook the pizza for like a minute in the massive brick oven or something... Fantastic ingredients. We came at a very odd, non busy hour and the staff was super friendly and attentive. Food was an A+"}
{"text":"So exciting to have a cool new kind of pizza place in South Charlotte. Went there with the family on a weeknight and checked it out. Exciting that all of the main ingredients are imported from Italy. Been on an Italy kick lately.   The pizzas are pretty large. We ordered two for our family of five including 2 hungry teens. You can order a specialty pie or create your own. If you create your own you can get two toppings max as the crust is thin though the edges are thick and doughy like breadsticks.   We ordered the Margherita and one with spicy salami and sausage. The ingredients were fresh and the service was quick. We also got the Italian chopped salad which was a nice change from your typical salad with olives and ham as well.   Get wines by the glass or bottle and beers too. Certainly looking forward to going back without the kids to try some of the more specialty pies."}
{"text":"While Inizio has an adorable space, I was sadly not a fan of the pizza. I did not like how I was unable to create my own nor really sub anything out. You also cannot buy by the slice, which can be rather annoying as not everyone can always agree on a pie. I also felt like the pizza had a burnt taste to it-- yes, yes I know it's wood fire stove, but still, something was odd! Service was fine, but more of a walk through station sort of feel! I did love the add-loves and sauces at the end."}
{"text":"The pizza is amazing!  We ordered the PISTACCHIO = Rosemary, Sea Salt, Ricotta, Buffalo Mozzarella, Garlic, Pistachio Pesto Sauce for $22 plus $4 to add a topping.  We added pepperoni and it was fabulous on the pizza!  This pizza was large enough to feed 3 hungry adults and left us full and satisfied.  We started out with a CAPRESE salad that cost $10 with the following Arugula, Buffalo Mozzarella, Sliced Tomato, Fresh Basil, Sea Salt, Balsamic Glaze.  The salad was refreshing and the Balsamic Glaze was delicious!  Even after being pleasantly full I couldn't resist some mango gelato.  This was the perfect ending to my meal and was very satisfying!  The staff was very friendly and helpful!  My new favorite pizza joint in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza!  A friendly and caring staff who really cares about your enjoyment of the food.  My husband and I had the best pizza date night.  The pizza was fresh, and tasted great. Even getting there just 1 hour before closing we didn't feel rushed. The staff was warm and friendly; added plus,  the pizza was delicious!  Koodoos,  we'll  be back!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to see a new pizza spot in Charlotte and of course had to try while I was home visiting for the weekend. It's in a convenient location right in Dilworth so you can't miss it.  We tried to call in our order ahead of time so the pick-up would be quick as we were in a rush. We were told by a rude employee that the restaurant did not allow that and we would have to come in and wait. Luckily it was off timing and when we arrived the restaurant was completely empty. The inside is nicely decorated and clean, a little hipster. There are big wood ovens for the pizza and a small selection of gelato if you have a sweet tooth.  We ordered a small margarita pizza which was plenty for two to split. When we got it home, we discovered the pizza had not been cut. After reading the box it seems to be because the dough dries out after cutting it, so FYI if you take it to go make sure you have something to cut it with.  The flavors were good, nothing to go crazy over. Pretty standard pizza place at a little higher than delivery prices."}
{"text":"Delicious food, friendly staff, and a fun environment. Inizio's offers authentic Italian pizza with fresh ingredients. I've been a few time and love going because the pizza is fantastic!  A nice perk is the the European industrial design/decor, which is refreshing for a suburban location."}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place for many reasons. The pizza is wonderful! They have fewer choices than most pizza places but that allows them to produce a high-quality pie!  The staff work hard to ensure you enjoy your visit. Great service and fun atmosphere. Give it a try! We now go once a week. It's that good"}
{"text":"This place is packed on a Fri/Sat night, and I am a fan!  You order at the counter and then find your own seat - inside or outside, or share a community table with another group.  The atmosphere is wonderful.  Or order to-go ahead of time and it serves as a great night in.  The pizza itself is wonderful - love the thicker crust and it's delicious.  They have lots of unique flavors that I love - try the brussel sprout pizza or the pistachio (kind of like a pesto pizza!).  Haven't had a pizza that I didn't like there.  They also have lots of great sauces to go along with it, and word on the street is they have some good gelato!"}
{"text":"This is definitely some of the best pizza I've had. The crust is thin, chewy, but not soggy. The tomato sauce that comes with the pizza is divine - so good for dipping crust in and almost drinkable. That being said, you do have to pay a premium price for it. We made the mistake of only ordering one 16\" pizza for 4 people and a salad, thinking it would be enough. But since the crust is so thin, we each could have easily had 3 slices. We debated ordering another one but decided against it in the end, although we did see another family go up and order another pizza after they had finished... What we will do next time is get 2 12\" ones. We tried the Raffaele, which had amazing flavor from the red peppers, sausages, cheese, and sauce all coming together. We also tried one of the salads, which was ok but not amazing/really worth it. I will be back for the pistachio because the pictures look so good."}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic Italian pizza and excellent service. The pistachio is our favorite."}
{"text":"This place is super cute and delicious!  The staff is very friendly and nice and great at answering questions.  I got the margarita pizza here and it was fantastic!  All of the ingredients were really fresh and delicious.  The service is super quick as well, their pizzas only take 90 seconds to cook because they cook the pizza in 900 degrees.  They also serve wine and beer here which you don't see at every pizza place with a great selection.  They also have a little station for Parmesan, chili's, red pepper flakes, garlic, and a spicy oil.  The oil is spicier than I expected so don't be surprised when you need a drink after trying it.  Overall I had a great experience at this restaurant and it definitely fills you up.  I highly recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is so fresh and authentic--fresh ingredients and baked to perfection! The gelato is a creamy bite of heaven!  The service is top notch and staff is very knowledgable. Inizio is the real deal!"}
{"text":"Several years ago we rented a car in Italy and drove all over the country. Of course, every town has its pizza. This pizza is a true representation of the Italian wood fired pizza we found all over. To be clear, this is not the New York style pizza I grew up with and you really can't compare the two.  The dough is thin and fluffy with less crunch. The sauce is light as is the cheese. It is obvious that the chef cares about his ingredients. San Marzano tomatoes, extra virgin olive oil and fresh herbs. Try the margherita. A simple and beautiful thing. Come with an open mind and an empty stomach. You will not regret it.  One thing I would love to see would be a lunch special with an 8 inch small pie. The portions are large, which is a great thing, but it's hard to stop by from work on your own for a quick bite on a lunch budget."}
{"text":"We've been eating this type of pizza at least twice per month in NYC for the past 9 years. Also, we've had it in Italy several times. So, I can assure you that this is the real deal. However, this establishment is only 3 weeks old and still ironing out some kinks. The crust, sauce, and cheese are perfect. The crust was a bit soggy by the end of the pie. Also, I'd like double the amount of cheese, but this review is only applicable to the type of pizza I tried (anchovy and olive). The interior is stylish, spotlessly clean, and comfortable. Wait staff are friendly and attentive. This place is using high end ingredients and charging fair prices. I plan to visit them again soon and frequently!!"}
{"text":"Wow! What a hidden gem. We had friends that kept telling us how amazing this pizza was and we procrastinated for too long. We went in on a Friday night and it was packed for a reason! Some of the most delicious pizza we've ever been able to sink our teeth into. The Bianca is incredibly tasty and full of garlic - the Margherita pizza is perfect for the kiddos and that crust.... oh my, that crust. It's perfect. It's chewy, it's not the crust you cut off and toss - if you save room, the Canolis are as tasty as the ones my Italian grandmother used to make. YUM. We are new regulars and hope they have great success with their new location in Southend area."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place... the flavor is Amazing!!! I really recommend this place.  The service is so great too!  Such a gem i love this place."}
{"text":"My favorite slice in all of Charlotte! With a restaurant that prioritizes the freshest and the best ingredients, you can expect to get amazing food and Inizio does just that. Not only that, their decor is rustic, hip, and exceptionally photogenic.   Once you walk in, you order and pay at the counter, then take a seat wherever you want. Water, plates, etc is also self-serve at Inizio.   On my first visit, I tried the Pistachio pizza and one of their seasonal cannolis (at that time it was pumpkin). Both was incredibly delicious! Love the crust of the pizza and the cannoli filling was so creamy!   Can't wait to come back and try the gelato and their other pizzas! Also, the prices are very reasonable for the portion sizes. The \"personal\" size pizza was well enough for 2 (or maybe 3 if you guys are small eaters). Also check out their weekly specials for their drink promos are very good."}
{"text":"Pizza was quick and amazing. I must say maybe the best pizza in this side of town. I would def recommend."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza!  So light and delicious. Lots of tempting choices. Love the atmosphere too. Great addition to our area. We will be back."}
{"text":"This place is great. I give it four stars because I feel the price is about 10% too high. I would come more. I know the preparation and product they use it higher end.   Pistachio is amazing. Sounds odd, but try it. You really can't go wrong with the choices here.  I tend to go weekdays during the lunch and stuff comes out very quickly. I am thinking 10 minutes for a pizza.  I am disappointed they also shrank their desert offerings. Loved me that cheesecake."}
{"text":"Pizza is seriously amazing!!!! We were encouraged to get the Diavalo as my friend and I enjoy spicy food. It did not dissapoint! We also shared a very good arugala salad! Topped out with a to die for chocolate chip canolie (sp?)!!! You have to go!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised with a happy ending. Tonight was our first time. Inizio doesn't do half and half pizza. No bread sticks on the menu. I was a bit irritated at the register while ordering.   I've eaten pizza in several European countries including Italy. I tend to be a sob when it comes to pizza. Omg, the pizza is the best. My boys would agree on the pizza, cannoli and creamy gelato. Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"Yum! So glad we stopped here while visiting Charlotte. They make their pizzas at 900 degrees for 90 seconds. The pizza was so good and the atmosphere was so cool. We got a margarita pizza and a Maria pizza. The margarita was our favorite but the Maria was good too. Wish we had a place like this at home"}
{"text":"Well we had try this just based on the reviews. Now you all have to keep in mind they have pizzas salads and gelato. Very simple. Very good. Fast. Very good. Will definitely be back. Had margarita pizza and Caesar salad and I had raspberry sorbet and my Hubble had chocolate chip gelato. All delish."}
{"text":"We ordered the margarita pizza and the chopped salad. The pizza was good, it's not mind blowing but good. There was a lot of garlic and it seemed a bit dry but I would go back and ask for extra sauce and just a little garlic and that should solve that. The salad was excellent and between that and the pizza it was plenty of food for me and my wife. All and all we enjoyed it and will be back for sure.   Update  I'm going to increase my review to 5 stars! We have been back here more times than I can count at this point and each time has been better than the last.  I think they have it down now, all the kinks have been worked out and the pizza is excellent, there's nothing like it in Charlotte. If you are a pizza junky you MUST try this place."}
{"text":"The pizza was so delicious. We ordered the MARGHERITA D.O.P. pizza and it was excellent! I love how they don't load it with a pound of cheese. The sauce was perfect. I have to say this is the best pizza that we have had in Charlotte. I liked the setup of the restaurant too. The atmosphere is casual but upscale at the same time. The pizza arrived at our table within 7 minutes of ordering! Can't wait to go back here. It's my new go-to place for authentic, out of this world pizza."}
{"text":"MADONNA MIA!!! BEST PIZZA IN CHARLOTTE!!! THIS NEW YORKER KNOWS PIZZA!!! This new place is doing it right!! The crust is charred and bubbly with a great chew, fresh mozzarella and a fresh tomato sauce takes this pizza over the top! We had the marguerita pizza and it was done in a couple minutes. The caprese salad had big chunks of fresh buffalo mozzarella and baby arugula with baby spinach and a balsamic drizzle. It came with two pieces of their pizza crust to dip. Wow, loved it. The manager came over and talked to us about the place. He was really cool. The only thing I'm pissed about it that we left our leftover pizza there!!!! Fongool!!! But, we will be back!!  Arrivaderci!!"}
{"text":"This is a somewhat generous rating thanks to the atmosphere and exceptional customer service.   The big negative is a lack of taste for the pizza. I wasn't sure if it was just me, but my wife mentioned the same thing prior to me saying anything. The crust, however, is soft.   The gelato is good, but not as good as Alino's up in Mooresville. A few other notes...  There is indoor and outdoor seating.  The lower benches are more comfortable and spacious.  There is flavored water and plain water that you can get yourself from jugs. The bathrooms are small but clean.  As expected due to higher-quality ingredients, prices are on the high side. Pizza is cooked in 90 seconds."}
{"text":"I loved this place!! I lived in Naples, Italy for 7 years growing up and been back in the USA for 13 years. The pizza was perfect! The buffalo mozzarella added exactly what I was hoping! I got the pizza Bianca and it took my back to my Naples days! I completely recommend the cannoli. It was heavenly, and exactly what I had been craving at 24 weeks pregnant   If you don't know about pizza from this region, it is supposed to have burnt spots. The sauce is thinner and tangy. It's not meant to be heavy like American pizza. The crust is smooth and not crispy. It'll more resemble naan, but better!   My Fiancé ordered the Diavola which he enjoyed. He said the peppers were a little salty to him, but likely because they are imported (canned).  My future mother-in-law is vegan, and she was able to simply ask for no cheese and add veggies for her pizza. The staff was very accommodating. I recommend for larger parties. It seems like the seating is perfect for that! The decor is also very pleasant!  My only suggestion would be to get some San Benedetto Peach Tea!"}
{"text":"BEST pizza in the area and one of the closest we've had to Neapolitan style pizza in Italy. And, the customer service is amazing - Liz and Peter were awesome to chat with about European traveling and pizza making. Our second visit this weekend alone - I think you have some new regulars. P.S. get the chocolate chip cannoli!"}
{"text":"Truly, I would give this spot 3.5 stars. I also think it would've been better if we got there a little earlier - we got there about an hour before they closed and I got the sense that everyone who worked there was in a rush to get to closing. My husband and I ordered pizza, excited to try this spot because I had heard such good things about it.   I am a lover of crust and I was conflicted about theirs. The edge of the pizza was burnt in a few spots and towards the center didn't seem done enough. I couldn't pick up a slice because it would immediately fold down and the toppings would fall off of it. Speaking of the toppings - I liked them a lot. My husband loved how crispy the pepperoni was.   What kept this from being 3 stars rather than 4? It was somewhat pricey to me when I compare it to its competitors. Overall, we will revisit this spot but it won't be at the top of the list."}
{"text":"Ok. Wow. Like wow. A little background. I first tried this style of pizza back in 2010 in Atlanta at the Goliath Antico Pizza. My wife and I loved it and the standard as to judge all other pizza was born. I then found mighty DeSano pizza in Nashviile in 2013 and knew I had found anther love.  Then, the day before my birthday in June, we trekked to Mooresville and found Alino Pizzeria. Hot damn, now I had finally found a real pizza place that could give Antico a run for their money AND they were only an hour away from my south Charlotte abode. Life was good, I was content... Or so I thought. Then, I heard about Inizio. Wait what?  10 minutes from my house and has been open for 5 months?  No, how have I not heard?  So, I texted my friend Will and said  \"Hey, there is a pizza place near your house we just decided we want to try tonight. Any interest in meeting us over there in a little bit?\"   His exact response,  \"What time\" \"Inizo's is the shit\" \"And they have cheap gelato on Thursdays\" Two things then occurred to me: 1. Wow, this place is so good it doesn't even have to be named! and; 2.  Will is such a shit, keeping this great place all to himself and NEVER mentioning it me  That being said, the fam and I packed up the Acadia and headed to meet Will for dinner. We ordered the Margherita pizza and the Pistachio pizza w/ pepperoni. Look at the picture I posted, this stuff is the real deal. Here's what happened when I took my first bite of the pistachio pizza. The whole world slowed down. Honest to God, like stopped. My kids were yapping in slow motion. Antico, DeSano, and Alino all slid down my mind as this new pizza giant  clearly rose to the top. Can pizza really be that amazing? Is this dudes review really on point?  Well put down your iPhone and go find out for yourself. But seriously, the quality of the crust, the perfection of the pistachio pesto base, the sensational blend of quality ingredients, the soft fresh ricotta, the mild yet salty buffalo mozzarella, and the paper thin crispy pepperoni. BOOM. Yea, it's that good. And Will is right, $2 gelato on Thursday. I had the sea salt caramel. Unbelievable. The way the caramel stands out so clearly but in such a clean crisp way on your tongue is true magic. I really can't say anything even remotely negative about this visit. Go there. Get pizza. Get gelato. Enjoy life. It's that simple. Sorry Will, the secrets out...."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place! I've struggled to find good pizza in charlotte and Inizio is fantastic- it reminds me of the pizza I had when I studied abroad in Florence! Authentic Neapolitan style pizza made fresh to order and some great local beers on draught. The staff was also very friendly and helpful.  My friend had the Raffaele (Sweet Pepper, Sausage, Roasted Onion, San Marzano Tomato Sauce, Buffalo Mozzarella, Garlic, Pecorino) and I had the Cavoletti (Brussels Sprout, Pancetta, Fior De Latte, Pecorino, Buffalo Mozzarella) and both were amazing. I was so impressed with Cavoletti because they managed to put Brussels sprouts on a pizza and it actually worked! Amazing. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Inizio has become a local favorite of ours. We have dined in once and ordered pizza to go many times.  Our favorites pizzas are the Diablo and the Pistachio (sounds weird but you must try it)! The pizza is delicious. The pizzas are VERY thin crust, and they flop down when held up. The standard size pizza is about $12 and the large is around $22. The standard size is not enough for two to share unless you have very small appetites. The large is enough for 2-3 people depending on appetites.   I have awarded 4 stars because I think that the pizzas are a bit expensive for their size. At Mellow Mushroom (another specialty pizza spot) a large is plenty to feed 3+. Additionally, I think their salads leave something to be desired, and are also small for the price."}
{"text":"Super pricey for what you get, but yummy and quality ingredients. A \"small\" is the perfect size for two people to share."}
{"text":"You walk in and order at the counter where helpful staff is waiting to help you understand how their menu is set up and describe a little bit about their ingredients. The pizza is a little on the pricey side and the waitstaff helped us decide what was more cost efficient (building your own pizza vs. selecting one of their specialty recipes and swapping out an ingredient to customize to your liking).   Good selection of local beers but once again it was a little on the pricey side (~$7 pint). You help yourself to glasses of water, fresh hot olive oil, various condiments for the pizza, etc.   Tables are large community style tables and the decor is very modern but clean and inviting.   You can see them rolling and preparing the pizza dough in a special room that has lots of windows right there front and center.... almost as cool as seeing the big ovens in action as they cook your pizza!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I frequently visit Inizio. There is no pizza place like it in Charlotte. The combo of fresh ingredients, great service and a laid back dining vibe make for a great night out.  The pizza menu differs from traditional pizza joints, so if you're looking for a sausage and pepperoni pizza this might not be the place for you. As long as you are looking to try something new, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"This  pizza was by far the best pizza in all of Charlotte. Everything down to the crust was good.The crust was so easy to eat and I'm not a crust eater. You heard it first here ladies and gentlemen I am officially a crust eater now.   The location is actually really good except there wasn't much parking when I came here because there was a dog event going on. When you're actually watching people make your pizza it is really interesting and refreshing to know they care about quality!   It is a little pricy but honestly sometimes you pay for what you get and I will keep coming back here! It is definitely worth the try and I am sure you will keep coming back! This place converted me to a crust eater. You know it has to be good."}
{"text":"Probably the best pizza I've ever had. Not sure who thought it was a good idea to put pistachios on pizza but.... thank you. That pistachio pizza rocked my world. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Limited menu of perfection. Love eating here.  Look forward to my next visit.  Would like more bottle beer selections."}
{"text":"Wow!! I'm thankful for this amazing place that is only 20mins from my house :). We used to drive 45mins to Mooresville to eat Alino's, but this place has WAY BETTER pizza! The crust is more robust and holds the sauce and cheese really well. I had my whole family with us and we ordered a Pistacio Pesto pizza, Pizza Margherita, and a Margherita with pepperoni.  The pesto pizza was delish! It had creamy cheese dolloped on and beautiful toasty pistacios; my family that eats meat LOVED the pepperoni pizza; and we all devoured the gorgeous Pizza margherita. I also ordered the arugula salad....it was alright, but left a lot to be desired for the price. Next time we'll just do pizza.   Lauren, the hostess who took our order was as sweet as can be and even gave us some nice coupons for our next visit!! Thank you Inizio's for existing and making such lovely pizza!"}
{"text":"As far as fancy pizza goes, this is hands down the best I've had in Charlotte. The line was 20 people deep at 8pm, so it's definitely popular. We got the pistachio pizza and the seasonal pumpkin pizza. Both were phenomenal. The crust was the best pizza crust I've ever had and having extra EVOO for dipping was great. We also got the lemon ricotta cannoli and the seasonal pumpkin cannoli. The pumpkin was delicious, but the lemon was just okay. We ordered small pizzas and they were pretty big. We definitely could have split a small pizza between two of us, so don't shy away because of the $15 price tag. It was a little nosier inside than I would have liked, but the decor was very well done. We'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Well.. I will first say that pizza is a tough food to rate as people simply like different kinds. We just finished eating here and I will say that the staff is super friendly. Very attentive and nice.  The place itself is not comfortable to sit in. Cramped quarters and table sharing. The high top tables are painful to sit in. Again, some people like them.   The pizza was bland to me - surprisingly so. However, the crust is very good. Now, as I mentioned earlier - pizza is a specialized preference and I know some people fight over pineapple on pizza. For us, pineapple is life. we love versions of Hawaiian pizza. However, no pineapple found here.  We got the margarita pizza and the pistachio pesto.  The pizza to me is rated a 2.. wish we would have gotten one with meat on it. Again, nothing wrong - just didn't fit our taste.  We then got the cannoli and wow, loved it.  The cannoli and the staff made this a 3 star - the pizza can stay.  At least for us.  If we go back, would try one with meat etc. Not sure we will go back. Especially dropping $35 on 2 small pizzas with limited toppings after tax. Also - no refills and no sweet tea. Just bottles."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place in Charlotte! Can't go anywhere else now. Also, we will drive here just for the gelato. It's 100% worth it"}
{"text":"Again, violating my rule to wait until at least two visits to review something. But dang, Inizio, you really took the cake last night. With a large variety of wood fired pizzas and quality ingredients, The Lady and I didn't have a wrong choice, but I think we chose wisely in ordering the Raffaele (tomato sauce based with sweet peppers, sausage, herbs and lots of cheese) and the Pistacchio (pesto, pistachio, herbs, big dollops of cheesy goodness). They have the standard cheese and pepper flakes in shakers, but also have fresh minced garlic as well as hot peppers in little solo containers that can really elevate your flavors.  Service was fast, attentive, and helpful. We took ourselves outside on that gorgeous patio, and our food was at our table within 5 minutes. Fast fire, man. Crazy cool. Pizza was honestly a bit chewier than I expected, but intense flavors and the crust was nice and airy. All pizza comes with a San Marzano marinara sauce and I took our waitress' advice and used it to dip the crust into. Pro suggestion right there, that was great.  The Lady and I decided to share (bad idea) a cannoli to take home, so we both fought Mortal Kombat style over a pistachio cannoli once we got home. Excellent cream filling, and we saw it made in front of us! (+2). At about $15 for a personal pizza, I thought it was a bit much, but both The Lady and I managed to only eat half of our respective pies and take the rest home, so I'm calling it $7.50/meal... but that's only when I have self control.  There's tons to return for, including features, seasonals, and side dishes like a caprese salad I saw a girl make. Also, for fall, there's a pumpkin cream pizza. I think you have to be wearing Uggs in order to get it though. AND I think I saw/heard a rooftop.... I'll be back to check that out."}
{"text":"After got disappointed with several pizza places, I was eagerly looking for a good pizzeria in the neighborhood. I am glad that I finally found one! We ordered pistachio pizza and it was very good. For pistachio lovers like me, I enjoyed it. It was thin and baked perfectly, not too burnt. Other than food, staffs are very nice and attentive. Even though they don't take your order at the table, they check on table to table if everything is okay. They know how to provide good service other than good food. I will definitely go back to try other pizzas."}
{"text":"I have been here many times with girlfriend, and would highly recommend. High quality ingredients and very friendly service. They realized that a minor topping had been left off our pizza before the brought it to our table. They apologized for the wait and gave us the other pizza to take home. This is my favorite pizza place in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Ohhhh my!!! This is out of this world pizza. I've have pizza all over the world and really nothing compares. The crust is insane. The only other place I've had better cheese on a pizza was in Germany and they take their food seriously. We go here weekly and don't get me started on the ice cream. Apparently it's imported from Italy!!!! Wooooooow"}
{"text":"Fantastic ingredients, used in the right proportions, on each pizza make Inizio stand out. We have never had a bad pizza.  The pepperoni and sausage are great on various pies and the salads, particularly the caprese with buffalo mozzarella and balsamic glaze, are excellent."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give Inizio a better review but it was a miss for me.  The place is absolutely packed, at all times, which does say good things for the restaurant.  Where they went wrong is the speed of how the food is prepared to keep up with the demand.  I understand the pizza is cooked in 90 seconds but our dough was underdone and almost raw in places.  The second issue is the moisture on the dough; they are using fresh tomatoes (a good thing), but not cooked long enough to evaporate the liquid; it made our pizza really soggy.   The flavors are amazing and the service was excellent, but soggy pizza is not my cup of tea. Maybe we'll try them again when the newness of the location wears off"}
{"text":"Very selective menu but top notch ingredients. Special oven makes perfect crust which is thin in middle and crusty on edges. We tried margherita and other pizza with pistachio pesto. Both were perfect size and sauce. Liked the idea of hot sauce as condiments.    Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"I loved the feel of this place.  It was trendy, yet casual, down to earth and easy.  The pizza was awesome.  I loved the crust and I loved that it was ready in less than 5 minutes!  We tried the pepperoni and the margherita.  They were flavored very well and the red sauce was not too bitter or acidic, which I hate!  It wasn't too greasy, it wasn't too sloppy, it was the perfect crust and great flavoring.  It was fun to watch them literally create the pizza (dough and all) right in front of me.    I love the fact that you can buy a glass or bottle of wine while dining at one of their family-style tables and you can finish your meal with some of their scrumptious gelato.  Great addition to Charlotte.  The location isn't my favorite and wolfman pizza used to be in this exact location so that concerns me as far as their success is concerned.  But, I think they have what it takes to keep people coming back!  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Inizio has the highest quality authentic pizza in Charlotte. It has a great variety of flavors and the extra red sauce cup they give with each pizza is a great idea! The cannolis at Inizio are also delicious and fresh. Highly recommend for good pizza in Charlotte. It's a little bit pricier than other places around, but you get quality for the price."}
{"text":"Great service. Amazing pizza!! Pistachio is incred. Sea salt caramel gelato is to die. Wine is dank."}
{"text":"So I came here back in December and Yelp took my review down because, \"We typically remove reviews that look like they are written by someone who might have a relationship with the business that prevents them from writing a fair review (such as current or former employees, family members, or competing businesses), even if they describe firsthand experiences.\" **When I say my Dad found this place, I mean he's the one who introduced me to it. He isn't the founder of this establishment.   Major props to my Dad because he's the one who found, you know, reccomended, this place.  Honestly, the whole operation surprised me because I didn't know what to expect. One day, my Dad texted me saying have you been to Inizio Pizza yet? I responded saying, no, but we can go when you visit. Dad seemed pretty pleased with that answer. I didn't really think about Inizio until they visited this weekend.   To get in the pizza mood, I checked out their insta and the Yelp photos and I was really impressed. My Dad filled me in that their pizzas are made in 90 seconds because the wood fire oven that the 'zzas are cooked in is heated to 900 degrees. HOLY CRAP THAT IS HOT.   So, we get to Inizio. Super cute shopping center area in Dilworth. Easy to find parking and I was expecting a huge line and a long wait. WRONG. This must be on of the best-kept secrets or something because we walked up to the counter ordered and were able to find a seat with ease. We opted to sit outside, nice day. If you come in the evening and sit outside, they do have cafe lights!   Pizza comes in two sizes. The smaller size is perfect for two people. Opting for the classic Margherita pizza was the perfect choice for our first visit. Toppings were flowing. You have the option to add your own garlic and they bring you extra marinara for dipping sauce.   You can't leave this place without gelato or a cannoli. I got a small chocolate chip gelato. It was a crowd pleaser among the group. Next time, I will get getting the salted caramel. You better believe we will come back on a Thursday night for $2 gelato night. What a perfect date night idea!   TL;DR- great find, Dad! I didn't expect this place to be an order at the counter without a server type of place. After getting over that, I was excited to try the speedy za and was super impressed! We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"We were a little surprised to find out that we couldn't order our pizza over the phone, but quickly understood once we got there that our pizza would've been sitting and getting cold had we done that. They claim to have your pizza ready within a couple minutes of ordering, but it took them a little more than five minutes to get our pizza done the evening we came in. Still had no complaints about that because we much preferred to take home a piping hot, right out of the oven pizza. The margherita pizza was delicious and held up well on the trip home. It reminded us of the pizza we had in Rome years ago -  Nice thin crust that is both soft and crispy. It had a good amount of cheese on it, although I would've preferred a little more cheese but I do love love love cheese!  Where they fell short was with the Caesar salad. It was mostly Romaine lettuce with very little shaved Parmesan cheese and minimal croutons. We could hardly taste any of the Parmesan flavor and it definitely needed more croutons. I would've preferred a Panera Caesar salad over this, even with the Parmesan chips because you got actual Parmesan flavor.  We ordered a plain NY style cheesecake and a red velvet cheesecake, and enjoyed both. I preferred the plain, but my husband ate most of the red velvet. Both were very good! We'll definitely be back and next time we'll eat there. They had ample, open seating with a view into the kitchen. They had a few community tables with benches and some indivisible high tops. We may try one of the beers on tap, a different salad and the pistachio pizza was intriguing. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Welcome to the neighborhood Inizio!  Inizio Pizza's second location is a welcomed addition to the Dilworth neighborhood.  After several months watching the location be built, I was sure to be there Opening Night! And, have since been back a few times.  Inizio's offers a wide variety of Wood Fired Pizzas, as well as several appetizers, including salads, and desserts, including homemade cannoli's and gelato.  The location is a rustic, cool environment with several communal tables, high tops and patio tables outside under some amazing trees in Dilworth.  After placing your order at the counter, grab some water and condiments, salt and pepper, parmesan, red pepper flakes, etc. at a customer station and grab a seat. Within minutes your food, as well as drinks are delivered to you.  So far I have enjoyed the classic Margarita Pizza, the Raffaele (Sweet Peppers, Onion, Sausage and Mozzarella) and the Pistachio Pizza, as well as the Chocolate Chip Cannoli. I cannot tell you how amazing everything I have had is.  The Pzza crust is light and fluffy, but cooked to perfection. The toppings are just right, not too much and not too little. And, let me say definitely try the sausage, amazing!  You can definitely taste the love and freshness in what they are making. The staff is always friendly and service is spot on.  As I mentioned above, welcome Inizio's, it is a true gem for Dilworth!"}
{"text":"Very nice people and cute joint. Like how casual it was. That said, it was a bit pricy given its casual-ness. But the pizza was pretty unique and excellent. Got some kind of pistachio pizza. It was kind of a knee-jerk reaction because I love pistachios but the pizza, with pesto and other veggies too, was friggin delicious. So good."}
{"text":"Had a bad experience earlier today at another pizza shop and didn't eat the pizza. Glad we waited what a great pizza and great service. Every need was met and we loved the pizza. The place was very busy, but they kept them moving. Really good."}
{"text":"It's fine, but pretty boring pizza.  The crust is ok, wood firing it adds some flavor.  The sauce is very boring though. Cheese is ok.  The sausage was not Italian by any means, very bland.    The staff is pretty friendly though.  Service was good, and the manager talked to us and said if you don't love this pizza I'll buy it for you.  Claiming it was as good of a pie as you'd get in Italy.  When he came back and asked \"didn't I tell you?\" He got both of us going \"eh.\"     I didn't let him buy the overpriced pizza though, it wasn't terrible, we ate it.  But it just wasn't anything like what you get in Italy, let alone as tasty as wolfman used to be.  It's like trucraft pizza, it's fine, trendy but expensive for a boring meal.  He got us a cannoli, which was pretty tasty.  The place is nice inside, but I honestly don't get the rave.  It's nothing but plain Jane pizza.  If I'm paying that kind of money I expect great pizza, not eh."}
{"text":"They won't let you order and pick up. Nothing is fresh or local. Way overly priced. $60 for three people's lunch with no drinks. Wait was over thirty minutes. Exactly what we didn't want. Not worth it. Food was boring, plain and tasteless. Don't make me tell you about how rude the staff is... oh boy. Good luck!"}
{"text":"I must say, I wanted so badly this place to knock my socks off. After our dear palones closed, we have since scrambled to find good quality pizza. I went to inizos after work one day to get two pizzas to go. Took about 25 mins to get my order (doesn't it take 90 secs to cook these things?), even though it was 6 pm and they had maybe 5 people in the dining room. The pizza was sooo salty, almost unbearable. They will tell you it's from the prosciutto, but as a young man growing up in an Italian household, it's not supposed to be that darn salty. Crust was decent, not enough cheese or sauce. I might come back, but only if we had a coupon. Prices are not justifiable for the quality you receive."}
{"text":"Yum! A little (okay a lot) oily but very tasty bianco pizza today. Very good pie and a good size for their small is almost enough for two. Boxes easy and accessible for leftovers.  Free wifi was perfect and very helpful."}
{"text":"You cannot go wrong here! The pizza is excellent, and the staff is very friendly. We've been here twice and have yet to be even the slightest bit disappointed. Their pizza cooks in 90 seconds and is delivered to your table within minutes of ordering. We've gotten the margherita pizza both times and it's hand downs our favorite. Simple, yet overwhelming with flavor! This place beats every pizza place I've tried here in CLT and up the East Coast so far!"}
{"text":"We ordered the Italian Chopped Salad, Raffaele pizza and a Cannoli. The salad was good but pricey for the serving size. The pizza had absolutely no flavor except for the sausage on it. Chocolate Chip Cannoli was horrible...the cream was gritty and had no flavor either. The atmosphere is nice outside."}
{"text":"We just came in and the restaurant is empty.  Placed an order and 15 minutes later they had not even started.  The 7 people standing in the kitchen did not even realize there was an order.  AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS"}
{"text":"Very neat atmosphere! Very friendly staff! Loved the pistachio pizza! The margarita not so much, it was cold and had little to no cheese on it and the sauce made the crust mush and soggy ( wont be ordering that agin) The salads looked good that other people were eating. I definitely will go back to try some other things.   Have been back multiple times since my first review we pretty much go every Thursday. Still obsessed with the pistachio!! We had have had the sausage and broccoli rabe, delicious!! We get the salad with the peppers and cold cuts every time too, and everyone loves the 2.00 galati!!"}
{"text":"The pizzas are fantastic! There are so many great choices. But the lightness of the sauce and the flavor has made this our go to pizza place in Charlotte (besides take home from Papa Murphys)! I am so glad that I went in for the cannoli and stayed for the pizza!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is amazing!  The dough is delicious; thin where it should be with a thick and crispy yet chewy crust. Cheese is perfectly perfect. The crushed tomato sauce is fresh and simple. I was so impressed with this place. Flavor is on point. Cannoli is made to order and equally delish.  I want more!!!"}
{"text":"We just got home from Inizio, and I had to sing the praises of this restaurant and staff. The pizza was outstanding...true authentic Italian style pizza. No need for the extra stuff when you have quality ingredients and cooking methods. The manager, Robert, personally cooked our pizzas and checked on the food before we left. During this time, we had a great conversation and discovered that his passion for great pizza is part of the reason the food is so great. Impeccable food and service. A must visit in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Had been following on Instagram for quite a while before I made it in to try the pizza. No clue why I waited so long. Best Napoletana pizza I've had even though I haven't been to Italy to compare- I don't think I need to. The buffalo mozzarella is amazing as well. Pizzas are made in 90 seconds, so it's great to stop in for a quick lunch. Service was also on point."}
{"text":"So... I think now that Inizio has \"settled\" into the neighborhood, I went back... Still the same great space, just a different experience overall.    Not sure if I hit them on a bad night, but everyone seemed to be in a bad mood.  Yes- they did their job and provided me with pizza as promised, it just seemed like I was inconveniencing the cashier by putting my order in.  Really set the tone for the rest of the experience overall.  Pizza was the same as expected... cooked in 90 seconds and then delivered by a surly teenager (also in a bad mood that night).  It was cold that night so my friend and I took a table that seated six in the corner away from the door.  Later on, a larger group came in and sat at the other six-top next to us... and when their pizzas started coming out, they ran out of room since there were 6 of them... I felt the need to eat faster so they could use our table for over-flow.  Maybe serving the pizzas in these giant, table-sized baking trays isn't a great idea?  It also forces the issue about \"sharing\" which I have no problem... but I think my buddy thought I would start eating his pizza so he went to town (pizza horse racing anyone)....  just over all a weird, unpleasant experience that didn't really go down well with my slightly-over priced local brew.  My other complaint is that now that all the other tenants of the gorgeous new building have moved in, the parking is a bit of a nightmare.  You have a bunch of post-mates drivers parking illegally to get orders and a very tight parking space with people's over-sized vehicles.... not very fun.  So the one thing that is consistent is the pizza.  I'll give them that... it's just the other things that add up to a rather weird dining experience that I would rather avoid.  Also - FYI if you do order take-out... they recommend not slicing the pizza so that it \"travels better\"....  First time I've ever heard that... but sure(?).  I'm glad they do ask that they aren't going to slice it cause if you are headed to a party where there isn't a slicer, you would be in trouble."}
{"text":"Pizza was good. We had margarita with prosciutto. Caesar salad was not so good. I know I'm picky but I like my dressing homemade and I want hearts of romaine not the leafy part at the top of the romaine that most good restaurants would use as garnish. The pieces of lettuce were way to big and there was a scant amount dressing. Vibe was very chaotic. Seemed to be overall lack of management/customer service. Won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"The best pizza in Charlotte! I went to Inizio a week after coming home from Italy, and I could not believe how authentic their pizza is. Tasted just like the pizza I had in Naples. Even though it's a 25 minute drive from my house, I've already been three times. If you love authentic Italian, or just good pizza in general, you have to try Inizio!!"}
{"text":"Best wood fire pizza around!! Ask Eli for a tour! Crazy 1000 degree oven! Great atmosphere. Good beers on tap! A must try!!"}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best pizza I've ever had. They need to serve espresso or some sort of coffee. Should consider a better wine selection in general - a Chianti for sure and more by the glass options. Wine is apart of Italy's heritage."}
{"text":"Great pizza! We had the margarita with pepperoni and sausage, the pistachio pizza, and the italian chopped salad. The food in incredible here. The guy who brought our pizza (robert?) was awesome as well! My only complaint is that the $8 glass of wine I had was awful, and i noticed that the entire bottle only costs $4 once I googled the name. Cant go wrong with anything here, except a glass of the Montepulciano :P"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Friendly and informative staff. Comfortable family style tables with benches. You get to see all of the fresh ingredients right up front while they assemble your delectable pie! A few local, but well selected, Charlotte brews on tap. Great for date night or family outing. They also have a really neat patio that sits facing Park Rd. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Simply SUPERB.  As fresh, light, clean, and delicious as Pizza gets.  Period. There is no doubt that, within a very few months, this will be the place for The Best Pizza in Charlotte."}
{"text":"After eating Napoletana pizza at naples, I had been craving to eat authentic pizza for a while and none of the pizza places have been able to recreate the same magic. Inzio is as authentic as it gets. Even the gelato was amazing."}
{"text":"I've never eaten half of a 16\" pie that didn't leave me with that stuffed feeling from overeating. I'm sure in those situations I was happy and full, but still a bit uncomfortable from doing something so 'wrong'. When I got home from having dinner here, I noticed I didn't get that feeling. Possibly because the pizza has a light, yet absolutely delicious taste?   I'm not sure about the hows or the whys, I just know I waited too long to give this place a try. My date and I chose the pizza with the sweet peppers, mozzarella, onions and pecorino cheese. He doesn't eat pork, so we opted for no sausages. We tried to do half with sausage and half without, but that was not allowed strangely. Warning to any meat lovers- only pork selections are available. He was disappointed with that. I was unbothered since the New Yorker in me prefers my pizza cheese only, meat isn't a requirement on pizza. So he rolled with it for the evening. He enjoyed the pizza, despite the occasional grumbles of his 'vegetarian' meal.  It's a casual, yet well designed restaurant, fitting for the area. I've only been to a handle of pizza restaurants around town (shameful) but this one has to be one of the best."}
