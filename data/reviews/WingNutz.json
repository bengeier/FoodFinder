{"text":"I like there wings 
I recommend the southern honey BBQ for the wings and the traditional sauce. The buffalo chips and the regular chips are good. I recommend the regular and my family loved the Buffalo chips. The waiter we had was really nice and this place has tv's everywhere."}
{"text":"Love this place. The staff is great , the food is awesome , and the environment is clean and comfortable. The first time my wife took me here the waiter / bartender took probably 20 minutes of his time to go over all of the different sauces with us explain the benefits of each one as it compares to chicken or pork and let us taste a number of them before we decided which sauce we wanted to put on our food. He also gave us his personal recommendations about mixing a couple of the sauces together. He was extremely friendly and very professional. This first visit is one of the reasons that Wingnutz has become one of my favorite places to eat up here in the North Area. I have and will continue to recommend them to friends and family."}
{"text":"The worst wings place I have ever been to.  The staff was terrible and very unfriendly. They were more concerned with visiting with each other then tending to the guests.  The food was not good, it took almost 30 minutes to get (only three tables had guests) food and when we got it they did not bring out our entire order. Our buffalo chips (frys) came almost 15 minutes before the wings. The wings had very little sauce and were extremely dry. I would not recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"Great nachos! Great chicken. They are baked and tasty. The staff is really nice. A great place to go."}
{"text":"Chicken is good. The sauces were average. Sliced potatoes were under cooked. Customer service needs help. They didn't smile as if it's just another job. Last but not least it was over priced (12.99) for 6 unbreaded tenders smothered in BBQ sause and sliced taters. 
The set is great, inside outside sitting area. Plenty of TV's and beer to choose from. Perfect for an after work pit-stop or a small hang out."}
{"text":"Me and my buddy Matt went in today just looking for some lunch and what we got was so much more. The wings were delicious, the nachos were unbelievabe and the buffalo chips were off the charts. Not only was the food good but the beer selection was great! We're self-proclaimed beer buffs so the array of beers was a plus. We definitely plan on making it a a usual place"}
{"text":"Waited over 45 minutes for our food. Left because we were constantly being told 5 minutes more. Restaurant was just about empty do no excuses for this. We were told the service was slow but this was ridiculous. Never ever will we try this place again."}
{"text":"Food is awesome and they make their own beer! And it's a great place to watch sports too."}
{"text":"Being new to town my boyfriend and I decided we'd try this place. The staff was super friendly & the place was clean. We got our order to go. We were NOT impressed! The fries were......ehhh & the wings being baked just weren't as good as when you normally fry them. We weren't to impressed with the sauces either. I think we will stick with the normal wing chains."}
{"text":"Horrible Service! My husband stopped in and waited far too long to even be acknowledged until he had to ask Nicole at the bar for a menu who had a poor attitude about it, once asked. My husband was ready to order and over a lengthy period of time, he watched everyone BUT him be catered to. He finally asked Nicole to speak to a manager where he was informed there was a \"Supervisor\" available and when he said that's fine, she goes to the back to get him and left my husband standing there for over 5 mins without anyone coming out to talk to him so he just left. We will NEVER recommend this place nor will we be returning."}
{"text":"There was very good customer service and food. The sauce on the chicken is weird. Not bad but weird. Its texture is more watery than thick and sticky like most other sauces, but it has its own unique flavor which is very good. I thought it was going to be more like a fast food type of thing (I.e. panda express) where you just order and go, but its a restaurant. The prices are good as well. Overall I have no complaints."}
{"text":"This is my family's first and last time eating at this place. The staff was great but the food was absolutely horrible. I ordered $60 worth of horrendous foods. The chicken tenders I ordered with chipotle lime flavor with an extra kick was flavorless. The wings I ordered were flavorless. The cucumbers had this extremely old taste. My kids wouldn't even eat the plain cheese quesadilla and that's theyre favorite food! I'm so disappointed. For the amount of money I spent its all going to waste. I cannot force my family to eat this."}
{"text":"Amazing food and awesome craft beer selection. The staff are the bomb......able to answer questions and give great recommendations!"}
{"text":"Probably some of the best service and food I have ever had.  The wings were amazing and the beer was excellent.  I highly recommend this place if you want some good wings and beer."}
{"text":"Had dinner for the first time at wing nutz because my mom said it was a must try! Came in a boy was the food amazing! What I did notice tho was the service was the best part! Lindsey smiles and greeted everyone as they came in also served all tables and helped the people at the bar and made it look easy! Even tho the food was amazing Lindsey is probably the reason I will be returning! Thank you Lindsey for taking such pride in your job and making our first time such a great experience!"}
{"text":"Are here for the first time last night, so good!!! Nice waitress and the good was very good! It was very dark in there though, made it hard to read the menu."}
{"text":"Wings were great! Only reason I don't give 5 stars is because there bar doesn't have a great liquor selection. ;)"}
{"text":"Never had baked wings before and after my experience at Wing Nutz I will have them again. The service was very friendly and laid back. There were several beers on tap. Beautiful big screen tvs. The hog wings were extremely good. The parmasean curry sauce was delicious. The wings were very tasty with the honey BBQ and garlic chili sauces. Top notch experience and I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Very good, food was delicious and the waitstaff was very nice and helpful. Nice selection of beers."}
{"text":"I can't complain about the food.  The food was excellent and they had a decent selection of beers that I had never heard of.  The service was a little slow.  My waitress was friendly; however, she got caught up in a conversation with the bartender and forgot to bring out the food.  I ended up waiting for a while (an hour and a half) for my food to come out, and some random person in the back brought it to me.  She apologized, but I didn't think that was good service.  Keep in mind, I was the only customer in there..."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews I decided to try wing nutz out. I was so disappointed my food was burned so badly I had to throw it in the trash literally 30.00 wasted"}
{"text":"Wow this is the best bar food I have ever had! It's fresh and delicious, not greasy. Even my husband couldn't stop raving about it all the way home. The Buffalo fries mixed hot and regular with ranch was to die for. I don't even like fries and I was sorry we didn't order the large. Also he got the  buffalo blue burger it was amazing and we tried 8 boneless wings. Jamaican Jerk and traditional hot again with ranch yummy. Beer selection is really good. Hubby loves his ipa and there was plenty for me ciders etc. I can't wait till Bloody Mary's on Sunday!! So happy these guys are here not enough great fresh places on this side of town. Much success, I want you to stick around.   :)  Oops hubby just reminded me how much he loved the side salad. Lol"}
{"text":"All baked menu, the food is delicious. Their beer selection is great. If you like darker beers, they have a selection of very good craft beers including one particularly delicious nitro porter. They also have your typical selections, bud light miller lite and a cider on tap as well. You can get a bunch of different sauces on your wings or if youre not feeling wings they have a ton of other good stuff, the turkey burger is what my wife always gets, she loves it. The service is always great, staff is always on top of it making sure drinks are full and food is perfect. Watching a game here is awesome, they have 2 massive tvs over the bar, and they play the sound unlike a lot of bars here in town."}
{"text":"We were looking for a new wing spot close to the Centennial area. We checked out the reviews on yelp and the yelp community gave this new restaurant four stars. 

We had high hopes for this restaurant but it epically failed. 

When you are wanting and craving wings,  you are expecting deep fried and crunchy smothered with tons of yummy sauce. This restaurant does not have any deep fryers in it at all. EVERYTHING IS BAKED! 

When you cook everything in an oven, sometimes food drips off the pan and winds up on the bottom of the oven. This causes the drippings to burn and creates a lot of burnt smoke in the oven... just like if you were cooking at home. 

So... basically almost everything tasted burnt! 

We were the only ones there and it took 45 minutes for our food. I ordered the regular french fries/chips and the grilled southwest chicken wrap. My boyfriend ordered the regular boneless wings and the pork wings.

Honestly my wrap was really good. The wings lacked flavor and didn't have that nice crunch to it that wings that are deep fried have. All of our french fries had that burnt taste smell and the server even brought us new ones... but nothing changed. 

I wouldn't recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"The wings were okay; the Caribbean Jerk was runny and the Chipotle Lime was good. The wings were soft and not very meaty. I wouldn't go out of my way to go there. The bar needs more Las Vegas local beers."}
{"text":"Awesome wings and pork shanks, yes pork shanks. Great sauces or go naked and dip'em. Wasatch Beers on tap. Lindsay is the Best too."}
{"text":"Military discount? Yes!
Awesome food? Yes...loved the wings...I like boneless more than bone-in, but I forgot to tell them that when ordering, so I got traditional wings.
Would go again!
I did go again. I reduced the rating to a 3 solely based on price and quantity--I thought they should give one more boneless wing for the price! The food is good though!"}
{"text":"The service was good but the buffalo chips were burnt and the wings are nothing special. the \"hot\" is not hot it's like eating straight red hot so I don't think I'll be going back"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my visit. The Buffalo chips were awesome. I loved the backed boneless chicken wings. So glad they aren't deep fried. Not much of a happy hour menu.  I felt like I paid way to much for a glass of wine. I liked the closeness and small business feel. But there was games on every TV and no sound for any of them. Service was good. I would go back and just order water. When I asked my husband what he thought he said he wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Worst service, didn't even give me one refill. The fries were a little burnt and I was not treated like valued customer. Like do you want a tip or not?"}
{"text":"Took about 40 minutes to get an order to go we order 20 hog wings which were over priced. Then they said that they came out small and they were making extra so waited another 20 minutes for about three little pieces. Flavor was good but over priced and too long of a wait there was only one person in the front and it looked like only one in the back!"}
{"text":"Kevin is amazing. He has excellent customer service and is overall fantastic. The food was delicious.  Wings were so good and my burger was to die for.  Every time I come to Vegas from now on I will come to Wing Nutz, totally worth the drive. I can honestly say this is the best wing place I have ever been too."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night it was pretty busy but we didn't have to wait that much. We got chips and salsa and the salsa is made there and you can tell! It's good. The wings and sauces are pretty yummy. I loved the fact that they're baked and not fried! Plus you get veggies w your order. The guy Deval, took care of us and man, he really knows what customer service is! Very friendly and informative, the other ladies there could learn something from him, they looked lazy and had no personality. Hope they do well. Their food is good."}
{"text":"\"A\" for effort. Not impressed with the food. They tried...honestly some foods are just meant to be unhealthy. They don't fry anything which is fine...I wouldn't expect the same texture knowing this but none of their chicken in breaded just FYI. 

I ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich and normally this would come breaded anywhere else. I thought it would come breaded too...just baked. Well, the sandwich was okay. Didn't taste like buffalo sauce at all. I'm assuming because it's not breaded that it's hard to hold the flavor of the sauce. It also came with marinated tomatoes on top which were gross. 

My husband ordered the boneless wings which typically are breaded too. He said the sauces were good but the chicken was dry and also the chicken doesn't hang on to the flavor of the sauces because they aren't breaded. 

The buffalo chips were burned. The children's quesadilla pitiful and also tasted burnt probably because it was all baked together and burned together. 

The water wasn't even good. It tasted like straight from a well and not in a good way. 

The only reason we gave it 3 stars is because the service was good and friendly and there isn't a bad seat in there if you came to watch a game. 

Will we come back? Nope. Sadly the food isn't good enough to return."}
{"text":"I'm not the biggest fan of wings, but I loved Wing Nutz's wings! They have baked wings and have a wide selection of different sauces. I think I've tried all of their regular menu sauces and my favorite is the Southern Lemon Hotties. Their spicy buffalo chips are a must have with your lunch and dinner. Also, if you're in a mood for something lighter and healthier than wings, they have some good salads.

I'm not a beer drinker, but everyone I go with to this place loves the Ghost Rider beer. So I recommend that one!

I go here a few times a month. They have music bingo on Friday nights (8pm) and trivia on Wed nights. I haven't tried the trivia night, but I have tried the music bingo twice. It was so much fun, and they gave out decent prizes (free beer and beer glasses). I also enjoy going here to watch football and other sports. They have a lot of TVs."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good but the waiter seemed overwhelmed and took forever to get us our check.  Also witnessed someone who sat outside get forgotten about."}
{"text":"The service is great. The guy that usually waits on us is always super friendly and helpful. This place offers a unique spin on the classic chicken wing. I love that everything is baked. I actually feel satisfied when leaving instead of feeling like I drank a gallon of grease for lunch/dinner. 

They have an option called the \"oink and cluck combo\" that my husband LOVES. You guessed it! Chicken and pork wings in one meal. The buffalo chips are delish and the kids meals are huge. My very picky three year old loves the chicken quesadilla meal with vegetables. Strange, I know."}
{"text":"The worst wings I have ever had. Clumps of souse on them not evenly distributed and cold at that. Who puts cold sauce on wings? Bartender was cool beer was good \"Wings\" are the main campaign and they completely failed on them."}
{"text":"We love to go here.  My boyfriend and I love chicken wings but they're terrible for you.  These are grilled, not fried! And the sauce is the boss here.  They have happy hour which is awesome.  It's a cozy little place with a bar and flat screens.  I'm sure we will be back for some baseball games! :)"}
{"text":"I will admit, waiting 45 minutes to get our food that was served cold makes it hard for me to rate this place much higher. The food is ok, but it's not great. When we told our server this was our first visit to Wing Nutz she said nothing. No suggestion, nothing. She was knowledgeable about the menu and she did answer our questions. It was lunch time and it didn't seem too busy, but everything just took too long. Drinks came out slow, ordered chips & salsa which was good, but the portion was small & it took a long time to come out as well. We ordered mixed buffalo chips (half regular/half spicy). They were good, but they were mixed together, and the wife & kids aren't find of spicy stuff, so picking the regular ones out was a challenge. I or greed spicy chipotle wings. They were good but cold. I'm assuming they were sitting somewhere based on how long it took us to get our food. I may try take out again, or maybe dinner & not lunch, but I was not impressed."}
{"text":"Beyond awful service! Went in on 6/21 and service was awful. First off the restaurant was so hot and smokey inside. We had to ask 3 times for water. He kept forgetting to bring it, mind you it was so hot inside. The people working were sitting in the bar area eating. Food was ok, nothing special. Waited and waited for any type of refills or to check on us. Took forever to get the check and then they over charged us. This place isn't worth eating at."}
{"text":"Last night this place looked like a business on the brink of closing. We got there around 7:30 on a Saturday night and there was only one other party in the whole place. Our last experience had been great at Wing Nutz so I was surprised.

A young waitress came over and began service. Soon we discovered that they were out of the boneless pork wings, the featured beer and several other draft beers.. my primary reason for going there. The remaining draft selection wasn't what we were looking for.

We also ordered a large chips appetizer and got a small. The wine served was vinegarry (new word) and had clearly not been stored properly. The bone-in pork wings were well prepared nonetheless but tell me again why I am paying $22 for 10 pork wings when a full rack of pork ribs is less than $20 most places???

The whole time we were there one other party came and went. We probably won't be back after this and I'm not so sure that it will be there anyway."}
{"text":"This place was good but not great. My husband and I went in to grab some take out dinner and the servers were very friendly but the prices were a little bit high. I know of a few wing restaurants with better deals and come with more food. We got the sampler for $24.99 but didn't come with much for the price and the sauces were light but everything tasted good. My husband got the 64 fl oz growler but way pricy compared to 5 bottles of beer. I think I liked the spicy buffalo chips the best. Overall not bad. They also forgot to put our buffalo chips in the bag so I had to go back, but that wasn't a big deal, mistakes happen."}
{"text":"Very Classy, Professional. Great staff, Craft, Draft Beer. Belgium, German. Zwie Bieren Bitter."}
{"text":"Carlos our bartender was stellar, Hard working man behind the bar. 
Excellent service  
Food was perfection! Beyond good! The curry flavor and the southern honey BBQ were heavenly !! A must try !!"}
{"text":"Their bone in wings are the best in town....their boneless are horrible!!! Waitress was nice and the cook even came out and asked us how the wings were. We will be back for the traditional wings soon!"}
{"text":"The setting of the restaurant was great! The wings however were not. The flavor isn't strong enough and they are too soft!"}
{"text":"We made two visits to here and will not return. For one, the food was inconsistent. The first time we came and tried the chicken nachos, they were amazing, lots of sauce and toppings. The second time, they were gross, dry and pretty much just a bunch of chips with nothing on them. The wings were great, had no complaints about them.  The biggest thing that got me though, was the management. They have signs on every table advertising to download their app on your phone, so I did. On their app, they gave a coupon section with a 10% off coupon, all you have to do is scam a qr code! So when our waitress came back, I asked what qr code I needed to scan and she went on to tell me that it should have been on the flyer advertising the app, but their location hadn't received those papers yet. She continued to tell me that her manager was the lady sitting over there at the end of the bar and that she would go ask if she would be able to give the discount. Needless to say, when she came back, the manager said that they would be unable to take the coupon. Why would you advertise for something you won't even accept!? We had signed up for your loyalty program, downloaded the app, and had planned on making this our new place to go for wings, yet you're willing to lose customers over poor customer service and not giving a tiny discount. Not very good for a newly opened restaurant."}
{"text":"This is not a four star restaurant as it is rated on Yelp. This is just a nice place to watch a game. There are big TV monitors inside. The service is very slow and prices are too high according to the food they serve. The stuff was not attentive at all. Food came out very slow: took them about 45 minutes.  Everything is baked, not fried. I had regular wings, they were baked, but they were not done well. The wings were not well seasoned. The food tasted as if it was thawed improperly. The sauces were not good enough. 
Our drinks came out very slow. EVERYTHING HERE WAS SLOW....."}
{"text":"Great! Great! Great! Great! Ambiance!!!! Love he food and love the service. It's a clean local joint that is easy to access. The beer is cold and the food is hot. 
I love the 60 inch TV's and surrounded with games. 
I love sports theme!!!!"}
{"text":"Great wings and great service!   Lots of TVs to watch the game.  Wings are baked so you don't get that greasy feeling.  Nice selection  of sauces and beers."}
{"text":"This is my first time writing a review on Yelp. But I couldn't choose a better place to rant and rave about for my first review. To start off, this isn't my first visit, and I have meant to post on here before, but leaving always having such a great experience I keep forgetting! 

The first thing on my list is customer service. Coming from the industry myself, this either makes or breaks whether or not I will return. My first trip was about four months ago, and walking in was pleasantly surprised by the large bar, outside seating and two large tv's for FOOTBALL!!! Kevin was the first bartender that helped me. Not only was he able to make a friend and I laugh the whole time, but he also handled all other guests as well. I was impressed. The second trip was with Lindsy, and she was equally impressive! Both Lindsy (correct spelling btw)  and Kevin remember my group and my names and drinks and past orders. This is awesome! If I forget the combo of sauces they remember for me. No they don't have to ask if I want ranch or blue cheese, they know I want the blue cheese!!! They also have a great bartender/cook/server...he does it all, John. He is wonderful every time as well. All three of the lovely people do it all as well. 

Now for the food. Not if the service wasn't great enough, the food just tops off the whole experience! First of all, I am working of changing out my diet and eating healthier. This is not the first reason I came in here. A friend said it was great and I tagged along. But they bake all of their wings, they do not use any fry oil. Which is awesome. Anyways, the food, first time I came in I got the oink and cluck, which is a mix of wings, pork shanks and your choice of side. I'm not going to lie, I have had the same thing of just wings every time because they are so good! My friends have eaten the burgers or wraps and I've had a bite and it's always awesome. The buffalo chips are hand cut potatoes, in either spicy buffalo or plain and I get a mix of both. Kevin helped me with my first order of picking sauces. The sauce options are endless and they are all made on location. I have had all different kinds of sauces, but my favorites now are lemon hotties on the wings and a mix of jalapeño honey bbq and raspberry chipotle, they call it Halle Berry.  

I could go on about this place for days, but all I can say is...try this place out. If you like wings and great craft beer choices, liquor, amazing food and service you will be happy! I know I was, and am! 

Basically 5 stars, period the end!"}
{"text":"This I one of the best chicken wing places iv ever had! The food is all baked which makes you feel better about eating it! I work just next door and waited long time for them to open and now that they are open I want to eat there everyday! Food is amazing and staff is so friendly!"}
{"text":"So this place is tucked away in the corner and you don't notice it. But they had a trailer, one of the catering ones parked out in front of Walgreens. Seen it for months but then it was gone.

The pork rib ends with teriyaki sauce was pretty good. There wings were kinda different. They bake all there foods trying to be healthier. I like crispy so I guess it works for me.

It wasn't busy but they are in a bad location."}
{"text":"My first impression was good. I was greeted promptly by the server that eventually took my order, however I did have to wait a while for my order to actually be taken ! Though they weren't very busy, it was some time before my single order to go was brought out ! 
  I briefly spoke to a gentleman that appeared to be working there. (I later found out he was the manager's husband) He was very short with his responses to my questions almost as if I was bothering him ! 
   Though the majority of the reviews I had read indicated the food was remarkable, on my visit this was not the case ! I ordered the \"oink & cluck\" dinner. This dinner was comprised of 5 wing \"sections\", 2 hog shanks, (obviously from a very small hogs) and a portion of \"buffalo chips\" ! 
   I proceeded home (5 minutes away) and immediately sat down to enjoy my first dinner at Wing Nutz ! The dinner was cold ! The wings at maybe room temperature and the small portions of hog shank slightly warmer ! The buffalo chips were cold and obviously cooked at separate times with half being slightly burnt and dried out and the other half only cooked half way and limp !! 
   At Wing Nutz they charge a whopping $1.00 per wing \"section\" ala carte !!! That is higher than anywhere I have experienced in the country ! The plate I ordered above was $12.87 with the tax !! My first thought after I ate was that I had been robbed !!!! I took the time to post this only for those who can't afford to throw their money away !!"}
{"text":"Eh... My husband was pretty happy with his bbq and lemon pepper wings. My daughter was less than thrilled with her boneless wings and my chicken wrap was just ok. The potato chips had a burnt taste. Also the spicy ones were way too spicy. I would eat here again if I had to. But not by choice."}
{"text":"First time there.. First thing to mention that I wouldn't have not known from the outside is that they have a great bar with great specials including 2.00 margaritas all day long. Wings were great, lots of menu choices. Great service. Gluten free choices both for food and beer. Not just a wing place. Salads and sandwiches. Loved the garlic chili sauce."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I waited for this place to open. When it did we were amazed at how great everything was laid out. It's a very warm place with plenty of TVS to watch sports and enjoy a beer and some BAKED wings. Yes Baked. There is a good variety of sauces to choose from an gluten free indications as well. The menu is very well thought out and there is also patio seating with a roll door to open up the inside dining area. This place is a great addition to the area."}
{"text":"Sadly, tonight's service doesn't make the grade.  One server, one cook, one someone else, not sure what he is doing.  Waited 40+ minutes for wings. Not checked on before or after food arrived.  This place is a prime candidate for some hospitality management improvements.  A Ziosk machine would speed up at least the back end of the process.  Probably only one more visit to see if this was a fluke, or if the new normal for WingNutz."}
{"text":"Been a customer for Friday night music bingo since I moved here almost a year...tonight the MC changed...service was slow...we come come in every week with a table for 6-10 people and tonight the prizes were being redeemed in a different way and when we asked management they were very rude....I offered to just pay my and for get the prize.. manaho wanted to continue to argue with me....on top of that I had family from out of town visiting ...after I said how much fun we would have...I'm done with Wing Nuts...sad I love to support small businesses."}
{"text":"First time we visted, all the wings and sides tasted great. The second and third time we visted we requested extra sauce on our orders of 44 wings (like we had done the first time) and they was barely any sauce. Very difficult to eat chicken wings when they are dry. We will not be returning. Off to Buffal Wild Wings!"}
{"text":"Cold beer and hot wings! What more could you ask for? I loved the baked wings and the variety of sauces. HUGE TVs and great service. Love Wing Nutz!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place today.

Despite what you may think about baked wings, the food here was delicious. 
We decided to have the WingNutz sampler, which consisted of 6 bone-in wings, 6 boneless, 4 hog wings, and a double order of their chips. 
The baked chips were delicious. Crispy on the outside, yet still soft on the inside. With great seasoning.

For me, the wings were good. Not spectacular blow the competition away good, but they were good. What was super delicious though was the hog wings. They were so good.

Our service was great, but then there were only 4 other tables, so I'd have to wait to pass judgment on that until I can see how they are at a busier time.

Overall tho, a welcome addition to the options for wings in the area."}
{"text":"I am a raving lunatic for this place for the beer selection alone.  They have the GREATEST craft beer selection I have seen in Las Vegas.  They carry mostly Squatters and Wasatch beer brands on tap.  I have been on  a big IPA kick lately and they were able to satisfy my thirst.  One of favorites is the Double Hop IPA super potent and can contain +9% alcohol content for one beer.  Its like drinking to Budwiser at once.  POW! Lets get the night started.  

They also have a point system that you can earn if you enroll in the text loyalty program.  After 1000 points you get your own personal mug for future visits.  Lets see if we can earn a mug tonight. Who wants to go. I got the first round!

I did not try the food. Maybe next time."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delish.  Love the concept of no breading and everything baked. Had garlic chili..curry and traditional flavors and were sooooo good and the buffalo chips were amazing!  Service is turtle slow with food but one has to understand it's all baked not fried so does take time.  We live on other side of town but defo worth coming back"}
{"text":"Love the Hog Wingz here but I always order our food to go, been here 4 times now and EVERYTIME theyve gotten our order wrong in one way or another. Today it was that we ordered our wings boneless and tossed (in sauce) and got bone in and were not tossed in sauce and waitress REFUSED to take them back to toss. Said once they come out of the kitchen they cant take them back in. For 10 hog wings they gave us 2 souffle cups of sauce and charge $0.99  for any additional.  Ridiculous. Weve come to expect the mistakes, just the price you pay for hog wing heaven but today was the 1st time they were rude and refused to fix it. Dissapointed #wingNutz"}
{"text":"Once again horrible service. The gentleman working the pickup area could really use a lesson in how to speak with the people spending money in the establishment that employs him. My wife went in and had a small issue with her order and instead of just saying hey no problem we can easily fix that he wants to talk down and berate people. When asked for the manager he stated he was but yet can't process a refund? Last time we will ever patronize this joke of a establishment."}
{"text":"The wings are so-so. The chicken was little tough. Not fried, so it was a nice change. Although the staff ONLY 2 people was friendly and hardworking, the service was horrible. Long wait to order, long wait to get your order and long wait to get a water refill. One table was even forgotten to be served. They still patiently waited for their food to come out. Which was very nice of them. I do have to admit, I loved the Wing Nutz Nachos... I recommend you try it. The Buffalo Chips had a great spice on them but it was soggy. Drown it with Ranch and it's suddenly heaven. So overall, it was an okay experience. I gave it a 3 stars because the staff of 2 worked hard to serve a full house."}
{"text":"First I must say I was pleasantly surprised by how good this place was. This place does not fry anything which I find awesome. I am trying to eat healthier but who can blame me for a hotwing craving?! This place is kind of hidden in a corner otherwise I think it would be a big hit! We got an appetizer to start they advertise fresh everything so what better way to test this theory then the southwest chips and salsa loaded with fresh veggies. I must say it was great had just enough kick and boy was it fresh yum yum!!! Beside the hot wings which we obviously got we also wanted to try the hog wings (pork shanks). We got them in the southern honey BBQ sauce. The meat was cooked to perfection, juicy and tender. For the wings I got bone in the two flavors I chose were southern hottie's and Jamaican Jerk. The jerk was like a typically jerk except not as sweet as your average buffalo wild wings sauce. Alo the southern hotties sauce was a traditional franks hot sauce but with more flavor and tasted peppery. The chicken was delicious, again for bake I was surprised at how juicy it was. Also the chicken wings were a decent size. The only change I would make would be extra sauce; even just on the side as there's was a tad thin. Great great healthy option for someone craving wings, I will be back."}
{"text":"I can't say that this was really really good. It was good but it was a little bit pricey for what we ordered. 

Plus, for some reason the seasonings didn't really stick to the chicken too well, I'm not sure if it was because it was just not marinated long enough? 

We had to leave right away, but what I did like was the fries, I don't remember what they were called but they were like chips but fries, very Delish!"}
{"text":"The food was well above average and the waitress was friendly and good. However,  the restaurant was under staffed.  One waitress was manning the bar AND the restaurant.  Eventually someone from the back came to help (maybe the dishwasher or the cook?) But it was too late. A few tables had walked out already."}
{"text":"I visited this place 2 years ago & had an amazing experience with Kevin. Came in last night & it was complete opposite. Amber was our waitress, my girlfriend & I are both gluten free, I first asked for what gluten free beers you carried because I remember having Estrella Damm there & of the 2 gluten free options she didn't know the names. We ordered Southwest Buffalo Chips pico on the side spicy as our app & boneless wings for the main course. The boneless wings came out before the buffalo chips & Amber said that our app was coming that the cook is having an off night & put pico on our app, we said that was fine. When they came out there was onion & random tomato pieces in our buffalo chips there was no spice at all & when we asked Amber about our order she got very defensive & said, \"Well I didn't put the spice since y'all are gluten free, so I was looking out for y'all!\" Ummmm without letting us know this, my girlfriend thanked her & she rolled her eyes & walked away without saying a word! The potatoes tasted like some kind of oil or gas but after waiting so long & being so hungry I had to force myself to eat them. We then asked for a manager due to her attitude & as we are explaining what was going on she was behind the \"cook, manager, supervisor\" (we aren't sure who he really was) screaming over us trying to defend herself. It was sooooo unprofessional. He then got irritated with us & said he would take care of the bill but that's not at all what we were looking for, if we wanted a free meal we could have ate at home & got better service! The bill that she dropped on our table had nothing that we ordered on it so your inventory might be off! I will never come back to this establishment!"}
{"text":"The wings were great! I didn't even miss the deep fried-ness. I got the traditional wings and they were cooked to crispy perfection. I also got some \"oinkers\" (jalapeño BBQ) and they literally fell off the bone! So good! Beer selection was phenomenal! Ilon was our server and he was kind, courteous, and knowledgeable of the menu! Can't wait to come back and watch some games!"}
{"text":"Would never come here again! As u huge wing fan, I came here only to be extremely disappointed their wings are tasteless, no flavor. Boring! And extreamly over priced!!"}
{"text":"Everything is baked, not fried! I love the atmosphere of this place. Great service! Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"We LOVE wings.  Told waitress it's our first time trying their food: Wings are baked and sauces are different.  So I asked the waitress if I could taste the sauces in mild so I can make a decision. She said \"they won't let you try all of them.\" I asked if it is that difficult to have a plate of seven dots and she tells me that \"they won't give handouts like that.\"  She proceeds to tell me about how money works and that \"they\" would lose money handing out samples to everybody\". Obviously we left. It's too bad that she is the first face to meet the patrons; we, who will never even make the drive out there again.  BTW they had only two other parties having lunch at 12:30 in the afternoon. 
Had a delicious meal at Cafe Rio instead."}
{"text":"Service: the girls working was friendly and pretty fast to get our order in. 

Food: the food was good for the most part. I enjoyed the chips my chicken came with they were very yummy, I also like that you could do half spicy chips and half regular chips. My chicken tasted like it had been warmed up in the the microwave, my husbands on the other hand did not so I am not sure how it is prepared or maybe it was the sauce I chose but maybe I will try something different next time. We will try this place again."}
{"text":"The food tasted not so great, as if it was frozen and warmed up. Most of it was burned, I had to wait to pick up because there was no host or waiter up front. Sucks- I love wings and so close to work. Oh well"}
{"text":"It's been a few years since my last review and after our experience last night, I decided it was time for an update. 
We used to frequent WingNutz on a pretty much weekly basis but have fallen off. Last night we decided to give them a try again. I ordered the chicken nachos, just like in my last review. Our server came back and mentioned that I could get the cheese nachos from the happy hour menu for cheaper, and I said no because I wanted all the toppings. But this time, there was no chicken on my nachos. I ate them anyway because I was starving and our sever didn't come back. My drink ran empty and our server never came to offer us refills. In fact we didn't see her again until she brought the bill. The service has definitely gone down hill, and I remembered why we haven't been back. The restaurant wasn't busy at all so there wasn't an excuse as to why our table would have been neglected. Another thing is that they have a rewards system and you are supposed to put your phone number on the receipt. We have done this every time, and like I said we used to come here weekly. We never seemed to gather any rewards for all the times we visited. Last night my husband even said that he wasn't going to bother putting his number on it because we never got rewards. Sorry WingNutz, but you're definitely out of our regular rotation for now. I'm bummed because we used to really love coming here. Hopefully they'll start working on some improvements."}
{"text":"Plenty of variety with sauces and all their wings are baked instead of fried. Their own draft beers (Nut Job Ales), perfection. Sampler platters are awesome here."}
{"text":"Man... I gotta say... I LOVED this place. First of all, my husbie and I were starving around midnight and it was the only place open even remotely close to Summerlin, so we ordered through Uber Eats. We got 2 small orders of bone in wings - Caribbean Jerk and Jalapeño BBQ I think it was, and an order of chips and salsa. The food arrived super quickly, in fact we went to pick up beer at an Albertson's, like 2 min away and had to race back. Met the driver right as we pulled into our street. So, big plus for both of these businesses for hustling so late! 

We stuffed our little faces, re-watching 2001 Space Odyssey. We were DYING from the jalapeño bbq heat and were hella confused by the movie because he vaped some grade A+ cannabis and I probably got a contact high. So, all in all, the wings were the BOMB, sauces were the BOMB, blue cheese was creamy and delish. Only issue: we got like 15 chips (counted) with the salsa. Huge bummer, I must admit. But, other than that, we had an awesome, awesome, spontaneous and late night treat. Thank you Wing Nutz!! :)"}
{"text":"In love with this place. Only thing missing is sunshades for those wonderful Las Vegas sunsets!!!"}
{"text":"How in the world is this place not five stars!

As an out of towner I came in for lunch and was greeted instantly.  The bar had lots of flat screens and cleverly decorated.  I choose to sit at the bar and was able to get some tips from the bar tender.  

I ended up getting sharing the sampler with traditional legendary wings, southern lemon hottie boneless wings, jalepeño honey bbq hog wings (pork), and a side of buffalo chips.  Everything absolutely awesome.  I love the variety of sauces.  The wings were cooked to perfection - baked wings so the wings aren't fried and greasy.  And the hogs wings were absolutely surprisingly delicious.  The buffalo chips had a tasty seasoning with a kick to it.  I washed it down with their signature Nut Job Beer, Over the Moon White Belgium.  It is great if you are looking for something light and smooth but tasty to wash down the spice.

This place as way more variety and flavor than you average/common wing spot.  If you are looking for fattening deep fried, greasy wings, this place isn't for you.  If you are looking for delicious wings to tickle and spice your taste buds and a great atmosphere to have a meal, give this place a try."}
{"text":"The service was outstanding!!!!!! The food recommendations were Perfect and Delicious!! I will be back and I will let my friends & family know about this place. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"This place won't last 1year. First,  way over priced. I ordered a family meal for three, we only get two (tiny) ranches and they want to charge us for another. I can name 50 chicken wing resturaunts  that are cheaper and better, (my kids said the Costco frozen ones were better). In addition they barely put any sauce in the wings. Almost as if they are already pinching pennies to stay open. What a waste of $50. ( for a total of 25 wings and 1lb of potato fries). The potato fries were very good that's why I gave them one star"}
{"text":"My GF and I had just gone to Aliante casino and after a pretty late night movie decided to get wings. There's a competitor right across the street from this place but they close earlier. So our choice was made.

We ordered one of their sampler platters that gave us 2 different choices of wings (1 sauce for the bone in and 1 sauce choice for the boneless), 'hog wings' and buffalo chips.

The server was very patient with us as this was our first time there. Definitely appreciate that. He was a cool guy who kept my beers coming and her water cup filled. 

The food was very good. These aren't your average fried wings. They're baked so the flavor of the sauce reslly sticks to the wing.

My traditional wings were very good but can't say I cared for my girlfriend's lemon pepper boneless wings. The flavor on those was very overpowering. 

Buffalo chips were delicious and the pork shanks aka hog wings tasted like yummy pork belly.

Definitely will try again."}
{"text":"These are the best wings in the Vegas area. As a hot wing conniseur and voted best hot wing chef in the metro Denver area by the Rocky Mountain News I can say these wings are amazing with premium quality fresh chicken and sever unique and delicious sauces. The atmosphere is relaxed, the staff is friendly, and the draft beer selection does not leave one wanting for more."}
{"text":"Good food! Nice sports-club ambiance with multiple TVs and such.

Came here on a Tuesday afternoon, visiting Vegas from out of town, and ordered 12 wings (Jamaican jerk and raspberry chipotle) , mixed chips, and chips and salsa.

Wings - very good. Raspberry chipotle was nice and our favorites. Jamaican jerk could have used more kick.

Chips - nice crunch, soft on the inside like a fry. Never had anything like it before

Chips and salads - good, salsa was nice but kind of skimpy on the chips ($1.50 for a refill? Yeah right!)

Customer service - waiter was prompt and nice. 


Overall: solid sports bar but not spectacular - imagine this place would be nice to watch a game. Did not try the beers but looked like there was a nice craft selection."}
{"text":"I know. It's just wings right? Wait till you have these BAKED wings with all the flavor options. BOMB!!!"}
{"text":"The food isn't too good and neither is the service.  If you're coming for beer and to watch a game then this is the place.  Lots of TVs and not too crowded.  But go to wing stop because food is gross."}
{"text":"The staff is so friendly and our server had the best attitude. She was friendly had a great smile and also grabbed us and greeted us in from Panda Express next door. Lindsay was awesome!!! She really is the reason why we came in and seriously walked us tgrought the menu and how it all worked. Must go!!!"}
{"text":"The food is good and consistent and the spicy potato chips are awesome.  They seem to rotate beer taps every so often which is another plus.

The place always appears to be clean and the staff has been friendly, so it's definitely worth going back for."}
{"text":"Awesome wings and ribs. I like the fact that the wings are baked. Great experiences every time."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a shot last night, and I'm glad I went.  This wing joint is what Buffalo Wild Wings should be like.  The wings are better and there Micro Brews/house beers are amazing. The restaurant was a little small but I found my new hang out spot for the NBA playoffs."}
{"text":"Was a bit overpriced and the sweat tea tasted funny, my daughter's nachos were burnt and so were some of my fries/chips. The wings were ok at best. We weren't thrilled about the service either which was a shame since we were the ONLY table in the joint at the time. Sorry but we won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Awesome wings and great staff. Better than bww I think. I will definitely be back. The curry parmesan was great and the garlic ones were great too. Mom had the teriyaki burger and said it was the best."}
{"text":"I really like this place. if it's your first time just make sure you say you want your wings wet trust. If not you will not have the same experience"}
{"text":"The nachos were alright. Tasted like the cheese was microwaved on top. Wasn't crunchy at all. Wings flavors were good. Nothing extraordinary though. Chill atmosphere. Not very big. There were a couple of good waiter/waitresses but unfortunately ours was not one of them! Our waitress didn't come back to check on us or refill drinks. Probably because we saw three or four of them lined up at the bar taking shots. Had to flag down another waitress. She was nice! Wish I could give names but no one introduced themselves or wore name badges. Our receipt said \"Carlos\" but obviously our waitress was not Carlos because we had a girl. We were here on Friday 2/17/17 at about 6:30pm. A date to remember in history because it was the one and only time we visited this place."}
{"text":"Went to Wing Nuts for the first time today.  It's a bit hidden so we didn't notice it at first.  The wings were great crispy and the garlic sauce was really good.  There were 3 of us and we really liked the wings better than where we had been going.  It was a good experience we will defiantly go back."}
{"text":"I thought I would give this place a try for wings as I love them and I'm always looking for great places.  I have to say so far they have the best wings in town and they bake them instead of frying them. The taste is a big difference and is so much better than frying them.  This is my new place to get my wing fix!"}
{"text":"Their boneless wings are actually baked chicken instead of that nugget paste that's heavily breaded from other places, their wide range of sauces satisfied both me (spicey stuff) and my gf (sweet stuff). The happy hour prices are great. I got three domestic beers, loaded nachos and 18 wings for 25 bucks."}
{"text":"This place is a little hidden spot in the Northwest part of Vegas. At first we were unsure what to expect but after the first time we were hooked. All their food is baked and not missing any flavor at all.  Sunday $4 happy hour bloody Mary's are the best!"}
{"text":"I have been driving by the sign, finally stopped in to take-out dinner for the family. We got the Wing Nutz sampler platter, 6 traditional wings, 6 boneless, 4 hog wings, and a double order of buffalo chips. I also ordered 8 additional boneless wings to allow me to get some spicy. All of the wings are baked, they have a great variety of sauces as well. What else is cool is you can mix n match the sauces.

The staff was friendly, patient, and very knowledgeable. The family really enjoyed the wings and the hog wings. Really good flavor and great food. I just found our new go-to-place for wings."}
{"text":"Great little place has a sport bar feel quite comfortable. Stopped in an had original wings my wife had a chicken wrap and they were excellent fresh tasty we had there spicy buffalo chips with ranch . Service was excellent  highly recommend this place for a quick bite. Also easy on the wallet."}
{"text":"My family came here after we recently moved to the neighborhood. When we were walking up, we were a little weary of bringing our 2 year old along because from the signs in front we thought it might be too much of a bar. It had that appearance, but we went on a Sunday late afternoon, so it was pretty empty. 

The good:
Service was quick 
Food was good
Huge flat screen TVs 

The not so good:
Buffalo chips (sort of fries, sort of not) were all burnt.
Menu choices were pretty lackluster
No condiments on the table- no salt, pepper, ketchup, nothing. 
Wings didn't appear to be tossed in the dressing, so the dressing was just poured over the top of them.

The buffalo chicken wrap that I got was really good, but the side of chips were burnt, so I'd probably go here again but get a different side next time. My husband was not impressed with his boneless wings and his chips initially had no seasoning on them at all, so since there was nothing on the table to put on them, he had to wait for them to come back to us, take it to the back, and bring it back to the table. He was not a fan. 

All in all - good, not great."}
{"text":"I used to love this place when they first open been there a few times and the food was pretty Good when eating inside. DO NOT CARRY OUT I SPOKE WITH THE MANAGER Jackie I believe I could be wrong in the name but I explained how our food order was not correct on the last time I ordered they keep forgetting to put extra sauce and the potato chips in when we ordered them that's the second time she assured me it would be ing last order she even told my husband she checked herself well she didn't carefully check. My husband loves there Jamaican Jerk I love there southern honey BBQ sauce but I'm not going back plus the chicken had no seasoning and they gave me all flat pieces. Kevin  one of the workers said oh you have to ask for drumlets I said when that start... Bottom line it's too many mistakes and they were getting my money. Moving on I'm not the one that will try to hurt a business just want to give my opinion. You choose of you would like to go I'm not"}
{"text":"My type of place. The location is easily accessible to the 215,  lots of parking. When you go in, so many screens to watch whatever your sport heart desires.  The atmosphere was very clean and inviting. They have so many local activities coming up for March ( teams against humanity) caught my attention. The menu was very fun. So was the drink menu. During the week they offer many specials plus happy hour."}
{"text":"I love this place for the sole fact that they do their boneless wings with grilled chicken.  I just ordered UberEats from there and we ordered 2 snack size wings and some buffalo chips.  On the app it gives you the option to pick multiple flavors for the snack size.  Where if you're at the restaurant it's just 1 sauce. They still fulfilled both flavors so that was awesome!  I never received the buffalo chips so that was a bummer considering I had paid for them and I really wanted to try their spicy ranch.  Hopefully my next experience with that restaurant is better /:"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here on a Monday evening, wanting to try something new. It took about 45 minutes for us to just get out food... 

Everything is baked, which if fine, but they don't seem to really advertise that. I got the chicken sandwich and a mix of spicy/regular chips (which are the consistency of fries). My husband got boneless wings. When we got our food, my chips/fries were barely warm, if not cold. The chicken was just run-of-the-mill small chicken strips. Their sauces were good but not great. 

Their staff was friendly but not attentive to the table. We only got offered refills for our drinks when we were served our food...

The atmosphere was really nice and the restaurant was very clean."}
{"text":"My fiance and I have been wanting to try a different wing place besides the other franchised spots in town. When we walked in, we were greeted by several servers and immediately could pick our own table. Our server was great and very knowledgeable of the menu. Through observation a couple of the other servers seemed a little unorganized since its so brand new. I'm sure that will improve through time. But on a good note, we had no idea the food was all baked, not fried, so that was a nice surprise for us. I ordered 8 wings in traditional and chipotle BBQ sauce. My fiance ordered 12 bone-in wings in Carolina mustard and southern hotties, with the purgatory add-on (which adds quite a bit of spice if that's your style).  I accidentally ordered boneless wings (I typically prefer bone-in) so I was disappointed at first, but it was actually really delicious and juicy! Wings all come with a dipping sauce of choice and veggies. We definitely plan on coming back and trying other flavors, and I plan on ordering correctly the next time around!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit here. We were greeted quickly and our order taken fast. But 20 minutes later we didn't have food. The wings aren't fried they're baked, maybe that explains the wait? At nearly 30 minutes we received our food. We tried the southern hottie sauce, jalapeño honey and the Carolina mustard. I had the 'Oink & Cluck' and my husband got 8 regular wings and buffalo chips. We both enjoyed our meal and we will def return. 

The sauces will be a matter of preference. I LOVED the Carolina mustard. While my husband agreed it was good he said he couldn't eat a whole lot of it because it's so mustardy... Also, the 'hog wings' are an amazing idea. I would come back just for them!!! 

Customer service was decent, food was good but the wait was too long. But for good wings it was worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I like the fact that everything is baked. Not a fan of greasy wings. Wings were outstanding. Great beer selection. Wait staff was on top of it. Great place to go have wings, drink beer and watch a ball game. Very laid back atmosphere."}
{"text":"I know it's a wing place and veering from the specialty is always risky. Well it's Vegas so I went for the burger anyway. Glorified hockey puck marketed as a burger. Terrible!!! After eating there I heard from a local little bird that they had a huge bug problem and nearly failed the January health inspection. Needless to say I won't be back."}
{"text":"I was greeted as soon as I walked in. Definitely a cool place to come and hang out with some friends. The beers were great. I had a few of the IPAs and I wasn't disappointed. The wings and potato chips were also good. I had never tried baked wings but I actually became a fan after this. If you are looking for a chill place to grab a beer or some wings I definitely recommend this spot. Service was also good. :)."}
{"text":"House beer is awesome. Devastator for Guinness lovers, over the moon for the wheat drinkers. But the best is the hog wings! Absolutely phenomenal! #wingnutznation"}
{"text":"So this review is updated due to the excellent service I received from Kevin and Chris during Saturday nights cards against humanity event . I didn't realize that years ago I had actually been here and went to give my review and read my old one . Glad to see the service tonight was much improved and I look forward to coming back more often to eat and enjoy their events .

They have a variety of food options but also have days with karaoke or trivia plus they also have the cards against humanity .

We mostly drank but Kevin made sure we sampled the chips and salsa and man oh man was it delicious ...

For north side of town for a nice chill vibe to enjoy sports , booze and food I think if you've got either of the guys listed helping you ya will be a happy camper ."}
{"text":"Disappointing Dinner with the family! Expected this place to be good, but was far from it! To start off they weren't even busy to begin with & the service was horrible! We waited about 30 minutes for our food. The food was cold & had no flavor what so ever. We ordered the nachos which were disgusting & cost $9.99 they were so soggy & barely any toppings put on. We also ordered the tenders which were so disappointing! We will never go back to this place. I recommend just going to a Wing Stop or Buffalo Wild Wings!"}
{"text":"I ordered 100 wings for superbowl and when we got them home they weren't flavored.  The skimpy sauce cups came on the side.   Why advertise flavored wings if the sauce comes on the side?  I was hoping this would be a great place because it's so close to our home but it was a terrible disappointment!"}
{"text":"Awesome wings and great service. I was a little skeptical about the \"baked\"  wings but they are pretty dang tasty. They have a bit of a smokey flavor. Their craft beers are decent. The typical ipa, porter, double bock, here, etc. But they're done well. My favorite is the white ipa. This place has certainly earned my patronage."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing grilled boneless wings! Their traditional buffalo sauce is amazing along with their spicy lemon. This is definitely one of my new favorite wing spots!"}
{"text":"The wings here are hands down the best in town. Everything is made fresh to order  . Try the hog wings if you get a chance they are tender and full of flavor . All the sauces we have tried have been very tasty . The happy hour has great prices on drinks and even when it's not happy hour the drink prices are reasonable.  The service was great. All friendly staff willing to help out.  Musical Bingo was a blast. They do it Friday night's from 8-10."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever had. We got our meal before the appetizer. Appetizer came with salsa and onions that had been scraped off because we asked for pico on the side and no onions and since they already made our order wrong and had to take it back once they took the short cut this time. Waitress took our dissatisfaction personally and was very rude, I even thanked her and got no response. Both employees lied about who the manager on duty was, there wasn't one. We weren't charged for our appetizer and when we asked for the manager to complain about how we were being treated he was so unprofessional that I instantly knew he wasn't management. I asked for corporate's number and he refused to give it, said we could have our food for free and thought that would make me happy. I have free food at home with great service. I came to enjoy the experience. I recorded the whole interaction if the actual manager would like to see the staff you have running your establishment while your away."}
{"text":"Love this place! Friendly staff, fun music bingo nights. Just a great time and great food every time we stop in."}
{"text":"The wings were really good, though I got \"mild\" and my mouth was on fire. But the texture and flavor was fantastic. The buffalo chips (fries) were alright, little soggy but the ranch was good so it was fine. 

I took away 2 stars for a couple reasons, first it took forever. We waited for about an hour after we ordered. They also brought our side order of the fries well before the wings, I was happy because I was hungry but I would have liked warm fries with my food. They brought us the fries and then came back 15 minutes later and asked how it was going.. uh still waiting for wings ?. 


We will probably give them another try, but if the service is the same, not worth our time.

Editing to add, I just saw posted pictures of the \"buffalo chips\" ours must have been seriously underdone. They were completely white heh."}
{"text":"Friendly atmosphere, food is delicious. Their chicken wings are amazing. You should try the nachos with chicken. Love the fact that food is baked and not fried. I enjoyed the apricot beer a lot. Best chicken wings best experience. Highly recommend it for chicken wings lovers."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I'm a vegetarian reviewing a wings restaurant, so you might want to keep that in mind. My wing eating husband wanted to give this place 4 stars, but I told him he can write his own review. 

We came in on a Tuesday night because we were in the mood for something new. WingNutz just opened and is \"Hot & New\". Why not?

SUPREME QUESADILLAS ($6.99): Not impressed. Lacking a sufficient amount of cheese and does not come with sour cream. Huh? A side of sour cream costs $1. The quesadillas, weirdly enough, also came with pico de gallo INSIDE. I'm not used to that. 2/5

BUFFALO CHIPS ($2.99): I got mine spicy. These were just okay. Wish they were warmer. 3/5

8 WINGS ($8.99): Husband got 4 bone-in with Chili Garlic sauce and 4 boneless wings with Raspberry Chipotle. The boneless with the raspberry sauce were the favored wings. 4/5

VIBE: The restaurant was pretty crowded for a Tuesday night. I liked the openness of the place and the fact that they had outdoor dining seating. Music was perfect for that type of establishment, which was a mix of Top 40, Alternative, and EDM. Lots of large TV screens, making for an awesome game viewing hangout. 4/5

SERVICE: Average 3/5 

Worth a return visit?
Yes, but I'll get the nachos next time. WingNutz isn't a replacement to BWW's (which has better vegetarian options), but a welcome addition.

{"text":"The food is awesome. Best wings in town. It would be my go to place but the service is TERRIBLE. Keep that in mind when you go. You might be the only table in the restaurant but the service will still be awful. Love the place but they might need to hire new servers."}
{"text":"Another disappointing cheat meal. We went here around 12:30pm and it wasn't busy. There's country music playing in the background. Big screen TV's on sports channels.

The service was poor. Our food came out about 20 minutes - really? For chicken wings, carrots and celery???

We tried the mango, garlic chili and chipotle lime wings. We also got half regular chips and half buffalo chips. Nothing was spectacular. We saw the 4-star review and there was nothing 4-star about the food/service/ambiance. There was too much sauce so the chicken wings were soggy. The sauces the wings were drenched with were sweet. I asked somebody else to finish my food for me...that's a first!"}
{"text":"The wings had no flavor tried the bbq honey and jerk wings! Took them back! Price 14.99!"}
{"text":"Having the option of non-breaded, baked instead of fried chicken wings is refreshing. Food is tasty, service is friendly and a few good brews. Relaxing atmosphere with the ability to dine outside or play a game with friends like bean toss makes for a fun time."}
{"text":"Hubby and I come here later in the night whenever family is in town. Love the lighting and the patio seating ambiance. I also love that it is quiet. Something I cherish when raising an 8, 6, 2, and 6month old BOYS. Enough about those gremlins, let's talk about the chicken...

They really aren't all that bad. Each time we have gone our chicken has come out super fresh. The flavor options are great as well. I mean, you're getting chicken wings that aren't deep fried. They bake them. So if you're a little on the healthy but not so healthy conscience side...you've found your place.

The only turn off I have (hence the 3 stars) is please explain whhhyyyyyyyy is the service frickin slow? The food coming out...not so great. But because husband and I have come here for quick late night dates...it didn't bother us. I used to think it was because we come later in the night as the reason for the delay, but we have come during the day with the whole fam and a few others...same thing. It has gotten to the point where you look to check other folks' face to discover they're all thinking the same thing you are, \"where the hell is our food at\". The waitresses we have had when we have arrived earlier in the day sucked at simply touching base about our order. Almost like they are avoiding you because they already know your stomach is probably growling. Also, our buffalo chips have been brought to us more on the burnt tasting side. 

However, it is a place worth the shot especially if you're in the vicinity and are in the mood for chicken. But, be prepared to wait. It has been about 7 months since we have last gone...maybe times have changed?

Definitely kid and stroller friendly."}
{"text":"the food is ok but dsilike the gas taste on the food. Also says they are open til midnight which is not true"}
{"text":"Service: 5; Had 3 separate individuals warmly greet us and let us know to sit where ever. Was promptly asked about drinks and then checked on by another waiter to ensure we had been taken care of. Wasn't over burdened by being waited on too much (i.e. you know when they visit and you literally have a wing sticking outta your mouth...), and wasn't forgotten about either (empty glass for the entire meal :/). Service was perfect.

Food: 5; Hands down the best wings I've had in Vegas. My new favorite is the Parmesan Curry (Purgatory-level). I also had the traditional (hot) and those were your standard traditional flavored wings. The fact you can select from a large host of flavors and then adjust the heat to what you can handle was nice. We sat outdoors and enjoyed the environment and all. There were one or two gnats but that's to be expected...outdoors...

Cleanliness: 4; The restaurant was clean, the bathroom could've used a little attention but I have a feeling the kids who visited it 100 times were at fault. Tables were cleaned quickly and patrons serviced as fast as we were. 

This place has earned my continued patronage; it being close to home, friendly staff, and absolutely delicious has made it the new family favorite. I'm looking forward to enjoying the list of flavors available...oh and according to some of the other reviews their beer is pretty good. No disagreements there. I came for the wings however, and did not leave disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is terrible! We came on a Friday night, we sat down and waited 10 mins before someone came. The servers were rude, our Wings didn't come til 45 mins later. This place is poorly managed. I'll never come back."}
{"text":"This would be a good place if you are really craving wings but watching your girlish figure. Ate here tonight for dinner. Service was fast and friendly. Had boneless wings, which is really just boneless, skinless, baked chicken. Their ranch dressing is great. $3 bloody mary's on Sundays! Not bad.  I'd probably come back."}
{"text":"I'd give this place 0 star if I could. I would not recommend this place to anyone at all. We went here and it was not even busy, it's gonna take more than 30 minutes for somebody to take your order. And I said that because we've waited over 30 minutes before we finally stood up and left because nobody was taking our order. No I'm not exaggerating because if you look at the other reviews, we're not the first who have walked out of this place. Do yourself a favor, and go somewhere else. Be warned!"}
{"text":"Service: 3 stars - I was greeted by a cold personality, and for such a new business and chain to Las Vegas you would think they would be a good ambassador to the brand.

Food: 4 stars - We choose take out, ordered 12 wings traditional, 10 pork shanks, chips & Salsa, and Spicy chips. All the food was great, everything was individually packaged and labeled nicely. For Takeout they didn't not provide utensils, or napkins so that was a let down.

Cleanliness & Atmosphere: 2 stars - The place had large TV's throughout, and had me questioning whether they wanted to be a sports bar that had wings or a good restaurant. The place was well taken care of and looked brand new. My only other concern was the owners:managers had Yorkishire Terriers at the bar laying down, with their paperworks and computers splayed about... this can't be sanitary. Not to mention they didn't wash their hands one time while helping package or prepare food while going back and forth to their office duties."}
{"text":"I grew up in upstate NY, so I have had my share of wings. First of all, the wings are grilled. For me, this place produces better wings than most outlets that fry their wings. Initially when the place opened, it was hit or miss. That does happen with new businesses. I go about once every two weeks, and I must say that the place has really hit it's stride. They have music bingo on selected nights, which really adds to the atmosphere, and it's kid friendly. I highly recommend this place if you like your wings."}
{"text":"The food here is all fresh and delicious. Baked wings are a nice change from fried. Service was awesome, very attentive & actually felt the interest vs. just a passing \"are you good?\". Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"The last time I ate here I was really impressed by the customer service & the food was really good. I recently called in to place an order for pick up (we wanted the 20 piece wings as listed on their menu online) & the woman who answered the phone was very rude in advising me that the online menu hadn't been updated & that they only do 18 piece wings now. When I tried to respond she hung the phone up & unfortunately because of that I will not be going there again."}
