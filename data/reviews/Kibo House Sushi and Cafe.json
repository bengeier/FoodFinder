{"text":"This review is based on a take out order.   Place has a very clean and fresh atmosphere with the exposed brick and intimate seating along the exposed wall.  Upon entering you are greeted with a \"refreshment\" table with water with fresh lemon slices.  Service was prompt and polite. I ordered the opening special of spicy salmon and tuna rolls.   Very nicely packaged. They even have a little dish for your soy sauce!   Very nice flavours and just spicy enough. Everything tasted very fresh. Only reason they lose one star is because the rolls were not very \"tight\" and a bit falling \"apart-y\".  Other than that I would definitely recommend this place. Will come back and try more stuff for sure."}
{"text":"I took my family of 5 out on Mother's Day.  We thought we'd support a local new restaurant.  We'd walked by Kibo a number of times and decided to give it a try.  Keep in mind that the St. Clair strip is a competitive one.  With 3 minutes of Kibo we have Nama Sushi, Kome Sushi and MoOng.  This review is 99% reflective of the service.  The food was average dime-a-dozen sushi which is generally pretty good food (certainly good enough and at the right price point for my family).  We were sat at a table.  4 place mats/setting not 5 (we had to ask well after some food had been served).  No offer for drinks (they brought us some water.  When I ordered a beer for my wife and myself it came with warm glasses ('nuff said).  We ordered appetizers which came out late and one of which was totally forgotten about and served after the main courses.  Our server, whom I was told was the manager, disappeared after taking our order and I don't think anyone else picked up the table.  The rest of the order seemed like a surprise to the new server (who, to be fair, was doing his best to figure it out).  I told the manager about the problems because I thought the feedback would help them improve. Only an \"I'm sorry, we are new.\"  No offer for a free coffee or price concession.  I'm not looking for a free handout, just thought that it would be good business to offer something to get me to come back (the goal of any neighbourhood restaurant).  Net was that I blew $115 (I still tipped 15% because people need to make a living) on ok sushi that left me feeling like I didn't give my wife the Mother's day she deserved.  I won't be back.  Too many other options and only so much $ to spend on dinner for a family of 5."}
{"text":"Very funky interior decor. I always love exposed brick in caf√©s and restaurants. Service is very friendly and there is complimentary water with lemon for you upon arrival. They have a selection of prepared sandwiches and deserts. Conveniently located along st clair west outside streetcar stop it is definitely worth checking out!"}
