{"text":"Quick and convenient bite and a beer at the Lobby Bar in the Marriot Grand Chateau.  Small and simple menu, but a few good options. I went with the flat iron steak and the Total Domination IPA on tap.  Nice flavor on the steak!  And the service was great!"}
{"text":"This is a little known secret in Tempe at the hotel the phoenix Tempe Marriott at the buttes. Although it's \"big brother\" restaurant, top of the rock, gets all the glory, you can't overlook this fun little lobby bar with excellent kitchen items, fine cocktails, A lovely patio overlooking the cascading pools, and a great view of the city beyond.

If you're looking for something healthy and delicious, I recommend the tuna poke or the shrimp ceviche. They also have tune medallions over a bed of greens that is delicious. I can't believe the sea food choices are so good and taste so fresh given that the city is in a desert!

The lobby bar staff by friendly and efficient staff who will quickly serve you an excellent adult beverage while you peruse their menu. They're open a bit later than the other restaurant on site, and the light for music plays in the background while a couple of large flat screen televisions over the bar will broadcast your favorite sports or news channels, sans sound of course.

The lobby bar ranges from a quiet place to grab a delicious bite and a signature cocktail to a fun, raucous party when attendees to Christmas parties and other events at the hotel invade the open late love you bar for food and drink.

Both the beverages and food are very reasonably priced and of exceptionally high quality. Don't miss this hidden gem tucked away among the rugged buttes in Tempe."}
{"text":"We went to the lobby bar and the waiter was slow. The bartender had to come out from behind the bar to take orders. Unfortunately no one took our order so we ordered from the bar. After that Jesus showed up to take our order after 10 minutes. There are 7 tables and 4 sears at the bar. At a resort we should not have waited this long. The drinks were delicious so kudos to the bartender. Ok it gets worse the male waiter wouldn't help us (a couple) and the female would not help us BUT there were employees tables and tables with Single women and single men did not have to wait. We came here because my husband proposed to me here 5 years ago. Sadly we won't return"}
{"text":"Great libations and chill environment that gives a recharge to weary travelers! The Lobby bar is just that...in the lobby of the Marriott Grand Chateau. I ordered the $10.99 Caesar Salad and the $31.99 10 oz Ribeye with mash potatoes and vegetables. Ribeye is thinner than most ribeyes, but tasted great.  

The $13.99 Mango Mojito was excellent! Friendly staff. Food takes a little bit to arrive at the table, but not a big deal with great female company like I had! 

4+ stars as long as you don't care about the bill! Remember, it's Vegas! Gotta live a little!"}
{"text":"The Lobby Bar is located in the lobby of the Marriott Grand Chateau. In the dining room, they have comfy chairs with small round tables as well as a few flat screen tvs to watch news and football. 

Since the entrees weren't available until dinner time, we shared a Caesar Salad, BBQ Chicken Flatbread, And All Day Omelet. 

The Caesar Salad consisted of chopped romaine, parmesan, and croutons tossed in a creamy Caesar dressing. I liked how the romaine lettuce was fresh.

The BBQ Chicken Flatbread consisted diced chicken, mozzarella cheese, bell pepper, red onion, and cilantro drizzled with bbq sauce. I liked how the bbq sauce was tangy.

The All Day Omelet consisted of white eggs, spinach, bell peppers, mushrooms, and tomatoes. It was served with a green salad and fries. I liked how it was light in flavors."}
{"text":"One of the best Hotels Bars, I have ever experienced. Staff go over & beyond to make your stay wonderful. Marcos & Jesus went over and beyond. Will definitely be back to visit again next year. Thank you all."}
{"text":"The hymn of children - their laughter, high voices...and piercing screams can accompany your meal at the Lobby Bar. But we are in the vacation Marriott after all, and the great service and good bar food accompanied by a reasonable drink offering and prices suffice to assuage the nerves and blend in with the surroundings. It's the height of the tourist season so the lobby is filled with families variously clad in bathing suits or wrap arounds to black short dresses with all ages in between but overall the environment is good enough both for vacationers and those of us on business."}
{"text":"Good place to grab a bite after a long day and when you don't want to deal with humanity outside of your hotel. Comfortable and casual... The drink choices are endless and the staff pleasant. The chips are fresh and tasty!"}
{"text":"We came here the first night as we were tired from a four hour drive from Sedeona, Arizona & just wanted to lay low.  Our waiter, who's name I did not get, was very friendly & attentive with a wonderful sense of humor.  We ordered a few small plates; I ordered the buffelo shrimp flat bread with suculent shrimp, vegetables, & spicy buffelo sauce on thin slightly crispy flat bread.  I tried some of my mother's sweet potato putine with crispy sweet potatos, tender smoked postrami, cheese, & a rich gravy.  Round it off with A Cona Brewing Coconut Stout & you will not be disappointed.  For those of you wanting larger fare, they have hamburgers & sandwiches & other main items.  So, for wonderful food with friendly service in a casual upbeat atmosphere, Lobby Bar cannot be beat.  Keep up the good work guys."}
