{"text":"Placed sucked had shitty service to say the least and what do you know , no longer in business."}
{"text":"good atmosphere whether you like sports or family dining. the bar area is somewhat separated from the restaurant. the pizza is a good flavor with quality sauce and toppings, but the pizza is much smaller then it should be. ordered a large with toppings for $23. this was a smaller medium size at best. very thin crust.  chicken parm.  was very good. appetizers are fine. i compare them to applebees. happy hour is very good with cheap drink prices and reduced price appetizers. good place to catch a game. lots of big tvs."}
{"text":"Greetings fellow Yelpers. 
Have you ever craved really yummy food, but horrible service? Boston's just your place then! 
I took my friend Mo'nique there for a fun night out on the town, but it ended in disaster. Basically the waitress forgot about her ceaser salad and her root beer causing my friend to go into panic mode. 
Things got super intense then once the waitress also forgot MY root beer and then casually joked about it! Mo'nique wasn't digging her sense of humor. Long story short, Mo'nique never wants to come back to Arizona all because of Boston's!"}
{"text":"It's a respectable joint. It's big inside with plenty of flat screens to watch the game. Their burgers are pretty big with fresh ingredients although they only cook them medium well so if you like a little pink in your burger patty this isn't the place for you. The fries are cut fresh with a tasty seasoning. I'll be back to check out their happy hour, they advertise 3 dollar beers and 5 dollar appetizers. Overall it's a decent sports restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now, and I've had a pleasant experience each time. The staff, especially in the bar, is very attentive and kind. The food is pretty good, however, some of the items are a little bit pricy. I would definitely recommend going here to watch a sports game. It's not too loud to where it is tough to pay attention to the game, but it's not so quiet to where you feel uncomfortable to root for your team."}
{"text":"Ate here yesterday and did not have a good experience. It took quite a while for a server to greet us, but the nice hostess finally realized. Apparently our server knew she was giving us bad service the whole time and waited until the end of the meal to apologize for the \"bad service\" because she \"just got caught off guard.\" I'm not sure what she got caught off guard by, the table clearly in her section? I think it was just that she was talking to people at the table right next to us, which we could clearly see. She could've owned up to why she gave poor service, given that we could see exactly why. The food itself was just okay. The food is overpriced for the portion size. I got the sliders and one of them was a tiny piece of chicken and mostly bread, which is obviously saying a lot that it was small since sliders are already small. I won't come back."}
{"text":"Well hello Boston's, I'm very pleased to meet/discover you. I can tell this is going to be a fruitful relationship, filled with beautifully unhealthy (yet DELICIOUS) food, and gallons of beer. 

My first experience a couple days ago was genuinely a solid one. Kindly greeted, immediately served by a bartender as we awaited the server to come over. The server was a beautiful, shorter brunette (name started with a T...I think) who told me with a smile that it was Happy Hour. At 4 o'clock? Was this heaven? YES!

I got some delicious nachos off of the \"happy hour menu\" to start, followed by a great choice of a pepperoni \"Indy\" pizza....also 5 dollhairs. The desert menu looked as yummy as my main course was, but I was way too full to devour any of the mouth watering options.

Damn. My bill was double-take worthy. Boston's, Boston's, Boston's....I will certainly be back! Thanks for a great atmosphere with a solid staff all around. This might even be my new place to watch the Bears. 

Great option in Tempe for any crowd."}
{"text":"Boston's used to be our choice when the budget allowed for a special pizza. By special, I mean a pizza which costs twice as much as it should (delivered) but taste ten times better.

Tonight, Boston's surprised me. They delivered something worse than Pizza Hut or Domino's could ever produce, and the manager actually said, \"I don't know what to tell you\" when I told him how awful this was.

God help me, I will never waste my money at this place, again."}
{"text":"I gave this place a second chance still bad service the Chicken calzone was dry didnt taste right. It took forever just get attention one of the waitress to refill my drink."}
{"text":"I tried Boston's for takeout using a Groupon Now deal for a small group of friends. As such, I didn't get to experience the restaurant and service past the front counter however the atmosphere from what I saw had a nice, clean, classy sports bar feel albeit a bit commercial and unoriginal. Seemed like it could be an enjoyable place to have some dinner and watch a game.

Onto my food experience. I tried their classic pepperoni pizza and their southwest deep fried ravioli appetizer. Overall, I was very underwhelmed. The pizza has a uniform thick crust that is a bit dense and crispy but still bready inside. The sauce was a bit sweet and had a fairly pasty texture... pretty nondescript. Finally, it was topped with a fairly standard amount of a mozzarella fontina blend that didn't seem of particularly high quality as well as a disappointingly mild pepperoni. I guiltily admit I enjoyed the southwest ravioli. I say guiltily because it was one of those premade chain items filled with a processed cheese goo that could very well have been stolen from Taco Bell that you wonder why you like so much as you eat it.

All in all, even at the price paid after using the Groupon discount I would rarely find myself choosing Boston's again even over the big chain pizzas. At full price I consider it to be grossly overpriced. My only area of recommendation was that the service at the counter was nice and it seemed like it could be a nice place for dinner with friends while watching a game."}
{"text":"Not sure where to start, terrible on every level. Service was sloooooooow!! Ordered a specific drink, & we were told they were out of the vodka needed to make it. Ordered another drink & out of that too....really. Finally came around to take our order, and while we were waiting for our food the manager came around telling us that they were out of the lasagna we ordered. He blamed it on his supplier. We get our food & it's terrible!! We asked to be compensated for our bad experience & the manager hid in the back. He finally sent the waitress out to offer us 5.00 of our bill of over 150.00!!! Topping it all off I got food poisoning!! Such a disappointment this USED to be a great place."}
{"text":"I completely admit up front that I've had terrible experiences here, however they rarely occur and the waiters that cause those terrible situations don't stick around often. I am a frequent customer and show up at least once a week. The staff does recognize me and the person I dine with- (unless it's lunch time staff, who doesn't know us at all.) They know our drinks, and know us well enough to ask us about an appetizer, entrée, and desert with enough space to finish each course properly before bringing out the next one. 

The menu was recently re-done, causing much disappointment, however, there are more options now and organized perfectly. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Went there before an ASU game as two couples.  The server was pretty nice but very unprepared and kept forgetting things.  At one point, we made a bet that one girl would never get the lime in her beer that she ordered right when we sat down.  The bet against the lime won.

The manager did agree with us and worked to remedy the situation, but it took sooo long to get all of our food and drinks and half of it was messed up.  In no rush to return."}
{"text":"We arrived to watch a UFC fight with our friends and wanted to be seated next to them.  They wouldn't let us sit in the booth directly behind them because they said they squeeze people in because of the fight.  We had to spend $15 each in order to watch the fight from horrible tv's.  The area we were sitting in never ended up getting full at all and they let someone else sit in the booth while we sat at a table directly under the air vent that was freezing.  Our food was only okay. My husband ordered a calzone and they were surprised when we asked for a side of marinara and i ordered a shrimp pasta with broccoli which was really salty.  I wouldn't go there to watch a fight if you want to be seated my friends.  Our waitress did an okay job but the rest was just very disorganized."}
{"text":"Ratty, torn-up rolling office chairs with a print that died a violent death somewhere around 1991 are not exactly what I think of when I hear \"gourmet pizza,\" but we were quite hungry, so I didn't even consider walking out.
Not much vegetarian on the menu, though it'd be easy enough to come up with a pizza that didn't involve meat if you were so inclined. I went for the pasta and salad lunch special. My \"whole wheat\" penne looked like ordinary pasta to me, but the spicy diablo sauce covered up the mushiness and freezer burn OK. Breadstick had icky dehydrated garlic and a definite old taste to it, but the texture was nicely fluffy.

The iceberg-dominated salad was 100% unremarkable, though I have to wonder whether it would have been better if I got the actual raspberry vinaigrette dressing I'd requested instead of a bland, sugary \"balsamic\" vinaigrette. 

He chowed down on his tuna melt and fresh-from-the-freezer fries, and I have to say the sandwich looked like the best thing we were served, but I'm pretty sure his devouring it was based on the fact that it was 1 p.m. and he hadn't had breakfast.

Service: Bleh. Our waitress got the job done, but she wanted to be there as much as I did. Atmosphere: lots of TVs to distract you from the nasty chairs. Everything was old and worn out except said TVs."}
{"text":"Ate here yesterday for lunch and despite all the bad reviews of this place I went anyways and my experience was actually pretty good. I ordered the Chicken Pesto Flatbread Pizza, it was large enough for two but I was able to eat half there and the other half in my car back to work (Yup it was that dang good!) The crust was flavorful and crunchy, toppings were generous and worked harmoniously together. The server did take forever to give me napkins but I'll let her slide because when she brought the bill she did give me another drink in a to-go cup without being asked to do so (score in my book)."}
{"text":"Yes this place has great food. The ambiance is a bit like hanging out in grandmas kitchen with a bunch of tvs surrounding you and a bar with yummy drinks. I have no idea why this place is called bostons other than the fact the server understood my boston sarcasm. It's in a sketchy location, but not far from downtown Tempe"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and will probably not go back. The first time I just sat at the bar and had a couple beers and some nachos. The nachos were average. The bar tender was super friendly and the service was pretty good.

The second time the waitress was a total space cadet. We got there and she brought some water over after about 15 minutes and then came and checked on us once every half hour after that. We were there a good 30 minutes before they put on the game we had requested. When we ordered our beer, she had no idea what we were talking about. The food we got was cold by the time it got to us. Even if it was hot, it still would have been sub-par.

The same \"regulars\" were in there both times I've been there. They're a little bit loud and both times were visibly inebriated.

There are enough other bars in the area. I would avoid this one."}
{"text":"I've been to this place many times and I've never had any issues with anything. The staff has always been very courteous and I think one time we were able to bring a coupon and enjoyed a 40 dollar meal for about 15 dollars. The staff graciously accepted the coupon and we tipped well.

The food quality is the only question. They have an odd take on food quality. They have a huge kitchen but their take on something like a breadstick may be way overcooked and oversalted. Something as simple as pasta may be waaay too cheesy. Something like pizza you can't mess up, so yeah, they do it well.

But what they do well is so expensive. Well, everything is expensive considering the quality. They have hours that let you order apps on the cheap. Then it's worth it. Plenty of TVs in the \"bar area\" that is decidedly separate from the dining area. It's a huge difference in atmosphere and a major plus of this place.

This is a great place for medium to large group outings. They deal with college students all the time so they are hardened vets at dealing with weirdos. The outside seating is wonderful during the summer."}
{"text":"I met a fellow Yelper here to watch the World Series and it was definitely a good place to catch a game.  I was kinda thrown by the name- Boston's Gourmet Pizza, being as pizza in Boston is pretty awful and definitely not gourmet but its really just your standard bar/American chain fare.  They have a great happy hour- $3 well drinks, $4 beers, $5 apps.  I ordered chicken fingers since they were billed as being \"lightly breaded\"...but there was seriously a 2 inch thick casing of fried breading around the chicken.  I just wasn't expecting that.   I found it odd that they didn't have ketchup on the tables and didn't offer it as a dipping sauce. 

Here is a small rant- Why don't they like ketchup in Arizona?  Most places you have to ask and then they give you Hunt's. For real?  Everyone knows that Heinz is far superior.  And what is with the fascination with Ranch?  

Anyways, back to the review. The atmosphere was very relaxed and it was fun to watch ASU fraternity pledges come in and sit at the bar ordering cokes.  (I always thought you couldn't wear pledge pins in a bar area?) As time went on it seemed that more and more ASU freshman were making their way in....just as I was making my exit.  

Oh, and the baseball bats as door handles are pretty cool."}
{"text":"Literally one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had.

Came on a Sunday night at around 8:30 PM with my girlfriend. We were the only two patron's in the dining room. Our server, awkward from the beginning, seated us in two office chairs across from one another. After bringing our drinks and menus to us in a relatively quick fashion, what happened next would begin the worst 25 minute dining experience of my life.

The waitress came back about 5 minutes later to take our orders, only to inform me that what I wanted was not on the menu. Great. She left for another five to ten minutes or so to help, well, nobody else since the restaurant was empty.

When she came back and took our order, I got the Chicken & Broccoli and my girlfriend got the Spicy Alfredo Chicken or whatever it was. The food came rather quickly, to my surprise. However, I was immediately disappointed. 

After opting for a bite of my girlfriend's dish, it's similarity to that of a Lean Cuisine was overwhelming. 

As far as my meal went, the broccoli was crunchy and dry, tasting literally like it was freezerburned and then microwaved. The chicken was virtually flavorless and disgusting. 

Our waitress never came and asked how our meal was and when she saw both plate's near full, didn't ask what was wrong and simply took them away.

Complete waste of $28 and I hope the waitress understands why her tip was $0."}
{"text":"Went here the other day for a quick lunch with my coworker....or so I thought!  We went at noon, which I know is a busy time, but it didn't look insanely busy to me.  I would think any restaurant should be prepared for a busy noon hour.  My friend and I both ordered salads and it literally took an hour to get our meals.  The girl seating people was very nice and apologetic, but even our waitress was unresponsive.  We also both ordered our salads with the dressing on the side and after an hour they couldn't even get that right.  My friend went ahead and ate hers as is, but I sent mine back.  The second salad came out very quickly which I was grateful for.  Since we were in a hurry at this point we asked for our checks immediately.  We had asked for separate checks, but when we got the check it was together.  The waitress took it back and separated them for us.  We both put our credit cards down immediately, but were almost done with our meals when I finally waved the checks at the waitress to pick up. The food wasn't bad, but I will never go back for such poor service!"}
{"text":"New owners have turned this bar into a gulp...Minnesota Twins bar. I'm sure they will draw large crowds for Twins games. Very selfish of the owners. Nobody cares about the Twins and even when tourists come in winter, they aren't playing. The pizza I had on my free pizza deal (text club) was horrible despite nice bald manager saying everything was prepared fresh. Well, it didn't taste fresh - it tasted like Totino's frozen pizza. They are charging almost 9 bucks for that also - luckily it was free. If you order that, you will feel like you got robbed. The entire right side of the bar is also a hangout for some of the biggest older drunks in Tempe. It is like that area is their territory. Get rid of the riff raff new owners!"}
{"text":"New Owners. Less happy hour deals in food.  So I tried fried pickle slices  fried banana pepprs for my 1st time.  They are served lightly  breaded with a Ranch Dip.  
Draft  pint glasses aren't chilled and the draft isn't very cold. I slipped a large chunk of ice in each pint I had."}
{"text":"How to ruin a perfectly fine spaghetti & meatballs platter:  cover it with cheddar cheese.  That's right, they made food WORSE by adding cheese!  That is no small accomplishment.

Pasta: fine.
Meatballs: fine.
Tomato sauce with beef: fine.
Parsley and whatever other garnishes were on there: fine.
Cheddar: what the hell are you thinking?????

Use mozzarella if you need to cover it with cheese.  You know, the one that actually goes well with tomato sauce.  I have no problem with creativity or with changing traditional recipes when it actually improves the quality of the dish.  Pasta with tomato sauce and cheddar is a culinary fail.

They still get three stars, because everything else about the food was all right, and the people were friendly."}
{"text":"Chris R and I were two diehard football fans traversing the bowels of sports bars in the Phoenix area.  Made soft by previous seasons of DirecTV with limitless 30 packs of Coors Light, cheap homemade food, and plenty of room to stretch out in front of multiple big screen TV's, we had it made.  

Bam! Flash forward to two leases in five months, a lack of big dolla finances, and we find ourselves out on the DirecTV sports-packageless streets. Enter Boston's:

$4 32 oz beers, $5 filling appetizers, an open neighborhood bar atmosphere, and hyper friendly servers. The chairs, while they do seem like they were purchased at a garage sale, are incredibly comfortable and lean back for easy viewing of the 'wall of sports tvs.' 

I've never been here without a sporting event on, but there are no sports bars as comfortable in the Tempe area. Thank you for saving us Boston's!!"}
{"text":"I met my 3 new bosses here for lunch today.  Two of us ordered the French Dip.  We chose this place because it is usually quiet and a good place to carry on a lunch conversation (they told me) but it was my first time there.  

We asked for a quiet place to sit and the host noted that the music was quite loud and offered to turn it down without us asking.  

The service was very friendly and the food was good, however, I was more interested in the conversation than the restaurant or food so that means it did end up being a good place for our intent...obviously, since we were not distracted by noise or bad service or bad food.

I would return."}
{"text":"This has quickly become one of my favorite hang out spots in Tempe. My coworkers and I often go here after work to have a drink. The employees that work there are super friendly and so are the other regulars. They are never busy so the drinks never take too long and neither does the food. They are open until 2 a.m. every night so its a good place to go after our restaurant closes. I love the baseball bats on the bathroom doors and the overall vibe of this place. They have happy hour specials from 11-close that include $5 appetizers as well as drink specials. The pizza is pretty good as well. I now stop by here a few times a week and will continue to do so."}
{"text":"Sometimes you have to be careful with whom you eat lunch.  We were thinking about burgers, and I suggested the best burger joint I'm aware of in Phoenix, The Grind.  But nobody wanted to spend $15 on a burger.  The driver of the car made an executive decision to go to Boston's, but it was too late - the car was already moving!

So, we arrive at Boston's.  I've already had their pizza, and it was uninspiring.  After you've had pizza in New York and Chicago, and even local joints like Pizzeria Bianco, and you have places like Spinato's in your rotation, an uninspiring pizza is not really even worth eating for lunch.

I started with the Mountain Dew to drink.  It was awful.  Coworker across the table said the Arnold Palmer wasn't very good, either.  Bad drinks - strike one.

I went with the jalapeno and onion straws burger, cooked medium.  But wait, they cook everything medium-well, according to the server!

Out comes my burger and fries.  I discovered that our waitress wasn't being entirely truthful about the burger temperature; they don't cook burgers medium well, but hockey puck.  These burgers are what you get when you accidentally leave it on the grill for two hours too long.  I suspect the restaurant staff, before opening, completes such preparatory tasks as hooking up the hoses on the soda fountain, wiping down the tables, setting up the chairs, and putting the burgers on the grill.  I wasn't too worried about spilling my drink because I had a nice, absorbent meat patty to soak up the moisture.  I could go on and on about those burgers...

And you have to love freezer fries.  Tastes just like home, at least if you're a bachelor like myself, and cooking consists of pulling something out of the freezer and heating it up.

One of my coworkers smartly pointed out that it's nice not having to worry about getting your hands wet holding your burger.  I pointed out that it's kind of nice not having to worry about your taste buds getting too excited.  Another nice, positive spin I put on the meal was that it would make the boring drudgery of the work day seem that much more exciting by comparison.

And finally, I lobbed my most viciously backhanded compliment on the place - the pièce de résistance, if you will - by pointing out how nice it is that we saved a whole $3 by not going to The Grind.  

I will admit, it is nice to have dining experience like this every now and then.  It keeps things in perspective.  Because how else will you be able to truly appreciate a good, or even an average, meal?"}
{"text":"I love this place! Good food! Amazing deals and best of all, free parking!!!!!

They have 50 percent off industry night Sundays and an amazing happy hour 3-7 and 10- close! Plus they have a desperate dining lounge and sports bar so it's good for whatever mood you're in'"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here in September 2010. It was a Sunday and it wasn't busy. Our waiter \"BOSS\" was very friendly and had a few suggestions on what to order. Boss and my husband chatted about football and he kept our drinks full without having to ask. The pizza was awesome and I wish we had one here in town. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Only stopped here, because every where else was open for ages of 21yrs and older? Kinda surprised by that because not all students at ASU are over 21! Any who,
Family and I always looking for a new place to try, and we never heard of Boston's. So we  checked this place out. Wifey had their bacon cheeseburger w/fries. Burger was cooked medium well, very delicious! I actually loved their fries? Daughter had this plate called trio something??? It had the samples of meat lasagna, fettuccine Alfredo, and chicken Parmesan. She like the plate very much, I am not a lasagna person, I had better chicken Parmesan, I did how ever liked the fettuccine. I order a well done pepperoni pizza. I loved the pepperoni, pizza sauce, and cheese. I was not that impressed with their crust! Over all we had a good time, we have had better! But yes we would come back if we were in the area."}
{"text":"I wonder about restaurants named after cities. Is it considered a slight against the food in the transplant city? Is Boston's saying: \"People of Phoenix, your food is so non-descript that we're bringing in the menu based on a city whose Irish-American citizens are most famous for eating potatoes.\" Or does it really matter more which city it is? So if a restaurant opened up that called itself \"San Francisco's\", it might not be that much of a snub? As opposed to a place called Detroit's (\"Featuring cuisine inspired by the people of the Motor City\"), it would be a civic smack in the face?

An important question. But since I'm not a Phoenix native, I had no skin in this game and felt it was fair to visit Boston's to dine. It's billed as a pizza place, but really this has the feel of a sports bar. And not a bad one, I should add. There is a really wide area of large tables set out in front of the bar with a number of big screen TVs for your convenient viewing pleasure. I also liked that they had a number of high tables; there's far too many tiny seats these days that make you feel like you're low-rider dining.

The interior design is a bit generic: the comparisons to Applebee's or Chili's are fair. There is room for an upgrade here. Since this is more of a sports bar, some memorabilia could help; maybe Kurt Warner can donate a jersey. Or better yet, now that he's retired, perhaps they could employ Kurt Warner as a greeter.

The tabletops have a number of coasters with questions on them that range from \"Hottest Actress\" to \"Best City\". Apparently designed to provoke a generic discussion on an awkward date, I felt that the \"Best City\" coaster was a bit of a trick question: is the correct answer Boston or Phoenix? Or should I just say screw it and go with Seattle? (TAKE THAT PORTLAND! YOU'RE NOT EVEN ONE OF THE CHOICES!) Anyways, conversation starters if you're desperate.

And speaking of starters, I went with an appetizer: the Southwest Ravioli. It's a ravioli (no false advertising here) stuffed with cheese (Monterrey Jack and cheddar) with jalapeno peppers and ranch dipping sauce. It was greasy and decadent. I loved it and even considered ordering a second round.

Instead I went with a main course. Now I know that it's a pizza place, but I'd just finished a half marathon a few hours before and wasn't certain if my stomach was yet up to pizza. So I went with the.....Bacon Cheeseburger. This works well as a stand-alone menu item: it comes with cheddar and mozzarella (I love the cheese emphasis at this place, the owner must be a mouse), onions, lettuce and mayo. There may have been tomato also, but I think I disdainfully tossed these away. Regardless, this was a fine burger cooked just right.

Service here was also prompt and my pop refills were frequent and performed without me having to notify them. If I lived in the Phoenix area, I would consider this a nice place to catch a game."}
{"text":"this is conveniently located a few miles away from arizona state university... right off of mill and university if you're familiar with the area.

great drink specials!! a 32 oz domestic beer for $3!! you can't beat that :) the pizza here is pretty tasty, but i've had better elsewhere. this is just down the street from \"the boy's\" apartment, so we often head over there for drinks and don't have to worry about driving home in \"ticket-happy tempe\"!!

great surroundings with lots of memorabilia on the walls and baseball bats for bathroom door handles!! there are a few arcade games, a pool table (i think) and a nice big patio. a great place for happy hour get togethers... wish we had one a little closer to us here in seattle!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I wanted pizza last night and Oregano's had a crazy long line, so we ended up here at Boston's. Neither of us are hardcore UFC followers, so we weren't aware of the big fight night going on last night. We were asked if outside was okay and because the weather right now is too amazing to be indoors, I agreed to sit on the patio....until we got to our table, which was in the very furthest corner where a couple of guys were hovering, smoking freshly-lit cigars. I'm not a smoker, so it always irritates me that sitting outside is not an option, unless you enjoy inhaling second hand smoke. But what are you gonna do? It's not like they can smoke anywhere else, so I get it, just don't wanna be a part of it while eating.

So, the wait for a table inside began. We should've driven to Barro's or something but we were already there and figured, what the hell. The hostess, Alyssa, was super sweet and so genuinely apologetic for us having to wait. She found a table for us, sat us, cleaned the surface, took our drink order and even our food order. She was trying so hard to please every customer she encountered. However, one particular manager (his accent sounded Russian to us) was constantly in her face, critiquing everything she was doing. After our order was put in, he came to our table and explained that Boston's had spent $4800 to broadcast the fight and that we had to spend $15 minimum each. \"You understand,\" he says, with his sweaty palm on my back. Fuckin' gross! I told him that I did understand, but we were there to eat, there was no signage explaining this, nor were we told upfront....\"so it's not my problem.\"

Our waitress (pretty sure her name was Brittany) came over after and explained that she wasn't concerned about a minimum. She was very pleasant and attentive to every detail.

I'm giving this crappy place 2 stars because the service from the two lovely ladies who helped us actually made the experience worthwhile. The manager was a dick and the pepperoni pizza was definitely not gourmet. We had chicken nachos as an app, though and they were not bad at all.

So to sum up: nachos=good. The waitstaff was awesome. Pizza=very sucky. And during a UFC event, the noise level is deafening."}
{"text":"It's been over two years since my initial Boston's review, so I figured it was time for an update. Boston's has been our go-to place to watch Sunday football for the past three football seasons. We always sit at the bar and have gotten to know the bartenders and waitresses that work Sundays. We have also gotten to know the other Sunday regulars. I guess you could say Boston's is our Cheers. Everyone knows our name.

32 oz Bud Lights are now $3 and appetizers are still $5 all day on Sunday (this is also their HH special during the week). Starting this year, doors now open at 10 am on Sundays during the first part of the football season. Of the food I have tried, I recommend the mozzamia, potato skins, baked cheese fries (a new addition to the menu), and Boston's Chicken salad with fried chicken (you can either get grilled or fried chicken). 

Plenty of TVs dot the interior of the space so there is no excuse not to watch your game. In Tempe, I can't think of a better spot to watch sports."}
{"text":"The service is terrible. Or at least the server we had was terrible. We had a large group about 15 that came in about four waves. I ordered with the first group. An hour later, all four groups had gotten their food but me. And I ordered a salad. That the server had recommended. 

When I finally asked her to cancel it, she seemed surprised and asked \"You're not hungry anymore? A salad shouldn't take that long. I'm sure it's coming out.\" So I smiled and said \"I know salads don't take a long time, but it's been a hour and I ordered before all these other people.\" Nevertheless, it was another 15 more minutes before it showed up.

After one of my group (who ordered a recommended dessert from the same waitress and did not show up for thirty minutes) complained to a manager, we got the salad and dessert comped, but there were never any apologies from the waitress. 

The salad wasn't even very good. :( Sadness."}
{"text":"Mixed reviews- Yes the pizza is pretty good. But been there once and had the nacho's, cost me almost $20 bucks. And yes you guessed it, the plate of nacho's with 15 chips and each chip going around plate and each nacho had typical stuff a little beans sum cheese sum lettuce sour cream. But you know those nacho plates,you've seen it not a pile of chips just individual chip next to each other all the way around outside of plate. It was like $19 bucks and drank water. I was like come on I can go too fili b's and get with carne asada on my nacho's and big pile of em for $5 bucks. Food is good ie pizza, but expensive !!! For what you get....."}
{"text":"The food is not terrible, just your typical low-end chain restaurant.  I would categorize it somewhere between Baja Fresh and Applebees.  Our waitress was nice and attentive."}

{"text":"This place absolutely sucks. My party arrived at midnight last night and that's when our trouble began. Here's a condensed version of what happened:
- No server came to our table for 15 minutes after our arrival when I looked over the railing beside our booth and an employee responded \"Do you need something?\" I responded \"Can we get some service?\" 
- It took 20 minutes for a simple martini to arrive at our table that was ordered upon our arrival. Their excuse \"The printer at the bar broke\"
- When our food finally arrived, only half the order was there (a mushroom flatbread). That one item alone took an hour. A half hour later, my chicken sandwich finally arrived. Their excuses \"We had a cook walk out in the middle of service\" \"The manager had to be in the kitchen cooking\" 
- Excuse after excuse from two servers and a manager who are some of most incompetent idiots I have ever seen in a restaurant. Their solution; Lame apology after lame apology and comping our meal. They also gave us \"Boston's Bucks\" for our next visit. 

What qualifications do I have? First, I'm a REAL chef with an MBA, a BS in Hotel-Restaurant Management and an Associates in Culinary Arts. I have been in Food and Beverage for 20 years. I realize most people working here are working their way through college, but that is no excuse for this piss poor service. Would you like me to come
in as a consultant and show you how it's done Boston's?"}
{"text":"I have been here many times and have always had a good experience. My favorite item on the menu is the Chipotle Chicken and Bacon salad. When I introduced a friend to this salad she immediately told her husband who said, \"I've been getting it for years...it's the only thing I order anymore.\" I am not a big salad eater but I crave this salad and sometimes plan my work route so I can stop for lunch there."}
{"text":"Wow...$5 pizzas for happy hour??  And they were gooooood.  The cheese fries were good too.  I was pleasantly surprised by this place.  Very good for bar food!"}
{"text":"We stopped by for a quick bite.   It was too late for lunch and dinner was at a friend's house, so an appetizer for us.  We chose to eat in the bar so we could watch the end of the Suns game (they lost in double overtime).  Our nachos were good and more importantly not soggy.  The bonus was when we got the bill, we discovered that we had hit during happy hour and our nachos were discounted."}
{"text":"Wow so much has changed since the last time I have been here. The place has gone down hill and looks like it is still on that decent. The place used to be a live and hip place for the area and now its just seems to be getting ghetto.

The food is still great and hasn't changed so thank god for that one. What has changed is the service and staff. I'm not gonna judge people based on appearance but when it comes to the service industry appearance is everything. I did see people in uniform but just having a Bostons shirt on was it, some staff looked like they were wearing yoga pants and flip flops. Maybe they were off the clock and changed but still to see then in food service areas was kinda iffy for me. 

Our server was trying but not hard enough. I can understand if you are busy and that you might have been the only one working at the time but if you pass by the table 5 times and to say nothing is kinda rude when we have yet to order.

I say the food is great, hence the 3 stars, the staff and service need to go. Will I be back? Yes, but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"Like most places in the world people capitalize on greatness and this place used a great city to dupe me out of a good dinner. I have lived in Boston for 33 years and never had a pizza so poorly done. If you have ever had a NY style pizza this is not it. It is moor like a House of pizza style pizza for 26 bucks. Get tacos because this pizza is horrible I would say that Ellios is better. Sorry Bostons but try again go to Beacon hill and eat Upper Crust and then try again."}
{"text":"When it comes to pizza, I'm all about the sauce.  

Boston's has GREAT sauce.

The decor, it's kinda generic."}
{"text":"I loved this place when I lived in upstate New York, and would do a day in Toronto!  So you can imagine my level of excitement when I found out that we had two locations RIGHT HERE in the Valley!!!  Well  kinda.  I still like this location, and will most certainly make the trip to Tempe.  

The menu is a bit different from the Canadian version I adore, but nevertheless, the selection is solid and quality is high.  If an appetizer is what you want, look no further then the chips and quaso.  The pizza I am convinced you just simply can't go wrong with on any selection.  They also offer plenty of other items such a burgers, salads, pasta and more.

The only part that I found to be negative was the mighty slow service for a slow Saturday night.  The bar area was solid, but the dinning side was rather slow.  I feel as if one has three tables to tend to, that he or she should be of reasonable speed when it comes to taking orders and refilling drinks.

Overall though I am still real happy to have Boston Pizza in Metro Phoenix, and am looking forward o my next trip!"}
{"text":"Boston's is one of my favourite places.
The first time I ate here, I had their mozzamia/mozzarella sticks and a caesar salad. Their mozzamia is cooked in triangles and are well cooked to crispy and hot. They're served with marinara sauce, which I don't care for, but I have tried it and the flavours do seem to go together. Their marinara sauce seems a bit thin and sweet, yet is still complementary. Their caesar salad was above expectation, with a tangy sauce and crunchy croutons.
The second time I ordered from Boston's, a mate & I had a pineapple pizza delivered. It was a medium size pizza. Delivery was prompt. Their pizza was cooked well but not with that generic sort of melted cheese look and texture. The cheese was soft and subtle-flavoured, which meshed well with the pineapple. The pizza itself was not heavily seasoned, and in no way overpowering. The crust, however, had a want for herbs and spices of some kind, as it was quite bland, with a particularly average crispy bread flavour.
The last time I ate at Boston's, three friends and I together had an appetizer each and shared them. We of course had the mozzamia, but also tried their spinach artichoke dip, and their southwest ravioli. Each were very good. The ravioli may be a bit too spicy for anyone who keeps their heat levels gringo style. The mozzamia was loyal to previous experiences. Their spinach artichoke dip was creamy, with a lot of whole spinach and chunks of artichoke. The crostinis that came with the spinach artichoke dip were pretty tasty on their own- although much better with the dip, as expected- and the dip also worked well with the southwest ravioli and the mozzamia.
We also tried their brownie dessert, which is two brownies and two scoops of vanilla ice cream. The brownies are slightly closer to fudge than brownies in consistency due to their sheer warmth and freshness. It's a good staple dessert with nothing particularly unique about Boston's interpretation, except I do like that you get twice as much as most other places would give you. They also have dessert shooters, which are mini versions of their regular desserts in shot glasses, including this brownie one if you don't have two people to share with or can't eat two brownies/scoops on your own.

As far as the building and the atmosphere goes, it is your generic kitschy sports bar look. The outside of their front doors have baseball bats for handles. There are sports team flags (Boston/New England and Arizona teams) hanging from the ceiling. There are neon lights. There is a bar area. Anytime I go there, it isn't particularly busy, especially not inside. Usually there is a group or there are two groups sitting outside. They don't have an especially good selection of music- some kind of radio hits, or top 20 or something playing in the background- so if that particularly bothers you, just order out. It would be improved if the music was quieter, probably. They have a lot of windows, but I've never gone during the day, so I don't know if the sunlight makes things feel better or worse inside."}
{"text":"Great place for happy hour 5-7pm daily. Ordered a friggin huge man cup of beer (domestic - 32 ounces) for 4 bucks! All the appetizers were $5 bucks including the stuffed mushroom. The flavor on the mushroom which is a bit strong but presentation and flavor was awesome for 5 dolla meal. 4 stars for feelin buzzed and full under $10 bucks. Def. worth it."}
{"text":"Ive been here once and it was pretty decent.  It's a bar type place that happens to have pizza and other food.  With Oregano's across the street, Id have to choose them over this place for pizza.  The pizza here just didnt do it for me.

I did enjoy their green bean fries and wings.  Service was awesome.  We had a girl named Michelle who was amazing (5 stars).  It was right before the dinner crowd during the week, so the place was slow.  Cool vibe in here though."}
{"text":"For me it's all about the food. I've only been here once for lunch. I ate on the patio which was all right, but predictably noisy. The service was excellent; my pizza was not. 

I ordered a small Hawaiian style pizza. The dough was of the pan-fried variety, which gave it a great texture, but the dough was utterly flavorless. That might have been forgivable if the other things about the pizza were good, but they weren't. The pineapple was also nearly flavorless. The crust got soggy pretty quickly and I stopped eating when that happened.

Other pizza crusts might taste better, but this was my experience. I can't say I'm planing on returning. If I do go again I will not order the pizza, which is sad considering that the pizza is supposed to be the restaurant's specialty.

Edit 5/30/08:
I've been back two or three more times with my team at work, and it's been awful every time.  The non-pizza food is okay, but the service has been consistently under par and nothing I've had to eat there made me feel like coming back again.  Almost everything I've tried tasted like it was made from low-quality (read: cheap) ingredients.  I'm changing from 2 stars to 1."}
{"text":"Why all the hate on Boston's?  Granted I have only been here for lunch and never tried the pizza so this review may be a bit one sided... 

What do you expect from a low end chain restaurant? The service has always been great for lunch, our waitresses have always been quick and attentive and they seem to understand people are in a bit of a rush at lunch time. There are a ton of choices on the lunch menu, including both pizza and pasta specials of the day (and they are decently priced). The soups are good, as is the club.  This is another place where the food is not gourmet, but you get what you pay for... Decent."}
{"text":"Boston's is one of my favorite go-to restaurants in the Tempe area
I love their pizza and wings
but they also have really great drink specials
I have been to this Boston's at least 10 times and every time I get the same great service and the same great food
Tonight was my most recent visit and there was an ASU football game so it was busy
Also on Thursday's there is a Trivia game that goes on in part of the dining area
I was up for the challenge and it was my first time
The questions were all semi hard
I googled a couple
Shhh...
I had a ton of fun though, it was nice to just play a game with a group of people
The guessing part was the fun part of the game
One of the questions was:
Who was the accomplice of the Oklahoma bombings?
Who knows that? Haha I sure didn't
I put UNABOMBER
totally wrong

Anywho, my point here is Boston's is a great place to go to eat, drink a beer, or watch a game...

But if you are in no hurry and like to play TRIVIA
Go on a Tuesday or Thursday night around 630pm

Fun, fun, fun

PS- I only got 2 questions right out of like 10 haha"}
{"text":"I have visited Boston's twice, and both times I've been disappointed.

The wait staff is ok but not particularly attentive. They seemed to want to refill my water ten times while I'm waiting for my food, but they are nowhere to be found when I'm missing a fork.

The food is not great. The salmon on the salmon caesar was overcooked and dry, and there was far too much dressing on the salad itself. The pizza is nothing to get excited about; you can get a better pie at a dozen other places in the area.

This is a great place to take co-workers you don't like, when you don't want them to know where you normally have lunch."}
{"text":"it was a great sports atmosphere. The pizza is ok.The service was good and the potatoe skins were awesome. good happy hour prices."}
{"text":"Man, my last review was pretty unfair. I was actually a fan of this place for a long time - I was just really bitter about not having that poker tournament to go to anymore. I loved it so. 

In my previous review, I threw around harsh names and whatnot at the owners - that was uncalled for and immature. Their food is good as I remember. I haven't actually been back in years - not since I wrote that last review. They didn't deserve that, and I'm only leaving it up to show what a jerk I was for writing it. Granted, I did have an awful experience that one night, but that wasn't the norm and every place has a bad night. Over the years, I've become much more understanding and tolerant of bad experiences like this. 

Sorry, Boston's. I take it all back."}
{"text":"I've tried to like this place, I really have. I've been there in person and once on GrubHub. It will be the last time I spend my money with Boston's. The beef dip tasted like old, frozen meat. It came with mushrooms and onions which weren't advertised on the menu. Mushrooms were like plastic, I could barely chew them. The onions were slimy. The bread was soggy which was a feat because the meat was dry. The two burgers we ordered were also VERY soggy, which to me means that the food sat on the counter for awhile. I usually like to write tongue in cheek reviews, just so people listen but I'm seriously warning you...Every time I go, the food is sub par."}
{"text":"Had Boston's delivered to my office today.  I was completely underwhelmed.  I've been to the location several times and had decent meals, but decided to try something new today.  I went with the Chicken Torino, and it was about worthy of one star.  Incredibly oily, with a tiny bit of rice and gobs of artichocke hearts.  The sauce was VERY lemony flavored, but not a great mix of anything else.  I did give it three stars because I've been there before and the dine in experience is miles beyond the delivery serivce."}
{"text":"Boston's is kind of on the same level as Applebee's for me.  Although Boston's food is a million times better, the atmosphere is kind of bland.

As for food, as I've said, it's pretty good but the portions are kinda small.  The pizza is okay.  I'd rather go to NYPD Pizza.  At least the nachos are fine.  

A plus about this place:  Happy Hour is a steal.  Cheap drinks, cheap food...  definitely worth trying!"}
{"text":"So two aspects of Boston's are at war with each other.

Price Vs. Taste/Value

Too bad price is winning. I ordered a medium buffalo pizza and two sodas. Cost was $25, $30 with tip. I've never, ever, paid $20 for a medium sized pizza with only two toppings (chicken and onions). It's horrifying!

But, you know what, if you want to spend the money the pizza did taste good. I enjoyed every bite.

And the customer service was great. The guy who took my order over the phone was really nice and my delivery guy was awesome. 

I will probably order from them again when I need the buffalo flavor, but otherwise I'll keep my money because I could have gotten a lot more for $30."}
{"text":"What sets one sports bar apart from the rest? It could be the brew on tap. Perhaps it's the size of the TV's. Possibly it's the sports memorabilia on the walls. What sets Boston's apart from the rest of the sports bars I've been to is, well, the comfortable feeling I get when I'm there. I'm allowed to drink my mammoth Oktoberfest Sam Adams and stare at the huge TV broadcasting the first game of the World Series - and I can do both without worrying about getting interrupted by rowdy patrons. The only noise I heard was clapping and cheering for the Red Sox. I'm down with that. 

My Boston experience was a first for me. I met a fellow Yelper out to catch the first part of Game One of the World Series. I was only nervous about the game - would the bar play it with sound? Yes! All my worrying was for naught, for they had the game on nearly all their TVs, minus a few that broad casted some NBA and NFL games. Didn't matter to me, as long as the World Series game was on with sound. 

I was asked what I wanted to drink. I wanted Sam Adams. Had to have Sam Adams. Perfect, they had Oktoberfest. I ordered a tall. Never mind the pint. I knew I was going to be there a while. What I didn't know what that \"tall\" meant \"tall and fat.\" This beer was HUGE. We're talking mammoth huge! \"Holy $h|t!\" I said when he plopped the delicious beer on my table. No way I was going to be able to drink that without food and drive home after the game. So, about 1/2 way into the mammoth beer, I ordered the Chicken Da Vinci pizza. Yum! 

When I finished off my huge beer, I ordered a pint of the same thing. Oh, why not? I felt comfortable at Boston's, so even when my new friend left, I was content to stay put for a while longer... especially to see the Red Sox spank the Rockies. 

Our server was friendly and attentive. He made sure our drinks were filled and our bellies were full. Plus, he wasn't in any rush to shoo me away from the game. He even made sure I had plenty of water to balance my consumption of beer. Ain't that sweet? 

When I staggered to the bathroom after my mammoth beer, I was amused to find the handles to the \"Hers\" to be a baseball bat. Simply perfect, yep.

I like Boston's. I'd definitely catch another WS game there. Come to think of it, I'd catch several other sports games there, too. Especially knowing I can drink 1/15th of my weight in a single glass!"}
{"text":"This is normal bar food, so you get what you would expect. I sat at the bar and the service was poor. It took forever for the bartender to take my order, and then for the food to arrive. She was walking around, talking to other employees & messing with the TV's, while I was patiently waiting for my food. I ordered an appetizer and a meal. When the food finally came out everything came at once instead of my appetizer first as anybody would want and should expect. So, I waited a long time and then the order was messed up. Shocker! I asked the bartender to put my main meal back under the heat while I ate my appetizer, which she did. However, when I was done with the appetizer it took me a while to find her again to tell her I was ready for my main meal. Expecting a timely refill wasn't even a thought on her mind either, but it didn't shock me at that point.

So, normal bar food and poor service."}
{"text":"The first time I as here was years ago and only for a couple of drinks after a show at ASU Gammage.  As I remember it was not very busy even then.  Last Friday we ventured into Boston's after plans we had didn't work out, as it turns out we should have just gone home.  On a Friday night at 7:00pm this place was empty, I thought we got lucky, not so much.  We ordered an appetizer which was tiny and expensive and not very good.  I won't really go into what we got for dinner, because really what's the point?  The food was barely edible.  The service was seriously lacking as well, it seemed like our waitress was even lest interested in being there than we were.  We will not return."}
{"text":"Was there late on Wednesday.I think we were the only table occupied in the entire place,which was fine because there were 4 kids in our party.They had coloring books,crayons and sippy cups for the kids which were great and kept them occupied.The waitress was friendly and attentive .
The food was nasty.Maybe they're known for their pizza,but I had the chicken sliders which were the consistancy of hocky pucks.The fries tasted old as well.
So,they get 2 stars for the crayons and wait staff...."}
