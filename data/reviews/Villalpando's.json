{"text":"My family and I went last weekend, we really enjoyed it.  The food was good, the service was good, and the prices were reasonable.  They have one of the best chips and salsa s out there. and the cheese dip was delicious.  I have very picky eaters in my family, and everyone found something they liked on the menu."}
{"text":"Went to Villalpando's with some friends because they like this restaurant.  I had no idea where it was, until we got there.  It's located at Chandler Blvd just east of I-10.  Years ago, it was a sports bar filled with TV's, but they are long gone.  I don't eat anything green (except peas), so finding something to eat there was a chore.  I normally have a red chili beef burrito when I go to a Mexican restaurant, but they only had green chili.  I ended up eating a bean and cheese burrito, which was very good.

I agree with the other reviews of this place... it's not bad, but not great. I'm sure my friends would disagree.  They love it.  The prices are fantastic.  For the beer drinkers, no beer on tap.  Only bottles.  Unlike the sports bar, I hope they survive, because the place was dead on a Friday night."}
{"text":"Went to check out this restaurant with my business partner for lunch, we are both big Mexican food junkies and were looking for something new. The first problem we encountered was that I looked at the map on Yelp to see where it was, and it was very, very wrong! The map showed it on Chandler Blvd. and Gilbert Rd., when it is really on Chandler and I-10, a BIG difference! Well, we finally got there around 1:00...the place was empty except for 3 tables. 

My first reaction to the menu was it was cheap!! I know lunch specials and so forth are generally cheap, but even the dinner menu was very well priced. They menu had a lot of Sonoran stand by's, as well as a whole seafood section that is not usually found at most places. 

The chips and salsa were really good. The chips were thin and crunchy and the salsa fresh. We asked for the hot salsa, and that came out with a side of bean dip as well. My business partner likes things the hotter the better....it was too hot for me...but she really like it. The bean dip was a little blah, but when mixed with the salsa it was good. 

I had the Mexican burrito, which was a shredded beef burrito, enchilada style with a queso sauce on top, with sour cream & guacamole. I really enjoyed it, it had good flavor. The beans that came on the side were good too, better than the bean dip. 

My business partner had the cheese crisp with green chilies, it looked like a really good cheese crisp, a lot of cheese and very crispy!! 

I would return for a repeat visit, but only if I was in the area, I wouldn't go out of my way for it. But the price was right, the bill for the two of us was $12.70!!"}
{"text":"I love this family-owned Mexican restaurant. The food is plenty authentic and not too spicy hot unless you ask for it. The service is always kind and attentive and they give you as much chips and salsa as you ask for. The prices are beyond reasonable and the food is delicious. It is the only clean, authentic Mexican restaurant I have ever been in. Every time we have family in town visiting we take them here. The downside for this place is location. It is hard to spot at the north-east corner of the I-10& Chandler in front of the Hampton, west of the Denny's."}
{"text":"Villalpando's is an ok place to have Mexican food. My lunch buddy and I go there often when we want a home cooked mexican meal. It's not spectacular, it's not bad. It's just ok. I usually get the green chile dinner. The meat is tender and it comes with rice, beans and 3 flour tortillas. My friend usually gets a chile relleno. She likes theirs because they aren't breaded and fried. So if you want simple, no frills, non-chain mexican food, hit up Villalpando's."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  It's a little different and usually not busy - but they are pretty new and in an area of town that just doesn't get that busy.  It's a huge place so it looks more empty than full.  Plus they are not advertising on TV and billboards like the only other competitors (chains) in the area.

I really like the salsa and the hot sauce.  One thing I really LOVE is the shrimp cocktail.  It is fabulous!  Fresh and full of shrimp.  I don't think I've ever had one in the Valley that has been as good.  It reminds me of sitting beach side in Mexico.  I go back often just for the shrimp cocktail.

My daughter is vegetarian and there are plenty of options for her, besides the standard vegetarian Mexican dishes of cheese enchilada and cheese quesadilla.

It's not fancy and it's not packed, but that is part of what I love about it!"}
{"text":"I had lunch at Villalpando's with a group of co-workers and this place is A-OK. The food wasn't spectacular, but everyone was satisfied with it and the prices are reasonable. The restaraunt was not very busy which makes it an easy place to go to with a large group. The service was friendly and had no problem with making substitutions to the menu items. I do like that they offer chile relleno that's not breaded and fried!"}
{"text":"Don't get out to Chandler much, but daughter has SAT exams, so afterward she was hungry. We found this little place nearby and it said family owned and we went in and the place was vacant almost. I said maybe we should leave, maybe the food is not good. Then a lady came by and said oh, the food is very good, it's just not busy this time of day. So we stayed had a late lunch and the chips and salsa were very good. We split a salad and a chicken quesadilla. The food was very good and the prices were very low. A little short on personnel that day, we had to hunt for somebody to pay our bill. Otherwise service was prompt and the food was fresh and flavorful. We would go back here, but would not drive to Chandler from North Phx. to eat here."}
{"text":"Okay, I don't understand how you can have nothing but good things to say about a place but then only give  a 2 star rating?!?!?!  That just doesn't make sense to me.

Monty and Paula and I try to make it out to lunch once a week since she left us stranded all alone at our building!  It was her turn to pick and she chose Villalpando's (of course butchering the name first - haha).  Monty and I were sceptical at first but said \"what the hell\"...  I'm glad we did because we were both very pleasantly surprised!  

The Food:  We both had the Speedy Gonzalez $5.95: one taco, one enchilada, rice and beans.  I had shredded beef (choice of shredded or ground) and he had chicken.  Paula had the special, one shredded beef enchilada, rice and and beans.  

After eating a ton of chips and salsa, which were very good - the salsa had a little kick, tasted fresh, and the chips were thin, salty and crispy the way I like them - we got to our meals.  My taco was great!  Nice crunchy corn tortilla filled with tasty shredded beef, topped with lettuce, tomato and shredded cheese.  YUMMY!  I told myself that I would save my enchilada for later but I ended up being a big fat pig and eating EVERYTHING, save for a few spoonfuls of rice since I'm not a big spanish rice lover.  The enchilada was also very good.  The same shredded beef inside a corn tortilla, coated with a red sauce that was very good, not canned, and flavorful, sprinkled (not encased) in a little cheese.  The sauce was almost as good as mine!  The beans were tasty (also NOT CANNED).  The rice was ok, kinda plain, but like I said, I'm not big on spanish rice.

The Price:  Very reasonable.  Our entire bill was about 30 bucks, including two drinks and two to-go orders of churros!

The Service:  Very friendly waiter, maybe could have come around to check a little more, but nice - and the food came out fast.

The cashier was very very nice.  We let her know how much we enjoyed ourselves and that we would be back soon.  She was appreciative. :o)

Atmosphere:  Clean, airy, pleasant.  Didn't use the facilities, so I can't comment.

I will definitely be back to Villalpando's... have to take my mom after our horrible experience at another Mexican place (see my review from last week)!"}
{"text":"This place was fantastic.  We were skeptical when we noticed that the parking lot was empty (as was the restaurant).  However, we both ordered the fajitas (mine were veggie, and my husband's were shrimp), and they were wonderful!  The chips (thin and crisp) and the salsa (poured from a cute little decanter) were an excellent start to a simply delicious meal.  Our waiter was very nice and attentive.  
I would definitely recommend this restaurant for its service and its food."}
{"text":"It's so great to find one restaurant that's NOT a chain. I feel so bad because they are always empty inside when we get there. The chips and salsa are tasty, the food has always been good. I've been there twice, with two other people both times and everyone in my party has always enjoyed their meal. Their menu is large and varied and they do have an \"A la carte\" section. Another great thing that I just discovered last night, they have a sweet happy hour with $1 9oz. margaritas, that's right, you heard me, A DOLLAR!! The service has always been friendly and helpful, albeit the gentleman who served us last night didn't have much to say, but he seemed just shy more than anything else. It's clean, friendly, tasty and cheap. Go give it a try! Help support something other than the Applebees, Taco Bell, Panda Express and the countless other chain restaurants that are ubiquitous in Ahwatukee!!"}
{"text":"I have been searching diligently since moving to AZ to find great Mexican food, and I have yet to find it. However, this place is GOOD. I too embarked upon an empty parking lot. My friend and I entered the restaurant to find it completely empty. After walking around trying to find someone to seat and serve us the hostess appeared out of no where and stated he locked himself outdoors and did not have his key to get back in.  Any who, we contemplated leaving due to the \"lack of service,\" but I had completed my Yelp homework and saw that this was the norm. We were seated, our drink orders taken and left with the menu to make our decisions.
The food...
The shrimp cocktail was wonderful and full of shrimp although a tad bit sweet. I added more lime juice and this helped. The carnitas was flavorful, beans and rice were not bad at all. My friend had enchiladas and a tamale both of which were tasty as well. This will be my new spot for Mexican food. It is so true when they say, \"don't judge a book by its cover.\"  This is by far not the best Mexican food that I have had but it will definitely suffice..."}
