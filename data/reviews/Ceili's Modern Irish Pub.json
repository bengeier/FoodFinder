{"text":"Ok service, okay food. It is nice to have somewhere lively to go in the NW instead of having to head downtown!"}
{"text":"Shitty service, servers just drank and texted on their phones the whole time.. Took 15 minutes to get our drinks served and then close to 45 minutes to get our food. Get your act together and act professional.. Downtown location puts you guys to shame.."}
{"text":"This place can really be hit or miss depending on who is working. My wife and I frequent a few times a month and find each visit to be inconsistent. The owner is very attentive, but sometimes overwhelming and lacks hospitality etiquette (ie: serving a beer sample in a wine glass, eating bar garnishes while at the bar) . Depending on who is serving you there is a range of competencies among staff members. Some servers seem to have stayed with the restaurant for years while others are brand new and poorly trained. If you have ever been to the downtown locations, this place is day and night- atmosphere, beer consistency, food quality. There is definitely a lack of professionalism among managers whom we presume are the owners inexperienced children.   Unfortunately, there are not many options in the area and as such we occasionally pop in. In recent months we've noticed a significant decline in occupancy while dining. If you're looking for an upbeat, fun and BUSY atmosphere, this is certainly not your spot. Across the street at Mad Rose Pub we find the environment more entertaining. Also, although they classify as a \"pub\" there are always children in the place and it can be irritating when trying to enjoy a beer and watch the game. In my opinion Ceili's Royal Oak is experiencing a bit of an identity crisis supplemented by poor management and inconsistent product."}
{"text":"Went for dinner and a drink for the first time on a Friday evening around 5:30p. Was seated immediately and had drinks in front of us in less than 5 mins. After checking out the food menu and discovering quite a few gluten free choices (celiac) I was pleased. The burger with gluten free bun was tasty, albeit messy to eat, the house salad was fresh and the dressing had a nice bite to it. My dining companion ordered the fish tacos, which were also very tasty. The only weird and unsettling thing about the experience were the four children under 12 yrs of age at the table next to us. I am a mother myself and love kids but was completely taken aback by the fact that they were in a Pub. Won't be returning for this very reason because when I choose a pub or lounge to dine at, I do so to have a getaway from the kids. Not cool Ceili's, just a very bad mix. If they had a separate restaurant side it would be better."}
{"text":"This restaurant usually has great food. We always enjoy our trips here. The nachos are great, and the burgers are fantastic. The only complaint that I would have, is that their clam chowder is awful. Normally I would not even make a mention of such a thing, but when I brought it to the waitresses attention that this clam chowder was so bad, she did not seem to care and did not remove it from our bill.To be fair, everything on the menu is of great quality and always tastes beautiful. This was quite a surprise to me to have something that was not up to standards.The part that disappointed me was not that it was a seven dollar item that was not taken off my menu, but the fact that the staff did not seem to think it was a big deal.I will definitely think twice before ordering something unfamiliar from the menu."}
{"text":"Been here a few times to sit down grab a beer and watch a game.  To food is descent and the beer selection is good. They have run out of things I've ordered in the past which is never a good thing but would offer other menu items I would potentially like otherwise.  The staff seems professional enough and I've never had to wait to long for my drinks and food. They dealt with our very large group once quite well.  This place is nothing exceptional but good over all. But the parking is VERY limited, I've had to drive around quite a bit in the past to finally find a parking spot."}
{"text":"Went here last night (a Friday after work) for dinner and a drink and had a very positive experience.  We were greeted and seated very promptly by the owner who seemed genuinely concerned about where we would like to sit and asked if we wanted the channel changed on the tv nearest us.  We said we wouldn't mind watching the Jays game and he happily changed the channel immediately.  Our server was good...brought us what we needed and was pleasant about it, which is all I ask of a good server.  I had the beef dip and thought it was yummy.  The beef was not fatty or tough, and the jus was tasty.  The fries were crispy and overall, I was very happy with my menu selection.  I've tried quite a few beef dips over the years, and this one was right up there with the best of them.  My husband had the fish n chips and was also happy with his meal.  We will be back...we even commented that if we lived in Royal Oak we would absolutely make this our neighbourhood pub, as it was very welcoming and the food, drinks, and service were great...all at a decent price."}
{"text":"Plus sides: lots of tables, nice decor and our server was friendly.  Downsides: kind of pricy for the quality  We were skeptical to try here because the one by us on Southland closed and my parents weren't happy the first time they came to this one, but the other couple of times they were satisfied.  It's almost worth 5 stars just for the appetizer of macaroni and cheese sticks!!!! Seriously they are cheesy, breaded deep fried godliness. I could've eaten an order to myself! I wished I had instead of the mediocre seared ahi tuna tacos I tried. Firstly I had maybe an ounce of tuna of each taco (there were 3). The amount on all three combined still would've been just barely enough for one. I found the flavours odd with the pickled ginger mayo and jalapenos which at first I thought were pickles. And my tortillas were hard, not in a stale way but i couldn't roll them so it was difficult to eat!  The sweet potato fries were tasty also. My husband enjoyed his chicken club sandwich with clam chowder but wouldn't order it again.  Overall there's better out there... but I would go back for those mac n cheese sticks!!!!"}
{"text":"Very busy but we only had to wait 15 minutes for a table. The food was okay however the service was great. Will try this location again hoping the food is better next time."}
{"text":"Great location in Royal Oak, upscale, new pub feel, friendly staff - almost too friendly. Our waitress was overly touchy-feely but we just ignored it. It was hard to ignore however the that the guys we were with wanted beer and due to New Years Eve a couple of days prior, they were out of about 70% of their beer selections!!!  I had a very weak martini that was supposed to be 2oz, but no way-jose was it so. My next one was better, I switched it up a bit to a regular martini instead of one from their drink menu but man, at $9.25 each, they are not worth it. Which takes me to my next point - this place is PRICEY! Yes, I know this is Calgary, I know it is Royal Oak but this will certainly affect how often we come here. For the same price as a meal and drinks here, I could fine-dine in downtown Cow-town. I asked and was told that everything is pretty much homemade in the kitchen.  I had a 1 piece fish and chip dish for $11.95 plus extra for a wee bit of gravy. It was forgettable but there was nothing wrong with it either. The pub was not too busy on a Fri night, it had a decent vibe and overall, it was OK. Most importantly, we all had a good time!"}
{"text":"Very unimpressed. Fish in the fish and chips is sourced from China. Cutlery wasn't provided, I had to go find our server. Drink specials listed on menu were not in effect for no apparent reason. When you ask for a drink with light ice, that means three quarters of the glass filled with ice. Perhaps their regular drinks come as a block of ice....  Food was meh. Wouldn't bother, there are way beter pubs out there with nice staff and ambiance."}
{"text":"Food Is Decent But Not For The Price. Service Is Kind Of Slow. Lots Of Chairs But Not Comfortable."}
{"text":"Good food. Pathetic service.  No one in the bar and the waitresses would rather visit with each other than do their job."}
{"text":"Ceili's keeps tricking me...  delicious sounding dishes lure me to order food again and again and then I find myself so very disappointed with my food.   Nothing I've had tastes that great and it's not inexpensive.   Asian bowl - downing in salty sauce with all chance of flavor over watered and salted.  veggie burger - bland and soggy patties flat bread - so under whelming I can't remember anything about it.  So I guess it was just forgettable.    Over all I just have to remember to eat before going to Ceili's and it'll be fine.  Everything else here is not bad to good.    A curious thing though,  I think they are doing some human cloning here.  Last trip in I looked around and noticed there were 5 servers that were all pretty much identical and I couldn't figure out which served me (I usually have a knack for faces)  The girls and bartenders all seem to be of a very specific type more so than more places I hang out.  Maybe this gets them male business but as a female I generally see this as a women's issue and a problem in a corporate hiring practise."}
{"text":"I ordered the buffalo burger with beer batter onion rings, 2nd time, buffalo burger with fries.  One issue I had, if you substitute any other choice for fries, they charge you $2 and for $1 they give you a cap full of gravy.  Great food, properly seasoned, cooked and good portions.  The bun and garnish were fresh.  The waitress' are friendly, seem to care about your experience and look good in their uniform ;)"}
{"text":"Probably the best pub in Royal oak. Great pub food. Menu seems to change a bit every time I go in. Keeps thing fresh and new.   Great drink specials.  A little disappointed that they don't have certain beers on tap that they had when the opened.   Great environment. Games are always on and sound is available when asked."}
