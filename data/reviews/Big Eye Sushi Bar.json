{"text":"As everybody says the happy hour choices are great. The staff is also very welcoming and nice. The problem is that there was only 1 person making the sushi, which is probably the reason why it took forever to get our orders."}
{"text":"Sushi is fresh and fun environment. Happy hour all day and a reasonable menu. The sushi chefs really know their stuff. I would recommend this place for King Kong roll, big eye roll, citrus Hamachi roll...excellent!"}
{"text":"We have watched business' come and go at this location for a few years now.  When I saw that it is now a sushi restaurant, I had my reservations.  During the day you cannot see into the shop because of the tinted windows, but don't let that stop you from seeing and tasting what's inside.    We sat ourselves at the bar and were greeted very warmly from the waitress and soon afterwords, the sushi chef.  It happened to be happy hour at the time with extremely reasonable prices.  Happy hour is everyday of the week from 4-6:30pm.  What great deals!  Sake bombers were only $6 and you can choose from a variety of appetizers; such as edamame, calamari, and gyoza, to name a few.  I had to have the edamame, and the calamari was scrumptious as well.  It was served with a yummy aioli sauce that paired with it perfectly.  Not only were there appetizers on the happy hour menu, but there were some sushi rolls to choose from too.  We tried the shrimp tempura roll and wow, the shrimp had an amazing light batter that had a lovely crunch!   Besides happy hour, we had to experiment more from the sushi menu.  The Surfer was amazing; that was one of my favorites.  The dynamite shrimp on top was delectable with it's spicy zing.  It was hard not to eat all the shrimp on its own without the roll!  If you like spicy, you would also like the yellow fin tuna with sauteed jalapenos.  It's served with a delightful soy garlic sauce.  It was a little misleading, because we thought it was going to be a roll.  However, it was extremely fresh and tasty, but a little overpriced for all that you got.  On the adventurous side, the quail egg was phenomenal!  It was served in a shot glass and I have to admit, I wasn't sure how to proceed.  After taking the plunge into my mouth, I found that all the components went together extremely well and the creaminess from the quail egg only added to the delicacy of it.  I would definitely get that again and perhaps experiment a little more with what else they had to offer.    I am very happy to have found a sushi bar that keeps my taste buds wanting more.  Service was excellent.  My glass never reached empty, and it was never a nuisance to stop our waitress and ask for something.  The atmosphere was mediocre.  I felt that there could have been more charm, especially with the big screen televisions playing football.  Personally, I could have done without and maybe been more entertained with anime.  However, this sushi hot spot is off to a good start and I hope they will be around longer than their predecessors."}
{"text":"What an amazing little find!! We found this spot thru Groupon (a great deal btw) and were very pleased with everything we had. Our favorite were these delightful balls of flavor in the corners of the plate. Melt in your mouth and delightfully fresh salmon with a wonderfully spicy creamy sauce topped with just the right amount of crunch! Definitely our new go to spot for sushi!"}
{"text":"Well...   the staff was great - our server a sweetheart.  But first they tried to serve us watered down vodka on the rocks - with a lame excuse.  And then the fish on some of the pieces of sashmi was crunchy, tasted fishy, and very thin.  Sadly, it appears BE is on shakey ground, or so it seems.   For the money - head on over to Sushi Brokers."}
{"text":"The server seemed strung out and the water tasted like dishes had been washed in it. The overall service was NOT good at all and the place was dead, took us 40 minutes to get our rolls after finding out the waitress forgot to initially input out order to the sushi bar. We may have been able to overlook it if the sushi was at least mediocre, however that was not the case. After seeing our upset the waitress offered soup \"on the house\" but by that point we didn't want to taste anything else they had to offer. Don't give the place a try unless you are looking to pay full price for a terrible dining experience."}
{"text":"Hands down, the BEST sushi in Phx metro area... Have been going since they opened, and it did take a while for them to fine-tune their staff/service, it's always been worth the wait for the amazing food.   We moved to South Scottsdale a little over a year ago, so we started going to other sushi restaurants that were closer, or that seemed more convenient, and sometimes just to try someplace new, but they were all just mediocre.  We returned to Big Eye tonight because we were in the neighborhood,  and it was busy... Not bursting at the seems, but busy... The staff were all super friendly and helpful, the service was spot-on, and the food was TO DIE FOR as always!   Big Eye, please open a location in South Scottsdale!!!"}
{"text":"2nd rate sushi and service, got the order wrong but totally made good in it. For a quick snack it's ok, but not for a date or a sushi conneseur. service is also slow, but very polite. Don't come here if your in a hurry."}
{"text":"My wife and I always look for good neighborhood spots close to our home and after debating on Big Eye for about six months we took the plunge and ordered some take out.  I normally do not order take out sushi but we live just around the corner so we took a chance.  First of all, I almost never eat at restaurants that are not very busy especially a sushi place.  But I broke my own rule....never again.  They were about 15 minutes late with my food even though I could count the number of gusts in the place on one hand.  Second, while sitting at the bar I was never greeted by anyone or asked if I wanted something while I waited, bad service.  When I did finally get the food and took it home I was a little shocked when I opened things up.   I'm going to spare you all the details but will say that this stuff was NOT fresh at all!  I have seen some sushi that is a little questionable from a freshness standpoint but this stuff smelled bad.   We took one for the team at this place!  Needless to say, there are much better places to get your sushi fix in Scottsdale.  Oh by the way, we threw the whole meal out and ordered a pizza!  I would watch your step at this place we will not try again!"}
{"text":"The food, though small in portion, was quite good, however a bit overpriced for its skimpy size. My review is as much for the delivery as the portion size. Not all of our order arrived although we had pre paid (including tip through seamless), the driver apparently cannot decipher the mystery of an address so our order required several phone calls, and there was no time to verify if everything had arrived. Even superior food can't make up for the food we didn't get or how long we were made to wait for it. In fact the experience was so taxing it wouldn't have felt worth it to even trouble ourselves with attempting to get our missing items. When we are next in Scottsdale we'll be trying anything but 'big' (a misnomer) eye sushi."}
{"text":"\"Expensive, below average, small portion sushi\" 2/5  We were excited about this new sushi place close to our home last week and decided to give it a try. When we walked in the restaurant around 6pm, we were the first group of customer in the restaurant. The server was nice by taking our seating us and taking orders.   We chose 3 types of sushi rolls - cucumber roll, special roll with salmon and cream cheese and an eel roll. My sis ordered a chicken-katsu. The rolls were pretty disappointing as they were very small rolls in size and not much of raw fish (sashimi) on top. It tasted like something that you could have gotten from the grocery store sushi section but a lot more expensive at Big Eye. One special roll is about $13 to $15 (only tiny 5-6 slices). My sis's chicken-katsu tasted better than sushi but the price was a bit steep as well ($12 or $13). I guess this is Scottsdale price! Oh well, we had definitely tasted better sushi with the same price.   I would not recommend this place to any friends but might give it a try again in a year or two."}
{"text":"Loved the sushi!! I went on my birthday with my brother and had some really good rolls. They were so good we ended up getting 5 or 6 rolls to split between the 2 of us, plus an appetizer, and drinks. Even with all of that food, I think we spent $50 and then tipped.  The only down side is that the service was pretty slow considering we were 1 of 2 tables in there. But we did come at an off hour - it was like 3pm, no restaurant expects anybody in at 3. Also, no flavored Saki (which I was craving).  Love the sushi, OK with the service. I actually recommended this restaurant to my other brother and his fiance. I will be back :)"}
{"text":"What a wonderful surprise to find this gem in the middle of Cactus country 10 minutes away from me! Japanese and Korean food? In Scottsdale? Just went for the first time last week; wish we'd tried this place long ago. The salmon and tuna sashimi were excellent. The Fire Chicken was OK if you like Korean spicy sauce slathered on chicken breast. But, since I'm a sashimi lover, I give this place a 4 stars. Can't wait to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"Great food, great all day happy hour prices, and very friendly service. I get a friendly greeting as soon as I walk in the door. It's a very nice neighborhood restaurant."}
{"text":"So excited to use my first groupon.    First off, the sushi was great.  The manger (sushi chef) was super nice and fun to talk with.   With that being said, the waitress staff was less then desired.    Very slow, less then attentive, and a bit rude.  I was not impressed and left a much larger tip for the sushi chef.    It was even more of a disappointment once I found out that the owner was there and clearly had observed us, or at least noticed us.  We were having a good time (despite the lack in service).   He made no attempt to acknowledge the lack of service we were getting.  Keep in mind that we were there to see the change from happy hour to dinner.   There were a few times we were the only two in there.  I will return to use our second groupon, hopefully service will be better.  I think the $25.00 discount in a $125.00 bill would be worth better customer service."}
{"text":"The worst service I have ever had at any sushi restaurant.  From the minute we walk in and sat ourselves to the 80 degree temp in which we almost started to break a sweat while eating.  The food was good for the price but the service was crap.  My wife and I ordered 4 rolls, after they brought the first two 20 minutes later we had to hunt someone down to get them to the table and ask where our the other rolls we ordered.  The waiter says we ran out of eel was there something else you wanted.  Are you kidding me.  No apology no communication and no service.  What kind of establishment is this?  This was the worst service I have ever experienced in any sub par restaurant.  Just to comment on the layout, it feels somewhat like an upscale McDonald's."}
{"text":"Great place for cheap sushi, but I got an uncomfortable vibe here.  Dirt cheap Saturday lunch specials.  $6 specials including 2 8pc sushi rolls. The tootsie was especially good.  Food service is a little slow and the rolls weren't put together that great as I don't think all the cooks are experienced in sushi making--still, I'm not picky about my sushi, plenty good enough for me.  Jason, the owner, is friendly and was very attentive as a server, but what got me here is that I felt a little pressured to order more food, as if I was taking advantage of them by only spending $6 on the lunch special.  I also used the free Yelp ice cream dessert special which only made me feel more awkward.  Some of this might have just been in my head, but I can't lie about how I felt, they didn't make me feel comfortable let's put it that way.  The owner truly is a nice guy, but I felt like he didn't want to honor the deals he advertised which is inappropriate.  Seeing the lunch specials outside the door are what changed my mind from going to that restaurant vs another I was planning to go to, so at least I spent my money there.    Bottom line, if you want cheap sushi and won't think twice about taking advantage of the deals they advertise (which you probably shouldn't), go here on Saturdays for lunch!"}
{"text":"As someone who always appreciates the hard work that servers go through day in and day out, this was the first time in my 39 years of life, that I paid the bill with ZERO tip.  Honestly, it was such a surreal experience with the completely oblivious attitude of the server, I can't put it into words.  The sushi was actually very good, but, wow, the server gal was dumbfounding.  She  was slow, non-responsive, and spoke in cryptic language, while my wife and I looked at each other like we were watching an odd movie or immersed in a nightmare of a dream...  Wow....."}
{"text":"Food was great! Very fresh sushi. Had chimi & surfer and both were delicious. Our server was sweet & attentive. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Our favorite local spot for sushi. The staff is so welcoming and the sushi chefs are friendly and beyond talented. Definitely sit up at the bar and chat with them and the other guests, it makes for an enjoyable meal.  The sashimi is always fresh and spot on. Beware if you order the Surfer as it's both a roll and a cocktail. But either way, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I have to admit it, I am a regular. I show up at least once a week, sometimes two or three times. It is very close to my house, and I always get great service from the chefs-- Fuji, John and Yohan.  The beer is made even better by chilled mugs. Spicy tuna never disappoints... couple that with some other rolls and I'm off to the races!!! The hand rolls that Yohan prepares are insanely delicious!! Try a spicy tuna with tempura shrimp and avocado!!  Three varieties of premium sake and soju are available for your delight, as is a bar, draft Sapporo and Kirin, and a selection of red and white wines... LOVE THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE service! The food is pretty good...good prices for lunch. But I cant believe how long it takes to get a couple of orders of sashimi. It took us approx 1 hr 45 min to get our complete order, which wasn't much. We will never go back just because of the poor service."}
{"text":"I bought a Groupon for $20 with a $42.90 value including drinks and dinner for two. Drinks means sodas and dinner for two is ONE specialty roll. One roll is one meal not two but they would only include one. Value turned out to be less then $30 not the $42.90. I think they misled on purpose and we'll never be back. Also has martini on menu but tasted more like dishwater so sent back."}
{"text":"Stopped by randomly on my way home from running errands the first time I came in... What a great find!  The lollipop roll, surfer roll, chicken yakitori all delicious and great presentation."}
{"text":"Do not go here!  This place does't know how to run a business, I am amazed they are still open.  When we were seated (before we even sat down) I was asked what we would like to drink, um.. can I look at the menu first?  Also there was a total of 9 people in the restaurant including me and my husband.  I have patience of a saint, but the service here is ridiculous slow for how dead it was.  The server who could use a talking to about personality and a needs to check her attitude at the door RAN everywhere, very unprofessional.  Even though this establishment is right down the street, we will NEVER, EVER be back.  There are too many good restaurants in the area than to settle for sub par sushi with sh*tty staff.  You might also want to change your elevator music, as it was loud and awful!!!    Also...after reading more Yelp reviews, the poor service is the only thing constant with this place!  Maybe instead of the manager \"replying\" to all the COMPLAINTS...he should be in the restaurant trying to teach his rude amateur staff!"}
{"text":"I don't know what the reason is for all the poor reviews, but this restaurant deserves 5 stars. One server for 5 tables, but he was extremely friendly and accommodating. We wanted for nothing. Most people want sushi as it comes out. In fact I've never been to a sushi restaurant where it all comes out at the same time. The point of sushi is that it's supposed to be fresh. I don't want sashimi and rolls on the table all at once, getting warm and dry... ew. The sashimi was impressive - for it's freshness and taste and size. We also got spicy tuna and salmon rolls and were equally satisfied. OH... and they play amazing music. Plus right now they have happy hour all day, everyday. Go... unless you're super picky and actually believe that Vegas and Tootsie rolls qualify as \"sushi.\""}
{"text":"Super friendly staff and great food too. Sometimes it takes a few minutes to get the rolls out, but it's always worth the wait. Love the Surfer Roll, King Kong roll, Yummy roll and Red Dragon roll too. We are never disappointed after a meal here....we love Big Eye!"}
{"text":"We had an absolutely terrible experience.  Over priced in every way.   Bill for 2 at lunch was $54.00 and we had two rolls, two ice tea.  It was a complete waste."}
{"text":"We stopped in for dinner this evening and had an amazing experience. Even though we were there late the service was outstanding and the sushi was some of the best I've ever had. We had the Jalepeno poppers and Pork Gyoza to start and both were great. After our starter we did a mix of sashimi and a few different rolls and everything was excellently prepared and very fresh. Manager Jason was very attentive and ensured everything was perfect for our dinner. If you haven't had Big Eye Sushi definitely make the trip."}
{"text":"Delicious! Every time we are here we get the tootsie, it is amazing!!!,  today we tried ramen, it is delicious too. Every time we come here we leave very happy , M is really nice. I definitely recommend this place. Thanks!!"}
{"text":"The food here was delicious. The service and wait staff are awful, and the waitresses and cook seemed to be more interested in flirting and sneaking a bottle of Tito's in and out of the kitchen. However, there was a shining light in the experience. Joshua, the sushi preparer was excellent conversation, and even though the waitress wrote my order down incorrectly, he let me keep the wrong sushi for free.   If I were to ever return here, it would be because of the excellent service and sushi from Joshua. The rest of the fraternizing, inept staff the were working on a Friday night should be replaced by people that pay attention to their customers."}
{"text":"Condescending service and sub par service."}
{"text":"The sushi here is so good you order sushi after great sushi it's the best. Big eye is a real nice calm place where you can order a bunch of stuff for a low price."}
{"text":"Taking down 1 star, sorry.  This place may be suffering from lack of traffic (?), meaning that maybe they are keeping product a tad longer than the should....not that anything was bad.  Serving size still good. California roll...amateurishly made, I think I could have done better.  Background music sucked, not what I want to listen to while eating.  We will still go back here because it's easy. But, there are much better places for same price within short drive.  And, all day still is Happy Hour."}
{"text":"I've been here maybe 3 times and every time I hoped it would get better but no. Worst sushi I've ever had and even worse service. The servers are not attentive and will disappear to the back for what seems like hours if you're wanting a refill. The sushi chef made my plate and left it sitting at his station while he walked to the back and I watched flies crawling all over my food (I did not eat it when he finally gave it to me). Needless to say, I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Would have left 4 stars but service continues to get worse and worse. Used to go there and server knew what we drank and apps we started with. Last time walked in and sat down, wasn't acknowledged and took 15 min to receive a drink. Total of 35 min and wasn't even brought a menu. Server was lucky I paid for drink before walking out. I'll gladly go to another place and pay more. It's a shame because this place used to be really great."}
{"text":"As many of the reviews here on Yelp and other sites have consistently stated about Big Eye.. the SERVICE is HORRIBLE.  This COULD be a decent place since the food is not that bad, BUT with one sushi chef and one server (on most days) this place needs to think about service because people are not going to wait 1-2 hours for a meal (and this is a consistent problem at BIg Eye)."}
{"text":"Very good!! I've been looking for a good sushi place after a few bad trips to our local sushi restaurant. I'm not really into rolls, I prefer lots of raw fish. Everything was very fresh and delicious! I also liked the sashimi specials they had. It seemed pretty slow for a Saturday night though! I see some people left bad reviews but there wasn't anything unpleasant about my dinner there. Fresh fish, attentive service, and a vast sushi menu. I hope more people come and try this place, I will definitely be back and recommending it to friends! Keep it up Bigeye Sushi!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good actually but the service was brutal. Never did get our final roll which was their specialty roll that looked good on the menu. The capper was when I raised my hand like I was in grade school for service and still was not acknowledged.  My wife had to walk up to the waitress stand to ask for several things and they acted pretty ho hum like we didn't matter. Pretty competitive restaurant market in Scottsdale. They probably should make it at least appear like they care."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, good lunch specials that are very affordable, and it's right next to 24 hour fitness! No feeling guilty after eating too much which is always a plus :)"}
{"text":"Arrived at 5:30p on a Friday. No greeter so we found our own table (place had 1 other table with 2 guests). A waiter finally approached to take our order. She was new and didn't know the menu so she couldn't answer any questions. A second waiter approached 4 minutes later - he also could not answer our simple questions. We laughed and decided to order - should have taken that as a hint to just leave (during this time a 3rd table arrived and was never greeted so they just got up and left after almost waiting 10 minutes). Some of our food finally arrived after 20 minutes - when asked where the rest was the waiter looked at us with a perplexed thought running through his head. Minutes later the wrong dish arrived. My Arnold Palmer finally arrived after half way through our meal and my correct sushi roll finally arrived 5 minutes after my drink. The waiter said the owner (who was making the sushi behind the bar) got the order wrong. Haha! They did not offer to take anything off our bill after everything - instead they charged us for items we never ordered. The service is an F. The ownership/management is an F-. The food is a D+. The ambience is a D. Clearly we will never be back."}
{"text":"Good sushi- not great, but good. It's nice that they are open late. Ate here once only when we first moved into Scottsdale. The waitress was nice but service was disappointing. If they want to sell their food they definitely need to make sure they check in with customer every now and then and to ask if we want more food or rolls even drinks. The great part tho was they had a DJ the night we went. If I had a last option late night sushi plan it wud definitely be here. By the way the waitress now works at zipps across the street!"}
{"text":"This place is great.  Top to bottom awesome and friendly staff. Sushi is freakin outstanding and even  if you bring a groupon you still won't get skimped on the sushi like some places. Red Dragon Roll is DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"I truly enjoy this place. Their sushi is fantastic and unique, but I come back mostly for the cucumber salad weirdly enough. I'm obsessed with the dressing! The many times I have been here it never seems to get too busy - maybe it's because I go at less busy hours, though it is an relaxed, casual atmosphere, and the service has never been anything less than great."}
{"text":"Small portions, average at best.  Service was mediocre.  Would not repeat.  Much better sushi elsewhere."}
{"text":"food, was ok, terrible service, 47 degrees outside and 53 degrees inside.  The heat was broken but we were not told before sitting down and ordering.  It was cold! I will not go back.  Nothing memorable."}
{"text":"This was our second time in and we absolutely loved it! It's a really simple ambience and not very large but the food is amazing! Everything we had was as fresh as I've ever had, the sushi chef Sam was so nice and made us feel so welcomed. I asked to modify two of the rolls and that was no problem. It's not the most trendy place but hands down has better sushi than any of the more \"trendy\" places we've been to. The quality of the food is what really stood out, and the prices are extremely reasonable. You'd pay considerably more at other Scottsdale sushi places. If your looking for top quality sushi and reasonable prices this is it. I'm glad we found this and we will be back.  Patrick  Scottsdale Az"}
{"text":"All day, every day happy hour!  Was very impressed by Big Eye Sushi Bar. At first glance, you would think this is a Japanese restaurant, but it is actually Korean that serves sushi (not mad about it!). We were greeted immediately and sat at the bar. The waiter was very friendly, providing helpful recommendations.  Starting off with Edamame, Miso Soup, and Gyoza (pan fried), all were delicious.  Entree's were the black tiger roll (must have) and the Dolsot Bibimbap. My only critism would be the Dolsot was slightly over cooked, being that it is served in a hot pot.  Other than that, the experience was great and we plan to be back!"}
{"text":"Sheryl wanted sushi for dinner, and there are a LOT of sushi places in Scottsdale. While we were driving, she found a Groupon for this place. For $20, we got 2 specialty rolls, edamame and sake. They also have happy hour all day every day, and we ordered some dumplings. We left stuffed, that's for sure. The place was packed and a lot of people are complaining about the service. We didn't have an issue with service at all. They play top 40 tunes, which I could do without... But this place is legit. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Let me first say this... I'm not one to post a lot of reviews, but this place deserves it!! I started going to Big Eye because it was close to my condo and it was good. I stopped going there for bit of time because I had to move and there was a close by sushi restaurant (a very popular one) that is literally 2 mins away from me. It's ok, not great. But, I saw pictures from Facebook that Big Eye was posting of some new menu items and they looked amazing. I decided it was worth the 15-20 min drive to go back, and I'm so glad I did. They have completely stepped up their game! Their food is AMAZING!! I get take out from them once a week. I could go the very short distance to the other place but why spend the money for sub-par food . The staff  at Big Eye is awesome! It is family owned and it shows. They treat me to a free appetizer ( because I'm a \"regular\")  even with a take out order. WOW!  The chef and staff are top notch, not to mention the food which is excellent ! Go there immediately, you will be happy you did!!"}
{"text":"This is one of the BEST Sushi restaurants in Scottsdale.  Extremely mellow atmosphere- so if you are looking to 'party' then this is NOT your place.  But, if you at a serious sushi fan and looking for FRESH and DELICIOUS sushi that is not only family friendly, but LOCALLY owned and operated ... then this is your place."}
{"text":"Our favorite local sushi place. Always pleases, often exceeds expectations. Definitely try the iced flavored sake."}
{"text":"Very nice and friendly staff. Food is always fresh and yummy.  Good neighborhood spot for romantic quick getaway with my hubby."}
{"text":"Worst customer service and really pore quality. I went in one night 45 minuets to close and they said they were closed . Then a different night me and my fiancé were the only ones there in the restaurant. And they messed up our order and over charged us which I had to point out to our server . Just not impressed and won't ever be back . Not to mention the health code director in the area told us afterward don't go there again ."}
{"text":"Placed looked lively for a week night. The sushi we ordered was on Happy Hour and was pretty good. The reason I only gave this place a 3 is because our order took 20 minutes, with the last dish being the appetizer."}
{"text":"I went there recently, and my wife and I had a great meal. The place is not fancy, but the service was very good as was the food. We had salads, Vegetable Tempura, and some Sushi Rolls. We probably didn't wait more that 5 minutes for any course. Price was slightly high, but there were some specials that were a good deal. We would definitely go back, especial for lunch. My wife, who is not big on Japanese food really liked it as well, but we had pretty mild offerings, like the Crunchy Roll. Overall, we really liked the place."}
{"text":"The waitress was super sweet but the food was lacking taste. One of my dishes had a bug in it, the other dish we asked to not have a certain food item inside due to an allergy come out with the food item we requested to not be in it. The salmon skin roll was basically just salmon and no skin, it was dry and not very appetizing. Some of the other rolls were good and the gyoza was semi cold inside."}
{"text":"This place has the best salmon sashimi anywhere. They have the most accommodating staff. I'm gluten free and they will adjust everything to work with your allergies and special diet. Best fresh fish in town!"}
{"text":"Completely and totally unimpressed and quite disappointed.  The sushi is low quality (I'm quite the sushi nut) and the prices are quite high.  The place was dirty and the staff was rude and non attentive.    The food itself lacks taste and was put together really quickly.    We got the Vegas, Tootsie, Philadelphia and salmon rolls and usually are quite happy with that selection in other establishments but wished we would have just gone somewhere entirely different."}
{"text":"Overpriced and the portions are tiny.  Need I say more ?  There are so many other great sushi places in Scottsdale, don't waste your time & money at Big Eye."}
{"text":"This was such a wonderful find! The sushi is beautiful as well as yummy. The Groupon we used came with edamame, very large salads with ginger dressing and a delicious tempura, as well as a specialty roll. We chose tuna max and ordered a yummy roll. We couldn't believe how good everything was. It is my new favorite sushi place, even though it's a pretty far drive. By the way, try the all day pineapple saki. The best saki I've ever had,  bar none!"}
{"text":"Love the vibe, chill staff and awesome food for good prices. Gotta try it, at anytime. Also have a regular menu but the sushi is what clings me to the table."}
{"text":"The sushi was so-so. It didn't blow me away.  It wasn't horrible but unmemorable. The kids didn't like their meals either and they LOVE sushi house teriyaki chicken.   We'll keep looking for good sushi in this area."}
{"text":"Hmmm wow. So I came here on Valentine's Day with my husband. First, the happy hour prices are higher in the restaurant than they show on their website. 2nd, I had a quarter of my wine left and we had a lot of food on our table and when I went to take another sip I noticed it was gone. I said something to the server and her response was \"oh sorry.\" I had to tell the manager who brought me out another glass and apologized that's why giving this place a 3 instead of a 2. Third, didn't receive any wasabi or ginger with our sushi. Ordered 2 rolls and neither of them had it. Had to request it. Their hh says all day everyday vs the website that says it ends at 6. Probably be back if I'm in the neighborhood for their sushi. Had the tiger which was delish. The tofu was good but it's just a block of fried tofu."}
{"text":"I've read some of these reviews and have to laugh as people are expecting upscale cuisine. Call a spade a spade; Big Eye is one of the few affordable sushi happy hours left in Scottsdale.  I found this place when money was tight, and it gave me my sushi fix.  It is not the greatest I have ever experienced, yet it is my favorite as it took care of me when money was tight.  I do wish they would return to HH being 4:30-close on Saturdays, yet will always be grateful to this place.  If you want gourmet sushi, go pay for it elsewhere!  I am not paying for the server's presentation or fast service; I go here because I want sushi.  Big Eye has cornered an excellent market and is a hidden jewel."}
{"text":"Not bad.  Good sushi and decent service.  This was the second time we went to Big Eye.  The first time was just after they opened, and the service was horrible.  This time around, we thought we'd give them a second chance, and was happy to see that things have gotten better.  Overall, good sushi, good prices, and good service."}
{"text":"Great little gem! If you lie sushi you have to try this place. Red Dragon and the Chimichanga are awesome. Set was great too."}
{"text":"Food was very ftesh and delicious, we had the Yummy rolls, Cherry Blossom, avocado shrimp rolls and Miso soup. Ourserver was new but handled any questions and helped us with Groupon we had. I will definitely be back with family. Place is clean too!"}
{"text":"The food was super good. We have had a lot of sushi, and this is pretty good. Most of the rolls are slightly over priced, but the happy hour and lunch special rolls are a great deal. The shrimp on our surfer roll was cooked to perfection. The cream cheese they use isn't too heavy. The tempura was a good flavor. The fish wasn't stinky. We live near by and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"First off, I love sushi. Mostly all sushi, and I used to love this place but after my visit today- there is no way I would be back.   I came in at about 1:20, they close briefly from 2-4 everyday. There was one other couple, a server and no sushi chef anywhere. The first thing I noticed was this huge tub sitting out behind the sushi bar that had some kind of fish/meat in it. No refrigeration, nothing. Also, the refrigerated area with fish in it was a disaster, and the fish just looked nasty.   I figured it was just me so I ordered a beer and some gyoza. The gyoza came out burnt and slimy with some odd consistency I couldn't place. At that point the other couple left and it was just me sitting in there alone looking at this fish sitting out.  I had already ordered my sushi, a Las Vegas and spicy tuna roll so I waited. Finally a chef emerged and I asked what the fish was sitting out. He responded it was Salmon and then promptly put it out of sight. My sushi was disgusting. I mean WOAH gross. The spicy tuna had a weird gray color to it and tasted off. So I ate one, and decided to try the Vegas. The vegas was awful. It tasted like I was eating old hot tuna, hopefully not something that had been sitting out.   Regardless, I could only stomach the few bites I took, finished my beer and bailed.  I've been there in the past and this wasn't the case, but judging by my stomachs reaction to that food, I really won't be back.   Bleh. Super dirty and disappointing."}
{"text":"All I have to say if beef ramen is the BOMB!  everything is great here.  We had a guy server and he was very nice.  Will go back!"}
{"text":"Bought a groupon which included soup for two, two sodas, veggie tempura, edamame, and one specialty roll.  The tempura, soup, and matcha green tea were all delicious. We ordered an additional roll with the meal since it wasn't enough to for two people. The rolls on their menu are higher priced than I normally see so I expected a lot. I was not impressed.  The rice was over cooked on the sushi so it was pretty mushy. The crispy vegetables inside the rolls were large chunks which was odd. Flavors blended together so I don't really remember what we even ordered, otherwise I'd have told you already. For $14 and $16 rolls I expected the rice to be cooked properly at a minimum.  The tables were pretty sticky, couldn't tell if it was the coat of paint or what. Place was empty so I would assume the table was clean.  Server was super nice. Only compliments to the staff.  Was it worth the try? I'd check out Teharu up the street instead."}
{"text":"Took almost two hours for delivery, spent 70 bucks on barely any food so I'm surprised the money is  two $$ signs. Because we barely got shit. Didn't even come with a side of rice or soup or salad. Nothing. And the sushi we ordered? Never again. Tiny as hell pieces, that were soggy and my husband and I tried a bite, had too throw them away, it was obviously old. Wasted money, and time on shitty barely any food, slow ass service. Thanks, not doing this place again. I'll get my sushi from frys, the grocery store next time, they are better tasting, more fresh, and bigger better pieces."}
{"text":"Amzing food and great prices... what more can be said about sushi. Go, go now! Do it!"}
{"text":"Yohan is and always will be the master of the sauce.  So many innovative rolls and sashimi plates.  Some times it may take a little time to get your order but sushi doesn't come from a microwave.    The people here are more than friendly and the music is very cool.   If you want to enjoy your evening then you can't go wrong coming here. If you want to just cram down some sushi and move on (we all of days like that) then go to  a revolving sushi bar. This place is for fun."}
{"text":"We were seated right away at the sushi bar and had great service. The garlic edamame is amazing!!! A must try. We loved the kamikaze roll and the summer roll was pretty good too. The salmon sashimi was fantastic."}
{"text":"I used to love big eye.  I haven't been here I about 5 months and this time was a huge disappointment.  I have never been to a sushi restaurant with such poor service.   It took forever to get our food.  I'm talking about needing to flag down a waiter to get in an order and then waiting an hour for our food.  I looked around and of the 10 tables occupied only 1 had food.  What's up with that?  One chef and he was making take out orders while the customers in the restaurant waited.   Sorry big eye.  It's the big good bye."}
{"text":"The food wasn't very fresh, the rolls were tiny, and overall it wasn't a great experience. Definitely not worth the price, honestly reminded me of grocery store sushi quality."}
{"text":"The big eye was pretty spicy and the guy who served us was really attentive and helpful. It was a good experience for having had a groupon"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!! Such good sushi and fantastic service. Great happy hour all day every day"}
{"text":"They have happy hour everyday, all day. I ordered the Gyoza and sushi rolls from happy hour menu and everything was prepared and made fresh. I also had teriyaki chicken. It was delicious and the chicken was all white meat.  Jason was our server and he was very attentive. Great service. Thank you. This is going to be our regular place and it's close to home."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi! Didn't even know this place existed. I ordered a Los Vegas Roll, a Candy Cane roll,  and a Spicy Tuna roll.  Everything was excellent."}
{"text":"Went with some friends for dinner - ordered a couple appetizers, some maki and some nigiri.  The edamame was good - nicely salted.  Didn't try the other, so can't comment.  Nigiri was ok.  Fish portions were on the small side, and decent - nothing special. Front door was open and it got cold - made me want to get the check and get out of there!  Might be worth another try...when it's warmer."}
{"text":"Actually really good sushi! I purchased a restaurant.com gift certificate and thought \"what do I have to lose\"  I was very happy! Prices were not too bad but could be lower but food was excellent!  The food I didn't like was the miso soup. It tasted like it came from those powder packet mixes. Wait staff could improve. I'd go again!  Would be 5 star if wait staff and soup was better."}
{"text":"4-15 on A Sunday welcomed bye a filthy table and a funky smell.  An Asian man who I think is the owner cleaned our table and disappeared.  When asking the other unenthused worker who was babysitting a child if they were open he responded with an attitude your waiter will be back after 15 minutes of this nonsense we left.  For me filth and sushi don't work together.  A shame was there same time last Sunday and had good food with terrible service but the food was good.  Oh well writing this from Flo's they never suck."}
{"text":"The sushi is pretty good but what I go for is the spicy Ramen it's the best I've found"}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has bad reviews. We came early on a Saturday night. Not busy when we got here, but it started to fill up quickly. We used a Groupon, which was a great deal, but their happy hour is almost as good! And it's all day every day! (But not for takeout) Overall, good service, good service, good bargain. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"this was my 3rd time going here.  Really great rolls and the employees there are very attentive and nice!  This will definitely be a sushi spot I will frequent."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time with this one folks. We sat for 10 minutes before the server took our drink order. Drinks came out 10 minutes later. Then the server ignored us for another 25 minutes. Two beers in, 45 minutes later and no order. I had to flag down another server to let him know I don't have time for this. No apology. Horrible service...will never go back and make sure all my friends know about the experience. I won't be surprised if the doors close soon."}
{"text":"I have visited just about every sushi spot in town and this was possibly some of the wort sushi my wife and I have ever had. It tasted like grocery store quality sushi. The rice was literally still wet. After first walking in I couldn't help but notice the strong fish smell. I have driven by numerous times and seen their front door wide open! This seems unheard of at any restaurant let alone a sushi bar. The prices even at happy hour were just reasonable considering the poor quality. The sushi chefs who are usually kind and friendly elsewhere had zero personality. We live very close to Big Eye and always wondered why it seemed so empty inside, the mystery was solved tonight on my first and last visit to this establishment."}
{"text":"Aweful service.  Waiter forgot the iced tea my boyfriend ordered came back a second time asked if we wanted to order drinks and he told the waiter he had ordered an iced tea with no lemon the waiter said oh yes I'm sorry I forgot he came back and of course the Ice-T had a lemon on it I politely told the waiter he cannot have a lemon he put it on the table he went to go reach for the lemon to remove it when my boyfriend said I cannot have a lemon I'm allergic. We ordered miso soup and he brought out salads instead of the soup he took only one back left the other one at the table brought only one miso soup back we told him he could take the other salad we want another soup. All the sushi that we wanted we put a little check next to it after we got what he thought was our last roll he brought us our check we told him we ordered two more we put it on the sheet he came back and said oh yeah I'm sorry I didn't see them. He finally brought the other two out no one ever came out to apologize nothing was comped we paid for everything we will not be back because of this service"}
{"text":"This place is yummy. Absolutely get the jalapeno poppers if you head here (and don't mind spicy). The service is great and price is reasonable. A hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Can't beat happy hour all day every day! Excellent food, great presentation. The staff always makes us feel very welcomed; super friendly people!   We come here several times a month, and have been doing this for over a year."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if Big Eye is my go-to sushi joint because it's convenient or because it's great, but I'll take both. It's small, quiet and dark and never crowded. They have a sushi bar and a handful of tables and usually one sushi chef and one server. I must say that the chef and the server that were there when I started going were great, but the mix of servers I've had recently are not. I'm hoping to go in and see Jason again soon.   The food is really good. They have some great specialty rolls with unique combos, but not an overwhelming menu with crazy choices. A good amount are tempura, which I usually avoid, but there are enough options that aren't fried. Keep in mind that spicy MEANS spicy at Big Eye!  The preparation isn't fast and with the usually empty dining room, it's easy to be annoyed, but it's worth the wait...just enjoy the time to relax! Their happy hour menu is small, but when I'm feeling thrifty is enough to keep me satisfied. I think they recently began to offer happy hour all day every day.   I take lots of friends and out-of-town guests here and I'm always happy to showcase it as my favorite local sushi place!"}
{"text":"This place is conveniently located for me so I go every once in a while. I also order takeout. The sushi is fine, though nothing extra special. I don't often have a drink here, but the drinks are hit and miss. My favorite items are actually the hot offerings. The gyoza and calamari are very tasty and well prepared. The chicken yakitori is a favorite of my son's. My biggest gripe, and the reason for three stars instead of four, is the wait. Whether dining in or picking up takeout, the wait is entirely too long. I'm encouraged by seeing more than one sushi chef the last time I was there, and if service became consistently speedier, I would return more frequently."}
{"text":"Love going to this place. Always has interesting music playing, a hostess up front and greets you upon arrival and the sushi is incredible.   Their Happy Hour prices are super low and you can get loaded up with food and some drinks at a fair price.   I highly recommend getting the Yummi roll. The name holds true.   Tucked back off of Frank Lloyd Wright. I have eaten here several times and will continue to frequent them."}
{"text":"Best sushi ever! Really good service and amazing sushi. I really recommend black tiger roll and Hawaiian roll."}
{"text":"After reading the other bad reviews, I was hesitant to come here. We went Friday night and it was pretty empty. In fact there was one table being occupied by a young family. After a few minutes, one of their young kids started crying really loud. It turns out that they put a really hot sauce in the kids meal. The mom and dad were yelling at the manager who didn't seem all that concerned. Our Sushi was okay, The fish was fresh but the rice had a lot of vinegar. My wife thinks they added extra vinegar to older rice to keep it moist and stick together.  The prices were reasonable. They have Smartphone coupons on their website. It is $10 off a bill of $40 or more. I showed my server who seemed to chuckle and said she would check. She came back and said since we didn't have the print out they would only give $5 off. I reminded her that it was their \"Smartphone\" Coupon that has instructions to just show the coupon on your phone. She then took my phone and walked back to the kitchen to show the manager. I found that odd that the manager wouldn't come out to talk to us. I am not a big fan of seeing my phone walk away from me for any reason.  They honored the $10. The service was actually pretty good. Overall, it wasn't terrible but I am unlikely to go back. Too many other good sushi places."}
{"text":"Crap service from unattentive staff. We won't be back.  1. We were the only customers on arrival. 2. Brought us our seaweed salad then the entire staff had a 10 minute pow-wow outside. We didn't have any utensils so we couldn't eat. 3. Never brought us our appetizers. 4. Never re-filled my water once in the hour we were there. 5. Charged us for the appetizers they never brought us. 6. Had to chase someone down after we had been there an hour, so we could get our check. 7. They came to our table 5 times in the hour we were there - order, drinks delivery, salad delivery, sushi delivery, check. They never checked up on us."}
{"text":"I went to Big Eye sushi on a Saturday night. Very slow on a sat night, and only a few people at this place saw the coupon on the paper and thought this place is pretty new. Turns out it had been there for 3 years already. They actually have Happy Hour all day long, and I ordered only from the happy hour menu. The sushi turned out to be pretty good actually, ordered Spicy crab roll, Vegas roll, chicken yakitori, and calamari. Along with that redeemed the free tempura roll with the coupon. I think the place deserves a 3 star, food quality was up to par for the price ( yay for happy hour!),but service wasn't uhhhh really? The blond waitress only came to check on me twice through out dinner, and looked like only one sushi chef was working. The order came out a little too slow, I think that's what other customers complained about. They need to improve their service for sure. I would go back for the happy hour though, its a good deal."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in here last night after a long day of shopping and craving sushi. We don't live too far so we decided to try this place out. We immediately sat ourselves at the sushi bar and started off with two sake bombers, miso soup and a cucumber salad. We then ordered their \"Jalapeño Tail\" sashimi along with three of their speciality rolls, with our favorite being the \"Sunshine\" roll. Our server, Austin, was extremely attentive and polite. Our food was delivered prompt without sacrificing flavor."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious with unexpectedly good friendly service. The udon bowl was perfect and the softshell crab roll the best we've ever had."}
{"text":"The sushi is decent. The happy hour deals are all day which is cool. Ice cold beer! I recommend the spicy tuna roll. The service is slow at times. Go when you have atleast an hour to an hour. They charged my card twice. Not sure if it was the bank or them."}
{"text":"So the one star that I'm giving goes for the sushi which is really good when done correctly. I spent a lot of time in north Scottsdale working and I love sushi so this place seemed perfect. I have now given them four chances and been disappointed each time mostly with the customer service. I have found large chunks of plastic in my sushi roll and when I called to have my order refunded I talk to three separate managers and no one ever refunded my money. It honestly got to the point where I was just tired of calling so I took the loss. They have also double charged my card, and charged me regular price for beers during happy hour. Still the sushi is good so against my better judgment I went back tonight. I will give them the mistake was mine, I ordered a crunchy roll by mistake instead of a tootsie roll. I was willing to take the loss of 4$ difference in price and just switch them out. I understand it was my mistake. But again big eye sushi is only concerned with taking your money. I was told I would need to buy another roll even though I didn't want to keep both rolls. I understand that is their prerogative but I will no longer be patronizing this restaurant. I have worked in customer service for many years and I know that the savings of at most 12$ for the crunchy roll doesn't make sense at the loss of a repeat customer. Oh well good thing north Scottsdale has a lot of other sushi restaurants!"}
{"text":"A friend recommended Big Eye after stopping in for happy hour one day, so some friends and I decided to give it a try as well.   It was definitely a drive from the Cen Pho, but I enjoyed it and will definitely go back again!   Their all day happy hour menu is wonderful and the prices here are pretty great.   You can try a good variety of sushi and not kill your bank account in the process.  We had the Calamari as an appetizer - it wasn't what I expected.  I expected a big pile of greasy fried calamari rings, which is what most restaurants serve.  Not here!  We got a plate of maybe 8 long strips of calamari that was very lightly fried to the perfect texture and taste.  It was so good!   For sushi, we ordered:  Tootsie Roll  Spicy Tuna  Tunamax Las Vegas  I rate sushi places by their spicy tuna and this one definitely gets 4 stars - I really enjoyed it, it had the perfect amount of subtle heat to it, tasty tuna, and was overall really good.   The tunamax was also really good, this was my favorite roll we tried!    The tootsie roll is a favorite usually, as I love eel.  It was decent, but not the most flavorful.  Will probably try something different next time.   The Las Vegas roll was a hit at our table.  We ordered 2 orders of this one for 4 people and it was the first one totally gone.  Warm, cream cheese,  salmon, avocado... mmm!  I don't usually like tempura fried rolls but this one definitely melts in your mouth (although it's a huge roll, so you'll first have to figure out how to get it in your mouth! haha).   We also had the house sake, which was a little strong for me but mixed with some Kirin Light it definitely hit the spot.  I love the wide selection of sushi on the menu.   I look forward to going back and trying more soon!  Glad to have found this place.   Go check it out and post your favorite rolls too!"}
{"text":"Got some extra time on your hands? An agonizing, pulling teeth, experience. Someone fire the slow sushi chef, absolutely ridiculous! Good sushi if ya got the extra time and don't give a s#it about service."}
{"text":"Great Happy hour between 4:30-6:30pm.  Spacious new restaurant in North Scottsdale.  Come if you want a nice quiet atmosphere and great food.  Sushi was authentic and tasty.  The Yelp deals for it are a great buy AND can be used during Happy Hour!"}
{"text":"This is the best sushi place in Scottsdale. The sushi is always fresh and delicious, and the service is excellent. In its early days, they had a problem with service (speed and order accuracy), but they haven't had that problem in years. I bring all of my sushi - loving friends here, and they love it."}
{"text":"The Jalapeño poppers are amazing here. The caterpillar rolls also are great.  Austin was our waiter and he was super friendly.  Would never have found this place if not for groupon.  It's behind chase bank."}
{"text":"We live right around the corner loved this place for a long time. But the owner is to good to be in front and work the business. Has so way to many turn over of staff never had the same sushi chef. He just doesn't know how to run a Resturant. Be in front of your customer give them service, don't hind out in the back of the restaurant. It builds business!!"}
{"text":"Great service. Food was delicious throughout. We enjoyed the free appetizer they gave us for checking in on yelp. Highly recommend the black tiger role. I have the vegetable tempura was done really nicely. Not heavy on the batter. Great spot! Thanks!!"}
{"text":"First time here and so far not impressed. Someone seriously dropped the ball today. We bought a groupon for an unlimited sushi showdown and paid $30 per person. It took 45 minutes to get water at our table. 1.5 hours to get round one which consisted of a small piece of sashimi tuna and salmon.  Now 2 hours in and we are still waiting for round two. So far I would say we have maybe been served $10 worth of food and we only have another 30 minutes until the event is over.  They are under staffed and not at all prepared.  The worst part is not being able to get a refund. So it looks like we will be leaving hungry and feeling taken advantage of. Below are pictures describing the event, implying that there would be multiple sushi chefs along with enough food to at least fill you up. When in reality it's two chefs making 2 basic sashimi dishes and only two servers trying to accommodate $50+ people. This could have been a great way to promote their restaurant and instead there are 50 people that for sure will not be coming back or recommending this place."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times now and can't say that much about it. The sushi is good, but not the best. The service has not been up to par lately and I can't say that I have been happy with my sushi going experience every when I walk out. There are cheaper sushi places in the area with better quality sushi and better quality service. If you're looking for mediocre this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"When you are really sick and your mother shows up at your door with a Tuna Tower from Big Eye Sushi ,all your sicko feelings go away (even if only for a little bit!) Johan and crew- your the best. thank you again and again! Trying to get a date for the sushi showdown! Beth"}
{"text":"I went in last night (Sunday) and there were 3 people in the restaurant.  The guy at the front said it would be 30-40 minutes for food.  Not a very good first impression.  Needless to say, I have no food to review but me being the king of second and third chances I'll try again another time."}
{"text":"We tried for the first time as it was fairly close to our house.  We have had sushi all over Scotsdale the last 5 years and this was the worst experience for a first time family to endure.  The waitress and manager tried to be attentive, but did not get close to satisfying us.  I had to get up and get wasabi dishes and soy sauce and had to go to the counter to get extra wasabi.  We never received plates to eat from.  The sushi was blah and blaher.  No taste, small portions and fish that you needed a magnifying glass to see.  And it was well overpriced at that.  Worst part was we had to watch most of the restaurant complain and send back food constantly.  So a bad night all around - I would not recommend trying and we definitely will not give a second look."}
{"text":"Bought a groupon for this place because of the high stars. I was super disappointed. The service itself was lacking, it took around 10 minutes just to get the soup. Then everything we ordered came out one at a time. My 5 year olds being last which was just noodles. It took longer for the food to be brought out than it did for us to eat. We ordered calamari and it was so over cooked it was inedible. The soup, veggies, and edamame were average. We got the King Kong roll and it not great, one piece of the fish was cooked through and on the other end was raw. The avocado was brown and mushy as well.  My sons noodles were over done as well, he wouldn't touch them. Wouldn't recommend and wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Meh.  I've never been unimpressed by sushi & I must say, I was unimpressed.  The space is nice. I had a choice to watch Game 7 or Avatar between the two TVs which I thought was humorous. Service was good; a little awkward, but good.  The seaweed salad was a disappointment. There was barely any seaweed & just a lot of greens. The gyozas were soggy & didn't have much flavor.  The tootsie roll was falling apart but did taste good.   Saved $7 by buying the Yelp deal - prices were reasonable even without it though. All around, meh."}
{"text":"Hidden Gem... Stopped here after years of driving by and wow so happy we did!! The spicy salmon sushi as well as the summer crab roll were amazing! At first it was two of us but within 30 mins the place was filled with people so come early to get your favorite seat. Matt recommended the BBQ beef skillet and let me tell that will be a regular dish with every visit. The service was top notch already planning our next visit!"}
{"text":"Great lunch specials! Sushi combo A. 10 bucks for 2 rolls, shrimp tempura, plus soup. Plus it's right next to 24 hour fitness so I can lift and get a sushi fix in the same visit!  David makes the best rolls! Sammi is the best server!"}
{"text":"Based on other reviews, I think they must be under new mgmt because it seems Big Eye used to be a LOT better.  We've been a handful of times in the last few years, and it's always about the same: decent food, high prices.  The tables are usually dirty-looking (not sure if their finish is just trashed after so long or if they're genuinely dirty) and they're NEVER busy.  Why the food should take so long to come out is beyond me.  Came in on a night where Zipp's across the parking lot had a waiting list a mile long; Big Eye had only 3 tables!  Not even 'overflow' from those unwilling to wait for Zipp's.  Not a good sign.  Our server couldn't have been nicer and tried to 'excuse' the long wait by saying because it was a 'deal' we used, the sushi roll takes longer (what??)  Fact is they had one chef for the entire restaurant and maybe everyone ordered at the same time. Who knows.  I'm surprised they're still open after so long since they're never busy. Might be why they keep running deals and have an all day HH. Another annoyance is being closed between 2-4 daily. I am done working at 1 or 2 daily depending on daylight savings time, so I'm starving for a 'lunner' around those times; def. not conducive to some peoples' work schedules, like mine.  I hope they improve soon and can compete w/the other sushi place just a couple miles away. The food was really good, so if they can get a good staff, they'll be fine. :)"}
{"text":"Yup, it's my 4th time having sushi in 4 days.  This time I took my son who is 4 and has already developed a taste for sushi just like his mama.  We ordered the tuna, salmon, and yellowtail sashimi (6 pieces/ $10 each) and an order of chicken teriyaki ($12)  The sashimi came first and to my surprise, there were 10-12 pieces for each kind of sashimi!  We were delighted of course and still fought over the number of delicious slices of fish each one of us ate!  Then the chicken teriyaki came and to my surprise, it was a lean cut of chicken breast with very little sauce (which was just perfect for my low/ no carb diet!) with a big bowl of rice which was perfect for my son!  My son said, \"Thanks mommy for taking me out to this supper dinner!\" which sums up our meal.  Why not 5 stars, there was just one waitress for the whole restaurant and while she was very friendly, service was slow which can be hard for this mama with a hungry 4 year old in tow!"}
{"text":"Omg!!! From the sushi to service... 5 stars well deserved!! Sushi was so fresh and happy hour was a win win!! It was so hard to choose from the selection but our server was so patient and friendly. She recommended a few specialty rolls and we couldn't decide which were our favorite. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu! Did I mention happy hour! ;)"}
{"text":"What a major disappointment. Our server, Austin was new...nice kids, knows nothing about sushi. Managed to screw up the entire order.  The server who was training him was barely any better. We were very clear about flying fish egg with quail on top.  They were out of quail but still brought the order. It's like ordering a cheeseburger and getting no cheese.  Would it have been so difficult to ask us if we still wanted the order as they had no quail egg? And the hits kept rolling.  My salmon skin hand roll can out as a sliced roll?   Not even close to a salmon skin hand roll.   I feel terrible as I was hoping they would make it but I cannot possibly go back. The guy that was supposed to be training the server was not on the floor....he stopped by for a second but didn't help in any way.  The sushi chef was overwhelmed, although the entire restaurant was empty when we placed our order! If there is an owner out there I suggest you get your butt in your restaurant and stay there.  You have incompetent people that do not care about your business.  Every time someone has a bad experience it is a ripple that will kill your business . The excuses for the slow service combined with the wrong orders were inexcusable. Not worth mentioning.  They couldn't even get the request for extra wasabi right.  I mean PATHETIC"}
{"text":"I tried this place with my mother for the first time about a month ago. The food was great. I ate way more than normal, I just couldn't help myself.   My favorite rolls are, the tootsie, cherry blossom, sunshine, and Las vegas. Our server was Jason and he was very attentive as was the sushi chef Yohan. We will defiantly be back again."}
{"text":"My to go place when I crave Sushi. Small yet very good sushi, personal service and very fairly priced."}
{"text":"By far the most pleasant service I've had!!! The smile on the waitress's face was contagious! The happiness with which she served, made us enjoy our meal even more!!!  Being vegetarian, we ordered a portion of the Veggie Tempura and two portions of Vegetable Sushi Rolls. Everything was made really well, and affordable! Just $7 a plate! I especially liked the combination of carrots, broccoli and the crisp tempura incorporated into the Sushi. Great ambience too! Loved the comfy red couches! Definitely recommend this place to enjoy a nice Sushi meal!"}
{"text":"We've been here multiple times - probably 6 or more.  The best thing on the menu is the jalepeno \"poppers.\" Try them!  To the reviewers that say that this place is awful and the reviewers haven't had real sushi, I have to disagree. I've been to many amazing sushi restaurants around the country and abroad over the past 15 years, and I still give this restaurant 4 stars. Is this the most amazing sushi you'll ever have? No, of course not. Is it the best you'll get for $3-$9 a roll with an incredibly friendly staff? Yep.   Also, they usually have a Yelp repeat customer check in special - was a free edamame appetizer for every 2 Yelp check ins, last time I went was a free ice cream dessert."}
{"text":"Definitely not the typical Scottsdale sushi joint, but one of my favorites. Whenever I go in it's a little slow and quiet which doesn't bother me but doesn't seem good for business. They have a great all day happy hour menu that offers some incredible specials. I recommend the Vegas roll as it is one of my favorites in the valley"}
{"text":"Went here with a Groupon which includes edamame, soup or salad, tempera, one speciality roll and 2 soft drinks.  Nice atmosphere and staff.  We sat at the sushi counter.  We decided on the Black Tiger roll with spicy tuna, shrimp, salmon, eel and avocado.  The edamame came out hot and salted.  To me it would have been better unsalted but that is personal taste.  The salad was fresh with a delightful dressing.  The tempura was fried perfectly offering mushroom, yam, broccoli, onions and string beans.  The roll was delicious and pleasing to the eye.  All ingredients were fresh and melted in your mouth the way sushi should.  Great deal for the money.  Plenty of parking in the strip mall.  TVs were playing with the sound muted.  You could have a nice conversation.  We will return."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed in the terribly unorganized event held today for a \"sushi showdown\" and advertised \"unlimited sushi\".  There was absolutely not unlimited sushi. My friend and I purchased a Groupon for this event for $30 each expecting to get more food then we could handle at a fun event. The restaurant only had TWO servers for the entire place and event was held from 1-3:30 which meant everyone was eating at the same time. Basic things like water and silverware were missing from tables and we didn't even get one of the rounds which we had to ask for. We sat and waited the whole time hoping for good. Shit show. Literally. Everyone in the entire place was mad because it took so long and we didn't even get the last of (only!) three rounds of Four pieces of sushi because we had already been there over 2.5 hours!! This event was a joke. They need to organize and prep in advance if they want to keep any customers at all. Complete waste of money and I'm still hungry. The only reason I am giving it two stars instead of one is because the tiny amount of sushi that we did eat was good....but not worth the absolutely unacceptable service and false advertisement."}
{"text":"First time here! Jason (the manager) was attentive, informative, and answered all questions even though they were fairly busy. He also made sure to check on us and our food. This place was extremely clean and the sushi was very fresh. I will be coming back here again without a doubt!! Thanks again Jason!"}
{"text":"I'm beyond happy with this place. Jason our server was on it! Always had refills and even allowed us to make modifications to our rolls. The food was delicious I got the Dragon roll, the Rainbow, and the Yummy. The yummy came with a spicy chipotle sauce and they allowed me to order it with out. The seaweed salad was yummy as well. The atmosphere was nice a great place to hang out with friends or go on date! I'm definitely going back. Loved this place"}
{"text":"I so love this place! The sushi chefs are so talented and the food is presented so beautifully. The ramen is addicting, the sashimi and sushi is always fresh and tasty, and the staff is super sweet and accommodating. I usually eat there but they do my to go orders perfectly. Keep up the great work! highly recommended the tuna Max &  tuna tower to everyone."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times and have thoroughly enjoyed every meal. The food is fresh and service has been great.  They have take out, too.  Prices are reasonable and they serve drinks. They have a great all day happy hour."}
{"text":"The service was terrible.  They charged us for a 3 rolls more than we even got and the server got mad at us when we were there. The fish is not worth the money and the service is definitely not."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I live in the area and we have been to many different sushi restaurants on the west coast and in Phoenix; Big Eye is our little hidden gem, usually dine weekdays around 7:00 pm. One or two other groups are usually in the restaurant when we are there, so it's pretty nice that it isn't crowded when we are there. (Plus it's happy hour all day!!!) Sushi is great, staff is very friendly and polite. I would definitely recommend and will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Avoid! Incompetent service! Like they are on drugs? Food was fine when they finally got it to us. The experience was surreal. If you want to nominate for a reality show this place would be it. Not sure how they are in business. Hmmm did I say don't go near this place?"}
{"text":"Since Big Eye opened, I have struggled to  find fresher fish. Alliteration aside, the goods here are top notch and you'd be hard pressed to find better deals elsewhere. Yes, I'm here quite a bit, which is why I am supremely confident in my upcoming recommendation. . . Make Big Eye a regular stop in the ever-growing, ever-competitive sushi gauntlet that is North Scottsdale. I love the atmosphere, the sushi, the beer, and the wonderful staff. Ask  Sushi Chef John for a \"Carter Roll,\" and maybe my incoherent yammering, and incessant nagging will drown out as your taste buds make all the noise."}
{"text":"Quiet atmosphere, good sushi with Happy Hour all day - everyday."}
{"text":"very disappointed! I eat a lot of sushi, I generally eat out 4 times a week. food was mediocre at best. expensive rolls, tiny portions, ridiculous. fish didn't taste fresh  one star for the salad.  but to top it off, the place feels more like a cheap bar, there was only one other small table and the service was absolute crap. not sure why they seemed to hire a skater dude instead of a proper, attentive waiter.  wouldn't come back even if the meal was free  lousy"}
{"text":"Probably the best sushi I've had in a long time while living in Arizona. Highly recommended. Fresh, decent prices and a huge selection. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Maybe the sushi is good, but I kind of doubt it based on the quality of the yakisoba. Also, I watched the chef cutting a large portion of salmon and his slices were awkward and clumsy. I wouldn't recommend this overpriced filth to my worst enemy. STAY AWAY!"}
{"text":"I love this place! My fiancé  and I live walking distance so you can catch us here once a week. It's very affordable sushi. I love sushi and this is our spot. Every time we want sushi this is the place we go. Try the baked scallop roll and the yummy roll. They are both on the happy hour menu and they are yummy rolls! My fiancé also really likes the soups and the jalapeño poppers (I always get sushi). The services is also great too. The staff is so friendly!!!! I love this place!!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been wanting to try this place for a while and recently went on a weekday. When we arrived around 1:15pm, there were only two customers sitting at the sushi bar and a sushi chef creating rolls. He indicated we could sit wherever we wanted and we choose a booth near the back. We sat around for a while and no one came to take our orders. Looking around, I noticed the hostess stand up front had some menus, so I grabbed two and went back to sit down. After viewing the menu and deciding on what we wanted, a waiter finally came over and took our orders. I ordered the udon bowl and my husband order the ramen bowl. We also ordered an appetizer of pork dumplings (goyza).   The appetizer arrived first and was really tasty. The pork was tender and juicy. The dipping sauce was tart and lemony. Overall, it was really good and we'd definitely order the goyza again. (Plus it was a steal at $3 an order.) Next, our California sushi rolls arrived. (Rolls were included with both our meals.) The rolls weren't anything special but they were tasty and filling. Finally, our bowls arrived. My husband really enjoyed his ramen. It had beef and mushrooms and was pretty spicy. My udon bowl came with tempura sides (onion rings, sweet potato, and shrimp). The udon itself was tender and the broth was tasty. I only wish there had been more items in the actual bowl itself (other than just noodles and broth) but it was tasty nonetheless.  The only downside to this experience was that in the beginning the service was lacking when we first arrived, but once our waiter introduced himself, he was extremely attentive and refilled my water numerous times without prompting. Overall, the food was really tasty and we will definitely be back. Happy Hour runs all day and this includes special appetizers, sushi, and drinks. They had numerous rolls that sounded delicious and I can't wait to try them all."}
{"text":"This place restored my faith in sushi and humanity!  Prior to coming to Big Eye, I'd been experiencing a lot of mediocre sushi... that all changed the moment I tasted the crunchy spicy tuna roll.   The tuna was perfection, the roll wasn't weighed down with too much rice, and the avocado was a nice little surprise for the tastebuds.   As for restoring my faith in humanity, everyone working here is super friendly and accommodating.  I do have a teeny tiny problem with this place. I have been craving the crunchy spicy tuna roll every day since I've been there... but I LIVE IN TUCSON. And there's no Big Eye here.  So thanks for that.  At least I know where my first stop will be next time I'm in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere fantastically delicious tuna and salmon and happy hour all day long what could be better than that"}
{"text":"Since I had a coupon from Restaurant .com, my wife and I decided to try this place. It's a bit far from where we live, but we don't mind driving.   When we walked in, there were plenty of tables to sit at. All the customers were at the sushi bar for happy hour. The music was a variety of songs from Izzy Kamakawiwo'ole to some oldies.  I started off with Edamame. The prices for the Seaweed salad is about twice what I would pay at any other Japanese restaurant. I ordered a Tobiko which is Nigiri sushi with flying fish roe, they  didn't have it. For dinner I had the Chirashi and my wife ordered two sushi rolls; Crunchy and Spicy Tuna.  My Chirashi was OK, but I missed having the shredded radish, sliced cucumber and fresh tamago (egg), theirs was small and chewy. Most of the fish was fresh except for the ahi tuna which looked like it was previously frozen. The sushi rice was fresh and my wife enjoyed the sushi rolls.  They were a little slow at getting our orders to us. Mine came first and had to wait about 10-15 minutes before the sushi rolls came out. The green tea was hot, but looked like it had been sitting in the pot for some time.  The server, Jason was polite and willing to go the extra mile. He could only go as fast as the slowest sushi chef."}
{"text":"Went here many months ago and had a terrible experience.  Very few people in the place on a mid-week evening and yet it took forever to get our food.  Sushi came out item by item instead of all together so people had to wait until their order came while others were eating.  Food was OK but service was horrible.  Thought I'd give it a second chance tonight but they are nothing if not consistent.  Took 45 minutes for first of three rolls to come out.  Then  10 minutes between #2 and #3.  Meanwhile my guest ordered salmon and that was finished before my first roll appeared.  When I let it be known that I was not pleased the waitress actually tried to convince me that we waited too long to decide and because there was only one sushi chef other tables got their orders in before ours.  Wait, it was my fault?  I don't think so.  Two strikes and your out.  Every place deserves a second chance but not a third so this place is scratched from my list of places to go for dinner."}
{"text":"I decided to check out Big Eye about a week ago and I could not have been more pleased with the quality of food & hospitality. After reading the mixed reviews on here, I felt compelled to write about my experience here.   For starters, the service was top notch and made a memorable impression. The waiter was attentive and consistent in making sure we had everything necessary to thoroughly enjoy our meal. Mission accomplished.   Next, the Sushi chef(s) were prompt in the preparation of the delicious rolls we ordered. (I'm not sure why other customers on here were complaining about the prep time. Personally, I would think that if someone were spending slightly more time and attention to what was being created for me, I would find that to be quite a positive attribute. Sounds like you belong to the Instant-Gratification Nation. If you are looking for a lightning-fast meal, I'd highly suggest Burger King or something of that nature.   Finally, the food. The reason why I left with a satisfied stomach. The rolls were absolutely on point and extremely delicious. I'd recommend you try anything they offer in the spicy category or something that involves tuna/salmon.  The Happy Hour: Tasty rolls & half price drinks. To the point and hits the spot.  Lastly, on my way out I met the sushi chef/owner named Yohan and he was the nicest, most down-to-earth person I've met in quite some time. He suggested I come back on Saturday night for the \"After Hours Party\"  that starts at 10:30 and includes FREE appetizer rolls and Happy Hour drink price along with a live DJ spinning the tunes to enliven the mood. (Yes, people. Free food). Don't know too many other sushi joints that offer that. Count me in.   I will be back. The End."}
{"text":"The theme seems to be consistent....I wish I checked the reviews before trying this place.    The restaurant was empty when we first came in. The server was very friendly but not very attentive. My sushi took almost 2 hours to prepare and the server made it sound as if it was my fault for ordering it a certain way (soy paper and brown rice) okay fine but it was an option on the menu and I didn't have any idea it would take that long.   Our waters we're rarely refilled and the specialty cocktails were just ok.   To make up for the inconvenience of waiting, the server took items off of our friends bill, BUT I was the one who waited for 2 hours to eat, way after my friends were finished with their meals.   The total bill was extremely overpriced, and portions pretty small. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Amazing food at great prices. We drive 30 minutes to get here its just that good. All the staff is very friendly. They have happy hour everyday  all day long."}
{"text":"Every roll I have had here after multiple visits has been fresh and high quality.  Our service has always been great.  It is not cheap, but always well worth it."}
{"text":"I can't believe I have never been here before. Incredible. The fish is fresh and the staff is awesome. This should be the absolute apot for anyone looking for a new sushi joint. Thumbs and toes up!!!"}
{"text":"Seriously, the best sushi in town. The sunshine roll is so fresh and delicious. A server said \"this is the kind of roll that makes your tastbuds happy\". He was sooo right.  The hamachi tail is my second favorite. And  the service is top notch too. Everyone is nice.  We've been here many times.  This place never let's you down."}
{"text":"Great restaurant, super friendly staff. Fast service and most importantly tasty sushi. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Moving from the west to North Scottsdale, I knew I had to find a sushi restaurant close to my apartment, since I eat sushi AT LEAST twice a week.  The closest one to me was Big Eye and I couldn't have hoped for anything better! Literally 3 minutes away from my house, great service and fantastic fresh fish.    Now having been a regular for 2 years, I love every time I go in there, everyone makes me feel like family.  The servers, including the sushi chefs are always very attentive and talkative.  The servers always remember my drink order (order a shot of Party Girl!), which having been in the restaurant business this is something I very much appreciate.  As far as the sushi, I am so glad I found a place that not only has good rolls, but fresh fish. I have ordered tuna, salmon and yellowtail sashimi and it has all been delicious.  For the rolls, the sunshine and the King Kong roll are definitely my favorite!! ( I always put cream cheese in in the sunshine roll, because lets face it, cream cheese makes everything better.) They are always very accommodating if you ask to omit or add stuff to the roll, which I love, because I can get a little snobby about sauces.   The other AMAZING thing about Big Eye, is happy hour all day every day! Getting off work at happy hour time, I am always looking for good happy hour places to get good price drinks and appetizers.  So no matter what time I go into Big Eye, I know I can get happy hour prices! They have sake, red and white wine, potstickers, jalapeño poppers, and to make it even better, a TON of rolls as well! A lot of places that have happy hour rolls, are a smaller version; at Big Eye, its the full size roll :)   So if you are looking for a good happy hour place, fresh fish, friendly staff and a great date place, give Big Eye a try! Me and all my girlfriends love it!!"}
{"text":"Let me start by stating that we have been regulars at Big Eye since we moved to Scottsdale 6 years ago. The last 3 times we have been in the service has been lacking but we figured what the heck, the food is great! Well tonight was the last straw... During our 2 hour visit to Big Eye tonight we watched a lady and her kids walk out when they were not even greeted after 15 mins, it took 45 minutes for us to get place settings and our order was messed up twice by the server. The worst part was that we did not even get an apology! I would just like to say... Big Eye shame on you for only having 1 server to deal with all of those people on a Wednesday night alone & server when you mess up someone's order apologize and make sure that the remainder of the order is correct! Sorry to say but this local will be having Japanese food at some other sushi spot from now on!"}
{"text":"I ate here tonight.  It was good.  I have been here 2 times now.  I went a few years ago during their 1st week in business.  Needless to say it is much better now.  The happy hour menu is very good, and everybody that worked there was friendly and the service was also very good.  I have nothing bad to say."}
{"text":"Had a very nice experience at Big Eye the other evening. We used the Groupon and had absolutely no trouble. We had the salad and miso soup, tempura vegetables, edamame, and the tiger roll. Everything was very tasty and the service was good. If I had a complaint, I would say the tuna in the roll was a little warm and the salmon on top was maybe not the best quality sashimi. But it still tasted good. I would return."}
{"text":"Great sushi spot in North Scottsdale. Came with a buddy. We sat at the sushi bar. The staff was very friendly and the sushi chef was great. We tried a bunch of rolls and some sashimi entirely based on the recomendations of the sushi chef. With some nigori sake, it was a great dinner. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Service was great, but the food was terrible. This is one of those places that can make you never like sushi again. YUCK! Stay away!"}
{"text":"Found this place while we were in town for the weekend! We had a craving for sake & sushi and this place was close by so we gave it a try. We were both glad we did!   Yohan was our sushi chef and recommended a couple rolls. We got the Cherry Blossom, Las Vegas and Baked Scallop rolls and baked green mussels. All of it looked amazing and tasted even better!   They have happy hour all day so sake bombs were only $7!! The food was delicious and we had an awesome time!   Wish we could take Big Eye Sushi back to LA with us!!!"}
{"text":"This is such a wonderful place! The atmosphere, the people, and the sushi (especially the yellowtail) was superb! Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Took the kids here tonight without the husband who said he wouldn't come here because of all the bad Yelp reviews. Willing to give it a try, we sat down and ordered some sushi. They have some specials for happy hour (4:30-6:30pm M -Sat) so we got a roll, some yellowtail nigiri, and an order of chicken katsu. The food was good, the yellowtail was fresh, the Vegas roll was tasty, and the kids loved the chicken katsu. I have to agree with the reviews about service however. We were there early, the place was almost empty at the time yet the waitress was rather slow and uninterested, and never came over to ask how we were doing with our meals. I definitely deduct a star for the (lack of) service. I would go back however, it was reasonably priced, and the food was tasty. Just get better at service and I'll give them another star!"}
{"text":"Great as always . Good service . Las Vegas great! Tootsie ... cucumber salad.. cute interior .. prices reasonable."}
{"text":"I went To Big Eye Sushi because my friend had a coupon from restaurant.com.  we sat at the sushi bar and there was only one other table in the place. I ordered my usual,  Yellow tail, mackerel, and salmon roe.   The mackerel was grey and tasted like tuna fish out of the can, like it was cooked. I told the chef behind the counter and he told me it was cured. I was like;  Are you Serious? we had the calamari appetizer and it was like rubber bands. not fresh.  I'm not a fan of Big eye sushi and wouldn't return. And by the looks of the sparce cuts of fish in the fridge in front of us and the few patrons that came in I don't think they will be there long. Sushi is a tough business in Phx for obvious reasons and food cost is enormous.  I give this place 2 sushi knives out of 5.  We had a $50 coupon had two big beers each and two sake's and tried about 7 dishes. The total after coupon was $130.      There are just too many better value and better quality sushi places to go back to one that is marginal.   Service was ok ... nothing notable."}
{"text":"Big Eye has an excellent new age vibe to it. It's a great place to come to enjoy you're favorite sports teams play while also enjoying happy hour all day, every day. The people there are excellent and very friendly :). And if an Asahi or Kirin is not you're glass of beer then you're in luck because, Big Eye has a diverse selection of alcohols. Oh and Sushi orders come out in the order they come in."}
{"text":"I decided to eat at Big Eye Sushi today and decided to try some new items that I've not eaten.  The waiter immediately sat us down at the bar by choice. Immediately got the waters and our selected drinks.   The selected rolls we wanted to try was the volcano, Black tiger, surfer w/ a twist, and chimichanga w/ a twist.   I would have to say the food was delicious, beyond delicious because it was tasty, fulfilling, and makes me want to order more food.   I give this a 5 star.   I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love love this little hidden gem. Anything you order always fresh and delicious. They are very friendly and accommodating too."}
{"text":"The food is always great, and I'm picky about my food, everyone is always nice, and when I came the last time for take out they gave me water while I waited! Very cool!"}
{"text":"The dolsot bibimbop is magnificent.  And the crunchy spicy tuna roll is the best I've had anywhere."}
{"text":"Great place to go grab a couple beers and some good sushi!  We sat at the bar and the sushi chef made us a special roll that wasn't on the menu!  The sushi rice is good. Fish was fresh. Staff was very friendly. This is my spot when i'm in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Good food and good vibe their happy hour is a bargain and the drinks are a good price.The yummy roll is a must try if you're a first timer there and the chicken yakatori is graciously flavored."}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times and usually it is Grand - inviting hostess, friendly & informative staff, yummy food, etc... but the last time I went there were only two servers working that night and right as the server/hostess was seating us another table broke a glass so she just dropped the menus on the side of the sushi bar and said she would be right back.  Granted, a broken glass does require immediate attention and could take a few minutes to clean up but then the server forgot to come back to us for about 10 minutes.... We ended up asking the sushi chef for a pencil to mark what we wanted and flagged down the waitress to take our order, which we had to bring up that we wanted something to drink and two miso soups. She brought the waters and then she announced \"here is ONE of your miso soups\". The other soup eventually came out after our first sushi order did.   We had to stop the waitress for some chopsticks then realized we didn't have napkins so called for her again and then realized we didn't have any plate or sauce dishes so we called for her again, and then realized we didn't have any soy sauce and called for her yet again...at this point I felt like we were bothering her and did not dare ask to get a refill on our drinks.    It was just very odd because the waitress acted as though they were super busy only having two waitresses but there were only three other tables seated while we were there.   The good thing is that they have HAPPY HOUR (ALL DAY, EVERY DAY) unfortunately, we did not know this since they still keep their happy hour menus with specific times at the table... whaaa whaaa  The food is good (I recommend the surfer roll) and the chefs are cool to talk to."}
{"text":"For background, I majored in Japanese Studies in college and have spent extended periods in Japan over many years.  My family and I moved to Scottsdale last summer, and have been eager to find our favorite Japanese restaurant in the Valley.  We've driven past Big Eye Sushi many times, but had never ventured in.    A few months ago I tried some of their sushi at a potluck event, and I was pleasantly surprised by the taste and quality.Then I saw a Groupon half-price offer and figured it was worth a gamble.    We went on a Tuesday night, arriving at 6:15.  There were a few people installed at the sushi bar and a few more tables were occupied.  As others have written, there was one sushi chef, one waitress, and at least one other in the kitchen.  We found the server pleasant and efficient and didn't feel that any wait was unusually long.  We did ask them to turn the pop music (which we liked) down since the bass was pounding pretty hard, and they did so without any hesitation.  The sushi menu is extensive, the non-sushi menu is short.  We ordered a Chicken Katsu, a Beef Teriyaki, some California Rolls, a Crispi (sic) Roll, Cucumber Roll, Tuna Roll, and a special request: crab roll.    The entrees were fresh and non-greasy.  The sushi was also very fresh, light and delicious.  I was impressed with the Crispi Roll that the tempura shrimp and crunchies on top were also light and non-greasy, and that neither the spicy crab nor the eel sauce overwhelmed any of the other flavors in the roll.    In sum, I would definitely return to Big Eye Sushi.  So far, it's my favorite sushi in the Valley, and as a bonus it's the closest sushi to my house.  If I were to change something it would be to enlarge the non-sushi part of the menu, but it's hard to argue with keeping it small and doing it right."}
{"text":"Our go to sushi place since moving to the valley. Love it!! Everything we've tried has been fantastic! Happy hour all day long..."}
{"text":"This is my favorite local sushi bar in Scottsdale. I always feel welcomed by the staff and they are always very nice, social, and prices are not high. I recommend this place to anyone who enjoys good sushi."}
{"text":"Surfer roll is awesome!!! I highly recommend! Awesome service too :) great happy hour!"}
{"text":"The sushi rolls are miniature. Sashimi paper thin. My wife and I were terribly disappointed. Just go to a place like Shogun (its been there for 25 years) and compare. The sushi chef has no personality which is why this place has no atmosphere.  What a waste of money.  After spending $50 we decided getting more sushi at this place was not worthwhile.  We went to AJs and got fresh fruit to fill up on the way home and laughed.  There are way too many great sushi restaurants in Scottsdale AZ to waste your time here."}
{"text":"Top notch fish, preparation, and service.  Delightful experience."}
{"text":"Lunch Review: I really wanted to like this place since it's near my office and home :(  However, I just can't bring myself to give it more than 2 stars.  My coworker and I walked in at 11:38 as the only customers in the whole place.  Apparently they just opened their doors for the day (?) As I sat down I observed that NOTHING was behind the sushi bar.  No sushi chef.....and no sushi supplies.  Interesting.  The host was very kind and ended up also being our server.  We ordered edamame and it came out promptly after we placed our rolls order.  We ordered 2 specialty rolls and a plain tuna roll.  By this time 2 other parties had filled the restaurant.  About 15 minutes passed and one party received a large order (it looked tasty!) of tempura stuff.  We found it interesting that they were served before us though they came in after us.  Exactly 28 minutes after we sat down a sushi chef started bringing supplies out to the sushi bar and apparently BEGAN making our rolls.  They came out eventually but the second specialty roll was the wrong one!  Ugh.  At least we weren't charged for it-- that was appreciated.  It took 50 minutes to get 2 specialty rolls (one of which was wrong) and 1 simple tuna roll. Not cool.    Oh, and the sushi was average tasting."}
{"text":"i was really hoping to like big eye because it is so close to the house and our other regular sushi place went out of business. i went in twice and had the same thing and the rolls were excellent in taste but were very small. much smaller than any rolls ive had recently or that i can remember but were still the same price. service was great the first time and fair the second time. i also like the soy sauce with less salt and they filled that bottle with regular soy sauce. i only tried one bottle so it could of been an accident. unfortunately we will not be going back."}
{"text":"I love this place and i wish i knew this place awhile ago....great staff very cheerful and helpful plus great food....."}
{"text":"The sushi here is very fresh. The tuna and salmon sashimi was delicious and well prepared. The spicy tofu soup is unique and has a tasty kick. Service is courteous. Jason is very good as a server. Sam is an excellent sushi chef."}
{"text":"GREAT sushi place! They have so many special rolls and pictures of each one on the menu. The sushi chefs are very experienced and give you extras many times. The staff is very friendly and it's a great atmosphere. Prices can't be beat! I highly recommend trying."}
{"text":"Good sushi Good service Good prices All day happy hour is amazing, never disappoints Check in with yelp and get a free app."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner one night with friends. Restaurant is located in a strip mall, so parking is plentiful. There's lots of seating, and the location is kind of strange, so a long wait would be pretty unusual.  There's a happy hour menu that's valid all day, every day, with several items for either $3, $4, or $5. There's also a matching happy hour drink menu, and a large, regular menu. We stuck with the happy hour menu and sampled a bunch of stuff. Spicy crab rolls were a little too fishy, with a tiny dot of Sriracha for the entire roll. Avocado roll was small but good. The jalapeno poppers (I forget the exact name) were stuffed with cream cheese and were actually pretty spicy and tasty. A couple other fancier rolls were sampled that were $5 and yummy. I would forgo the $3 section on the menu.  Edamame was fine. A lot of their draft beers were not available, but they definitely had Kirin. The happy hour wine is cheap with a good pour, but it's definitely reminiscent of the $3 Oak Creek bottle at Walmart. Not a bad thing, but don't expect something amazing.  In terms of price, it's hard to beat Big Eye. After getting so much food and 4 drinks, we paid around $30. If you go in with reasonable expectations, you'll find that you get your money's worth, and you'll be happy with your experience."}
{"text":"The first time I called in my order midweek i was very impressed and the staff and food was awesome. Tonight I called and was placed on hold, after 3 minutes on hold I decided to just drive over because I only live a few minutes away. I arrived still on hold (10 minutes now) and when I was told I could sit wherever I politely told the sushi chef I just wanted to place an order to go but I was still on hold after 10 minutes. He very rudely responded with \"Sushi is better served in the restaurant\" and then just ignored me until a very polite hostess came over and asked to help me and got my order in. The restaurant was not busy enough to be on hold for 10 minutes so I'm assuming I was forgotten about and then to be treated poorly when arriving with no apology is unfortunate after having such a good previous experience. I am new to the area so it looks like I will be finding a new sushi restaurant next time."}
{"text":"Came in because it's close to our house, and the sign outside says happy hour all day, well to good to be true. I did not approve of the freshness or quality, I hate to write bad reviews but I won't be back."}
{"text":"First of all, the food here is very marginal. Second of all, the service is very marginal. Third of all, the atmosphere is very marginal. Moreover, the prices are high.  And last but not least, the company's groupon is deceitful. Make sure you show it before the waitress takes your order or else you are in for a rude awakening. I would highly recommend avoiding this place."}
