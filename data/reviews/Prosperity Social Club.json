{"text":"THE BEST fish fry! welcoming, efficient service and an excellent bar... What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Prosperity is one of my neighborhood haunts. I love this place - the atmosphere, food and people are really fun. I've brought my family here when they came to visit and the potato pancakes, bar bowling and sangria pitchers were a huge hit! My only complaint is that the food is quite heavy in general, and there aren't many veggie-friendly options. The pierogies, however, are always a great accomplice for their unique beers."}
{"text":"Prosperity Social Club is an ok bar with ok food with a generic atmosphere.  The service ranges from ok and cheerful to slow and surly depending on which waiter you get.  We had one of the owners as our waiter last visit an he knocked one of our party's hats off the table three times, stepped on the hat, then told us he should wear the hat if he didn't want it to get stepped on.  He was extremely rude and unprofessional.  There are so many bars in Tremont that offer better service and atmosphere that I don't know why Prosperity seems so beloved.  It's ok as a last option if every other bar is packed, but it would never be my first choice."}
{"text":"How do u not love PSC?  Funky ambiance, good food, awesome patio!  Always a good time here!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Low rating because the service was absolutely horrible. They stuck us in a corner and forgot about us the entire time. We had to ask for the check, refills, and a take home box (three times!!!)."}
{"text":"Thank you for the awesome food, awesome service! Food was made to perfection, came out timely and the server was attentive, personable, and followed up to ensure we had everything we needed."}
{"text":"Service was great, mimosas were delicious and food was awesome. What i really like about this place is the amount of vegetarian options, brunch and their normal menu. Usually when i go out to eat, i feel pretty limited. Its nice to find places in cleveland that are up with the times and make cutting out meat a little easier."}
{"text":"I think this place is better at drinks than they are at food. Recently visited on Tuesday night and had one of their special $5 cheeseburgers. It was nothing spectacular. The greek salad I ordered was much better. I still like the funky decor and it looks even better with Christmas decorations."}
{"text":"I've dropped by here a couple times in the earlier evening for a beer and some food and conversation before I go elsewhere.  I understand that later at night it turns into way more of a busy locals-only congregating/ pickup joint, which may or may not be what you're looking for.  When I've been there, it's simply been a nice friendly restaurant-bar with vintage decor, outdoor patio, cute bathroom.  A step up from your average neighborhood dive bar, but not so hoity toity as to draw a ton of tourists.   The beer selection is pretty enticing so I generally have a couple selections from there and don't feel the need to venture into any other types of drinkies.  The menu is more creative than standard \"bar food\" and features several good veggie options and interesting desserts as well as more standard sandwiches and pizza.  They have live bands here occasionally, and while some of the bands are good, be warned the music is loud when it gets going, so be sure to sit well away from the stage if you're planning on hanging around and trying to converse during band hours (or band-warming-up hours)."}
{"text":"A delightful neighborhood bar with delicious pub food -- including incredible fried chicken --Â and a wide selection of draft beers and board games.  The patio is very nice as well."}
{"text":"It's like hanging in a friends basement"}
{"text":"After such a great start here, I eventually stopped going after multiple frustrating experiences. Service can be unbearably slow, and the staff don't handle it well. You could go into a coma at your table before they come by to apologize for the delay or just check in. I am patient when a place seems busy, but when the staff don't seem to care, it's hard to keep going back. I also had quite possibly the worst fish fry of my life here. Overpriced and tasteless to the point of being barely edible.   I'll probably go back at some point, but just for drinks. So disappointed to have a good experience turn bad."}
{"text":"Burgers...amazing. Christmas ale on tap...awesome. Sweet potato fries...priceless. Hipsters...I've seen better."}
{"text":"Fair city of Cleveland, I mean this in the kindest way imaginable, but so many of your bars flood with fratty gentlemen donning Browns jerseys as they sling back Bud Light and watch their over-tanned, bleach blond lady friends sip vodka and Red Bull in bootcut jeans under giant plasma televisions.      I, of course, mean no offense to television nor to bootcut jeans,  but for those who seek respite from the sometime dizzying number of schmucks at bars, Prosperity Social Club is a unique place to start.    Warmly lit, cozy, and kitschy without being pretentious, PSC offers delightful old school cocktails like hot whiskey and Frangelico spiked coffee, as well as more traditional alcoholic fare.  I'm not a connoisseur when it comes to libations, but they carry Le Fin du Monde, a delightful import beer, as well as a strong selection of delicious local drafts.     Beyond what's consumed at Prosperity, it's truly the atmosphere that makes this bar stand out.  As a total stranger to this city, I've felt oddly comfortable and relaxed here and have been able to consistently meet compelling, funny, and witty folks.  Additionally, one of the bartenders has gone out of his way to introduce me to friends and update me on happenings around the neighborhood.      Amid the vast wasteland of bars populated by that inexplicably tacky set of revelers, Prosperity Social Club stands tall as a leg lamp, a beacon of hope for those Clevelanders searching for a more enlightened way to get plastered and stumble home drunk.  May this bar live long and prosper."}
{"text":"I have been to Prosperity for polka night Wednesdays and have been impressed, however after coming to brunch this morning I believe I will now be a regular. Of the five people in our group everyone walked away happy and the prices were very decent (except for the coffee was $3).  We had the eggs blackstone, empanadas, polish breakfast, macaroni and cheese, potato pancakes and biscuits with almond/butter. It was all wonderful, except the the biscuits were a little on the bland side.   The atmosphere was amazing, the service wonderful and I cannot wait to return!"}
{"text":"Wonderful ambiance as an old pub. As a restaurant what a disappointment. The 3 piece chicken dinner was greasy and tasteless. The menu states a leg, thigh and a breast. The breast was a small piece of white meat. It looked like they cut a breast into 4 or more pieces. At 14.50 you should get an entire breast. The pork tenderloin with even worse. It is like they cutoff the scrap pieces you would normally throw away dressed it up and served it to you. Nice place to have a few drinks. If you eat here you will go home starving."}
{"text":"It was overpriced for the quality of the food we got. Sausage gravy breakfast was very bland with lazy man hash brown. Chicken sunshine salad was nothing special for 11$ (throwing in spinach, pre made dry chicken, mandarin orange from a can)"}
{"text":"What a fun and great everybody bar. I caught up with a few friends from tremont that I had not spoken to in a while. They voted we head to P for a night cap and some bored games. The outside patio was super cute and fun but it got a bit chilly so we went inside to warm up. It happened to be the bar's anniversary so there was an array of free food which was all good.   As for Menu and pricing. Everything was fairly moderate with a good beer and booze selection. I did order the spinach dip which was SOOOO good!!!   I would def recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a chill atmosphere during the art walks or recently moved to the Lincoln park area of tremont."}
{"text":"Good food and great cocktails.  A great Cleveland-centric place. The staff is very attentive. If you haven't tried it yet, you definitely should."}
{"text":"5 stars for the massive amount of old school beer advertising. Schlitz globes galore.   I think they have a decent beer selection but it's a little overrun by IPA's 'cause apparently that's what's cool now.....every god damn bar in town is overrun with IPA's now that I think of it. I'll be happy when this fad passes. At least they have Pabst for all the fixie bike kids.   Tolerable crowd with a mix of hipsters, stiff's in khaki's and dirtbags. Ok with me."}
{"text":"I agree with most of the reviews here. My two additional cents:  We went there for Halloween one year, and the costumes were all excellent, and occasionally thought provoking....   That warm cozy feeling is a nice alternative to the many trendy bars in Tremont. Yes, it can be a little hipster, but its always seemed friendly to me.   I heard one of the owners used to work at Night Town. I can see some influences from that, with the nostalgic decor and the friendly service; much more informal though.  The occasional live music has been a blast.   The only down side has been trying to find a table when it's busy."}
{"text":"I would have never made it to this place if a friend didn't invited me to a benefit for a friend. Prosperity is in the lovely neighborhood of Tremont. When I went it was packed, not because of the benefit, but because that is how this place is on a weekend night.  The inside is all wood, very neat and old time charm. There is a bowling machine in the back, which is enough to give it 4 stars alone. The service was lacking, maybe it was the busy night or something, but you can not tell who works there because they dress in street clothes. The beer list is great, and the bar service is fast. The menu has some very good choices for everyone. I got a cheeseburger that was simply amazing. It was seasoned great, and was very juice. The prices are not bad for the size of portions you get and the quality of the food. The patio is great little area to enjoy Tremont and a nice summer night."}
{"text":"Big fan of Prosperity. Great menu, nice eclectic beer and drink selection, staff is always friendly and very knowledgeable.   Atmosphere is awesome, I feel like I'm hanging out in my grandpa's basement (old board games included). I enjoy the homey feeling."}
{"text":"I recently took my first visit to Prosperity, after hearing nothing but good things from friends.  After a busy day, the bf and I didn't want to go home to cook, found ourself near Prosperity and decided to stop in for the last 30 minutes of happy hour (4-7 M-Th, 4-6 Fri).   Draft beers were $1 off, so I chose a Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA from the decent but small selection. The bf got a bottle of Pyramid Apricot Wheat (not a HH special but fairly priced a $4.50).   For food, we split a dozen mussels ($3 HH) -- a bit on the fishy side, but in a garlicy, buttery broth that was great for dipping the accompanying bread in. (Yes, bread was included in the HH portion - a nice surprise.)  I also had an order of vegetarian stuffed grape leaves ($5 HH). Though good, these were a bit bland and, for lack of a better descriptor from memory, wet. However, they were served with sliced cucumbers, tomato, feta (which, let's face it, makes almost anything measurably better) and toasted pita. It was a satisfying and filling-enough spread for the price.  The bf had a heartbreaker burger, topped with banana peppers, gruyuere and a fried egg, and served with fries for $10.50 (not a HH special). He said it was good, though not as good as the burger at Lava Lounge one block away. (Which he has deemed the best burger he's ever eaten.) I stole a few fries, which were okay but greasy and a little cold. However, served with malt vinegar, which is worth extra points (just like the feta).   In short, the food overall is average, which is tough to justify  in Tremont, where so many excellent options abound. However:  The atmosphere was fabulous. Vintage beer and liquor memorabilia line the walls and dangle from the ceiling. A small disco ball spins in the corner. There is an inviting pool table in the back. Music during our stay featured Elvis Costello, the Ramones and the Violent Femmes, among others.  The service was quality. Our bartender was kind, helpful and attentive without being overbearing. Only downside was that the bf received a juice-sized glass (maybe 6 oz) with his bottles of beer rather than a pint glass. (I will never understand why bars do this.)  The people seem to really make this place something special. Regulars abound and strike up conversations with employees. A lone diner at the bar near us struck up a conversation that started with beer and ended with Mr. Show and Mary Lynn Rajskub. I hope we run into him again.  I expect that I will return to Prosperity, often even. I will try other food options -- possibly the veggie empenadas, which sound tasty and our new bar-friend vouched for. I also want to try one if the \"Prosperitini\" offerings, most of which looked tasty and are $2 off their standard $9 or $9.50 during happy hour.   Mostly though, I'll go for the vibe and the company."}
{"text":"Reminds of a restaurant I use to frequent a lot and enjoyed so much. Overall I had a good time and the food was delightful!"}
{"text":"Prosperity is the bomb.com.  I recently celebrated my 40th bday there and the staff was very accomodating.  The mac and cheese is the best.  The atmosphere is great.  Thank you to prosperity for the best bday ever!!!"}
{"text":"I can't believe it's taken me this long to finally write a review for this place.  My friends have begun to make fun of me for how I generally dismiss going to most other bars in Tremont in favor of just coming here.  As someone that generally thrives on change, that's saying something.  I don't know exactly what it is about Prosperity, but if you come with a few good friends you are guaranteed to have a great time.  Laughter and fun just seem to exude from the wood-paneling and old school/kitschy feel.  The food generally isn't anything amazing, but it's more like I end up here and am hungry so I haven't really had any complaints.  They have a  really good draft selection, and also have a good cheap bottle/can selection if you're on a budget.  It's the kind of place you quickly become friends with all the bartenders and other regulars.  I always enjoy the random older movies playing silently in the corners of the bar, and the soundtrack/jukebox is usually quite good.  Definitely a diverse clientele, and it's always interesting to watch the evolution of older dinner crowd to hipster/drunkards on a weekend night.  It's become my unofficial job to be by the pool table and help direct men lost looking for the bathroom in the proper direction.  They have a really nice patio in the summer that evokes hanging out in a friend's backyard all evening, only if this friend had a great beer selection and people taking orders.  If I'm not here on a Friday night, I feel a little empty inside.  I'm not sure if that means I drink too much, but it definitely means this is one great bar."}
{"text":"Surprised my husband with a trip to the west side for his birthday, this is one of our favorite hangouts. We just wish it wasnt so far from us.  The staff is eclectic and personable with great knowledge of the area and their inventory. I think its a great little place with a very neighborhood feel."}
{"text":"Food fantastic. Prices reasonable. Staff helpful and cool. Ambiance----I am not sure there is a better patio in Cleveland. Particularly for smokers....and what smoker doesnt want to smoke as they imbibe. Awesome!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Not the best place but not the worst. Came here with a group of friends. Service wasn't bad. I had the Paloma which is my favorite drink. It was ok didn't taste much grapefruit.   Everyone was so excited to get the pierogies. My husband and I shared the loaded pierogies. They were just ok. The sauce that came with them was yummy. I had a spinach salad. Nothing special.   It was really cold in here and the bathroom is super small and not the cleanest."}
{"text":"The location and unchanged decor warrant 4 stars. The food is decent, but that's not why you go here. One point that I always look for: any restaurant or bar that has a bathroom with a hand dryer/no paper towels and an open-from-the-inside bathroom door gets a black mark. Sadly, this place has such an arrangement."}
{"text":"Pretentious beyond belief. Staff seem perpetually aggrieved. Food's good, wish it had normal people in it."}
{"text":"I like this place  very nice ambience, friendly staff, nice drinks and descent food  I would go there again"}
{"text":"A friendly neighborhood midwestern bar, with a down to earth clientele, nice staff and complete with the midwestern bar music soundtrack, you know and love.  If you grew up in the midwest, and frequented indie-alternative type venues you'll know what I mean.  Going to Prosperity is like going home.  The food is good, bar food, but good, and hey, the even have mussels and some lovely beer battered sweet potato fries to go with your Great Lakes Draft beer."}
{"text":"after another month of basically only going to this bar, i have to upgrade it to a five. this place has become what is just \"the bar\" to me, which is the highest compliment i can offer.   plus, how can you resist the opportunity to ask for your ballantine cap and do all of those rebus puzzles that are WAY harder than the ones in mickeys caps? you can't!"}
{"text":"I came here with a group of about 20. We called ahead, when we got there tables were set up and all ready. The service was excellent. I got the tilapia with cocnut basmati rice and beans. My food was good, I would recommend it but when I go back I will try something else. My husband got the C Town sausage which is a burger with andouille sausage. I don't have a high threshold for spicy things but my husband does. He thought it was delicious. If you are wimpy when it comes to spice I wouldn't recommend the C Town burger. The atmosphere is very nice, they've got board games in the back as well as a pool table and the old bar bowling game. I'll definitely be back. If you're looking for a good place to just hang out and relax this is definitely the place to be."}
{"text":"Traveled all the way from Philly for this experience (not really just for this). I had seen them on a Travel Channel show called Delicious Destination and we could not wait to try it. The pierogi\"s were stuffed full of potato and the sweet and spicy calamari have me thinking of going back a second night!! We went for the fish fry and it did not disappoint. It was hot and crunchy just like it's supposed to be.  The coleslaw reminded me of my mothers and the house made tartar sauce was awesome! I hope to be traveling back this way often for this new found gem."}
{"text":"Walking in I felt like I could have been a flapper girl in the 20's! Came here because I was informed they had a selection of vegetarian options and boy do they! Really enjoyed the veggie stuffed empanadas and the mac and cheese. They had tons of items you could add to the mac n cheese to jazz it up, making it more special than just plain mac n cheese. Also had the tofu chicken wings and wasn't a fan of the buffalo sauce but they were still good when dipped in ranch. Service was great and bartenders were friendly."}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I stopped in for a drink after visiting the Wari exhibit at the Cleveland Museum of Art. Parking was easy...just on the street in front of the bar. Atmosphere was super fun; it felt like it was a dive bar out of the 1950s or 1960s. The BF got a Witte Sour which he wished was a bit colder but really enjoyed. I got a Hot Chocolate Social- a bit on the lukewarm side but absolutely delicious. We also tried a few dishes that were also fantastic. I loved the atmosphere and couldn't wait to head back so a week or two later we went back with a group of friends. However, it just wasn't as nice this time. Food wasn't as good as I remembered, but the main issue was the service. Whereas before the service was pretty friendly, this time the wait staff just acted like everything was a hassle and service was so slow. This wasn't a busy time of the day either, with only two other tables being occupied. Not sure if we just came on an off day or what but not as good as the first time around."}
{"text":"This is a great place, very charming.  Cool decor.  You'll feel at home here.  Super friendly staff.  Great food.  I love their sweet potato fries. Hope to go back there sometime soon!"}
{"text":"I dig it. My favorite bar(The Union, Athens, OH) is too far for me to visit these days, but this place seems to be an acceptable alternative. The prices are fair, especially during happy hour, and the cocktails are interesting. They only have a couple TVs which is nice, and the times I've been there classic movies were playing, not sports center. Thumbs up, Prosperity. I also like the decor which is primarily wood paneling and vintage signage.  The food is really good and the menu is diverse.   Check it out!"}
{"text":"I love Prosperity. It's everything you want in a neighborhood pub. If America hadn't been ruined by freeways and suburbs, and we still lived in villages and hamlets and towns and terrific *neighborhoods* -- like Tremont -- establishments like Prosperity would be plentiful. And we would gather there, and talk to each other, about our lives and the world and how the town is going to the dogs and the country's going to hell and we'd meet new friends and we'd fall in love and we'd feel like part of a community.   And we'd play board games and share amazing macaroni and cheese.   But America's kind of screwed up. Making places like Prosperity even more important. So, go there. You'll like it. I promise. You'll want more places like it."}
{"text":"I love a bar that feels like home - especially one with a killer patio for the summer AND a fireplace for the winter.  With a big selection of beer and affordable (+ tasty) comfort food, this place is a home run.   When most places in Tremont are going for slick and sleek, it's the vintage decor that really makes Prosperity unique and real. It's a neighborhood bar true to the neighborhood its in.  The old school bowling machine is a favorite and the jukebox is loaded with gems.  The crowd in this bar is always a good mix which says something about the owners and staff - everyone is made to feel comfortable here. I've been coming here for years and never had a single complaint. It does get a little crazy the nights of art walk, but what bar in Tremont doesn't.  If you're looking for a place to meet up with friends in Tremont that's as affordable as it is comfortable - you've found your spot."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Sunday afternoon while in Cleveland for a visit. Service was prompt and courteous. We got pierogis for a appetizer and they were great. I got the chicken dinner special and my wife got the stuffed cabbage, both meals were also very good . In short , loved this place and will return."}
{"text":"Prosperity is a breath of fresh air.  There's a lot of Tremont night life spots that are a little higher priced and a bit on the trendy side.  Not that Prosperity isn't- it's very cool.  But it's more of a relaxed vibe.  You can meet your friends here for a brew, sit on the back patio and drink a bottle of wine, or enjoy a burger (a good burger) while sitting at one of the tables. The staff is really laid back and friendly, and it's a place where you can go with friends, to make friends, or just to people watch. In a neighborhood that has become one of the trendy places to go, Prosperity is a everyman's place for good times. Everywoman. i am a girl. there you have it."}
{"text":"Cool, retro Cleveland bar restaurant with excellent food and drinks. What else do you need to know? Give it a try....you will be glad you did."}
{"text":"I'm coming upon my one-year yelpiversary and have recently had my one-year milestone of my big move to the Cleve. Prosperity was my first yelp review, in addition to the first establishment I ever visited in Cleveland. And to me, it's still my favorite. Not just because it's close by and convenient...but because the beer and sangria are great, the food always hits the spot, and I'm always in good company here. Rock on, Prosperity!"}
{"text":"Happy hour, FTW. Try the blackened shrimp taco, it's delicious! Old world night is on Wednesdays, see you out here!"}
{"text":"This place is so relaxed and unique inside. I definitely had no idea what to expect, but ended up pleasantly surprised. The interior has an old feel to it and reminds me of some old country taverns that I used to go to with my parents for burger nights.    Speaking of burger nights! $5 cheeseburgers on Tuesdays are YUMMY. For burger specials, I never expect something truly tasty, but these were so good. We sat at the bar and the service was a bit slow. We didn't get menus upon sitting (weren't asked, even) and it took us awhile to get the bartender's attention for them. When the food came out, I asked for condiments and the man said, \"Brown or yellow?\" (in reference to mustard, though it took me a second...) and I said yellow (glad to have a choice that I don't normally get) and got brown. I like mustard so this was acceptable, but I wondered why I got the choice..   On to beers. The boy likes to ask questions about beer so he can try something new every once in awhile and learn a bit about what he's drinking. He doesn't want an expert, but maybe a description or opinion of a brew. So he did and the man said, \"Dude, it's a beer.\" Which was a little off-putting since he does tend bar....  Overall: Comfortable, tasty, cool and very Clevelandy."}
{"text":"Monday night wing ding doodle and happy hour combination... Sweet... Great wings ,vegan wings, tacos, beer specials, potato pancakes.... loved it... .... don not miss this place... kitchen open late..... nice"}
{"text":"What a great old-school spot and a fantastic meal!  A throwback to neighborhood bar style tavern, but updated to include custom cocktails and scratch-made food.  We came on Friday night for their famous Lenten fish fry and it did not disappoint.  We ordered the full-meal version of the dinner which included  a cup of New England clam chowder, fried fish, pierogis, man-c-cheese and cole slaw.  I started off my meal with a Polish beer called Okicim which was crisp and light and paired well with my fish dish.  The clam chowder came out first and it was creamy and had large, chewy chunks of clam.  One of my dining companions said it was the best New England style chowder she'd ever had.  Then the main plate came out, overflowing with food!  The fried haddock was plump, juicy and flaky with a slightly sweet, crisp batter.  The accompanying tartar sauce was quite tangy and complimented the fish perfectly.  The two pierogis had been finished / grilled on the flattop and topped with caramelized onions and sour cream...delish!  The (shell pasta) mac-n-cheese was super-creamy and gooey and the cole slaw was super-creamy as well.  We were all so super-stuffed that to-go boxes were in order, making for a great leftover meal later.  Anxious to get back some other time and try other things on the menu...heard good things about their burger and fun guy Philly, so we will most certainly be back!"}
{"text":"So I *finally* made it to Prosperity last night after years of hearing about this place.    The Crowd:  It's clear that it's where the locals come to hang.  Unlike some others who have reviewed this joint, I didn't feel that the crowd was overly hipster-ish - not that I mind that sort of thing.  But, it was a Tuesday night.  There was a really touching moment when two guys got up from their table after finishing their meal and actually went up to the bartender to personally thank her for \"everything.\"  And she deserved it - the service was exactly what you want it to be in a place like this - attentive but not overly so.  The Food:  Here in lies the reason for the 3 (rather than 4) stars.  I would not recommend the food.  My companion and I shared the perogies and a steak salad.  The perogies were actually not perogies at all - they were basically ravioli in a heavy pasta shell.  Very \"eh.\"  The salad came out and looked fine, but, as I cut into the steak I realized it was flat out rare (rather than medium rare - which is how I ordered it be prepared).  No biggie - our server happily took the steak back to be put on the grill for a bit longer.  This time, however, it came out well done.  Someone in the kitchen isn't skilled in cooking meat.  It also seemed to be a low-quality cut of meat and I ended up not eating most of it.  What redeems this place:  This place is AWESOME - as long as you do not eat there.  Why?  1.  Expansive beer list + a great selection of beers on tap. 2.  Ski Ball type bowling. 3.  Tons of board games for you + yours to enjoy. 4.  One of the best outside patios I've seen in the city of Cleveland.  I only wish that we hadn't waited until after dinner to go out on the patio - I just had no idea what was back there!  I fully plan on coming back to Prosperity Social Club.  I'll just make sure to eat dinner in advance."}
{"text":"Me: Hi, I'd like a bourbon and coke, please? Bartender: Oh, we can't, we're not allowed to sell liquor on Sundays. Me: ... My brother: Tremont doesn't have Sunday permits? Bartender:  Yeah, most of the wards in this part of Cleveland don't.   Me: *wards, what is this, jail?* Oh.  Huh.  Okay, let me get back to you...  I peruse the beer and wine offerings, my head still spinning [*really? No liquor on Sunday??  Sheesh.*] when I spot sangria as a choice.  Before I get too excited lest the sangria have whiskey or something else that I'm not allowed to drink in it, I make sure it won't be an issue.  The answer's no problem, and he brings it over - I've had better, but I wasn't expecting to get sangria in Cleveland anyhow, and it was pretty decent.  I was satisfied, and if the sangria ended up being a no-go, they do happen to have an extensive selection of beers on tap and various wines so it was no big deal.  Just surprising to me as an out-of-towner.  The decor is somewhat of a shrine to disco balls - itty bitty ones nestled in nooks and crannies, big huge ones looming over the wooden floors and tables, standard sizes scattered throughout.  The jukebox selection was great - all sorts of different genres represented, and my brother the big industrial/goth/noise fan was pleasantly surprised.  It appears they offer live music from time to time as well, from looking at the posters in the bathroom.  I was intrigued by the bowling machine in the back - I didn't play, but it looked like it could be quite entertaining.    My brother and I split the BBQ rib special, and we both thought it was delicious.  The meat was falling off the bone and practically melted upon contact with the tongue, while the sauce was sweet but had just enough kick to stand out.  The fries were golden with a nice crisp to them, skin still on.  After reading the other reviews here, it sounds like we made a good choice food-wise since I was contemplating other dishes that seem to have been panned here.  At $11 or so (a little less than most of their other dishes), I'd say the ribs were worth it, but there were other items on the menu that were priced high enough to where if I had ordered something else and it sucked, I would've been annoyed.   The bartenders were friendly and service was prompt - nice people, chill atmosphere...if I lived here, I could see myself being a regular.    3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Wants to be a speakeasy but it's really just another bar.  Drinks are overpriced but strong!  Very crowded. Loved the live music but couldn't see where it was coming from.. After a $90 round and twenty minutes, we moved on rather quickly.  Oh and an annoying creepy camera man was everywhere."}
{"text":"Prosperity, you scream Cleveland on so many levels, from the rotating Schlitz sign, to your depression era bar (gorgeous art deco), to the stuffed cabbage and burgers. You almost always have pear cider on tap. The best part about you (besides $5 cheeseburger Tuesdays)? You're unpretensious and cool at the same time. You are hip just by being you. Prosperity, I vote for you for County Executive.   Tip: Their kitchen is open till 2 Wed-Saturday. They have a patio in the back, past the mini bowling machine.  Check their site for nightly specials...they're worth it. I swear I don't work for them. I just love it!"}
{"text":"You must have the stuffed cabbage! WOW!  I came here on a walking tour so I didn't get the full service experience as our food was pre-ordered and ready when we got there. I can say that the food was amazing. The stuffed cabbage has a different sauce than most - it was also better than 90% I have ever had!  It definitely represents Tremont's eastern European heritage with a Hungarian flair. It has very dark wood inside and is somewhat dive-y, but in the best possible way. They had quite a bit of good beer on tap and seemed like they had some fun things going on. I cannot wait to go back for dinner and drinks with friends!"}
{"text":"3 stars for the food 2 stars for the service 4 stars for ambience  I really like this place.  It has an old school vibe...albeit a bit too old school to the point I felt like the chair I was sitting in could cave out from underneath me because the wood was so thin... Dichotomy of hipsters vs. Older folks in their 50s...Dipping sauces like the bacon aioli and thai sauce are necessary with the fries...yummo.  Beer-battered fish was good, said my friend.  I opted for the buffalo chicken sandwich and it was alright.  I have had better.  French fries are long, skinny fries that needed seasoning.  Hello salt shaker.  And they tasted a little off to me.  Must be the oil they are fried in.  It tasted like fish to me.  Perhaps my fries took an immediate bath in the same oil as my friend's beer battered fish?  Service was very slow.  Our server was MIA for a while and even though we asked for our check, he forgot, and we had to remind him.  Noise in this place can be a big headache.  There was a party in the back room that was SO LOUD.  Combine that with a band playing and well, you get the picture...enjoy the shouting match across the table.  Having a first date here would be a nightmare.  Mac and cheese looked good but I restrained myself... Compared to other Tremont eating establishments, this place has a unique vibe but be willing to sacrifice food quality (and seasoning) for said vibe."}
{"text":"I went to prosperity this morning for brunch and really enjoyed it.  When we walked in there was a crowd of people waiting to be seated as it appears there was no one taking names, however, we were seated very quickly.  It took our server some time to take our drink and food order (she was very friendly and apologetic) and the food took some time to come but once our bloody Mary's came we didn't mind the wait.  The bloodys were delicious and came garnished with cheese, pickles, and olives with a spicy salt rim.  My friend and I each ordered the eggs black stone (a modified eggs Benedict) which came home fries with peppers and onions mixed in.  We both loved it and cleaned the plate.  Not local to Cleveland but this place was a highlight!"}
{"text":"My friends and I, all over age, sat down at a table to order food and drinks and we were immediately denied drinks based on our festive appearance from a small holiday gathering we had attended. The servers generalized us with a holiday-themed day drinking event that we did not partake in. They were extremely rude and condescending. We walked out and don't plan on ever walking back in."}
{"text":"Disappointing brunch! Have been here many times for food/drinks but decided to try brunch for the first time.  The sausage biscuits & gravy was awful- gravy was watery, barely any sausage and the biscuits were stale and soggy! Definitely not fresh. The breakfast potatoes also tasted stale. The eggs Benedict florentine was OK- not crazy about the Hollandaise sauce- also very watery and bland. Definitely won't go back for brunch...."}
{"text":"My happy place!! Great beer selection, fun vintage-y environment.. and an absolutely STELLAR Lenten fish fry that my husband and I wait all year for!"}
{"text":"I have dined here three times now, once was for the Friday fish fry during lent. I would exclude that occasion due to circumstance except I accidently ordered a boozy hot chocolate..  oh hell yeah, next time you are cold or looking for a desert drink stop by and have one of those bad boys.  I ad to try the Ruben on potato pancakes the second time.  The pancakes were quite heavy, I understand they are taking the place of bread but they could have sacrificed size for quality on those.  Otherwise it was pretty tasty.  Finally let's get to the goods.  I have been to the big easy and many parts of the south,. Just recently was.in Hilton Head, and had this dish.  One of my go to meals on the south.  Shrimp and grits. I had them at Property and  Hats off to the chef, it was so good and had that comfort in the tummy feeling.  Just a touch of chorizo and the right amount of cheese..  ding ding winner winner, pair it with the habenero margarita and pow a tasty tasty meal."}
{"text":"Went for a bite and drinks with a mixed group of coworkers.  One of the group is a regular.  The environment felt casual/fun/local, we went through and sat on the back patio, which could have been a friends home it was cozy with the lights as it turned dark.  Beer and wine lists had some of my favs, yet was not overwhelmingly long.  The menu had a cool variety too.  I split panko crusted oysters, yep just as suspected anything in panko crust is delicious.   For dinner I had the pork empanadas, and they tasted homemade.  The crust was flaky and buttery.  Others at the table had the fish fry/ french fries, and pretzel pork loin.  The pork loin portion was HUGE, 2 giant steaks, def enough to split this dish.  Overall enjoyed this little understated spot in Tremont."}
{"text":"Great Cleveland gem located in tremont.  Went here for brunch on a sat around 2. As a bar this place is amazing. As a place to eat, not so much.  Staff was attentive and service was fast.  Food is horrible though. Ordered the sunrise mac and cheese. Bland, looked horrible too. If it was 2 am and I was drunk I might really be into this but it tasted like a TV dinner or a failed potluck crockpot creation from your local church fundraiser.  Considering brunch here? Pass.  Considering the sunrise Mac and cheese? Run!"}
{"text":"We found this local little gem in yelp and it came thru beautifully! It was a Saturday morning about 11am, found it easily. Right across the street from a pretty park with nice playground equipment and trees.  Anyway, parked right on the street, walked in and we're seated right away.  First impression is kinda dive-ish,  but those are the best places! Dark wood, vintage tables.   They gave us the brunch menu which had quite a few choices.  I had the biscuits and gravy. Came with i think either 2 or 3 biscuits, plenty of sausage and gravy.  Plus 2 eggs and potatoes.  It was super good.  My partner had the country breakfast with perogies,  eggs, kielbasa,  potatoes. Also really good.  We had a side of potato pancakes which were over the top.  The server was super nice and very good.  Oh, I also had 2 bloody Mary's (don't judge) that were tasty with a nice little garnish with a chunk of cheese and onion and olive.  I'd come back!"}
{"text":"Am I biased because this is the closest bar to my home, my go-to place to meet friends, and the place where I met my wife? Yes. Do I still have good objective reasons for a 5-star review? Yes.   Even before I moved to Tremont, Prosperity struck me as a spot with a great diversity in clientele. It's true that hipsters can be found here, but so can yuppies, blue collar, and folks of all ages. My parents love this place. The staff is helpful and considerate considering the occasional density of the crowd and migratory patterns of table dwellers. Bonnie, the owner, makes it clear to me and my friends that she personally appreciates us coming into her place and enjoying it. I love nearly everything on the menu, and many of the weekly specials are worth taking advantage of.   The only 2 issues that I can think of is price of drinks and level of crowd on some nights. Some drinks are a little more expensive than you will find elsewhere, but they are balanced by cheaper beers and some happy hour specials. You can drink cheap here if you like. Between the hours of 8 and 10 on certain weekend nights, it can get very very packed. It does seem sporadic. But by 10:30, the situation improves. During the summer, this is barely an issue due to the awesome patio.   Lastly, I just love the decor in this place. My wife and I loved it so much we took our wedding pictures here. Art-deco meets rumpus room: top notch."}
{"text":"I had biscuit & gravy with chicken for Sunday brunch. Good service and the food was delicious. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"It was really loud in here... not the people, but the music. Every song was at a different level of volume and when the louder ones came on it was rather jarring.  There draft selection is small. When I go to a bar I want to drink draft. Beer tastes better that way. Minus points.  The food was mixed. The pierogies were good, but my entrÃ©e was really mediocre. I had the veggie empanadas and they had no flavor apart from the crust. The dipping cream sauce was glaringly slight in proportion and  completely out-gunned by the crust flavor. The rice and beans that came along were boring--I've had worse and much better. I can't believe how much they charged me for crap food.  The waitress was friendly and timely, but she didn't bring small plates with the appetizer, and I had to request cutlery. These are pretty standard details in my book.  There wasn't enough to warrant a second chance."}
{"text":"There are bars where people go because hey, it's in walking distance from your house.  And you know the staff because it's your default choice when you don't know where else to go out to eat, and the folks in the neighborhood congregate here anyway, and when you stroll in you see the staff and the people at the bar talking to each other like they were old friends.  That's the Prosperity Social Club.  It's where the locals in Tremont hang out to drink.    The Social Club is a good place to drink, because they have a pretty decent selection of beers (I had a cherry-infused German beer that wasn't quite a lambic, and a Belgian ale that had an ephemeral, fruity aftertaste that none of us could name), and nice cocktails.  They're not fancy, written on the blackboard, but they're there and they're good to fuel some pleasant conversation.   The food?  Well, it was reasonably cheap, and not terribly good.  I had some hummus, which was a little grainy and flavorless (but the pita was freshly toasted.... mmmm).  Then I had a corned beef sandwich on potato pancakes, and the corned beef was as dry as the pancakes.     But you know what?  I didn't care.  Because I was out talking about movies with friends, and it was a cozy, lived-in atmosphere, and I suspect that most of the people who like this place like it because the food's not so awful that you'd send it back, and it's relatively cheap, and you can talk until late into the night and have an attentive waitress bring you more booze.  Nothing wrong with that."}
{"text":"Might actually be my favorite bar in Cleveland.  I'll need to go back again to be sure, though.  It's a bit difficult to judge after 1 visit.  The pros: -Cider on tap (and they had pear cider the night I was here!!!) -Fairly priced drinks (not cheap, but not over-the-top) -Fairly spacious -Eclectic crowd -Moderate noise-level -Board games!  The cons: -While spacious, it was packed. -Food appeared to be expensive, but I didn't actually order any.  Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"the food is not good.  but, we were out on the back patio, the waitresses were super nice, and the drinks were good, we had a great time.  plus there is bar bowling!  it was a great summer night."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, I love going to the pretentious restaurants in Tremont -- admiring the dishes that look like beautiful works of art and cocktails dreamed up by mixologists all the while listening to people at adjoining tables debate what is required for the perfect brunch or talk about their recent work in France. But sometimes I want to relax in a more casual atmosphere while still enjoying food that doesn't insult my senses (OK, that sounded pretentious). And in Tremont, one of those place is Prosperity Social Club. Jeannene and I were there on Thursday and it really is the perfect spot for a rainy autumn evening. Drinking Old-Fashioneds (no special ingredients -- just the classics) and listening to old men at the bar talk about what OSU needs to do to win it all this year, we settled into a table where I could see a couple of TVs tuned to ESPN and TMC, I think. As for the food, I think it was actually better than I remember. Our appetizer was the potato pancakes with apple and cranberry chutney ($9) and there wasn't anything fancy to it -- three dense pancakes with a thick chutney that came with a bit of a kick to it.  As for the main courses, I had the fish fry ($14) which came with several pieces of battered whitefish and thick-cut sweet potato fries. The batter on the fish was unbelievable light though I probably should have used the salt shaker on the whole dish. Jeannene ordered the pork loin ($15) that came wrapped in bacon on a mound of smashed potatoes and spinach. I tried a bite when it arrived and then spent most of the meal figuring out how soon I could get back here to order it myself. The pork was a moist medium well and the thick-cut bacon was nice and crisp to give the dish some bite and the potatoes were just the thing for a cold rainy autumn evening. We skipped dessert though the bread pudding sounded perfect for the weather. This is the type of place where every aspect is 3 stars but when combined it generates a truly 4-star experience on a non-pretentious evening."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  The ambiance is great and this place is definitely worth a repeat visit.  Hidden gem!"}
{"text":"So I clearly made bad choices here, but I can only review based on my experience. I went with some friends to the very popular Friday Fish Fry they do weekly during Lent. Prosperity is an old (Polish) Cleveland dive, but on these Fridays it is packed. We made reservations in advance (highly recommend you do the same) and were advised that the table would be for 90 min unless we gave them notice ahead of time that we needed it for longer and that if we showed up more than 15min late we would lose the table--both stipulations seem fair to me, given how popular these dinners are.   I made the mistake of ordering sangria and paella, both of which sounded great in theory but in retrospect were clearly not the right choice given the setting. Don't order cocktails here, stick with beer. Also, go with tradition and get the fried fish dinner--this, and not fancy schmancy paella, is why the fish fries are so popular. My friends all ordered the fried fish and reported it to be decent. The paella was bland and the fish tasted a little tinny. Even adding a liberal dose of salt and pepper couldn't perk it up. Just as you wouldn't order a steak at a pizza joint, be sensible and stick with traditional pub fare here.  Also, I hate to gripe but it was confusingly cold. The place was packed with people, yet I wanted to put my down coat back on 15 min after we sat down."}
{"text":"When i make a home in a new city (i just moved to cleveland this summer), i like to make one place where i go when i need a drink after work, or just want to be lazy.  A good bar. I just like warm environments (inviting). Prosperity is a very very warm bar. its very homey. You instantly feel comfortable. I know that because i went to a few other places in the area the same night.   I hadn't gotten to see much of the bars scene in tremont, so i thought we would start at the bar with the most amazing \"pub\" front: Lincoln Park Pub. It had an awkward set up, and although it has lots of T.V's, it was very starck. So we walked over to prosperity. It was amazing. Low but bright lights, loud music (still soft enough to talk), Everyone seems to be smiling, everything is made of wood. Its just a incrediable vibe of friendliness. I must admit, we sat at a table, and our waitress was helpful and kind.  I don't know how the bar service was (will find out soon). It was wonderful being there though. lots of different seasonal Ales. I really enjoyed myself. I am happy i finally found a place to call \"the bar\".     I know this might sound weird. But cleveland has alot that disconnects the communities, mainly huge roads and highways that section off the entire city. I don't really ever feel like i am part of a community or a member of the city. But Prosperity made me feel like i was in a club. Like there are others just like me in cleveland. It was very grounded in community and everyone knew each other.  I can't wait to go back tonight. I hear the food is wonderful and i am going to try it right away!"}
{"text":"Super disappointed. Love the interior and that there is a wood burning fireplace, but something in there kicked up my allergies and made my eye all inflamed and watery. Service was lacking. For water and then they forgot us. We ordered the haddock which came with cold, looked like they were a slightly better version of Southern Hashbrowns from the Ore-Ida bag. Cole slaw was a creamy blob. While the haddock was good, it wasn't worth $27.90 for two servings. The coffee was very good, but had to ask for a warm up and it wasn't hot. Was it $3 good coffee, um, No! For these prices, I want to be wowed and I was not.   Cool interior, won't be back."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere here. And they have one of the best Paloma's I've ever had. Can be a. Little expensive at times but it's still worth going to. The bartenders are always really cool."}
{"text":"This is a tough review.  The place looks somewhat inviting from the outside.  When you go in it has character, but it depends on what you are looking for.  If you are looking for a quaint bistro to have brunch and environment is important, this is not the place, unless you sit outside and even then not the best.  The interior is loaded for character, but mote for drinking.  It was cool inside which was nice but we were in quaint brunch mode so we sat outside in the back.  The food was good.  I had biscuits and sausage gravy with potatoes and eggs.  Good portion size, filling but not crazy.  We also had hamburger and potatoes, food.  And the wake up epenada was good as well.    Its a bit pricey considering the environment but I liked the coffee and it was in a glass mug too.  Worth a try but a little pricey for the environment.   There is a reason Grumpy's is always packed: good food, a bit cheaper and environment.  But eating at the same place is boring so its nice to try new places like this one.   Actual score is around 3.7"}
{"text":"The most welcoming and essentially Cleveland spot I have visited in some time.  My friend and I stopped in for a Friday lunch Fish fry. I sampled my friend's fish, but was only allowed two bites, because it was a crisp and delicious Haddock, better than any other local fish fry we have tried.  I had the portobello sandwich. It sounds like a healthy choice, and it is,but the kitchen has made this option a comfort food.   The house made chips served with both dishes were crisp and good, but ever so slightly under seasoned.  The conviviality of Prosperity was enhanced during our visit because they were hosting a wedding at the same time. The fact that our orders came out promptly, and so well speaks volumes about the efficacy of what is reported to be a small kitchen."}
{"text":"We found this on a whim.  Walked in and we were seated quickly.  Coffee was pretty good.  Polish Breakfast: I liked the portion size, you could ideally save half for breakfast the next morning. I never had pierogies for breakfast, it was an interesting experience. the kielbaski was yummy.  I didn't finish the eggs and potatoes because there was just too much and you have to go in order of expense/meat, then specialty item, and leave the potatoes and eggs. I'd eat this again.  Eggs Blackstone: My girlfriend got this. I had a bit of it.  It was pretty good.  I think the combination of the egg, tomato, bacon and spinach with the hollandaise sauce was good.  I'm not a big fan of poached eggs and Hollandaise, but if you like that kind of stuff, my gf finished the entire meal.  That good!  Overall impression: I'd recommend this place, I'd go back, maybe for dinner or drinks.  I'm sure this place has a different feel at night versus brunch."}
{"text":"Went to Prosperity Social Club on a Wednesday night which is Polka night!  Enjoyed the music and the atmosphere very much!  I was there with four friends and we all enjoyed our food and drinks.  I ordered the Reuben sandwich which was made with potato pancakes instead of bread -- yum!   The service was attentive and we are planning to come back soon!"}
{"text":"Sunday night Fried Chicken! The service and atmosphere is always great.   This is the place to go for delicious comfort food in tremont."}
{"text":"The name of this pub came off as somewhat pretentious to me so I was quite hesitant to come here at first. However, I'm glad I did check it out because it was far from that! I came here a couple of nights ago with a large group for dinner. The pub was very accommodating and reserved the back room tables for us. We ordered a bunch of different appetizers to share:  - Spinach and artichoke dip: Very flavorful! Definitely want to get these again!  - Fried oysters: I've never imagined fried oysters to taste this good. The sauce was absolutely amazing!  - Potato pancakes: simply lovely! I love the tangy sauce that came with it!  - Pierogies: not very impressed by these! A little too expensive for the portion size. - Mussels: Also not very impressed by these.  For my entree, I got the reuben pancake, which I was not very pleased with. I normally love reuben sandwiches, but I think this place made it a bit too sour. The pancakes that came with it were also a little burnt.   Overall, I'm fairly satisfied with the appetizers but not so much the entree. Would probably come back again to try out their drinks!"}
{"text":"Funny how things change.  ...for the better!  THE UP-SIDE:  I am happy to report that this cool Tremont lounge - er, \"social club\" - is getting better and better.   First, the food has improved in a major way.  Whereas my first experiences here were all pretty crummy in terms of food quality and portion size, things have definitely taken a turn for tastier and more-for-the-money.  The last four or five times I've been here, the food has been great.  Second, the deluge of hipsters has quieted.  The crowd here now seems much more chill and far less \"in crowd.\"  It's actually quite pleasant to hang here, and my friends and I often do.  Third, the patio.  The back patio is probably my favorite in Cleveland.  It feels like the back patio of your best friend's mom and dad's house.  The vibe is relaxed, the lighting at night sparse and perfect, and the seating far less cramped than many Tremont establishments.  THE DOWN-SIDE:  Happy to say, no real downside.  Things have improved.  THE SUM-IT-UP:  Hooray for change!  :-)"}
{"text":"Always clean. Always get prompt service. Always a great time! Nice draft choices & bartenders are skilled making cocktails. Fun patio  These are my favorites of favorites on the menu: BLACKENED TILAPIA BLT       Bacon aioli, toasted herbed focaccia (I prefer w/ ciabatta)  KILLER GOUDA BURGER     Black Angus beef, smoked Gouda, bacon, lettuce, tomato. Topped with two homemade onion rings and spicy soy-mayo sauce on toasted ciabatta bun.  REUBEN ON POTATO PANCAKES      House-cooked corned beef, Swiss cheese, sauerkraut and thousand island dressing between two potato cakes  OLD WORLD WEDNESDAY's food specials are truly amazing too.   PS  Finally a decent website!"}
{"text":"Prosperity seemed like your average bar when I visited.  It's a classic, small time place with average drinks and food.  From reading the reviews I expected way more but the whole place just seemed overhyped.  I'm not too much of  decor person when it comes to bars because it's a bar and as long as the drinks are good, I could care less what kitschy knick-knacks you have lying around.  For the record, the drinks were average yet somehow also a tad on the pricey side.  Maybe we were charged a \"special\" Prosperity price.  There just wasn't much going on here (non-descript band, half-filled tables with a mix of all kinds of people) to make me think that the crowd, the music and the ambiance were any different than any other night at Prosperity.  I guess I'm out of the loop on this one.  I jus't don't know what's so special about this place."}
{"text":"Great place for a chill evening with friends.  The happy hour and nightly specials are pretty great ($3 pints all night on Mondays!).  Food is standard/good bar fare, and they do have several vegetarian options.  Fridays and Saturdays can get a bit loud and busy, but most other days it's pretty laid back.  In warm weather the patio is perfect, though you are competing with the smokers for tables.  Overall, Prosperity is a great place to hang if you're in the Tremont neighborhood."}
{"text":"From what I remember of Prosperity, it was a cool place. I have a bit of amnesia though since I had quite a bit to drink before I darkened their door.  I had a really good beer. Kentucky Bourbon Barrell Ale. It tasted like buttah. I would go back just for that. And it was on tap. I was making everyone taste it - even strangers. How annoying was I?   One of the bartenders reminded me of David Sedaris. +1 to him.  I appreciate the fact that they have board games to play. I didn't do that though because I'm sure I would have sucked being that I was all krunked up."}
{"text":"My dad and I stopped in here for dinner on our way to New York. After browsing on yelp for a long time we settled on this restaurant based on the good reviews and the appealing menu. And I'm so glad we did!! We were seated right away on the patio in the back and it was a beautiful, sunny summer night. The waiter came almost instantly and brought us water and gave us ample time to check out the menu. I ordered the house salad and the $10 Thursday Steak & fries special. The salad was delicious (especially the dressing), the steak was cooked to perfection, and the fries were absolutely to die for. For dessert I tried this amazing pecan-caramel pie type thing with ice cream and maple sugar glaze as the waiter recommended to us and it was so good! The wait for the food was just right and the atmosphere was very hip and artsy. The service was great- very friendly and quick. The bar area was especially packed but it was as expected as we were there during happy hour. I would recommend this lovely restaurant to anyone!"}
{"text":"I had the city chicken or something, which was awful but the loaded pirogies were amazing! I was with 4 other people and they all loved their entrees. I will be back! :)"}
{"text":"Hipster heaven... but I'm not mad about it. It was a cool, chill place, and the beers were cheap! Walking distance from my friend's place... can't go wrong. Would definitely return next time I'm in Cleve."}
{"text":"We were excited to try another new place. Sat down.  Had 3 servers total. First dropped off water. Second came by 10 mins later or so to take drinks.  Bloody Mary's arrived after a few minutes.  New server. She was nice.  No avacado. No empanadas. By the time we ordered no more southern omelette.  Waited 37 minutes from the time we ordered to receive an omelette and an order of biscuits and gravy.  The omelette, he wasn't a fan of so we saved the eggs for our pup.  The sausage gravy - well o don't know if it was sausage gravy bec there wasn't any sausage.   It wasn't bad.   Eggs on the side for the dog again.  Blood orange mimosa was good.    I know we won't be back- but others may have a better experience."}
{"text":"Went there for brunch and was not disappointed. I got the Hungarian breakfast, which was huge! Really cool atmosphere. Service was OK. Would go back again."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place.  I happened upon this  spot on a Wednesday night which happened to be Old World Night.  The live music was fun.  The food prices were very reasonable especially for such good food.  The portions weren't very large but not unsatisfactory.  My only real complaint is the horrible televisions.  I had a nicer tv in my bedroom in the 3rd grade.  I woulda liked to have been able to watch the Cavs game from more than 4 foot away.  The service/staff was very laid back, but attentive which is my preference.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Prosperity Social Club was first introduced to me by co-workers at the Flying Fig. I have been going there somewhat loosely for over two years now.  I am surprised that so few people have mentioned the karaoke nights (the 3rd Monday of every month), given that it's the best karaoke I've experienced in Cleveland. The host is awesome, there's usually some good singers, and the crowd is friendly enough to clap along with people who are struggling through a tune.  They have this pear cider on tap. It's delicious.  I have been coming here more lately, as it's not quite as crowded as some of our favorite spots on West 25th. Everyone is friendly, the patrons, the staff, the owner. And they play TMC on their TV's. I watched parts of the Dead Poets Society the other evening.  And when you're finished with your drinking, you can grab a friend and hit the playground across the street for some swinging, with the Cleveland skyline off in the distance."}
{"text":"Definitely high on my list of places to go in Cleveland. Groovy old bar with an excellent selection of brews.  I have only eaten here a couple times. I've had the fish fry and the mussels. The fish was excellent, perfectly breaded and crispy. The sweet potato fries were a welcome addition. The mussels were great too. Lots of flavorful broth to soak up with bread. I see that the food gets mixed reviews. Maybe I lucked out and hit it on good nights. We'll see what happens next time...  One of my only gripes is that they seem to pack way too many tables in the main area. It's difficult to get from the bar to the bathroom without squeezing by in a maze-like fashion. Thankfully, there's a nice patio out back with vintage chairs."}
{"text":"Took the family to Cleveland for a mini vacation last week.  You know, Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and all.  Stopped in that Thursday night for dinner.  This place is absolutely FANTASTIC!  They looked busy when we arrived but we only waited a couple of minutes for a table.  Lots of great beers on tap but since they're known for their Polish food I ordered an Okicim (when in Rome).  I ordered the Kishka sandwich and the Mrs. ordered the reuben with potato pancakes instead of bread.  We also ordered the loaded pierogi to start with.  Both food and service were totally AMAZING!  You get a ton of food for the price.  They don't have a kids menu but the Thursday night special was a 14oz steak and fries for $11.  My son finished it all.  I was able to steal a bite of steak and it was surprisingly delicious.  Do yourself a favor and when in Cleveland stop by this awesome place!"}
{"text":"Great location right off I-71 or I-90. This neighborhood is in a noticeable gentrification phase, and I hope that it sticks this time. It's not the first time that it's attempted a turn around.   The fish fry is solid and the place was jumping tonight as it's Lent and also Andrew Zimmern featured PSC on Delicious Destinations. Tip...Get a reservation on Fridays during Lent. They'll hold your table 15 minutes over the time chosen, and you're allotted 1.5 hours to finish up. We arrived at 4:40 for a 4:00 reservation, but they were super cool and gave us a table until 6:00. We ordered while being seated, and were on our way out at 5:25. We didn't want to be THAT party.  The interior is completely the kind of place that you would have gone with your Dad on a weekend while he grabbed a beer and sandwich, and you messed around with the jukebox and or pinball machine."}
{"text":"Prosperity is one of a kind. Comes equipped with a beautiful retro style patio and when winter hits us here in Cleveland (and we normally get hit pretty hard) there is a level of comfort provided by the wood burning stove and cozy art deco interior. The menu is a little hard to get into at first, being as it's very eclectic. But once you do, it's damn good. They have one of my most favorite cheeseburgers in Cleveland! The perogies always on point and you can't beat their $10 strip steak night, definitely a good piece of meat for the price. Great beer selection. Dare I start raving about the bartenders! John and Brian are my absolute fave. They know me, they know what I drink. It's everything you can ask for in a regular hang out spot. Love love love Prosperity!"}
{"text":"I came here because I was looking for a good local Cleveland spot with some great pierogies.  Now, this may have been my own fault since I'm a fan of the regular, old school potato and cheese pierogies without too many bells and whistles besides some onion and sour cream - but I got the loaded pierogies. Basically your run-of-the-mill pierogies but with bacon, cheddar cheese and fried onions on top.  Don't get me wrong - they were very good, but a bit TOO fried to my liking, where JukeBox's pierogies had more of the old-school feel of some crispy parts but also some chewiness to them too.  Yes, I'm picky about pierogies. Not gonna lie. I also ordered the potato pancakes since they were only $5 on happy hour and was not at all impressed. It came with two pancakes but I only ate not even half of one.   But that's ok - my service was great and the bartender was very nice. I still did enjoy this place but would go to JukeBox over here for some quality old school pierogies."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME. Definitely one the best neighborhood bars around, especially in the Tremont area.   The food is great and the bartenders--especially John--are the best! TCM is always on the TVs and the bar has a laid-back retro vibe, but very inviting.   I would definitely stop into this place first before any other bars in Tremont, you should too."}
{"text":"I love this place! I have been for dinner, late night, and brunch, and have never been disappointed. Attentive and friendly staff, always available to make suggestions or customize an order if you need it. I've seen some live music here too and it was a lot of fun. I'm adding Prosperity to my list of go-to establishments in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite bar in Cleveland.  This place does low key, Old School Cool like no other.  I love the staff here.  They are super friendly and always seem to know exactly what you need, even before you do.  The cocktails and beer list are extensive and creative.  The menu is awesome with lots of options for vegetarians as well as for the meat and potatoes crowd.  There are nightly specials and sometimes they have live music or other fun events.  The patio is one of Tremont's hidden gems."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch last weekend and it was fabulous. Service was great and my food was very enjoyable. I had the empanada stuffed with sausage, eggs and other goodies. It was mildly spicy, the breading was good and the potatoes were good. Not quite 5 star food, but definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"This building has been here for years since I was kid. Not much has changed has very nostalgic look that fits Tremont. The ambience is great, the staff was great, the drinks were good the food was good.. Its worth the trip just to see the inside of the bar."}
{"text":"Have you ever wondered what a hipster bar looks like? I mean, really thought about it? If someone were looking for a location for a movie and the scene called for \"hipster bar\" this place nails it. It's got it all - board games, Schlitz beer tchotchke, $2 PBR in cans listed next to $10.50 sugar-tinis, irony, young, bespectacled bearded guy dressed in rumpled sportscoat worn over \"vintage\" tee, a slight sticky feeling, faint aroma of stale nicotine from decades of chainsmokers, local blue-collars not willing to relinquish their bar so they remain steadfast reminders of the past. I was blown away by the overwhelming stereotypes. This couldn't be real. Where are the dollies and cameras?  I'm not sure where I stand with this place. Part of me really likes the dive bar feel, the history of the well-worn front door, the plastic floor tiles circa 1960, the beer steins dotting the walls. And part of me is sad. Why wasn't I blown away like everyone else? I wanted to be, really I did. But five-star reviews? Really? Was I even in the same bar? Maybe it just isn't for me. I don't do karaoke, I'm not out trawling for women, and I don't go to bars just to drink anymore. I'm thinking that's probably why. It has to be. After all, unless there has been some tear in the space-time continuum I had to have been at the same Prosperity Social Club everyone else went to, right? Maybe it gets better when it's dark outside. Maybe that's when the magic happens. OK, enough of that, let's get on with our experience.  It's about 6pm on a Thursday. Parking? No problem, nabbed a spot right out front on the street. Seating? The place was practically empty. As seems to happen in places like PSC you can't really be sure what to do when you walk in because there's no hostess and it's laid out like a restaurant. We had to ask the bartender what to do. \"Sit wherever\", was the response. There are plenty of tables and a pretty long bar. Why are there numbers on the tables?Anyway, we took a seat and waited.  One of the bartenders wandered out from behind the bar and proceeded to take our order. Wow, these chairs feel like they're going to break into a thousand pieces underneath me. And talk about your sticky tables. Anyway, moving on. The menu is quite large for a bar that serves food and it doesn't really seem to follow any particular style or ethnicity. Mussels, pierogi, vegetarian curry, empanadas, pulled pork, coconut basmati rice. Calling this eclectic would be like calling Woody Allen Jewish.    Blackened Tilapia BLT - Not a bad sandwich. The herb focaccia bread was a nice touch albeit a tad thick and who doesn't love some bacon aioli? The fish was cooked well, tender and moist, and it does come with some heat so be warned.  Beer-battered Onion Rings - One word, bland. They looked a hell of a lot better than they tasted. Why the hell don't places season their freakin' batter? Is there some fear of salt running rampant through Cleveland? Sure, they were big. They are about the size of donuts. But the batter ended up being a greasy, boring disappointment.  Traditional Cole Slaw - As some of my regular readers may know, I am a Cole slaw snob. For me, it's mayo-based, it's gotta be sweet, cabbage and carrots only, that's it. PSC's slaw wasn't bad. It's swimming in mayo sauce and they've basically stuck to the playlist. It would have gone great on top of a pulled pork though.  Sweet Potato Fries - These were interesting. Tempura battered and fried sticks of orangy, complex carby goodness. They were crispy and hot but, again, no seasoning.  Harissa Chicken Cobb Salad - This would make Elaine's big salad run away in terror. Massive and full of everything except chicken. Plenty of chopped romaine, bacon, cucumbers, bleu cheese, and the basil vinaigrette was killer. But where the hell was all the chicken? For a salad that costs almost $12 I expected there to be an entire chicken breast on the thing. I had to dig to find the few pieces of chicken they gave me. What I had was good, though. The harissa spice (more of a dry rub than a sauce) was tasty but the chicken was a bit dry and stringy.  The service we had was good. She was friendly, she brought us waters as soon as we sat down and she checked in a few times to see how things were going but wasn't intrusive. We were even asked about dessert. As far as servers go, we weren't disappointed.  Yeah, I know. Yet another popular local establishment that seems to have somehow eluded me. Maybe it's not them. Maybe I'm just getting lamer as I grow older. Maybe I'm destined to be that old guy scowling at the kids playing in the street, hoarding my collection of confiscated frisbees and footballs. I'm not writing off PSC after our visit. Perhaps they're worth another shot. Perhaps I'll get the burger next time. Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps."}
{"text":"When you walk into Prosperity Social Club, you might almost feel transported into a prohibition era cool-cat hangout. Your eyes might start to scan for the piano player playing some slow melodic tune, some cool joes sitting at the corner of the aged wood bar sipping on whiskey or Jin. You might start to wonder about their bootlegger tunnels housing some precious barrels. Then you realize this is 2011 & you are at the edge of the swanky Tremont restaurant row.  Prosperity Social Club, has successfully maintained it's old time charm with updated tasty food, beer, hard cider, and wines. Their menu is surprisingly diverse for a joint like this, with appetizers, sandwiches, salads, burgers and dessert. If you just want to drink you will find several great drinks. If you want food along with that drink, there are more than a few items that leave you wanting more. The Greek salad is piled high with with fresh ingredients and a light vinaigrette dressing, the Ed's Pita Nachos with red pepper aioli, kalamata olives, and diced cucumber garnish are finger licking tasty crunchy good, the C-Town Sausage sandwich with andouille sausage patty & roasted banana peppers is deceivingly mouth watering and bursting with flavor. Their sweet potato fries are no flimsy soggy thin cut strings of sweet potato instead, they are thick cut 5\" long slightly breaded semi fried. All of this taste with price range between $4 to $12.  The bartender, wait staff, as well as kitchen staff evidently take pride in this place & it shows in their layback and helpful attitude. During my visit, several patrons seemed regular whom were known by the staff on first name basis. There was a sense of calm & none of the pressure of hovering wait staff to get you out as soon as you are finished. In fact, we were told to spend as much time as we wanted between our orders. The back room has old fashioned bar games as well as a pool table. I can definitely understand why this place is a hit, casual, no pressure hang-out for many."}
{"text":"Mac and cheese is to die for! You can pick from a variety of ingredients to add in. The patio is filled with colorful chairs and tables and picnic benches. Classic Tremont spot!"}
{"text":"They have a pretty good happy hour, low key atmosphere, and interesting decor. The bartenders are friendly and know alot about beer. The food is awesome as well. I recommend the rueben on potato cakes, hummus plate, and the gouda burger."}
{"text":"Stopped for a nightcap with friends and family and to get something small to eat. Must try the Mac and cheese was very delicious."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Staff can be a little curt sometimes so that's why 4/5.  Food is delicious and I love the cozy setting."}
{"text":"This place is what Cleveland is all about. A little grungy on the outside, of the beaten path and a little outdated, but damn if it's not a gem once you take a look inside.   First off, the warm vibe when you walk in hits you like a ton of bricks. This place has seen a lot of Clevelanders come and go. If only those walls could talk. It's got tons of antique-y beer signage and decor that you know hasn't changed in years. It just brings you that rustbelt comfort through and through. There's even a wood-burning oven to cuddle up next to and a backroom with old fashion bar games, none of that video game stuff.   The service definitely matched the vibe--warm, friendly, welcoming and fantastic. The bartender suggested a delicious cider for me and gave us adequate time to chill out before getting our food order. I love that. You'll know when I'm in a rush to grab a bite to eat. For the most part, I'm there to enjoy a nice, relaxing meal that I'm just too lazy to make at home. Well, that and have a few cold ones. Oh, and $3 drafts on Monday? Great. But $3 drafts of really good beers, not the cheap stuff? Prosperity, you get my vote!  I've heard the food was good here, but I had no idea that ordering something as simple as a greek salad would be that damn good! The vinaigrette was perfect, not too oily. Lots of feta, kalamata olives and the grilled chicken actually tasted fantastic! How many times have you ordered a salad at a bar and actually enjoyed it? I can tell you when I have: Prosperity! We also split the portobella mushroom sandwich with sweet potato fries. Whatever they marinated that cap in was delicious and sweet potato fries that aren't soggy? Wow... I was impressed!  There were people walking in and out of this bar the whole time we were there and it didn't appear to be letting up. Not too crowded, everyone was chill and the beers were flowing. I couldn't recommend this place more for a relaxing evening out and a quick bite to eat. Definitely my kind of place."}
{"text":"Great food. Great local brews in a very classic old school Cleveland bar. The Lenten menu is bar none the best in the area. If you are from outta town the Tremont area has great stops and Prosperity is must stop."}
{"text":"I'm gonna add this to my Cleveland breakfast/brunch circuit.  Firstly before I get into the food, I want to talk about the premium top notch service. Every single employee I've interacted with has been polite, outgoing, helpful, interesting, and engaging. They were also very on top of your standard server duties too, obviously. Keep it up, we notice it! You can tell they're a fun crew.  I had some delicious toasted pancakes with herbed scrambled eggs. The pancakes had delicious cranberries and fruit on top, perfect sweet breakfast to pair with my protein.  The OJ I could tell may have been the concentrate stuff, I think theres room for an upgrade there in my opinion. Taste kind of reminds you of growing up and Mom buying the cheap stuff to make ends meet, lol.  My buddy really enjoyed his biscuits and gravy.  All in all, very positive experience!"}
{"text":"I have to defend the PSP....I'm a Cleveland girl in Chicago and this is the one place I make sure to visit every time I'm home.  The food IS good.  The service is great.  I was sad to see the bratwurst go...But I've already voiced my concerns.  Whenever I get nostalgic for the Cleve, I think about bowling and Scrabble in the back room.  There aren't enough hipsters in Cleveland to overrun any bar, especially this one.  It's too lovely and clean and delicious and wonderful."}
{"text":"Excellent food, atmosphere, beer list. Great place for classics - burger and fries. Fish fry - great selection and not sitting in grease. Beers - awesome craft list. Seating is tight (what place in tremont isn't) and street parking."}
{"text":"We stopped in and left shortly thereafter. No fault of theirs we didn't really want brunch. I will say the Bloody Mary was excellent as well as the service. We will go back for dinner sometime."}
{"text":"I love everything that Prosperity has to offer - board games, good beer prices, and friends - What more could you need for a relaxing evening?   Also, once a month, they have Karaoke!"}
{"text":"We have been to Prosperity Social Club on several occasions and have always enjoyed the food and have had good service. That is until last night.  We actually brought 2 couples with us for dinner that had never been there. Thought it would be fun. We were very wrong. Our dinners took forever to be served; in fact the table of 4 next to us (who were seated after we were) were served their meals about 15 minutes before ours. When I asked our server if there was a problem with our dinners, she told us they were very busy. The manager then came over and asked if we needed help. I asked her also if there was an issue with our meals. She told me everything \"was fine\". There was no problem.  Our meals eventually were served. Needless to say, we were embarrassed after having recommended this place. Not only was the service extremely poor, the server and the manager were just as rude. Don't think we'll be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"A place I would take my parents to. . .actually, I have gone with my in-laws and it was a really great time. Let's do it again, both sides of the family though, why not?  Get the Wyder's Pear Cider, they always have on draft. Or the Bell's Oberon (it's that time of year again).  The food is delightful - a variety of \"American Classics\" (burgers, fish fry, pierogies, etc.) but also many vegetarian options (hummos, veggie empanadas, and grilled portabella burgers).  Just adore this place. Your parents will too ;)"}
{"text":"I loved our visit to this restaurant. The weather was wonderful so we sat in the back patio. The beer was good. My husband had the steak special and was very happy with his choice. Before we left we played a few games on the vintage bowling machine. Perfect evening!"}
{"text":"FRIDAY LUNCH!  What a pleasant surprise to drive by this great place and see that they are dipping their toe in the lunchtime water with lunch specials on Friday. It's too bad that my party of four ate in a nearly empty room because the food, service and ambiance was excellent. I'm not going to rehash each dish, just go and be more than satisfied with this Cleveland gem."}
{"text":"I had polish breakfast with herb scrambled eggs, kielbasa, perogies and potatoes. And a eggs florentine for Sue. All good and tasty. Somewhat high priced. Service good. Will come back again. They serve alcohol too and k took advantage of a Bloody Mary.  Nice decor with a heritage Cleveland theme. The pics will show that a bit."}
{"text":"I was a bit skeptical of this place.  Not sure why?  Pretty F'n Good. My rather large buddy got the vegetarian empanadas. They were F'N good. They had cheese so at least they were not vegan. I'm pretty much getting tired of vegans and their miss informed opinions.  Next, someone else got the sausage platter and mashers. Looked so good I had to get it. Got it, but with bok choy instead of mashed potatoes. It worked but was strange. The sausage and kraut combo was perfect. All the sausage goodness, plus kraut bite, bok choy crunchy, but no food coma afterward.  Wonderful. But unless your like me get the high carb side that is supposed to come with it. Saw a burger come out of the kitchen, it looooked sooo good, the dude who was smashing it down had a look of ecstasy in his eyes.  Someone ordered the latkas, but she had to leave before eating : ). They looked well prepared.   Drinks- they have PBR on the menu as well as other high end beers that are triple the $. That says to me that you can drink well or cheap. That is why this place so rocks.  OK so I am writing a great review, why you may ask, have I not given 5 stars. I came in with 5 people. We ordered drinks from the bar. They advised that we needed a table and server if we wanted a table.  We were not sure about the WHOLE situation and the service seemed aggravated. Now I have been a server in the most affluent times of the  Cleveland dinning scene, and never copped that much of a tude. So the folks behind the bar were grumbling, I kind of heard some  bitching and moaning. Anyhow, once they saw our group was not just into drinking cheap beers, except me, the service improved.  So Prosperity, don't judge a tip by a cover because you can't, some of the time ; )"}
{"text":"I have been here 4 times and it has always been awesome. I like the laid back environment and the food is really good. The bartenders are always very nice and attentive. I seriously recommend the Pama Paloma and the fried chicken."}
{"text":"Prosperity Social Club is a clever update of a retro Polish social club. Clever, in that the only aspect of the joint that actually seems updated is the menu, while the bar itself seems to have been perfectly preserved in time. I lived in Cleveland in the 80s and 90s for a dozen years, and I never saw any bar or restaurant that screams Cleveland more than this gem.  Our party of four was there for brunch, and all of us were impressed with the straight-from-the-70s beer hall decor, as well as with the innovative menu that featured such delicious items as biscuits & gravy & fried chicken; polish breakfast with scrambled eggs, kielbasa, & pierogies; and the C-Town Sausage sandwich with andouille sausage & roasted banana peppers.  A full bar was available and we partook of the piquant and spicy bloody Marys along side our coffees.    Service was impeccable, and the only thing that kept our experience from being five star was the annoyingly blase couple who let their twin toddlers have the run of the place with almost no supervision.  I love kids, but toddlers do not belong in bars, especially if their parents aren't looking after them."}
{"text":"This place is the bees knees. Love the food, love the patio ( Us smokers LOOOVE patios) and the staff is always friendly and super. This place makes me look cool when I bring other people there  Keep it up!"}
{"text":"This is going to be super trite, but my feelings for Prosperity are thick, gooey and warm like a freshly baked Ã©clair.  That whole \"Cheers\" adage about a place where everybody knows your name and is glad you came? That's this place.  I've been visiting Prosperity for a good 5 years now- basically since its opening. The staff has always been nothing but terrific, the atmosphere laid back and epitomizing of oldschool Cleveland, the food hearty, tasty and affordable. The jukebox has clearly held the title of \"best bar jukebox\" in all the land for years now.  Its a super versatile space, catering to the likes of many and serves as my go-to bar when I have out of town visitors. I've taken my parents there for dinner, and when I just want to get a drink solo on a weeknight, my car is basically set on autopilot to head there.  I've held functions and events at Prosperity as well- Bonnie, the owner is willing to work with folks and extremely amiable and positive. The space is a good size, and has entertainment options like a pool table, a bowling machine, and board games. When the weather cooperates, they have my favorite patio in town. The bathrooms are clean and even charming!  As far as wheelchair accessibility, if you let a bartender know, they can open the fence in back and let someone in a chair through the back door.  I can't say enough good things about it, really & truly. This is one of Cleveland's gems."}
{"text":"So the one star is for my food experience alone, I would give it 4-5 stars for anything else.  I heard really good things about their steak night so I went for it.  My friend ordered her steak well done, I got mine medium-rare.  Got the steak, everything looked good, took a bite, and it was tough and chewy as hell!  I kept at it hope it would get better, but just ended up spitting it all out.  Her steak was more manageable, and I'm thinking maybe because it's not great quality meat, it needed to be cooked more.  In any case, I realize this is not a steak joint and I do love this place anyway! I will not be ordering the steak again, and if you do just get it well done."}
{"text":"Headed to Prosperity on a Friday night for dinner and drinks. I hadn't heard much about Prosperity, so didn't really have any expectations going in. Unfortunately, I probably won't be going back.  PROS -Casual atmosphere. The place reminded me of a home basement with a built in bar. Wasn't fancy, so no need to dress up.   -Grey Gardens. I was a big fan of this drink. I've had similar tasting drinks to this, but I thought the vanilla vodka was a nice touch.  CONS -Flavorless food. I got the fried chicken dinner as my main course. The chicken was bland, the mac and cheese was bland. The collards were okay, but when the greens are the best thing on a plate of comfort food, that's not saying much. -Slow service. I try to take into account a lot of things when I put service in the 'cons' list (business of restaurant, number of waiters, etc). The restaurant was not full and at one point, I saw at least 4 people working/standing behind the bar. It took forever for our appetizer and equally as long for our entrees. My fiancÃ© had to go up to the bar to get another drink for me, because no one was coming by our table. There was just no sense of urgency or hospitality. -Price. For 3 drinks, an appetizer, and two entrees, our total was $73, pre-tip. For the quality of our food and service, I thought this was outrageous.  BOTTOM LINE -Everything was underwhelming."}
{"text":"Was totally happy with my 1st time here.  Parking was a little hard... Drove around the block a couple times.    Walk in and greeted by bartender guy right away.  Told to sit wherever we wanted.  It was a Sunday about 5:30. A few tables taken.   The bar is upfront, we sat in the back by the bowling machine.  Bartender came right away w/menus.  He was super friendly the whole time, answered any and all questions about the food.    For starters, I did get the pear cider since a few people raved about it in here.  It was ok. My hubby didn't like it. I'm pretty sure it's an acquired taste thing.  I feel if I drank it miles often, I could see liking it.     Food lowdown: loaded pierogi app was good.  Server said they r made local by the old polish ladies.  The only thing is they were deep fried.  And I know it's quicker, but pan fried is still better.  They were potato filled w/cheddar and bacon on top w/onion straws and bacon aioli. Next time I will try the ricotta filled rogies.  The fried chix was spot on (oh heck yes, I taste all food at the table!).  Juicy too! The side of Mac n cheese was phenomenal! The sausage patty on a pretzel bun with fried egg and I think cheese and bacon was very good too!  A bit spicy, but really good and I don't usually like sausage.  Server said sausage patties made local too.   While we waited for food, we played boggle, one of the games they had on a shelf for customers to play... The games were missing the timer, but one in the cell worked out perfect, the server saw we were going to play and asked if we wanted paper and pens and brought them over.  We didn't really know all the rules, but we made our own and it was fun!    It was cozy and comfortable hanging out there and getting some good local food!  This place has now been added to our list of go to places!"}
{"text":"On a recent trip to Prosperity Social Club, I discovered Anchor Steam Beer.... on Draft! As a beer snob, I liken this finding to Indiana Jones discovering the Holy Grail.   \"Why, tell us more about this mysterious steam beer,\" you say!?   Originated out of necessity in the late 1800's, this Californian beer was fermented at high temperatures without refrigeration. With no way to effectively cool the boiling wort, it was poured into large, shallow, open-top bins and chilled with nothing more than the cool air blowing off the Pacific Ocean.   In the world of beer, most brews fall into two categories: Ales or Lagers. Ales are top-fermenting with yeasts kept at 55Â°-75Â°F. Lagers are bottom fermenting with yeasts at 32Â°-55Â°F  Steam Beer uses bottom fermenting lager yeasts at ale temperatures, which results in a very distinctive flavor profile that includes both ale and lager characteristics.  If God made beer, it would taste exactly like this.  A refreshing pour of deep amber with a thick creamy head; it's a rich, but drinkable crafted brew. Anchor Steam Beer, I adore thee. And thank you Prosperity Social Club for offering this Godsend!"}
{"text":"Good food, good service, and good happy hour specials. But nothing that special.  ---  I came with a friend for happy hour since we were looking for somewhere relatively inexpensive to grab a few drinks and some food after work in Tremont. When we got there around 5:30pm, we were pretty much the only ones around and service was correspondingly prompt.  I ordered the blackened tilapia BLT on herbed focaccia, which I'd highly recommend. The accompanying fries were surprisingly good as well. My friend ordered mussels and said they were good as well. Based on admittedly limited experience, I'd give four stars for the food: nothing fancy, but solid.  Beer selection was limited, but the choices were solid and happy hour prices were good. Whiskey, though, was overpriced: $12.50 for a pour of Blanton's? Ordered on the rocks and got more ice than whiskey, which was profoundly disappointing.  Perhaps I'm being overly harsh on Prosperity, but after seeing all the five star reviews here, I went in with high expectations and was underwhelmed."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Come here for brunch-especially on the patio.  Drinks-Order the Rustbelt Shandy.  Macaroni & cheese-it's really good on it's own, but if you want to make it a meal get something like chorizo added to it. Everything is decently priced, nothing over the top like some of these places in Tremont."}
{"text":"I had heard great things about prosperity social club, so when a large group(about 15) of friends of mine wanted to get together for some drinks, i recommended we try someplace new! Everyone was excited! We got there, and it was pretty slow, maybe 6 tables.... we saw one bartender pouring drinks behind the bar and the place looked like fun! Being a big group we tried to pick out where we'd fit best and where we wouldn't be too loud and obnoxious for others or in the way, so we headed towards some tables in the back and began to pull tables together.  we were quickly approached by someone who worked there and he asked us to step back and he'd do that for us. normally, i'd say \"sure, thanks!\" but in this case, he was extremely rude and even mumbled that WE were f***in disrespectful. I was confused as to what we did wrong...  Then he gave us an attitude the rest of the night. I would've normally walked out, but the weather was terrible and it was hard enough to get everyone parked and in the bar so we decided to stay. The drinks and the food were fine.... but this is definitely a case where the bad service ruined it completely. I wont be back."}
{"text":"Food's fine (although I've only really had the burgers), service is friendly, and you can smoke out on the patio. If you forget your lighter, they don't have matches, but a server let me use a grill lighter that momentarily made me feel like a Greek shipping magnate.   They have a hefty selection of board games as well -- although if you're on a first date, I wouldn't recommend getting drunk and being boastful about your Connect Four skills."}
{"text":"Had an excellent dinner here last night!  We had been here once before and the food was under seasoned, but I'm so glad we gave it another shot.  We started out with the pita nachos which were quite tasty and I had the veggie curry for my main dish and it was great.  The server was wonderful.  Prosperity has a good beer list and a really laid back, cool, divey type of vibe.  It's very Cleveland."}
{"text":"\"Great Wisconsin kind of hang out. Looks like your parents basement with the old bar and crazy collected stuff all over.\" This was the description from a dear college MU (who is from WI) when she asked if I wanted to go here with our friends from MU, who were in town of the weekend, well of course I said we had to go. And the description fits perfectly. The food was very good, I had the Hungarian Stuffed Cabbage, on the reco from our server. She did not stare me wrong. The other dishes at the table were the pork empanadas, shrimp piccata pasta, and sunshine citrus chicken salad, all went over well with everyone. The beer choices were perfect, they had they old time beers of the 70's i.e. Strohs, PBR and some great local IPAs. Our highlight of the evening was the classic old bowling machine which seemed to have a mind of its own. The kind with the sold marble balls, you can choose several games to play. Well we played, but never know what game we were actually playing, and the scoring seemed to be random!!! But it was a total blast!!! The service was very good and everyone was very friendly. A great place to bring close friends or family to relax with good drinks, food, and games!!"}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour...very friendly people when i was in here...  Hipster free.  My daughter and i had an awesome time!"}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to have dinner at Prosperity Social Club before the last Tremont Art Walk.  Swanky, it ain't, but this low key, down to earth bar/restaurant seems like a cool place to hang out.  (Any place with a disco ball is ok by me.)  I had a starter salad which was ok - nothing fancy, just some iceberg and apples.  My entree was really good, though.  I had the vegetarian veggie empanadas.  They were really flavorful and fresh.  My dining companions had the potato pancakes which were huge and the seafood special of the day.  They both really liked their meals.  This place is sort of off the beaten path in Tremont, but it's definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Went for the fish fry and got bar seats . It gets super packed in there and the seats are right on top of each other . Make reservations if you're going on a Friday night. The bartender wasn't impressed with how I was just drinking instead of eating. Kinda felt like they wanted us out of there to get more people in . The home made potato chip app was fantastic. The fish was good too . My girlfriend didn't the like the Mac and Cheese but I did so you decide . Perogies were so so so good. It's a little pricey but well worth it if you're hungry."}
{"text":"Average brunch, but the nice thing is that there isn't a wait. It's pretty standard, I got the standard brunch: two eggs with potatoes and an English muffin. The herb scrambled potatoes were pretty tasty, I honestly really enjoyed it. I don't think I'd come back but I did like all the holiday decor and it's a dependable place."}
{"text":"Came here after my flight got delayed 5 hours. Everyone was really friendly and service was pretty quick too. I'm not sure what it was called but we split a burger that had mushrooms and fried onions on it. IT WAS AMAZING. They also have this really cool old school bowling game. I would def recommend this place."}
{"text":"Walk in and you'll assume you walked into the basement of a steel worker in 1972--there's even Springsteen and Waits on the jukebox to complete the feel. But the wood paneling and old school beer neons belie the great beer list and even better food. Everything I've had here has been great--from the burgers to the shrimp & grits to the salads to the tacos. And the staff is super friendly--we have a two year old and they treat him like a neighborhood kid that they've known forever. So whatever part of like you're in and as long as you like good food and cheap beer prices, this place is for you."}
{"text":"There is nothing negative to be said about Prosperity Social Club, a bucolic, infinitely cozy little titan, which--as the name would imply--sits perfeclty knitted in the fabric of Tremont as a hallmark of greatest riches.  Food: Homestyle goodness with Polish/Hungarian flavors and an emphasis on comfort food. Try the fabulous fried chicken dinner--perfectly prepared without that foul greasy retinue that accompanies lesser-cooked birds--with greens and PSC's signature mac and cheese. It is a plate of pure Southern-style heaven. The perogies are also divine. My favorite dish, however, is probably the so-called 'Killer' Gouda Burger, with its mound of perfectly seasoned onion rings and secret spicy sauce. A savory treat for any occasion. Those searching for lighter fare would do well with the Cobb Salad, which, while gargantuan, is packed full of veggies absent from the majority of the menu. The beer list is quite large and diverse as well, with seasonal favorites available on draft all year round.   N.B. Prosperity is now open for brunch on Saturdays and Sundays and has already been short-listed as one of the best brunch spots in CLE. With good reason. The breakfast Empanadas are grandly plated with whorls of soft, warm cheese and sauteed peppers, and each dissolves in your mouth with a most excellent blend of meaty goodness and southwestern spice.   Atmosphere: Akin to dining in your grandpa's attic, though a cleanlier version, most likely. Nostalgia abounds. PSC used to be a Polish club and the wood-paneled walls and pool hall vibe give the patron a glimpse of a hard-working, hard-drinking land that time forgot. The walls are adorned with dozens of antique beer signs (Shlitz and High Life and so forth) and sometimes old movies are playing on the mini-TV above the bar. This is what a bar ought to be, one patron exclaimed upon a recent visit, old-fashioned and charming and clean.   Staff: Some of the friendliest, most accomodating people you're likely to ever meet. Expect to be greeted with smiles and well wishes. You can tell there is a familial-like allegiance at play among the staff that a lot of bars lack. These generous people give themselves over to their duties with heroic intensity. They prepare rich and strong drinks with workman-like aplomb: nothing flashy, nothing out of line with the dictums of the decor--good food, good cheer, nothing ostentatious.   Closing: It works. All of it. This place is a Tremont staple and well-worth a visit for anyone interested in just what the roots of Cleveland look like--not withered in the light as this rusty city ages, but fine-tethered, strong, and more ready than ever to provide for you."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food, great staff and great clientele. The interior reminds me of a typical neighborhood dive bar and that's part of the appeal."}
{"text":"I really, really like it here. It's Tremont, but not the tiresome hipster Tremont. The ambiance is unbeatable, the service and crowd are friendly and warm, and food and beverages hit my sweet spots. My crowd had the potato pancakes accompanied by a fruit chutney, cheeseburgers, and the chorizo sandwich, all very good. Great selection of beers on tap, too.  The night we were here, there was a fundraiser for a certain councilman, who shall remain nameless to protect his identity. The wonderful pear cider had been replaced for the event, which was a major bummer (I'm guessing they replaced it with Bud Lite or something equally gross, but I didn't want to ask for fear it would make me even angrier). AND they were gathering in the back room and preventing access to the bowling machine! So we had to go to Major Hoopples for some bar bowling after dinner, but that's another review...  Long story short, I'd definitely go back for the food. And bar bowling."}
{"text":"This place appears to be a hipster oasis. They do not stock bud light or any other Anheuser-Busch product. I often feel like I am being judged by many of the patrons.  The decorations are extremely dated and appear to have been there for many years. The bathrooms are small and service is slow. I go there regularly."}
{"text":"I like the setting and feel of this place. The food was fantastic, but the service was horrible. The server called my brother lazy because he asked where the men's restroom was. I asked for a water and the server told me that I can get my water from another table instead of bringing me one. Also do not order a Bloody Mary. The worst Bloody Mary I have had in my life."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Relaxed atmosphere, ethnic influence, neighborhood feel, and good food. Always leave this place feeling satisfied."}
{"text":"i love this place....a great neighborhood dive! atmosphere is of the old neighborhood joints your grandfather and his working buddies might have visited to cash their friday paychecks and have a few shots with beer chasers! decor is dark and has flashes of old advertising signs, lights and neon.....outside patio feels like a college buddy's backyard with picnic tables, xmas lights and old vintage style metal patio chairs.  the menu is ecclectic, offering a bit of everything for everybody. the burgers are awesome!!! so are the homemade potato chips, the mussles, mac & cheese and empanadas! so happy to have found this place, it's a great littly dive-y hang out with old school charm and a modern day appeal!!!"}
{"text":"The absolute worst dining experience of the decade!  My pierogi's were dryer than the Sahara Desert and were served with a tiny plastic cup of mayonnaise that had a brownish  tinge around the edges.  I tasted it and worried that I had just given myself a case of food poisoning!  Who puts mayonnaise on pierogi's?  I asked for sour cream and was brought a teaspoonful in a tiny plastic cup.  Really?  My husband ordered a Reuben sandwich which was terrible and came with a potato pancake that was so burnt that it was pitch black!  I felt like asking for a refund and stopping off at McDonald's for two fish sandwiches for $4.00!  I give you ZERO stars for a truly hideous gastronomic experience and will definitely NEVER return!"}
{"text":"I have not had the food, except that once I had a piece of cheesecake there and it was perfectly tasty.  I have had the drinks, from wine to a fancy bailey's-ish dessert drink, and they were excellent.   And I have seen the delightfully laid back vintage-midwest decor, and experienced the mellow, spacious vibe. Heard the good music they play (an entire Arcade Fire album the last time I was in there) and the wacky old movies that are on (Butterlies Are Free.) Been recipient of the friendly service. Marvelled at the size of the place--that just couldn't happen in San Francisco.  Great bar that makes me miss the Midwest."}
{"text":"Brunch is excellent!  The polish breakfast is a lot of food but great.  Mac n cheese special was delicious.    Get the blood orange mimosa."}
{"text":"I like this place, but it's just so awkward when you first walk in.  There's no music playing, it's so quiet, and the four other people in there that are sitting at the bar + the bartender just look over and stare at you until you sit down.  I'm all for hole in the walls, but I wish they would do a little fixing up-maybe repolish the bar at least or something, to make it feel a little bit cleaner in there.    The beer selection is ok.  I did order something they had on some kind of special--it was something like miller and orange juice? It was just too warm for me.  Didn't care for it.  I ordered the andouille nachos as my main course and OMG so good.  Another time I went there and got them they weren't as good as I remembered, but they were much better than traditional nachos other places serve you--which is usually half a bag of chips and very little toppings.  That's definitely not what these nachos are like.   I introduced this place to one of my girlfriends that's a vegetarian.  She loved this place because there were so many options for her, which she is normally not used to. I think that definitely give this place an extra plus. I think this is a good place to go with a group of people where you just want to keep things low key."}
{"text":"Prosperity is cool because you can go there with friends and talk without yelling over music or TVs.   A modern, broad selection of beers, ciders, and drinks with about 6 beers on draft. Excellent bread pudding.   The atmosphere is consistently old school. They typically play Turner Classic Movies on tube TVs with no sound. Beer advertising tchotchkes from the 40s or 50s.   Karaoke night is fun - though some take it a little serious - But it's all good.   A good place to relax and have a beer."}
{"text":"I picked this bar for my girls night-out because I had been there and I had had a good experience having a friendly bartender there before, but I had not had their food. I regret to have chosen this bar now. First of all, my ladies and I had a rude server. Secondary, their food was not good. I asked the server to take our second round order to share because it was getting close to the end of their happy hour. The server did not take it soon and came back to our table after several minutes, and said that their happy hour was over. I said to him that I had asked him to take our orders before that, then he said \"What time is it now, ma'am?\" I checked my phone, and it was 7:01 p.m. I have never ever been treated like that!! It was so upsetting. For food, we had a couple servings of raw fried chicken, which we had to send back, cold wings, just okay meat empanadas, mediocre chicken tacos and tasteless pierogis. For pierogis, we ordered a few servings without being asked what kind we wanted. Eventually, we found out that they were all ricotta filled ones. They were not good at all, so I could not finish even one piece. I have read one review telling their bad server. I believe that I had the same one. Good food might be able to cover the bad service, but it can never happen at this place."}
{"text":"Came in around 2 on a Friday for their fish fry which I've heard is excellent- ended up getting a southwest shrimp salad which was amazing! I sat at the bar and was helped by the very friendly bartender Juan. Apparently it's been a bar since the 1930s which is pretty cool- I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"It's places like this that make you want to live in Tremont.  First off it was a cold, rainy night, I was starving and really wanted a beer.  I decided earlier in the day I wanted to try something new but with a laid back, relaxing kind of feel.  I couldn't have been more happy with my experience at Prosperity's last night.  I already checked out the photos on their website and on yelp, along with the appetizer menu, so I knew what I was getting myself into.  I had my eyes on the 2 dozen mussels for $8.50 and the Pierogies for the same.  My partner in crime decided on the Hummus.  And of course no experience would be complete without trying their rotating seasonal.  I know this was going to be a 4 star place the minute I noticed the Bells Brown they had on tap, one of my favorite beers from Bells Brewery in Kalamazoo Michigan.  Service was great.  Cute, timid bartender was all over our every need.  Beer was always full and the food was piping hot when it came out, not heat lamp hot either.  The mussels were simple but delicious.  Not a single one cracked, empty, or still closed.  One of the only places I've been to that can get that right.  The pierogies were very good.  I never had ricotta filled ones but it added a little sweetness that went well with the butter soaked onions and sour cream.   Finally I have to say I am a hater of chick peas, too dry and not much taste, and this hatred kind of followed in line with hummus.  I've tried it at different places and just was not a fan.  But the trooper that I am, gave the PSC hummus a try and actually went back for more.  Smoother then all other hummus I had and they mix in fresh herbs with good olive oil that came through in the taste.  The pita crisps are actually crisp and not impossible to spread the hummus on.  Also came with cucumbers, kalamata olives, and tomatoes.    About the bar.  Long bar, pool table, old school bowling game, small bathrooms, great jukebox (put $5 in when we got there), but the thing that stands out is the decor.  Antique, full working condition, Schlitz globes were the star attraction.  I also liked the fact that they had a disco ball going at all times, with a little Saturday Night Fever from the jukebox it just sets the scene for a party ready to break loose.  Unfortunately, we only got some head bobs to George Clinton and Ice Cube's hardly ever played 1993 hit Bop Gun.  How fun.  I will definitely go back.  It might not be right away only because there are so many restaurants I want to try in the area.  I may come back and adjust my rating once I know what I'm comparing to in close vicinity but my first intuition is to make Prosperity a 5 but we'll see.  FYI - I took a picture of their Happy Hour menu but am having a problem downloading it but will keep trying.  You can always go to their website though.  They also have all day specials, Thursday was a $10 Strip Steak and Fries, good deal if I've ever heard of one."}
{"text":"Great brunch spot! I went here last week and it was pretty delicious and affordable for the amount of food that I got. Staff is super welcoming and hard-working."}
{"text":"Eh can't say I'm sold on this place from my first experience. We went with a big group and had a good time socializing, so their name succeeds there, but the rest was just nothing to rave about. We did have a blast playing trivial pursuit and shooting pool. As far as food and drinks, good beer selection and the menu has some ethnic fare. He got loaded fries and I had an appetizer of tacos and a few drinks and a shot for the birthday boy we were at $100...not the kind of place we go when planning on dropping a Benjamin. Overall it was okay but can't say we will seek it out for next time."}
{"text":"Came in and wasn't impressed but a regular begged me to stay and said he wanted me to experience this place. I thought that was cool....the people were nice...they had OYO Vodka....and games. The locals were awesome and directed us to another great location. Would visit again."}
{"text":"If you like sub-par food and lousy service, this is the place for you.  The one redeeming quality is that there is a great beer list.  Pick the one that you really want first, though, because that's the only one you will get.  I would love to tell you about the desserts, but our server refused to take a dessert order from all but one person at our table.  I realize that the A-team probably isn't working on Monday night, but the lack of activity in the restaurant should have at least provided our server the opportunity to pay at least minimal attention to our small group.  There are far too many exceptional restaurants in Tremont to waste your time, your energy, or your money at Prosperity."}
{"text":"My fiancÃ© and I were in Cleveland from Buffalo and didn't know where to have breakfast on a Saturday... I originally searched \"greasy spoon;\" Prosperity Social didn't come up in the search but we drove by and decided to give it a whirl, we're so glad we did. We were able to sit at the bar right away, our server(s) couldn't have been nicer. He got the Polish breakfast, I got the biscuits and gravy and both were delicious! The Bloody Marys were great too. Next time we're in Cleveland we'll definitely stop back."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Great food! Great beer! Great cocktails! Great beer-cocktails!!! Great service! Ski ball!!! BOOM! It's like having gourmet comfort food in your grandpas basement bar. Favorite spot to visit when I'm in town. I can't rave about it enough."}
{"text":"Stepping into Prosperity Social Club is like stepping back in time. The decor of the bar reminds me of a place my grandparents would have frequented in the 1950s. The food is phenomenal. I think they have the best burgers in the area. Everything is very fresh and homemade. The main dishes change frequently. Be sure to ask about the specials. The severs here are fantastic. They always remember me and what I like to order. Prosperity is a great dinner spot!"}
{"text":"Decided to come here for brunch one Sunday afternoon with my best friend. I've always seen their instagram posts about specials that they have. I was so excited to try the food based on pictures I've seen. My friend and I both ordered the biscuits and gravy. I was disappointed with the lack of flavor in the gravy and the meat. There was hardly any meat in the dish and it required quite a bit of salt  and pepper. The customer service was great though, no complaints there. I will come back around lunch or dinner and give it another try."}
{"text":"Can here for brunch with a large group. I got the Eggs Blackstone (basically Eggs Benedict with bacon) with avocado and a mango mimosa. I was expecting the mimosa to be a little sweeter. The poached eggs were good, the hollandaise sauce was not enough and the bacon was a little dry. Also would've like a little more avocado. The potato hash needed a little more seasoning, I would've liked the potatoes more crisp. They weren't soft or anything. Maybe their dinner is better. Next time I'm going to brunch I would go somewhere else though. I definitely expect a very hearty, flavorful, I'm-going-to-get-heart-disease-or-hypertension type of brunch."}
{"text":"I really think Prosperity is as good as it gets. It nails everything I want. The food was GREAT. Potato Pancake Ruben and Mac'n'Cheese -- can't forget about the stuffed hot peppers. The food was all fantastic. It's a very homey environment. Service was spot on -- we started to consume alcohol at a pretty rapid rate and they were able to keep up with us. I cannot wait to go back and try everything on their menu.   They also have board games and shuffle board or something in the back --- next time trying that for sure! Great experience, love the decor and ambiance, food = excellent. Plus, for 1 app, 2 entrees, and 8-10 drinks it was under 100 bucks with tip!"}
{"text":"This is an interesting spot!! My first visit and this is Old School.....I love it!!  Im gonna come back and try the Weekend Brunch."}
{"text":"Seen this place had good reviews so had to check it out. If your going for looks or modern you won't find it here. But if your going for good food then check it out. Ruben between two potato pancakes is a must try. I wasn't impressed by the chicken tacos even at the happy hour price. Their French fries are like carnival fries very yummy. They have different meals available for discounted price depending the day of the week the day we went it was steak which was also really good. Don't be turned off by the old school vibe their going for because the food was worth it."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I love to look around at all the random shit on the walls.  The food is fantastic and most everyone there is friendly.  Gimme a can o' blatz and a reuben and I'm a happy gal.  Oh, you know what makes me even happier?  The reuben made with potato pancakes instead of Rye Bread.  Holy fantastico.  I can cut it into quarters and make 4 meals out of it.  It'd still probably exceed any caloric limits one should have in a meal though.  Karaoke is fun and Wed $5 burgers are great, too.  Good place to have around the corner.  I shouldn't take it for granted."}
{"text":"Was in Cleveland for the weekend and found this place on yelp and we decided to try it out.   The place has a cool ambience, divey feel. The place was packed but the service and speed of our brunch was perfect.  The food for me was meh. I got the cheese pierogis and they were nothing to write home about. My boyfriend got the sausage sandwich on a pretzel bun and he loved it. He loves spicy stuff so this was perfect for his palate."}
{"text":"One of my favorite bars in Cleveland! There's so much to love about this place: I always end up meeting new, interesting people with crazy life trajectory type stories there. They have Wyder's Pear Cider on tap, which is really refreshing to drink on warm summer nights on their patio. The food is always delicious, and the happy hour specials are great. The cocktails that I've tried there are delicious and strong. Some of the male servers are ridiculously hot. Parking is abundant. It's all good!  It's just a really cool place! I really want to go to dinner there when they are doing their supper club night."}
{"text":"LOVE the food, you can never have enough. It is pricey, if you're going there to drink, there are much cheaper bars around but it is quality stuff. The staff can be a bit all over the place. You either have a great waitress one time and a terrible one the next. Its touch and go. I haven't had any problems except they don't change anything with your order, like you cant request for food changes to meet a dietary/allergy needs."}
{"text":"We went here to try their famous fish fry and it was great! It's beers battered haddock with a side of sweet potato fries.!i usually don't like a sweet potatoes but these fries were thick cut and seasoned well. The batter on the fish was delicious and nice and crispy. It's a very chill environment and a great place for kids."}
{"text":"Edisons is being destroyed by the spillover of yuppies who travel between the Treehouse and Flying Monkey. I rather sit at the bar alone, look at decorations, listen to music and think about life. I decided to give Lakewood another try. I grew up there, I love the community, and think it is a great place. The people that go to the bars in Lakewood are bothersome. It was pathetic and college-like in Lakewood tonight. Some of the girls looked good, but I would not want to subject myself to talking to them. I am sure they would not want to hear any words from my mouth either. I would rather sit at Prosperity, look at the rotating disco balls, think about the weather tomorrow and hope the clouds do not deflect the sun. It is supposed to be 70 degrees. I hope. Prosperity is gaining popularity with me. There were only 4 other people sitting at the bar. I enjoyed that. I like drinking by myself and this may be where I have to do it. They do not yet know me here. It is like Lord of the Rings 1. Once I reach the final battle of 3, I will move to another bar."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place. Based upon the Yelp reviews it seemed right up my alley.  The building is wonderful and the decorations are remarkable. They have a really remarkable collection of vintage Cleveland breweriana. Sitting at the bar, you feel as though you have entered a time warp and could be in any year after 1948. The wait staff was friendly and competent. The clientele was cheerful.  Unfortunately, the food was just not that good. The stuffed cabbage was unremarkable. The homemade potato chips seemed like they were two days old and tasted a little rancid. Just not delicious.  Short answer. Come to drink and hang out. Eat dinner somewhere else."}
{"text":"This place is what I imagine an old school true neighborhood bar looking and feeling like. Wood bar and wood panelling. Simple tables and simple to no decor. Tables and bar stools don't turn over that much. That said there was no wait for a table and we sat there chilling for three hours without preventing other people who were coming in from sitting right away. The staff was really friendly and welcoming.   For my first time here I went for brunch. The brunch menu really intrigued me. There were definitely uncommon dishes on the menu. Not just eggs done up in fancy ways, but truly unique foods that I haven't seen on brunch menus anywhere else. I ordered one of these, the Wake-up Call Empanadas. This dish was served on an oval plate covered in breakfast potatoes. On top of the potatoes was one decently sized empanada which was stuffed with andouille sausage, peppers, onions, cheddar cheese and egg. On top of the empanada and the potatoes was drilled a jalapeÃ±o-smoked cheddar sauce and tequila-lime salsa. All the flavors blended really well together. I expected the dish to be hotter/spicer than it was. It was definitely full of flavor, but not hot.   Bloody Mary's are good here as well. Those are actually on the spicy side. The menu says the mix is a house recipe.   I definitely want to try this place again and try another uncommon brunch dish - I have my eyes on the Polish Breakfast (Three potato pierogi, kielbaski, herbed scrambled eggs, bacon and smoked cheddar) and the C-Town Sausage Sandwich."}
{"text":"Visiting Cleveland for a weekend and saw this place had good brunch and wanted to give it a try!   My husband and I split the bananas foster pancakes and the breakfast empanadas! The breakfast empanadas were very good! Would highly recommend!   The pancakes were good too, just have had better other places!   Service was also great! Very nice server!"}
{"text":"Loved this place ! Amazing food ,Great stuffed cabbage and Pierogies. Looking forward to trying the rest of their food"}
{"text":"My friend and I had brunch here and we both loved it! Our drinks as well as the food were both so delicious and we'll definitely be back to try other items from the menu. What really impressed us was the outstanding service. The staff here is so nice too; they were constantly checking on us and more than one person asked about the food, drinks, etc. Definitely, one of the best experiences I've had when it comes to service. I really look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"A great spot to go at any point during the day. The brunch menu has all the classics with some extra spins. I highly recommend the tacos with tofu! They also have different flavored mimosas. At night it's a fun atmosphere with reasonably priced drinks and a friendly staff."}
{"text":"My favorite neighborhood bar in Cleveland.  Hams beer \"Ham & Cheese\" special, Tullamore Dew, great bartenders and atmosphere, great neighborhood, walking distance from tons of upscale or low-key restaurants and bars, short drive to a cooool tiki bar, the occasional band and good food.  WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT ???"}
{"text":"I've been to Prosperity a time or two, and have yet to be anywhere near disappointed.  The patio in the back is this place's bread and butter. It's hidden, but delightful. It reminds me of the 1950s (without the racial and gender inequality, of course) with its string lights, punchy red, yellow, green and baby blue metal chairs, water skis and tiki torches. To get a picture of the inside, imagine the bar you would expect Walter Mathau and Jack Lemmon to hang out in if they were playing two middle-classed, steel-working putzes. Now imagine that place playing The Decemberists, and presto! You're there.  The food has been tasty each time. The vegetarian curry is the bomb.com (i'm bringin it back) and spicy as all get out, like any good curry should be. And the potato pancakes are the bomb.de, for my friends in Germanland, topped with an apple chutney that's having my kids. The veggie empanadas and portobello sandwich are nothing to sneeze at, either.  Draft list is small, but respectable, with at least one thing to please everyone. Of the 5-6 handles they were pouring last time I imbibed were Guinness, Kentucky Bourbon Barrel, Heavy Seas IPA, and a pear cider. They also have a great bottle selection.  The servers have always been super nice, and quick to take orders, whether we were at the bar or out on the patio. To respond to fellow Yelper Judy G, as someone who's worked in the restaurant/bar industry, it is a little disrespectful to walk in with 15 people unannounced and start moving tables around like you own the place. Yes, it is a bar, and a laid-back one at that, but respect is a two-way street, ya dig?  Anywho, like I said, this place has never failed to tickle my fancy, and since it's a quick stroll down the street, I'll be back in a hot second."}
{"text":"Old blue collar Polish Social club bar/restaurant in Tremont of 80 years with history about fighter Jack Dempsey. So, old Cleveland. Really cool place. Takes reservations. Get there early because the place fills up. Even with a reservation you may wait. Had the signature cabbage rolls. Very good. Reuben with potato cakes as bread was heavy, but tasted very good. The fish fry was fantastic. Great beer selection. Patio in back. Reminds me of the same era as Parkview, an old blue collar bar/restaurant off Detroit."}
{"text":"Recently came here on a Saturday for brunch with a very large group of people. It was a top-notch experience from the beginning.   The restaurant was quick to accommodate everyone and speedy with the drink orders. The menu had a great selection of items as well. Sometimes, when you go to a brunch spot, it's the same type of stuff, or it's all really high-priced. Not here. There was something for everyone and the prices were very reasonable.  Our food amazingly all came out at the same time which, in my book, is a huge success for a kitchen serving a large group plus a whole dining room of other tables. And it was SO GOOD! Seriously, the breakfast was amazing. I had eggs blackstone (I think that was the name), a sort of hollandaise breakfast. Most placed drench the dish in hollandaise. Mine had just the right amount so that I didn't walk out clutching my chest like I'm about to have a heart attack.  So so good. Don't skip this place, especially if you're a Clevelander."}
{"text":"When you think of prosperity, you probably picture the good life, milk and honey, fortune, comfort, and a lavish bounty. I must say, the name suits this hidden gem in Tremont quite handsomely! Upon first glance you may question the dwelling... but fear not my companions... what awaits you inside is certain to put your mind at ease.  This being my first time in the joint, I was eager to take in all the sights. A rustic, feel good, old school vibe, with down to earth people sharing the passions of none other than great eats and tasty treats. It was the later part of the morning on a Sunday, so Brunch was definitely on my agenda. The options all sounded fantastic, but there was one in particular that just could not be reckoned with... Biscuits and Gravy. I mean. Can you ever really dislike a delicious pairing of this magnitude? Two eggs were atop the biscuits and gravy and served with a Potatoes O'Brien type of medley. A crispy potato with some peppers. The biscuits were super soft, the kind you could REALLY sink your teeth into... and the jam packed flavor of the gravy, not to mention the perfect consistency, made for a 5/5 dish. Eggs were cooked to my exact liking, over medium, with a sampling of melted cheese.   Now, keep in mind that I was willing to throw the full stars down on my plate alone, but a friend of mine made the ever so rewarding decision to add the fried chicken to his, and luckily for me, offered me a piece. Ummmmmm. This crunchy perfectly breaded piece of heaven was absolutely the cherry on the top of the cake. You guys... add the damn chicken. Incredibly worth it. While you're at it, go ahead and dunk it in this fantastic mango habanero sauce that they offer at the table - you know, the kind you're tempted to slip into your purse before leaving.  As if the meal and enjoyable company with a window sill view wasn't enough to make this experience a delight, our server Misty was truly exceptional and a hilarious addition to our meal. She was certainly entertaining, extremely on the ball with any and all requests, and very fun to banter with. She knew the menu well and added to the charm of this unique and delicious establishment. Until our next adventure, Prosperity... XoXo."}
{"text":"The perfect date spot.    Prosperity is fun because it's always low key, comfortable and warm.  Their fire is stoked during the winter and in the summer they have a very cool patio that makes me want to water-ski in the 6o's.    I especially like it because of it's great mix of good food, retro fun and board games!  They have all sorts of old games like battleship, Clue and Cleveland monopoly.  I don't recommend Cleveland Monopoly because it takes forever and people get super greedy when it comes to their favorite parts of town.  That, and last time I played, I was out first.  Thus, I hate that game.  Hate!  I've had plenty of their menu items.  I am always pleased!  Pleased as Sangria Punch!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed Sunday brunch. Empanadas were very good, Had a bite of the breakfast Mac & cheese which was excellent. Only downside- no kids menu or even something simple like a plain pancake and bacon that would be kid friendly."}
{"text":"What an amazing local pub and restaurant! I hope those who live nearby make this their local frequent stop. It has great food, amazing atmosphere and good beers on draft. I had the fish and chips which were good. I wish they had more cider options though."}
{"text":"Eh. I will probably catch some flack for this... but it's not my favorite place in CLE - or Tremont, for that matter. The outside is so amazing... but the inside is a dive. I love dive bars... but I mean - unless its the middle of the night, it just feels kind of dirty. The food is meh... fried things that aren't seasoned well. I hear the burgers are good - maybe I can update my review once I've tried them. The bar staff is super friendly and talkative... especially on a quiet weeknight during happy hour. The patio is really nice. I don't know. I have lots of friends who LOVE PSC. I'm not the biggest fan... but its a solid establishment and a fun time with the right people. Non pretentious and non hipster."}
{"text":"I have to write this special, specific review for Prosperity.  Steak Special on Thursdays!!!   It is awesome!  The steak, a petite sirloin, was cooked and seasoned perfectly, and served with thin cut frittes.  Really delicious,   Please! Please!  Whatever you do Prosperity, don't change this special!    Service was friendly, attentive and compensating.  Our Hummus was \"forgotten\", and so when it arrived, it was on the house.  No bother to us.  Everything else was so great, we were happy to have it for dessert.  I will be back soon to try other great specials.  And may make it my staple for Thursday nights."}
{"text":"OMG!!!  My husband surprised the heck out of me for the big 6-0.  Yes,I hate to admit it, but I turned 60 on Dec 28. I still feel and act like I am 30.   Anyway, he had the party at Prosperity because he knows this is my go to place in Tremont.  I love that it is casual, not uppity and borders on grunge ( in a good way) plus good food. It was perfect for my party.   The staff were great, food was damn near perfect and venue was \"my kind of place\". Thank you Prosperity for making my 60th Rock!  The only bummer was a friend who came from Florida had their car broken into while at my party. Not cool Cleveland, we are better than that!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times and I don't have anything to complain about.  I usually get food and it's well and beyond what you'd expect late night at a bar.  The sweet potato fries alone will make you come back.  The place attracts people who just want to have fun.  They usually have a band playing and their outdoor patio is really cool."}
{"text":"Never met a dish i didnt like. Service is hit or miss. Sometimes they are attentive,most times your waving them to you."}
