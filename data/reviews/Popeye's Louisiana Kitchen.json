{"text":"Good chicken. Horrible service. Drive through attendant was rude and obnoxious. And our order couldn't have been more wrong . Will never return to this over hyped place with my family again."}
{"text":"OK DONT GET ME STARTED ON POPEYES. THIS PLACE IS AMAZING AND THE BEST.
I came here 5:50 on a Friday night and I went to drive through. It was a 45 minute wait which totally made me evaluate my decision on coming here next time. Though I think I will wait till the hype goes down to come back. Though the wait was worth it. The chicken is delicious and crispy and everything you want. I had the $7.99 2 combo meal which include 2 chickens, a biscuit which is my favourite thing there because it's buttery and matches perfectly with the chicken, a choice of side, and a drink

Honestly this was so very good and I would come back on the biscuits alone. I FUCK WITH THIS SO MUCH.  If you had just eaten KFC since now, this will change your life because it's WAY BETTER. the only thing that sucks is the wait

Honestly its a good place to go but it is a tiny location and I could say how I alone could speed up the drive though but I'm not the manager. The food is great, service is polite, Popeyes is a good US branch, and blood is red. It's just the facts"}
{"text":"Ever since Popeye's came out I always wonder what is with all the hype? The drive thru is pretty long to the point it can almost go on the main road and have you seen the inside? It's usually packed. To me Popeye's is just like KFC but a bit more pricier, although their chicken is better than KFC.

Guess you can say Popeye's took a majority of KFC and other local fried chicken customer. 

So my girlfriend and I decided to go to the drive thru at 10:30pm in hoping we could give it a shot. Little did we know is that the line was was really long and there was a sign that says it closes at 11pm, so we wondered if there are some people that are almost close to the order box would Popeyes be deny them service or would they try to clear the line as much as possible? It wasn't until we came closer to notice another sign that says \"drive thru open until midnight.\" We proceed with ordering and got a 8 piece half-n-half family meal (half regular and half spicy) which includes 4 biscuits and your choice of a large size. I was disappointed on how the biscuits were dry and the fries were really stale - as if it passed the shelf life and the employees just kept it and didn't bother to cook a fresh batch for the customers. The chicken on the other hand was indeed like what everyone says; juicy and tender. Get this, we ordered a family meal but apparently it didn't came with a drink that was incorporated within the price of $25.

What I find that caught my attention was that there was a truck trailer just parked a couple of metres behind the restaurant and a team of 5 employees had to go out and collect more chicken. That's a big  red flag because it's not stored in the proper storage temperature and can contain cross contamination! The trailer could be temperature controlled but we don't know that so it's best to say that it is \"cooked\" through room temperature.

Although my experience was okay I would have to go back in order for a second review. 

Popeye's Louisiana Chicken is a definite must try. Would I recommend this restaurant? Probably to those who want to try something else besides KFC."}
{"text":"We stopped here for the first time in two years and my husband got food poisoning from their green beans."}
{"text":"We waited for 35 minutes in the drive through, but were excited to try something new and were really hungry so we each ordered platters, one regular, one spicy. You get a dry biscuit with your chicken order,  and a choice of two sides, coleslaw & Cajun fries was our choice. The chicken was over cooked, dry and very bland!  Such a disappointment after reading the reviews. We got 4 pieces of chicken each for roughly $30 & ate two pieces each and threw the rest in the garbage bin.  We certainly won't waste this kind of money on their so called Louisiana Chicken ever again."}
{"text":"Went there around 11am :) already a line up but managed to get out order in for family size meal !! It was pretty economical compare to OGam and Wow chickens ... services was fast and quick !!! Didn't come with drink ... just one order of side dish.( Cajan fried ) was amazing  ... biscuits was warm soft and very nice and comfy !! 8 pieces of chicken .. got half spicy and half regular ... honestly can't tell the difference... the spicy was not spicy enough and regular was crispy and crunchy !! Ready juicy chicken over all for the price ! Worth the trip and worth the wait !!! Because if we go to Ogam or wow chicken it will probably cost around $45-50$ ... the whole family meal with Cajun fried ,, strawberry pie and shrimp nuggets $33.00 so YAS to saving !"}
{"text":"I picked up some food from here today through the drive thru because I was in a rush and needed to bring it to my wife who was on the verge of going into labor. I get to the hospital and find out that the two 5 piece orders we got each had 3 chicken strips instead of 5 so I was short 4 chicken strips which is ridiculous seeing as Popeyes is already stupidly expensive. They basically shorted us on an entire meal so they were literally stealing from us because I paid for a two 5 pieces not two 3 pieces. Among other things they didn't give us a single straw when we had two drinks and they failed to put ice in my sweet tea. I'm thoroughly disappointed with all of these issues and will be filing a formal complaint with the location. Additionally, I'm pretty sure I heard one of the employees saying that she messed up the order and another employee telling her not to worry about it. You can't just screw over your drive thru customers just because they won't bother coming back to correct your mistakes. That is what happened today and I'm now seeking justice."}
{"text":"Great food and great prices. I'll def be back soon!"}
{"text":"Love it. Real crispy chicken. The way KFC used to be once upon a time. i was craving crispy chicken and popeye have it."}
{"text":"Popeye's is certainly a treat and something a bit different.  With the number of fried chicken places in Calgary (more than most people know) I thought they would have to go a ways to stand out.  I wasn't disappointed.  The breading is a bit different from KFC and Chicken on the way, it's both lighter and crispier at the same time.  If you like hot then get the spicy.  It's not burn your face off but it does have a nice little bite to it.

The line ups in both in store and the drive thru have thankfully died down as well making it a lot easier to spur of the moment chicken shop. 

The sides are good tasting as well and again different than the usual at KFC.  One complaint about is that gravy comes on the mashed not on the side.  The coleslaw as well isn't like what I was expecting from having travelled in southern US it is much more like the usual prepackaged affair most places serve.

The last thing to mention is that while I like drumsticks I have received at times up to half my order as drumsticks.  In an order of 12 pieces 6 of them drums?  It hasn't been that way on every order so I suspect it's more to do with whoever is serving up and what they have left on the racks.

Overall a good experience and very good tasting chicken.  Definitely worth returning and watching for offers/coupons."}
{"text":"We have eaten here numerous times over the past 3 years when we are staying in the area.  Today took the cake.  We both had 3 piece spicy with green Beans.  The chicken was small, old and dried out and was not the least bit spicy.  We paid $15.58 for 2 legs, 2 wings, 2 thighs, 2 green beans and 2 drinks from the fountain.  We love our Popeye's chicken but this franchise will no longer get our business."}
{"text":"What more can you say?  One thing I wish they had here that they do overseas is breakfast.  The Popeye's on bases overseas to a spicy chicken breast fillet with egg and cheese on a biscuit."}
{"text":"It is popeyes and burger king combined it was my last meal before I started my weight loss for the year. Thanks for a good last meal."}
{"text":"The only downfall is hours; 10-8 mon- fri,10-7 sat and 12-4 on sun"}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru. Food was ready by the time I arrived to the window. Food delicious and hot! Service was quick and customer service was great."}
{"text":"The sides are amazing, the biscuits are absolutely delightful and the chicken is crispy, flavourful and juicy.  I highly recommend this over any other fried chicken place like KFC or chicken on the way. The line up was huge though, so be prepared to wait a little bit, but it was totally worth it!"}
{"text":"A late night eat after a baseball game win! After playing two games of baseball, I was absolutely starving and didn't know what to eat. I decided to come here as my options for a late night eat were relatively limited.

When I arrived, the staff are welcoming and we're not trying to make me rush. It was one hour before closing and they were cleaning everything up. But again they did not make me feel obligated to rush my order. 

I decided to get a three-piece combo with french fries and a biscuit. I also ordered popcorn shrimp with mashed potatoes and a biscuit. 

The chicken itself was not that good. The drumstick that they gave me was extremely oily as if it was at the bottom of the tray. The white meat that they also provided was a little dry and the popcorn shrimp that they gave us were absolutely tiny. The french fries were old and the mashed potato was meh to say the least. 

Overall the meals were not good whatsoever, and it makes me hesitant to want to come back. I have eaten here on different occasions and it seems that a below average meal is the standard."}
{"text":"I had always wondered what Popeyes would be like - and for a vegetarian like me, I knew there wouldnt be much to partake in.  That said, my hubby and I went there mid week - mid afternoon - and to our suprise, even at that time of day it was packed. People were hanging out for tables  - and luckily I got one. 
I can tell you that without question - the biscuits are incredible. SO GOOD - so good in fact that we got a half dozen to take home. 
I ordered some sides - the coleslaw is deliciously different with dill in it.  The mashed potatoes are comforting and tasty, and the macaroni and cheese is rich and definitely a guilty pleasure. 
Now I didnt have the chicken - but my hubby said it was delicious- moist and tender - not greasy, but with lots of crispy batter. 
All around I saw people with insane amounts of chicken on their trays - and with all that crazy flaky breading - it all did look quite good. 
The service is fast and the team there are clearly well trained - its a well oiled machine in there. 
Piece of advice - go during off peak hours, and grab a table and then send someone up to order for you all, or you may end up without a table. 
Popeyes lives up to the hype."}
{"text":"Pros: Spicy chicken was delicious! Nice heat to it. Crunchy batter - the type that shatters when you bite into it. The meat was silky and not discoloured, bruised or veiny. Biscuits are quite tasty. Make sure you order some honey for the biscuits. The exterior was gloriously crispy and buttery. $1.29 apple pie tasted like a homemade churro. 

Cons: Regular chicken was a bit bland. The interior of the biscuit was not fluffy or flaky. Sides were all bad. Chicken fingers lacked a crunch, no flavour. Cajun fries were cold and old. Coleslaw was too sweet. Beans and rice were too salty. Mashed potatoes were tasty and come with a little pool of gravy on top. Sides are $6, which I think is too much for the quality and quantity.

Paid $50 for enough food for 5 people. That's good. Chicken tasted good reheated two hours later. Better than KFC and Chicken on the Way. Chicken quality not as good as Cluck and Cleaver. Pieces of chicken at Popeye's is bigger than Olive Chicken and cheaper too."}
{"text":"First Popeyes o went to in the city, have only hit the drive through, but it was always fresh and really liked it."}
{"text":"Huge lineup, it's boxing day 9pm and we were here barely 10 minutes. It took longer to find a spot to park than to order and get our food. 
Fast and good service and the chicken is yummy!
I want to add more to this review but I want to eat my chicken. 
P.s. it is probably faster to walk in and order them lineup through drive thru, the drive thru lineup was out around the corner!"}
{"text":"ammazinfly good chixken.  Why can't all places have this great the food. Is it so hard to learn to time and prepare everything properly. The chickeneers amazing tender juicy all the flavors you ask for the sauce is great everyone coming here it's an hour wait now line up anytime of the day. You don't even need to read this review if you see this place and you see a line up at the door you know it's the best most amazing chicken you are going to have. everyone orders 30 to 50$ worth here of chicken so just wait and it will come."}
{"text":"Spicy fried chicken and buttery biscuits! My favourite fast food. The spicy chicken tenders are better in the states but that spicy fried chicken is delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Oh my....I have never drove away from a drive thru before completing my order until today. Whoever was working at around 1050 this morning was absolutely terrible to speak with. She cut me off with such attitude, completely obvious that she did not want to work there (or ever). Guess what? You don't have to work there! Or anywhere that requires any type of customer service if you're going to have that type of attitude. 

But I'm sure the food would have been fine, if we actually had it."}
{"text":"If I enjoyed this type of meal, I would be giving it more stars.  Ordered 2 meals for my family, so I only had samples to review.  The chicken tender had a really flaky batter that I do prefer over other styles of fried chicken- meat was tender and juicy.  I have a huge weakness for fries- even though I wasn't in to the seasoning and they tasted like they are cooked in the same oil as the chicken- overall, mediocre fries but I still ate many of them.  The biscuits were amazing.  The corn was soaked in butter, which is not my taste at all (I actually prefer bare corn- so again, ate a lot but didn't \"enjoy\" the taste.  My kids loved it, but they still prefer Cluck and Cleaver."}
{"text":"Just got back from Louisiana where I tried Popeye's for the first time - thought it was really good for a fast food place. Was excited that Calgary had one but left disappointed as the quality was just not there and was expensive for fast food!"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!

There's always a line whether you're inside or drive-thru but it moves quickly and the staff are friendly.  The fried chicken (spicy) is amazing.  I wish they had the cajun rice at this location but they only have rice and beans.  If I lived closer, I would be there once a week, which would be dangerous for the waist line!"}
{"text":"Just got served RAW chicken tenders. Thank god I broke one in two pieces and looked at them. Avoid. This should never happen at a place that does crispy chicken all day, everyday..."}
{"text":"i mean its just fried chicken not much about it that stands out also the store is dangerously overcrowded we are talking about 100s of people"}
{"text":"Popeye's is another American franchise tapping into the Canadian market and no one is complaining. 

My husband and I walked in on a Friday afternoon and the place was packed. You can get combos that come with various # pieces of chicken, 1 biscuit, 1 side and 1 drink. Upgrading to the platter for a couple bucks get you another side. 

We got spicy and mild chicken flavors, and mac/cheese, Cajun fries and coleslaw as our sides. The biscuit was super rich and buttery. The mac and cheese tasted like KD but the Cajun fries and coleslaw redeemed an otherwise lacklustre team of sidekicks to the superhero. The chicken was fresh, the batter was crispy. However, it wasn't the freshest batch. To accommodate the massive # of customers, Popeye's had tons of chicken already sitting under the heat lamp. Therefore, parts of my chicken were dry. 

I still give this four stars because the service was friendly and I'm hopeful this unremarkable experience was due to meeting high demand. Popeye's is the chicken everyone needs, but not what we deserve. It's certainly worth another chance, but go when the crowds die down."}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I've eaten chicken from Popeye's. There are just too many other restaurant choices around. They were, however, one of the few places along my route home from work last night that was still open. This is a fairly new location, in a plaza that's still mostly under construction. It's spacious and bright with lots of seating.

I ordered the Thursday special, three pieces of fried chicken, for takeout. It's a decent deal for 4.99 but does not include any sides. It was still hot and crispy by the time I got home and the meat was moist. Good flavour.

Unfortunately, this morning I was reminded why I haven't eaten at Popeye's in such a long time. There is something about it that upsets my stomach. I can no longer view this as coincidence. Sorry Popeye's, I like your chicken but I just can't eat it."}
{"text":"Our new ritual after Sunday mass is stop here for lunch.  It's conveniently located just a block from the church in the Commissary parking lot on Nellis AFB.

Daily specials are offered everyday and on Sunday for $2.99 you get two pieces of crispy fried juicy chicken, creamy yummy mashed potatoes and gravy, a soft buttery biscuit with some honey and for $1 you get some sweet tea!  

How do you like that?  

I'm comin' back for more!"}
{"text":"OK, These are 5 fast food stars- so tamper your expectations to a level where you are receiving food in a paper bag though a window... OK, you there?

I went here NYE at about 8:45 PM. The restaurant is newly opened, and popular, I had heard stories of lineups and traffic jams, but man, when you need some red beans and rice, you need it, right? I have to say, door to door from my car only took 14 minutes- I think this was incredibly fast considering there were 8 people in line in front of me inside the store, and at least 10 vehicles waiting in the drive through. In addition, one person ahead of me ordered over 50 pieces, and this barely held up the line! I have to say, the staff and manager here are top notch. Let me say that again, the staff were handling this like pros- I hope they keep up the quality level and don't let it slide. 

OK the food- It's popeyes. If you have had the chance to visit this chain in the states, then no surprises here, if you have never had popeyes, and only know the sad existence of KFC, then you are in for a WOW! Chicken is crispier, juicy and deliciouser (I know that's not a real word) than KFC. The spicy style is where it's at- don't forget to ask for honey (it's free!) and hot sauce to go with. You can also order half regular half spicy for no extra charges. To be honest, it is not far off from Olive chicken, but with a cajun zing. And great sides. Mashed potatoes and gravy here are a total win! and of course red beans and rice (although I have to say I think it's better in the states, using a popeyes in Ottawa as comparison too, no idea why though...) Coleslaw is forgettable, mac and cheese is OK, fries are average but I always go for mashed potatoes or beans and rice. Corn on the cob is OK, but tastes watery- like it was cooked, frozen and then reheated (which in reality is probably exactly what happened...) The biscuits are really good too, but don't ever look up the nutritional info on those. Trust me, you don't want to know. really. just eat the biscuit.

Totally worth a visit if you are in the mood for fried chicken, but if you hate line ups give it a few more weeks, or plan a visit at an off hour. My only regret is that they don't seem to have \"Cajun Sparkle\" which are little seasoning packets that popeyes in the states always have- I fill my pockets with those when I can, so useful in the home kitchen ;)"}
{"text":"Great food but the customer service has gone down a bit in recent months.  Nothing bad.  I just get the feeling I am interrupting when placing my order."}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 star rating. Open despite the messy looking construction and hidden-ish entrances! It's a brand new location and it's very modern looking, bright, and open. Great for your dine-in experience. The staff were very friendly on my visit. The only thing I would say is that the chicken was a teensy bit drier than I would have expected and the spicy didn't do much more than tickle. The sides were tasty though. The biscuits were a great golden brown and the mac and cheese was creamy and cheesy."}
{"text":"This chicken is the best I've had, but unfortunately I tried only 1 piece and cold fries as my hubby picked up a 4 piece to go and only saved me a piece!! But I'm glad he did, otherwise I would never had tried it. So much flavour and you can get regular and spicy. It is juicy, not greasy, and the fries are well seasoned. I did not try cornbread as my hubby couldn't save a bite for me, but he says fantastic! I loved it, but I will do a true review when I can actually sit and enjoy the hot meal!!"}
{"text":"Well I actually went to the burger king right next door but the popeyes is a great place also. Borne places have great customer service. If you want something cheap not a bad place to go, but I recommend going after the lunch rush or you might be waiting for a bit."}
{"text":"Oh Popeyes! 

I have had Popeyes in America a few times and I thought we weren't missing anything by not having it but now that we have it, I am glad we aren't missing out! (That makes sense, right?)

The chicken is so good. I really like the breading, it's that good old southern fried thick skinned chicken! It is well seasoned, both the mild and hot are equally delicious! 

I think what make Popeyes so good has to be the hot sauce and the biscuits! We don't have any other fast food franchises that serve these items, I think! It's definitely worth it to try Popeyes, maybe wait for the hype to die down, we waited about 20 minutes in line. 

The only thing I didn't like was that the mashed potatoes already had gravy in it. And I am waiting for those amazing American pricing promos :)"}
{"text":"Ripped me off of a popcorn chicken that I didn't find out until getting home.  Then when I asked for mild, they mixed in a spicy that messed up the eater.  Attention to detail sucks."}
{"text":"Disappointing to say the least. Cold fries are really not cool. Soft drinks filled with huge chunks of ice frozen together enough that I couldn't get my straw in at all. At least the staff was polite and the chicken was okay. Probably won't go back to this location even though it's in a very convenient location for me."}
{"text":"Cheaper then KFC and tastes better in my book."}
{"text":"This is good fried chicken when you got a craving.  I always go for spicy buts it's not really spicy so don't be afraid to try it, I usually always put hot sauce too!
This time I tried the red beans and rice. It had a nice smoky flavor,  but it was served lukewarm.  I also got Cajun rice,  it was ok. Anyway I don't come here for the sides....

Lots of seating as its a combined restaurant with burger king. Not sure how packed it is during peak times since we came right after about 1230p, but it sure beat the crowded,  noisy BX seating."}
{"text":"Avoid at all costs. I'm a disabled veteran and have stopped here a few times after shopping at the commissary. 2 outta 3 times I felt like my insides were clawing their way out a few hours after eating their food. Someone is either dirty handling the food during the day, or not preparing it properly. Either way, I will not be returning again. Yikes..."}
{"text":"love the chicken and everything fresh. didn't like the gravy though. mash potatoes are awesome. had trouble for parking and very busy drive tru. busy restaurant and didn't have enough seats for stay in customers. Very fast service so I gave a five star."}
{"text":"Went on a Monday night at 830pm and decided on the drivethru thinking perhaps it might be a bit quicker. From start to finish it was about 40 minutes, so probably best to only come here in the beginning if you have time as they are still new and crazy busy! 
 The chicken was worth it! Got the mild and it was super tasty and crunchy. Will be trying the spicy next. Great portion for the price as we got the platters to try a couple sides. Fries are good, mac and cheese was ok. The mardi gras mustard is delish! 
 All in all a good experience to try but I will be waiting until those lineups die down to try it again!"}
{"text":"The south has come to the north(west)! Popeyes came to Calgary to a very hungry and eager crowd. I, like many others, have been wanting to try to ever popular American fried chicken joint and to see what the fuss is about. Verdict? Pretty impressed! While they don't have the full American menu (which includes the seafood), you obviously come for the chicken and they also have the Canadian twist of having poutine! 

They have a lot of combos to choose from and we decided on getting the family size for 4, which included 8 pc chicken (mixed regular and spicy), 4 butter milk biscuits and a side. We added an extra side so we can sample as many things as possible. The total came out to be $30 which I thought to be pretty inexpensive. The staff were incredibly efficient and polite and while there was a mix up in our order with one of our sides (the place just recently opened so it's been really busy and packed, so I don't blame them), they were quick to offer us a replacement or we could wait 4 min for another batch to be prepared. 

The takeaway? We got a super fresh batch so the chicken was incredibly flavourful, tender and crispy. The spicy had a kick to it, but it wasn't too overpowering. We got sauces as well, but they really weren't needed as the chicken was well seasoned. The sides weren't too bad! The mashed potatoes were pretty salty, but not unbearable, the biscuits were pretty good and the corn on the cob was drenched in butter. I'm not a huge fan of super buttery corn (thats just me), but I do know people that are. Will probably try different sides for the next trip. Overall, the chicken, staff and price get a 5/5! The sides are a 3 (for now). Will definitely be returning when the crowds subside."}
{"text":"Been coming here lots since it open. Food is great, service is getting better and better every time. I understand the line ups and waited one time for over an hour. BUT today! (Feb 22 17) I decided to use the drive Thur. (37 mins) when I was about to place my order, the lady told me that their debit machine is not working. Wish they had a sign or something letting people know, instead of waiting for nothing. Common sense. Who carries cash now a days?"}
