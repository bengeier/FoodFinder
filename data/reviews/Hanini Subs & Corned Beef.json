{"text":"If you don't mind grabbing your sub at a place where the other customers seem to be getting their midday beer, cigarettes, and lotto tickets, Hanini's is a pretty good bet.

The corned beef is very serviceable, and the gyro is enormous, tasty, and incredibly greasy.  Large selection of beverages, quick service.  It's more convenience store than restaurant so to-go is the only option."}
{"text":"I've never been to a more ghetto sandwich restaurant in my life.

Hanini has multiple locations in NE Ohio, all of them great. Except for this one. This looks like the stereotypical store that always gets robbed. There are bars on the windows so nobody breaks in to steal any of the Four Loko on sale here.

This is a convenience store that sells sandwiches after they sell cigarettes, lotto tickets, and 40s. No seating here, sadly.

I would give this place a more favorable rating if their food was at least adequate, but it's not. I got a $2.99 gyro for lunch. Great price for a large gyro. However, they used \"cucumber sauce\" instead of the traditional tzatziki sauce, which does have cucumbers but is yogurt-based instead of cucumber-based. It would be an otherwise great lunch if they wouldn't have used the \"cucumber sauce\". The meat was juicy and the veggies were fresh, but it was like I was eating that with ranch dressing. Absolutely ruined it.

Never. Again."}
