{"text":"Nice north indian... oops! did I say north Indian? in fact, it is typical Punjabi food.   Total (read as only) Vegetarian food. Nice sweets... Very tasty.   Overall: Value buffet!"}
{"text":"I would like to start off by saying I've eaten at Village of Punjab  (and Village of India under the previous owners) many times and been very happy overall. The place was a little rough around the edges before, but I always tolerated it because of the great food and service. What I witnessed on my latest visit prompted me to send out a warning to anyone considering even letting his/her watch stop at this dive.  Upon walking in the door, my four-year-old slipped and fell down on the slick floors, and my husband and I both struggled to get our balance more than once before even settling into our table. There is absolutely no ventilation in the place, and with the cooking in the kitchen and the hot buffet going, it's a sopping, steamy mess as was evidenced by the water literally dripping from the walls and windows. My hair was curling it was so humid! A mould-allergic person's nightmare, I'm sure. My guess as to why the floors are constantly wet is because steam settles on them and it's impossible to keep them dry. The owner/waiter watched as we slipped and slid to and from the buffet, and he even laughed heartily as our kid went right down on his bum as he tried to stand up from his chair.   And that brings me to the service. They obviously didn't have any wait staff working (on a Wednesday evening during a snow storm that's not unusual), but the owner had the decorum of a bag of potatoes, and I feel he should not have been serving food. He mumbled to us, inquiring if we wanted plain or garlic naan, and left. Our naan arrived while we were halfway through the first helping of food - my biggest pet peeve at Indian buffets. When we finished with our plates, we actually put them on another table beside us to give him a hint.  The food was tasty, particularly the naan. Some of the dishes were overly greasy, but I can often overlook that if it at least tastes good. Selection was also good. Can't complain there. One item that was disappointing was the saag paneer, which was utterly flavourless. Overall, it's good value for your money though, but only if it were a cleaner, more well-looked-after establishment.  Oh, and a trip to the washroom had me regretting even stepping inside. The sink and toilet were so dirty, I told my son to hold it in until we got home. The hallway leading to the bathrooms is absolutely vile and filthy as well. I'll be calling Toronto Public Health after I finish writing this."}
{"text":"The Village of Punjab offers excellent value for your money. The food is very tasty, great spice and really flavorful. The buffet has a good variety of items, including curry pakora, malai kofta, Saag paneer, peas and paneer, potato and methi, and others. The decor is that of a dive bar without the neon Bud sign. I generally get a selection of buffet items to go, and eat at home in a much nicer environment. It's good well priced food in an area that is sorely lacking in anything interesting or tasty."}
