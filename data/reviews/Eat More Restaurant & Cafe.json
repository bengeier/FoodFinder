{"text":"Best Pakistani restaurant in town! The ambience and decor is surprisingly nice for a desi place. Great customer service. Everything I've tried has been pretty good."}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic Pakistani food, this is the place to go. They're one of the rare places that make dishes like seekh kebabs, beef tikkas, karahi, etc the proper Pakistani way as you would get back home. It's a nice upscale place which is kinda rare for most Pakistani restaurants. Don't be turned off by the poorly chosen name. This place is top notch and serves excellent Pakistani food."}
{"text":"This restaurant would've gotten 5 stars, if our waitress had some common sense about cleanliness. She came to take the used plates and she decided to put our forks and knives on the DIRTY table (which we used again for main course), when there were TWO CLEAN plates right in front of her. She did the same thing when we asked her to pack our leftovers. Instead of bringing a tray to put everything in, she stacked a Naan basket ON TOP OF Chicken Karahi bowl and carried that in one hand, while carrying a rice plate on the other hand.... JEEZ! Just get a tray to carry everything, separately, at once! How difficult is that logic?... On top of that, she kept rushing us to order quickly and LEAVE quickly..... She ruined my mood and experience for sure.
Now, lets get to food. We ordered Chicken Tikka as our starter, 6 pieces were good enough for two people, and they were delicious. As our main course, we ordered Chicken Karahi (Delicious. though it wasn't boneless.), plain rice (Rice was very good. Nice flavor), plain naan (Wasn't good enough), and salad which was included with Chicken Karahi. We also ordered Sweet Lassi, which was very good and worth trying.

Pros: FOOD, lassi, nice interior.
Cons: Our waitress, Plain naan, starter was pricey for the quantity."}
{"text":"Amazing food and good service.  The best part is the ambience.  You always feel like you've actually gone out for a formal dinner and spent your money well."}
{"text":"Delicious Pakistani/Indian food. Cool Atmosphere and excellent customer service. Lots of options to eat. Recommended place."}
{"text":"One of the most expensive Desi buffet. what they give is a $7 value catering package available at any take out restaurant. Not worth it at all. 

Not recommended."}
{"text":"Interior looks decent and nothing like the outside. Food was good, above average pricing, but quality justifies it. Two things they should change, 1) upgrade entrance, 2) change name, 'Eat More' sounds low end."}
{"text":"The food is very good but the best part is the ambience! The decor and ambience were very good and very different from the usual casual pakistani restaurants. The food is slightly over priced but serving sizes are good. We ordered the malai tikka, butter chicken and mutton chops with butter naan. The butter chicken is very creamy and almost sweet so if you like it spicy, this might not be the dish for you. The food was fresh and tasty. I would definitely go here again."}
{"text":"Clean.  Food is decent but not amazing.  New restaurant with a modern decor.  Lots of seating.  Good for a team lunch.  Service was decent."}
{"text":"Very good ambience and service, we ordered palack paneer and tiger shrimp with biryani and house chicken. Overall  plating and presentation were good. I will likely be back but not anytime soon because chicken was under prepared and wasn't to our liking. Good but not great."}
{"text":"May be dinners are good but lunch express wasn't. Kababs were stale. When complained, the guy brought a new set and said \"we made fresh this time for you\", that was scary comment to make. There was no apologies for this break in our lunch. Biryani was good though!"}
{"text":"First post. I signed up to start reviewing this place, as well as others,  because I feel it is fair to both the management as well as customers. 

Myself and a friend went for dinner. The ambience is quite nice.  The appetizers (Chicken Pakora) were very good. 

We ordered boneless chicken karahi with nan. The nan was made with not enough flour nor yeast, as it was quite thin and became dry within 2-3 minutes. The karahi was undercooked; the chicken felt like rubber, and had no taste. It was not slowly cooked with the masalas - very obvious.  At that point, our appetite was ruined. I told the server and asked them, \"please give us a new dish that can be ready as fast as possible\", they said \"no worries, we'll recook your karahi\". Well, when they recooked it, it tasted even worse. 

We politely paid and left. We did not bring up any comment/request to not have to pay. Still, it would have nice if they made a gesture, considering the place positions itself as a fine dining experience."}
{"text":"I went there this weekend with family and had a pleasant experience.

Waiting time and environment/staff (5/5):
We were a family of 6, we waited for 5 minutes before being seated, which was pretty quick. 
The dining area is well built and maintained. 
The staff is courteous and helping.

Food (3.5/5): 
We ordered the family package + club sandwich on the side. 
The best thing was the club sandwich and I would definitely order it again.
The chicken Karahi with naans was delicious.
The Chana and chicken seekh kebab were okay. 
We also ordered chicken biryani but didn't enjoy it, you could get better biryani elsewhere. 

Overall, it was a little pricey but we had a good time and would recommend you to try it out!"}
{"text":"I give this place 2 stars for the ambiance and the service, which for most of the times we went there was good. However, the most important part of a restaurant experience is the actual food they serve you, and that was subordinary. We really gave this place many chances, but after continuously being underwhelmed by the food (no matter what we ordered), we decided that's it, and had to go hunting for other alternatives when we were in the mood for South Asian food. Our verdict is that one is better off trying these places instead:
BarBQ Tonite
Tandoori Time
Cafe de Khan
The Host
Mount Everest Restaurant"}
{"text":"A very high end impressive Pakistani restaurant in Mississauga. The place it self is beautifully laid out and you feel like it going to be expensive!

The servers are very friendly and quick to serve. Don't amazed at the portions of the food. It has a high end restaurant model and the portions and quality is there to meet any other high end restaurant. 

The food is a little bit pricey but the portion are not like other Pakistani restaurants but here you pay for nice seating, serve and presentation. I was with family so had to order multiple dishes to fill our tummies.

Tastewise:

Chicken Briyani - 4/5
Chicken karii - 3/5
Few different kabab plates - 5/5
Fried fish - 5/5

Overall the experience was good.

For my Muslim brother and sisters! They server Halal Meat!"}
{"text":"The food is good.  The place is nice.  Not the cheapest but worth the price if you are going on a date. If its not a special occasion, than there is cheaper options. Butter Chicken costed around $13 without a naan."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE OR ESPECIALLY CATER!

First of all I went in the restaurant to order for my party and was NOT GIVEN A RECEIPT after payment. I had cash on me and decided to use that. I paid the full amount plus tax and they refused to give me a receipt. Insisting that \"oh you've paid, we have your order now, don't worry about a receipt.\" Clearly, they were keeping it all and are not showing their sales on their taxes. This was the beginning of the crooked business.  

I catered my dholki event from Eat More last weekend. I usually enjoy their food in restaurant and was appalled by the horrible service for catering. 

First off, I had ORDERED FOOD FOR 30 people and received SUCH LITTLE FOOD- About half a small container for the dishes. I showed the delivery man that there was barely any palak or karahi chicken. All the dishes were filled with oil and karahi chicken was also in gravy like a korma, not like a dry karahi. He said he has no idea, he was just told to deliver. I was so shocked by how much i paid, and what i received that I told him to take it back, I was going to quickly order from paramount - and he literally just ran away. 

Next, the AWFUL FOOD. I paid extra per person to have BBQ chicken and kabab. The kabob tasted old and had a funny smell to it. The chicken was supposed to be one piece per person (which i paid $2 extra per piece) and I was given much less and also it COOKED IN THE OVEN NOT BBQ like i was promised. 

The Biryani was chosen to be lamb, but instead they USED BEEF AND THE MEAT WAS SO TOUGH to break and chew. 

The chutney was literally water, i had to last minute make my own. 

I called them right away during my event and the owner said \"not to worry, it will be enough\". It was clearly very little and in fact embarrassing. I had no time to discuss any longer on the phone, he was literally in denial. 

The next day I called the restaurant and spoke to the lady who took my order. she told me \"I should have brought it back last night to prove all these things\". Her delivery guy ran away and I had a party going on at the time. Why would i call to make up this whole lie? Then the owner came on the phone and started yelling at me and was so so rude. First they make a mess out of my food and order, then instead of apologizing, he had the nerve to disrespect me for calling and complaining. Does he not realize i paid him for the services he promised and failed to provide?

These guys are very rude and crooks. Took hundreds of dollars from me just to give me awful inedible food. I came to them and paid more than I would anywhere else in mississauga, in exchange for quality food. I was DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED. 
NEVER GOING HERE AGAIN AND WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND CATERING. 

Shaheen Foods in mississauga or King's palace in Toronto are the best places to cater."}
{"text":"Firstly: The restaurant name doesn't give enough credit to the classy interior. Lastly: The food was horrible, give me a second and I'll tell you why: We ordered The Shami Kabab Club Sandwich, Chicken Karahi & Mutton Chops. We also ordered Tandoori Naan, Tandoori Roti & Butter Naan along with sweet lassi. 
The food presentation was decent, in fact it lead me on lol. The mutton chops were 25% edible meat and 75% undercooked fat (when I bit into the fat I could taste rancid oil) and that was the case for all 4 chops for the price of $18.75 also they used the wrong seasoning for chops and used seekh kabab Masala. I've had better chops for lower prices in GTA & the chops ruined my meal. The chicken Karahi was decent but not your typical Pakistani flavour, the garlic and ginger was too overpowering. The bread used for the shami kabab club was dry and stale but the shami kabab itself was tasty. The butter Naan was literally dipped in butter and turned out exploding with oil in your mouth. The tandoori Naan and tandoori Roti were great. The sweet lassi separated in the glass so make you you stir before you drink, despite the constant stirring it'll still taste 'off' (bitter) and watery. The service was fast though & our server was polite, so no stars removed for staff."}
{"text":"Impressive presentation for a Pakistani establishment, from the ambience to servers and the food; definitely knocked one out of the park. Felt as if i walked in to the Keg or something. Seeing the owner as maître d and dedicated to his post earns my respect. He walked us to our table, introduced the server and back to the entrance he went. Servers are well mannered and food was brought to our table as if it were at a high end bistro so kudos for service 

Now some of the menu could perhaps be better BUT the 'Club Sandwich and fresh lime soda' is a trip down memory lane that I will take as often as I can lol. . My order screamed Lahore lol and I urge everyone (especially Lahoris) to give it a shot ... SO much better than the competition."}
{"text":"A fine Pakistani dine in restaurant. I have been  going there for years. Great ambience and service. Their qulfa is so amazing. Also club sandwiches, Lahori charga are worth to try."}
{"text":"Although the food at this place is great but disappointedly can't say much for their customer service and the owner himself.Heads up to families with kids, even though its a family restaurant but there's no diaper change facility and when u ask them abt it the owner told me bluntly change it in ur car!!! Talk abt accommodating customers!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and really nice decor. Ordered the Deggi Seekh Kebab Karahi (Beef), Eat More Special Karahi B/L and Chicken Biryani. Had it with fresh and tasty Nann and Garlic Nann. Everything was perfect! Nice and spicy too. If you looking for a nice place to go for desi food, this is it!"}
{"text":"The only Pakistani restaurant in Canada that  I can recommend to those looking for high end Pakistani (Not Indian or North Indian) cuisine. There is literally none other like this.

It is managed by the owners of the Shireen Mahal sweets and bakery shop which now has 3 GTA location.

They have a limited menu including several Karahi dishes. Both the Mutton and Jheenga (Shrimp) Karahis are exquisite and as close to the original Pakistani taste as can be. Another great feature is their Lahori Fried Fish. 

A major Pakistani celebrity and his family visiting from Peshawar were surprised to find food that could be compared to Haute cuisine of Pakistan.

Kababs and grilled chops are superb. The grilled list includes several good choices. 

Breads are always fresh and one should try their regular as well as Garlic naans.

The \"Thothe\",  a rice pudding dessert, is a surprise that only Pakistanis may know about. It is served in twin dishes and two people can easily enjoy it. 

The restaurant also serves a High Tea style snacks menu, and the Chicken Club Sandwich is to be tried, which can be very similar to the sandwiches served in any 5 
star hotels in Pakistan.

It is a pricey restaurant and can easily be in the $30 + per person range for a full meal including appetizers, mains, dessert, and soft drinks. Alcohol is not served.

Service can some times be spotty, that is why I held back a star. Their managers are always there however may appear indifferent to even their repeat customers.

Some may find their berth style seating to be uncomfortable since these seats are quite narrow. One should ask to be seated on the tables with chairs. There are several in their cavernous dining area. 

Despite some shortcomings, Eat More is a restaurant worth trying

Muslims should note that it is Halal cuisine place."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch, the butter chicken were extremely small portion. The flavour was okay. The basmati rice tasted too moist. The ambiance reminds me of a moxie. 

My friends found their dishes a bit bland too. Room for improvement in terms of flavour and portion."}
{"text":"The only good thing about this restaurant is their ambiance. The food is over priced and not fresh. I wouldn't say it is a kid friendly place either. The customer service is horrible. Despite, this place pretty much empty; the staff kept on coming to pick up our plates shortly after the meal arrived. Limited yet typical menu that you will find in most Pakistani restaurants. Overall the food was Tasteless, with poor service. I would not go there again"}
{"text":"Horrible place.  Manager is a racist ahole. Average food with expensive  prices. The manager asks the person in front of me to pay when he picks up his takeout but for me he makes me pay now. And I am Indian."}
{"text":"The ambiance of this place is very comfortable. The food was absolutely delicious. And the service was very good."}
{"text":"I just tried their club sandwiches to-go, they were  just fantastic.I guess I loved it more because I was soo deprived of them!

For people Who don't know what a club sandwich is-it is a sandwich with three layers of bread, with cheese, chicken spread(with mayo), cucumber, tomatoes and a layer of plain egg omelette.The sandwich is made with white bread which is toasted and then layered.It goes really well with lots of ketchup.Club sandwiches are served with fries and coleslaw!

I would rate this sandwich a 7/10 mainly because the sandwich lacked the chicken spread and they didn't put cucumbers on it!Secondly I thought it was way too pricey for a sandwich !I think it was close to $14 for this sandwich!

But overall loved the flavor and throughly enjoyed my sandwich in the car!Will def come back again!"}
{"text":"$14 for the 10 little chunks of beef tikka was just way over priced for what I received (which came spicy even though I requested it not to be hot at all and clarified this point over and over to the waiter) The butter chicken tonight was different than the first time I ordered, it seemed to taste like it had a bit of strong pickle added. Very unfortunate experience. Even the bread, which was the reason I chose this place last night didn't seem fresh at all, and priced on my bill much higher than it is on the menu. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"This place seriously surprised me. From the street, Eat More does little to catch one's attention. Even from the parking lot, it is difficult to see this being a standout restaurant in a food plaza already so abundant with options. 

Admittedly, I would've never dined here without the recommendation of a friend. I expected it to be a small takeout joint, but upon entering I was amazed to walk into what was a well decorated, classy restaurant. 

I've visited twice now - both visits coming during non-peak times - so I can't speak to the normal busyness of the place. However, if the service is anything like how we were treated during the slower periods, I'm sure they can handle high traffic just fine. The staff were very attentive and eager to explain all the options they had to offer. 

In my visits, I've tried the following dishes: chicken pakora, Eat More Special karahi, chicken karahi, palak chicken, mutton karahi, mutton shanks with masala, lahori fried fish, and the chicken tandoori. These dishes are all meant for sharing - and naan/rice and other sides must be ordered separately. 

Personally, my favourite dishes out of the ones I've tasted are the mutton karahi and the lahori fried fish. The mutton karahi is deliciously creamy and juicy, while the lahori fried fish is an interesting twist to your typical British style fried fish. Surprisingly, my least favourite was the Eat More Special. I'm not much of a fan of ginger, but because it was their signature dish, I had to try it. All of these dishes were very well made though, and I'd definitely recommend anyone to give them a shot. 

For dessert, I had a mango lassi - delicious. It was nice and thick, and also came in a very generous portion. 

I'm a huge fan of Eat More - their dishes are incredibly consistent and the hospitality is great. Definitely a top pick to take people to in Mississauga."}
{"text":"Pro's:
Interior wise this place looks closer to Canyon Creek or the Keg . Definitely nice to eat in the better ambiance.  The brand new burrito Boyz is right next door if you don't like the food.

Con's:
Expensive. I don't mind paying if the quality is there..and it was . 
I only tried the Tandoori but  chicken and the beef seekh kabobs was delicious. Interesting the food was not overly spicy like most Pakistani cuisine.
Will return to check out how the curries fare."}
{"text":"Expensive. Ambience is very nice for a night out for a date and a desi restaurant. Well kept. Clean and service is excellent. Servers are well dressed. Not many options for meat curries. We ordered biryani, kabab and karahi. Food tastes fresh and good. Naans are excellent."}
{"text":"If you're looking for an upscale Desi restaurant, this is a pretty nice fit. It's very classy, and its prices scream \"fancy shmancy.\" Definitely not a casual, grab and go kind of place. 

The food is O.K. Definitely not worth the price! The only thing I would recommend is their club sandwiches (as have been recommended by other Yelpers!) The sandwiches are still pricey, at around $10, but they're worth it. Also, the tiny toothpick swords they come with are adorable!"}
{"text":"It's one of the good restaurants we love to go frequently.... probably we have gone there 7 or 8 times till now.

The ambiance is wonderful, it has a classy touch in decorations. The staffs are polite and very well mannered. They will also suggest you with good recommendations and warnings, if it tastes different than the commonly available dishes. You will feel like going there again.

The foods are really good.... They have limited items in their menu, but many of them are quite unique and not commonly found in other Pakistani/Indian restaurants."}
{"text":"The only well-decorated Pakistani restaurant i could come across in the GTA...very nice and formal ambiance...food is absolutely delicious! A little pricey but if you are in the area, try their lunch menu, it's well priced and covers some of their most delicious pakistani items and sandwiches...love their home-style fries with a hint of chat masala, their kabab and biryani and karahi are some of the items one must try..."}
{"text":"A decent, clean, well maintained upscale Pakistani-Indian restaurant. It surely looks like a fancy place in comparison to other similar cuisine restaurants. Ordered several items such as butter chicken, boneless chicken biryani, seekh kebabs and malai boti with naan. Those were all great. The daal on the other hand, not so much. It lacked salt, spices, and flavor all together. Regardless, I would suggest going here if you have guests visiting or want to host a party. The ambiance is decent."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the outside appearance, this place is a hidden gem. The ambience on the inside is absolutely amazing, it's very well furnished and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"Food was acceptable but the quantity was not nearly enough.  We had a group of 13 for lunch,  and ordered food for 16 and it was just enough. I'd hate to think if it was for dinner and guests were young adults instead of the elder age group!  Plenty of naan left over though, if there was actually more of the main and less of the sides.....  Service was acceptable, would appreciate the attentiveness in the beginning instead of at the end.  Also tips were charged on the entire bill instead of the actual meal.  Somehow, the impression they are trying to give and what actually happens don't seem to match."}
{"text":"The restaurant looks incredibly nice from the interior but the food is only subpar. I ordered Mutton Chops, Chicken Biryani, Butter Chicken, Tandoori shrimp and Seekh Kababs. 

The Mutton Chops killed the experience, they were very hard to bite and the serving size (for such a large cost) was small; they actually tasted microwaved.

The Biryani was on average, but lacked flavour by any measure for me to give it above 3 stars.

The Butter Chicken and the Naan were actually very good 4/5.

Tandoori shrimp woukd also be about 3 stars.

In all due fairness, the food tasted microwaved for everything other than the butter chicken and naan. Based on the cost, I don't think I would return here again. There are far better alternatives in the city."}
{"text":"Club sandwich and Nihari was awesome.  Good customer service but expensive.  
Keep it up"}
{"text":"I visited Eat More a few Fridays ago with my team. We had one colleague from Brazil visiting us, so we did a welcome lunch for her. 

My manager drove us over there. We were a group of six. As usual, we didn't have a reservation. There were plenty of tables available at noon. 

This small plaza has a ton of eateries. I have only been to three of them now. I have plenty of time to eat my way through them all. 

It is a bit of an anomaly to see a club sandwich on the menu. Everything else seems to be Indian. I am curious to give the club sandwich a try the next time I am here. 

I went with the butter chicken. It comes with rice, naan, and salad. We end up with a small communal salad to share amongst ourselves. I still find that odd, but I understand family dining and perhaps the need to reduce the number of plates. 

I loved my butter chicken. It was so good that I sopped up the sauce with the warm, fresh naan. I was so full, but didn't care if I needed to be wheeled out of the restaurant. 

We were there for two hours. It was a good chat and meal. I'd definitely come back.

{"text":"The service is ok and their food is ok... Their prices are too high. I always wanted to try this place and honestly, I didn't find that the food was that great. It was good and some dishes had more taste than others. Meh."}
{"text":"Eat More also known for Badshah Grill is not one of the best Pakistani restaurant when it comes to their food. Ordered Lamb Karahi and Badshahi. (6 boneless chicken tikka boti and 1 skewer). Lamb Karahi was really blend there was no flavour. The Karahi lacked spices I was only able to find a little blend of tomatoes and a hint of green peppers. Literally no taste at all. As for the Badshahi the boneless chicken was rough and cold from the inside. It did not have any form of specialty or any spices/mixture on it to give it some flavour. The skewer had minty taste to it but no other spices were found in it. Further, it was watery when breaking it apart. Overall the food was mediocre and I would not recommend that you try this restaurant as you will feel the same disappointment I felt. It would be much appreciated if management finds away to fix the food problem and I would try this place again to see if it worth it. Right now it is not the greatest/not  going back anytime soon. 

Let's talk about interior of the restaurant. When you enter the restaurant it actual looks as if the food is going to be good. (Just looking at the restaurant)As the interior is Importantly designed for fine dinning. The staff are working hard to the best of their abilities. The customer service is good. However, when orders are placed it takes sometime for them to come to you. (Understandable). 

To end of, I would like to say. This place doesn't taste like a Pakistani restaurant. Also, we are not going to a restaurant for its looks. But for the quality of the food the restaurant provides. This restaurant might look good from the inside but when it comes to food there's nothing to see. As if you're eating but you feel nothing. 

They say eat more. I say eat what again?"}
{"text":"The food is Absloutely tasteless. I have been to a lot of Indo/ Pak. Restaurants, so this one is below average. Restaurant is clean and look fancy, but not much flavor."}

food was tasteful, good portions and for the set up the price was expected 
the ambience of the restaurant was very welcoming, well set up, and formal. if you are looking for a good time with a formal setting close to a fine dining experience this is a place to try. alhmd keep it up Eat More!!"}
{"text":"Came here once before and made an ordering mistake and it wasn't good but my friend who's half Indian loves this place so for her bday we came back. Holy cow their chicken tikka masala was AMAZING. They had a family combo for approx $60 for 4 ppl and there was chicken biryani, a curry dish, a veggie dish, and kebab with options you can choose from each category (except chicken biryani) and comes with 4 pops and tons of naan. The four of us were so happily full. Besides the chicken tikka masala as my fave, the chicken biryani was also great followed by the beef kebab. The lentil dish we got wasn't my fave but it's good just not what I prefer. We ordered medium spicey and it was still super spicey for us but honestly worth it because SOOO good the tikka masala plate was dry. Highly recommend!"}
