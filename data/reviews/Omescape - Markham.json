{"text":"Can't go wrong with board games, video games, escape rooms, bbt (presto) and frozen yogurt (Yogen fruz) all in the same place. Service is excellent and the interior is suitable for small or large groups.   Only downsides if I have to name some would be the limited parking space that's actually close and it's slightly priced above average."}
{"text":"The atmosphere in any of the rooms in Omescape are some of the best in the city. The themes are very well done, and the rooms are designed beautifully. You never hear other groups around you and are immersed for the entire hour, unless you manage to make it out. The puzzles are great, requiring to search around, work together, and most importantly pay attention.   With all that being said, what sets apart Omescape from all the other places is the outstanding engineering that goes into each and every room. It is not as simple as getting a key and opening a door to the next room. There are moving parts, and opening each room is an accomplishment of it's own.   The staff is extremely friendly and courteous. While you wait, there is ample seating space and plenty of board games to keep you accompanied.   Overall, if you are a fan of escape rooms, or looking to try one for the first time, I would definitely recommend Omescape."}
{"text":"We had been to Omescape so many times already and finished all their rooms, I'd said within the city Omescape might be one of the expensive ones but looking at their techs and mechanics inside their rooms and venues, it would make sense for their price. They have $5 off when checked in to Facebook (if I remember right) and Tuesday boardgames and drinks night. You can collect stamps from drinks to get one free drink.  I had my son's first birthday being held at their venue at that time when escape games was a popular gaming expensive back then and the space was big enough for friends and kids to play around, they moved away some tables and chairs to create more spaces for the kids to run around and are very accommodating for a huge group of 50 people.  The owners of the company is friendly and attentive, they always address to issues right away.  All their games are very straight forward and some also gives a little bit of suspense, mysteries and challenges. I'd have to say the experience was one of the best within the city, it's definitely worth to give it a try!"}
{"text":"Each time we have some sort of tech issue, but we  keep coming back. My husband and I have done three here, each with different groups, and the one in Scarborough too. It's nice to have the board games, bubble tea and frozen yogurt at the Markham location.   Kingdom of Cats was our favourite here so far. We appreciated the fun theme. The use of space was appropriately creative for the theme and the clues fit in well. The game used a lot of varying skills, which worked well for the group we brought (and we would have failed without different skill sets available!). At the end, we have to almost pry the door open after solving the final clue. Ignoring that part, this room was 5/5 for us.   Project Sphere - our first high tech game and it gave us a pleasant surprise with the first applicable puzzle. One puzzle was tedious, but I can appreciate the value in it too. A section didn't work and we spent a lot of time trying to figure it out, not knowing. They really should have caught it on the cameras, and it took some effort to get them to acknowledge that it affected our experience. Still, if everything was working then it would have been a great room.    Penitentiary - this was way beyond our group's ability (mostly beginners).  When they showed us what was left we thought we would have needed double the time!  It's less linear than the others, and one or two puzzles had too many elements that weren't clearly connected.  I  also found the atmosphere less exciting. Still, some memorable props that are worthy of praise.   We will likely end up doing the other rooms because the location works well for us, we like the games/food, and Kingdom of Cats was so impressive."}
{"text":"Here it goes! My boyfriend's family and I drove here all the way from downtown Toronto for literally nothing. We had a reservation for 7:30pm, we were going to do 2 escape rooms (we wanted to make it worth the drive) they took a deposit for the rooms and everything was set to go. We got there at 7:10pm and it turns out they took the deposit but failed to book the first room so the manager apologized and offered us free drinks, a discount for the second room and the possibility to stay there and play for free. Since we were already there we were like \"meh, might as well\" so we sat there for 2 hours waiting for our next booked room to be available.   We signed the waiver form, payed and waited for 1 hour and 50 minutes, hold on to your seat cause it gets worst, 10min before we were supposed to go in the manager tells us that the door is broken soooo no escape room for us.   It gets worst. They start giving us a refund (at this point my bf's family were as mad as Gordon Ramsay when someone undercooks chicken) and one of the workers approaches the manager and say \"the door it's fixed!\" So I go HALLELUJAH!! But I got excited for nothing because they said \" sorry, there's another group ahead\" OHHHH, but how? If our booking was for 9pm, it is 9pm! They apparently knew the door was broken but just didn't want to tell us.   I feel bad for the manager because he was really mad about everything that happened and even gave us a free escape room for next time but, let's be honest, it's hard enough for me to want to leave my apartment for food so leave it to go back to a place where I had a horrible experience. Nah, Sorry."}
{"text":"Great all in one facility with lots of board game options and escape rooms! We were introduced to this place by a friend, its around $12 to sit and play their games and a $4 ticket for a drink. The only downside to that is nearly all drinks are over $4, so you are likely to pay a little extra. The place is clean and spacious. You can ask staff for game recommendations and show you how to play the game.   We didn't try the escape rooms but other seem to be having a lot of fun playing and they take a \"success or fail\" pic at the end of you which is quite neat. Recommended if you are looking for a place to play board games and have bubble tea."}
{"text":"The escape room was well thought out, and the clues were well done. The setup of the rooms were nicely detailed as well. The staff were very friendly and explained things well.  I haven't tried the board games or drinks, so I can't comment on those. But my friends and I will be back to try the other rooms. Can't wait till the new ones open up!"}
{"text":"I have been to about 5 different escape places and I can easily say that this is one of the very best. Each room I have done here was really creative and fun (even if you don't get out). The staff is nice and welcoming and they have board games available as well. A must go for all escape room fans! Easy 5/5 from me."}
{"text":"This was one of the first places I've been to for escape rooms and to this day, I still find it to be one of the best in the GTA.  I've done all of the escape rooms at this location and I would say my favourite ones are the Kingdom of Cats and Jokers Asylum.  There's also ample tables where they have a board game cafe and you can order bubble tea.  Overall great place and I'm looking forward to the new rooms at the Scarborough location!"}
{"text":"I'll keep this one short because I've only done one of their rooms. The Kingdom of Cats was one of the strongest rooms in the city. The teamwork, moving parts and logic in the room are phenomenal. The only downside to this place is the price tag. It's one of the most expensive places and they won't discount for multiple games or anything else like that.  The being said if you're a newcomer to the whole escape game experience this place would be an excellent first shot. It's a little too expensive but they offer a very user-friendly experience. The other downside would be that not many other rooms are this good, so it might only be downhill from here.  If you're more experienced but haven't been here yet then this is a great option. There were only three of us in the room and we still managed to complete the room without any clues, so I would say it is a little bit on the easier side, but so well done that it wasn't a letdown in any way."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic time at OMEscape today, we went for the dark alter course, smart puzzles and I gotta say the service is the best I've ever experienced at any escape facility. The bonus is that there's also a Prestotea and a really nice board game lounge area. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This is such a great place to go! The escaped room I went is very well designed and really fun! Service is really good! They are very friendly and nice. There are a lot of board games to choose! We spent more than five hours straight in this place and had a great time! Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"A real fun place with friends! Came here to celebrate a birthday and it's was enjoyable. Will highly recommend it for those in the area looking to have a fun night out."}
{"text":"Brought my team here for an evenings outing and team building excersise.  It was the first escape room for the team members and third time I had ran through one.  Found the puzzles in this one (Kitty Kingdom) to be challenging and the production value was the best I have seen.  Had to complain to attendant for longer than I felt appropriate in order to get our time extended after we and the attendant determined one of the lock combinations had been changed.   Thus rendering us unable to proceed despite knowing the correct answer.  We did however get some time extension and proceeded through the puzzles.  Unfortunately we did not escape but the team loved the experience.  Will likely return (perhaps to avail ourselves of their boardgames selection as well)."}
{"text":"Really cool room for the Kingdom of Cats story. There were some technical difficulties with some of the machinery but the secret door and tunnels are so worth it to just experience. Unlimited clues with a walkie but if you use clues you can't be on their Super Special Ranking. Like them on Facebook and check in for $5 off."}
{"text":"Service was good and the staff are nice.  Bright clean place to do gathering. The number of games are vast and generally in near new or pristine condition. I would recommend to gather a small group of friends to come.  Plenty of parking. Would recommend adding sign in the plaza for direction and promotion of the store.    However,  I'd recommend the store to provide more options when it comes to drink and game combo.  Currently there's only an option for one drink and unlimited game pass.  I'd recommend providing two drinks and game or drink, food, and game combo.  This gives more variety and options for patron.   Would come back again."}
{"text":"I had been to Omescape before and had a really good experience. The room was immersive and really fun based on that I would have given them a great review. But this is not the case. After spending a week talking up this place as one of the better escape rooms in Toronto, I decided to organize a back to back escape room night with a group of 5 friends.   I had some problems booking the rooms online so I called. The staff was helpful (or so I thought) and walked me through the booking process. I booked the rooms got the confirmation emails even called back to check that I had the rooms booked. Everything was set and ready to go (again or so I thought.)  So the day of, myself and a group of 5 friends take the 30 minute drive up to Omescape really excited as for most of my group it was going to be thier first escape room.  Our first room was booked at 7:30pm and we arrived at 7:10pm. When I went to check in they said I had only been booked for one room. I was surprised showed the my confirmation email and receipt for my deposit. They said apparently the staff never actually booked me for the room and just took the deposit. I had said I confirmed my booking they day before, how is it possible that I got confirmations that my booking was good to go but never actually booked. The manager said there was nothing they could do.  I was uspset but really wanted to just leave since the next room was not until 9:00pm and I did not want to wait for 2 hours for the next room. They offered us 25% off the next room and free drinks for the whole group. So we stayed and played some board games.  About ten minutes before we were due for the next room the manager came and said \"bad news the door in your room is broken and you cannot go in\". Really upset at this point I said just give us full refunds so we can leave. We got our refunds and were about to leave when the manger ran up and told us the door was fixed and that we could go in. Great but.....  There was another group ahead of us and we would have to wait an hour before we went in. At this point we would have to wait 3 hours just to maybe do the room. So I said I was not going to wait and I just want to leave. I pulled the manager aside and asked when they knew the door was broken aparently the door had been broken before we arrived and they didnt want to tell us after they messed up our first booking and had hoped that they would have it fixed by then.... WHAT?!. Had I known this when I arrived I could have salvaged the night instead of waiting at Omescape for no reason.  Needless to say I probably will not go back. I suggest Escape Games Canada the rooms are better and the staff actually books the rooms properly. Seriously go to Escape Games Canada...."}
{"text":"Omescape has some of the coolest escape rooms in Markham! Our group of friends have tried every single room and I think we've gotten out of about half of them. Besides 1 room (I think it was the hospital) we enjoyed every single escape weather we won or not. The staff are always super friendly and we've never had a bad experience with them.   If you haven't been to a higher end escape room place, than somewhere like Omescape is a must try. There are lasers that have to be dodged, secret doors that must be opened, puzzles that need to be solved (in different rooms) and missing pieces to be found.   The technology and design that goes into each room is really quite marvellous and can really be appreciated. The first time we actually saw a door open by itself leading to a new room, was one of the coolest moments.  Omescape also has a wide variety of boardgames available if you don't want to do an escape room. And on Tuesdays you can play for as long as you want for $5! We've done this a few times and as a game board phonetic, it's always been fun. We've found new games here that we later on, ended up buying which is always nice.   Overall Omescape is one of the best escape places in Markham and if you're looking for a truly challenging yet fascinating escape, Omescape is a place to try. I've recommended this place to many of my friends and will continue to do so!"}
{"text":"I went for board games on a Tuesday, which is when they have 50% off. For a total of $5, I got unlimited play time and a $4 off drinks coupon, which I used to buy a presotea (on site). That's an incredible deal!  It got louder later, when it became more busy, but nothing too bad. The game selection was awesome, service was great, and playing space was spacious and clean. Room decor was also cool.  Loved it! Highly recommend (especially on Tuesday)."}
{"text":"My favourite place out of all the escape rooms I've been too (which is quite a few) Briefing is thorough Staff is on point Rooms are absolutely amazing Intense, get you thinking overall an exellent time They have board games and BBT so you can chill before your room escape."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here for after-dinner board games night. It's definitely a great spot for just chilling - if you're not already coming for their escape rooms (which are top-notch by the way). There is ample amount of room inside, but the parking lot is a bit tricky as the spots are rather tight. For about $12 after tax, you'll get to play board games from their collection for as long as you want and get a complimentary small drink/frozen yogurt (toppings and large size are extra charge). Based on experience from various people, we definitely advise that you opt the drink over the yogurt - the quality is definitely not up to par to your typical Yogen Fruz product. Overall, the service is swift, very friendly and we will definitely stop by again."}
{"text":"I've been to a few board games cafes before, and I know what to expect, roughly speaking:  - Buy a tea/coffee/some kind of drink - Play the games for free - Lots of variety of games  Omescape disappointed in every dimension. You have to pay to play. If the payment was equivalent to a drink amount, that would be fine. But it was around $12 to play. I felt ripped off immediately. Granted, you get a drink for those $12, but it's a $2-$3 drink.   The other problem is variety - they don't have nearly as many games as other board games cafes. And my favourite games - scrabble and boggle (that I would think are staples of board games cafes) aren't there, either.  Overall, I wouldn't go here again."}
{"text":"I did the joker's room and the last puzzle didn't make sense at all. When we called for help, the guy said \"I just know the answer but not sure how to get it\"   Also really really bad customer service. The girl at front desk gave us attitude from the beginning.   Never come back again. Rather go Escape Game. cheaper and much higher production value.   Ps: I don't work for any escape game company and it was my first time to be here at omescape."}
{"text":"This is probably the best room escape in town. I had played the Dark Alter with the party of 6, and our experiences are very positive. We arrived 15 mins before the booking time as suggested; the stuffs are very professional starting from safety precaution then briefing the background story of the game.  I had been to mutliple escape room in Toronto, Omescape is one of the most incorporate many mechanical pizzles in their rooms. The Dark Alter is my third room with Omescape, this one had quite a bit of reading, we didnt end up leaving the room within the time limit, but we got to play for another 20 mins because there is no booking after us.  Although the price is a bit higher than the other room escape, but the game had multiple room (4+) with heavy mechanics employed in the game makes it worth every penny."}
{"text":"Omescape is definitely one of the better escape rooms.  Note that they are hidden in the back of the plaza so it will be difficult to find if it's your first time here.  So far none of the rooms have a scary factor which is great for the faint-hearted.  They even have a cat-themed room for the cat-crazed, and their unique room themes is definitely interesting.    Even more impressive is their collection of board games - however, even room escapers do not get to play for free.  It's an additional $5 (or on Tuesdays) but is regularly $10 (though this includes a drink of up to $4 in value).  A few things that prevent Omescape from getting a 5-star review:  it's definitely on the pricier side - understandably drinks cost extra but board games costs extra too?  Where most places allow a 1-hint policy, Omescape allows as many hints as you'd care to ask.  This could potentially be as a result of some of the puzzles being too out of the box or too hard for the difficulty rating it was designed for.    Also, note that the bubble tea place here (Prestotea) do not make tapioca on weekdays!  (!?!?!?!) Which seems a little ridiculous - literally every time I've been here they were out of something or another - tapioca, mochas, etc.  And the wait time for the bubble tea can be quite ridiculously long.  I understand it's the same staff that man the bubble tea place, but sometimes it can take up to half an hour to get a drink."}
{"text":"Just went back for a board game / charity event, they literally doubled their collection of games, lots of good titles, and categorized them into different levels of complexity using coloured stickers which is quite smart! This collection satisfies both the hard core board game geeks and the beginners / party gamers. The drinks are better, they ask you for your desired level of sweetness and tastes much better than before. Didn't have time to try their new escape rooms, perhaps next time. They seemed pretty busy on a Sunday. Good fun!"}
{"text":"Love the concept of this place! Coming from LA, the only city that has a higher concentration of bubble tea shops and escape rooms, I really enjoyed Omescape. Omescape combines all of my favorite pastimes/hang out activities all in one: escape rooms, bubble tea, board games. All of the above can be had for a set fee which is very decent, considering that with social media check-in you get a $4 discount. The \"unlimited board game\" extra fee price that you pay is really just to make you buy a drink. The $4 wont get you most of the menu, so be prepared to supplement that cost. They had 4 escape rooms, and we did the Kingdom of Cats. We chose an easy difficulty one to do on purpose, we escaped with time to spare. The escape room was well constructed with great decor and moving elements. We had a lot of fun, and the cat theme was going strong. The puzzles werent hard enough for us to shout \"let meowt!''  I highly recommend coming to Omescape if you have a few hours to kill, because this is a great place to have a fun time with your friends. Make sure that you have a few friends who know more complicated board games (beyond monopoly) otherwise the board game wall will be very disappointing and you will spend a lot of time reading instructions."}
{"text":"their customer service is great, and booking arrangements are way easier to deal with than Real Escape Games (and casa loma). They request a $20 deposit for a room of 9 people, which is WAY more doable than what Real Escape Games asks for: $310 upfront absolutely non-refundable! also, I really like how Omescape has a bunch of boardgames in case you arrive too early for your escape room, or want to hang out after the escape room"}
{"text":"Kingdom of Cats was a great escape room, it's a little tight, but the puzzles and tricks are really great!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty nifty!  It's an escape room place with at least 5 rooms to escapee from... but if you didn't book a room you can still Come in and enjoy playing board games.   By the way, if you want to sub in ice cream instead of a drink... ask people working, they'll do it!"}
{"text":"I love it when escape rooms make use of new technology  Please don't hate me for spoiling, but doors do open in the rooms, and yes...shelves too!  It's honestly like Indiana Jones and you feel like part of the show/game.  The staff members are super helpful and genuinely want to help everyone experience the full story.  I have played board games here and escape rooms, gotta say that the place has been kept pretty clean.    This place is a little difficulty to find, just remember that it's in the back of the plaza."}
{"text":"One of my biggest complaints for board game cafes are that they have VERY limited seating. If a cafe 'does' have more tables, they can never accommodate more than 4 people. Omescape provides solutions for all those complaints.  At Woodbine and John, the entrance is in the back (behind the restaurants in the front). Once parked, the location is quite large and can accommodate many tables, and large groups as well. With what looks like picnic tables and some large high top tables, each table can accommodate at least 6 people, if not more. They have just as good of a selection of games as other places, as well as offering the escape rooms.  The pricing was pretty good as well. With about a $10 sitting fee, it included a drink from their Presotea bar at $4.00. It didn't include the tax of the drinks, so you have to pay the difference, but a large drink would turn out to be just an extra $1.50 and a regular about an extra $0.55. Not bad in my opinion. They do have an option for half price days where you sign in on a social media as well.  A great choice for a night out with friends. Just make sure to book ahead if you're headed in for the escape rooms."}
{"text":"Omescape offers escape games and doubles as a board game cafe with drinks and snacks.  We did the Penitentiary and it had a lot of things going on. In hindsight, progression is straightforward as long as you find all the clues and figure out how to proceed. Good communication within the team is vital. When they say all clues only apply to one puzzle, it's true.  For an extra $4 we could play board games for the rest of the day. The $4 also goes towards covering the cost of food/drinks, so it's not a bad deal if you're planning to do a room and then stay for some other games, as you can play games while you wait and they will reserve the table for you when you're doing a room.  They have a good library of games to choose from, from two people up to larger parties of 6, 8, and up.  If board games aren't your thing, they also have some video game consoles available.  Overall, a good experience."}
{"text":"Omescape was on the pricer side of escape games on a weekday. $25 with like and check in on facebook.   The whole lounge area was very spacious. I can definitely see this as a good hangout place on a Friday night to play board games and also drink some bubble tea.  Staff greeted us once we came in.   My group and i ended up playing Joker's Asylum. Based on what ive heard from my friend who tried this room the other day, its fun and challenging. So i chose this room because my group loves a good challenge even though we didnt escape it was a good time.  The pro's of Joker's Asylum - Decor and tech of the room was pretty awesome!  - Clues were challenging because of the team work that is put into these puzzles.  The con's of Joker's Asylum - The overuse of walkie talkies - hard to hear and a time waster when trying to communicate to one another throughout the whole game - If your claustrophobic, ask to be in the bigger group. You'll thank me later.   Id recommend this escape room to players who love a good challenge. I'll be back again to try another room."}
{"text":"Soooo much fun.  Very impressive rooms, so many multiple rooms in the themes,  high tech,  deigned wonderfully.  Did Cat Kingdom (which sounded lame but it actually we really enjoyed it and it was so cute), dark altar and the study (highly recommend this one and cats)   Has old school game systems and board games to play while waiting. Has a photo area with props and the staff are so nice and friendly.    Multiple rooms!! So you're not confinded in only one room to escape,so high tech and I can't spoil anything you just have to see how great it is for yourself   One of the best escape room there is, coming back to do all the rooms!!"}
{"text":"Good Things I've tried two escape rooms: the mysterious study and the dark altar. They were both pretty good, around the same as trapped but not as good as escape games. I do like how there's a presotea there as well - as who doesn't want a bbt? They have a good selection of board games too, and the atmosphere is nice, although it can get quite loud at times.   Bad things  The person that came to get us at the end of the room rushed through the explanation so fast, and I'm not sure why cause there wasn't anyone booked after us. But at least she wasn't rude like this one staff named Karen - she was very rude to me and my bday party of 10, and I'm not sure why? Maybe she's just like that. Of course this is just one of the staff, but the negative experiences with staff always stick out more than the positive to be honest. Also the washrooms got progressively nastier as the night went on. Lastly, they have yogen fruz and yogen fruz normally accepts spc. For some reason they wouldn't accept it, and was quite mean about it as well."}
{"text":"Our escape room was booked for 7:15 p.m. on a Saturday night.  We all arrived at 7 p.m. promptly in order to get settled in and sign our waivers.  However, we actually weren't able to start our game until close to 7:35 p.m. because apparently the group that was ahead of us playing \"Kingdom of Cats\" was late and pushed our slot back as well.  Hmm, this didn't leave a very good first impression because we were kept waiting and since we arrived early, we really didn't play our game until half an hour later.  The staff at Omescape should perhaps arrange their room bookings a little better if this is the case."}
{"text":"Recently I just had my first Escape Game/Room! I had a great time doing this, so I just want to share with you guys my experience :) .  We had to book a time slot online in advance! I guess walk-in(s) aren't available for these type of activities(?). We originally booked for 630PM, but because of conflicts, we ended up rebooking at a later time which was 1015PM. Booking online also required a deposit fee, and they do allow you to reschedule - but you would have to forgo your deposit should you cancel.  Omescape was hard to find because it's behind a restaurant in a tiny plaza. The location was actually pretty ghetto and hidden because there wasn't any signs either, and parking was pretty full even when we had arrived around 930PM.  Omescape was a combination of bubble tea (prestotea), frozen yogurt (yogen fruz), board games, and escape room in one big area. There was also a stage with chalk designs and writings for photo ops for the Escape Room contenders, which you can view on their Facebook page.  The area had an okay amount of space, their tables are pretty big - more intended for groups. They barely have any small tables for groups of 4, for example. People usually play board games and drink bubble tea while chilling in this area. It wasn't decorated anything fancy, in terms of decor or on their walls, etc.  Omescape offers 5 different Escape Rooms - Dark Alter, The Penitentiary, The Kingdom of Cats, Joker's Asylum and Mysterious Study. Written on each room was the difficulty level, with suggested number of people when attempting to escape that particular room. Most of it sounds horror based actually... Our group consisted with quite a number of first timers (including myself), and with individuals who have been once or twice max. So we decided to go for The Kingdom of Cats because their difficulty level was only (3/5) which was one of their lowest difficulty levels, plus it seemed cute and fun/not scary for some of our first experiences.  When we arrived, we checked in quickly with the front desk. The girl attending to us told us of their \"social media promotion\" which was to check in and like their page on Facebook for $5 off! Liking their page was based on each individual - which we had to show her and she checked for confirmation. Some of their other packages were listed on an information sign (shown below). But we weren't interested in sitting and playing board games, etc.  We arrived early for our appointment, but lucky for us, the room was available and we were allowed to go in earlier than expected! :) . Omescape provided 2 lockers for us because as we were putting our jackets (because winter), it wasn't enough to fit everyone's... so they gave us 2 lockers instead - which was nice of them to do so. The guy escorting us also said to leave our phones in the lockers, in order to maximize the experience - like no cheating or Googling or extra flashlight, etc. We watched a video regarding the rules and regulations of the Games. In Omescape, they said not to remove any paintings or decorations. In some other Escape Rooms, removing paintings were allowed. But each place is different in it's own way. We were also offered a radio if we needed hints throughout the game - they offered unlimited hints for us (not sure if it was for everyone/every room).  After that, we were given blind folds and asked form a line and put your hands on the individual infront of you. We were led into the room, and the guy read the story line of the room to us. Given the story line, it helps with the ambiance and puts you in sync with the theme of the room!  Obviously, no spoilers here but we were sooooo close to escaping the room!! I think most people say this, hahaha, but we were actually really close!!!  I had a lot of fun, and I would honestly give it a 9/10! The decor and set up was really well and seemed very professional. Everything was relating towards the theme of the room, and how everything in the puzzle connected. I do enjoy puzzle games, so that could be an attribute towards my rating. I was doing research about Omescape before heading there and most people said that the quality of the place was better than most! It was pretty pricey ($28 with social media discount) but I'm happy that I got what I paid for."}
{"text":"My favourite escape place thus far! (over the past 2 years I've been playing and I've probably been to over a dozen places). Perfect combination of puzzles and tech. Multiple rooms to pass through vs. just one space. PLEASE COME UP WITH MORE ROOMS!!"}
{"text":"By far the best escape room I've been to! We did project sphere, didn't make it out but still had a great time and were very impressed by the setup and stuff in the room. I gave it 4 stars because it's a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Played Dark Altar with a party of 10. I've been to a few other escape room locations and this was definitely one of the better experiences I've had. We were briefed before entering the rooms with some rules for safety and precautions. All parties are blindfolded before they are brought into the rooms. The rooms were very creatively designed with interesting puzzles, riddles and a good use of technology that went very well with the theme of the room. We were given a walkie-talkie if hints or immediate assistance was ever required. There were no restrictions to how many hints we can get, but you get recognition for escaping the room without any help within the allotted time.  Came here on a separate occasion to play boardgames only with a few friends. Purchased the unlimited board game pass that gave us access to 200+ board games to choose from. This pass came with a free drink token which can be used at the food station inside the facility. There were many tables laid out everywhere for people to use on a first come first serve basis.   Overall, the location is very good with lots of parking and the pricing is very reasonable. Will definitely be back to try another room very soon."}
{"text":"My friends all agree it's the best Saturday afternoon we've ever had of the year! We had sooo much fun at Omescape.   We played Dark Altar, Joker's Asylum and Project Sphere and enjoyed all 3 games. High production value, good set design, a good commination of challenging puzzles and fun puzzles. Require a lot of teamwork and creative thinking, not scary :)   I played more than 30 escape games and some of my friends only played a few. Omescape is great for everyone in our group.  I came from USA and it really surprises me that you can play such a high-quality escape game with this price.  Between games, we played their board games and enjoyed milk tea. What else can you ask for a group of gamers :)"}
{"text":"I think it's safe to say that I'm a bit obsessed with the concept of escape games, and I'm always looking for new places to try. I thought I found my favourite one about a month ago.. but then I came to Omescape and I was blown away! It takes a lot to impress me now that I've experienced quite a few puzzles, but Omescape managed to bring fresh ideas that were super cool and fun. The room was extremely well done, and everything made you feel like you were really part of the story. The staff were very nice and helpful, and the one difference I noticed here was that you can ask for unlimited clues. I think this is a good option because it keeps you from stressing out about the amount of clues you have left so you can focus on the game. However, some rooms need a minimum number of players, and I'm not too keen on the idea of limiting the amount of people that can play a certain theme.  On another note, the actual place is very nicely renovated. The board games area is bright and roomy, and they have a tiny pool and foosball table. I wouldn't say they have a huge selection of board games, but they definitely have the staple ones available (with the exception of Cards Against Humanity, lol). I also haven't tried anything on the snacks/drinks menu, so I can't comment on those. Overall, I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a new twist on escape rooms or even just to hang out for a night with friends and board games. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Always a fun time at omescape! I've been to several escape rooms in Toronto and I have to say omescape is definitely my top choice! Tried several of their rooms and overall their themes, the decor and the game itself is all very well set up and thought out!  They also have a big board game area with a good selection of games, so it's always a good hang out place for us after an escape game and they even have bbt there! Definitely a great place to hang out with friends for a few hours!  Will go back and try out their other games and would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"First time coming here and it was so much fun! My friends and I chose the Joker . It was a multi room conquest. We had to work together as a team to solve all of the clues in order to escape. I would definitely recommend this place for a fun night out with family or friends.   There is also a place where you could play board games while sipping on bubble tea while they sell in house. First thing upon arriving would be to check in with the reception, sign your life away... joke joke! and pay and have fun!"}
{"text":"Great place. Very friendly staff. We did one escape game and had loads of fun. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I Went to this place at Sunday 5:00pm., we had a large group of 14, and we made reservations for escape room, for 9 of us, and 5 of us were doing just board games,. Now i've been to this place before and it didn't leave a good impression the first time, however this time it was beyond terrible.   The escape room itself. our group had booked the reservation that we were told 5:15. they did not enter till 5:30. and even though we had to wait on a reservation which was not good, the ridiculous part, was that the staff kept rushing us to pay early when some of us arrived at 4:30 to wait for others. they kept repeatedly rushing us to pay early yet they knew they were going to be late. thats just not good.    Now that was not the reason this was a one star review. The next thing was how they earned their 1 star status.   the 5 of us that were doing board games, we went to order the drinks from the vouchers that were included. While we were waiting in a line with nobody the 2 staff members who were working on drinks, it took them 15 minutes to even acknowledge us before taking orders. and the ridiculous part was that the whole place had only 2 tables of 6 ppl filled. and they were taking that much time before even acknowledging us just to place an order. Once we finally managed to order, which that in itself somehow ordering drinks for 5 people. took 10 minutes to do. so we just spent 25 minutes just to order drinks in a place that was almost empty, where there were 2 staff dedicated to just drinks. and there was no line. This would not even be the worse thing            of the 5 of us who ordered, they had managed to get 2 of our members the drink wrong, and 1 members and this is the truly amazing part. they got her drink wrong you can be ready to be amazed, it was a wait for it...........Legendary 5 times. 1 person, they managed to get her drink wrong 5 times, and each time it was something different wrong. and on top of it, originally they had even forgotten and lost her order. Of the two servers, one of them the front order taking person he was nice and kept apologizing, however getting a drink wrong 5 times is just amazing in and of it itself, however the person who made drinks, he was plain rude. when we were ordering he kept telling us the reason they couldn't take our orders faster was because it was not all placed in one bill.... this was a takeout style bubble tea order station, so that reasoning was just...............         2 people in our group also ordered French fries, since their menu consisted of very few things, and the comment was the oil was heavily reused and it smelled very wrong.   It seems like the staff is poorly trained at best, there were 3 other staff who had nothing to do, who just sat there and twiddle their thumbs at the front desk. and could not even help the two drink people. and also who don't' even teach games.   This place was nice looking, organized and clean, however their biggest weakness and this i noticed twice being here, is definitely their staff. The people who work here have no idea what they are doing, its no wonder most people who come here are just for escape room, since there is no service required.   I would advise against going here for all people who plan on ordering drinks, or anything requiring service. just do the escape room at best, because that part i heard was well built.  I will definitely not ask anyone to come here, especially given that of board game bubble tea places, there are plenty around the area which are a lot better."}
{"text":"I was never a big fan of escape rooms, but Omescape is definitely a fun one to visit.  Please reserve your room early on from their website: www.omescape.ca because it's fairly hard to get a spot there on the scene. All of the rooms give you 60 minutes to escape, and range from 3/5 difficulty to 5/5 difficulty. They have different groups of people required for each rooms as well, from 3 to 10 players. Currently, prices are $28.20 per person, with a $3 discount if you post on Facebook - so definitely pretty pricey. If you add $5 on top of this, you get to stay for unlimited boardgame playing and a free yogurt/small sized premium drink for this.  Omescape has Presotea located right inside it, definitely a nice place to get bubbletea afterwards as well.   You can most definitely spend the entire day here - the only question is, would you?  They have multiple rooms to unlock for this omescape, and a cute story line. For someone who's petrified of mysteries and unknown things, we got the kingdom of cats, which was super duper cute.  They also provide you with a walkie talkie to help you answer the questions - but if you ask for hints, you won't be able to go on their wall of fame."}
{"text":"This review may be a little premature as we heard that the escape room we completed was the best one (Project Sphere Mysterious Study). Our group of friends have become Escape-Room fanatics and the tech in this room was absolutely top notch and had us begging to do more (if only there were other rooms available that night). A must try! I hope the other rooms will be as good."}
{"text":"Super fun! I went here with my team for an off-site and we had the most amazing time.  It's an escape room + board games + Cafe combined.  Highly recommended and I may return with friends.  Escape Room: 4/5, the room was very interactive with sliding doors and fun puzzles.  I would like to try the others if they are going to be as fun as what we had.  Cafe; 2/5, the bubbletea was not as good as what I'm used to in the area and you kind of have to pay more on top of the package which is not really free.  Board games: 3/5, not as many collections and the condition of the games is not kept well but the seating is great - bench style."}
{"text":"I don't do escape rooms because \"why pay to escape when you can be free for free?\" so no review on that there. Like, if I pay for a scary escape room, I'd better end up dying.  That being said, this is a great spot to hang out with friends because it's a more low-key, more asian board game cafe complete with the presotea and all. You pay just under $13 and you get unlimited board games AND  a free bubbletea. They offer a large bbt menu, straight from presotea and froyo. It comes pretty slow though. Every time I've been there, it's taken them approximately 45-1 hour to deliver 1 bbt to our table. Maybe the processing time is long? Unsure.  There are a lot of board games available and even video games. They have a large variety, including the main and most popular ones. Some games are out of date and need to be replaced - the cards against humanity one, obviously the most popular, upon crowds is grimy and sticky. We play this every time we come here and we all rush to wash our hands after. Some games are missing instructions while others are missing pieces. They do have a suggestion sheet @ the game shelf though. 90% of the other ones are alright though.  Service is always good, the people that work here are super nice!  Ps. please get the 'what do you meme' game!"}
{"text":"Omescape is my favourite escape rooms located across the GTA. Each of their rooms are designed really well so you can tell they put a lot of effort and planning to create the best experience for their customers. There are many hidden doors, multiple rooms, and challenging puzzles that you must solve with your friends before escaping. Since their rooms can get quite complicated, they give unlimited amounts of hints.  Besides their rooms, half of it is also a board game area and they have also partnered to preso tea! On Tuesday, they even have half off board games where you pay around $5 to play their games as well as getting a free bubble tea.   My friends and I have already done all their rooms and we are very excited to hear that they recently opened a second location in Scarborough!"}
{"text":"This is one of my preferred escape facilities.  They have an impressive lobby with a huge selection of boardgames.  Their production quality is top notch and the technology is very impressive!  My only complaint is that their puzzles are not always intuitive.  But unfortunately I think the puzzle quality is the most important aspect of a good room escape which is why I can't give this place 5 stars.  I think maybe the rooms were originally designed in another language.  Their story lines often don't make much sense."}
{"text":"Came here for my first escape room experience. I like the idea of bbtea and board games that they have in the main room.  I'm not going into details of the rooms itself and although it was a fun new experience and pretty challenging, I felt like $30 per person for an hour is a pretty steep price.   Also, there was a $5 off promotion if you i) check in on Facebook and ii) like the post. I understand that it's part of their marketing but what we didn't like was when some people in our group didn't want to do it/ doesn't have Facebook they were pretty persistent and kept saying we can check in on another form of social media.. Came off as being too pushy."}
{"text":"Came here on a saturday night as a walk in with a group of 5. Luckily there was 1 room still available and we did the The Penitentiary theme (4/5 difficulty). For almost $35 you get 1 escape room, board game time and a drink token worth $4, most drinks are over $4 so you will have to pay extra for your bubble tea (which was mediocre). altogether it felt a bit expensive.  Our group of 5 was divided into 2 smaller groups, we were blind folded then the game began. The escape rooms are much more elaborate that others I have been to there were moving parts, spraying fog, tablets and lasers. After an hour we didn't get out, the staff came in to explain the answers and process - it was very (very) difficult I really don't know if anyone can solve all that in an hour...  The game selection is great, lots of variety and lots of large tables to play and felt clean, but some people do hoard the games on their own table which isnt very nice. It can also get quite loud in there, which is understandable.  The staff was ok - they weren't super enthusiastic to be there, they cared more about eating their sushi banquet dinner behind the desk more (which is in full view when you walk up) ps. its in the back around the building which was a bit tricky to find as well."}
{"text":"Tried out this new \"locked in a room with no escape\" concept. It was amazing!!   I have been to a bunch of different of these places when they first started popping up in Toronto. This place is by far one of the best and well made rooms. The concepts are amazing and the quality of the rooms went above and beyond my expectations. At the moment they only have one room available, however I will definitely be back once they launch new rooms. Definitely where you go to experience a true \"locked in\" experience."}
{"text":"I joined a group of friends for a Saturday escapade at Omescape.  We got the board games & escape room combo and played the escape mission titled \"Kingdom of Cats.\"  Neither me nor my friends were great escape artists, so we did not beat the room.  However, we managed to solve most of the clues and had fun along the way.   (This is a spoiler free review, so no specifics!)  I have been to Omescape multiple times and played several of their escape missions.  I have played Joker's asylum and Mysterious Study (I believe it has been renamed - to project Sphere) in prior visits.  Overall, the missions at Omescape are well designed and each mission I played has a cool factor to it.  One thing I like about Omescape is they permit you to contact the front desk and obtain multiple hints if you are stuck during the escape mission.  For me, the escape rooms I played were all tough mission, so I would say Omescape has high difficulty and is hard to beat,  Likes: -Escape rooms are well designed -Service is great, the staff are friendly and helpful -They have many tables and a good variety of board games  Didn't likes: -Omescape is slightly pricy, escape games are around $30 per play (I think I paid $33 for the room escape + board games combo) -occasionally, there is a clue that don't make sense to me, even after getting the hint it feels confusing  Overall, a fun experience that I would recommend to a friend. 4.1 / 5.0"}
{"text":"By far my favourite board game place! For a decent price of $10 you get unlimited board games and $4 off a bubble tea or yogen fruz.   There's a great variety of games ranged from skillful to simple fun party games. Games are well sorted and multiple versions of the same game are available.   I've been here about 10 times and would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times for escape rooms, they have one of the best escape room in Toronto, with different themes. I find that there's nothing so easy but sometimes it can get very challenging, you actually need the kind of educated knowledge to solve the problem. They have a wide selection of board games the price you paid for broad game comes with a drink. Always thought my money is well spent at this place."}
{"text":"Rather than your typical Saturday night on the town; bar hopping and dancing, I decided to keep it low key which required some tactical critical thinking.  Omescape is a hidden spot just north of Woodbine Ave and Steeles in the same plaza as Carmelina's, but at the back!! This is actually my first ever game board cafe experience, and it was certainly fun. Just beware of board game hogs that decide to take all the good games and stack them on the side of their table.. Gosh people have some etiquette! Anyhow this place also has escape rooms available as a secondary option.  If you're not into neither, they also serve various bubble and milk tea at their food station. Omescape has available packages such as unlimited game boards with drinks, etc...So it's easy to spend hours at this venue.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"My friends and I had a great experience at Omescape.   The staff cared that we experienced the full effect of escaping into another world.  We picked a room called Project Sphere: Mysterious Study.  It was about a secret agent entering an advanced laboratory for clues on where secrets might be.  All in all, the high-tech theme was very convincing.  Definitely worth the time and money because of all the laughs we shared! Do try this place!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars and unfortunately no round up.  My friends and I came here just for the board games because we didn't make a reservation for an escape room prior to coming, so they were very full.  The business has a decently sized selection of games - just three shelves. We were satisfied with the choices, and enjoyed the $4 drink voucher that came with the $11 board game pass. As well, it's an all day pass so you can head out to grab a bite and come back!  The only thing disappointing was the service. I felt that they were a bit understaffed (3 people). When we first arrived, we had to wait a while before we could pay to play because all three staff members were briefing three escape room groups. As well, to exit the building we needed to obtain a stamp so they know we paid. Again, we had to wait a while for someone to notice us as one person was briefing an escape room while the other two were making bubble tea.  I think I might come here again to try their escape rooms, but I hope they improve their service."}
{"text":"I am an escape room fans and have been to many escape room in Toronto and Asia. Omescape is so far the best escape place i have ever been to. I have done all of their rooms and recently did Dark Altar with my friends. ,The tech works perfect , the lighting and background music blown me away, the puzzles are fun. Also fun to watch friends screaming out loud.   They also have board game area and bbt at the Markham location, with no time limitation. Very good place to hang out for the whole day   Will definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Omescape gets 5/5 stars!!  It was the first place I've ever escaped the room - soooo happy.. FINALLY! haha  (I've been to other escape places before but I'm always a clue/two away.. urghh)  We tried the MYSTERIOUS STUDY room. All the clues were sequenced so we were able to escape - without any hints! My friend enjoyed the walkie talkie conversation. Whenever we used it, they asked us \"Did you want a clue?\" and my friend said \"No, time check please.\" Haha Don't want to give any spoilers out - but I can say that this room is very techy and the way they \"unveil\" the next room is super cool.   They have a very spacious board games and bubble tea area too - I like how the set up is more spaced out unlike typical bubble tea places (usually packed together). We will come back for more board games / escape the room games!"}
{"text":"Tons of fun! Our group of 7 solved the Project Sphere room. It was challenging and had many separate puzzles, and was totally worth it."}
{"text":"Tons of escape rooms popped up in recent years across the GTA. By far, for rooms, this is the best place to be. They seem very detailed and organized in the rooms where as other locations I've been to tend to have very worn out props they just haven't replaced. The clues are easy enough to figure out but just challenging enough to kinda get in your way. Depends what level you choose really.  They also have bubble tea and board games in house for an extra fee. It seems to be a nice place to hang out with a group, but I think $$-wise, this place is a bit expensive for a casual hang out or making it some regular activity.  I think it's the best escape room in terms of quality, but they lack a star because of the pricing & one of their clues was wrong, costing my group 5-10 or so minutes of the game.. we ended up being a few seconds away from solving it towards the end. That kinda sucked..  Still, i would come here again :) seems fun. Minimum 3 people I think?? So bring some friends!"}
{"text":"- Large facility for board games, escape games and Presotea/Yogen Fruz - board game area is spacious and bright with plenty of tables - good selection of board games. We played Cash n Guns - quick and fun group game!  In a group of 7 we tackled the hardest room (Joker's Asylum). Very impressed with the high-tech decor and I really enjoyed the theme and challenge!   Came on a Sat night which was ~$32 after tax and Facebook check-in. Includes the escape game plus unlimited board games and $3.99 drink. Expensive but worth to try at least once! Overall had a fun time here and would recommend!"}
{"text":"Our group and I came in to play Joker's Asylum. I don't want to give away too much about the game.. so I'll try to keep it short.  I thought that the decor and tech in this room was pretty amazing. A lot of thought was put into the rooms on this aspect. The clues were challenging and left you with a feeling of accomplishment, but the biggest problem I had with this room was the fact that the group is split into 2 and were given walkie talkies to communicate. Walkie talkies are a hindrance in the fact that sometimes it's hard to hear the other end, and only one side can speak at once when they are holding the button. It seemed like a time waster.   At the end, we were not able to escape. We had the staff come in and explain the rest of the game to us, and we were so close!  As for the rest of the facility. This place is HUGE. There's a big area in the front for you and your group to play boardgames. But - you have to pay. I did look at the selection of games though, and it is large and in a wide variety, which is good. They also have a Presotea bubbletea shop and a Yogen Fruz machine. Pretty neat!  This escape room was on the pricier side. We checked into Facebook and liked them as well to receive a $5 discount, and still it came to $24.80 per person on a week day, I think it probably would have been over $30 on a weekend. That, plus the charge to sit and play boardgames etc.. a little too much.  I probably would come back to try one of the other escape rooms, but not too sure about sitting to play the boardgames."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a friend who has  completed all the room at this escape room location and said that this was the best location. I must say this location is pretty fancy and sophisticated! However, similar to other reviews - I found the price to be pretty steep. Since our group decided to go on a weekend evening (Friday - Sunday & holidays tend to be more expensive) it was more expensive (around $25-30) as suppose to going on a regular weekday night. You get $5 off for checking in on Facebook. If you don't have data - there's free wifi for you to check in with a smart phone! They were okay with me checking in on Yelp - so for all you Yelpers, checking in should be okay!   Something I was bothered about was the $20 deposit when booking the room online. Don't worry, it's not extra, but when you pay for your room, it's going to be accounted for in the price. I understand it's for security.   The room we chose to do was the Penitentiary. I'll try not to give too much away but I thought the beginning concept of the room was interesting. They said to split our group into two as we were going to be separated at the beginning and then they blind folded us into the rooms which was a bit bizarre for me. Apparently, this room was a sequel to another room, the Mysterious Study which we have not done before. It's not a big deal if you've done that room or not but I think it would've been nicer if we did that room first instead of the Penitentiary. Speaking of which, I had no idea how you could've completed everything within the one hour as there was so much to do! Unless you want to be elite (which is when you complete the room without any hints) I suggest to call for hints when you need them instead of waiting last minute.   On a plus side, there are laser beams if you're interested?! Also board games and drinks in the lounge area if you want to chill after wards.  \"Preach Omescape\""}
{"text":"Last night was my second time at omescape. It has also been the second time they have taken forever to get my gf's bbt. It wasn't even really that busy. There were a few tables still open unlike the first time we went. Further to that, their bbt pictures are deceiving. One of their drinks looked like there were mango chunks, but apparently they were mango pudding. The description beside their pics did not show what was in it, so it was far easier to assume. Aside from their drinks incompetence, the place is ok. Haven't gone there for their escape games, rather just been for board games. Their games list isn't that extensive, but the popular games are there.Some areas are tight to walk by, but the benches are fairly comfortable. Otherwise, had a good time with some good friends. Can't complain too much."}
{"text":"I did the Joker's Asylum with some friends and it was amazing. We had a big group and a few people came late but the workers were patient and kind and didn't take time off even though we started 15 minutes after our booking time. The room actually ended up being 5 separate rooms that all had their own puzzles and riddles and it was such a fun experience. So many surprises and the riddles really stump you-not something for inexperienced escape roomers. We managed to finish with only 20 seconds left so it's definitely doable. They serve bubble tea and some food (e.g. fries) and they also have a lot of board games to play for a small fee. Sort of like a board game cafe. Will be back to try the other rooms!"}
{"text":"I've been to a few escape rooms throughout Toronto and the GTA and this is the only place that seems to impress me every single time. The games have multiple rooms which is amazing!! I love it here so much, and we always get bubble tea after which makes the experience alot more enjoyable! Will be back!"}
{"text":"I did the cat room. It has a great theme and fun puzzles. We didn't make it out, because we were stubborn about using hints."}
{"text":"Omescape is a new escape room/board game cafe located in Markham. They offer 5 escape rooms, a wide selection of board games, and some vintage gaming consoles such as the Nintendo N64, NES, SNES. Btw the store is located at the back of the plaza, which can't be seen if you're just casually driving by the area. There are plenty of space for free parking.  Escape room: I tried the Kingdom of Cats escape room in a group of 6.  After giving us a video to watch about the rules we were given a walkie-talkie to hold on to so we could ask for hints when we get lost. Then we were blindfolded and a staffer walked us to our room. I think the blindfolding part was unnecessary because the hallway that leads to many different escape rooms is pitch black anyway.  The game itself was straight forward, and each clue will only be used once. The decor was really nice and totally fits the theme. Bonus points for all the fluffy, cuddly kitty plushes everywhere!! There were total of 4 rooms within the Kingdom of Cats themed escape room, so it's a good value for the cost of $25.   Board games: If you've already been to the escape room then for extra $4 you can play unlimited board games, the $4 will also go towards purchasing a drink.Otherwise, the cost is $10 which also comes with $4 for drinks purchase. Here at Omescape they have most of the popular board games available, like Uno and Monopoly, but I wasn't able to find Settlers of Catan. The board games are fairly new, given that this place opened not too long ago.  Gaming console: Same deal as the board games, you can play unlimited gaming console games with the board game pass. We played Mario Kart on the N64 in a group of 4 and the experience was kinda terrible, because the screen we got to play on was small, and then it had to be split into 4 smaller screens, so we ended up not being able to see where the turns are until it was too late.  Also, the consoles are located at different tables, so if you want to try out another console you would have to move over. Some people do end up playing board games at the table where they played the console at, thus hogging the spot.  Drinks: The drinks are made by the in house Presotea bubble tea shop. They offer a wide selection of fruit teas and bubble teas, but most of them are above $4 even for the regular size, so you would have to pay some extra because your $4 drink pass isn't enough to cover the cost. Quality of the drinks are alright, thought I was never a fan of Presotea in general. Also, I don't think you could earn Vicinity points for buying drinks here."}
{"text":"One of the best escape games I've been to. Very well done with good amount of intrigue and gadgets. Friendly staff. Though I must say they may want to think about getting someone else to record their intro videos and clues... the Chinese accent takes away from the spookiness of the themes."}
{"text":"If you love board games, bubble tea and escape rooms. This is the place to come. Has everything packed in one space. I gave it 5 stars for that reason. I've been to 3 other escape places before and this is completely different. Did not expect them to having these fancy contraptions. Clues flowed (been to some places where clues didn't make sense). They're on the pricier side but you can get the package (1 escape room pass + unlimited board game pass + one bbt) for about $35. I would just come for the board games and bbt. Staff are really friendly too!"}
{"text":"As a Room Escape place, they are pretty good. As a Board Game place - they are, also, pretty good.,  So as a room escape, Omescape is pretty good as they are part of an international franchise - Currently they only have two adventures up and running, but supposedly will be up to 5 different scenarios up and running once they get up to full steam.   Currently, they have Joker's Asylum and Kingdom of Cats and while Joker's Asylum is supposedly harder - I'm not giving away spoilers. In comparison to the two previous escape rooms I've been to, the puzzles in this more are bit more in line with the overall theme of each room escape and definitely more of a logic oriented puzzle; so that is different. Now I think Joker's Asylum is probably best experience with 8 people rather than the 10 that we had, since with 10 people there wasn't enough to do for everyone.  The staff is very friendly and are pretty good with explaining everything at the start of the game, only thing is that we didn't get a debrief at the end - which would have been cool - since I would like to see the stats on it in comparison to other teams.  Boardgames - they have a good selection from Tokaido to the Resistance and there was plenty of room to sit down and play with largish groups. Plus the games were in excellent condition too, so that helps.  Food wise- it is kind of basic, with Presotea and Yogen Fruz on offer, with a smattering of the options (like 5 other items) but not too much to write home about.  Pricing for a room escape - it isn't the cheapest, but it isn't the most expensive either. I would recommend that you get their all in deal - which includes choice of 1 room escape with a 3.99 token for a beverage at Presotea (tax not included) and the all night unlimited play board games token for about $40 (Friday night and weekend pricing) after taxes - but if you \"like\" and check in on facebook - you get about $5 off so over all not a bad deal.  Boardgames - the unlimited play pass is about $10 per person for all night long (until 2am) and comes with a token for a $4 small drink, bring about $1.50 to cover off the taxes and a bit; which isn't too shabby either. They, also, have cheap Tuesday's - which is 50% off the boardgame cover fee and still includes the drink. Also, it comes with in and out privileges.    They are a bit hidden from the street, so locate the Carmelina Italian Restaurant at Esna Park and Woodbine and drive around to the back of the building and Omescape is right there.  New to them is the stamp card - you come 10 times you get your 11th free game pass - But I think they have a similar one for the room escape too."}
{"text":"I've been to many escape rooms in Toronto and Markham and Omescape beats them all. To start off the parking is very limited. There is only like 10 spots.. But it's not a big deal because you can park on the other side where it's a shared parking between the other businesses. Anyways, this place offers bubble tea, board games, 3 video game stations, and 5 escape rooms (I wish they had more, like this post if you wish it too!) For the price you pay it's definitely WORTH IT. You have to book a room in advance online. Great booking system - no issues. Upon arrival, if you check in using one of their social media platforms you will receive $3 off. They have a variety of board games, a lot of seating space and as advertised on their website you get a free drink. However, I paid for an escape room and the additional price to play games but we were still charged for drinks.. (None of the staff told us the drink would be free.)  On a brighter note, the room we played was The Kingdom of Cats and it was such a cool and fun experience. It was definitely well designed, how to get the clues were very well thought of and definitely creative, and the quality was spot on. The room had two levels!! Oh, did I mention you get UNLIMITED clues. I was flabbergasted to hear that considering the places I've gone to offer only 1-2 clues.  Overall, I would recommend Omescape. You will have a fun time whether it's just playing games or escaping out of a room."}
{"text":"This review is for the entire venue and not just the escape rooms.  Staff: They are friendly but disorganized especially when it comes to a large group. It's chaotic and a long process when trying to pay with a big group individually.  Rooms: I did an Cats Kingdom and it was alright. It was nice because there was a variety of skills that were required to get out. But it was definitely not a good room in terms of pacing. Each task only required 2 maybe 3 people at best and everyone else was twiddling their thumbs (not because they wanted to, but because there's nothing to help with). Although they have some pretty neat technology, it didn't make up for the pacing of the room. Plus a couple of the clues were vague at best, whereas others were pretty straightforward.  Board games: Their selection is okay, but my family has more board games than they have. The retro consoles are only on certain tables and obviously people hog them even when they aren't playing them so it sucks in that regards. You get a drink voucher but only for the cheapest drink, otherwise you have to pay the difference.  My last note is that it is quite pricey for everything. Kudos to them for capitalizing on the space and location, but personally I have a hard time justifying paying to go to this place."}
{"text":"I'd say out of 6 different escape game venues that I've been to, this would be my top 2 favourite venues to go to. The challenges are creative and flowed very well with the  game. Props and effects are very well done. My friends and I had the best time. I highly recommend it. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We booked for the penitentiary and was quite excited until we came across a binocular that would not focus, a broken remote control, some shitty flash lights and a broken power cord that was suppose to open three of the doors including the door to escape. We were not compensated with extra time nor some money back."}
{"text":"Omescape Marham has Escape rooms, a relatively spacious area for boardgames, and bubble tea/snacks (fries etc.) with YogenFruz (frozen yogurt).  I've done the Penitentiary, Joker's Asylum, Dark altar, Project Sphere (Mysterious Study) here, and I love the idea that we get separated into two small groups to play these escape rooms --- you'd really have to balance your teams well since both groups need to work together to solve the puzzles!  Another thing I like about Joker's Asylum is that because there are two separate rooms to start off from, Omescape staff told me that even though we solved the puzzle, I can still come back with a different group of friends to redo the room, as long as I let the staff member know so they can put me into the room I have not done. For an escape room addict like me who has been afraid of running out of rooms to play, having this option was a bonus for me!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of escape rooms and have done over 30 escape rooms in Toronto/Mississauga/Markham. Omescape was the first place our group did Escape Rooms at the beginning of the fad. Their rooms are well crafted and designed with lots of technology behind it. I would consider as a premium escape room and would pay $25-30 for the rooms. Omescape sets high expectations for the Escape Room industry and I would recommend them to anyone who are interested in Escape Rooms."}
{"text":"The staff here are so eager to please that it's kind of cute - they're eager to make sure everyone enjoys their experience! I came here for a fun board games night, so next time I hope to try one of the Room Escapes. I wish they offered more comfortable seating, but I guess that's pretty typical with these places. Perhaps they could add a few cushions?   The board game pass for $10 isn't bad, especially since you can redeem it partially for a drink. Note that alcohol isn't served here."}
{"text":"Omescape is around the back behind the seafood place (Diana's) so if you see that place, go in that parking lot.  It's in a bit of a weird spot.  The staff working there are very good at explaining what you need to do but they do seem a little disorganized.  They took a while to get around to our group too.  I went with three friends and we did The Kingdom of Cats.  I was very impressed with this and very much recommend it to anyone who is a fan of escape rooms.  The room was amazing and it was a ton of fun.  I would also say that it was perfect for four people, as well as being not too hard or easy.  They also take a picture of your group at the end - and you can use various props to make your picture look pretty!  They have a section for board games, if you like that, which also comes with a drink voucher (though, if you buy a cheaper one than it's valued at, you lose the excess).  Their game selection is pretty good and they're also in very good condition.  You can also buy snacks but they are a bit on the expensive side.  Honestly, the place is really nice and, literally the only thing keeping from giving them the 5 star is the price.  I do recommend giving this place a try if you're into escape rooms and / or board games."}
{"text":"Board game + escape room concept in Markham! Downtown finally doesn't get it all to themselves. And I like the place a lot.   Haven't done any of the escape rooms, but their board game concept is great. You pay a fixed $, a certain amount of $ goes to the credit for a $5 (i think) drink where it's owned by presto and yogen fruz. Yum!   Definitely not a first date kind of place. Go with a group of friends and enjoy the board games which are usually 4+ ppl.   Love how they set up this place, lots of room to put your coat, walk around without bumping into other people or other things."}
{"text":"By far one of the best escape rooms I have ever been to! I played Kingdom of Cats and we failed very close to the end, but it was very impressive!   I've also come here for the day pass to play board games. There are quite a few tables and some video games as well. The pass includes a small drink from Presotea or a small frozen yogurt from Yogen Fruz. Not a bad deal with this inclusion. I can see this being a very busy spot during evenings and weekends. There isn't much food here and not much nearby either, but the great thing is if you buy the pass, you can get a hand stamp and leave to grab food and come back! Pretty awesome!   I don't think they have the greatest selection of games but they do have several classics (Jenga, Monopoly, Connect Four, etc.) , as well as things like regular playing cards.   I'd think that the combination of the all day pass as well as an escape room would be a great value. I'd definitely come here with a few friends to hang out, play some games, do an escape room.   Kinda pricey, but I'd say it's worth it for the most part! Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Omescape is definitely one of the better escape game locations found in Markham. We tried the Joker's Asylum room and it was very challenging. The best part of this room is that your group is split into two rooms and you communicate to each other through and intercom.  The atmosphere of this place is very casual and you can play board games, video games or have a bubble tea before or after you do a room escape.  This place is a little pricier but you can save $5 if you check in on Facebook or Yelp. While convenient having a Presotea inside, I found the quality of drinks to be quite mediocre. I had a Milky Mango drink and it was way too sweet despite asking for less sugar. They made the drink twice for me and it was still too sweet.  Definitely go for the room escape. Go somewhere else for the bubble tea!"}
{"text":"This place has a few escape rooms and board games! I've only came here for board games and they have a great selection of board games. Even though it's kind of pricy, we paid $20 each. But, at least it came with a free drink or yogurt! The board game area is pretty big and composes of very long picnic-style tables so it could sit many groups of people. Haven't heard any issues of anybody not being able to find space. And if you can't find space, you can always jump into the escape rooms!  This place was the first time trying Dead of Winter, which is an amazing game, and makes me consider purchasing it for myself. I can imagine they just have a plethora of games to try here!  I'll definitely be back to try the escape rooms and see how it compares to other places. After that, I shall update this review!"}
{"text":"Not worth coming here just for board games.   1) It's $11.25 to play (compared to $5 at Snakes and Lattes). It comes with $4 of drink credit, but drinks are $2 more than usual.   2) The amount of board games is very limited, there's only one big shelf, Snakes and Lattes has probably 5x the amount of board games. They don't have any duplicates so it's pretty hard to get a popular game.   3) There's no people walking around to explain the games to you."}
{"text":"Omescape is pretty interesting in the sense that is is a bbt boardgame shop but ALSO has escape rooms as well.   i only came for board games so I'm only giving a review on that portion of the business. although i've heard that one of the escape rooms they have has moving walls. maybe i'll verify some day.  there are a lot of different board games here. some that i really want to try out, such as the Game of Thrones and Marvel ones. To play board games u need to purchase the board game pass which is $10 +tax i think? and then there's the drink token that lets u get a drink up to the value of $4 and anything more you just pay the difference for.  I had the blue berry, aloe vera, basil seed drink. They were out of basil seeds though so they substituted that with jelly with my consent of course.  not somewhere you want to stay for too long though because the wooden benches tend to hurt your ass after a while. this is something they could easily fix though."}
{"text":"Omescape Markham is a hybrid gaming/escape room establishment, with a Preso tea (bubble tea) built inside. The lobby is a wide and clean area with multiple tables for board games as well as Nintendo video games (including Mario Kart). There are available packages that include a bubble tea drink, access to board games, and an escape room (which can be further discounted by social media check-ins). Omescape is one of the big three (establishments with premium production values, elevating the genre well beyond simple rooms with combination locks, boxes, and papers) escape room establishments I would not hesitate to recommend to those interested in escape rooms (the other two being Mayze and Escape Games Canada). Here, my group successfully escaped Project Sphere, the Penitentiary, and the Dark Altar.   Overall, we greatly enjoyed our experiences navigating through multiple rooms with cleverly designed puzzles. Where this place struggles slightly compared to the two aforementioned places is continuity and immersion. That is, there is a larger reliance on literal clues (laminated manuscripts/cards), though it should be noted that there is no significant shortage of puzzles on other media. Moreover, in comparison to the others, it was confusing as to which puzzle/solution corresponded to which lock/door for some of the rooms, leading to precious time being wasted to untangle the logistics. As well, Omescape depends more heavily on combination locks than the other two, though not off-puttingly so.  Minor flaws aside, this place comes highly recommended. My group and I will return to finish the rest of the rooms, and look forward to new rooms as well as trying our hands at the Scarborough branch."}
{"text":"Came here this past Saturday on recommendation of a friend, and was pretty impressed. Omescape is an amalgamation of an escape room place, a board-gaming place, and a bubble-tea shop.   This concept is pretty genius if you ask me - start off with some high-energy escape challenge, then relax with some bubble-tea and board-games. Well, the board-gaming might not be so 'relaxing' depending on what game you're playing and who you are playing with haha, as evidenced by my group's board game-play.   Didn't get the chance to actually try the escape room activities, but I am intrigued after seeing what they had to offer. Lots of board game options, and a decent amount of BBT choices. The place offers a combo deal of sorts which includes entry to the board-gaming area plus one drink - keep in mind though that you have to pay an upgrade charge though if you wish to have a drink beyond the small basic drink (which I'm guessing most people end up doing)."}
{"text":"Without giving too much away about the rooms, I just got to say that these rooms are very well designed, challenging and the overall production is very well done.  The staff are very friendly, enthusiastic and they explain the rules of the game thoroughly. You're offered unlimited hints throughout the game, where as other escape-it places only offer 2-3. But keep in mind, these rooms are way more challenging.  This place also offers unlimited board game play as well as bbt drinks and yogen fruz, which I feel is a really good concept compared to other places. Although on the more pricy side, it's about $28 after tax and $5 discount for just the escape room and about $32-35 for a package of escape room, bbt, and board game play.  Definitely a fun place to hang out with a group of friends.  The only down side about this place is that the bbt drinks are not good...and they can definitely have a wider selection of board games to choose from."}
{"text":"Omescape is probably my favourite escape room place, and I'm not just saying that because it's the only place I've actually managed to escape from LOL. It is a little bit on the pricier side ($25 on weekends after the FB check-in discount), but the rooms are very high quality and have some neat features (i.e. doors sliding open automatically... each escape room consists of multiple components/rooms/areas) which enhance the overall experience. They also have an area with board games/game consoles and you can add an extra $4 which will entitle you to a $4 drink/food credit and unlimited board game play, which is pretty neat.  The two rooms I did were Kingdom of Cats and the Mysterious Study. Kingdom of Cats was my absolute favourite obviously because it was adorably cat-themed, but I thought both games were well-done (again, the decor/room features were great) and all of the tasks in the room were very reasonable and doable. My group of 4 managed to escape the Kingdom of Cats, but struggled a bit more with the Mysterious Study (honestly this is supposed the be the easiest room, but we were just being super dumb.) We were on the last task when our time was up though, so one of the staff members was nice enough to just let us keep working on it while the employees cleaned up the rest of the room and in the end we did figure it out and technically did escape... but I really appreciated that!  They have a great variety of board games, and will let you sit here for hours on end playing to your heart's content. Plus the N64 console is a nice throwback. Bubble tea isn't anything special to rave about, and they have Yogen Fruz which is standard, but be warned that they don't have a lot of food options (basically they have instant noodles, nachos, and one other thing, I forget), so consider eating elsewhere. But otherwise it's an awesome place to just come and chill, there's honestly something for everyone to do here :D"}
{"text":"I am so blown away by my escape room experience here! Definitely 5/5 for the escape room! The story line, creativity, puzzles, patters, clues, technology, and environment are amazing! I'm very impressed as I didn't expect this level of sophistication for an escape room. I've been to other escape rooms and this is definitely the most impressive and has spoiled other escape room centres in the future.   We did the Dark Alter room which was the second easiest in term of difficulty and all members of our team were fully immersed in the experience.   While the front desk is slightly inefficient in terms of check in but it's definitely worth it to do the full package to get an unlimited board game pass and one free prestotea bubble tea drink while you wait for your escape room scheduled time. If you check in on social media you can also get $5 off the package. They also have frozen yogurt for those those who want snacks.   Definitely recommend to everyone to do it and will most definitely be returning."}
{"text":"The room escape craze is well established in Markham, and Omescape is one of my highest recommended places. This review is quite late on my part; our team and I have completed all of their rooms and have numerously came for their board game Tuesdays for a cheap $7~ which includes a drink.   Establishment: It's huge. They have a front counter, a Presotea and Yogen Fruz bar, a large dedicated board game area, game cubes, a stage, and on top of that, about 5 escape rooms as well. It's clean, quite modern, and super spacious.  Escape Games: Really good quality rooms. They all have a story, and the puzzles are very doable and make sense. They all have some sort of  technology, from moving bookcases, secret holes, and lasers, it's siiiiick. Some rooms require all 5 senses and all of them need your brain power. Although for that kind of tech, of course you have to pay for it, which is about $24 with tax. Make sure you check in, share their video on Facebook, and all that jazz to get the most amount of discounts. If you are that bothered by it, just delete the posts after, but save that money!  Board Games: They have a good selection. It's not the biggest I've seen but they have the classics and also a good selection of non mainstream games.  I have been going to Omescape for years and will continue to do so. Their service is quite good and the whole place has a cool vibe. They're a well oiled machine and they should just keep doing what they do! 5/5"}
{"text":"I have been to many escape games around Toronto and this one is by far the best escape game location !!  Their game set ups are super high tech and well thought out !!  What's even better is we can play a million kinds of board games  while we were served with snacks and drinks !!  I say this is an Amazing hang out place"}
