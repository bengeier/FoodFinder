{"text":"My girlfriend and I ordered delivery from Peking Express last night (Saturday night).    Delivery time was fine (no earlier or later than most restaurants), the delivery guy was nice and the food was warm to hot when it arrived (the warm being perfectly fine since it was cold out last night).  We did not enjoy the food.  The egg rolls were fried thick with little filling.  They did have crunch but were bland tasting.  They were not extraordinary by any means.    The chicken balls were massive balls of dough with miniscule amounts of meat.   The meat was dark meat.  Total disappointment.   Also, Peking Express offers chicken balls in quantities of six or 12 and unless you specify you want six, they will sell you 12 (for twice the cost).  That's my bad - we should have specified - but the chicken balls were still awful.  The lemon chicken was a large container filled with what must have been six chicken breasts (so keep in mind the quantity is huge when you're ordering other dishes).  The lemon chicken has a crunchy fry to it but, with respect to another poster who said in his/her post here, I would respectfully disagree in calling the chicken legendary - it was merely ordinary.   The lemon sauce comes on the side and we found to be mild and thin - I prefer it sweeter and tangy.    The black bean beef schezuan style had tasty beef but we found there was very little beef and green peppers relative to the large amount of onions.   The lo mein with veggies was your standard lo mein with veggies but it was quite greasy.  Overall, we were disappointed with the food.  We know Peking Express is not upscale or necessarily authentic Chinese food  but we found it ordinary, bland tasting and below average compared to other Canadian Chinese food restaurants in the city."}
{"text":"Going to start off by saying this is hands down my favourite place to order Chinese food in the whole city! No doubt the prices are amazing and the people who work there are all really friendly and love their customers.   I always order the same items: Chicken fried rice - simple and amazing, the rice never sticks and is always delivered hot warm and so delicious.  Egg rolls - they are really proud to serve them and they make them in-store I believe! Really delicious.  Chicken balls - OMG without a doubt the best chicken balls! The batter is not too heavy or too light. The chicken to batter ratio is about 50/50 which is perfect! The chicken inside is always juicy and seasoned! Chicken wings - simply deep fried and delicious.  Lemon chicken - chicken is a must the batter is thick BUT very very crispy tasty batter, the sauce is decent but the chicken itself is legendary.   This place is a Westernized Chinese food place, yeah it's gonna be greasy but coincidentally this place just nails it. Never have I received an order where there was a tone of grease in the boxes.  It is hands down the best in Toronto for your Chinese fix. Also they have 5 cent specials where you can order a whole dish if you spend a certain amount.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed. Just received takeout - the szechuan beef was all onion (yet $12.99), the chicken balls were mostly bread and sketchy looking meat, and the spring rolls tasted (and looked) like Thai Express' mass produced, under cooked rolls (but 4x the price of theirs).    Its my fault though as I moved neighbourhoods, placing myself out of reach of New Ho King's delicious delivery.   P.S. Peking, would love my 50 bucks back!"}
{"text":"This is our go to Chinese delivery place. Delivery is always fast, seriously sometimes  like 15 minutes fast, and fresh. I always get the Cantonese Lo-Mein, which is delicious with toasted noodles. Definitely big enough for sharing. Husband usually gets \"traditional\" fare of chicken balls, wings and rice. Which are also good, not as greasy as some other places. And the egg rolls, I don't know what it is, but I've never had better."}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese take out in the city!! Everything on their menu tastes amazing !! Their egg rolls are the best i have EVER had also their shanghai noodles are so tasty as well as the lemon chicken and general george chicken! Would highly recommend for take out or delivery!!! Prices are good and so are the portions !!!!!"}
{"text":"Don't do it. The food omg the texture of the sweet and sour spare ribs is so disgusting I didn't know what I was eating I had to spit it out. The chicken is so salty and doesn't taste like chicken. Overall I will never ever eat here again..."}
{"text":"Outside of the excellent delivery time this meal was nothing short of tragic. Stringy beef, chicken of the lowest grade, pork which was little more than breaded and sauced cartilage chunks.   The meal was essentially inedible.  Positives... outside of the delivery speed (which again we appreciated) would be... the wonton soup was decent (three stars) and the egg role was edible (two stars)."}
{"text":"Worst Chinese delivery I have ever got. Food arrived in a small bowl size for $12-$15 each. Delivery took 45min and had no sauce or utensils. Food was poorly seasoned and some vegetables were raw in stirfry."}
{"text":"I ordered food on Just Eat - worst $60 order of my life. Avoid this place!  What we got:  - Small quantity of food  - Bland taste  - NO UTENSILS IN THE BAG, like how do you forget utensils and napkins during take-out?  - We even gave a nice 15% tip beforehand... regret doing this."}
{"text":"Possibly the worst Chinese food I've had in decades. Greasy, bland, barely edible. At least the delivery was speedy and correct."}
{"text":"We ordered for the first time from Peking Express after reading the reviews right here on Yelp.  Delivery was free...BONUS!  The food was great and the delivery guy was super cool and patient (gf couldn't find cash).  Will go back for sure."}
{"text":"I used to eat here when I was living on Shuter Street..I ordered for convenience and not the taste.. it was OK.. but nothing special... I found the egg rolls to be not very good."}
{"text":"Very impressed with the food from here. Tried the lemon chicken which had a not too sweet lemon sauce and the Thai banana rolls that were everything I expected and more! Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Good Day: Thank you for reading my post, you will be glad that you did! Last evening I ordered from this \"hovel\" for the first time. I placed my order which did not arrive on time.  When 1 hour had passed I called the establishment.  They told me that it would be there soon. $40.00 dollars later I paid the driver for my bill and a generous gratuity to the driver.  He seemed uncomfortable delivering the food to me and I well understand why. When I opened the takeout bag with the food two large cockroaches scurried out of the bag! I cannot tell you how horrible it was!  I managed to kill one of the cockroaches and the other cockroach scurried into my kitchen! I cannot tell you what the food tasted because I put all of it in the trash. Govern your self accordingly with ordering from this \"hovel\". I did not want to eat cockroach in a sweet and sour sauce."}
{"text":"Wow, that was some tasty grease-laden food.    The Highlights:  - Lemon chicken (I'm imagining it was triple deep fried...in crack) - Singapore noodles (very tasty, but yes, greasy)  The Let Downs:  - Chili chicken (just some fried chicken pieces with some spicy mystery powder, do not order this one) - BBQ Pork (it looked steamed...can't recommend) - Thai Fried Rice (poorly mixed, there were big clumps of unseasoned rice in there)  If you're going to order from here, consider the first two and explore the menu a little deeper.  Needless to say, $45 here (incl delivery, not including tip) will feed two people for at least 3 meals."}
{"text":"The best (inexpensive) NA Chinese food in Toronto IMO My go to place for non soggy fatty honey garlic spare ribs.Though they are short, they clearly use back ribs, not fatty cheaper side ribs, and they are crispy. The other dishes are also classic old school NA chinese food choices, all done well. Delivery is so quick you'll think they cook it in the car on they way over. I would say avoid the egg rolls, but that's my only complaint. Is there better around the city? sure, but taking price into consideration you can't beat this place for (non authentic) Chinese food."}
{"text":"I stopped here today and sometimes you eat something and immediately regret it .... well that happened today there were hard things in it ... gristle or something oh well live and learn"}
{"text":"fast service and priced fairly reasonable. i should start giving good restaurants bad reviews and bad restaurants... good reviews. This way, I dont have to wait in line, but i wont. highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is the only place I will order for Chinese food.   1) It's a delicious grease plate of wonderful  2) It's fast. I mean you call in your order and 20 minutes later it's at your door 3) The delivery man is always so nice.  4) It's cheap!"}
{"text":"Found them through just-eat.ca  Awesome food, delivery on-time.  Lame delivery driver asked for his tip."}
{"text":"OMG! The Szechuan beef dish smelled like rotten flesh. I have a strong stomach so I thought lets taste it to see .. WOW! It melted in my mouth like it was predigested and tasted like sh__. I've never experienced anything this foul in my life .. disgusting! The management only offered me a credit and had no explanation whatsoever. Since I will never eat from this fine establishment ever again, they get to keep my credit. What a nightmare .. I don't even know if I was eating beef or something imitating beef"}
{"text":"I had guest over and wanted Chinese , so took a chance on Peking Express once again. My order was about $70 plus . I was pleasantly surprised . The food was actually fresh my last review of Peking Express was not a good one . But tonight I think they upped their game and actually scored. I think there maybe hope and maybe have concentrated more on quality. Everything was good , my guest were happy so... I hope that that quality continues , prices have gone up a bit, but what hasn't   . Don't mind if we are receiving quality , and freshly  made food ......."}
{"text":"Since I first wrote my disappointing review,  I decided to try Peking Express just one more time as I keep getting their flyers in my mail box and as I said in my last review, I do remember this place as being a friendly family run restaurant which at one time, years ago, was great.  However, the food is now worse than ever and  I see that others have experienced the same. Peking Express has become such a disappointment over the years which is really too bad because it is Cabbagetown.   But, I have to say, save yourself the money, the food is now absolutely dreadful!  The owners don't seem to care anymore and I hope they read this!"}
{"text":"Great portions, good food for your average msg filled Chinese food place... It's our go to for when you're craving that. But my husband and I always feel the msg hangover the next day."}
{"text":"I've just lost confidence in Yelp.  Ordered for delivery. Arrived without chopsticks. Hot and Sour Soup looked weird. Crispy noodles were mushy. Kung Pao chicken was pretty weak at best.  Will not order from Peking Express again."}
{"text":"Ordered some take out from this place and I ordered the following three dishes Lemon Chicken: Lemon sauce good chicken was OK. Emperor Beef (Hot): Not hot enough IMO lots of veggies  Sweet and Sour Prawns: were surprisingly still pipping hot when I got them. 8 good sized pieces (mostly batter)  Portion size  ranged from OK (Beef) to generous (chicken) Food is typical Americanized version i.e. lotsa batter on fried items. You do feel heavy after eating the food but I guess that's the idea.  Service was great as I got a call from them half and hour before delivery that might be running late due to the rush hour even though they delivered on time. If I want my greasy Chinese fix this is the place I would call."}
{"text":"I had the orange chicken with a second side of sweet & sour sauce. I felt there wasn't enough \"Orange\" taste and the \"mild\" was a bit too spicy for me. Other than that, the meal was great!!"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery them when I was in no mood to cook.  I got the Lemon Chicken and some eggplant in oyster sauce.  The lemon chicken was full of thick and juicy strips, with a not overly sweet lemon sauce. The lemon grass was a nice touch to the sauce.  The eggplant dish was just right, it was not overcooked and mushy like how so many places screw it up.    The deliver was free and arrive in about 40 minutes.  I kept their flyer on hand for future episodes of laziness."}
{"text":"* when I called they told the hot and sour soup is vegetarian and it came with meat.. * too much oily * HAIR WAS ON THE SOUP.. WORST FOOD I EVER HAD IN MY LIFE"}
{"text":"By the neighborhood that this is found in, you wouldn't expect too much, but it's actually very good food. The take out menu says 'How long has it been since you had a proper egg roll?'. In the case of Peking Express, it IS fairly high quality. The filling and sauce are actually quite tasty. The chicken almond guy doing is very tasty, as are the American standards such as chicken balls and fried rice. Combo specials are well priced and the service is friendly. Has daily specials of you order above $30 of food. Check it out"}
{"text":"I wonder if they are under new ownership as this place used to be okay.  We ordered a mixture of Chinese and Thai items off the menu.  The Pad Thai (spelling it Phad Thai on the menu should have tipped us off, maybe) that was the worst I have had in Toronto.  There was almost no seasoning to it, seemed like plain noodles with watered down ketchup and vinegar on it with the other items thrown on top but no seasoning at all.  Chinese mixed veg were just plain steamed veg, not sauteed with a nice sauce as is usual. MaPo Tofu was not MaPo Tofu but some other Tofu dish totally unlike the soft stew that is customarily the dish.  You needed a microscope to see the dry garlic spare-ribs that we bought as an appetizer.  The only dish that was okay was General George chicken.  We won't be ordering from this place very soon again."}
{"text":"Poor services & food:  - no chopstick/forks - no napkins - no rice - the food is overpriced: e.g., the description was misleading - got a small finger size sausage that cost $3.5+tax/service fee"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery. It took 50 minutes for the food to arrive, and when we received the delivery, there were no forks, spoons, and napkins. The flavour and the serving size compared to the price was extremely poor. There are definitely plenty of other places in Toronto where you can receive twice as much food (that taste better) for half the price.     ."}
{"text":"One of the better Chinese take-out places in Toronto. I love their lemon chicken and wonton soup! I used to order the pad thai a lot, but I think the recipe changed in the past few years and I'm not a fan of this new version. Very easy to order online, but the one time I ordered over the phone I had a very friendly and helpful staff member take the order, so that was a pleasant experience. Some of their food is a bit strange (the sweet and sour ribs made me feel nauseous after eating a few bites), but mostly yummy. Good place to try if you're craving Chinese takeout!"}
{"text":"So yesterday was my birthday and i mentioned that it was in the delivery instructions immediately i get a call from the restaurant wishing me a Happy Birthday . they also made me a special meal witch was awesome plus the delivery guy  wishes me a happy Birthday !! made my day ,,love this place love the food ..Peking express for life !!"}
{"text":"I've been ordering from this place for years! Great food- always very fresh and amazing. Best sweet and sour pork ribs in the city and the egg rolls are amazing! Portion sizes are huge and the owner and staff are great.They always go above and beyond to ensure your satisfaction! Highly recommend this place, especially when your hanging out with friends and want to order loads of flavour!"}
{"text":"Not great, but if you do a walk in and you take out one of their specials posted on their wall, it is fresh and tasty.  Specifically I ordered the Shanghai noodles.  It's fast and fairly priced.  A culinary masterpiece, no.  But somehow satisfying."}
{"text":"When I lived in the area this was my go-to dirty feed place. It's good old greasy Chinese food at a good price.  The menu is a decent size and has a range of options for everyone. As with most places like this, there is a discount if you pay cash. I don't think I've used their delivery service (maybe once?), but every time I've gone in here the staff have been good.  It isn't fancy, but the food is good and will fill you with all the regret you want after gorging yourself.  Nov. 30-day challenge 36/30"}
{"text":"The *only* place where we order from is The Peking Express.  Love their food and daily specials.  Food was fresh, real, veggies were nice and crisp, and overall very tasty.  :)"}
