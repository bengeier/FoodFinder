{"text":"We love this place and go practically every weekend. A family-run place with great food right in our neighbourhood - perfect."}
{"text":"Conversation had: 
''Hey where do you want to eat breakfast' 
'I dunno'
'You?'
'Wherever, I'm easy'
'That helps'
'Edmonton trail?'
'Nah, not again, let me check Yelp'. I have this conversation every weekend to some degree.
Thankfully because I had my fancy new iPhone with me, I was able to find with 
Yelp's help (haha), a place called John's Breakfast and Lunch. And John' s does exactly that, serves breakfast and lunch. It's a small place in Mount Pleasant, and because of this you can actually get street parking and don't  face a lineup.
The staff were efficient and friendly and though not talkative were always there to refill the coffee and water when needed. Surprising since they all appeared to be under the age of 21, and that demographic and the word customer service don't usually go hand in hand from most of my own experiences.
Anyways, about the food. Standard breakfast fare, good size portions I couldn't finish, and breakfast for under $12 per person. How can you complain. 
The only thing I will mention is DO NOT park in front of the grocery store beside John's. The older lady owner came out failing her hands that we were parking- in- spots- for- 'her'- customers- and -we -give- out- business- to- them- and- not- her- so- she- can't- pay- her- bills. I think it's more to do with her shoddy shop with a dying plant in the main window. Anyways this lady is bat shit crazy and another patron walking into Johns flipped her the bird when she went off on him  Although I always love me some free entertainment so I hope to see her again."}
{"text":"John's is a great little spot for those who woke up late on the weekend, are starving and dont want to wait 30 minutes for a table and another 30 for food. No frills, they have a basic breakfast menu, typical lunch stuff (burgers, sandwiches etc..) and alos a small selection of asian dishes (won ton soup, spring rolls..)
The service was fast and efficient, the food decent. I had eggs, hashbrowns, toast and a pancake on the side. I thought the price of the pancake was a bit steep at $3 for one, but it was huge. 
A friend ordered poutine, which turned out to be the McCain's fries with curds and a thick gravy. The won ton/wor won ton soup though that were ordered at the table looked fantastic.  The soup had a generous helping of veg and dumpling and the broth smelled amazing.
John's is definitely a great place to have in the back pocket, for lazy mornings."}
{"text":"This place is quite the hidden gem. I've been here a few times, and every meal I've tried has been great! If there is a lineup to get in, it's never been too long of a wait to be seated. I highly recommend John's!"}
{"text":"Came in Saturday morning. It was busy. The place is really small. Decor is simple but the food is delicious. Had the eggs benny. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Just came back from breakfast here - first time visitor.  Really good:
Parking - out front, 2 hour parking, also along side streets.  Location is on 4th street right beside Karouzo's pizza (which sadly is no longer open).
Service - very friendly, efficient, checks on customers and refills coffee frequently while respecting privacy.  Turnaround from order to food delivery very quick.
Food - tried their all-day breakfast, very good.  They also mega-omelette selection.  We also tried the french toast which comes with their AWESOME (5-star) homemade hash browns.  My recommended breakfast plate for next time:  French toast (w/ the hash browns) and side of sausage.  The ham and bacon were OK, nothing outstanding, but the sausage was sliced and fried to a crispy finish - Yum.  Coffee was also a very nice smooth medium roast.
Rest of menu was cafe fare:  burgers / fries / veal cutlets, etc. with a couple of Vietnamese dishes (spring rolls, vermicelli).
Overall - bright and clean neighborhood cafe, there were tables of young and older folks who were regulars, even policemen in the back at their regular spot.  Very relaxed vibe."}
{"text":"Asian family owned and located close to 16 ave and centre north, this place has great breakfast food, burgers and even some Asian dishes that all hit the spot! Having just moved to the area, I have to say I am very happy to have this place nearby! Good food, good prices, I will return again and again. Upgrade side of fries/hash browns to poutine!"}
{"text":"It was busy, but we didn't have to wait for a table and the service was excellent.  My mother ordered eggs benedict and I got the two eggs breakfast - poached soft.  It was all cooked perfectly.  John's homemade, hashbrowns are the best.  The serving size was large - neither of us finished our meals.   Strong coffee - excellent!

It's an open kitchen; we watched as John quickly prepared the plates - the whole place is spotless.
 
Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I accidentally came across John's Breakfast and Lunch when I was on my way home from the Safeway Liquorstore. I had never seems or heard of it before and decided to go after looking up the good reviews on yelp! I made plans to go for brunch the following weekend. 

I would definitely go here again. The prices are on the cheap side and the decor is dated but it's not as bad as I was expecting based on others reviews. 

I had the eggs benny which I will not order again. It was OK but the hollandaise sauce tasted like it came out of a package. The price was so reasonable, though, that I didn't feel too ripped off. The hash browns were delish!! And the waitresses are definitely prompt on the coffee refills which I looove! 

My friends had some of the omelets which looked fantastic! They were stuffed with lots of fillings! I will have those next time. 

Overall, it's a quaint and cheap little breakfast/lunch joint that I will definitely o to again sometime real soon! A little gem in Calgary!"}
{"text":"We always go to this lil restaurant for breakfast. It's not fancy, but it is always consistent and good. The food is basic but tasty and you get a great portion size for the price. For a greasy spoon type restaurant it's always clean. And the coffee is good :)"}
{"text":"Traipsing into John's at 10am on a Saturday isn't as bad as I thought it would be, we only had to wait about 15 mins for a table for 4.

It's not often that I crave a burger, so I wanted to satisfy that hunger with a cheeseburger. (Although the eggs benny omelette our friend ordered looked pretty tasty!) Set up diner style, our food was out quite fast and they run a tight ship here. People don't linger, which might explain why it only took us 15 mins get get a table unlike other breakfast/brunch joints (you know who you are!)

$10 for a large homemade burger with crinkle fries? Steal of a deal if you ask me!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast.  Family operation.  Watching the owner cook was impressive.  I'd go back in a heartbeat if I'm ever back in Calgary."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our breakfast we had here about a month ago. Obviously a family run establishment, the waitress was very friendly and attentive, the food was good and it was very reasonably priced. Solid breakfast joint where the food and service is good!"}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast joint. Huge servings of food at low prices. Delicious, friendly servers, decent coffee. I usually eat omelettes here and  they are generous with the ingredients - omelettes are always stuffed with the goodies, very fresh."}
{"text":"Just wanted to update this to 5 stars. I don't give out 5 stars very often, but for the number of times I've brought friends and family here and the number of times I recommend it and gush about it, I think it deserves 5 stars."}
{"text":"I ordered Eggs and 1 pancake. It was really yam and affordable!! This place is AWESOME!!"}
{"text":"Came here a few times breakfast is always fast and delicious. Especially the Eggs Benny and French Toast."}
{"text":"Wendy, John, and the Girls are great. Perfect food and brilliant service. These people really get eggs, and the omelettes are incredible."}
{"text":"Once in a while my boyfriend and I will wake up and decide that we want to go for breakfast. We usually sit there for a good 20 min scrolling through business listings trying to find a new place to go, but not wanting to risk going to a breakfast place that we don't like, we normally end up at the same place. As I'm searching for places to go for breakfast, John's Breakfast and Lunch always pops up. I always consider trying it out, but for some reason or another never end up going. 

A couple days ago however, we decided it was time to try this place out. We went on a monday morning around 10:00. It was only a 5 minute drive from our place, and there is free parking all around which is always a bonus. There weren't a lot of people when we got there, im assuming because it was a monday morning, and we got seated quickly. You can either sit on the patio outside or inside - we decided to sit inside. The inside of the restaurant was very clean and pleasant looking.  

Our server was very friendly and attentive. My boyfriend got the 2 eggs with sausage, scrambled eggs, and white toast, while I had the benedict omlette with whole wheat toast. Both of our meals were delicious. The portions were very generous and left both of us feeling full. Not only that, the price of our meals was very reasonable. I believe our total (without tip) came to just under 20$."}
{"text":"Have been here dozens of times. Good simple breakfasts. Amazing family running it. So friendly. Blazing fast service."}
{"text":"Great breakfast food. Tastes homemade. Bacon isn't greasy and the pancakes are fluffy. The staff are very friendly. Would go again without a doubt."}
{"text":"John's is what it is and it doesn't try to be anything more. And what they is? Solid. That's what they is!

John's Breakfast and Lunch is quiet looking and unassuming, like a small diner you might find in a small town. And the real deal at that; John's doesn't look like a diner trying to look like a diner you might find in a small town. Are you following along so far?

I ordered a mushroom burger and shoved it in my face with gusto. I'm blown away with the food quality at John's; nothing fancy and everything tasty. It's a solid, juicy, sloppy burger and that's that. 

There are no pretentious descriptions of your ground beef's lineage, and I'm not sure if the grains used in the flour was played soothing music to encourage a positive harmonious harvest. I'm not saying it isn't, but I am saying it's really tasty. 

As my grandpa would tell me, \"The real tough guys don't need to prove to everyone they're tough.\" This is Johns. Unassuming and damn good at what they do. Pretty sure my grandpa would have liked this place."}
{"text":"Average eggs Bennie , muffin soft ie previously toasted and very tough to cut even with a knife 

Eggs done right, nice ham, potatoes a little raw

$13 with tip and a bottle of water"}
{"text":"We checked this place out thanks to yelp's recommendation. Service was very prompt and attentive and the food was pretty tasty. I had the eggs Benedict and my boyfriend had the French toast. Both meals were generously portioned and well prepared. If it were closer by we would probably come back more often but if you're in the area this is a great spot to get breakfast without any hipster lineups"}
{"text":"Not much to look at but quick, friendly, tasty and great size of breakfast for good value. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"This is a family owned restaurant/diner with a very homey feel.  Once you walk in, you are greeted promptly by Wendy (John's wife.  John is the guy who's busy cooking...) or one of her daughters.  There are a lot of regulars that eat here and this space can get pretty full.  Fortunately, the owners know how to turn tables quickly. 
Their specialties include omelettes, eggs Benny, burgers, poutines, sandwiches and several Vietnamese dishes (spring roll, won ton soup).
Our server, Anita, was friendly and attentive. No matter how busy she was, she would always check on your table and give you coffee/hot water refills even before you thought of asking her.    If you're not a coffee/tea fan, they also serve delicious, creamy, milkshakes (strawberry, vanilla, and chocolate) at a reasonable price (less expensive compared to Carl's Jr.)
My son's favourites (so far) are the poutine (deliciously rich gravy with soft cheese curds) and the Benedict omelette.   Hubby just loves their eggs Benedict--the eggs are poached perfectly every time.  My favourite is their BMC omelette, which is filled with smoky bacon, earthy mushrooms and Cheddar cheese, served with hash browns and toast."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my first experience here, it reminds me of the old rural diners I would go to as a kid. Comfort food, clean restaurant with friendly service. I had the hot hamburger sandwich for lunch on a cold day and thoroughly enjoyed it. They also had a very nice looking fresh omelette for special under $10. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"everything has an egg in it for breakfast, and the rest of the menu is bland as bland can be.  I wonder who came up with the idea at johns breakfast, that if it has an egg, its breakfast."}
{"text":"Think:  huge bowl of wor wonton soup; huge plate of french toast, bacon & hashbrowns; awesome bacon burger & fries; and a hearty bacon & cheese omelette...all in one place - everyone is happy! 

The variety of the menu is perfect. Everything from Vietnamese spring rolls to BLTs. The service is prompt, cheerful and friendly. Refills of tea and coffee are frequent.

John's is casual, pretty much a mom & pop joint, which I totally love. Nothing pretentious here.

You can tell there's regulars that come in to write and eat, meet and eat -  having regulars is a pretty good indication that a place is worth eating at. I will now be a regular.

We visited around 1 p.m. In the afternoon on a Saturday.  Check hours and days before you go as a sign said they are closed on Sundays currently."}
{"text":"This is such a great little breakfast spot. The food was delicious, huge portions for the price, friendly service, and hot coffee. No frills, no gimmicks, just good food."}
{"text":"Nice cozy place with great food! If you are looking for a fancy place, this is not the place for you. But if you are looking for great quality and generous portions this is the place! I had the benedict omelet and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"You always need a good breakfast before you start an adventure day.  Today's adventure day happened to be on a Saturday usually its Sundays. This worked out well for us because we had a chance to try John's because John's is not open Sundays.  A little bit inconvenient as it's a breakfast place and hangover breakfast is always on a Sunday. 

Never the less this place was packet we must have waited 20 to 30 minutes to get a seat.  We were seated outside watching all the people line up the people just kept coming some didn't stay too long of a wait. 
The Server promptly brought us coffee and kindly told us that she apologizes  in advance that they are really busy today and if we are interested in pancakes that they will take longer than normal because of something to do with the griddle. I thought this was really respectful of her to provide us a heads up.  I didn't want pancakes I wanted eggs. 

Our orders arrive nothing fancy. The one order was incorrect but was promptly amended she knew it was wrong right away and fixed it we did not have to say anything. Lovely!  I could tell that the kitchen was rushing as I found egg shells in my meal.  The food was good and I will probably return just because I experienced such good service even with the hiccups."}
{"text":"Can't believe I haven't tried this place as it is just around the corner. I had the eggs Benedict which was very good.  The hash browns were also tasty but could be crisper.  That is just personal prefereence though.

Service was prompt and friendly as well.

Will definitely come back again! :)"}
{"text":"A diamond in the rough! 

We drove up Edmonton Trail, only to be astounded at the line ups outside of the diners we really wanted to try. We found this place on the fly!

It's absolutely a dive on the inside, but we were seated immediately, the service was prompt (I was starving by this point), food was cheaper than most, and it was delicious. The hash browns are seasoned well, eggs were perfect, and the Benny was delicious.

Only downside was the decor. We were seated in the back, which is painted flouro green, tacky decorations, but the food and service make up for it! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place. Can be quite busy on weekends so prepare for a bit of a wait. Very reasonably priced. Try it out!"}
{"text":"John's serves good homemade, old fashioned breakfast. There's nothing fancy about their food and their personality, and that's why I keep going back. No, they don't do duck fat fries, or crab eggs benny. Everything is simple and delicious.

The prices are a bit cheaper than the usual brunch places in Calgary, and the wait isn't long, but could take up to 20-30 minutes during peak times.

The restaurant is family run and everyone is friendly. I think the older children of the owners wait the tables and are awkwardly honest. One time, when I had to pay upfront, the daughter, who was probably around 18-20 years old, quipped \"Sorry, we don't have a portable machine. We're Asian and cheap...\". I laughed.

Anyway, John's is the place to go to if you want to feel like family, awkward teenage children and all."}
{"text":"Got in around 11AM on a Friday; they were full again but we waited less than 5 minutes to get a table. I tried the Eggs Benny again to see if they're consistent. Service was friendly and efficient, like before. So we're back!"}
{"text":"Our first time at John's Breakfast & Lunch and it won't be our last!  We arrived a little after 8 a.m. on Saturday morning and managed to get a table.  We were immediately greeted by an Asian lady who promptly seated us down with our menus.  Then, we ordered our beverages of coffee and green tea.  I must say that the coffee here is very good.  I commented on the coffee to the lady in charge and she was quite pleased saying that she gets a lot of good comments about their coffee.  The coffee kept on coming!  

We ordered the following items for breakfast:
- French Toast with sausages & hasbrowns - really tasty.
- Western Ouellette - special of the day - with hasbrowns and brown toast - very good.
- Eggs Benedict - really, really soft poached eggs and that wonderful hollandaise sauce with hash browns.  

The hash browns is nice and soft and mushy yet slightly crispy on the outside.  Goes so well with ketchup!

The restaurant is on the small side, very clean with 2 M/F washrooms.  I can see their outside patio being a popular spot in the summer.  Looks like a family-run business.  Very interesting menu with western food and Vietnamese as well."}
{"text":"Everything is great. Make sure you get there early because it gets busy. Best classic breakfast in Calgary. Period."}
{"text":"Nothing spectacular, but fresh, fast, and wholesome breakfasts.

The service can be a little...\"efficient\", but the family-run feeling you get more than makes up for it.

I usually have the chorizo omlette with a side of bacon. Om nom nom."}
{"text":"It's Saturday morning. You wake up and think \"Man, I wish Calgary had a breakfast delivery service!\" Next, all of the currently popular breakfast spots run through your head and you groan at the thought of the lineup that has probably formed at each one already. Then you remember this neighbourhood you used to live in, Mount Pleasant. And you remember reading a couple of reviews for this place called John's Breakfast & Lunch. Mount Pleasant isn't the Beltline. There's a chance there won't actually be a lineup....

That was my Saturday morning monologue. Guess what? It was right! We walked into John's just before 11. We were the beginning of the line up. It took maybe another 5 minutes for a table to open up. Score!

The menu sports at least 8 different kinds of omelettes. I had the chorizo sausage one. Served with hash browns and toast, this folded pocket of eggy goodness was packed full of sausage and peppers. Did I mention it was, like, $8.95? Take that crappy chain breakfast spots. Breakfast is served all day long. The menu says lunch starts at 11... although our server said both were available all day. So, take your pick. Omelette, burger, bowl full of rice noodles and spring rolls? Yeah, that's right! There are two Vietnamese dishes on the menu as well. And those spring rolls? Impressively big and extra crunchy. I think they win my spring roll award.

It's nothing fancy. But it's good and filling food for price that's easy to swallow. The servers are friendly, and quick on the coffee refills. And you even get a fortune cookie with your bill. According to mine, \"An unexpected event will soon make your life more exciting.\" Guess I need another cookie to find out what it's gonna be!"}
{"text":"Came back again and had a lovely breakfast. Eggs were done just the way I ordered! Over medium. It was a perfect over medium !   Love the mom and pop feel. Great service."}
{"text":"John's breakfast and lunch is located on 4th street in the NW.  It's right across from fast lube.  There is street parking but it can get busy so you might have to do a bit of walking.  

If you've ever been to OEB then you will know what I mean when I say that the area is similar to OEB...very laidback on a semi quiet street but always busy.  When we arrived, I noticed that there is seating outside (6 tables) but we decided to take a seat inside.  We were greeted immediately and waited a short time as there was a couple ahead of us.  The place is pretty cozy; you can see the kitchen and display when you walk in.  We got seated and handed menus and ordered our drinks.  The menu has a nice variety ranging from typical breakfast choices, to wonton soup, to vietnamese vermicelli to burgers and sandwiches.  Okay, so it was around 2PM and I really wanted some breakfast and lunch selection so I decided to go with the eggs benny and a poutine.  My gf decided to go with the regular size wonton soup.  As we waited, a few more couples came in to dine.

First my eggs benny came then my poutine.  I was pretty stoked.  The poutine is crinkle cut fries topped with mozzarella cheese covered in gravy.  Then eggs benny looked delicious, ham, poached eggs on top of English muffin covered in hollandaise sauce sprinkled with parsley, what's not to love?  My gf's wonton soup looked great!!  She was sick so I snatched some vegetables and a dumpling before she dug in.  The vegetables were perfectly cooked and the dumpling was tasty.  They definitely didn't cheap out on the filling!!  My gf enjoyed her soup very much, even though she could only semi taste it and I enjoyed my crispy crinkle cut poutine and eggs benny.  I was so full, but when they're staring at you, you just have to eat every single bite!!  

There were two waitresses at the time and they are pretty much a team.  One can take your order, the other can fill your water and then one can bring your food out.  It's nice to see them coincide.  If either needs help, I'm sure they will have each other's backs!  Although busy, the waitresses were both very attentive, filling our water regularly and checking up on us to see if everything was fine.  

In my humble opinion, John's breakfast and lunch is totally a ma and pa joint.  We even got to meet the owners and they are super friendly!  I think John's breakfast and lunch is the place to go if you want brunch that is easy on the wallet, nothing fancy but totally tasty,  with friendly service!!!  Give these folks a try!!  I know I will be dining here again! 

Beware!  There may be longer waits on the weekends...but it is worth every second!"}
{"text":"Wanted to check it out in the summer. Mapped it out, drive there, but it was closed for a few weeks for summer holidays ..??!!   Haven't been back to check it out."}
{"text":"This feels like a small town establishment or something attached to a truck stop, and not in a bad way.  Good food, big portions and nothing fancy.  Don't even walk in the door if you're looking to impress your friends or family with something that feels upper crust.  John's is where down-to-earth, non-judgmental people go.  It actually looked weird to see one guy on a laptop.  It just doesn't seem like that kind of place where you'd hang out to work and have coffee.  I also noticed there wasn't a lot of ambient noise or a single child to interfere with a pleasant conversation.  

I ordered a pretty basic breakfast, being eggs over easy, bacon, toast and hash browns.  My friend asked for bacon well-done, so I said \"ditto.\"  I'd say everything was perfect.  The bread was toasted just right, the bacon was flat and crispy, the eggs were beautiful... I was very impressed for my first visit.  You can't go wrong with the prices.  Really, there's no need to go to anywhere else if you don't have the desire to feel trendy.  Support the mom and pop business, folks.  They have a good thing going on."}
{"text":"Great good friendly environment cozy and feels like family, always a great way to start the day"}
{"text":"In my work, I tend to find myself all over the city in the mornings doing quotes and service calls for security assessments.  As such, as people who've read over my breakfast list, can see I've tried a ton of places.

One such place was John's Breakfast.  In all honesty, I wasn't expecting anything fancy at all, just some eggs and bacon.  Heck, when you walk inside, you see a place that hasn't seen the hand of a decorator since the early 80s, and a pretty run down decor.  The furniture was dated, and there really isn't much to the inside.  In other words, I had expected it to be a simple greasy spoon, inexpensive and simple.  Instead, I was pleasantly surprised to find a decent all day breakfast joint run by another hard working group who are modest and unassuming.  

They offer a pretty decent omelette, in fact quite a few of them.  There's the other usual breakfast items, like bennies and so on, but their hash brown was actually quite surprisingly good.  Overall, I had a pretty decent breakfast that first time, and have since stopped by maybe every other month when work brings me in that vicinity.

What I did find a little unusual was that the menu also had a few vietnamese offerings, especially when I noticed the odd bottle of vietnamese chili sauce here and there.  I haven't tried it yet, but since the breakfast offerings was such a surprise, I should try these as well."}
{"text":"John's is a quaint breakfast and lunch joint tucked away in a conspicuous little place.  

They offer delicious breakfast all day long, which comes pretty quick and definitely fills the breakfast void.  There isn't anything I love more than breakfast for dinner, and John's doesn't disappoint.

The staff here are all such nice people, it almost feels like you've known them for years.  This place reminds me of what I believe a small-town restaurant feels like.  Everyone knows each other and gathers on a daily basis to gossip about the local news.  That's the major thing I love about John's.

Okay, people aside, the prices and food are absolutely fantastic!  They have wicked hash browns and one of the best breakfast sandwiches in the city.  I'm always too stupid to branch out from what I'm used to and actually try something different.  My theory: why fix what isn't broken?!

I love John's about as much as any other decent breakfast joint in the city.  It's got great food, magnificent people, and is a hidden gem just waiting to be discovered."}
{"text":"Not the usual hipster breakfast place in not the usual hipster breakfast neighborhood. 

It was really busy, and we were there fairly early on a week day morning.  It was so busy that all the outdoor tables were full too, and it was a little chilly outside still.  We beat the second rush, but food was really slow to come, but service was great, and the staff kept us filled up on coffee.  Food and coffee was good and fresh, but nothing spectacular.  Just your basic breakfast fair. 

Place needs to spruce up a little if they want to keep up with the places on Edmonton Tr.  Otherwise a not so secret place for breakfast.

Did I mention the service? In spite of the wait the staff took good care of us, and apologized for the wait a few times."}
{"text":"perfect. the BEST service, really good food (I had fries only because I'd just eaten a huge Stampede Breakfast) and Ron got chorizo omelette for $9 - he said it was 'pretty tasty' and great coffee that just kept getting refilled! 
new fave. 
(plus there's a patio for sunny summer days!)"}
{"text":"Found this place at random, I came here with a buddy of mine for brunch. I got the benedict egg an he ordered the steak and eggs. My plate was great and I had plenty to eat, I did not leave hungry. My friends steak was good but slightly on the tuff side. The Sevice was good and the owners wife was severing us, she was a very nice lady. The place is abit rundown but don't let that fool you, just sit down and enjoy."}
