{"text":"This place is great. I have only been for happy hour, but it is hands down the 2nd best Happy Hour in Cleveland (second only to Lolita which is #1 because of the twice a night happy hour and its proximity to other good bars). Their drinks are not only extremely inexpensive at happy hour (1 for 4$ 2 for 7$ and 3 for 10$) they are delicious. These creative concoctions combine great (in quality and quantity) liquor with mixers that make the 3 for 10$s go down easy. I had a drunken gummi bear martini (mmmmm) and a \"exploding monkey balls\" which was a combo of vodka spite and pop rocks...so good and fun! I also had to try their food. the menu is mostly smaller menu items but I found the tacos to be a perfect meal. I had the portobello and poblano pepper tacos (so yummy ), three for only 4.50 (Most food menu items are 50% during happy hour). I will certainly be hitting up this place again.   I would say the only downside was that there was not outdoor seating...but if you don't mind sitting inside after work then this place is perfect. love it, great addition to Lakewood."}
{"text":"Went with a few buddies after work,  enjoyed their microbrew selection, good happy hour specials. Decided to try some food after seeing an order of ribs come out of the kitchen. Tried the Prog burger, very juicy , tasty, and unique. The saucewas awesome. My buddy got ribs and loved them. Also nibbled on hush puppies, went well with pineapple and mango salsa. Service was fast and friendly, good vibes here, can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff. The grilled shrimp tacos were good. Fun interior. Definately going again."}
{"text":"$4 Martinis during Happy Hour, 3 different kinds of Tacos (including awesome Tilapia Tacos!), and great burgers - what's not to love? Prices are very reasonable as well.  EDITED TO ADD: Just saw they're doing $2 Tacos on Tuesdays!"}
