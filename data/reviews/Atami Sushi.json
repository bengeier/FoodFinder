{"text":"Awesome food! Local sushi spot that is very cozy .. Every time I walk in I get greeted, the food is always fresh! Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"My hubby and I are picky about our sushi. Many claim to be sushi spots, but they lack the culture that we look for in a sushi restaurant. Some chains have tried to make sushi hip, cool, and corporate,by pushing out the culture that invented it in the first place. Atami is authentic, JAPANESE, sushi, and it is oh so tasty, and reasonably priced. The spot is owned by a friendly Japanese couple. The husband handles the sushi right behind the sushi bar.   LOCATION This spot is a hole in the wall location right next to a SUBWAY and some independent businesses. Boo on you if you let the location deter you, and you chicken out and you opt for SUBWAY! Where is your sense of adventure? You are missing out. Some of the best food comes from these types of locations.  RESTAURANT Before you walk in, you'll see their \"A\" Grade proudly posted in their window for everyone to see. An \"A\" Grade is more than enough reason to set my foot in the door!!! It is very neat and clean. The restaurant is tiny. It is sit down, or take out. It has a sushi bar where you can see how your food is prepped. It also has booths and tables.  FOOD  You can order sushi and other Asian dishes from the menu, and they are reasonably price. This is not an easy find. Sushi is often overpriced. One of the highlights of this location is the Bento Special. The Bento Special includes your choice of an entree that comes with soup, rice, 4 California Roll pieces, and a Spring Roll for 6.99. You can tack on their 2 sushi roll combo for an additional $7. The food is fresh and is served on something that is not your traditional white plate. At this location presentation matters.  The menu is nice, but the highlight of this location is the sushi. The sushi is the first thing that you should try. I heart Atami and you should too!!!! Support this local business YELPERS. This place needs to be around because it is legit, and it is oh so tasty."}
{"text":"My fiance found this lovely spot when it had first opened. He is much more adventurous than I, but he convinced me to try it. It is a little warm in there,  and not ideal for small children as they do not have high chairs. Other than that, the food is amazing. I have never really ordered anything besides sushi though. The sushi is so fresh and delicious and reasonably priced also. It is very clean inside and the owners are so sweet and friendly! I love to go in to chat and get my grub on. My personal favorites are the Boston roll, Las Vegas roll and the maguro. Lo mein is pretty good too, and my fiance always orders the bulgoki. Ideal for take out or for people without infants or toddlers."}
{"text":"New to the area & just happened to stop by..great food, reasonable prices. Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Very happy. wonderful husband and wife team. I have enjoyed the sushi on mammy occasions. Fresh ingredients make it 5 star. More of a take out place but they do have seating."}
{"text":"A Ta Mi Sushi was amazing! My boyfriend and I were searching for a very close sushi place that also offered other cuisine options, since he is not a sushi fan.  This place has it all and it is VERY affordable! I had a Miso Soup, Spicy Tuna, and the \"Mexican Roll\" (superb) and he had the Orange Chicken Wok meal and we paid $30 and were stuffed!   I am happy that I found a sushi place that I can go to with my boyfriend - who hates sushi!"}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi and hot &sour soup I've ever had. Excellent service! The orange chicken was perfect."}
{"text":"We have driven by for years and glad to have finally stopped by to check it out. Pleasantly surprised to find a neat clean dining area. We chose a sushi sashimi combo and chinese chicken with garlic. Meal came with miso and really the best egg drop soup. Good size sushi and sashimi freshly made. Everything was good. Its a small operation so service was personalized. We will come again and glad to patronize this new find. Next time I plan to try their katsu or udon noodle soup."}
{"text":"I really like the food here, regular & sushi. The prices are good and it's always delicious. The people that work here are very friendly, stop by and give it a try!"}
{"text":"More like 1.5 stars but I'm rounding up since my lunch companion liked it and mentioned wanting to return.  I think it might be better for takeout since one wouldn't have to deal with the awkward, silent mood set by the older couple who I assume are the owners.  We ordered the $7.00 dine-in bento special.  Note there are absolutely NO substitutions on the bento even for a same-price item (They won't swap the California roll with a cucumber roll.). You'd think they'd be more accommodating when business is so slow, and not be so focused on using their pre-made (and not chilled) California rolls.  The Place was absolutely dead at peak lunch rush time.  No one else came in the entire time.  It was rather sad.  The egg drop soup was very thick/viscous and plain.  It requires me to use the provided soy sauce and pepper.  The pepper shaker was empty and the gentleman (male owner?) had to replace it.  He was stoic, and awkwardly didn't speak or smile.  The music was truly awful.  The silver and black interior is not too bad (they're trying), but it's rather basic.  The chicken katsu was low quality dark meat but moist, with a good crispy crunch of breading on the outside.  It didn't get soggy throughout the meal.  The side of rice was a little small, and slightly dry (I prefer sticky rice).  The deep fried items on the side we're fine, and the sushi was edible but around grocery store level quality.  The woman working (female owner?) wordlessly filled water glasses when needed but did smile until the very end of our meal.  She also barely spoke.  The man and woman sat at a booth on the restaurant floor with a computer while we ate, and the gentleman was making coughing and similar \"sick\" noises, which was off-putting.  He wasn't cooking (the woman vanished into the back so I assume she was the cook - maybe he rolls the sushi or something?), thankfully!  I wouldn't come back on my own volition, but the food was edible enough that I would do take out or tag along if I was in the area and someone else wanted to pay."}
{"text":"Because a -1 star isn't an option I am forced to give a one star rating.  I'm not really sure where to begin because in all honesty, my mind is still attempting to sort out the horribly nightmarish experience I had at this restaurant today.  At my co-worker's advice I agreed to give this place a try (despite the fact that she hadn't been here in more than a year's period of time) she said that from what she could recall the place had pretty decent food...ok, I'm in.  Immediately upon entering the restaurant, I noticed a \"funny\" smell; however, being that I'm not very familiar with the scents that accompany sushi/sushi bar, I convinced myself that I was perhaps being a little too anal and decided to AGAIN take my co-worker at her word that the place had pretty decent food.  After being seated by a gentleman (whom I believe is the owner of the place) I took a looksy at the menu and decided I'd try the crab rangoon (I LOOOOOVE crab rangoon) for an appetizer.  I also ordered the chicken fried rice, my co-worker ordered the vegetable fried rice.  This is where it all began...the crab rangoons, or should I say CRABLESS rangoons were brought to the table.  I tear off one of the ends (as I always do) only to notice that there was NO crab meat inside.  I asked the gentleman if they normally put crab meat in the rangoons and boy did I set off an instant firecracker...\"Yes, there's crab meat in there...a little!\", he says.  \"I've been in business for over 40 years and I never have anyone complain about my rangoons!\", he continues.  At this point I'm not sure whether to speak or run, but before my brain could tell my mouth and body to respond here comes the awkwardly stoic and stoned face woman from behind a curtain-\"What do you expect for $4.50?!  I can't afford to give a lot of crab meat for $4.50!\"  Ok, now I'm thinking, \"Is this real?\"  I begin to speak to them both and explain that if they were offended how truly sorry I was, but because I've never eaten in their establishment, I wasn't sure if they prepared their rangoons the same way in which I'd had them at other places.  Why did I say that?  \"In all the 50 States of America, rangoons are made the same!\"  \"I've never had anyone question my food in 40 years!\", continues the man.  The man proceeds to inform my co-worker that they didn't have all of the vegetables for her fried rice, reluctantly she says \"OK\" only to be brought a plate of overcooked rice and vegetables that were so dry that they looked as though they were going to crack!  At this point we've heard and seen about enough that we're pretty convinced we should leave and hopefully still have time to get  a halfway decent meal from somewhere else.  Yet, we sit long enough for my plate to be brought out only to see yet another plate of overcooked rice and what looked like undercooked chicken with a few vegetables mixed within.  Instantly we explain to the couple that we would NOT be staying for the meal and attempted to leave...the woman pushes me, YES PUSHES ME yelling that we can't leave until we pay for the food.  The man goes on to say, \"I took off the rangoons, but you must pay for this!\"  As my co-worker and I explain that paying for an uneaten meal was not in our plans the woman begins to yell, \"I cook this food for you and now you don't want to pay?  I'll put it in a box and you take it with you!\"  Uh no, we're not paying for your mess-of-a-meal lady, sorry.  At this point the only other five patrons (including two that were children) in the restaurant were totally fixated on the show that was going on.  I COULDN'T BELIEVE THIS WAS HAPPENING!  I explain to the woman that putting her hands on me was EXTREMELY unacceptable and that this type of behavior in front of children was ABSOLUTELY ridiculous.  \"I don't want to hear anything else from you...you just pay me the money!\"  OMG lady, REALLY?!?!?  Believe it or not, I had to call the police, YES THE POLICE, people!  These people were like shark on the prowl!  As I'm dialing the police and still attempting to walk out of the restaurant the man then comes to grab my arm in yet another attempt to keep me from leaving...PURE INSANITY!  After getting out of the door finally the police dispatch informed me that they could not force me to stay in their establishment and strongly suggested that I leave (the people were still screaming and hollering even as I had the dispatcher on the line)!  Not having much of an appetite at this point, I agree to go to Subway, which is a couple of doors down from \"the sushi shop of horror\" with my co-worker only to come out of Subway to the woman storming out of the restaurant still demanding that we come back in her restaurant to pay for her!  When I explained to her that the police gave me instruction NOT to remain in the restaurant and to leave, she gave me what I think was the Japanese version of \"the bird.\"    U-N-B-E-L-I-E-V-A-B-L-E!  Who's ever heard of such a thing?!?!  I'm still in total awe over this!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place , a great go to on my way home from work, great 7 and 8 dollar combo meals.The 3 I have eaten were all good. Always  had great service."}
{"text":"Price is a little bit costly, place is small, but Chet's skill is worth a try."}
{"text":"The food is excellent, as us the service. A true Mom & Pop restaurant. I was impressed with the size and selection of the menu. Tried 2 of the rolls and had a bowl of chicken udon noodles. The rolls were shared as was a large bowl of hot & sour soup. All was excellent. The chicken in my udon melted in my mouth. By far this is my favorite sushi/Japanese/Chinese restaurant....EVER!"}
{"text":"Went here after a long day and all we wanted was sushi and beer.   1) Bar: No liquour license, no beer, no sake, no nada 2) Service: It was just a guy and his wife, and the service was very poor. It took a while to get the sushi menu, after she picked up the sushi order, they neither asked if we'd like anything else, nor took the menus away. Our water was only refilled when we went to the kitchen to ask for more water. She never came to check on the table or if we were happy. Food preparation took nearly an hour and the seemed very poorly organized. The husband kept running back and forth gathering things as opposed to making sushi. Our whole order was not made, but at least we weren't charged for it.  3) Appearance: The bathroom was flooded and water was flooding into the cleanup area of the kitchen. It appeared (thank god) to be coming from the water heater but the smell was still horrible.  4) Fish (cuz that's what we came for right?): It was okay, not fantastic, not horrible."}
{"text":"We were in town on vacation and needed a late dinner.  We eat sushi everywhere so we know good from bad.  This was good sushi.  It wasn't \"great\" or super fancy.  Everything was very tasty and seemed fresh.  The only downer was the rice.  We went late so maybe it had been sitting.   Overall, nice people and good food at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"REALLY small place.  Rolls here are over priced for being an over glorified california roll with something placed ontop of it; which justifies giving it a new name i guess.  I definitely like the terriyaki chicken here more than any other place i have been in awhile. I will come back and hit them up for that in particular. Hunan beef gives A LOT of meat in the servings definitely not stingy with that, which is good for you carnivores out there. It is spicy, not overbearingly spicy though. If you can eat a jalapeno you are good to go. The Katsu, i wanted to try the don katsu but they ran out of the pork, was okay. the breading was good, but the sauce was overwhelming and made it soggy too quickly  My experience here was actually good, it was dead when i went in so i got almost the VIP treatment so i am sure that helped. The owner and i got to talking and found out we are both from seattle so that helped out my experience."}
{"text":"this food is very good.  the crab ragoons are huge and delicious.  the people are very friendly and made to order.  fresh and delicious.  i can not wait to try other things on their menu.  check it out.  very small if eating there. but it's nice"}
{"text":"first time i went the food was good, cali roll to go, service was a little cold.  Second time I was exhausted after a crap day at work, wanted to pick up some soup and a cali roll, go home and chill.  I called ahead to make sure they were open, man said \"we open tip 9\".  when i got there at 8:45 he said sorry we are closed, i said i just called you and he proceeded to argue with me.  He was about to make my cali roll when his wife i think started yelling in a non-english language.  I asked to maybe get something real easy and she kept yelling at him.  finally I gave up and let them know that i intended to not ever come back and not refer a single person to their establishment due to the unacceptable customer service, the man said \"go, get out to here\", sheer rudeness like i have never encountered.  Tired and begrudgingly i went further down the road to Sushi Style, received timely, friendly, perfect service and excellent food.  So sad about Atami because food is good but I would rather not have my head bitten off to get it!"}
{"text":"This small sushi bar is the closest to real Japanese food I have found! It is amazing and deserves to be praised. They have made a long time customer out of me....."}
{"text":"3rd visit.  I bring new people with me every time.  Bento boxes were loved.  Sushi combos were loved.  Roll combos were loved.  Crab Ragoons were loved.  Chicken Curry loved.  Service may be a little slow if crowded because Grandma and Grandpa Sushi run the place alone but it's worth the wait.  5 of us ordered whatever we wanted and have leftovers - bill less than $60 with tip.  Would have been $100 for 3 of us at our regular sushi joint."}
{"text":"Yummy sushi. Yummy menu. Sweet price. I am a regular and have been to this little hole-in-the-wall sushi place ever since they opened. LOVE the Volcano and Spider roll. There goyza are tasty, too. Mom is the cook in the back preparing all the hot food items and Dad is the amazing sushi chef at the dainty sushui bar. I really love this place,    'nuff said."}
{"text":"My husband and I love Sushi this is right around the corner. Aami has a wide selection of rolls that are delicous. I call ahead and my take out is always ready when I get there"}
{"text":"I had lunch at this sushi restaurant yesterday after reading the yelp reviews, apparently it's a great sushi place. I'm originally from CA, so I have very high expectations when it comes to fresh fish at a sushi bar. The restaurant is operated by the husband and wife, very nice couple. I walked in and the place was empty, I sat at the sushi bar, I was the only one the whole time I was there. I ordered one of their specialty rolls and salmon sashimi. The roll was good, but warm, I don't like warm rolls. The sashimi was cut too thick for my liking and I had the taste in my mouth the rest of the day, so it obviously wasn't fresh, not surprised being that we're in AZ. I'm done trying out sushi restaurants in AZ, I'll just have to wait until I go visit my family in CA to eat some good fresh sushi."}
{"text":"Good sushi and good prices. Small family enviornment and the taste is worth the wait. Sushi is made fresh and tastes great!"}
{"text":"I tried the food because of the reviews on yelp. The sushi was good and made fast.  My only issues was that we came about 30 minutes before they had an afternoon closure.  As they flipped the closed sign we felt very rushed and the sushi chef even told me they are closing and made us feel hurried.   When I spend 50 bucks on lunch for two, I hate being rushed and stared at.   Good food, bad manners!"}
{"text":"permanently closed! so sad but true! So torn. They had a delicious and simple menu. Their chicken Katsu, soups and specialty sushi rolls were yummy. It will be missed :("}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the sushi we had.....the hot and sour soup was delicious.I like supporting a local family who obviously works very hard to make great food"}
{"text":"This tiny little place has a chef who has been making real sushi for many, many years and it shows well it tastes. This place is probably not for those who like to eat those big fat sushi rolls stuffed with cream cheese and everything else imaginable. Though they do serve those rolls that are deep fried and what not, still their best ones are the simplest. Every time I've been there, the service has been great. Su ( I don't really know how to spell her name) makes a great hot and sour soup. The fish is always fresh, just grab a slice and place it on your tongue it tastes so great it melts. And it doesn't hurt that every once in a while when we're sitting there chit chatting with the owners we get a free roll or soup."}
