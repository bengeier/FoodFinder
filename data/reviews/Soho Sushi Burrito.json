{"text":"I'm so..... Heated... I bought the 3 amigo and it was amazing.... I can't believe they'd serve me something this good"}
{"text":"Great food, excellent service.  The portions are generous.  There is always a long line but it goes surprisingly fast.  I've tried several other of these sushi burrito/poke places as they open... this is the best and the only one I return to again and again."}
{"text":"Lets just say, I live a good 25 minutes away, but try to visit this place at least once a week. ITS INCREDIBLE. I think I must have introduced about 11 or so people here who have also fallen in love with Soho as well. The quality of all your options are immaculanet, so whatever you order off the menu will be terrific. I would HIGHLY recommend anyone who is considering coming here, to go. You won't regret it. The only thing is that the space itself is kind of small, but I've always managed to find seats when I'm there."}
{"text":"I thought this place would be a hidden jem, but the place is always jamming! You'll be lucky if there's no line. That only means the place is amazing! Small but clean. Staff is friendly and work their asses off! So far everything I've tried on the menu is awesome! You can even create your own meal. Definitely give it a try."}
{"text":"Ok this place is cool! Love the concept of Japanese and Mexican fusion ..who doesn't like a huge sushi roll?! It does remind me of spam musubi but better..
Of course then there's the whole burrito thing ..instead of a tortilla u can have it with a seaweed wrap or rice paper wrap ..so kinda healthier maybe? At least u will feel like u doing healthy Ha! 

I had the Triple S ...wow! Soft shell crab, spicy Tuna, Jalapeño Masago, tempura crunch and bunch of other stuff ..so u have a choice of seaweed wrap or rice thing wrap or even tortilla I guess ..but this is best with seaweed according to the master ;)

And if u like Taro or know what it is ? Get the Taro chips ! Kinda like tortilla chips concept served in a brown Baggie and cheese (I no like the cheese part"}
{"text":"I used their online ordering because I was on my lunch break, very easy to use. The building was clean, friendly fast service, and the place was pretty busy for the lunch hour. I got the spicy tuna bowl with brown rice and it was delicious! Fresh tuna and veggies, and the portions are very generous for the low price. I got my sushi fix!"}
{"text":"Come here for my birthday whit my boyfriend.
The staff was absolutely amazing!

The service excellent 
I highly recommend it ."}
{"text":"I love this place. Soho Japanese Restaurant on Jones has always been at the top of my list for great sushi.  This place is owned by the same guy and the food is simply top-notch. I think this was the first sushi burrito place in town and now I've noticed a few others popping up. Food is fresh, service is friendly and fast, location is convenient to my work. I've eaten here at least 6 times in the last 3 months and loved each meal.  I highly recommend the Redondo and make sure you try the Taro chips."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!!  The food is utterly delicious and and crave worthy!!  The Twin Dragon is the best thing on the menu and they allow you to substitute items and have it made to your exact specifications.  Worth the trip!"}
{"text":"It was my first visit to this establishment and I had to go back to get an item that was forgotten. Luckily, I was not far otherwise I would of been very upset to have to drive almost an hour back to get my complete order.  I'm very disappointed as I had high hopes for my meal."}
{"text":"Stop by yesterday before heading back to LA. All I can say is it's fire. The fire cracker was amazing, finally a spicy tuna that's actually spicy. Also to the gentleman who helped us out, he's one of the main reasons besides how amazing the food was, will be returning whenever we're in town. My sister is 9 she's a pretty picky eater but she sure loved this place. She also loves masago so when she saw how much he put in her roll it was heaven for her. Can't wait for out next trip, we'll definitely be coming back for more."}
{"text":"I love this place. Great food at a great price. The ingredients are fresh and the staff is always nice. I've been here probably 50 times and I will be by at least 50 more."}
{"text":"Came in because i seen an advetisement on amazon. I was in the mood for sushi but something different. As soon as my wife and i walked in we were greeted with smiling faces welcoming us.  The setup reminds of subway,which is cool because you can see them ass they make it. It wasnt a long wait but oh yeah there were plenty of people deciding what to get and watching in awe how they expertly roll these beautiful sushi burritos. The place was very clean..small square tables make up the dinning area. When you get to the window,you can create your own or just choose any of the items off the menu. They have sushi bowls or burrito. I decided to try. 2 twin dragons full and 3 amigos..with seawood and reg white sushi rice(other options are available). My order was quite expensive but not unreasonable considering its sushi(fish, seafood). My order came up to $35.00. When you are paying for you meal,they print up options to as to what to tip according to your order,not mandatory but you kind of feel like you have too. Not that the employees dont deserve it. I was excited so i decided to eat a half in store. They have a salad bar which consist of. All sushi fixings;ginger,wasabi,soy sauce etc. The full size burritos are not huge but its enough for an adult. They pre cut in half for you. Took my first bite i was in heaven. It taste just like sushi in burrito with all the flavors complimenting eachother. Some of my filling did come out but thats to be expected but the seaweed wrap held up. I do find that if you go homw and put in the freezer for a bit ,it holds better when eaten. Great experience,great food,happy atmosphere but a bit pricey. You would want to eat here everyday but the price will stop you lmaooo"}
{"text":"Had it for lunch today on Sahara location...will be having it for dinner tonight by the house on S 215 and Jones great food and price"}
{"text":"I have been coming here since it opened, not once has the food been anything less than great! The staff is great as well, very nice and attentive. Since UberEats delivers for Soho, I have been ordering it more frequent. A buritto is just enough food that you feel satisfied"}
{"text":"Delicious concept! I had the vegetable tofu burrito and added shrimp tempura and crunch.. Yum!!! Hubby had the twin dragons and also loved it! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. We got greeted as soon as we walked through the door. It was our first time here and they were very nice about explaining their different burritos and options. My husband got the Caterpillar burrito and I got the Twin Dragon. I must say they were both delicious!!! I strongly recommend trying either if it's your first time here. We will definitely be coming back again."}
{"text":"LOVVVVVVVVVVVVVE this place. If I could eat it every day I SO would. Pictures do not do justice. I am definitely addicted lol There is never a time this place is NOT busy. The food is always fresh and the burritos are NEVER sloppy! My boyfriend sometimes even orders DOUBLE and they still manage to make it work!! Cheers to your continued success :)"}
{"text":"Sushi is amazing, workers are rude. I've been to this location for the third time today and the same workers look miserable. It completely ruins the experience of the customer. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Had the Twin Dragon and it was awesome, can't wait to try the other burritos!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and really yummy food!! Will definitely be back to try different burritos. Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Had a burrito. It was very good. The staff was young, but professional and friendly. They were really patient despite my notoriously slow ordering and even though I came in just a few minutes before close. Good prices, good food, good staff. For what it is, it is really solid. Nice job."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with this place, I go often and am never disappointed. The food is always fresh, the staff is friendly and the price is right. Not all sushi burrito places are created equal, this one stands apart from the rest. 
Pro tip: you get more bang for your buck by going with the bowl instead of the burrito."}
{"text":"The food is alright. Sauce can overwhelm everything else. Service is quick though."}
{"text":"If you are a sushi lover, you will LOVE Soho Sushi Burritos!! It was so so soooooo GOOD!!! I had the Twin Dragon burrito and it was phenomenal! I will definitely be coming back here to try more things off the menu!! Great concept! Love it!"}
{"text":"this place is located nearby my house, so it's very convenient for me when i'm on-the-go or when i'm on my way home. The workers are very, very sweet and friendly. So that's an A++ for great customer service! Every single time i walk in here, they greet with a very warm welcoming! As in, ALL of the workers all greet me! i find that the prices are pretty reasonable, especially the big amount of food they give. They're not stingy with their toppings at all, which i like, because some places give like a teaspoon of fish lol! The workers engage in small conversations with me and not just talking about ordering food wise. Which is cool, because they treat you like a friend not just a customer. aww! haha"}
{"text":"Too much mushy rice in comparison to the other ingredients. Also, I got it through postmates & they couldn't even get my order correct. It tasted bland as well."}
{"text":"The space is extremely cramped and very tight seating, the staff is fast as long as you know how to order, and friendly. The food is outstanding ....no complaints!"}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to expect when I came here to eat, but the wait was well worth it. Upon coming to this place, I immediately saw that it was clean and the workers here are extremely friendly. I ordered the rockaport and was extremely impressed of the quality, presentation, and speed that the food was made it. Best of all it tasted just as amazing as it looked. This is a place you want to come to and eat! I cannot wait until I come back here."}
{"text":"Sooooooo good! I went with a friend for lunch. It was my first time at this type of place so the staff helped me configure my burrito. I ordered the seaweed with sushi rice and spicy tuna and salmon, plus a couple of toppings and sauces. It tasted so FRESH! Also had the miso soup which was hot and yummy. I could only eat half the burrito, so I saved the other half for breakfast the next morning and it was STILL really fresh.

Now I crave this place!"}
{"text":"So been wanting to try a sushi burrito! It was so good. Wish they had a place in az. I will be back. Service was great. They took the time to explain the menu before you ordered."}
{"text":"This was my second time going and I love how fast and fresh it is!! Would recommend to anyone who loves easy to hold sushi!"}
{"text":"-A Burrito Joint without Burritos-  UNLV Location

When I first heard of the concept of Japanese sushi rolls combined with Mexican food, I was thrilled. However upon closer inspection and digestion, I found that the Mexican part of the equation was lacking, severely. This is a burrito joint without flour tortillas! That would be like a burger place without any buns! Meats like Al Pastor, Adobada, and Carnitas were not offered. Mariscos were not included either. They didn't even give you the option of adding Tapatio or Valentina to your burrito, much less things like salsa verde, and roja. This is at best a Chipotle + Sushi combination. 

The food is good, it's made well and the service is prompt, but I think the fusion especially the burrito part is a giant misnomer."}
{"text":"I'm so in love with this place. Today was my first time ever going, but the concept is what drew me to it. The staff is very friendly and the food was amazing. A little bit of the ends fell out, but like any burrito stuffed with amazing ingredients that will happen.  I'm complete happy with this place it's price I just wish there were more locations."}
{"text":"This place delivers amazing food every time I go in. I am up addicted to the triple S which I will continue to get until the end of time !!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I'm from Cali and an adventurous eater. To the best of my knowledge, this is an original concept. Food is great. Staff are friendly. Sushi are fresh. It's a great place overall. I just hope the quality doesn't change over time."}
{"text":"Came here with 2 friends for dinner and we all can't wait to come back for more deliciousness!  
Great value for the amount of food you get.  
My 1 friend wanted to try the homemade taro chips with cheddar cheese sauce and boy am I glad she did! It was SO good!  Sounds weird but it was a good combination.  There is some kind of seasoning on the chips.
I got the \"High Maintenance\" but substituted the yellowtail for tuna.  Very generous portions with the toppings and quick service!
The whole time we were there there was a constant stream of people on a Tuesday night!"}
{"text":"I had the twin dragon. It was very good. I work nearby so I will definitely be back. 

The line was long when I got there, but they work through it diligently. It took them about 20 minutes to get through the 30 people in front of me. Be prepared to wait. It's worth it though!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan! I love the truck that comes from la for foodie fest every year, so when heard from friends and saw all the write ups for THIS place... Had to check it out! I made my own sushi burrito. The creamy cilantro sauce was spot on mixed with the mango soy and the portions of fish were worth the price. I combined salmon and yellowtail and it was crazy delicious. I opted for soy paper instead of seaweed paper and was a great choice. So was my brown rice (and they don't charge extra for brown rice---yay for that!!!!) my only recommendation is to ask them to roll it really well/tight. My burrito fell apart in less than 3 bites!!! FYI; Be prepared to wait in line for 15+ minutes!"}
{"text":"I thought I wouldn't like this place, but it was AMAZING. I got the 3 Amigos with cream cheese added to it, and it was fantastic. I didn't think a single \"burrito\" would be filling enough, but I was wrong; I got a wonderfully large portion of fish in my \"burrito\", and it was delicious!

The only downside to my visit was that a lady was able to bring her dog AND dine-in without issues, and a sushi place is one of the last places you want to have an animal walking around. I love dogs, but I don't want fur floating into my food."}
{"text":"Portions are huge! Ordered too many items cause I was excited lol. Had a Twin Dragon sushi burrito which is basically a burrito sized sushi roll. You can add traditional sushi ingredients  to the Mexican items and vice versa. I also had a carne asada burrito and that was good too. Good friendly service. Lots of potential combinations so take your time and pick out things you like!"}
{"text":"I like it !

Very easy ! 
Very casual !
But I still can eat raw fish ! 
( I don't know how fresh fish is , but so far nothing problem with it ! ) 

I make my own sushi roll . 
I like salmon , and not too much topping . 
Every time I pay like $8 to $10 .. 

It's not really cheap .....
But still I like it !"}
{"text":"If you like Mexican food and sushi.  This is the place to try.  From spicy tuna to veggies.  Can't go wrong.  Highly recommend to those that craves both."}
{"text":"Pretty good! Came in at 9:20pm food still fresh and good..i got the burrito and it was very satisfying and a light meal, i dont usually eat late at night but i was hungry and this did the trick!"}
{"text":"You must check this place out!!!!  So so SO good.  We got the twin dragon, salmon sunrise and triple s along with the taro chips.  The taro chips had a furikake type seasoning and was addicting.  If you like sushi, you must visit."}
{"text":"Went to lunch with a friend. The place was packed. The line was out the door and it took us about 30 minutes to place an order. But the wait was worth it. If you are headed there for lunch during workdays, keep that in mind. But the place is excellent and food is clean."}
{"text":"I had the 3 Amigos for the first time and I must say it was more than what I expected. A combination of both my favorites, sushi and burrito. Definitely the place to go to when you're craving both! I'll be coming back for more"}
{"text":"Wish there was one of these in every city... So innovative and fresh.. Literally meets the food needs of all people"}
{"text":"Sushi should only be consumed at a sushi restaurant. My co workers and I (about 7 of us) ordered from soho last week tuesday before thanksgiving. We all got sick the next 2 days vomiting or having diarrhea. No one else at work was sick. I've tried different sushi burrito places and it's a good concept but nothing extraordinary. Never eating sushi burritos again. Employees should be monitored for illnesses and sushi at these establishments should be kept properly to avoid any sicknesses like we had."}
{"text":"The food is great but it's been a few times where I'll order 2 to 3 sushi bowls to go and bring it back home just to see that 1 or 2 bowls doesn't have any sauce or missing some toppings.You would think they would actually check their work thoroughly before giving it to their paying customer. I understand that sometimes there's a line but rushing through orders shouldn't be the priority to where something that you paid for isn't there. They expected me to drive all the way back to their location just to enjoy the food I ordered to go. It would've been different if the order is for dine in but  they don't know how the hassle, the inconvenience they put their customer through. Not only I've wasted gas to drive back and forth when I should've been already enjoying my dinner. They couldn't offer to deliver but they want me to drive back then have my dinner."}
{"text":"I love poke bowls and poke burritos. I have tried different poke burritos from Arizona, California and New York. I have to say I was a bit disappointed at the poke burrito I got from SOHO, who has 4.5 star rating on Yelp. My raw salmon was drenched in ponzu sauce which made the burrito sour and I could not taste the salmon at all. I also think there are too much selection of sauces and ingredients which makes it very easy to put the wrong things together and make a poke burrito taste odd."}
{"text":"What a fun little place. Very young attractive and hip crowd. I had the \"Twin Dragon\" not too bad, didn't knock my socks off but not bad. They will have to expand soon. Real small place and packed."}
{"text":"Great concept and super friendly service. This was my first time here and the girl working were was so helpful and patient explaining everything to me. You have the option of ordering one of the many choices off the menu or you can create your own sushi burrito \"Chipotle style\" by going down the line and telling the employee what/how you want your burrito fixed. I picked the \"3 amigos\" off of the menu and it was delicious. It was also very filling which is my biggest gripe with sushi, I'm always hungry and hour or two after I eat it but this time I was still full almost 4 hours later."}
{"text":"On a trip to Las Vegas with my family, we stopped here for lunch. I was very excited since I really love sushi! It definitely lived up to my expectations. They have vegetarian options, a build your own burrito option, and even sushi bowls! I personally chose to have a sushi burrito with soy paper, sushi rice, shrimp tempura, and eel sauce. It's amazing! Sushi burritos are a blessing to this universe in my opinion."}
{"text":"I love love the idea of putting sushi into a burrito! It's like something I would eat when I'm cravinv sushi but not wanting to spend a lot of money. It's my go to place. All the sushi burritos that I've gotten so far were okay. Theyre not the best but theyre not the worst either. And sometimes my burritos taste different every single time i go even though I always get the same one. Maybe it's the sauce. I am not a picky eater so it's okay. I recommend this place :)"}
{"text":"This concept is brilliant and delicious! My second day in a row coming here.. Ordered the same two burritos: Triple S and 3 Amigos, both $10.50

Gave me my sushi fix without the sushi fix cost."}
{"text":"Very fresh and flavorful! The burrito was the perfect size for lunch. Fast and friendly service too."}
{"text":"Blew my mind. I was slightly skeptical at first, but now I\"m a sushi burrito believer. Got the double dragon burrito with soy paper. $13 all in all for quality lunch is a steal, bring a friend...I so could have split the roll and been solid."}
{"text":"Great food and great prices. Chicken teriyaki over brown rice with sauce is the best. I add the vegetables and it's a healthy filling meal"}
{"text":"Little shop of chipotle style sushi very close to the strip. The line was very long when I came in but it moves quickly since it was nicely staff. I love their build your own option. Their honey habenero sauce was so good. I would come back when I visit Vegas!"}
{"text":"Restaurant is very clean seeing as it is new. While I have gone to their other location this one is the one I enjoy the most as it is much closer. The staff was very friendly and made it an overall pleasant experience the food was basically the same as their other location so nothing exactly new there except that there was more focus on the bowls. Other than that I would come back again from time to time."}
{"text":"Menu has been changed. It used to be very busy,  but not that busy anymore. It has less option than most of burrito place now."}
{"text":"So good!! I came here today after the gym and I got the north shore bowl ... Half sushi rice half salad and added ponzu sauce and jalapeños and cucumber... It's was so good and just what I needed! I will definitely be back soon!!"}
{"text":"All the food here is so dank!!! 3 amigos is definitely my go too. Also tried the taro chips for fun and they were surprisingly delicious"}
{"text":"When I need a quick fix, don't have time or room for all you can eat I come here!!!! I always get the 3 amigos burrito which seems to give the most sashimi and taste amazing! Taro chips and cheese were surprisingly delicious as well!! Aloe vera drinks ++++ lots of good sauces and lime for free~"}
{"text":"This was a very tasty and delightful experience. Never been to this place. My cousin brought me here since I was visiting from California. I love sushi and the Salmon choice I ordered hit my palette and taste buds just right. Yum couldn't have gotten anything tastier. Very fresh they make it right in front of you. You are able to order half sizes if you prefer. The portion is enough to share in my opinion and leave you satisfied. I ordered a whole one but ate half and was satisfied. I really enjoyed this place."}
{"text":"I normally go to the location on Badura and Jones. I am very happy with the Badura and Jones location. 

I called the Sahara location to verify that they would be able to make the Sunset bowl that is available at the other location if I ordered it. The lady on the phone confirmed that they knew what the Sunset bowl was and it was available. My coworker went to order food and was told they did not know what it was. After reading the menu description from the other location over the phone to them they delivered a bowl that was a quarter of the way filled with rice and a very small amount of fish. 

I will continue to go to the Badura location, but will avoid the Sahara location from now on."}
{"text":"I found bones in my Hey Reb! meal and got very sick while eating the food. I threw away the food halfway after eating. Waste of $11 if you tell me. I've eaten sushi many times at much better places but who wants to eat bones in their sushi? I emailed corporate but they didn't respond so I'm going to leave a negative review. Garbage food, garbage company, will not be giving them business anymore whatsoever."}
{"text":"Love it!!!! Ordered steak and egg burrito and it is delicious =) very accurate on your order and fast. Staffs are friendly and courteous. They have great selections on what to make for your burrito and the way I see it, anything you put in there will be perfect. Definitely a place to visit when in town."}
{"text":"Blah! Terrible. Not very many options unless you like raw seafood. Not a good place for a sushi beginner."}
{"text":"The wait was long but well worth it.  I drove across town just to come try this place.  The fish is so fresh and the menu really hits all then sushi lovers out there.  From raw to cooked they have it.  Make it any way you want. The taro chips are really good.  I prefer soy paper over nori or tortillas. The poke sauce and creamy cilantro are a great combo. Thank you to the team for busting out that lunch rush today without a sweat!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The concept is genius. It's like chipotle and your favorite sushi bar had a baby. You have to try the housemade taro chips & nacho cheese sauce. Totally addictive. It is very small and crowded, so take it to go."}
{"text":"Had the Twin Dragon it was like eating a hand roll  on steroids. Outstanding item, served fresh ,service was excellent. I should have ordered another item to go,it was that good"}
{"text":"Tried it last night and it was amazing! The salmon was fresh, the avocado was fresh & it was great! The price is good for the portion size."}
{"text":"G-double O-D!!! The Chipotle of sushi burritos!!! Long line but well worth the wait...

Ordered the 3-amigos to keep it simple and it was nice, fresh and savory for off the strip goodness! Definitely not as huge as a Chipotle burrito but large enough, these guys stuff these burritos quite generously.

The staff is super friendly EVEN while it was super chaotic inside. More locations please"}
{"text":"Low grade fish. Tuna and salmon looked exactly the same. Fish was too fishy. The salmon and tuna both had a soggy texture. Spicy mayo had no flavor let alone any spice to it. Rice wasn't cooked right. Ponzu sauce had no flavor. Bad experience."}
{"text":"Just left and I had to bring one burrito home for later.  Really enjoyed my experience.  The staff is very nice-go I promise you won't be disappointed.  I'll be back to try the poke bowls."}
{"text":"Really just amazing quality and price. I love this place soooo much- and a big perk is since going vegan I can still totally eat here. I love you soho sushi burrito!!!  I always get a bowl with sushi rice and all the sauces and toppings I want- the chipotle mayo ( and yes they have a vegan version too!) and unagi sauce are just soooo good. My boyfriend always gets the grilled chicken bowl and loves it and he's a picky eater. Highly recommend, I eat here often."}
{"text":"Great food!  Fast and friendly service.  Well-organized and efficient."}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical at first but i ended up really liking this place. Cool concept and good food. It doesnt look like it would be filling but surprisingly it was. Ill definitely be back to try some of the other concoctions that they have created. I cant remember which one i got but i know it referenced the lion king so i had to get that one."}
{"text":"Holy bejeebees this place was good! I had tried Jaburritos at the Linq promenade and thought that was really good and didn't believe my cousin when he said that place was crap in comparison. I had the 3 Amigos which had tuna, salmon and hamachi which of course are my favorites. There's so many toppings that you can play around with too. I asked for no red onions but to add the spicy Chipotle mayo sauce, mmmmmm so good! I wouldn't say it's spicy but added a slight zing! My friend got a poke bowl with spicy tuna but let me mention that their spicy tuna was definitely spicy, so just a warning. She said it's good mixed with the eel sauce to add sweetness so just a suggestion. But yea, when it comes to sushi burritos, this place is bomb! My cousin goes every time he visit Vegas and I'll have to do it the same! I don't get the luxury of sushirittos at my home town and test I get that it's essentially an uncut sushi roll, but it's good! Try it! Lol FYI it can be a bit messy, but what burrito isn't?"}
{"text":"Yes! Thank you Chef John for treating us to more of your culinary genius. There is a solid range of sauce and fish combinations to satisfy everyone's palate. My go to: Twin Dragon burrito. Portions are satisfying. You will notice that the ingredients are always top notch. Staff is friendly, happy and ready to assist any newbies. A high standard is set and Soho always delivers!"}
{"text":"Best spot in Vegas.  Great sushi for the money, good environment and great service.  The bowls were great.  The burritos were well built, and filling. Don't go anywhere else, this is the place."}
{"text":"It seems that poke shops gained so much popularity in 2016. With that, there are amazing poke shops and horrible ones as well. Soho is definitely on the better side.

ATMOSPHERE: This Soho replaced the Metro Pizza in the UNLV Student Union and replaced Metro Pizza. It constantly has a packed line. There are a lot of people working at this restaurant and it's great because the food always made quickly.

FOOD: You have your choice of preset recipes or creating your own masterpiece. It's your preference if you want a poke burrito or a poke bowl, but I prefer getting a bowl. I will say, in this expensive generation, $10 at Soho can get you a lot more than other restaurants. Their portions are big and they are not stingy with their toppings. If you don't add on a bunch of stuff and stay within what is included, you can get your entree with a miso soup and a drink, all for under $10. They also have their famous Taro Chips and Cheese if you want to try something different or they have individually packaged Ice Cream Mochi if you're craving something sweet.

NOTE: My only critique about this place is that their rice is dry compared to other poke shops."}
{"text":"Just tried Soho Sushi Burrito for the first time and OMG was it good!!!  We ordered food and had it delivered to the office.  I had the Twin Dragon burrito and it was absolutely delicious!  Large, fresh burrito for a great price.  Everyone really enjoyed it and we received the order quickly.  Will definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"I was very pleased with the quality, and quantity of the food that was provided. It's definitely a business I plan to return to."}
{"text":"Had to Come here twice in one trip! Is that good! I wen't with the bowl , 3 amigos-- highly recommend .. just do it!"}
{"text":"Amazing Sushi Burritos!
We got the firecracker and the twin dragon, both were excellent!
We also ordered the taro chips with cheese dip, super tasty!
It is well worth to drive here, for sure I am coming back to try some of the other burritos and the rice bowls"}
{"text":"First time to try this place since it was across our home. I built my own bowl, soft shell crab and ahi tuna, my husband got the caterpillar and my son had a build his own ahi and surimi.  They didn't have that much choices comparing it to the other places i have tried. Very limited... 

Quality of fish was good, half way down to my bowl i found HAIR!!! I waited for a server to speak with, because i didn't want the customer ordering to hear or see it.... that just made the meal so disappointing. I guess really nothing much to say about soho. It was an experience"}
{"text":"This is the BEST place for Sushi Burritos!!! I love this place and tell everyone about it. It's always fresh and tastes delicious. Life long customer here for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing and a genius idea. It's sister, sushi restaurant, Soho Japanese Restaurant, right down the road is my favorite sushi in vegas. 

The fish is fresh and the portions are perfect. I got the Twin Dragon burrito and asked them to swap the crab meat for yellowtail.  Seafood wrap, shrimp tempura, spicy tuna and yellowtail. With a sweet mayo drizzle.  So good that I woke up thinking about it this morning and will be going back again this afternoon for the 2nd day in a row."}
{"text":"The twin dragon is my all time favorite! My first time ever going here was about a year ago and that was the first thing I ever ordered and have been hooked ever since. Every time I go back that is exactly what I get. I love this place! So yummy."}
{"text":"I am first time try SushiBurrito,woww what a great idea.Great food and great service. I ordered 3 amigo it was amazing,very filling, The fish was great quality, the flavors are prefect. I love sushiburritos."}
{"text":"OMG the best place in Las Vegas for sushi burritos.  I really appreciate them being ok with substitutions."}
{"text":"Food is amazing. The staff was friendly and helpful. I will definitely be returning. The burritos are big enough to split, or save half for later."}
{"text":"Amazing place.  I found this place using Yelp while in town for CES.  It looked a bit suspect as the store front was under construction, but when you entered the store, it was nice and clean, packed with people enjoying the food.  I made my way to the counter where they greeted me and told me how to order.  Very similar to all the build your own sandwich/burrito places, but with sushi ingredients!!  I made my own burrito with Nori, Tempura Shrimp, Crab Salad, Seaweed Salad, Cabbage, Cucumbers, Unagi sauce, spicy mayo, and tempura crunches, not to forget the Sushi Rice.  They wrap up the burrito nicely, pretty much like a giant sushi roll.  

It was great! Very tasty, and the sauce recommendation was on point.  Just keep in mind, nori is a lil tough to bite on, so it may get a little messy, but I enjoyed nonetheless.  I may try a soy paper version next time.  

Try this place, you'll love it, and will want to share with your friends as well.  I'll be going back to get a burrito to take home with me."}
{"text":"Very reasonable price clean good atmosphere friendly service and a good quantity of food would highly recommend"}
{"text":"Delicious place to eat. Mexican, Japanese mixed dish of burrito wuth sushi. The only drawback is that it can get crowded and since its a small place, there's no place left to seat."}
{"text":"Food was good the 3rd time i visited there the unagi had some bone in them. Been here a couple of time. Would eat here again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I go to UNLV and SOHO is one of the normal spots I go for food. I have read reviews about other poke spots and they all talk about how bad the food was spoiled and so on. I had never experienced that at soho until today...9/27/2017. To start, the portion they gave was utter nonsense. Normally they give three scoops of the proteins, but today they gave one. The employees were also talking about things that I felt were inappropriate during work. I understand the staff is young and that it is a college campus, but I do not want to hear about someone's party habits while I'm ordering food from them. Now, to top it all off when I received my bowl and opened it the putrid stench of the salmon almost made me gag. I was only able to take one bite and now my stomach is killing me. Never will I eat there again!"}
{"text":"These sushi burritos are so fresh and insanely delicious!! Really creative, and you can build your own or eat it as a bowl or nachos. Yumm... Subway get out of the way, is sushi time!!"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi burritos at a convenient location.  Quick service and good prices.  Be sure to get there before 1200 as it gets busy at lunch."}
{"text":"Very impressed with flavor and speed of building the burritos and getting on our way. We had 3 Amigos which was great and High Maintenance which was also great (lil too much guac but no complaints) will be trying a couple different ones the next visit. Great lunch spot! 

Twin dragon and triple s today....similar in flavor. Both great. Triple s was slightly better. 

High maintenance and triple s next visit. Or I might create my own."}
{"text":"First time here and I got the Twin Dragon! It was sooooo yummy and just as good as a hand roll from our fav sushi joint! I will definitely be coming here again and again! If definitely got busy after 6:30 pm so if you ware wanting to avoid a rush, you might want to show up a little early!"}
{"text":"Really amazing and flavorful. Clean and tasty fusions. I wish they were in my home state 

But the staff is so amazingly nice and inviting. It's just a damn good experience to try new foods."}
{"text":"And just like that ... I found my soulmate omg I can't believe after all this time just today I decided to try this place....
3 amigos is my favorite burrito but I add crab meat and spicy ponzu on soy paper with a Cold green tea just delicious best sushi burrito in Las Vegas.
Great service everybody is so friendly."}
{"text":"Online ordering is fast.  Better than Jawburrito.  Love their Poke Bowls and Sushi Burritos.  I won't go anywhere else."}
{"text":"I'm Japanese know about Sushi well. Sushi Burrito is beyond  imaginations. I ate 3 Amigos Tuna, Sermon, yellowtail and Mexican taste topping.
It is so tasty , it is not traditional sushi, it is new concept and new culture . 
I love to go back again whenever I go to International Education Center in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Really awesome lunch spot. The burritos are delicious and filling, service is super fast and everything is fresh and perfect. Prices are really reasonable for what you're getting.  Perfection!and I expect nothing less from the Soho folks."}
{"text":"The remarkable rise of the infamous sushi burrito is all the craze and has officially joined the ranks of culinary chimeras -- seducing us all with this mexican japanese fusion mixture of sushi meets burrito. Considering we used to have to travel all the way to California to a location or stand an hour in line at the local Foodie Fest to get our fix of this -- Las Vegas locals keep this place busy! 

FOR HER:
- TRIPLE S (soft shell crab, spicy tuna, surimi crab, red onion, jalapeno, cucumber, tempura crunch, sweet chipotle mayo & unagi sauce). No jalapenos for me though! 
FOR HIM: 
- TWIN DRAGON (shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, surimi crab, lettuce, cucumber, guacamole, crispy wonton strips, sweet chipotle mayo, unagi sauce). No cucumbers for him.

Everything was 100% satisfactory. Ingredients are fresh, flavor is on point, and no complaints whatsoever. The taro chips are coated in a sweet layer of furikake that pairs so well with it too! There was a bar with condiments but honestly, none was needed. Not only do they offer sushi burritos, but also salads, rice bowls and nachos -- with protein choices raw & cooked, and a full topping bar of 15 fresh vegetable items. The possibilities are endless!"}

{"text":"If you like portable flavor on the go, look no further!  Grab a handful of dynamite sushiburrito here!  I got the 3 amigos with extra yellowtail.  EXPLOSIVE!"}
{"text":"This is a place that I loved as JaBurrito. Then they wanted to change the name which I was cool with too. But then the menu changed as well and I was heart broken. 

Not that Soho is bad, but they definitely added more of the Hispanic flavor into the newer menu. The burritos are good, but not as wonderful as the original menu. They've mentioned that they will still make anything from their old menu, but somewhere in between, they loss that pizzazz. Still good. Just not as great."}
{"text":"Finally made our way here for lunch today. Boy have we been delaying the best lunch around! My wife got the Twin Dragon burrito, my daughter got the 3 piece shrimp tempura, and I got the High Maintenance nachos. All three did not disappoint. The layers of flavors and combinations of soft to crunchy are out of this world. Not to mention the fresh ingredients! Make sure to like their IG page or Facebook and show them to get your free sushi pen!  We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I am beyond impressed with how their sushi burrito turned out! It was my first time and I asked for the most popular thing (Hey Reb sushi burrito) with a side of ponzu sauce and it was sooooo bomb! For a sushi lover, the size of this burrito is amazing compared to its price! I paid $8 and some change! The crunch on the outside from the flakes was perfect and also the crunchy wontons in the middle was a perfect combination to texture in the burrito. I will say that I did not like the unagi skin. But that's also probably because I almost ate the whole thing and we all know how we feel when we eat too much sushi  awesome place! Can't wait to try other things!"}
{"text":"Great time. We sat at the bar and the staff was very friendly. Had the rocky no rice roll which was delicious! The dynamite bocho bite was absolutely amazing, great presentation too. We also had Escolar sashimi which was very fresh and very well presented. At the end we had the yellow tail jalapeño bocho bite which was absolutely ammmmmaaaazzzzinnng
Recommend this place any time! Is very clean and has nice decorations. Not to mention their on tap sake which is delicious"}
{"text":"Very prompt service but everyone who worked there looked like they hated their jobs. Things were a bit overpriced BUT the sushi burrito was delicious. I gobbled it up. I'd definitely go back if things were more reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Soho Sushi Burrito is located in the same plaza as Maui Rose Hawaiian BBQ, Subway and McDonald's. Soho Sushi Burrito is located specifically next door to Red Wing with plenty of parking spots available.

My husband and I came by here last Saturday around 1:15 pm for lunch. After browsing the menu board, we ended up getting:

Build Your Own Poke Bowl With Ahi Tuna, $7.95 prior to tax- The way the build your own bowls work is that you pay for the bowl based on the price of whatever protein you choose. If you want to get a 2nd protein, you pay for the most expensive and then an additional $1.50 for the 2nd protein. I opted for my bowl to be made with half brown rice, half salad. I got all of the free add ins that are not spicy (I don't do spicy). I thought my bowl was hearty and filling. I liked the creamy sesame dressing (I requested for a light amount in my bowl). The ahi tuna was fresh tasting.

North Shore Poke Bowl, $7.50 prior to tax- My husband opted for one of the premade bowls. I should have asked the employee behind the counter to add salad to his bowl to be a bit more filling and round it out with some more fiber. I got this bowl for my husband to be made with brow rice (you have the option to have this made with white rice or salad or do a mix like my made your own bowl). My husband liked the fresh flavors of the fish in his bowl. 

Taro Milk Tea, $3 prior to tax- This restaurant now offers milk tea, with an option to add boba for an additional $0.50. Unfortunately because these drinks are premade, sweetness level is not able to be adjusted. Only added ice can be added to help dilute the sweetness. My husband got this drink but it was a little on the sweet side. 

Lychee Green Tea, $3 prior to tax- I opted for this tea drink. I also thought it was on the sweet side and so I just added water to my drink to lower the sweetness level. I felt this drink was refreshing and a great price. 
-----------------------
(Total= $23.22 after tax)

Service was friendly. WiFi was available and was fast for those surfing the net. The restroom in the back was clean and adequately stocked with the essentials. 

Overall, we had a great lunch experience and would come back here again if I lived in the area."}
{"text":"I normally don't like sushi but this place has a grilled chicken sushi burrito that was so good"}
{"text":"Stumbled into this place by accident.  Was going to \"Landrys\" but they are closed, thus saw this in the same building complex.  Super great idea and great prices too!  ordered one burrito for myself and it was pretty big and was thinking i wouldn't be able to finish it.  It was excellent and i will definitely be going back.  The traffic coming into that place is non-stop and i can see why.  Quick staff, and hardly any wait time.  They've go it down!  For a quick bite of sushi thats also delicious, try this place!  The only thing better would be more locations of the same."}
{"text":"YUMMY!!! 

So happy that Chef John opened up a spot for lunch and on our side of town. The poke bowls are delish and they are very generous with the toppings. The fish is very fresh as always. If you haven't checked out his other spots, you'll have to check them out. Anything from Chef John is fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"So earlier today, my girlfriend and I were in the mood for a pokebowl, and seeing how soho was just down the street from where we were, we decided to go down there!

Unfortunately after eating the bowl, we realized that the spicy tuna may have been a bit bad. After eating there, we've had stomach pains all night! 

Not only was the spicy tuna a bit bad, the steak tasted fairly old, and brown rice was a bit undercooked(some grains were still pretty hard).

Don't get me wrong, I love eating at soho Japanese restaurant but we definetly won't be coming back to soho sushi burrito."}
{"text":"After an early flight from San Francisco to Las Vegas and a long wait of representing clients at their Immigration interview, I was ravishing and wanted to try something different. A colleague recommended this place and I was not disappointed. The place is clean, staffs are great and courteous and more importantly, the food I ordered- caterpillar bowl is delicious! Definitely a healthier option compared to the strip or the airport. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Used uber eats to order from here. One of the hidden gems in Vegas to eat from. Burritos look small but 1 or 1 and a half should be really filling. Will Definitely come back the next time I visit!"}
{"text":"I am addicted to sushi, and this place rocks. It's a little cheaper than an actual sushi restaurant, and the amt. of food is perfect. I would love it if they brought one to Pahrump. Hint hint. I would be a very loyal customer. The fish is very fresh too. Stellar."}
{"text":"This place is great!! Good food and fast service. Especially for to go orders through Uber Eats. Orders are always ready when you get there and delivery is quick. This is how a small restaurant should operate!"}
{"text":"This place is legit.  Ate at a sushi burrito place in California before that was really good too.  But what we liked about this place is that it actually fused both sushi and Mexican in a way that was very tasty.  The other location just tasted like a big giant sushi roll, which was good too.  But I give Soho props for really making it unique and fusing both types of food in a way you can satisfy your sushi and burrito cravings at the same time.  They are new, so didn't find their menu online at the time, but we went and ordered pick up with ease.  Recommended"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Sushi burrito there is nothing el to say lol. This line service concept is taking over in Vegas! With tacos, pizza and know sushi. And I think is good as long as the offer fresh and good quality products! This last time I went it was raining and the place was packed mostly people on their 20's and not many families line move very fast which is always appreciated,"}
{"text":"This place is overly hyped and reviews don't reflect quality, taste, and pictures.  Do not come here unless you are really craving sushi!  The chicken teriyaki taste like they got it from the subway next door.  They don't know how to roll a burrito tightly.  Service was good and friendly staff though."}
{"text":"The most amazing fusion EVER in my opinion! The prices are amazing since poke in California is about 8 bucks for a small. The way they make their burritos is just like a chipotle but the price for my firecracker burrito was 5.50 a chipotle burrito is 8 bucks!! This has to come to California It would be a huge success!!! And for the people who aren't a fan of sea weed you can always have the substitute of soy paper."}
{"text":"This place is SO good! This is my 2nd time and am still raving about it. I got the 3 amigo roll/burrito - subbed shrimp yempura for the salmon no cilantro added yum yum SO GOOD! food is fresj and delicious. My son got the firecracker and loved it. I. Ant say enough great things about the food. Come try it!"}
{"text":"Well this was a great choice for a post workout lunch.  The concept of a sushi burrito obviously triggered my curiosity, so why not ! It's a small lil hole in the wall , a little hard to find as there is construction going on, so the store front isn't quite clear from a distance.  Once found , there is no going back !!
We ordered the 3amigos and angry tuna burrito and you can choose seaweed or soy paper.  The paper is lined with rice then filled with sushi grade fish and awesomely complimented with Mexican flare ! The fish was fresh and the salsa was as well.  Both were delicious and very filling!! I could easily share one \"burrito\" and be full, well for a little bit at least . We ordered the housemade taro chips as well and they were crisp and seasoned with a jalepeno type flavor ! So so good ! Great spot , average price but you get a ton of food . Place fills up fast but it'a no wonder !!"}
{"text":"I hope something like this comes to my home town of Baltimore because I'm still craving another sushi burrito! Loved the concept, a chipotle style place with different fish and meat plus veggie toppings that are wrapped in seaweed or soy paper for a sushi like experience. I was impressed by how fresh all the ingredients were! Plus they have an awesome machine that compresses your roll at the end to make sure it doesn't fall apart. I tried the spicy tuna which was delicious and don't forget to add a sauce! (Loved the screaming o, chipotle mayo and wasabi aoli). The best part is the very fair and reasonable prices! May have to go again before leaving Las Vegas... 

P.s try the homemade taro chips!"}
{"text":"Went here by accident and Good Lord for this day had to experience my very first sushi Burrito. Omggg i gotta say thats the best thing i've ever eaten so far my entire life. And NEVER regret going here to get it. I got the Philadelphia roll setup, but with shrimp tempura. I will def. go back here and actually thinking on going back later!!! Server was excellent too!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!  It's a really good price I got 3amigos was good combination of some sashimi 
got it on a tortilla and was soooo yummy!"}
{"text":"This place is better than the Badura location. The server walked a woman in front of me through the menu bc it was her first time here. I wasn't annoyed or anything - just made me think, that's great customer service. I live close to the Badura location but the reason I don't go much is bc they're stingier w portions. Not this place!! They are super generous w proteins and fixings!! Way to please your customers!! I was so happy I got a meal this time. Thanks Soho for keeping me happy. No stomach aches from the fish here yet and I trust it'll stay that way."}
{"text":"Best sushi burrito ever! I had no idea what to get as I was a first timer. The girl working was so helpful!!! She helped me customize my burrito and it was BOMB! If you ever want a great custom burrito option I ordered: 
Unagi
Soft shell crab
Shrimp tempura
Lettuce
Cucumber
Seaweed salad
Unagi sauce
Chipotle mayo sauce
Tempura crunch"}
{"text":"* Setting? Open and like a sub/sandwich place.
* Prices reasonable? YES
* Nice service? YES
* Yummm? YES
* Place was quiet? YES
* Would I go back? YES
* Restrooms clean? YES
* Tips? Build your own

This is a great place. Its way outside of the city and I went seeing that there were a lot of great reviews and the travel was not close to the city that people must travel to eat delicious good. I wanted to eat off the strip and wanted a sushi burrito. I was happy and pleased I went. Not much to write besides that you should probably build your own and they definitely load ypu up with the meat! That is a perk in my eyes/belly. The happy/smiley girls behind the counter dont hurt either making the day that much more brighter. :) Enjoy and happy bellies!"}
{"text":"After being quite the fan of Soho on 215/Jones for their happy hour, i knew I had to eventually come here to try one day, after finding out its by the same owner. The entrance/mall is under renovation but look for the SOHO sign in the middle of the building. 

I came here for lunch when i had some extra time before my appointments on Sunday around 1230. Pretty busy, quite the few people in line. Set up reminds me of chipotle where you order and go down the line (if its not one of their pre-designed combinations). They have 11 \"predesigned\" combinations. If you don't like any of their pre-designed combinations, you can order by the process below

----------------------------------

1- What do u like?? - Bowl, Nacho, Burrito (Seaweed Paper, Soy Paper, Flour Tortilla, Wheat Tortilla) 

2 - How do u like it ?? - Burrito & Bowl (Sushi rice, Brown rice, White Rice, Mixed Greens - Bowl only), Nacho (Corn chips, House Made Taro Chips +$1.00) 

3 - Add Proteins - Additional protein extra $1.50 Each

$5.50 - Spicy Tuna, Surimi Crab, Sweet Omelet, Tofu
$6.50 - Salmon, Grilled Chicken, Shrimp Tempura
$7.50 - Ahi Tuna, Yellowtail, Grilled Steak, Grilled Salmon, Soft Shell Crab, Gardein Asada

4 - Splash Some Sauce

House Blend - Chedder Cheese Sauce, Creamy Cilantro, Honey Habenero, Mango Soy, Poke Sauce, Screaming \"O\", Sweet Chili, Sweet Chipotle Mayo, Shiso Tormatillo, Unagi Sauce, Wasabi Aioli, Yuzu Ponzu

Special Blend - GF/VG Chipotle Mayo, GF/VG Ponzu, GF/VG Sweet Chili, GF/VG Wasabi Aioli, VG Mango Soy, VG Unagi Sauce

GF = Gluten Free
VG = Vegan 

5 - Pick It... It's on Us !!! - Baby Spinach, Bell Pepper, Cabbage, Cilantro, Cucumber, Green Onion, Jalapeno, Lettuce, Mixed Greens, Pico de Gallo, Red Onion, Roasted Corn, Tomato, Crispy Wonton Strips, Tempura Crunch

Sorry... on you - Avocado, Cream Cheese, Guacamole, Masago, Seaweed Salad 

---------------------------------------

Since this was my first time, decided to try one of their pre-designed ones. I had ordered the 
3 Amigos which included Ahi Tuna, Yellowtail, Salmon, cucumber, red onion, cilantro, masago, crispy wonton strips, and wasabi aioli. 

I also opted to get the house made taro chips as well as im a super fan of taro and oooh chips :D Lol 

After adding a drink, i was a little short of $16. To be honest, when i paid, i was like oh man that was kinda pricey for a meal that doesn't look like will get me full... 

3 Amigos is $10.95, Taro Chips is $1.99, and drink is $1.55. So no benefit on \"combo'ing\" if you dont want chips and/or drink. 

The taro chips were flavored with some seasoning... If anything, it reminded me of like a sort of msg like seasoning you find on some chinese crackers and what not. Taro chips itself is great. Eating with the included \"nacho cheese\" is a bit weird of a combination

The 3 Amigos was pretty decent. I got pretty full (SURPRISINGLY). Cucumber gives it a nice freshness and crisp to the \"heavy\" tuna, yellowtail, and salmon. Masago is a nice touch with the \"popping\" but the most surprising thing was the crispy wonton strips. I didnt think id like the wonton strips but it surprisingly works well. Couldn't tell much of the wasabi aioli though. Overall, just tasted creamy? LOL xD 

Overall, not bad. Maybe ill try to make my own thing next time."}
{"text":"Name changed but still JaBurritos owner and product!

I came back today and I LOVE the changes made to the menu names. I love how all the vegetarian options are listed together and there is even one called \"Vegan Lover\" now! I give this place a 4.5 star now! I always know what I want but people who are not familiar can simply choose a veggie choice now! +.5 stars :) 

I'm going to post what I had written a few weeks ago because the product nor my item choice has changed:::::
I'm a huge fan of Sushiritto in SF.
Well now I'm spoiled because I have SOHO less than ten minutes from my house!

Super vegan or veggie friendly. I get the Gardein steak, spicy vegan mayo, nori paper, sushi rice, and alllllllllll the veggies! 

Veggie menu choices are easy to select from.

I love all the flavors combined. At first I was like \"grilled corn and steak flavor in my sushiritto, hell no.\" But I tried it and it's sooooo yummy! I am a huge seaweed salad lover so I usually unwrap and add some seaweed salad. And of course while I'm unwrapped I add ginger and wasabi! I like it spicy!

I have also tried a bite of a vegan Mex style, the Gardein steak, grilled corn, lettuce, pico, spicy vegan mayo, avocado, tomatoes, soy paper wrap, brown rice. It was also good! My husband usually gets something like that because he is NOT a fan of anything sushi smelling, no nori or wasabi for him! 

I have gotten my combo bowl style also but there is just something yummy and comfort food with that burrito style. Maybe because all the extra tortilla calories?!?! Oh well, just eat it.

The line can get super long at lunchtime so I usually go around 1-2pm weekdays. Never been on a weekend. Since its new I'm sure it's a total madhouse. 

Soooooo yummy just go and get one right now!"}
{"text":"Lemme first say.... the line is super long!!!! I got here at 11:05, 5 minutes after opening, and I still waited 45 minutes to get my food and pay for everything.

If you're thinking about calling ahead to order, don't even sweat! They don't answer the phones because they're too busy fulfilling orders and everyone is super fast, trying to get to the next one.

I ordered the 3Amigos on Seaweed, but I sub the white rice to a brown one. Despite the addition of Jalapeños and replacing the Wasabi Aioli with Chipotle Mayo, it's still not spicy enough for me. I'll probably try a different variation next time I go.

You can also order online, which is pretty convenient. I just don't know how long it's gonna take to get everything ready as each one has at least 10 per receipt."}
{"text":"Let me just tell you guys something? They take heaven and turn it into sushi dreams in the shape of burritos 

 3 amigos. 
Last one on the menu with shrimp.
Try the green tea or sweet southern tea (i know its iced tea, but idk, just damn good tea)
 
Really fulfills all sushi cravings.  Add kim-chi to any burrito for $.50 every time I walk into this restaurant the whole staff is so genuinely welcoming, kind,  and I don't know where they keep finding all these great employees, honestly! I do recommend getting a meal, you have an option of getting a drink and then seaweed salad or mochi. I tried the mochi for the first time today and it's fresh and really powdery and perfect.  

I will add that I've tried a couple around town and this is still the best one. Price wise, and they steer you in the right direction instead of giving you overwhelming amounts of options."}
{"text":"Amazing! The line was out the door. You can order off the menu or create your own. The flavors are legit and fresh. One burrito got be through two meals so the $10.50 price was extra awesome. The toro chips and cheese . There's some sort of fine lime, sugar seasoning they put on the chips that causes an addiction issue that you don't fight against. Just go with it  this place makes me happy dance just thinking about it."}
{"text":"I finally got the chance to try out this concept of a sushi burrito! It was the hype for awhile, but I never got the chance to try it. 

During lunch time, there is kinda a long line, but it moves fast. I ordered the triple s sushi burrito and it was delicious! I will definitely come back and try something new.

The place is clean, and the staff provides excellent customer service. I'd definitely recommend this place to everyone! If you love sushi, this is the place for you, with a different twist. :)"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and it has always been delicious.  The burritos are well-filled and the selection is large.  Looking forward to another visit."}
{"text":"Third time was definitely the charm. I had come here before on two separate occasions and ordered the twin dragon burrito and then a twin dragon on lettuce (I gave up carbs for a couple weeks). Neither of those two options satisfied my palette and thought that my love for sushi was lost. 

Then I decided the last time I went that I would just change what I ordered and decided on something simple. I got the fire cracker which is spicy tuna and a honey chipotle sauce with some garnishes, amazing! 

Now I'm thinking \"maybe my tastebuds are just simple\" the Twin drag had a lot going on and a lot of flavors that didn't connect with me. It's in a large shopping center, but folks love this place for lunch, and now me too! I appreciate the option to go vegetarian, and the other options for the kids. Definitely a go to place if you love sushi like I do, and would like fusion for lunch."}
{"text":"So many bowls, so little time! Well, this is the original .. at least their other location was.  I never had a chance to try the original - so, one day I had Uber Eats bring me this.  Ehhhhh, nothing special.  But wait ...

One day I was starving and craving a poke bowl. Sure, why not .. I did it - got a Hilo Bowl to go with a Miso Soup.

Wow, yummmmmm.   

Staff was friendly - greeted me when I entered and left. Asked what extras I wanted in my bowl -  then the fun part ... I ate it!    YUMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM."}
{"text":"I love the build your own options the unagi bowl is one of my favorites great topping selection and the kimchi aioli is so yummy!"}
{"text":"It wasn't that good. I get that fish is expensive in the desert but way overpriced for a simple bowl. The rice wasn't good and the fish wasn't as fresh as it should be. Not a fan."}
{"text":"I love it!! At first I was like, \"Hoooow?\" and then I was like... \"Okayyyyy! I'm feeling this!\" My friends and I ordered: 
The Triple S burrito style, The Fire Cracker bowl style, and the TwinDragon Nacho style. 

All of it was amazing! Especially the home-made Taro chips served with their cheddar cheese dipping sauce. 

Service was very patient. I mean, something so new to the district will always bring curious clients with several questions. So thumbs up to them for dealing with that, lol. 

I think anyone who loves sushi should try them out. Worth it. 

No picture, we ate it before we could take it!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here over 10 times and just love this place. Try Soho you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"While staying at the Palace Station I found this place on Yelp, and this is why I love Yelp!  This whole sushi burrito fusion concept is totally new to me and I'm speechless. Wow! How have I never eaten here before? 

The location is directly behind Landry's Seafood joint in a little strip mall and the facade is currently under construction, but don't let that detour you. The line was long, which is always a good sign. 

I had the 3 Amigos, which consisted of tuna, yellow tail and salmon wrapped in seaweed and sushi rice. AMAZING!! I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My Soho bowl was so fresh and yummy. Filled with exactly everything I love...because i built my own...lol.
While the young guy who made my order was obviously rather be somewhere else instead of working, the Asian lady was very pleasant and helpful. 
Thankfully i got there after the lunch rush...there was no line. Parking  was super easy too.
Definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Great food! Excellent customer service. A must try! You'll go again and again! We had the 3 Amigos and Twin dragon. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is a great place if you like Hawaiian poke and the service is fast.  They make great bowls as well. The location is inconvenient. I don't find myself on Sahara and the 15 fwy often."}
{"text":"OMG why do I have to drive all the way to Las Vegas to obtain what has to be one of the greatest fusion ideas of this century?  If you call making a giant sushi roll while calling it a burrito \"fusion,\" that is!  Either way, it's pure genius and extremely YUMMY.

I went with the recommendation of the employee working the creation station ordered a couple of the more popular burritos.  And I learned why they are popular.

First, the Twin Dragon - Shrimp Tempura, Spicy Tuna, Surimi Crab, Lettuce, Cucumber, Guacamole, Crispy Wonton Strips, Sweet Chipotle Mayo, Unagi Sauce.  It was a great size and the flavor was also amazing.  

Second, the 3 Amigos - Ahi Tuna, Yellowtail, Salmon, Cucumber, Red Onion, Cilantro, Masago, Crispy Wonton Strips, Wasabi Aioli.  If I could do this again I would skip or get less wasabi.  Otherwise, 100% pure awesome. 

I'm really surprised there aren't places like this in Southern California. There are many, many poke places but no pokeburrito places! I'm sure if there were a few it would be off the hook.  And to the extent that there may be places like this in California, I haven't seen one that does it anywhere near as well as this place.

In any case, this location has now become a mandatory stop on all Las Vegas trips. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: This review is based on one visit, and I will visit again and update my score at that time.

I give this place 3 stars. It might even be 2 stars. 

I got the Twin Dragon, and though it might have been good, I couldn't get over the fact that it was super salty. I couldn't figure out if it was because of the seaweed salad I added, or the sauce, or maybe it was the spicy tuna or crab mix. Either way, it was just too salty. I couldn't enjoy my food. 

Meanwhile, my friends really enjoyed their 3 Amigos. I regretted not getting it, but I also didn't want the wasabi aioli that was in it. In hind sight, I guess I could've gotten a different sauce with it.

My other friend went to the other location on Jones, and had the Twin Dragon and enjoyed it. I think I just had a bad batch. I will give it one more try before I completely dismiss this place. It doesn't seem like a bad place to eat. The food was fresh, service was quick, and workers were pretty friendly. 

Based on the overall experience that I had, in collaboration with my friends, I won't say it was a complete disaster. I was comforted by the mochi ice cream, that was pretty delicious. Again I will give it another try soon."}
{"text":"My usually go to lunch spot! I usually get their poke bowls and taro chips with cheese, delicious! I have tried their sushi burritos and they were pretty good to! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I realize it's \"trendy\" but it's still DELISH!  I've been a few times now and tried something new each time.  I definitely love the 3amigos the best!   It's a fun take on Sushi and there's always a line - for good reason.  It moves quickly so don't panic - just get your spot and enjoy this filling, fresh and fun concept."}
{"text":"This is a great place to get a good sushi burrito for a decent price. They are friendly and have lots of different options."}
{"text":"First time there. Loved it! Ordered Twin Dragon and Triple S. I liked the Triple way better. I got it on seaweed and I'll probably do soy next time. If I do the Twin Dragon again, I'll leave the Guac off, it didn't match the rest of the ingredients in my opinion. If you like sushi, it's a must go. Just be ready for a nap afterwards! #SoFull!"}
{"text":"I love super fat Sushi rolls. The concept of a Sushi burrito is just brilliant for anyone like myself that loves Sushi! The price is just right and I always get full.  Whenever I go to a Sushi restaurant I end up spending an arm and a leg for sushi roll after sushi roll. Soho Sushi gives me just enough to fill me up and satisfied that I was able to get my Sushi Fix. The staff is sweet and always willing to make suggestions to new comers. The Sushi is fresh and tastes delicious! I always order the Fire Cracker Burrito because I like it spicy. Yum! YOU HAVE GOT TO CHECK THIS PLACE OUT if you love sushi! Love, Love, Love This place!"}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant out last week & it was amazing food.. You can create your own sushi, stuffed in either paper soy (my favorite) or tortilla.  Had the spicy ahi tuna & looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Place was clean and food was good tried the twin dragon was really good first time to try a sushi burrito.. would be back for sure and will try the other stuff they have to offer."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, we just found this place. it is down the street from our house . We found out about this place around 2 months ago and we go there at least 2 times a week... they are always so friendly there and kind.. food is so tasty and so what if they charge $0.50 extra per item there Scoops are huge....."}
{"text":"We had the BEST lunch delivered to our trade show booth last week from here! The food is incredible!! Had the Three Amigos wrap. I wish we had a Soho SushiBurrito in Seattle! Craving more!"}
{"text":"Love his place wish it was bigger. But I think it's like the subway of sushi. Super cool take. I have worked in a sushi restaurant and I felt like their fish was fresh. Totally worth the price. Wish their was one closer to home"}
{"text":"The good was amazing!  We tried the sunny salmon and cheesy asada and both were perfect!"}
{"text":"My new favorite place!!! Im a local and am tired of the same food , this is fresh and you cannot go wrong with sushi and burrito :)"}
{"text":"First reviewer. Finally here?   kind of suspect.  It's been there since it opened in October.  Love this place but it seems like you were a set up or a paid review.    :P
Second reviewer... it's just Jaburrito with a new name.   lol    

  Yelp people are funny.   

   This place is very good for amazing, light and SUPER fresh food.   Been here at least 6 times since they have opened and am never disappointed. All my friends and co-workers are now repeat customers as well.    

   Simply put, if you like sushi rolls, you'll love it.  They don't look like they are big enough to get full but they are surprisingly dense and filling.    Try the Taro chips as well. They are dusted with magic.  :)"}
{"text":"AIRA is the name of the employee why I wouldn't go to Soho anymore. She's the one in charge of putting the rice in the bowl/burrito. She is absolutely rude and talks about their customers with her coworkers. She and her coworkers talk through their eyes whenever they see something funny. Mind you AIRA, you have a job because of the customers, not because of your employer. So you better start treating customers right or just get out of the food service business. 

I've been coming to Soho for quite some time now because I like the rice bowls. I wouldn't recommend the burrito bec it is overstuffed and it falls apart easily. My favorite was Sunny Salmon with sweet chipotle mayo, ponzu sauce, extra cucumbers, cilantro and corn. Their taro chips with furikake is the bomb! (Without the cheese sauce) Soho is my go-to place when I'm craving for sushi and when I got no time for AYCE. 

Unfortunately, they've lost a loyal customer today. Nobody wants to be coming in to a place and feel awkward at all! Talked to manager Lily over the phone and told me she would handle the situation. She was actually honest to say that other customers had other issues with the employees. If so, it reflects the training ground they had! Who's to blame now?"}
{"text":"Huge fan of this place. Super fresh and flavorful food. They have coke products. You could say they have it together. My favorite is the caterpillar. They offer a student discount. They offer rewards. My wife and I come here all of the time and it never gets old."}
{"text":"Yummy place. 
Great healthy fast food 
Got the high maintenance burrito but made it into a bowl. Yellow tail and spicy tune. 
So good. 
Staff is also great."}
{"text":"Great concept, why didn't I think of this sooner. Great customer service, fast and clean. 

3 Amigos:  
5/5 stars
 
Triple S:
 2/5
-Chipotle sauce is too sweet unless you like sweets this is for you. They let customers change sauces
-Can't taste the soft shell crab, too much batter or the crab is too small :(

Overall I'd come back, but choose my own style."}
{"text":"This place is gooder than a mug. Everybodys chill. Shoutout to everybody thats chill here."}
{"text":"This location isn't as friendly or efficient as the UNLV one, but the fish is fresh and the high customer volume keeps the place lively. We picked this Sahara location because it was near our destination and had a lot of positive reviews. I got my usual Sunny Salmon and it was good, although it needed more even distribution of ingredients, which was compromised because the burrito didn't roll tightly enough. I would go back if I'm in this area again!"}
{"text":"I got the Soho Bowl with sushi rice, poke sauce, salmon, avocado, cucumber and masago. The sauce was alright and I was not expecting warm sushi rice. Everyone was very friendly and the line went by fast. I've definitely had way better poke bowls than this but their service was great."}
{"text":"Not bad for a sushi burrito place in Vegas. The have a good variety to choose from and a lotttt of ingredients that they put into your burrito as well. The place is a bit small but overall, the food was great. The only thing is I didn't like how the ends are open, cus the stuff in my burrito kept coming out every time I took a bite ):"}
{"text":"Sushirittos are the best! I had my first one here. Usually some of the menu items already come mild so don't get it too spicy. This place is great to try your first Sushiritto. About 10$ for one roll which is enough to fill you up."}
{"text":"Love this place for a healthy lunch option. Would be 5 stars but their water from the soda machine has a terrible taste, like dirty pipes. PLEASE look into this."}
{"text":"This place is so delicious! Great prices to get your sushi fix!
Clean establishment with plenty of parking. Friendly employees ready to rock and roll to get you exactly what you want.
They have tons of suggested items but feel free to MAKE YOUR OWN.
I  made my own burrito with seaweed as the outside and they have a fancy machine that perfectly places sushi rice nice and flat so you can get the maximum toppings loaded up!
Losts of proteins and veges available.

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND GETTING TEMPURA CRUNCH FLAKES ADDED. This added an incredibly crunchy texture that you may not normally experience on a sushi roll.

They don't skimp AT ALL.
That burrito was amazing and busting at the seems.

* they also serve bowls and side items like edamame and miso soup"}
{"text":"I can't find my pictures of my lunch... Probably because I couldn't wait long enough to take a picture! I got my lunch and dug right in!! Love there \"burritos\"!  Great, fresh,  quality ingredients!!! I can't remember the name of our burrito but we took the advise of one of the chef's and the flavors were perfect together!! So many yummy choices!! We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Found this place on our recent trip to Vegas. It's fantastic. Who knew sushi and Mexican would go so amazingly well together? We had the firecracker. It's a spicy tuna burrito of goodness. We also had the three amigos - Salmon, tuna, roe and yellowtail. It's basically like pizzaRev or chipotle. They make your burrito right in front if you and you can choose what you want on it. Or you can choose a signature burrito."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if this was the same exact location I went to because my cousin was the driver. But I will tell you that this place is sooo GOOD!!! 
10/23/16: My cousin brought my boyfriend and I to this place. We were visiting from Hawaii and she told me there were poke bowls too so I said \"Sure!\" Got there and I was already amazed that they have sushi burritos!!! And it's for $10.50!!! I could of made my own sushi burrito, but I felt I would be overwhelmed by the things I could put in so I got the Twin Dragon. It came with spicy ahi, shrimp tempura, crab, unagi sauce, and other delicious things that I can't recall. I thought I would still be hungry, but that thing was so filling! We also had their homemade taro chips with cheese sauce and that was good too. If I could change something I would add a soft shell crab in my sushi burrito. I only saw the option after I ordered. Back home it's around the same price, but a little smaller."}
{"text":"I am definitely not a big fan of raw fish but I can definitely eat at Soho any day. There are other choices other than fish and since you can make your own bowl or burrito there's always something new to try. With friendly staff and at such an accessible location it's hard to pass this place up!"}
{"text":"Great concept. Fresh fish. You can make your burrito completely protein style. Staff are very friendly. Very clean."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! My co worker and I found this place while searching Uber Eats. They do not disappoint. The sushi burritos are huge and are worth the price. Always fresh and yummy!"}
{"text":"Idk if it was just me but walking into the store, it didn't feel like any type of A/C was on. Just the fans. It was hot!!! 

Anyways, I wanted to try this place because a lot of sushi burrito places/poke places have been opening lately & this one was down the road. I like Jaburritos and this one had the same concept (chipotle style).

You choose from a menu for a signature burrito/bowl or you can B.Y.O. (build your own). I chose to build my own and my BF chose a twin dragon burrito.

I chose to build a bowl w/ shrimp tempura, spicy tuna & yellowtail on sushi rice.

For my sauces I put chipotle mayo, sesame soy & Unagi sauce 

The service was 7/10. It was really hard to hear the workers who took your order. They need to speak up because I couldn't hear them thru the glass and it just sounded like they were mumbling to me. 

Also, the tables put together are so tiny that the chairs don't even fit so I had to remove a chair and place it on the outer edge of the table lol 

Overall, it was tasty. But there wasn't anything special about it."}
{"text":"Excellent service, good food and reasonable prices. My family was starving when we arrived in Vegas and the line at the Oyster Bar was way long. We needed something quick and Soho Sushi Burrito hit the spot. It even has vegetarian options. And $3 Sapporos! Anyhow, we were very happy with our food and experience. 

But keep in mind this is a casual place - order and they make your food as you walk down the line (Subway, Chipotle style). Pay at the register and find your seat."}
{"text":"Never had a sushi burrito before and saw this on Yelp with great reviews and thought I have to go try it. Definitely did not disappoint. It was very similar to Chipotle but it also has prebuilt bowls you can choose from as well. We end up getting the high maintenance bowl and the fire cracker burrito. The burrito was amazing and the combo was delicious. The spicy tuna was on the salty side but it was compensated by the ginger that I added on. There's also a small side bar where you can get some ginger, wasabi, mild sauce, soy sauce, siracha and some jalapeno. The fish was not super fresh but still very good. Overall, I would definitely come back or wish there would be one that open in Seattle. Would definitely come back"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the sushi burrito ! It's a very neat place , they assemble the food so perfectly , theirs a machine that tightens the burrito and compacts the food is pretty awesome ! must drop by and check them out !"}
{"text":"Very impressed with this place!! We are fromPalm Springs and don't have anything like this near by. Deff treat! The burritos were great! I had the Caterpillar and my fiancé had the Fire Cracker. The staff was great and friendly! Down to earth. I wish there were places like this near Palm Springs. Hint hint, open one out there ;)"}
{"text":"Amazing! First time I've had a sushi burrito and it was just the best I've had!! I got the twin dragon, which they said was their number one best seller, and I can see why. The spicy tuna was actually spicy, and the crab was delicious! Honestly all the flavors went together so well, it was so good. For the price as well, I got mine for $10.50, and I thought that was perfect. Overall, I would come back over and over."}
{"text":"So good. Love all the options they have. Staff is super friendly and very knowledgeable on their menu and can help you to decide what to get if you haven't eaten there before. Cost is reasonable and food is fresh and very tasty. Only thing is the restaurant could be a little cleaner to my standards. I went in at 11:30 am and some tables needed to be wiped down. Also feel that they should put some booths inside for dinning. I will be back though"}
{"text":"I can't remember what exactly I ordered. I do remember the fish was fresh and the delivery was quick."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try a sushiburrito (since I love sushi). I like how there is a variety of choices on the menu. You can go with your own creation or signature burritos. The sushi as well as the ingredients were all fresh and delicious. The taro chips with cheese sauce is really good - I would recommend it. My coworkers and I got there a little earlier than noon and the service was quick. Heads up -  It gets really busy at lunch though."}
{"text":"Disgusting...who puts fish in a tortilla?  I went there with a group. I about gagged on this food. Went to Starbucks and got an overpriced. Protein bowl..."}
{"text":"So fresh and so tasty.  Definitely the best sushi burrito in town.  Sushi burrito is my favorite fast food now. Most places don't use high quality seafood or their sushi is soaked in heavy dressing. This is the best"}
{"text":"Soho burrito is a branch off of Soho the restaurant. This place is legit. It's pretty much like a sushi place with the Chipotle concept. You can customize your own sushi burrito or order a specialty burrito off their menu. They make the burritos right in front of you so you can see then put the ingredients in your burrito. If you prefer to have a bowl instead you can opt for that option. Also for your burrito you can have it wrapped in soy paper or seaweed.

The fish is really fresh and the sauces are amazing. They have a dozen different sauces you can add to your burrito or bowl. Try their different sauces to fit your taste buds. 5 stars for awesome food and service!"}
{"text":"A Mexican & Japanese fusion baby made in heaven!

I'm a fan! Let's begin with the value here! You get a monster sushi burrito that's cheaper than most rolls at a sushi restaurant that are tiny compared to this sucker. Crazy!

These burritos are HUGE! I can never finish one! 

You can order one of their awesome creations and my favorite happens to be the twin dragon (minus the lettuce and I substitute the guacamole for slivers of avocado and sometimes I add seaweed salad). The ingredients are always fresh and they give you lots of fish! The rice ratio is nothing compared to the goodies! Check out my pics...

You can also build your own and pick whatever your heart desires and they also offer bowls and cooked ingredients like chicken & steak with nacho cheese sauce! :) 

This place is always busy as they should be. Order ahead if you're rushing..."}
{"text":"So delicious they have solved all my problems delicious sushi on the go. Quick fresh food great service I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and awesome service! The guys are always great. 'Triple S' bow is a MUST try *warning* it's a little spicy but so good!!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place for lunch!!  Prices are comparable to Subway and way better!!  Check it out!  You'll be pleased!  Call ahead about a half an hour before you leave to pick up, the line is always LONG!  You can build your own buritto or bowl!  One worx \"AWEDOME\"!"}
{"text":"10/10 would eat again. Prices are reasonable for the amazing product, it's roughly equivalent to what you're used to paying for a sushi roll wherever you're from. Also enjoyed done kimchi on the side which is fabulous, great balanced flavor. Ate firecracker, catapillar and angry tuna burritos with my wife. Check it out for sure whether you're on the strip or not."}
{"text":"Came in not knowing what to expect. ...only cause you read some good reviews and the place ends up being a dump! Not here though! The menu is a self explanatory and the items are extremely fresh. It's a surprising new twist on sushi at least to me I love burritos and I love sushi you  marry the 2 and you get SOHO. Beautiful experience near the strip. Atmosphere is good and you only feel good vibes in this place. Customer service was great and fast. Only draw back is the place is kinda small at our visit it was packed but some tables were empty but I'm sure at lunch time no room to sit. Outstanding place to get a bite to eat. I will definitely come back and HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."}
{"text":"i want so much to like this place. this is the 3rd time we've tried it & the 2nd time they've messed up our order. & this is using Uber Eats so what do you do by the time it finally gets to you?! the food is good & the portions are good when they get it right. seems like they don't pay enough attention to their order tickets. very inconsistent. one photo is my husbands bowl completely full, the half empty one is mine. should be full with spinach, cucumbers & tempura crunch but they completely skipped my \"additional toppings\" even though it's clearly stated on the ticket they taped to my bowl. so annoying!"}
{"text":"Yes please.  After having two friends be regulars, we finally had some.  Better yet, had take out and it was fresh and good.  

I had the three amigo without onion or cucumber.  It came as ordered and was So filling.  Very good ratio    I would definitely order again.  

Hubby had the twin dragon and said his was so so.  But he was recommended to get the shrimp and think he would have enjoyed another combo.  He also on recommendation ordered the chips and cheese sauce.  While good I didn't think they added anything to the meal.   

We will definitely make this a quick stop or pick up again."}
{"text":"This place is better then some others. It's a big sushi roll that you stuff in your mouth. I got the 3 amigos, caterpillar, triple S. The 3 amigos had good flavor combination. The caterpillar just miss for its tempura shrimp being too heavy on the tempura batter. I the batter to be light and flaky. The triple S also missed on the tempura batter and not enough soft shell crab. But the worse part is you can't taste anything because of the jalapeño and spicy tuna overpowered everything else.
Service was good."}
{"text":"So delicious, I'm a fan of everything seafood/sushi/poke. Made a bowl with crab, salmon, ahi tuna, mixed greens, seaweed salad, brown sushi rice. So bomb!! They also had $3 Sapporo to top it all off."}
{"text":"This place is so great. Everyone there is really nice, plus the food was amazing! I am from Hawaii so usually I wouldn't like much sushi in the mainland because of how great I have it back home, but this place was super yummy!"}
{"text":"Wish they had mangoes. idk if their a/c broke down that day but it was hot inside the store when i went."}
{"text":"Ever since my friend who lives in San Francisco told me about Sushirrito I told myself I absolutely want a sushi burrito. Now we finally have something just like that here in Vegas. The quality of the fish here is insanelyyy good. My favorite sushi burrito so far here would be the twin dragon. They also have an option of making your own sushi burrito or bowl. Location is a bit odd - it's right across Palace Station on Sahara/Las Vegas Blvd. I would expect this place to be in the same area as Soho Japanese Restaurant. Nevertheless , this is a great place for a casual lunch or dinner if you don't mind spending 9$-15$ on a meal (depending if you make it a combo or not). Will come back again !"}
{"text":"It was a very delicious and delicious experience. I've never been to this place. Better than expected. Really good food. Fresh sushi. I liked this place."}
{"text":"Apparently while I was out of town for the holidays, this spot underwent a name change- same staff, same product and menu, same quality, just a name change to show they'd \"merged with the owner's first restaurant.\" Which was already common knowledge.

The crew that opened SOHO now has this place: sushi, in burritos, some with Mexican influences. Sushi burritos on their own aren't new, the Jogasaki truck from LA rolls into town whenever we have food festivals and Sushirrito is a hit in SF, but I'm glad to see we finally have an option here- especially from a place that does it fresh, fast, and friendly.

Walk up and order, Chipotle-style. Customize your creation in a wrap (soy paper, seaweed, or tortilla) or bowl, with raw fish or simply chicken/beef options. Tortilla or taro chips, edamame, and mochi are also options.

The ROCKPORT is my favorite so far- soft shell crab, spicy tuna, surimi crab, jalapeno, tobiko, cucumer, red onion, chipotle mayo, and sweet anguilla sauce. Every ingredient harmonizes, would maybe add avocado or guac but it's pretty perfect as-is.
The MISSION (salmon, sushi ebi, cream cheese, pico de gallo, tortilla strips, romaine, yuzu guac, and tomatillo shiso sauce) channels some south-of-the-border flavor but seemed to be missing something- maybe add a spicy element like sriracha or jalapenos to perk it up a bit.
The REDONDO was runner up- packed with ingredients I love but somehow not the explosion of flavors my tastebuds had anticipated.
TARO CHIPS: rather heavily seasoned with furikake (and some other stuff?), these were sweeter than expected and served with a cup of toxic-orange gas-station nacho cheese. The sweet-savory combination oddly worked, but I can't say I'd get it again. 

Service is super friendly. Vibe is crazy-positive. This location is way more convenient to me than SOHO, so I'll probably pop by pretty often. Average price per signature 'rrito is ~$11, and they are filling."}
{"text":"#1 Fan here!!!! They just had their grand opening today, and yesterday Chef John gave free food to EVERYONE who came to the restaurant. Who does that? Chef John has designed a restaurant with excellent food, super affordable menu items, with excellent customer service from staff. I've been going to his Sahara location for a year and I love the new menu items at this location. (My favorite is the ginger beef bowl). 

I expect to eat here 3-4 times a week because the food is great (Chef John told me his fish is imported from the same supplier as the casinos on the strip). They also have excellent food handling consistency. Out of the hundreds of times I've eaten at the Sahara locations, I can only remember once or twice when the brown rice was a little under cooked, but everything is generally perfect. 

Consistency, excellent customer service, low price point, huge selection of food items? I don't think I need to cook for a Looooong time.

Thank you Chef John for the excellent food you bring to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I'm the #1 Fan!!! Been going to this place for a year and staff is super friendly and nice. They had these awesome discount cards that they gave to all new customers until April of this year. The concept of fish and fast food was totally revolutionary and now you see so many poke places popping up across the valley. 

My favorite thing to get here is building my own bowl. I would get a blend of yellowtail / salmon / unagi. The food is fresh and the consistency is always the same. Very very few occasions, the brown rice would be slightly undercooked, but it's very close to perfect each time. 

I used to come here 3-4 times a week, but now a new location opened near my house on Jones and Rainbow, so I'm going to be going to that one more!

Love this place and awesome idea / concept."}
{"text":"Heard about the sushi burrito wasn't sure about the hype. Came here and got the 3amigos and surprisingly it was very tasty! Definitely would come back!"}
{"text":"Heard about the hype and wanted to try out for myself. Definitely coming back when we're in town again! I call it the \"Asian Subway\"

We got the twin dragon burrito, triple S burrito, fire cracker burrito and 4 bags of taro with cheese dip. We shared all that with 5 ppl. Would definitely recommend the taro chips and twin dragon!"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! The twin dragon is awesome but really everything I've tried here is good. If you haven't tried taro chips before, you have to try them here. I don't know what the seasoning it is they use but it's sooo ridiculously tasty!"}
{"text":"Delish. Make your own or get one off the menu. Fresh, yummy. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I am in heaven any time I get to eat here!! Worth the drive, wait and limited seating."}
{"text":"I went to Soho today for lunch and got a bowl. It  was good; fish tasted clean, rice wasn't over cooked and the rest of the ingredients were fresh. 

A clean and healthy meal!"}
{"text":"They have the BEST sushi bowls, you can order online or in store. I usually get the surimi or steak over white rice w/ creamy cilantro & sesame soy sauce, as well as mixed seaweed, baby spinach & the occasional roasted corn. Their portions are huge, I can never finish my food in one serving. Lol. Come here & try their bowls (my recommendation), or their sushi burritos (my coworkers rave over them). Either way, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I heard about this place and thought it sounded pretty good. When we got there, the line was out the door and must have had 50 people in it. We roughed the line, it moved pretty quick, and it was well worth the wait. I loved this place and the food was delicious. I wish they would open one in the Summerlin area."}
{"text":"This location is totally closer to where I live so it's convenient for me but the Sahara location is more organized, the workers know what they're doing, and it's less expensive for some reason. 
It looks the exact same as the Sahara location though and the place is clean and the ambience is nice enough to sit and enjoy lunch. The workers have pretty good service but you can tell they're new workers since they don't completely know the whole menu yet which is okay. 
Their poke bowls are my favorite though, I think the bowls give the best bang for your buck though. I always make my own bowl and some workers make it good and some just mix it all into mush. 
If I'd rate this place I'd rate it 9/10 out of every other sushi burrito in the radius of that area so I wouldn't mind coming here everyday to eat since it is pretty good still. 
They don't offer that much fish so if you want extra it's $1.50 more."}
{"text":"I cannot give 5 stars after only ONE visit. Although, this place exceeded expectations. My sister has been raving about this particular establishment for a number of months. I was in town (Las Vegas) for the weekend and wanted to try this place out!  I have NOTHING negative to say.  The quality of the food, freshness, and service was awesome. We, my family of four enjoyed our servers' upbeat personality and one to stay even keeled throughout.  This was such a nice dinner."}
{"text":"I got the 3 Amigos burrito. The fish was fresh. All around the burrito was amazing. The service was great. If you get a chance and feeling a sushi burrito try this spot. I enjoyed every bite."}
{"text":"seaweed paper, sushi rice, surimi crab, shrimp tempura, honey habanero, sweet chipotle mayo, cilantro, cucumber, pico de gallo, avocado...

i think i've found the most addictive food item in the entire las vegas valley, and who would've thought it would come in the form of a ridiculously oversized sushi roll? the only thing i can really ask for more is an even bigger sushi roll. when i get done eating, i always feel like want a little bit more, but not enough to buy a whole other one. how long will it take before these guys experiment with deep frying these things too?"}
{"text":"It was ok. The experience was fun. BUTTTT, it really wasn't THAT delicious. I think people are just excited about the hype of it all. It didn't taste any different than something I can get at the grocery store. They just didn't cut the pieces so I can eat it like a burrito is really all I get out of it. My cousin complained about her stomach in knots for about an hour after eating. 

The staff didn't seem that excited to be there either. No recommendations and just a whole lot of awkward silence."}
{"text":"First time here and definitely not my last time. :) 

In my book... Anything that SoHo...uuummm... Chef John starts is fantastic!! The flavors are always on point and the service is always 5 star. 

I could just stop here since the food and the service is always amazing at all three of their locations... This one being their newest location... BUT i won't. :)

When i drove by this place, i was wondering how the business was since the whole area seemed a little dead to me. But i could tell that the business was rocking as soon as i walked in.

I ordered their steak roll... And I added jalapenos and it was delicious!!! Service was dead on as well. The staff was young but totally all over it. 

I like how you can customize it to either get the sea weed paper or the soy paper... Brown rice... White rice or sushi rice.

I also tried their spam and eggs... Delish! I don't know what it is but I have to say that I like them more then Jaburritos down the street.

Chef John is awesome and I'm glad that a local guy can make it. 2 thumbs up! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I are big SOHO fans. We started going to their restaurant on Jones and Warm Spring. This location doesn't disappoint. There are a ton of Sushi Burrito spots that popped up in the last couple years but this one is by far our favorite. Great service and food is consistently good."}
{"text":"Soho sushi has always served the best quality fish in Vegas, compared to ALL these other sushi restaurants and now they've opened a SOHO SUSHI BURRITO!!! You don't understand how happy this makes me (,: the only problem is that this place is pretty far, literally next to palace station and the whole plaza is still being built but once it's built I think it'll do well. I tried the soho bowl, I put veggies, salmon and ahi with some special dressing on top. While my friend got the salmon burrito and both was like an foodgasm in my mouth omg they always use the freshest stuff and the quality is there you can just taste it in their food. Now to talk about how the inside looked; lemme tell you their floors looked so clean you can literally eat off it! There were enough seating, AND their bathroom was wonderfully clean. I completely enjoyed my visit here, and just like the other store they own, the customer service is ALWAYS on point! They never fail to satisfy all their customers. Definitely would recommend and probably going to bring all my friends here!"}
{"text":"food is not bad. But they always close about an hour early which is I really sick with!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Twin dragon burrito is a too hard to eat hand roll with a lot of filler. Had a build your own and it was  tasteless except for the overly hot jalapeño. Service was good."}
{"text":"Before heading to the airport, I stopped by to grab a bite to eat for lunch. Was pleasantly surprised as the sushi burrito was fantastic. I ordered the High Maintenance on a soy wrap. It was filled full of fresh goodness consisting of yellowtail, spicy tuna, red onion, guac, lettuce, cilantro, wonton strips and creamy cilantro sauce. It was so light and refreshing I probably could have eaten two. Taro chips n warm cheese sauce were addictive. I will definitely be back when I'm in town again."}
{"text":"The Sunset bowl was delish! The crew were all inviting and  friendly. Portions are generous and the restaurant is well maintained."}
{"text":"It's delicious. You can choose between burrito, bowl, or nacho. You can make your own or pick from the menu. We tried two off the menu, the Twin Dragon and the High Maintenance. Both were filled super full with ingredients, I'd say you get about two sushi rolls at least worth of rice and food per burrito. I was definitely full with one burrito. Also tried the taro chips, they were nice enough to let us try one of each flavor, I liked them all. Strangely it is served with that bright yellow fake cheese normally found on movie theater nachos, but it works. Also tried the ice cream mochi, the mango was good. I would recommend if for no other reason than the novelty, but I think I would like it even if the rolls were more traditionally arranged. Want to try the nachos next time."}
{"text":"For my first time I love the concept of the restaurant. 
The food is very tasty and great pricing. I will recommend this place if you love sushi. A burrito will get you seriously full."}
{"text":"i was excited to try this new concept only to be sorely disappointed.  i got a bowl with half brown rice and half mixed greens; protein included salmon and spicy tuna topped with assorted veggies.  the salmon was fine but the spicy tuna was horrible - tasteless and not spicy at all.  the brown rice was under cooked and of low quality.  the only saving grace was the habanero sauce; this was pretty good but cannot eat too much of it or it'll burn your tongue off.  

my dinner mate says the burrito was actually pretty good so maybe i should have gone that route.  oh well.  i guess i'll never know."}
{"text":"Had lunch yesterday with a friend. Food was a 5 service was a 4 only due to the fact that we had never been there and they did not really take any time out to explain anything to us. Granted it's all explained on the menu but there's a long line as it was lunch time and I felt rushed to pick. Beyond that we had nothing to do so we sat for a few hours and caught up on general conversation and were not given any issues about leaving. Overall I was satisfied and will be back."}
{"text":"A unique idea that is soooo good. made my own sushi and it was bigger than a Taco Bell burrito.  Hubby got the cheesy asada burrito and said it was great. And definitely will come back the next time we are in Vegas. In the neighborhood go. It had a line the entire time we were there and we got there around 11:25am"}
{"text":"Need to get a quick sushi fix? Look no further this place has everything you need. They have super quality fish with fresh ingredients all rolled up in to a super sized sushi roll. If you need a spicy kick ask for the habonero sauce. Only wish they had more seating."}
{"text":"This place was delicious.

-chicken and rice: 3.5/5. Nothing special about it but simple enough for the kids to eat. The rice was a little on the tough side.

-twin dragon: 5/5, this thing was legit. It definitely hit the spot and was surprisingly filing. Everything in the worked and that extra spice from tuna was delicious.

-3 amigos: 4/5, something was missing. Maybe some soy sauce? Whatever the sauce was in there wasn't enough for me. Be still pretty damn good.

-chips: 5/5, what the hell are those things? Delicious is what they are!

Great past, can't wait to come back to try more."}
{"text":"Wow I am so impressed. To be completely honest, I had super low expectations just because I've heard super mixed reviews about this similar popular place back home (Sushiritto in SF) and I just thought SOHO would be similar. Anyway, ordered 2 Twin Dragons to-go, one with no spicy tuna/sub extra crab, and one with no spicy tuna/sub reg ahi tuna. When I unwrapped it I was thinking in my head that it was going to only be \"okay\".... Damn was I mistaken. Even my boyfriend was surprised over how freakin BOMB it was. We are definitely planning on coming back!!! The twin dragon is a MUST!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great for vegetarians However I felt like I was in a lame night club with the terrible music. Next time I'm taking it to go."}
{"text":"The concept of customized sushi is a game changer. I had a Fire Cracker roll on seaweed paper and it was amazing. Only $5.50 for a large portion of sushi. I plan to go back and try the Twin Dragon. Definitely a must try place."}
{"text":"This place gets 5/5 for originality and flavor. And yes...I know there's other places similar to this, but a) they aren't near my house, and b) I've never been...so this review is strictly based on Sohos. 

But I digress. If you've read other reviewers this place serves sushi burritos-and they are tasty! Think sushi meets burritos meets chipotle. You can create your own burrito or bowl or salad with ingredients such as spicy tuna, yellowtail, steak, chicken, shrimp tempura, guacamole, lettuce, cucumbers, jalapeños, tempura crunch, wonton crisps, and more. If you aren't feeling creative, you can select a burrito from one of their options. Again, it is chipotle style, so you have compete control over what does/does not go into your meal. 

We ordered the twin dragon and the three S's burritos. The three S's had a bit too much sauce, but it was tasty. If ordered again, I would tell them to easy on the sauce. I preferred the twin dragon, which was a little lighter on the sauce and delicious. 

We were there on a Saturday night around 6pm and there was a steady stream of patrons. There's not a lot of seating area in the restaurant, but that didn't seem to be an issue. Many people were taking their order to go. Service was quick and efficient considering the number of people. 

Overall, if you like sushi this place is definitely worth the trip. If there's people in line, don't let that discourage you, it shouldn't take too long. :-)"}
{"text":"SoHo SushiBurrito is what other sushi burrito/bowl places aspire to be. The prices are extremely reasonable! I forget the name of the burrito I ordered (shame on me! I remember it was an all tuna burrito) but after trying my friends' burritos, next time I would order one of their's. One got the firecracker tuna and it had the right amount spice that made it flavorful and a reasonable kick. My other friend got the dynamite burrito (it had crab and shrimp tempura) and I loved the warmth the shrimp tempura provided in contrast to the cold ingredients.  My burrito was nearly falling apart! It was packed with goods. 

If you are going with a large group, don't go during the heart of lunch time. Seating was limited, but we also went on a Saturday afternoon."}
{"text":"Best....Thing....Ever!  I live for Sushi Burrito!  Cannot get enough of it.  We popped in for lunch one day when I was craving SoHo but it was not open yet....Went back for dinner that night.  Something for everyone in the family, so fresh, so delicious....Love it!!!!"}
{"text":"Their burritos are sooooo good! The bowls aren't as tasty imo, but that may just be because my Uber delivery driver sucked and made everything fall over, including our soups. Not Soho's fault though, but damn that Uber driver made me not wanna order from them again. We will most likely dine in here instead of getting delivery."}
{"text":"The first time I was here I got one of their signature burritos and remembered it being really delicious, don't remember much else. 

Last week my co-workers and I came here for lunch and I was hugely disappointed. First, my co-worker asked one of the staff which base is the best with one of the bowls she wanted to try, the guy waved his arms around and said \"it varies...I don't know..\" Not the best way to advertise your food and help your customers. 

My complaint has nothing to do with the quality of the food; veggies were fresh, fish were cold and fresh, great flavors. I just don't think its worth the price. If you have ever been to Too See Roll, I think you will agree that TSR is much better. 

I don't like that this place has limited fish options, the most expensive bowl gives you 2 fishes and anything else is extra. Their toppings are also very limited and don't really fit well with the concept of the bowls: guacamole, sour cream, red onions, pico...seems like toppings at Chipotle more than toppings for sushi bowls. Common toppings such as seaweed salad is also extra. TSR has so many more toppings that are all included and they also allow more variety of fish at around the same price. 

Don't think I will come back here, not that food isn't good, I just like more variety and options with my bowl which this place just does not offer. But if you live far from TSR then this place will just have to do."}
{"text":"What can I say? I'm a fan of this place. Granted it's not on my side of town, but whenever I'm in the area I swing by. 
The burritos are the best. I have Yet to venture into the bowls (but will eventually).
This place is always busy but the staff always keeps up with the flow."}
{"text":"The food here is decent, not as good as the Sushi burrito place on the Linq but it's do-able. However, the service here needs to have some adjustments made. The linemen don't pay attention to the bowls/burritos they're making and seem very unenthusiastic and like they hate their job-- which is not very pleasant to deal with when you're ordering from them..."}
{"text":"For many the concept of a sushi burrito is still new, but if you're curious definitely try it at this place. Compared to jaburrito I prefer this place if I'm in the mood for a sushirito. I like their menu options as they have better tasting options (in my opinion) and the portions seem to be bigger. If you're not in the mood for fish or don't eat raw stuff you can get your GAINZ on and get steak! Like other places you can build your own sushi burrito! Price range is usually $8-$11 per order! You can also get a poke bowl! Like the sushi burrito, they have premade options or you can build your own bowl. Prices for bowls are cheaper as they range from $6.50-$8. The only reason why I didn't rate it a 5 is that the bowls tasted kinda bland to me and lacked a little more flavor. It's not bad if you're looking for something simple. Besides that everything else was good! It's a bit small inside, but it's usually clean and the employees are friendly! They take the time to explain their options."}
{"text":"Made my own sushi burrito with soy paper, sushi rice, yellowtail, crab meat, masago, cilantro aioli, chipotle japanese mayo, cucumber, red onion, tempura YUMMY!!!"}
{"text":"Really good selections and value for money. Hope this place keeps up soho sushi house reputation. Honey habanero sauce is awesome. Looking forward to a restaurant in Henderson"}
{"text":"Great service and food. You can make your own. Options are awesome"}
{"text":"a low review due to the customer service.
I got a twin dragon, it was okay nothing out of the ordinary. The customer service made me not want to go back."}
{"text":"Soho is my isshhh! I love the twin dragon ! Even when it's a set roll you can always have add on's into your roll. Don't get to wild though, it can only hold so much. 3amigos is also bomb ! If your a light eater like me you will get full on half a \"burrito\". Don't expect to be in & out around lunch time, this place moves fast but the demand is high so expect a line."}
{"text":"Went here on a recent trip to vegas, it was by far our favorite spot. Very quick and attentive service. The food was amazing and the prices were very good. Sushi can be expensive but for a bit over $20 me and my fiancé both got a burrito and we're stuffed. At that price we got extra meat and add ons. I got soft she'll crab and tuna with avocado, seaweed salad and masago along with the free toppings. The amount if food we got would have cost over $60 at a traditional sushi spot....probably much more in vegas. We loved it so much we went 2x in 3 days in vegas, our last stop before going to the airport. Seriously if you like sushi take the time to visit this place, it is less than 10 minutes from the strip...you and your stomach will thank me! I will definitely be returning every time I visit Vegas in the future."}
{"text":"Ok Yelpers, 4 stars really? Is it just the idea of it? It sounded kinda good, so we stopped for lunch today.  Plus tons of really good reviews!

I ordered the angey tuna and hubby ordered the twin dragon. 

Twin dragon, he says yummy, liked it, but wouldn't order it again. It was like a super fat suchi roll- its just too much.

Angry tuna, made me sad, it wasn't spicy at all, and the tuna was poorly cut. The chunks were just too big. The bowl itself was full of fresh ingredients and i kinda liked all except the tuna, which should have been the star of the dish.

Sorry, 3 stars for creativity :)"}
{"text":"I got to know this place because they are in uber eats. Their menu is simple but their food is great quality. Now im in the sushi burrito trend madness."}
{"text":"Yes! What a fun funky twist of flavors. I don't eat seafood so it was nice to be able to go out with friends who do and still be able to get a tasty treat. I got the steaks and cheese roll and it was awesome. The staff was super helpful and it is in like a subway style food line so you can modify the order to customize your experience."}
{"text":"Good spot for lunch.  Gets a little busy.

One criticism I have is that they often ring up the wrong items and overcharge.  It's happened to me 3 times where I have to catch the receipt and have been overcharged."}
{"text":"Yep, it's that good. Finally sushi that will satisfy without breaking the bank. Instead of having to buy two or three rolls to fill you up, now it's just one sushi burrito and most are under $10. Super innovative and delish... If you love sushi you need to go. It's super casual, and if you're with friends who don't dig sushi they have regular burritos too. I got the ahi tuna burrito with a seaweed wrap (can't remember the name), and I was in heaven. Everything looked good."}
{"text":"For a quick \"fast food\" type of place, this is restaurant quality food. The same quality taste as Soho Sushi (their restaurant), but I can grab and go in 5 minutes!! The format is like Chipotle, except you have sushi ingredient options. Quick, friendly staff, fresh, and healthy (well that's up to you). My new favorite for a quick, eat on the go type of place. 

I LOVE that I can create my own sushi burrito. They are generous with ingredients and my packed burrito only came out to about $11.00!!!
I got soy paper, sushi rice, Ahi tuna, massago, crab, shrimp tempura, screaming O sauce, avocado, cilantro, red onion and tempura crunchies. A little smaller than a chipotle burrito but perfect for me. Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"This place is ridiculously close to my job, so I've been eating here a lot. They are known for their sushi burritos, but they also have poke bowls, teriyaki bowls and unique sides. The burritos are pretty small though so I usually make my own poke bowl. I find that they are much larger and use more protein than competitors. They use a small scoop, but give you three of those per protein. So if you chose 3 proteins you get 9 scoops! Plus a generous helping of white, brown or sushi rice. That's a lot of food ya'll. 

They have basic sides like edamame and miso soup, but they also have these delicious taro chips that you can get flavored in furikake, cheddar, and sour cream and onion. The chips are tasty and they come with a nacho cheese sauce for dipping. If you add a drink you can get the combo price which saves a few $$$.

This place does charge for extra protein and premium toppings though, but since they are so generous with portions, it's not a deal breaker for me."}
{"text":"Sushirritos are apparently not a new idea, but I have never heard of it before. Sushi and a burrito all in one? I was intrigued. SoHo occupies a small space across from Palace Station, next to David's Bridal. The dining room is small and there are only a few tables. The first time I came here was around dinner time and the dining room was packed. There was nowhere to sit so my friend and I walked to the Mickey Dees and ate there. The last time I came in, around 7pm, there were a few open tables so my friends and I were able to eat there. I wish they had a bigger space so they could have more seating, but they are still new and Rome wasn't built in a day. 

So how it works is you make your own bowl/burrito/salad/nachos, or you can choose one of their signature selections. I have tried a few signature items but I prefer to make my own. I almost always get a burrito on a seaweed wrap with fresh salmon, surimi crab, tempura shrimp, spicy mayo, unagi sauce and masago. This costs about $11 or so. All of the ingredients are fresh and tasty. You can get your items ala carte or upgrade to a combo that includes a drink and a side of your choice for a few bux more. Side options include edamame, miso soup and taro or tortilla chips with nacho cheese. The taro chips were surprisingly sweet, and went really well with the canned nacho cheese. I love sweet/savory combinations and this one was pretty good. Make sure to grab salsa/soy sauce/ginger/wasabi from the salsa bar."}
{"text":"Soho is my new favorite spot in Vegas now. Store is kind of small, the kitchen is visible; you are able to see how they make your sushi burrito.  They applied the same concept like Chipotle. You can create your own burrito, bowl or salad with ingredients that you like; including the rice, fish, vegetable and sauce. If you aren't feeling creative, you could also choose a burrito from one of their signature sushi burritos. They are also providing vegan beef and vegan chicken options for vegetarians. You can completely control over what does go into your burrito. I love it !"}
{"text":"Sushi burritos are delicious. Some days are better than others.  I guess it depends on who's making it I guess.  Only complaint is that it gets crowded a lot and it's hard to find a table to sit at. Especially if you're coming with a party larger than 2."}
{"text":"Okay, I'm not going to lie, I went here at least once a week while I was here on business for a month. LET. ME.TELL.YOU! I thought the idea of sushi+burritos= awesome, and this place never disappointed. 

The first two times that I went, I created my own. The spicy tuna is ACTUALLY SPICY! Not burn you mouth off kind, but a little bit more than a buffalo sauce gives off. Definitely a good mix with the shrimp tempura or fresh salmon :) 

The next two times I went I got the taro chips with cheese sauce and the umami burrito! They were finally offering eel and it quickly became my favorite thing! I will say the price is a bit steep on that roll ($11 something for the roll ) but it by far had some of the best and most kick butt flavors I've ever had.

My concerns going into this place was the same I get with every burrito, it's going to get too big and soggy and just be a ball of mush at the end. I did not run into that problem here. They have a machine that tightens the rolls for them and it certainly helped! It's not overpowering or mushy. just great flavors and fun ambiance. 

When you think about it, you're gonna spend about $15-$20 on 2-3 8pc rolls, without a drink. This place will run you about $8-10 without a drink and fills you up more.

Taro chips were okay, not one thing I need to get again though."}
{"text":"The wife told me she tried one of these sushi burrito spots in town and I decided to take to Yelp to see what the best reviewed place in town for them was before I set out to give one a whirl. 

Stumbled across this spot and I'm glad I did. It was a great first impression!

You can make them more typical burrito like or more sushi like. I leaned towards sushi like because I love sushi. Shrimp tempura, spicy tuna were my proteins of choice. They were not stingy with the protein which is a major plus for me. I got it wrapped in the seaweed with white rice- also typical sushi style. I had some buffalo sauce and lettuce in there which took away from the sushi feel so ill probably lean away from that next time. 

Mine and my wife's together came to about $15. Really can't beat that. I left satisfied and I have a pretty serious appetite. The wife was full until about lunch the day after. I call this a win. 

Definitely go here."}
{"text":"The service was awesome!  I tried the Mochi mango ice cream and it was sooo good!  I loved the interesting textures I. The Santa Fe wrap, sooo warm and tasty! The place was clean and affordable"}
{"text":"Love the concept of the Sushi Burrito! Great quality ingredients - super important especially dealing with fish! I'm not extremely familiar with the different sauces and toppings when it comes to sushi so I went with a burrito that was already set in the menu.. or you can make your own burrito or bowl. It was very busy so I didn't want to bug anyone with questions but I would like to get more info for next time so I can create my own! I will absoutely be back!"}
{"text":"Holy bowly!!! This place has it all! The quality of all the ingredients in my bowl and the wrap (Sunny Salmon) was top notch! Only to be outdone by the smiles and amazing people who put it all together. I have eaten at the original Soho Sushi Burrito off Sahara and thought that was the very best, but they were one upped by their own restaurant! I can't say enough good things about the restaurant and all of the people who work there! I've now been there 3 times since they've been open and all 3 times were 5 star perfection! Thank you for my bowlrrito! Mmmmmm"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the food here! Just seemed like a never ending line for lunch... However the extremely helpful and friendly staff here made up for the wait... I also highly recommend the Twin Dragon and the Angry Tuna! Both huge portions and fresh as can be!"}
{"text":"My go to is the lion king. It is refreshing but today I tried the triple S burrito and I have to say it's my new favorite. Couldn't wait to take a bite. Lol excuse my bites. I like how quick the service is and so yummy! 

If you have the cash try it sometime. 

Some can be too salty for my taste so only five stars. 

You can also get a bowl with spinach if you want to keep a low calorie count."}
{"text":"I built my own burrito. It's like a poke bowl in roll form. I added the Surimi Crab (imitation crab), ahi tuna, and salmon. I'm trying to avoid soy sauce, so I chose Creamy Cilantro and Sweet Chipotle Mayo. I don't know how they taste separately, but topped with sweet ginger at the end - amazing! I also added all the free toppings that went spicy. Don't forget all the crunchy stuff: wonton strips, tempura crunch, and fried garlic, if I'm not mistaken.

Oh, if you haven't been, try the taro chips!"}
{"text":"Sushi Burritos are life!!! I've been there twice a week for the last month and am still in love with this place. YUMMMMM!!"}
{"text":"If you have not tried sushi burrito, this should be your first. If you have, you should have Soho on you go to place with friends. I have used it a couple of times the food handlers are good and 3 Amigos is my fav. :)"}
{"text":"Believe the hype!! Everything you've read about this spot is true - super fresh menu, superb ingredients, ultra fast service too! Awesome spot to get your fix for some raw fish - plus there's a Thrifty Ice Cream next door for all other dating needs. Have not sampled everything on the menu, but I assure you'll never look at a burrito the same! Only thing holding this place back is the size of their dining room... but totally worth the cafeteria style dining! Prices are on point for the portion size as well!"}
{"text":"A must go! I go here often enough- delicious sushi burritos. They even have options if you aren't a fan of raw fish such as the Lion King (even though I love sushi... the Lion King actually is one of my favorites). Very popular place.. I don't think I've ever gone without a long line or at least the majority of the seats already taken. That alone should tell you that this place is a place you should try. Great food!"}
{"text":"Loved loved loved the burrito. I didn't actual think I would be full eating it but I was. The fresh salmon and crab was really surprised. 
The wait really sucks especially if you got stuff to do and unfortunately the staff isn't really knowing what to do which holds up the line."}
{"text":"This place is well worth the visit and wait. It's a casual fast food concept but takes a longer as everyone wants something different. 

Easy to get to -located across the street from Palace Station (OJ's favorite) 

The line is constantly out the door for good reason. 

The food is cheap, fresh and tasty! 

I recommend getting a combo with the chips and cheese sauce with whatever you decide to enjoy. You save 50 cents compared to buying the items separately.

I ended up having the high maintenance as I'm not and wanted to try something others wouldn't. 

It was amazing! 

I recommend this place to others.  Locals and tourists.

They don't take orders over the phone so be prepared to wait.

I enjoyed the compressor machine that presses the burritos together."}
{"text":"If I am craving sushi, but I am in a hurry this is a must. Great selection, and being able to customize is also great. They are always quick even when there are lines."}
{"text":"Tasty food, pleasant service. A bit overwhelming for a first-timer, but I hear it was just as good (I not better) than the Sushiritto restaurant in Cali."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi burrito spot!!! Never disappointed. Flavors are spot on, unlike other places I've been to. My all time favorite is the 3 amigos! The fish is always fresh and they're quick! Thanks SoHo!"}
{"text":"Love love love love love this place! I got the high maintenance burrito. It was so delicious. The fish tasted super fresh and the burrito was so big. I can't wait to come back here and try out more burritos."}
{"text":"All I wanted was an Angry Tuna burrito with spicy tuna. All I got was a overstuffed burrito where everything fell out and apart after one bite.

I really don't know what to say! I mean the service was good, the portion was good, the value is very good. It's just that yes, I expected a burrito but I wasn't expecting it to break apart. The only thing I asked extra for is the spicy tuna and everything that usually includes with it.

I must try it one more time, location is just too far from home or work."}
{"text":"So lately been on the Poke Bowl mission and with the amount of places popping up around Vegas it hard too keep up with the competition. I notice from another yelper (thank you yelp check in feed! lol)) about another Poke Bowl one that really close too my house. The name SOHO immediately thought of the restaurant. I have never been but after coming here just might have go check it out. The same owners also own this place Soho Sushi Burrito. It was while ago but still remember the first time heard of sushi burrito concept was the same guys had location on Sahara. Or not?? In any case the one thing I do know is the Poke Bowl are Da Bomb. The Poke Bowl section of the menu they have five different ones they came up with and also B,Y,O (build your own) section. Teriyaki Bowls. So there really is some Bowl here to please everyone. I went with the Lahaina Bowl. I loved everything about it! I was in spicy tuna kind of mood so figure start my check list off. I really enjoy the way all the ingredients in the bowl complimented each other. The dressing or main sauce the sweet chipotle mayo was solid. The topping most of them are free but just FYI not all of them are free. I just added cucumbers, and corn to my bowl. Really you can create your own master piece with every bowl. The starch you get choose from white or brown rice or even have nice organic mix salad greens for the base. I went with white rice. The fish quality was awesome. REALLY if the fish not fresh then why even call it Poke anything. The truth. Soho Sushi Bowlrrrito freshness is five star no doubt. The portion you get for the price is steal of deal. I know came here for recovery meal after long training session. Hit the spot. Fresh Tuna, Fresh Toppings, and Carbs. Healthy at its best my friends..

The place is small so just might have wait find spot sit down. I came lunch time line but thankfully by the time got up front couple seats open on the counter area soon as you walk in. You can tell the place just open because they have full crew working the line. They literally had six workers building either sushi burritos or bowls. It made the line go by at nice pace so even if busy not going take that long. The best part about the whole concept is both burrito or bowls easy take it home too eat or wherever. Patience will be rewarded.

The sushi burrito am sure is the da bomb. They use the same fish for both. The options for the burritos are the same like the bowls. Lot of great options and really something for everyone. The staff was awesome. Every one along the line was friendly, high energy, and lots of smiles around. No doubt plan on coming back again finish that check out list for Poke Bowl section of the menu..."}
{"text":"When I read the description of this place I knew I had to try it out without even reading the reviews! And wow this place rocks: think of Chipotle with a sushi spin on it. It is exactly what I expected and that means I will definitely be back to try out other fun combinations"}
{"text":"The portions were better than I expected. Let's be honest here, I'm a cheapskate, so I wasn't clammoring to try this place when I first heard it opened bc of the pricing. Yes, it's basically an uncut maki roll, but it's much bigger in diameter. If you were to cut these, you wouldn't be able to fit one piece in your mouth. I don't even know how they roll it with all the stuff they put in it. These guys are pros.

And they have this cool machine that puts the rice on your nori or soy paper on in seconds! 

Your order goes down the line Chipotle-style and the guys assemble your burrito. Like I said, it's a generous amount of fish. We went on their anniversary day to take advantage of the BOGO special and I was also surprised they didn't skimp on the portions on sale day. Even at full price, while still pricey for lunch, is a much better deal (and better tasting) than supermarket sushi. And let's get real here, the sushi at Whole Foods market isn't that great and it's freaking expensive! Dollar for dollar, this place is more worth it. And more filling than I thought!

Authentic Japanese sushi this is not, but those purists with a stick up their ass can go eat somewhere else. This is America and this is American style sushi, and yes it's good. If you want \"real sushi\" made by a \"real Japanese chef\" and pay $50+ for a tiny meal then be my guest. If you're not one of those annoying purists, then come and give this place a try."}
{"text":"Now I know what all the hype is about.  Clearly a sushi burrito grabbed my attention. Why wouldn't it?!!?? 

First off I was confused by the name some since on yelp and other patrons told me it was called something else, but after I cleared up the confusion I finally found it. The place was a little hard to find because of all the construction, but I'm sure it's only temporary. 

The place is like chipotle. You pick burrito, bowl, nachos, etc....then on top you're choice of protein. New thing for me was a vurrito wrapped in seaweed. They do have a wide selection of sushi and sauces that was fun. You get to add your choice of sauce, vegetables and salsas at the end. Interesting to say the least. 

I tried the yellowtail and spicy tuna with the ponzu sauce. The burrito is a tad on the slim side but overall not bad. I am a bit interested in the other sushis they have, so I'll be back. 

Service was par, we did arrive at a busy time so maybe that was a played a factor in it. Nonetheless, really cool concept! Check it out"}
{"text":"I'm not a sushi snob, so this place is perfect to satisfy my occasional cravings. AYCE menus don't interest me and Soho's casual concept allows me to be a picky sushi eater without aggravating a professional sushi chef.

I love how vegan-friendly the menu is here. On my first visit, I selected the Gardein asada as my protein. It was good, but the texture is chewy like meat and I'm not into that. I was very happy to find tofu available on my next trip. I don't like seaweed, so the soy paper wrapper is perfect in place of nori. I also request brown rice and there's no extra charge. See why I'm not welcome at generic sushi bars? They have many sauces available to flavor to your sushi burrito. So far, my favorites are unagi to add sweetness and chipotle mayo, just like I saw at street-side sushi stands in Mexico.

The only thing I miss is my favorite vegetable tempura roll. I would love to see that offered as a special one day. I will mention that my combination of soy paper, brown rice, lots of veggies, and sauces does not create a sturdy burrito. It's very messy with all the ingredients escaping with eat bite. A side of chips comes in handy to scoop up the fallen filler. I tried the taro chips at the recommendation of all social media ever and it worked out well. I'm not a furikake fan, but the sweetness wasn't bad. 

Having cheese sauce available is a nice touch because true Mexican sushi rolls are heavy on the cheese: tres quesos o mas. Also, the prices are very fair, making a Soho SushiBurrito a cheap and fast meal. Sure, you will pay more for seafood, but I appreciate that I'm charged accordingly."}
{"text":"Food is delish!!! The burritos are so filling, packed with good proteins and veggies. I have yet to try a burrito here that I dislike. And they have Mochi ice cream!!"}
{"text":"Really tasty fresh fish.  It was all I thought it would be.  I think I'd like more menu options but I'll def try it again. I had the Angry Tuna and it was very very delicious. I recommend."}
{"text":"Love everything about this place. The staff is friendly and super efficient and the food is just so amazing and fresh. I honestly could eat here or any soho location every day. I wish there was one closer to Summerlin but hopefully soon they will have one. This place is my go to before I run my night time 5k or 10k. The protein and rice are perfect energy for me. Im a customer for life!"}
{"text":"This place is the best! I've been coming here almost everyday for lunch trying each item. Waikiki bowl and North Shore is my favorite. Lahina bowl when I want something with a kick. Cant go wrong with the taro chips or mochi.

Staff is always welcoming. Thanks Rosie and Chalissa"}
{"text":"First visit, just in time because the line was constant coming in!!! 
I got a soy wrapper with shrimp tempura, crab, avocado, cucumber, eel sauce, masago and wonton strips. Very tasty and a good size portion. Definitely not leaving hungry! 
Would come again"}
{"text":"Amazing! Having seen all my SF/Bay Area friends post all these new poke bowl places up there, I was so excited to learn of this place in Vegas so I can enjoy some! However haven't ordered a bowl yet cause I'm still getting through all the sushi burritos. Even better they said they may be opening one near me in the Southwest area! Seriously will be there weekly, so good!!

Fast, friendly and super delicious. It gets pretty crowded so go early. Last time we went and got it to go and I pretty much inhaled it!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. My husband, daughter and my self eat here once a week, and we can't get enough of it. Food is always fresh, and staff is very friendly. One thing I would recommend is to have a a rewards program for repeat customers, like my self. Offer free meals and goodies after an x amount of meals purchased."}
{"text":"This place is so good, it's annoying. I wish there was one in Henderson because I would be there every day. Drove 25mins here and it was well worth it! The line was pretty busy, but the staff was awesome and nice. Love it."}
{"text":"Just tried this for the first time and it was delicious! I definitely recommend the Twin Dragon and Sunny Salmon! For those that are looking for a healthier alternative, there's always an option of switching to brown rice !!! Will definitely come back to this place!"}
{"text":"Very pleased with the freshness and the amount of food you get for the price! There is a great selection of proteins, vegetables and condiments. The BYO burrito is a fun way to create something delicious and satisfying. This place has my stamp of approval!"}
{"text":"Not feeling this place. Cheaper than most sushi/poke bowl spots, but you get what you pay for. No complimentary miso soup or iced teas like the other places, and you will be charged extra for toppings that are typically included at their competitors' joints (e.g. Seaweed salad)

Available sauces are also \"creamier\" than others which is not my style - perhaps popular but just not my bag."}
{"text":"I love this place especially when I'm in the area during lunch time, its a must.  Great concept with fresh ingredients and it is healthy.  My personal favorite is the Triple S."}
{"text":"First time I ate here it was fantastic, great idea to combine Japanese sushi making and a burrito like appearance.  Only problem is the parking and getting her it sucks.  been to several others and even the one on Jones is great but like this place--parking sucks at lunch or dinner time.  Being Hawaiian grown anything different like this is great especially because I'm hambun Japanese."}
{"text":"SOHO SUSHI BURRITO is finally here!!!! 

I was very excited to see that SOHO has opened up their own sushi burrito place. This is the only place like this in Vegas and it is a must try! 

Located on sahara right off the I-15 freeway. Perfect location for anyone staying or working on the strip. It is very easy to find and it is right across the street from the Palace station. When I was there for lunch it did start to get a little busy so if there is a wait, it's worth it trust me! 

When you first walk in, there is a wall with a collection of different articles of Chef John Lee, it was really cool to see his back ground and his journey. He clearly has a passion for food and spoiler you can taste it in the food!! 

The staff is super efficient and fast, so the line will go by fast. I overheard them helping customers with questions as it is a new concept and not everyone understands how to order. When I was ordering they were always generous asking me if it was enough sauce and if I wanted more toppings. 

So if you're new to the concept of sushi burrito, they are like big hand rolls or burritos that you can add sushi ingredients to. To start you can wrap your burrito with either traditional seaweed, soy paper, wheat or flour tortilla. If you don't want a burrito (which is crazy), you can get a rice bowl, salad bowl, or nachos. Also parents I saw they had a kids menu too, and I thought wow how thoughtful. Everything was priced pretty reasonably and it definitely won't break the bank. 

You can opt to create your own as they have tons of selections from proteins, sauces, and to veggies. They also have a menu for house created burritos. The one I chose was the Twin Dragon, which is also a really good roll at the Soho Japanese restaurant. The Twin Dragon burrito includes spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, and crab. Have I sold you yet ? Ok the sauce was chipotle mayo and unagi sauce with guacamole, cucumber, lettuce. At first bite I was in heaven.  The burrito wasn't too big or too small as I was able to finish one and feeling satisfied. The sauces tasted so good and house made. Like the spicy tuna was fresh and you can really taste it in the burrito. I also chose soy paper for my burrito and I think I made the right choice, as for me seaweed might have a slight chewy texture for burritos. I honestly want to try every burrito that they have concocted on their menu, they all looked good. I saw they had one with steak and tamago, looks delicious. My friend got a salad bowl with spicy tuna and crab. She said her salad was excellent and she couldn't stop eating it. The bowl size was perfect for her and she didn't leave hungry. I actually was pretty jealous of how great her bowl looked that I will definitely try that next time.

We saw that they had taro chips on the menu and at first we were going to add that with a combo but we decided we were gonna split an order of soho nachos, because why not they are taro chips. They informed us that  they house make their taro chips so I was all over that. We added spicy tuna, onions, pico de gallo, jalapeños and topped with their super spicy sauce. They were LOVE AT FIRST BITE! Taro chips are better than potato chips way better! And Soho Sushiburrito does them perfectly they seasoned them with furikake, I'm sorry I did not think those would go together but they are life! They do have have the chips as a combo size and they have cheese too yum!! I am very glad we chose to get the bigger portion of nachos because we devoured them. They are the show stopper they were so good I cannot recommend them enough. 

We did however get mochi as a side with drinks. It makes more sense to opt for a combo since they tell you, you save a little money doing that so why not? But mochi seriously?! is there anything they didn't think of. Also they were delicious. 

Thank you Chef John Lee and Soho for bringing this to Vegas, as we definitely need  sushi burritos in our lives."}
{"text":"From the outside I was skeptical, but the food is worth it. Basically a hand roll but a hand roll full of amazingness! Prices are a bit steep and rolls are a little unevenly made but it's still good! One thing I would like to see in the future is the employees evenly dispersing the ingredients in the roll, not just in the middle. Awesome food and awesome staff!"}
{"text":"So these Chipotle style sushi \"poke\" bowl and burrito places are popping up around Vegas like crazy. There must've been like 100 or so similar places around the area that just opened up within the last year. Ok I exaggerated. Well it surely aint the same kind of \"poke\" I've known but I'm kind of use to it since everytime I've ordered poke at any sushi bar in Vegas it's always been in a similar form of some raw seafood and fillers like veggies. I guess I never had real poke until I came to the mainland. FML. Ok I think I'm done. On to the rest of my review.

You see my picture of the Waikiki \"poke\" bowl? Yea it looks pretty plain. It tasted pretty plain too and it wasn't even the cheapest bowl on the menu. Zero or little flavor to whatever it suppose to be. It was some ahi tuna, green onion, red onion, sesame soy, seaweed, and furikake. Added jalapeño and cucumber. Kept those fillers to a minimum. It really needed salt or soy sauce. Customer service was fast but maybe too fast cause when I told the 2nd guy in their assembly line it was my 1st time and what do people usually put on it he shrugged his shoulders as if he couldn't care less and continued on. It didnt get busy until after I sat and already had my food. Yea others pics look good and I was hoping maybe to try it as what they were. So maybe I'm doing it wrong. I'd suggest talking to customers who seem like they know how to order.

On a positive note their taro chips were pretty good. Choice of cheese as a dipping sauce meh. Ahh their little tables, limited seating, and 1st experience probably got me at not returning anytime soon. Take your food to go. Enjoy."}
{"text":"I looooooooove this place so much I seriously have dreams about it! If you're in Vegas...GO! WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR???

Pros:
1. Customizable toppings and sauces, even if you get a signature burrito, or you can always just create your own
2. Everything is fresh and delicious 
3. Staff is super friendly and patient 
4. Mouthgasm
5. Decent prices
6. They have Taro Nachos!!

Cons:
I can't think of any....

The Three Amigos is my fave, add honey habanero and some extra veggies. Nomnomnom"}
{"text":"Fresh and healthy selection. Clean and friendly staff, always order to go food but seem to always be busy during lunch times."}
{"text":"Sooo good. I was sceptical at first, a sushi mexican burrito, what? But let me tell u it is amazing they have vegan options and the amount of fish they serve on each burrito is perfect. The staff are really nice and helpful."}
{"text":"They were a lot stingier here on the toppings compared to the other Soho sushi burrito. However, I still like the food and concept. The honey habanero has a great kick so proceed with caution!!"}
{"text":"Don't let the ongoing construction and wobbling tables fool you. Sushi burritos are perhaps one of my favorite concepts, and this place executes them very well.  

I am a vegetarian and made my own with seaweed and brown rice. The options for toppings were great. I had the chipotle mayo and mango soy sauces which were delicious. The salsa and wasabi/soy sauce/ginger bar was a very nice touch. I would go back in a heartbeat!!"}
{"text":"Awesome sushi burrito. Ordered the signature 3 Amigos, steak & eggs and a byo. 2nd time coming here so glad we tried the burrito this time. Although the bowl was also good, the burritos somehow tasted so much better. They were very generous with the protein, packed everything in a 2\" diameter burrito."}
{"text":"I am a big sushi fan, and I couldn't believe it when my sister shoved a sushi burrito in my face two years ago when I last visited family in Vegas. I cried every day since returning to the Northeast and its barren sushi burrito land.  Okay, not really, but I did have a food list of THINGS I MUST EAT RIGHT AWAY whenever I am back in Vegas, and this sushi burrito is in the top five...alright, top two. (If you must know, number one is reserved for Filipino food for this girl.)

I get the 3 Amigos, and it's just so dang tasty and fresh. I love that I can customize my order and tell them to hold the onions and gimme extra avocado. When I'm in town, we usually order via Yelp and pick up. This week though a friend and I actually decided to stay in and eat at the Badura location. Very well lit and clean location, friendly and fast service, gosh, it's just 5 stars all around. I rarely give 5 stars, but this place deserves it. Awesome food, awesome people, awesome place.  I just ate here an hour ago, and I'm already missing it and planning my next visit around this food item."}
{"text":"A must try!!!
Such a great concept!!! 
First visit. Going to come back tomorrow and try another one. I had the twin dragon burrito with a soy paper in place of the seaweed. 
Such a great deal. 12 bucks for a huge helping of your favorite sushi ingredients!! 
My girlfriend had a custom one made with only the things she liked and nothing else. 
So if you don't like what's on the menu tell them what you want in it and they'll do it with a smile. 
There is a little bit of a line all the time but I promise worth the wait.  Two Thumbs up from me!!"}
{"text":"Just go......
Very helpful with menu, gracious portion, great taste, fresh fish, giant sushi roll. What more can you ask for!! Was excited about going and very glad we did! Even had wasabi, ginger and soy station to complete your sushi craving. Come hungry and you won't be displeased. We had the Twin Dragon and the 3 Amigos, two of the menu favorites and they hold up to the hype"}
{"text":"Triple S, bomb. 3 Amigos, bomb. Taro chips, fresh.

The menu's reasonably priced & I like how you can customize the burrito/bowl. The last time I came here (like 2 weeks ago), I noticed signs about online ordering so I have yet to try that out & see how efficient it is.

1 star deducted bc of the checkout experiences I've had every time I stop by. I always verify which burritos I've ordered before I swipe, but whenever they've put the order in the bag they always forget at least 1 burrito that I paid for. Then when I tell them that they missed one, they make it seem like it screws up the whole line. There's minimal communication between the line & cashier so hopefully it's better the next time I visit."}
{"text":"Ok so this place is cute, hidden and the service is wonderful! 
Buuuuuuuuuuuut geezuz it was so hard for me to enjoy my meal because they had these crazy fast fans blowing all over the place and it was blowing my baby hairs into my eyes and tickling my nose! After every bite I was scratching and swiping my fave from the irritation. And I don't know if those fans were blowing around dust but my allergies were wild inside there! Stepping out into the heat was actually relieving! 
Would've gave this place 5 stars if I could enjoy my meal comfortably....possibly putting some tables outside???
Oh and I had the Waikiki burrito style and added seaweed salad (for an additional charge) and it was very tasty and yummy!"}
{"text":"This is our second visit in three days. Incredibly good food. Fresh and tasty. Hope they open up more shops soon cause it takes us 20 minutes to get here, but it's well worth the trip."}
{"text":"BOMB.COM  so delcious, so many options.  I would come here everyday if I could.  Its all so fresh and interesting.  I love burritos and I love sushi, sushi burrito is GENIOUS!  Recommend for anyone who loves sushi.  They have choices of tortilla, soy paper, and seaweed.  I recommend the soy paper.  cause its soft and delcious.  They have meat options to which is why they have torilla option!  My favorite burritos is anything is spicy tuna :)"}
{"text":"Great fast food! 
It's usually pretty fast unless the people in front of you are just clueless and hold up the line. 
Great place for a sushi craving but not wanting to go the AYCE route! Def a lunch spot fav of mine! 
The employees don't ask you if you want to make your meal a combo for a little bit more so make sure you ask!!!!! Otherwise they will charge you more. 
Food is fresh and deeeelish!"}
{"text":"I was here for the BOGO sale a few days ago. It was my first time here and I was in a little bit of a rush, thankfully the line wasn't too long. The workers were friendly and welcomed me when I came in despite the semi-busy setting. I got the \"Twin Dragon\" and the \"Triple S\" rolls to go because I'm a HUGE fan of shrimp and soft shell crab. Honestly, I don't remember the other ingredients in the rolls, but I know it went well together! I really enjoyed the food, but midway through one of the half rolls, the seaweed broke and everything fell apart. I thought maybe it was just this one and the others would be fine, but it happened to the other 3 halves as well. It wasn't a big deal because the food was still delicious! Maybe it was just today because of the rush, but hopefully that's something that'll be fixed the next time I come in!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and customer service. They offer gluten free and vegan sauces. I'm doing Whole 30 and was able to create a salad bowl that was compliant, delicious, and fresh."}
{"text":"First time eating here and got the High Maintenence which come with 3 scoop of yellowtail, 3 scoop of spicy tuna,guac,crispy wonton,and other condiments. The owner is Chef John Lee who also has another sushi restaurant SOHO. All I can say is both of his restaurant is very great. That right not very good but very Great!  Will be back to try other sushi burrito."}
{"text":"Was just in there for my regular burrito and you old lady help back on my protein like it was gold. I recommend if you go there don't let the old lady make your burrito it's horrible so I love Soho sushi burrito"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and it was amazingly delicious. I had the unagi special burrito with seaweed paper. The staff was very friendly and helpful, allowing me to try a couple sauces before deciding which ones to use on my burrito. My only complaint was that there were large inedible bones in the unagi. I'm used to soft, edible bones when I order unagi, but these ones could really hurt someone's throat."}
{"text":"We love this place.  We got there at noon on a Thursday and there was a very long line. So be prepared to wait. The restaurant is very small with very limited seating 

We ordered the Twin Dragon and the 3 Amigos. They were delicious and fresh. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The tastiest sushi burrito in town. I get the Fire Cracker and add salmon to it. It's so affordable and so amazingly tasty. Better than AYCE sometimes.

There are some incredible burritos and a few that were hard to keep together and created quite the puddle. Which was just a bit too much sauce for me."}
{"text":"Like so many people I'd bet you never even heard of a sushi burrito and had trouble with the concept.  But I went with my girlfriend who promised me I would love it.  I love sushi and burritos so what could go wrong?  NOTHING!
 While she ordered a design it yourself burrito, I went with one of the predesigned one.  Just watching them make them was interesting with two machines, one seems to prepare the wrapper and the other once completed tightens up the roll.  I loved the crunch from the wonton strips and the sauces and combination was excellent and I brought some home for lunch the next day and it was still good.
Service was friendly and quick, the place seemed clean but the only issue I had was the ding area seemed cheaply designed and the chairs were uncomfortable.  But I didn't go to sit and relax but to order a delicious and unique food.  I was not disappointed."}
{"text":"Customer service great, satisfying food and all ingredients present for a perfect sushi burrito!"}
{"text":"I'm officially addicted. I've tried doing my own custom order and I've tried the 3amigo, I'm a big fan of custom ordering. My favorite combination is soy paper burrito with ahi tuna, yellowtail, chipotle mayo, green onion, cucumber, and seaweed salad. Give it a go, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Quick and cheap! The food is great, place is clean. We went when it just had opened and already was busy. Will go again!"}
{"text":"This was seriously the best poke place I've been too. You get to choose as money topping as you want and they really give you a good amount of everything. Every bite is full of flavor. The staff here is really nice and helpful. It was my first time going there and they walked me through the process. I will definitely be returning"}
{"text":"Didn't think it was all that good. I've had much better sushi-ritos on the West Coast."}
{"text":"It's literally down the street from my work so it's a go to during lunch! Love the Twin Dragon roll."}
{"text":"Gotta admit - when I first heard of a sushi burrito I was confused. I love sushi and I love burritos, but the two of them put together just made me feel uncomfortable LOL. Regardless, my girlfriend has been wanting to try one and so we came here for her birthday lunch. It was so good that I was craving another one the next day. When we got there the place was pretty packed - we were lucky to find a table. My girlfriend got the special on rice paper, I got the Fire Cracker on seaweed, along with two beers each (happy hour all day - beers only $3!). I recommend this place to anyone that likes sushi (read: all of mankind)."}
{"text":"Awesome food love sushi. Wanted to try something new we ordered online our food was ready on time. The food was absolutely delicious... customer service not so much I wish I could give them 5 star but I got horrible customer service over asking a question about sauce.. definitely need to work on people skills..."}
{"text":"New spot in the neighborhood, had to check it out. It's just like the other place on Sahara but with but with a cute bowl on the logo.  The food was great as usual. I had the unagi special. I'm glad soho offers unagi as one of their proteins. The staff was friendly just like the other spot. Erica with a C was kind enough to check up on us. She made my burrito with care and with me in mind. Thank you! My only negative feedback is that it's kinda warm in the store."}
{"text":"Typical LV dining... way to expensive and not enough to eat....   Actually I don't think I will every go back to LV...."}
{"text":"I would give this place more stars if I could!

Not sure if this place has any affiliation to the Soho Sushi Burrito place located on Sahara and I-15 but their stuff is just as delicious. 

Ordered a custom burrito consisting of soy paper, white rice, salmon, shrimp tempura, surimi crab, cream cheese (costed extra), masago (costed extra), cucumber, green onions, wonton crunch topped off with the delicious sweet chipotle mayo and unagi sauce.*If you're not sure of what to order, you can never go wrong with making your own!

AND you have, have, have to get their furikake taro chips to compliment your meal. Its to die for, trust me on that!

As for service, the staff immediately greeted me and my friends when we walked in, suggested we took our time choosing what we wanted and then after a while gave us some suggestions based on what we said we liked. Their portions are extremely generous too! They could barely roll my burrito after ordering a whole bunch of toppings."}
{"text":"Love coming here for lunch from work! Employees are always nice and the food is great. Only thing that was missing was a good group ordering system for online orders for the office."}
{"text":"YAAASSSS!!!!!!!!! Sushi lovers must try this place. 

I got the firecracker for my first sushi burrito ever and I AM HOOKED. It has a nice kick to it. I typically add lots of wasabi and some soy sauce to my sushi but these burritos are flavored so perfectly I didn't need to add a thing. IMPRESSIVE. 

The ingredients are fresh and and even though it's busy they get things done quick!!!! The price is decent for how big these bad boys are as well.

I ordered the miso soup and it came from a machine and kind of freaked me out lol I wasn't a fan but it wasn't horrible either. 

I AM DEFINITELY COMING BACK."}
{"text":"Soho sushi burrito was my first encounter with the sushi burrito concept! Let's just say I am hooked. The first time I ate there I had the thing dragon and the second time I ate the triple S. I loved both the burritos. So flavorful and any sushi lover or foodie should try it at least once. My only complaint is that they are messy!! It's almost too much food and sauce to eat properly."}
{"text":"If I was to make one recommendation it would be to NOT customize your own sushiritto. Stick with the ones on the menu! The one you make will not be as tasty and delicious as the preset ones on the menu. Choose the type of protein you prefer and look through the other items that come along with the option you chose. You have the option to tell them to leave out certain items and add certain items. It works similar to Chipotle, but with raw fish and Japanese/Mexican additions. Very new idea that has become extremely popular amongst the students at UNLV because it is fun and mainly because of its proximity to the school. It is kind of difficult to find as it blends in with all the local shops amidst the construction in the lot. Just look for the sign that reads SoHo. I would say give it a try if you've never tried it before. While you're at it, grab a side of taro chips. They are quite tasty :9"}
{"text":"Oh my god!! The lion king is ridiculous!! I'm going there all the time now!! I hate mango sauce, but the mango sauce on the lion King isn't a mango sauce. It's more like a teriyaki glaze, and it's got a sweet taste to it. I like sushi, and the lion King is a good starting burrito if you're just trying out for the first time. I honestly believe that this is my first experience at its best ever having any kind of sushi burritos. To the team who's working there, thank you so much because my experience was absolutely amazing and I'm going to recommend it to all my friends."}
{"text":"I ordered a twin dragon.  Fish was fresh.  I enjoyed my burrito.  Employees were nice and kept the line moving.  I had a good experience but not much set it apart from other sushi burrito spots in town.  I guess that's what happens when there are so many similar places especially in this area."}
{"text":"I came to Soho as a recommendation from a friend who lives in Las Vegas. This was by far one of the most impressive versions of sushi that I've ever had. I went simple with a Build Your Own Spicy Tuna burrito and loved ever bite of it. They did not skimp on the fish and I added green onion, wasabi aioli, and kimchi aioli...it was fantastic. I will definitely revisit this location the next time I visit."}
{"text":"I like the concept of being able to build your own sushiritto. Realistically, its just a large sushi roll, but the ingredients are fresh and the prices are reasonable as well. It's definitely a good place to grab a quick bite and go."}
{"text":"I know this place has a long ass line. But really how do you get away with calling a fat sushi roll a burrito. I was expecting a corn tortilla or flour one. But whatever. 
The fish and the quality of the ingredients seemed really high and fresh. No fishy smell at all
My friend and I ordered the 
1) Double dragon
2) 3 Amigos
We took the recommendation and didn't customize. 
Also the taro chips- I know they were recommended but all they really are taro chips with furikake (Japenese topping for rice- nori,salt, sugar, sesame seeds). 

The only thing that makes this place even closely Spanish/Mexican is the fact that they make their rolls looks like burritos (soy vs nori) and they serve nacho cheese with the taro chips (totally unnecessary) 

One of the best parts is the unlimited side bar filled with soy sauce, pickled ginger, jalapenos, wasabi. 

The \"burritos\" are quite large but mostly rice. Wasn't too impressed. 

But but but they have everyday 4$ Sapporo, all day everyday!"}
{"text":"Sooo good. They offer many different sushi burritos with many different themes and ingredients. They prices are reasonable and the customer service is really good, and it's kinda fun to watch them roll the burritos. even though there is a long line, it never takes look to get your meal. They also offer many good side option and drinks that many places do not offer. The atmosphere is really cool and I love there wall of the Chinese lucky cats. This place is and and the atmosphere is cool."}
{"text":"This is the same Soho Sushi Burrito located on Sahara and LV Blvd. Same menu, same layout, same concept. I like this location better because it's off the strip so you don't have to deal with tourist or Strip traffic.

I always order the Firecracker on seaweed with brown rice. This is basically a spicy tuna roll in burrito form! Yum!!!! We also like to switch off between the Cajun Tuna or Triple S. Very delicious and  you can completely customize everything to your liking. 

This location is conveniently located off the 215 freeway and Jones Blvd. Once you exit the fwy, there's a small, quaint plaza that will be on your left hand side. Soho is in there. There's a hair lounge, nail salon and a dr office in there also."}
{"text":"Yes yes yes! I'll be back here again for more. If it was at stateline I would make the journey across the desert for this delicious sushi hybrid goodness.

Twin Dragon, its a Tiger roll built like a burrito- Shrimp Tempura, Spicy Tuna and rice/crab wrapped inside your choice of wrap. Also tasted the Lion King, Salmon burrito, which was phenomenal. Taro Chip nachos are a perfect companion for your main dishes.

Ordering follows the usual burrito/bowl/salad formula and is fast and easy. The staff seemed to be enjoying themselves which always adds to an already terrific culinary adventure. Return visits abound in the near future!"}
{"text":"This is was the 1st time eating here. The food was amazing. I didn't think I was going to like it that it would be too much food. But it was the perfect amount for lunch."}
{"text":"We were tired of strip foods, so we started looking outside strip and found this place. Came in right when they opened and there were only a few people inside, but it gets busy pretty fast. We ordered:
- 3amigos(good!)
- jalapeno sour cream taro chips(very salty!)
- original taro chips(very good!)
- build your own(seaweed paper, salmon, yellowtail, crab, masago, mango soy sauce, wonton strips - really good!!)
- angry tuna(good!)

I wish sushiritto in CA will do a build your own like here!! We'll definitely come back when we're in town!"}
{"text":"Heard about this sushi burrito place here in Las Vegas and had to try them out. This place is clean and the employees are friendly and helpful. My husband tried their Twin Dragon burrito- which they recommended, and I made my own burrito with soy wrapper. All the ingredients were fresh and delicious. Our kids loved the rice bowls with tempura shrimp. We'll definitely come back to Soho Sushi Burrito when we're in the area again."}
{"text":"Love this placeeee the taro chips are the best alongside with your massive sushi burrito"}
{"text":"Seriously, whoever created this concept is a GENIUS!  Who would've thunk!

Twin Dragon all the way!  I liked that the shrimp tempura in it was not soggy at all and everything in it tasted very fresh. Customer service was A++! Very nice, friendly, and helpful. 

I admit, the price runs on the higher side, but I think it's completely worth it! Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Delicious. I had the Triple S with seaweed. Amazing. Bonus is they have vegan options as well so my friend and I were able to eat together."}
{"text":"I really like the idea of sushi bowls/sushi burritos but dannnnnng this place gave me the runs . But who knows if it came from this place lol.

Anyway, I made my own bowl, equipped with spicy ahi, yellowtail and shrimp tempura. I think it's best to get half rice and half salad. Keep in mind that you can get whatever toppings as long as it isn't the \"extra .50\" tab. Things like crab, masago and avocado was extra .50.

This place does give a lot of fish! Like 5 scoops of spicy ahi. Gotta admit the yellowtail was a bit fishy. 

I think the chipotle mayo was what messed my stomach up. Try as many dressings as you like before they smother it on your bowl!"}
{"text":"I'm sure you may already be aware but Soho SushiBurrito is identical to Jaburritos. Same menu (just different names), same location, same layout, and it seems like the prices are pretty much the same.

I always get the Firecraker (aka previous name: Rosarito) and my boyfriend gets the Triple S (aka previous name: Rockport). I know that is one of their more popular burritos. We also got the taro chips with nacho cheese. The cheese is whatevers. Like what Stefany V said, it's nothing but 7-eleven/stadium nacho cheese. It used to come in a bigger container. Now it's given to us in a small measly condiment cup. The taro chips are pretty good....very good seasoning...heard it's Furikake seasoning? The burritos CAN be a little bit expensive with an average price of $10 per order. BUT....that usually how much an a la carte sushi order is sooooo..... *shrugs* to each their own I guess.

I really wish they can do something about the seating. It can be difficult to snag a table especially if you come during prime time lunch/dinner hours. I was there when there was a party of 6+ and almost half of the tables/seats were taken. I lucked out getting a table because a couple was just leaving. If not, I would've had to sit on the floor to eat. =/ Hopefully when the weather warms up, outside seating can be an option."}
{"text":"The Food is amazing here, I would Deff Recommend this place! Been coming since they Opened !

question? Where can I buy Those Mochies at? lol"}
{"text":"The first time I came in, this place was called Jaburrito, and the service was horribly slow. I waited 50 minutes in line for my sushi burrito. However, in their defense, they had just recently opened for business and you could tell that the staff making the burritos were very unsure of what they were doing, and not trained well. I came back a few weeks ago, to give this place another chance. Boy were things amazingly different! I ordered and received my burrito in about 5-7 minutes! The staff seemed much more organized and the employees looked more confident in what they were doing. Burritos were delicious! Will be back! Good job Soho!"}
{"text":"Third time finding bones in my salmon. 

Quality control guys! 

But the food is still good!!!....... just a little off putting when you find the bones. 


I'll definitely be returning. Great service! Great staff!"}
{"text":"Any time you walk into a spot and the line doesn't stop the entire time you are in the restaurant they must be doing something right!!! I hate the fact that the entire shopping center is under construction right now, but this does not take away from how awesome SOHO is. I expected this place to be amazing simply because the mother restaurant has never disappointed , and neither did the sushi burrito! With multiple designed burritos and the option to build your own this place has unlimited potential. They even have something for the non fish lover... very well done SOHO!"}
{"text":"Chef John Chien Lee has done it again... His restaurant \"Soho Sushi\" is right by where I live and quickly became my (and everyone's) favorite.  I was very skeptical of his new concept on Sahara.  I've eaten there twice now and it is just amazing.  The quality and quantity of ingredients is amazing.  Its like creating the sushi roll of your dreams but so filling.  Limitless options to try and create your own favorite."}
{"text":"This. Place. Is. Great. Fresh ingredients, great recommendations, amazing customer service! We loved it!!!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Triple S Burrito and taro chips. The Triple S Burrito tastes like a sushi roll crunch. I ordered taro chips with cheese sauce and was mind blown."}
{"text":"Holy bleeping beep!!!! This. Is. Sushi. Spot. Of The Month, If not the whole year! I found Sushi Burrito through Yelp and knew that I could not go wrong for this choice of lunch. I arrived around 2 and the restaurant was not busy, just a few customers. One of the employees offered to explain the menu since it was my very first time which I was appreciative of because he really broke it down to an easy understanding. I ordered the Twin Dragon with chips and Japanese Millen soda. The whole meal just blew me away. The flavor was intense extremely fresh fish the chips you can tell were home made and taste like they are made with natural ingredients. The melon soda I read on the back is made with evaporated milk and it is so unique and fresh I can see myself buying a case if I ever found it in stores. I ended up going back a second time and bring a friend with me. This second time  I ordered the Triple-S  it was very good but I prefer the Twin Dragon instead .  I plan to try all of the sushi burritos that they have to offer . I do not discriminate ;) She agreed that Sushi Burrito needs a Golden Globe award or something of the sort. The atmosphere is great and I was very pleased to find an outlet near table so I was able to charge my phone that was on 3%. That was my hero. Their work stations always look clean and organized so I have great confidence to eat there over and over again.
 Do I recommend this restaurant hell yeah I do and I plan to be back very very soon."}
{"text":"So bomb every single time, this place is good for a quick dinner  or lunch date especially if you both enjoy sushi! The atmosphere is amazing and the customer service is great!!"}
{"text":"I. Am. Obsessed. I don't particularly like sushi and can be super picky when it comes to food but soho blew me away!!! Everything is so fresh and full of flavor. The employees are all so patient and helpful!! I felt overwhelmed when I started to order and every time I've gone they have given me great recommendations. Super accessible location and very affordable!"}
{"text":"Still find the name weird but who would have thought such a combo works.  Since being introduced to this place, I have been 4 times and have gotten others hooked!  Three amigos burrito all the way"}
{"text":"Ordered a sushi bowl and found this little creature. Horrible. I feel sick to my stomach."}
{"text":"I'm knocking this down a star. It is not because the food has gotten worse...it is still insanely good! However, the slow service has only gotten slower with mobile ordering and Uber Eats. They need to make sure they serve their customers in the store as well..."}
{"text":"best thing to come to vegas!!..it's a 20 minute drive from my house but I don't mind..fast, friendly staff and really amazing food."}
{"text":"This place is so delicious. It hasn't changed. However the portions are so much smaller now. You can definitely tell the difference from before when they first opened to changing it now. Disappointing in that . Send great quality. About an entire 3rd smaller. I have my other soho pictures and they are definitely bigger. I could never finish one whole burrito. I'd always have to half it. Today I ate the entire thing. Sad sad that a family owned business like this even cuts their portions in half like this after doing sooo well. It's annoying and sickening quite frankly"}
{"text":"Delcious place highly recommended. Good music . Kids friendly .has alcohol too.. best sushi burrito place  in town! Love this place. And it's fast food . On uber eats"}
{"text":"When two of my favorite cuisines fuse into a cult following type restaurant, I have to give it five stars. 

It's a tiny place that right now may be a little hard to find because of the construction going on in the plaza, but it's definitely worth it. It's next to the shoe place if that makes it easier. 

The best way I can describe Soho SushiBurrito is a mix of Cafe Rio and Chipotle... except with Japanese ingredients. Doesn't make sense? Well basically all the ingredients are laid out for you to choose (or you can choose an item from the menu) and it's rolled into a burrito. So think sushi rolled into a big burrito a la Chipotle style. 

The most pleasant surprise for me was the Taro chips. You can choose from traditional or furikake flavored and it even comes with yellow nacho cheese sauce. I tried the Furikake with the cheese (like nachos) and it was an interesting mix of flavors. Not bad, just interesting. 

I like the place and highly recommend it because I'm a sushi lover... And this place makes eating sushi convenient and neat. The sizes are filling and you can get as creative as you like with the ingredients. Take note though, it gets busy. We were there ten minutes before they opened and there was already a line of six people before us. 

I love the concept, a definite must-try."}
{"text":"I found this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try :) 

It was an interesting concept and very different"}
{"text":"Fast food meet sushi. 3 Amigos 
I'd just returned to the hotel after having viewed \"The Founder\" (the movie about Ray Croc, McDonalds founder) so naturally I had a taste for a Quarter Pounder.  As I cross the parking lot I can't help but notice SOHO sushi . I check Yelp quickly and see the great reviews. Now as much as i had hamburger hunger sushi is my favorite and i was suitably impressed ;Fresh fish, interesting preparation and great value. 
I'll be back for sure"}
{"text":"Okay, first time here - the staff was friendly and explained things well.  ...the choices can be overwhelming.  I went with 2 Long Beach to start out.  Someone told me the portion sizes were a little small - they were wrong and I'm going to end up with way too much food!  The food is fresh and tasty!  Will definitely need to repeat to try more on the menu!"}
{"text":"Located just down the street from its sister restaurant, Soho Japanese Restaurant, this sushi burrito spot is one of many in the area. You can build your own bowl or choose one of their signature bowls. I opted for the Waikiki ($8.50) made with ahi tuna, red onion, green onion, furikake, seaweed and sesame soy. It was decent overall. The fish quality was ok, not exceptional, just ok. The sushi rice was mild, thick and clumpy. The sauces were good, with hints of sweetness and spice."}
{"text":"Ok, so before everyone gets all judgmental on me for not giving them a dashing 5 star rating, my custom burrito was actually delicious. I got a seaweed paper burrito with soft shell crab, spicy tuna, green onion, cucumbers, seaweed salad, fresh jalapeños, crispy wonton pieces and screaming O sauce. Everything tasted fresh and I loved the combination of textures in the burrito. The employees were friendly and smiling. And there wasn't a super long line when we dined in on a Friday night. My gripe is, if I'm going to drop $15 on a meal just for MYSELF, I better be full afterwards. I could have easily eaten another burrito, but I wasn't going to spend another $10 for another one. I went home just to eat again. And the taro chips that everyone is raving about? Yeah, not fond of those or the furikake seasoning that was on them. Glad to say I tried it, but I'll just go to AYCE sushi and be satisfied."}
{"text":"Bomb sushi burritos! My husband and I wait to eat every time we go threw Las Vegas to get there sushi burritos! Clean facility. Friendly staff.. a little pricey but totally worth it! Mmmm! Mmmm! Mmmmmm!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a must do ! Try the Triple S . I will be back at least once a week for lunch for a long time to come"}
{"text":"This is my first time here, and I must say I'll definitely will be back.  I was greeted by staff when I walked in. The staff took the time to explain the whole process of ordering, changing the order, or creating my own bowl/burrito. He was very courteous and funny. The prices were reasonable. The atmosphere was nice and a great place to chill at. I ordered the twin dragon burrito which is spicy, huge and very delicious!"}
{"text":"Build your own Poke burritos! This place is sooo busy! And the food quality backs it up. My go to here is the baked Toro Chips with the nacho cheese. You definitely won't find that anywhere and I suggest that as a MUST try! So addicting! The taco chips are sweet and salty at the same time."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place ! Such a great idea. Sushi burritos may be my new addiction. They just recently opened a location at UNLV so im so excited! My only flaw with this place is the spicy tuna was extremely salty. Other than that everything was so fresh and delicious.  If you like sushi then you will LOVE this place."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time from the first week it opened to march. I stopped going for awhile and I just recently got something today. The customer service is going downhill. The girl who was in charge of starting a bowl/burrito was so rude. None of the staff looked happy at all. The tuna was very good. Yellowtail tasted a bit old, but I haven't got any stomach pains yet. I just feel like this place isn't somewhere I want to go to again. 
Other sushi burritos are opening up in Vegas, so Soho should really try stepping up their game."}
{"text":"This place has by far the best concept; sushi and burrito. Which I tend to love both of them. Every time I come here and I try different sushi burritos, I am not disappointed. They always leave me wanting more. Everything is flavorful and delicious. And what helps is that the staff is also very friendly and helpful. I always seem to walk in happy and leave happier than I came in! I will be visiting today for my occasional lunch pick up for myself and so coworkers of mine."}
{"text":"Fast friendly service.  Long lines (so popular!).  Fresh ingrediants.  Small dinning room.  Delicious food!  My favorite lunch spot!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Great food. Spicy tuna was done perfect. Tip: dont forget ask to add furikake on your rice. Its free. Great prices $5.50-$9 each, so good. Big portions. Has a fresh ginger, wasabi, soy sauce bar. Staff were so friendly and fast. Clean bathroom. The only big complaint I have is that this place is too small, always having to rush to get a table and rushing to eat so others can. Plus, people lining up around you while you eat is horrible and not sanitary (woman sneezed next to me without covering herself and I wanted to punch her). It just ruins the moment of enjoying good food. A tip to the restaurant, get a bigger place, arrange your lining area and dont raise prices... You will stay successful if you do this. Trust me. Lol"}
{"text":"Formerly known as Jaburrito, this place has a different name but still has the same great taste. The menu is the same as Jaburrito but the names of the rolls have changed. I got the Twin Dragon (Long Beach for you Jaburrito fans). Great flavor with a little kick of spice in it. The only problem with this place is there is limited seating so to beat the lunch rush, get there by 11:30. Overall, great place and great food! One of my favorite lunch places!"}
{"text":"tldr

The concept has gotten people flocking to the location resulting in long lines and no seats.

The food itself is bomb though. Get this to go.

Get:
-twin dragon sushi burrito"}
{"text":"Yes, i'm a fan of this place! They fulfill my cravings for sushi during the weekend and at half the price.  To explain it: its a HUGE roll that you can eat like a burrito.  I'm not trying to take anything away from it but thats what it is... and i must say that it is very good!  So good i try to make it there once a week.  Only draw back is if you get there around noon be prepared to take it to go VERY LIMITED SEATING.  See for yourself... you might like it!!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Vegas to grab a quick lunch. This location is close to the strip, easier to get to for people visiting town. They also deliver as well through Uber Eat.

I've been here quite a few times. I always get a customized sushi burrito with soy paper. They have a lot of selections to add in. From hot food to cuts of fresh fish. Think of this place like Chipotle. Basically you go down the line selecting what you want I your burrito or bowl. You can add as much as you want. There are some items that have an up charge.

If you get a burrito with soy or seaweed make sure you eat it soon. It can get soggy after a while. Though I never had a problem with the wrapper ripping. Everything seems to stay together."}
{"text":"Finally checked this out. Staff was super friendly, knowledgeable, and quick. Great service. The Twin Dragon was really really good!"}
{"text":"This place gets pretty busy but, usually the wait isn't long. Great service in here too."}
{"text":"Yes, go to Soho SushiBurrito now, before the line gets too long!! My fiancee and I went for lunch and the line was out the door at 12pm. I got the \"angry tuna\" sushiburrito and realized upon eating it why they call it \"angry.\" It is SO SPICY!! I can definitely handle spicy foods and often ask for it to be made spicy, but this was probably the spiciest thing I have ever eaten. Eaters beware. Aside from that (and the realization that it is nothing more than a gigantic sushi roll, cut into 2 large halves instead of 8 pieces), it was amazing. For the price, it is worth it!"}
{"text":"Cool new concept!!! Quick snd easy to eat sushi rolls...or rather sushi burritos! Can you believe??? 
Was awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. Ordered it on uber eats and it was absolutely delicious. I am definitely going to recommend it to my friends and family that come and live in Vegas because it is a must go to place. I will be back again. Loved this place. Thanks for serving up some great food."}
{"text":"The best thing since sliced sushi! Amazingly friendly staff, clean, and delicious sushi burritos. This is my new spot. I will definitely be back! Thank you for an amazing first time experience Soho!"}
{"text":"I tried the Sunny Salmon with Soy Paper and added shrimp tempura with the recommendation of another yelper. .it was perfect for me! I will definitely order it again.. I still have to try the taro chips next time too.."}
{"text":"Mind blowing best sushi hands down I've ever had. Get off the strip, this is the best money you will ever spend in Vegas. Dynamite roll was insane!!"}
{"text":"I got food poisoning from this place.  Spent a week in Las Vegas glued to the toilet and some immodium in my pocket everywhere we went.  Our first night started on a Sunday and we came here to eat.  Everything looked fresh and tasted good, but that same night when we got back to our hotel I pretty much spent more time on the toilet than the bed.  This happened until Thursday night.  This was our first time visiting this restaurant and I ordered a High Maintenance.  Everything looked good and tasted good but I won't try this place again.  My wife had a totally different burrito, so she was fine.  The line was not bad and we even found a place to sit."}
{"text":"The food is very good and very good combinations a little pricey only 2-stars because they don't include napkins with to go order so I see that as a sign of being cheap and maybe in a little financial troubles!!! Service after the sale counts! Come on guys pay attention to the little things!"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service provided tonight by employee name serge greeted me when i entered service with a smile informed me of new items available and made my triple s PERFECT  I will definitely be frequenting this particular location as long as they have employees like this!!!"}
{"text":"For the price, good quality poke with fast service and they don't skimp on the protein either. Off the strip, but worth the drive. Better deal than what you'd get on the strip. In a strip mall and everything is made in front of you. Bowls are nicely mixed with emphasis on taste than presentation. 

They charge for extra protein, but i don't think this will be a problem because they are very generous with their portions anyways. Every bite I took out of my bowl had at least 1 piece or more of salmon ( I got the Sunset bowl). 

I wasn't hungry enough to make this a meal, but my dining companions got edamame and taro chips. The edamame was good and I'd get that again. The taro chips, however, were WAY TOO SALTY!! I couldn't eat more than 2 chips never mind dipping into the jalapeno cheese sauce. Nice idea, but not gettng those when I come back. Despite this, I'd still come back here for the poke alone. Maybe try and burrito next time. This place has earned a spot on my to visit list while in town"}
{"text":"Usually a long line but they move it quickly. Consistent, fresh delicious food. Friendly staff that will give suggestions(easy because nothing I've tried so far has been bad)for what to eat or good combinations. They have some fun tasty drinks to try or just a soda fountain and Gold Peak tea if you want to keep the adventure to your food. I always get fish because I feel like that's why you're there but if you got dragged here by someone awesome there are boring options like chicken or steak for a salad or burrito made with a tortilla (white or whole wheat). If you are that person, then I highly encourage you to try some of the fantastic creations that they have come up with and step out of your comfort zone."}
{"text":"Their burrito bowls and sushi burritos are extremely filling at a stellar price. The firecracker is my favorite and is only $6. They also give a discount if you are a student."}
{"text":"Tried Soho Sushi Burrito for the first time and I'm in love! I got the caterpillar burrito and it will probably be my go to! I will definitely be a returning customer"}
{"text":"Sushi burrito! Amazing concept. Fresh and flavorful! You can watch as they create the burrito for you. They have so many options so it's up to your discretion on how you want your burrito. Definitely need to try this is if you want something different!"}
{"text":"When we visited SushiBurrito, we were warmly greeted by staff as soon as we walked in the door. The restaurant  was very clean and you could not smell seafood (a sign to go elsewhere) at all.  We loved the \"build-your-own\" option for our burritos (they also offer sushi bowls). Same concept as a Chipotle restaurant...except with sushi. I can dig it! 
There are options on the menu for \"pre-made\" burritos, bowls etc. if you prefer not to make your own custom creation. 
What an array of sauces too! A lot of the more premium ingredients are 50 cents extra. I'd say you could easily spend $11 for one burrito, but that is the cost of most specialty rolls at a sushi bar anyway. :) 
We will be back!

Side note: keep the wrapper on the burrito and peel as you eat, for a less messy eating experience!"}
{"text":"Tried this place after seeing photos others posted and hearing people raving about this place. I was definitely satisfied! There was a line but it moved quickly. This place is exactly like a chipotle, except for sushi. You can pick what goes in your roll and make your own, or they have set combos that you can order from the menu as well. Nice, quick and fast. The sushi burrito was HUGE and tasted great!! It didn't even fall apart when I ate it. 5 stars for sure :)"}
{"text":"Pros: Fresh, always busy, it's you have some who doesn't eat seafood they have teriyaki bowls, friendly staff, rewards system, friendly staff, and clean.

Cons: not nearly enough seating for the amount of customer flow they have. Lunch time is nuts crowds."}
{"text":"A big ass raw fish burrito... or perhaps a chicken burrito for your significant other if he/she is not a fan of doing it in the raw. (For a long term relationship, this could create some serious problems when it comes to eating out.)

NOT skimpy on portions. This place is an excellent choice if you want to stuff your face but can't do enough damage to justify eating AYCE. Or if you just want it fast and easy because sometimes you just need it that way.

The rice could use some work, but there's nothing you can't fix a little in Vegas to make it a Vegas 10. 

And promise... you will leave here stuffed with a smile on your face. See you for my next Vegas sushi hook up,  Soho!"}
{"text":"This place didn't disappoint!  It's the sister of the deliciouso SOHO sushi on Jones/Warmsprings!  As you walk in it's like a chipotle, subway, deli style ordering.  The line was pretty long at 1pm on a Thursday but it moved quickly.  I ordered the Triple S, which has Shell Crab, Spicy Tuna, Surimi Crab, Red Onion, Jalapeño, Cucumber, Tempura Crunch, Sweet Chipotle Mayo, Unagi Sauce, I had it wrapped in nori (seaweed wrap) and added the yuzu guacamole.  It was so Ono (yummy), packed with lots of flavor, however next time I'll have it in soy paper because it was a little hard to bite a piece of the burrito because the nori was a little tough.  We also got the kids California burrito, seaweed salad and the taro chips, it was so good!  The only negative is the lack of space because it was a little cramped w/ 2 mamas and 3 of our kiddos.  Overall I would definitely come back and just get these delicious sushi burritos to go and chill out at the park w/ my kiddos."}
{"text":"The Brightest Spot in an otherwise crappy day...
I forgot my lunch and as I was mulling over where to go on the UNLV campus, I remembered Soho and thought I'd give it a whirl. I'm glad I did. Soho serves sushi/poke fish with a Mexican presentation. Not up for burritos? Have no fear. Soho will also put all your food in a bowl.

And the bowls are HUGE. A very good deal for the price. 
Not in the mood for raw fish? Soho has options on the menu that are cooked and a Vegan bowl/burrito that I'll probably try next time I stop by.

I had the 3 Amigos bowl. Tuna, Salmon, Yellowtail, Masago and veggies. They have an open kitchen and make the food to order while you wait. If you aren't into won-tons and fru-fru mayo based sauces, they'll happily leave them off. 

Last of all the staff. The manager is really on point at this place. He saw my pathetic attempt to redecorate the SU floor with my chili sauce as I was wiping it up. As I went to leave, he asked if I dropped my bowl (I think he would've replaced it if I had). Anyhow he gave me more chili sauce and I went happily on my way."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi burrito places I've been to. I usually get the twin dragon roll as a burrito and it's stupid good, a ton of food, and reasonably priced. They wrap the burritos well as they don't fall apart while you're eating it like some others I've had.

There's often a line, but it moves quickly."}
{"text":"This is the most unique option in the food court in my opinion, it has lots of options on the menu varying from vegan bowls to sushi burritos with raw fish. You can either get a burrito or a bowl and the bowls are HUGE. My friend and I shared one the other day and neither of us needed any more food after that. The quality of the fish is really good, the veggies seem fresh, and they are careful to only put exactly what you want in the bowl. (My friend is allergic to avocado so she specified that she did not want avocado. ) The drinks are cheaper than I thought they would be and you can refill them like all the other restaurants so that's cool. I can't use chopsticks so I found a fork. Yummy and affordable option if you don't mind waiting in their line which is usually pretty long."}
{"text":"There are lots of sushi burrito options in Las Vegas - only Soho gets it right.  This is their second outpost and arguably their best effort to date.  Not only can you get their now well known burritos, but you can also get poke bowls and teriyaki bowls!  My office is around the corner from here, and once a week I see people in the office easting food from Soho. We all love it and for good reason.  The food is fresh, tasty, well prepared, and affordable.  The people who work there are well trained, but more importantly they are hospitable and welcoming.  Try the 3 Amigos, Twin Dragon, Lion King, or Fire Cracker as rolls (with soy paper), or the Hilo, Lahaina, or North Shore Poke Bowls.  Grab a Ramune Strawberry Soda from Japan, sit back, and enjoy your meal!"}
{"text":"Soho SushiBurrito just might be one of my favorite places to eat in Las Vegas.  They have a friendly attentive staff who quickly make the sushi burritos to order.  I prefer the soy paper to nori as my wrapper of choice, and the team there always has what I want on hand.  The decor is modest but warm, and it feels organic and natural.  The dining area is small, but they do make orders to go if you are in a hurry or need to get back to work or home.  The interior is bright and clean with lots of sunshine (well, it will be once the outdoor construction ends).  But the real reason I go here is the food.

The sushi burritos are outstanding, and cover a wide range of flavors and textures.  The hand rolls to try are the Triple S, Twin Dragon, and 3Amigos.  The Triple Dragon features spicy tuna, crab, and shrimp tempura, which are three flavors that work well together.  The soft tuna plays well against the crunchy shrimp, and all of the ingredients play well together (lettuce, guac, cucumber, crispy wonton, spicy mayo, unagi sauce),  Most rolls are at or under $10 and are quite large, so you are getting very good value for your dollar.   You can order the food as a burrito, or as a bowl or even nachos (which I will try next time).  You can choose one of their rolls, or make your own, and the also have selections for vegetarians and even for kids.  

They are open for most of the day, making lunch or dinner a good option.  I envision many more visits in the coming months!"}
{"text":"My coworker are awesome! Got me a twin dragon burrito. Super Ono! Can't wait to eat here again..."}
{"text":"The idea of a sushi burrito sounded terrible to me. I could not have been more wrong. My preference is the seaweed paper (tortilla was a little weird of a concept for me). First time out I tried the firecracker and totally was digging it. On the second outing, I got the same thing and on the third outing I got the Twin Dragon which also didn't disappoint. The price is right and the service is great as well."}
{"text":"It's like Chipotle, for sushi and is amazing! The staff is friendly, fish fresh and sushiburrito huge! Unlike regular sushi, I wasn't hungry in an hour.

I wish they Soho SushiBurrito would expand to California."}
{"text":"Soho didn't disappoint one bit! I got the Triple S burrito and it was spicy and delicious. Half of was just enough to fill my stomach. I used Uber Eats and they were quick and convenient! Definitely would order and eat here again!"}
{"text":"I always order through Postmates and I have yet had a bad experience! I always get the firecracker sushi burrito with sushi rice, on a seaweed wrap, I add lettuce, cucumber, masago, and unagi sauce! Keep up the great work and great food! I will continue to order from here!"}
{"text":"such awesome food...great service. nice friendly people. reasonable price approaches us if its our first time there and explained how it works."}
{"text":"First Time Here..A Little Nervous BUTTTT It Was Deeeeeelish..Lines Build Up Fast But Moves Along Quickly..Prices Are Between 5-11$. They Offer Military Discount(For All My Vets) I Actually Went Here Two Days In A Row.The Asada Sushi Burrito Is To Die For"}
{"text":"Sushi burrito?! Yes please. These things are GOOD! I would say try the Triple S or the twin dragon."}
{"text":"We came in on a whim... Opting for something semi healthy, after a night of studying. 

It's a very casual place... Dine in or take out. We chose to take out. We walked up to counter and chose our rolls. I opted for th vegan burrito... No vegan \"meat\" just extra veggies. The also have the \"veggie\" option. I love this place for even catering to the vegan weirdos, like me, of the world. They were out of the vegan chipotle sauce... I just had them add an eclectic mix of three other really great vegan sauces... Two were fairly sweet... And with the added Jalepenos to my burrito... It was quite the combo. The concept it pretty amazing.... I would
Come back and grab it again; I would just need to be in the mood for it. 

The other burrito we ordered, but I couldn't eat... Was the angry tuna. It's not vegan... And from what I was told... Rather underwhelming. My friend definitely preferred my vegan burrito. 

Both of us really like some crunch... And the taro chips are pretty freaking good. They are made in house... And I would totally consider having some of them crumbled into my next burrito. We also had a little side edamame, fair sized portion for the price! Our total bill came out to just over 20 dollars... Two burritos... Chips... Edamame... And a fountain ice tea. Definitely a good deal... And definitely a spot worth checking out:)"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Soho. There's one located at UNLV and I always go there for the sushi bowls.

Over in this location, I order the 3 amigos, the twin dragon, or the high maintenance as a sushi burrito. The employees are constantly energetic and over stuff my burritos. The ingredients always taste fresh and sometimes they hook me up with discounts :-)

I asked for their names and Melissa, Jay, and Via were always incredibly nice to me. They're very funny as well. 

The inside of this location is definitely smaller than the one on Sahara but it seemed just as busy. 
If you want to get a high quality sushi burrito with high quality service, Soho is the spot."}
{"text":"This location is just as awesome as the UNLV and the Badura location. 
Of course the Sahara location is crazy busy but it's worth the wait. 
All the staff are always so friendly, enthusiastic, and I enjoy talking to them when it slows down. 
I had one of the employees named Kim surprise me when he made my bowl. I was pleasantly surprised because the bowl was incredibly good. It was a mix of ahi tuna, soft shell crab, a couple handfuls of cucumbers, crispy wonton strips, roasted corn, red onions, and mixed greens.
I would definitely recommend the Triple \"S\", the 3amigos, and the High Maintenance. 

Thank you to Angelica, Karl, George, and Christina specifically for this visit :-) I also want to thank Justin, Kim, Tim and Dennis for my other visits because they make everything 11/10. 

I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"My bf ordered a to go order and we got all the way home with the food . Twindragon bowl with no spicy tuna and no chipotle MAYO SAUCE. So guess what's written on the lid of the bowl by the employee? No spicy tuna and no mayo!!!!. Guess what's in the bowl? Fucking chipotle spicy mayo!!! What a waste of time and money. Your job is simple. You obviously heard what not to put on it. You wrote what not to put on it. But you drench the bowl with what isn't suppose to be on it. One way to make a customer angry is to not follow direction and get an order wrong."}
{"text":"Love love love this place!! Yes the lines are crazy long especially during lunch and dinner but the food is so worth the wait!! Love me some 3Amigos!! Hope they open more locations!!"}
{"text":"I love the concept it is different and fun, although I think the execution was a little under par. The restaurant was clean and bright which made for a nice atmosphere, but the tables were tiny which makes taking even a family of 5 to dinner a little tough. The sushi was good but not great, I have definitely had better on numerous occasions. The customer service was kinda iffy. I didn't have any terrible experience but if I were the owner I would make my employees be a little friendlier. I hate when I am a customer and I am trying to, \"break the ice\" because paying the cashier is so awkward!"}
{"text":"We'll definitely be returning very soon! Delicious, fresh, and economical. The burritos are incredibly filling! The staff is quick and very friendly. Clean place, too!"}
{"text":"Wow I was so shocked by how good this place was! So I wanted AYCE sushi but the way my budget was set up I decided against! I always get the Sex Bomb roll at KAYA and love it so I looked up the menu and relayed the message ! I built my roll with seaweed wrap, sushi rice . protein was salmon,shrimp tempura, and eel. Sauce was Cajun aioli,eel sauce, and creme cheese. Toppings were Crunch and sesame seeds! Okay it came out soooooo good! My boyfriend ordered the dragon roll. We ordered edamame but they were really cold . I like mine a little hot with some dressing. They also had 3 dollars Sapporo . Such a good meal and less than 25 dollars for two people! Will be returning !"}
{"text":"AMAZING. Love that you can create your own. Perfect size. This is my new favorite spot. Actually been craving it since the last time I went there! Highly recommended. Wish it would stay open longer though!"}
{"text":"I love frequenting Soho and Soho Sushi Burrito.  It's never a disappointment when I go eat at Chef John's restaurant.  The same applies to his new location.  Staff are friendly and well trained.  I had the Hilo poke bowl and my husband had the Waikiki poke bowl.  So refreshing to eat in this summer heat.  The fish and vegetables were very fresh.  The sushi rice is prepared just as I like, well seasoned and sticky!  Good work Soho!"}
{"text":"The food was really good. I went there while visiting Las Vegas and was super happy with the food, prices, and amount of food we got for the money we spent. We went there around 1:30pm which is not considered peak hours for this restaurant, so the assumption was that it would be quick and without hassle. The employee that took our orders was awesome- really nice and smiled the whole time. The service until the checkout was efficient and satisfactory. When we arrived to the checkout, the cashier was pretty rude and condescending. The couple in front of us had happened to order the same thing and when the cashier asked them if this was their order, there was slight hesitation and confusion on their end so I said I think that's ours. The cashier replied with a snide remark about how everything was in order and they were here first...until the next 3 orders were out of order. Also, my boyfriend asked twice if the beer he ordered was included on the bill (it wasn't) and when he told us the total, he asked again if the beer was included (still wasn't) until he said, ''that's with the beer, right?'
Just be a little more respectful to your customers and next time it'll be 5 stars!"}
{"text":"This place is great if you want a quick good meal that is not terrible for your health. They have plenty of options. You can get a sushi burrito or a poke bowl. If you want low carbs you can substitute your rice with vegetables. This place fills you up and doesn't make you feel terrible like most other fast food restaurants."}
{"text":"I drive from Anthem because there's rolls are the best hands down I went to several new places closer 2 home but nothing compares to the fish quality and quantity and amazing sauces keep up the great work.... we love you xoxo"}
{"text":"amazing place. probably the healthier alternative. Paul (the manager) and the other guy named johanson were great people...johanson kinda looked like a mini Paul but regardless both guys were amazing and the place is clean and options to a seafood lover are endless. Will always come back."}
{"text":"Great food. Very creative menus. Food is fresh and high quality. My only complaint is the location! Move to downtown Fremont please"}
{"text":"First 2 visits were great! Sol ad this concept is finally in Vegas. The components were fresh and the service was quick considering all the customizing going on. I always opt to build my own and it's usually using shrimp tempura as my protein (it's basic but I love it whatever) and I loved that they heat up the shrimp before assembling the burrito. The crab salad is good and so is the soy paper. There plenty of sauces to choose from and the Yuzu soy is really good. They even have a machine to tighten up the burrito so it doesn't explode while eating like it would at chipotle. Price is great and good value to get a \"sushi\" fix in a hurry. 

My last visit wasn't so great. Also a shrimp tempura option and I felt rushed this time so I didn't notice till it was too late that it was cold tempura and when the girl who seemed visually annoyed from the start asked 4 times what my sauces were after I said one second let me read them. I chose two sauces and she DOUSED my burrito with sauces so the whole thing was soggy and I couldn't taste any of the other extras I had paid for. I realize they're not cooks or anything but just some common sense when you put them together. Would you wanna eat a burrito soaking in Yuzu soy? Probably not. 

Now that I've experienced indifferent service there I'll be more specific about the amount of things I want when I choose components. 

Other than that this place is solid. Good good good prices."}
{"text":"SoHo burritos is a smash hit! I came here for the first time last week with my co worker and it was amazing! I love the fast paced workers and how friendly they are! Having very knowledgable staff that can make some great recommendations for first timers is a plus for sure! I have to admit that this is one of those places that you just can't eat once! I will be returning very soon to try more of the delicious options they have to offer! I'm excited to see how this place will look once all the construction is done!"}
{"text":"I may or may not have parked in the 15min stall for about 27 minutes... in my defense.. there was a puppy that needed to be loved.
This place greets you as you enter so if you aren't paying attention you might get scared and enter your most intimidating ninja stance possible.

VEGGIE BURRITOS. -- so there's that... if anyone was wondering. I absolutely love veggies wrapped in other veggies drizzled in sauces and it kind of makes you wonder why you can't just make this at home?! It's so good!... because- no.. it tastes better if someone else makes it, that's why.

The price here is surprisingly low so.. live a little.. buy two burritos or try them all! 
I do know that I'll be back to try a few other veggie selections that they have.. in the mean time I will be on the hunt for an ice cream spot.. cookies n cream!!"}
{"text":"I always love coming here. The staff is always so friendly and helpful. The menu has a wide variety of items as well as build your own. The prices are very reasonable and the portion sizes are big. Other poke places I've found have had very small portions for so much more money. I highly recommend checking this place out. It won't disappoint."}
{"text":"The staff was super friendly. I loved the sushi burrito. It was cool that they were making it right in front of you. The sauces were good. This place is the best for sushi burritos. We got the caterpiller and triple s."}
{"text":"You don't know how happy I was to discover that they opened up their location off of South Jones and 215 (inside the Starbucks complex) as Chef John, Chef Nunu and Chef Jay continue to use the freshest ingredients. You can build your bowl with rice (white, brown or sushi) or salad. 
And they still build their famous sushi burritos here too!

The North Shore bowl is really delicious and refreshing with a mixture of shrimp and scallops and the perfect amount of Sweet Chipotle Mayo to balance the dish. By far my favorite 


Honopu is a delightful choice if you love octopus and Kimchi. I opted to add yellowtail to enhance the flavors. One of the great convenience of ordering from a place that caters to your liking.

Hilo Bowl was so delicious,  there are just no words to describe it. Flavor explosion from the very first bite. Perfect balance of all the ingredients it consists of. 

This place is a must try if you haven't had it yet. Friendly service,  wonderful location and amazing management team to create such an amazing experience to such a place to dine at with this type of food. 

Online ordering will be available once the website is up and running."}
{"text":"Friends and I stopped by and I was treated to a very delicious Vegan Lover  enjoyed every bite due to its freshness of avocados and jalepños ! Definitely mix a shot of blue powerade and fill the rest of your cup with the lemonade just because it's a nice colour and cools your tongue from the spiciness. The lucky cat displays are super kawaii."}
{"text":"The boys at work they were extremely nice to me and my family the food was amazing remind me a little bit of Hawaii with the great fish and freshness."}
{"text":"Previously my only experience eating a \"sushi burrito\" was at some food truck during a festival event. It was totally disappointing. Long line, high price, and hardly a burrito (it was so terribly small).

My experience with Soho was the complete opposite! I had a simple build-your-own style sushirito. Each component was extremely fresh and I was perfectly full after my last bite. I personally don't have a huge appetite so unless you really stuff your burrito, I can see how it might feel small to others.

To have paid about $10-12 per roll isn't too bad considering what sushi costs on its own. I did hold back a bit with my add-ons so it may not be the best price ever, but definitely not a deal breaker. I love Soho's sister restaurant as well so it was great to learn that this place is equally awesome."}
{"text":"Tucked into a plaza looking under construction. Nice menu display, friendly staff. Ordered a build your own burrito- Other Poke spots have been a little more flavorful. Rice wasn't as solid in the roll- you can see in the picture it wasn't as tight or packed with goodies. Comparable pricing to other spots. Not bad, just not as great as other burritos we've had in town"}
{"text":"My new favorite sushi place all the fish is fresh and I get a sushi burrito with no rice because I try to cut down on the carbs"}
{"text":"This place is incredible. Tucked away off of Jones and Badura it's by Starbucks. If you are a pro at eating sushi burritos like me, you'll find all your favorites here. Great, fresh ingredients. Sunny salmon is my favorite. If you are new to sushi burritos- get here quickly you are way missing out."}
{"text":"We came here because there was a long wait at the Oyster Bar.  That was a good move on our part.  This place is a fast food restaurant, which means that you order at the counter, they prepare it for you, you pay and find a table.  

The food here is very good.  They have many options, including vegetarian!  Price was reasonable for what you get.  Definitely budget friendly.  Service was great and staff were friendly.  And, they had Sapporo for $3!  Now, you can't beat that deal.  

Would I come back here again?  You bet!"}
{"text":"This place is seriously amazing!! I cant wait to go back here!! I had the twin dragon based upon what I had read on here, great recommendation for your first time. My boyfriend made his own sushi burrito and added pretty much everything lol the staff was all smiling and very friendly!!"}
{"text":"Came in for a late lunch with my mom. She let me order since she hadn't ever had a sushi burrito. We got an angry salmon and a twin dragon. The angry salmon was great. Fish was fresh and the flavors were good. Could have used a little eel sauce or spicy mayo to push it over the edge to incredible. The twin dragon on the other hand was overly sweet presumably due to too much eel sauce. The minced tuna that was in there wasn't very fresh tasting either so we had to kind of squeeze that out of the roll to make it edible. Soda fountain and four different kinds of peak iced tea. Dining area is basic but clean. Will probably come back to try out the other rolls. This place is more of a teriyaki sushi fusion place than any of the other sushi burrito concepts I've been to so far."}
{"text":"Staff is super friendly and helped us understand the menu As this was our first time here. Every single bite was pure deliciousness!"}
{"text":"Good place to get your sushi fix on the go.  I wish they stayed open later but it's close to freeway and quick."}
{"text":"I was an avid SoHo sushi customer until I went Vegan 6+ months ago. I've missed SoHo burritos too and was excited to see they had a Vegan Lover's Bowl/Burrito.  I didn't realize they always had Veggie/Vegan options! The Vegan Asada with Unagi sauce is delicious and now I'm hooked! They use Gardein so you can't go wrong. I love all Gardein products. Rose made my bowl and it was absolutely bomb!! Chef John knows how to create the perfect combination of flavors, super tasty. Thank you for making my first Vegan Bowl so yummy, ROSE. I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"After a long morning cleaning up some rooms at a friends new house, I was told that I was going to be rewarded with food. I was also told that this place holds the best sushi burritos. Like even better than the ones in SoCal. I had to try it for myself.
You can either get poke bowls or a sushi burrito. I got a sushi burrito (since I've actually never tried it in California before, so...idk how I'm gonna compare this with anything else).

They have a vast selection of menu items that you can either just order or customize and make your own. You can choose your wrap, it can be soy paper, seaweed paper, or a tortilla. The rice is also customizable. Sushi rice, white rice, brown rice, and I think the other option was like quinoa. I forgot.
I wanted to see if their menu items were good on its own, so I opted for the Tropical Sunset (I added roasted corn). This was definitely a really good burrito. The ratio of rice and toppings they add is mind blowing. Usually when I see pics of sushi burritos in California, they add a large/thick amount of rice. However, over here they add just a thin layer so you can enjoy the flavors more. Plus less carbs equal less sugar so. There's that. I don't think I feel the need to get sushi burritos in Cali anymore after trying this. I'll wait. If you have friends in other places who get the chance to visit Las Vegas, you should take them here. They will thank you.

Plus the workers here are super nice. They're very patient and cool so you don't feel uncomfortable ordering and feeling judgement like at other restaurants.

It's pretty spacious, I think it can seat around 10 people? Maybe more actually I'm just estimating.

TL;DR
Sushi burritos/poke bowls here are really good~
Come here and try all the different flavors.
They have a ginger and wasabi station nearby the cashier so you can add it to your food.
They have exotic Asian sodas."}
{"text":"Excellent concept...it works so well! Appreciated the option to create your own or go with a menu burrito. I had the lion king and it was delicious. Friendly to all sorts of appetites and dietary restrictions. I was also pleased with the price and their staff who worked quickly to get people through the line. Will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is bomb! Fast food sushi in burrito form is like a gift from heaven lol I ordered \"the triple s\" burrito wrapped in seaweed from the signature menu. It was very tasty. Also split the twin dragon with my girlfriend but I liked the triple S better. The taro chips are to die for! A must get. Service was fast and friendly even explaining the menu to us. I will be back again!"}

{"text":"Sushi burritos are BOMB.  For those who don't know what a sushi burrito is, it literally is an overstuffed sushi roll that's cut in half instead of into multiple pieces.

After I walked in with my girlfriend we were greeted with a loud \"SOHOOOO\".  I felt like I just stepped into a sushi restaurant, immediately I felt welcome.  

After walking inside you'll see the station where you order your food, and where they make it.  Up above is a full menu of pre-made burritos and also your option to build your own.  After going through reviews on Yelp, I decided to go with the Twin Dragon burrito, with everything.  It literally took like 3 minutes for them to make the burrito!  

Twin Dragon - The flavor is definitely there, it's so tasty.  The added won ton chips (I think) add texture to the burrito, and the seaweed wrap and sushi rice make it even more enjoyable.  A bit on the messy side close to the ends of the burrito but nothing a good ol' fork can't take care of.  The fish tasted very fresh, and I would love to come back to try the other pre-made creations."}
{"text":"SoHo Sushi very good Sushi in Las Vagus and they have happy hour 4pm-7pm. Everything so good here. Come to make your our Sushi"}
{"text":"Legit the best combo since peanut butter and jelly. I'm Vegan but I don't like tofu, so I was scared of the \"Gardein Asado\" (vegan protein substitute) I'm guessing its a play on steak, amazing... Flavorful and has a great texture"}
{"text":"I'm finally joining in on the sushi burrito craze. 

This place is a Japanese Chipotle-style joint. They have set items that you can choose from, whether it's a bowl or a burrito, but you can also customize your own. They have so many sauces/condiments that you can choose from as well; it was a bit overwhelming, and the workers were not helpful in explaining each of the sauces or which one paired well with what. 

Got the Twin Dragon burrito which included shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, surimi crab which is imitation crab, lettuce, cucumber, guacamole, crispy wonton strips, sweet chipotle mayo, and unagi sauce wrapped in seaweed. I also told them to add salmon sashimi in my burrito. It was pretty good. The vegetables were fresh, and the shrimp tempura and the wonton strips gave a nice crunch to the burrito. Don't expect Jiro quality fish here, but if you're looking for a quick bite during your lunch break or you're on the go, this place is worth a try. 

I will be back to try one of their bowls."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi burrito place with a variety of raw sushi options.  I like how they have different sauces and toppings to put in their burritos, such as kimchi crunches, won ton chips, mayo, seaweed salad, spicy sauces, etc

You get to see them make the burrito too, and they pack them full and tight!!  Love this stuff! 

They also sell burrito bowls too, but when I'm at a burrito place, I gotta get the burrito :). Yum!!

So this is basically a huge fat sushi roll, not sliced up. And I think the burrito is better than a sushi roll, in my opinion, because you get fatter stuff in the seaweed wrap and you have more ingredients inside. 

Also they have taro chips too - in 3 different flavors. They give samples too if you're not sure. 

Service was great here too.

Would definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"I have been frequenting Soho for the last few months, and I love their food, the freshness of the ingredients, the customer service, the location, everything! But today my visit was a little disappointing, when I got to the checkout and asked for the reward system they told me it had been removed and that today I would not get my free burrito for my 10 visits. I mean, I do not have any problem with removing the program, but (at least) they should finish delivering the rewards they promised."}
{"text":"Very cool concept like a Japanese Chipotle, but the line is so long and doesn't move quickly.    We got there at 11:30am only 30 minutes after opening and the line was at least 10 deep.   You can choose a burrito or a bowl with seaweed paper, soy paper, white or brown rice.    They have a menu with several already created options including sushi style items, steak and eggs, chicken options or you can just build your own.   We ordered the unagi special and the firecracker burrito style.   Both were very flavorful and packed with ingredients.  It like a very big hand roll, but unlike the hand roll it's a thin layer of rice so you don't get full from everything else and not the rice.  You can make it a meal and get a side and drink.  

When we walked in saw a sign for ordering online if we ever go back definitely using it since we saw several people just walk in and right back out with their food.   

They have some very fancy equipment to make the seaweed rice burrito wrap and a cool labeling machine.  Parking is pretty easy since it's in a shopping center."}
{"text":"Oklahoma is not hip enough to have sushi burritos, so I was very excited to try this novelty fusion dish with Sis and our Mimi.

So imagine a Chipotle but with Japanese decor and flair and much more fish in the menu. That's basically what it is like at SoHo Sushi Burrito. You step into line, pick out your burrito, bowl, or salad. Sis and I ordered burritos and Mimi ordered a burrito bowl. 

I had the Lion King, which had salmon and tempura, two of my tried and trues. If you're not into an overwhelming taste of seaweed, I recommend going with the soy wrap. I ordered the seaweed, which is normally fine on a sushi roll but it was a little much on a burrito. That did not detract from my overall experience though. We also tried the taro chips with queso, which were always very good. Mimi loved her burrito bowl as did Sis and her sushi burrito. 

SoHo definitely provided a tasty foray into this fusion food! The fact that it's right off Sahara made it even easier to get to for us, and I'm willing to bet we'll come again."}
{"text":"I'm addicted! When I was first introduced to the sushirrto, it didn't sound too appealing. Mind you, neither did sushi until I was hooked. Went to the original location my first time. Found out about this location (being much closer) and stopped in. Friendly staff and great food! Their sushirritos are the best. Been to a couple other places and keep coming back to Soho! Prices are reasonable and the food is outstanding! Highly recommend them. Haven't had a bad experience here. I recommend the firecracker with soy paper or the high maintenance in seaweed.. Now if they just delivered!"}
{"text":"First time here & I'm smitten  where have I been hiding that I've been missing out on this. Customer service was GREAT & environment felt very welcoming & positive"}
{"text":"Really like this place, cool spot to grab a bite of sushi burrito or bowl. It's right off the freeway, very convenient. The restaurant is clean and well kept. I ordered a 3 Amigos Burrito and switched the regular Ahi to a Spicy Ahi with jalapenos added. My girlfriend ordered the High Maintenance with customization, I honestly forgot what she got cause she's high maintenance (hence the food she ordered)... Jk, don't kill me if you read this. The staff were really friendly and patient, I like the fact that you can substitute your order with something else. Again I really like this place will recommend it for sure."}
{"text":"The 3 Amigos burrito was very tasty. I love their food so much we drove over 400 miles to eat here. Lol! It seems like no matter how many ingredients you order they always have no problem wrapping them into seaweed or rice paper. (Poke Bowls are also available.) Easy no fee parking across from Palace Station next to McDonald's. Inexpensive and excellent freshness."}
{"text":"Excellent food and customer service. Gave me recommendations and were very easy to talk to. I would come back but I came to Vegas for vacation. So happy I decided to stop here. Would love to see you expand preferably in the south Florida area."}
{"text":"Me and my daughter went here for dinner it was better than expected she order a California roll and I got the 3 amigos sushi burrito which was great!"}
{"text":"Stop in for lunch a few times a month. Same concept as chipotle but with sushi contents in a bowl or burrito. I love the kodiak!"}
{"text":"It was def. something new and well mixed fusion :-) loved it with happy hrs of beers for all day for only 3 dollars"}
{"text":"Im an addict! This is 100% my favorite go to spot in Vegas. I just recently found it about two months ago, and I've now gone over 13 times. If you check in each time with the Belly app you gain points. Once you hit a certain number, they give you a free burrito! Not only is the service always extremely fast but they are so much fun to see all the time. They are very generous with the portion of meat they give you too, which is a huge plus! I get the 3 Amigos and add spicy tuna and cream cheese... I also crave it once a week because it is that good! The prices are very reasonable for what you get. Ive been to a few other Sushi burrito spots and never end up going back to them. This one is forever my go to!"}
{"text":"Sushi burritos have arrived in Las Vegas, and Soho SushiBurrito is paving the way. I didn't visit this location while it was still Jaburritos, but I'm sure it was really similar to how it is now. 

Outside, they are doing construction in the area still, and hopefully will be done in the next upcoming months. The inside is small, clean, and simple. The menu is also really simple. You can order one of the specials on the menu, or you can go ahead and customize your burrito, bowl, or whatever else you decide to have that day. I have tried the twin dragon, triple \"s\", and the lion king, with the twin dragon being my favorite, and probably the most popular one on the menu. I don't think you can go wrong with how great sushi burritos taste and I don't see this slowing down. The only downside I would say is that it is just a little pricy for the amount of food you get, but this is a treat that can be enjoyed at any time."}
{"text":"I love this place! Greatest invention is the sushi burrito! Twin dragon burrito is amazing."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place off the strip where we could grab some good food, not greasy, and somewhat good for us. Came across this gem yelp and it didn't dissapoint. The place a moderately busy but we got in line and had our food within abou 10 minutes. All three of the burritos we ordered were great. Next time I think I'll try the build your own option and see what I can come up with. Overall, I can reccomend this place to anyone who has a sushi craving in a different form than a traditional roll."}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical at first but this place won me over . I had the twin dragon and my boyfriend had the triple S. Both delicious. You have a choice of soy paper or seaweed wrap for your burrito . The homemade chips are also pretty good."}
{"text":"The way they make their sushirritos here is much cleaner than the one at Sahara. It's very dead, for the most part, because they haven't been open for long."}
{"text":"If you're with a friend who doesn't like sushi, but you want sushi then this is place for you. 

If you want quality sushi, but don't want to sit down and spend 1 hour eating sushi then this place is for you. 

If you love the taste of sushi & the convenience of a burrito then this place is for you. 

I ordered the High Maintenance. Crunchy, fishy(in a good way), & filling. 

Not something I'll get every month, but definitely once a year."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in the area and in need of my sushi fix but I don't want to do an AYCE. 
SoHo is the spot!
To sum it up SoHo is similar to Cafe Rio and Subway in which they prepare the food right in front you.
It's worth checking out since they're the only place you can get a Sushi Burrito.

Would highly recommend"}
{"text":"Pretty great concept for a restaurant.  Imagine Chipotle but with sushi.  Pretty much it's a much larger sushi roll with all the fixins.  The meals are around $10+ and the quality of the fish is actually quite good for a \"fast casual\" type of place.  

I ordered the Twin Dragon, their most popular sushi burrito, per the chef.  Spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, and I added on some fish eggs.  Then couple that with some veggies, corn, unagi sauce, seaweed salad, and wasabi and you got yourself a great meal.  

It filled me up, it was fresh, and it was unique.  The only downfall was that the lines were huge during lunch and the burrito fell apart on me.  Otherwise, great job Soho SushiBurrito,  I will be back very soon."}
{"text":"So this place is pretty small, not typically a place I want to stay and eat at. Just kind of feels too sterile for my taste.

  I had a burrito with the soft shelled crab and I think if I would have nixed that crab I would have given this a better score. The soft shell crab is fried and kind of chewy so it messed with my gag reflexes a little bit. Maybe I'll give them another try one day so I can give them a better score cause
I really wanted to like it.

Other than all that, their food tasted fresh and they gave you options. Everything was packaged beautifully and the burrito was put together quite nicely. I didn't think all the toppings were going to fit but they pulled it off and still made it look nice."}
{"text":"Staff wasn't very attentive. And like many sushi/poke places, they tend to over flavor the sauce selection. I was expecting it to be the best sushi burrito in Vegas but I was dissapointed... it was just ok"}
{"text":"I love this place.. The employees are always so happy and inviting, I suppose I would be too if I ate sushi everyday..
You get endless options between bowls and burritos tons of toppings ans sauces.. The food is always fresh and the prices are good. I eat here weekly!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food had a 3 amigos on rice paper, it was fresh and delicious. Worth every penny. Friendly staff and it was clean. Highly recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Love this place. Located across the street from Palace Station on Sahara. Anytime I'm in the area for lunch, this is my goto. Place fills up around 11:30am most days, so come early to avoid waiting in line. I always get the spicy tuna on soy paper. The food has always been consistent and the service is good. highly recommended if you like sushi and have never had a sushi burrito."}
{"text":"My other favorite sushi burrito place in town. I come here for lunch often, as their food is tasty and service is fast. I like one of their specialties, the Three Amigos. It comes with ahi tuna, salmon, and yellowtail with Wasabi aioli dressing. The fish always taste fresh and their portion is generous. I usually order the bowl version and it's enough for both lunch and dinner for me. I wish they didn't charge extra for seaweed salad or avocado like sweet poke. If you come here for lunch, either come for an early lunch or for a late lunch because they get quite busy and the place is small, so seatings are limited. If you're not into raw fish, they offer sushi burritos with cooked proteins like grilled salmon or chicken. My coworkers really enjoy the Cheesy Asada, which comes with grilled steak."}
{"text":"The very best in sushi burritos. I got the Triple S and added seaweed and I already can't wait to go back and order that again. Quick, great service, but small dining room which gets crowded leaving minimal room for divining-in."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here. I got there about 40 minutes after they opened, arrived to see a short line, was greeted by friendly staff, ordered the Fire Cracker (spicy tuna, spicy sauce, cucumber, cabbage, crispy wonton) on Soy Paper. Food was made very fast and I was out in less than 5 minutes for under $6. Great atmosphere, very efficient service, great experience overall."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and attentive service.  If you are new, they help walk you through your options. You can customize your bowls with different proteins,  toppings, and sauce choices."}
{"text":"This place was BAAAAHHHHHAAAAMMMMM!!!!!! It was flippin great!! Great service, the place was clean, they were quick and had great recommendations! Def will be back soon. I'm a fan of sushi and never thought of a burrito lol but this is A1! My boyfriend knows I love sushi so he made me shut my eyes before entering lol he's never had sushi and this was our first time"}
{"text":"I love SoHo! My go-to order is the Twin Dragon on soy paper, easy on the guac. This is the best place to order online from and run in and get it. Eat at Soho with confidence. It's amazing and filling!"}
{"text":"Just tried Soho SushiBurrito and was really excited about the Japanese/Mexican fusion of flavors!  Had the Vegan Lover burrito (with tofu as they were out of Gardein asada) and it was excellent!  Enjoyed the green tea (sold in cans) as well."}
{"text":"If you want a break from all the heavy American and Mexican food you've been punishing your body with, this is definitely the best choice for that. 

Refreshing, filling, healthy Omega-3's and so budget friendly!

The 3 amigos was great! 3 fresh scoops of raw fish, with the works. The burrito is large and will fill you up just right! No guilt here :)

The carne asada bowl was super delicious. No exagerating here. Excelllent for people who don't eat raw fish, lots of protein, fiber and flavor. 

I am just so happy i found this place. One can only eat so much buffet food and for the health conscious, you need to visit here. Just a short drive from the strip (don't forget to hit up the nearby escape room afterwards)"}
{"text":"It's a pretty trendy fast food restaurant in Vegas now. We came here for some brunch, we tried most of the sushi burrito on the menu. 
-taro chip is a must, but I don't like how they coated it with sugar, if they can provide other flavors on top will be good, like Cajun 
-3amigos was good combination of some sashimi 
-angry tuna was a bit fishy to me, plus the seaweed 
-triple S was good combination, highly recommend 
For me it's like a poke style with Japan hand rolls concept, it's not bad to try it out."}
{"text":"I had the twin dragon burrito three nights in a row at EDC. It has shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, crab and so much more! It's delicious and perfectly filling. The people that worked there were super friendly and happy to be there. I wish there was a location in San Diego, but I'll just have to go to EDC again next year, so I can get my hands on another burrito. (I just ate at Caesars buffet, and now my mouth is watering as I'm typing this). Damn you soho and your bomb sushi burritos!!"}
{"text":"Loved it! With the exception of the way they scoop the spicy tuna into the burrito everything else is awesome. Tip for when you go have them spread the spicy tuna that way you're not getting mouthfuls of it. Kinda tastes like spicy baby food if you get globs but other than that pretty damn good!!"}
{"text":"I've been a few times now and love it there. Once the wait was 40 minutes long and I wish that they were able to serve faster but I understand that it's hard to meet the demand in a made to order set up. 

Please open a location in Downtown Summerlin."}
{"text":"Interesting concept. 

I went here last week before taking flight back to pdx. This place combines the sushi roll concept with the build your own burrito style (almost reminded me of a Chipotle). Since I don't eat seafood,  I opted for the cheesy Asada burrito. The steak and melted cheese wrapped in a soy based wrapper with a thin layer of rice and veggies made it quite tasty."}
{"text":"Yes yes and more yes! Words can't describe my love for this place. Soho offers a new concept,  sushi burritos. Wrapped in either soy paper or seaweed and filled with fish, veggies, sauces, and your choice of brown or sushi rice the combinations are endless! I always get the soy wrap, brown rice, ahi poke, crab, hanenaro honey sauce, seaweed salad, extra jalapeños, cucumbers, and ginger. Absolutely amazing! If youre a fan if spicy definitely try the honey hanenaro sauce! I highly recommend this place :)"}
{"text":"Good variety. Haven't tried all the different combinations but you can something different every time. Food quality is good and quite tasty."}
{"text":"I love their poke bowl, fresh fish awesome spicy sauce. Service is great. This place is a must try for all you fresh fish lovers!!"}
{"text":"Construction did halt my excitement for a minute but it is a nice little place inside. Walking in was a bit intimidating at first considering I have never been but the guys behind the counter are very helpful with selections from the menus. I opted for the Twin Dragon.  Which was a good choice in my opinion. 

You have the opportunity to add some additional fresh toppings if you like. We made it into a meal so I got edamame and a drink they offered in the fridge next to the cash register. 

All in all the food was delicious and it was a different way to eat sushi. I would maybe suggest making the seaweed a little longer so the bottom could be folded but I really didn't care when I took the first bite."}
{"text":"I am definitely a fan of this place.

So in a nutshell, it's like having a sushi roll in the form of a burrito.   This place is pretty busy.  I tried to call in an order for pick up but they wouldn't take pick up orders.  That was a negative for me but they told me that they can get me out of there in a timely manner.   Upon arriving there was a line.  I want to say I had about ten people in front of me.  They were moving customers in an adequate amount of time.  

I ended up ordering the 3 amigos on soy paper with cream cheese.  This usually comes with a wasabi aioli sauce which isn't a bad mix to this burrito.  I think that it would work well with its spicy mayo as well.  That will be for next time.  I also ordered their taro chips.  If you don't get anything, at least try the taro chips.  They are awesome.  It's sprinkled with a Furikake Seasoning.  

My burrito was pretty good.  The blend of the different ingredient was like having a party in my mouth.  Just a whole lot of flavor and texture happening.

Will I come back again?  Of course!

With that being said, Happy Eatings!"}
{"text":"Perfect meal for lunch and dinner! The ingredients are so fresh and it taste good! First time trying this shop in Vegas and it didn't disappoint me. Definitely will go back again!"}
{"text":"Wow heaven in my mouf...I got the Triple S without the surimi crab, aka \"krab\" (crab knock off) and just got extra spicy tuna. You can build your own or order one of their specially made ones. My man wasn't too crazy about the taro chips he got. Decent prices, can get a bit crowded during the lunch hour but the line moves fast."}
{"text":"Though located in not the most convenient for tourists, this place is worth going to.  The concept is so simple, yet novel and fantastic.  And the customer service is phenomenal.

I went at 2PM on a Saturday, and there was still a long line for their delicious food (though the line moves quickly).. You are allowed a choice between soy paper or seaweed paper topped with a layer of sticky rice.  You can then pick individual ingredients (Chipotle style), or you can ask for a premade combination.  Picking individual ingredients can get complicated if you are unfamiliar, so I just opted to go with premade.  I tried the high maintenance and the 3 amigos, both of which were tasty.  I think the high maintenance had more flavor, but the 3 amigos had more quantity of fresh fish.  The masago was also yummy.  The portion is perfect and the food is healthy.

Someone else had accidentally picked up my friend's burrito at the end of the line, so that my friend ended up with the wrong burrito.  When my friend brought it up to the cashier, they apologized and made him the right one immediately (while letting him keep the wrong order). I thought that this was professional and nice.

Loved this place. Highly recommend. Would return!"}
{"text":"People are fantastic, prices are right. And the food is amazing! Would recommend anyone who loves sushi and burritos here to try it out."}
{"text":"I love sushi burritos, but their prices are a little much compared to what's been opening up and what they give. Don't get me wrong, is still go here, but they need to change things up a little to retain the business they had when it was just them"}
{"text":"so good!!! go try it now!!! the triple \"s\" is bomb & the twin dragon... filling, fresh and flavorful. I get my burrito with sushi rice & seaweed wrap... just like a roll. you won't regret going here!"}
{"text":"I went to a similar sushi burrito restaurant (Jaburritos) during my residency interview in Las Vegas with a friend; not sure if it was this location before the name change or a different location. Nonetheless, it was not my first time having a sushi burrito.

Though there is a lot of construction going on in this plaza at the moment, Soho SushiBurrito IS open! The line moves quickly and it's basically like Chipotle only with sushi. I found the sushi rice machine fascinating; it stamps out a perfect square layer of rice. There are several sushi burritos to choose from, or you can custom create your own. There are also some fun sides (e.g. taro chips) and Asian + non-Asian drinks to choose from. They even have mochi ice cream!

Portion is okay. Perhaps it's a little pricey for what you get, though the quality is good and food is tasty."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch yesterday with my coworkers. There is a list of burritos and bowls that they offer as well as build your own. 

I decided to make my own and added a scoop of salmon and the bowl was still affordable (under $12) after extra for seaweed salad. I like that you can include quinoa as part of your bowl. 

Additionally, there's a small bar near the cashier with wasabi, ginger, etc. They also provide dessert, snacks and milk tea!"}
{"text":"I ate here for a solid 7 days and tried a lot if their dishes.

Very yummy dishes!

They even have brown rice and soft shell crab as options too!

Best restaurant in Vegas for only around $10!!"}
{"text":"The staff was quick, courteous, and very friendly!

I went with a coworker who is Vegan and the Staff made sure to be extra careful with her meal without her having to ask. They even used different knives and scoops to ensure that her meal was truly Vegan.

In addition to the Staff, the food is DELICIOUS! I recommend the Twin Dragon. I'm a fan of the Bowls, but I have had the Roll and they are both amazing.

Truly one of my favorite food places in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I've had a few sushirittos and they've all been superb. Everything was fresh, service was prompt and informative, and the overall experience was very enjoyable. I'll definitely be going back often!"}
{"text":"I don't have anything negative to say about this place. I ordered 2 sushi burritos and they were yummy. They also offered military discount which was cool."}
{"text":"This. Place. Was. Amazing! I can't believe it took me this long to find a place like this. I had seen a similar place in San Francisco and didn't have a chance to try it. When I googled it I found this place and I am SOLD. I tried the 3 Amigos which had Salmon, Tuna and Yellowtail with red onion, cilantro and Wasabi Aioli. It was quite busy which is good as that shows the place is going to be around a long time. I think next time I will make something of my own since you can do that too!

Don't think. Just go. Now."}
{"text":"Great fresh food, clean place to eat, friendly staff., if you want to try a topping that's uniquely Asian   , it's the Pickled seaweed., I don't think it's seaweed really, does anybody know?"}
{"text":"Pro:
1. So many options to choose from. Knowing what you'd like to eat prior to the arrival would help a lot. Especially if you have very limited time. 

2. Food tastes great. 

3. Size per portion is just enough. Some might need more than 1 order. 

Con:
1. Cleanliness needs some more attention. Especially on dining table. I had to ask a bottle of cleaning chemical to the cashier since the table was so dirty & I had a 2 YO daughter with us. She gave us a cleaning rag instead. 

2. Lacking of basic knowledge of cleanliness/sanitation. 
What concerned me the most, is that when she gave me the cleaning rag, it was passed over our food. That's a huge No No in food industry. 

3. Man's restroom was not lockable. I accidentally opened the door when a kid was using it. I suggested the kid to lock the door when he uses the restroom. Yet, when I tried to lock the door, it wasn't successful. 

What if there was a pedophile taking advantage on that kid since you fail to maintain the basic safety toward your patrons. God forbids on that. Restroom need to be check hourly & documented for the cleanliness, functions, & its safety. 

4. Restroom was not cleaned."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner today. The wait was a little long, but the sushi burritos were bomb af. 

I ordered the Caterpillar and my husband had the Twin Dragon. Both were absolutely delicious. Everything tasted fresh.

I was holding my keys, which had my work badge attached to them, and discovered there is a 10% discount. That was a nice surprise.

I'll definitely stop by again the next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"We were very disappointed with the service here today. My little girl's favorite place Ted's Sushi, recently closed and she was very sad, especially since she has food allergies and can't go to many places. I called Soho ahead to see if they could change out the crab in the kids burrito and put chicken instead. The lady said ok, but I had to ask it several times for her to understand, English must have been her second language.  When my husband got there, they would not make it for him. We ended up getting a create your own for nearly nine dollars. We would have made this our weekly place for my daughter, but instead, my husband came home, very frustrated with the poor service."}
{"text":"Great first impression. Smelled great, looked clean, everyone was happy, food was good. I'll definitely spread the word and return."}
{"text":"Amazing concept at such an affordable price. Great quality and fresh. Good service. Will definitely come back in the future. Wish I had one of these back where i live, Miami."}
{"text":"I'll keep my review short, I love this place!  Everything I've had is delicious and I get friendly and fast service.  My husband is shy on new things so one night I just brought him home a burrito I thought he'd like, the very next night he asked me to bring him another one."}
{"text":"They are so friendly and helpful. I love there burritos and everything tastes fresh and looks fresh. The owner is a nice person. Just a worrying the burritos are addictive, big and can get messy. If you don't like fish they also have cooked chicken."}
{"text":"Just got a burrito today for the first time in a year. Have to say I'm disappointed with how little fish they give you now. I remember before, the fish slices were small but now it's a little ridiculous! The amount of fish was like less than 20% of the burrito, definitely not how it should be. Sad cause I used to love this place."}
{"text":"Both sushirittos were great. I made the mistake as they were rolling it and ordered 3 different pre-made options because it looked deceivingly small. If I could go back I would only order 1 or 2 at the most, it was filling. Their burrito rolling machine is snap chat worthy."}
{"text":"Whoever invented Sushi burritos is seriously a genius. That is all. Oh, and get the caterpillar burrito. You're welcome."}
{"text":"Another great trip to Soho it was fresh as always, very tasty, fast and friendly customer service. Highly recommended,  Keep up that great work don't change a thing."}
{"text":"Fabulous!!!! Great food, good prices, nice place and friendly staff. Unique idea, we loved it, we ate there for 3 days in a row, even though we had to drive there. Wish they go to NY!!!"}
{"text":"So I walk in today because I wanted to try this craze going on the sushi burrito lol, when I walked in around 12pm it was packed I thought to myself might as well wait. There was about 20 people ahead of me but the line was moving by the time I got to order there was a line behind me out the door. I ordered the 3amigos because I love ahi tuna salmon and yellowtail. Once I got my order I open it up in the car and it look delish. Took a pic and then took a bite lol and it was yummy. I will be back to try some other burritos."}
{"text":"I ate here a few weeks ago since I had a few hours in between classes. I wanted to try some of the dining options inside of the Student Union as I had only been to the Starbucks but since I avoid fast food as much as possible I chose this joint to avoid the Taco Bell & Panda options. I ordered the Sunset bowl with brown rice.The salmon was reallyyyyy smelly & I could tell that I had just paid $7 to hurt myself. Also note this is a\"fusion\" place so my poke bowl was actually not poke but salmon mixed with jalapeños & onions. I'm from Hawaii so I'm a little strict on what is considered to be poke & this is not it. The people working here are nice hence the two star instead of one. They do have vegetarian options so I may have to give this place a second shot to see how those are in the future but I wouldn't order any fish/poke bowls from here."}
{"text":"I cannot begin to tell you how mad I am that someone didn't invent sushi bowls sooner.

The 3 Amigos is a definite winner in my book, with the Mango Soy sauce and whatever toppings suite my fancy on that day. Don't forget to get the tempura dots on top, to add the perfect crunch.

Much like their counterpart sushi restaurant, this place is tops in my book.

Now, just open a location in Tivoli Village and I will be the happiest man on earth."}
{"text":"The name may have changed but the quality of flavor is still the same. I stopped in for lunch for me and a co worker and while the plaza is under construction I didn't even realize the name was changed until I went to order. Looking up at the menu board I saw my go to burrito wasn't there. After talking to one of the workers they explained the change in name to the business and menu and told me what my favorite options new name is. Been here a few times since the change and the only issue is they are a little slow building a burrito when it gets busy but that won't keep me from being a regular customer."}
{"text":"I love coming here. The staff is really friendly and quick, and the fish is always fresh. The prices are pretty good also. If you're a broke college kid like me, you can still get your sushi fix (Firecracker burrito is only $5.25)"}
{"text":"Although I've had my hesitations about soho, I have remained a loyal customer until today. I usually make one or two trips per week on my way. About 3 weeks ago while my burrito was being made as it was almost finished one of the girls found a hair, when the told the first person on the line to make a new one he got very defensive and made a face, I didn't receive any kind of apology or anything all the girl said was \"good thing I found it.\" As if I was the one who put it there.....moving forward to today I stopped by after work to pick up a burrito on my way home, line was short and quick which was perfect. When I got home I dug in like any other person. Only after 4 bites I found a hair in my found. With the weak stomach I have clearly I gagged and threw everything out. Will not be returning back to this location ever again, little mishaps I can agree with were all human, but 2 times in less than a month? NO THANK YOU!"}
{"text":"I came here tonight with my brother! we both got the twin dragon & two drinks. The meal itself is delicious! it tastes fresh and is quite filling even though it doesn't seem like it would be. The only thing that is bothersome is the price. For this meal it was around $30. That is pricey. Also, the place is small. Therefore it's very noisy & hard to find a seat. I'm not sure I would come back because of the price... but it's definitely worth trying!!"}
{"text":"Always a people pleaser.  I bring visitors from out of town here and they love it. Usually packed, which is a pain, but we end up waiting anyway.  My favorite is the Angry Tuna, not spicy, it hits the spot every time.  They also have some secret options that are not on the menu, so if you ask about it, they will tell you.  

When I'm hungry and leaving town on a long drive, it's a great place to get my sushi burrito for the road, totally satisfying and makes the drive easy.  When I do stay though, I wish the ambiance was better.  I guess they try to get people in and out, as it's not really a hang out spot.  Doesn't change my rating, but a more cozy vibe inside would be awesome."}
{"text":"I love all of the soho locations I've visited so far! I especially like that they mix your bowl up for you, saves me time and keeps the fish intact. I like to get salmon and ahi. I really wish they would provide more gluten free sauces (ie packets of tamari soy sauce). The staff was very friendly and they knew about how to handle allergies. Make sure to ask for gluten free versions of the sauces!"}
{"text":"Had my first sushirito yesterday! I have to say I was quite happy with the experience. First off it was nice that they had some gf sauce options (although I would love it if they added gf soy sauce, even if it was just packets). The burrito I got was seaweed, sushi rice, salmon, spicy tuna, avocado, and cream cheese. I can honestly say it was delicious! I feel like the price point is reasonable as well!

Edit: Make sure you ask for the gluten free versions of sauces!!! I didn't know this until yesterday"}
{"text":"A few people I know love this place, so I was curious to see what the hype was about. I decided to do the build-your-own burrito. I pretty much based it off of the 3 Amigos, but modified it to my liking. 

I got:  
* Sushi Rice Wrap

* Meat - Ahi Tuna ($7.50), Fresh Salmon (additional meat = $1.5)

* Sides/Toppings (free & no limit) - Cilantro, Corn, Red Onion, Tempura Crunch, Crispy Wonton Strips, Cucumber, Furikake 

* Sauce - Wasabi Aioli

* Extra - Cream Cheese (50 cents)

Total = $10.29

[PROS]
* I was satisfied w/ my order. It was yummy & filling 
* The cream cheese was totally worth it & made it even better
* The fish was fresh & they serve a generous amount
* They're open on Sundays now. I was bummed that they were closed on Sundays, but now that they're open, I definitely plan on eating here  after church or something

[CONS]
* Their menu is a little overwhelming just looking at it (especially as a newbie). But, once you get their concept, it's pretty cool & unique
* It's a bit messy/dirty inside. Although we went there near closing time, I was a little bothered at how messy it was
* It's quite loud inside. Not sure if it's the music or just the acoustics in their restaurant, but I had to speak louder than normal to have a conversation w/ my party
* Although I enjoyed my roll, it tasted no different than a regular sushi hand roll.. But just wrapped & the size of a burrito

I'd definitely go back & try their Asada, or create a non-traditional sushi roll. Maybe that'll give me the true experience of Jaburrito aka Soho Sushi Burrito"}
{"text":"Loved it! I appreciated all the selections of protein to choose from such as soft shell crab, tamago, spicy ahi, shrimp tempura and many more. They also had different sauces to choose from and veggies. My favorite being the unagi sauce and chipotle mayo. Sides range from lettuce, pico de Gallo, green onions, cucumber, ocean salad, masago....  Workers were also friendly and the set up of each person to station makes the lines move fast and very efficient. Can't wait to go back! 

Building may have construction going on outside, but all businesses are still open!"}
{"text":"I love this place a d the food is great but reasonly they been giving less portion and when i asked them can u put a little bit more salmon and the guy wasn't happy and he charge me extra charge"}
{"text":"These guys were not only patient with ordering as a first time, but the food lived up to the hype! I can't wait to come back and try another sushi burrito! Hopefully they add more options! I would love some eel!"}
{"text":"I continue to return to Soho for lunch as it's close to my work and it's a great healthy and lite option. It's basically a build your own set up much like a subway concept but for Sushi which can be made in a sushi burrito, sushi bowl, salad or nachos using taro chips. The portions are quite good for the price. I've ordered both in store and online. The online ordering system is extremely easy to use and I never get spam emails for them. The only downside to their online ordering is the wait time. I've waited up to 45 minutes to receive the \"your order is ready\" email. I do really love that they have a small condiment bar where you can get pickled ginger, soy sauce and wasabi for there or to go. 

Typical Order:
Bowl w/ Mixed Greens 
Salmon Raw (additional order protein $1.50) 
Onion
Cucumber
Bell Pepper
Seaweed Salad (add charge)
Avocado (add charge)

Sauce: (choice of two) 
Habanero Honey Sauce 
Wasabi Aoli"}
{"text":"Fresh option for lunch or dinner and has online ordering! I've gone during the lunch rush and it's not too bad. The line goes by fairly quick and seating wise i would say only seats about 20 people if that. So you may want to plan on coming just before noon or after 1pm. I have ordered online which is extremely simple however sometimes it can take up to 45 for your order to be ready. I recommend just going in! The reason i love this place is because i'm such a fan of their actual sushi restaurant. The quality of fish is great and the services is nothing less than perfect

\"SOO HO SOO GOOD\" *Tip, you'll get it."}
{"text":"Yay, been meaning to try this place out for the longest. And I say this because my roommates have been there, at least, 5 times in the last week. Sometimes twice in a day! 

Got here 30 mins before closing and had my heart set on the charsui pork belly bowl with curry sauce. Added garlic shrimp for 1.50 more. 

Staff was really friendly and noticed they had little to no pork belly and garlic shrimp for my bowl, and asked if they could make a new batch for me -- heck yah, new new!!! 
And even tho I asked for steamed veggies, the said they added steamed broccoli for me, too. That was so dope of them! Maybe it pays to go before closing ;) 

BF for a DIY poke bowl with soft shell crab, ahi, seaweed salad, corn, mixed greens, yuzu dressing topped with tempura crunch. 

And got the Waikiki for another roomie. 

Got home and devoured the garlic shrimp. Pork belly wasn't too fatty and decent thin slices. Had so much leftover for lunch today! 

Tried my BF's DIY poke bowl and was really impressed by the dressing. Had me wishing I ordered a salad instead. 

Overall, they have great choices in protein. Different from other spots, which makes them stand out! Heck, even their crunchy toppings are different that you can choose 3 different ones! 

Staff and organization seems more fluid. I mean, they have their spot on Sahara to train with. 

Super happy to have them in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Yesterday I ordered a Waikiki bowl from here and used Grubhub to deliver to my office. 1. I'm having the worst diarrhea ever since last night( haven't eaten anything since this bowl). 2. I paid .50 to add some avocado, it was not in my bowl. 3. Delivery took more than 30 mins and when I get my food, miso soup was cold, salad was warm. 

Warning people who's thinking about order deliveries from this place. Don't do it, because your food will turn bad on the way to you, and they don't care because they put no efforts to try to keep your food at the right temperature. 

SOHO, I'm not suing you because I never thought it would end up like this, I lost all evidence but I think I'll report to the health department. Please keep your food fresh and be responsible to your customer's health."}
{"text":"This isn't my first time having a sushi burrito and I thought this place was pretty tasty. Wished that my burrito was wrapped a little tighter though because when I unwrapped it and took my first bite, the filling came out from the other side. Boo :(

I think this is a pretty unique place that can attract people not just for poke but for regular burritos. I like the variation they offer just in case you change your mind about wanting fish or a burrito."}
{"text":"OMG... my husband and I really enjoyed these burritos. We got the 3 Amigos and the Twin Dragons. The flavors worked really well together and the portions were good. My husband was working a trade show at the World Market Trade Center and it took me about 30 minutes to get the food to him because of the craziness that is parking there... and I was worried because I thought the seaweed paper might have gotten soggy, but it was okay. Sushi Burritos! Such a great idea!"}
{"text":"If you are really craving sushi and dont want to admire the beauty of the art of the roll and all the elegance of Traditional Japanese catering than this is the place to go. You can get a roll filled with decent ingredients that is fuzed with some Mexican culture and served in a burritoe. Japan and Mexicos food baby."}
{"text":"Soho is always delicious, a great alternative to sushi prices.  Think of it as a giant sushi roll or handroll.  I always customize mine, start with the Triple S, no jalapeno & no chipotle mayo.
I add sesame soy sauce, add ahi tuna, add green onions, and everything else it comes with is ok.  Some extra sesame soy sauce on the side so the burrito doesn't get mushie.  The staff is friendly and clean place."}
{"text":"Vegan options are all delicious! It's nice getting some different options as a veghead. You can ask for your sushi burrito double wrapped with seaweed and rice too."}
{"text":"Not bad! Finally tried one of these sushi burritos everyone's been raving about and it was just as tasty as I imagined. Mind you, I ordered via UberEATS so I didn't get the full dine-in experience at Soho - but the food that got delivered was impressive. I tried the Twin Dragon burrito with brown rice and sweet chili sauce, while my coworker tried a Caterpillar burrito, light on the rice and cream cheese. We were both very pleased with our dishes. I'll definitely be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"3 amigos burrito with sushi rice and make it a combo, my favorite...I was happy to see this location as I was driving by...definitely two thumbs up!  :)"}
{"text":"The 3 amigos, is my favorite sushi burrito in town.  I've have larger and cheaper burritos, but the blend of flavors is the best...so I keep coming back...Grub!"}
{"text":"Pros: AMAZING food, decently priced, super friendly service, customizable, great to bring friends from out of town to
Cons: It can get pretty crowded at peak times and even random times in the day... but it is worth the wait!

I recommend: Everything is good, but my absolute favorite is Sunny Salmon with Twin Dragon and Triple S after that; taro chips with cheese; new spam musubi burrito!

I LOVE this place. Love it. I crave it regularly. I bring my friends from out of town here. I tell so many people about this place. It's just so great. I've been a fan since their \"Jaburritos\" days and although they tweaked the recipes a tiny bit, it's still absolutely fantastic. 

For the price, the portion is absolutely huge. Think about it- a sushi roll at an average sushi restaurant is at least $10... For that price, you could have a JUMBO roll in sushi burrito form! They aren't skimpy when they're making your burrito either. They want you to be happy!

The service here is so friendly and polite. They do write which burrito is which once it is wrapped so no need to worry if you're ordering multiples. I haven't made my own burrito yet because I like the \"premade\" ones so much. The new spam musubi burrito is amazing as well. Don't forget to order some taro chips at the register! 

I have nothing negative to say about their food and service. They have something for everyone (if you don't like fish, they have meat or a tofu/veggie option; if you don't like seaweed, they have a soy wrap option, etc etc). This place is amazing and if you like sushi and you haven't hit this place up yet, you are missing out- plain and simple."}
{"text":"First time there will definitely go back. Twin Dragon and 3 amigos , two amazing burritos."}
{"text":"I really liked the service and the sushi was really fresh. Definitely a new place to eat."}
{"text":"The guy working there was super patient with us as it was our first time there and we were a bit lost. Service was amazing and so was the food!"}
{"text":"Only had a chance to try the Veggie Lovers burrito and it was amazing! The only downside is the burrito falls apart if you don't eat it fast enough. But it's absolutely incredible!"}
{"text":"This place is basically the chipotle of sushi lol. Quick fast service,food is amazing. Food is very cheap! Large sushi burritos which are just uncut sushi rolls. Last time I went they got my order wrong and they gave me another burrito for free and I probably wouldn't have even noticed the order was wrong lol. Only thing i dislike is the condiment section I wish there was more to choose from besides just soy sauce and that red chile sauce, wasabi would be a nice addition. Small store but it's fine more like a Vegas gem hard to find the better. Most def will be coming back"}
{"text":"After a long night of partying I needed protein and veg to replenish my body. So delicious! We had the 3 amigos and the s factor? It had soft shell crab and spicy tuna (which I subbed for salmon for an additional 50 cents.) i requested light sauce for both but kinda wish I had more sauce bc it tasted a little bland but I didn't wanna overdo my calories. You can also build your own burrito or bowl ( concept is similar to chipotle) and choose your protein, veg, white/brown rice, etc. comes out to about 10-15per burrito depending on how extravagant you want to get. 

Also, the person who docked stars from this restaurant because they didn't serve corn or flour tortillas should really reconsider their review. Why would u put sushi and japanese ingredients in a corn or flour tortilla (aka diabetes wrap) when you can use healthy premium ingredients like seaweed or soy paper?"}
{"text":"This was my first sushi burrito, which I was really excited about, but turns out it's just a big sushi roll...uncut. I don't know what else I was expecting.

This is a solid place if you're craving sushi, but be aware the fish is definitely not fresh and lacks any flavor. The servers were really nice though and stacked my burrito full with toppings. I really enjoyed being able to customize what I wanted. I would advise against getting the cup of seaweed salad though. I love seaweed salad but was disappointed that the cup I bought ended up being a pretty small amount, especially for the price I paid.

Overall, it was a good experience just to say I've tried a sushi burrito, but otherwise would not come here again."}
{"text":"Friendly staff fast service fresh fish. 
But why oh why do restaurants allow non-service dogs? Is that even legal?"}
{"text":"Friggin life changing. I had the 3 Amigos and my husband had the Spicy Dragon. They were amazing. I was afraid of the size of them compromising the taste or quality, and we were not disappointed. It was phenomenal. I want to eat there for every meal now."}
{"text":"If you haven't tried a sushi burrito yet then stop reading now and get directions. It's very hard to find a place that doesn't serve a great sushi burrito these days, and soho is one of the best in the business."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's a  perfect fix to my sushi craving! The firecracker is the best! The habanero sauce on it is to die for! I can live without AYCE sushi any day as long as this place exist!"}
{"text":"One of the best bites I've ever had. I got the Twin Dragon, it was sooo good. I had taro chips, they were also good. 
I wish they would open up in Henderson. I love this place."}
{"text":"This was my second time here. The first time I came there was basically no one in here, but today it was PACKED! Waited in line for a good 20 minutes, but that's ok because the food and service were great. This place is basically chipotle except with sushi! You can make your own burrito or pick one of the options on their menu. You can get a burrito a side and a drink for less than $20 
I would recommend the 3 Amigos"}
{"text":"Average. The menu wants u to get a burrito or a bowl.  I asked if there was real sushi and she said u can make ur own ... I tried the salmon was tasteless.  At the end after I had ordered I saw traditional sushi was on a menu only visible at check out I just wanted good salmon!!!"}
{"text":"I would eat here at least once a week if I could. I made my own bowl with salmon and tuna and it was amazing! Compared to similar style restaurants, their fish is much fresher and their portions are more generous. The guys behind the line were very helpful and seemed to actually like their jobs. My friend got the sushi burrito with unagi and it was very good. Not sure if it gets super busy the restaurant maybe had 15 tables at most, so you might want to avoid the lunch or dinner rush if you want a table. Would definitely come back here ASAP!"}
{"text":"Our go-to dinner pickup spot when we visit Vegas for Evo. They now can deliver via Uber Eats so it is even more convenient and accessible. Everything that I tried there (3 Amigos, High Maintenance, etc.) tasted so fresh and flavorful. Just writing a review about the sushi burrito makes my mouth watery. If you like sushi and haven't tried this place yet, you should definitely pay a visit before you leave Las Vegas. And those of you who live there already, I envy you so much that you can eat this yummy sushi burrito any time you want! :-)"}
{"text":"Finally decided to give this place a try today 9.5.16. Initially it wasn't what I originally wanted to try today but being a national holiday a few place was closed so my sister and I went on Yelp and stumble across this place and remembered a few of my co-workers & friends mentioned about this place. 

As you walk in this simple and modern setup of a fusion Japanese & Mexican restaurant with a BYO-Build Your Own Concept. You'll notice the Maneki-Neko (Japanese Cats Figurines) which is seen throughout the establishment with Sombreros hanged on the walls. We were greeted by the friendly staff and a guy approach us to ask if it was our first time here. He was very helpful and patient with us. We ended up getting their Twin Dragon Bowl & 3Amigos Bowl. Got a bag of Taro Chip-Cheddar Cheese Flavor with Cheddar Cheese dipping sauce. (Highly recommend the Taro Chip-simply delicious!). Our bowls was very consistent and filling and the fish was very fresh. Especially the Ahi Tuna and Salmon. Then again, I'm biased with Tuna and Salmon but I do enjoy Yellowtail too which is why I chose the 3Amigos because Tuna, Salmon & Yellowtail is my fish of choice whenever I'm having Sushi. We didn't try their Sushi Burrito but will indeed come back to try more of their items."}
{"text":"Fabulous food.  Fresh takes on some classics.  Give it a go,  you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"It's still awesome that they brought an Asian-Mexican sushi burrito fusion to Vegas! Sure the thing cost around $10 for one item, but the roll is huge! You can even customize your own towards your craving desires! They even do seaweed or rice paper wraps or bowls if you don't feel like eating it as a roll. Of course if you are allergic to fish or certain items, they also have cooked meets to replace the fish. Yes they do follow hand hygiene and sterile procedures for people who are allergic. This place is still busy and small, so try to get there before or after peak hours (Lunch and dinner) for less of a wait."}
{"text":"So far in the past month we have been here almost every week. It's so good!!! Price is awesome too!! And I don't even live near this place!! I find it easier to use their app to order just because of all the options I feel a bit overwhelmed when I'm ordering in front of them because there's SO many choices. I usually do a build your own sushi burrito bowl, quantity and quality are both awesome! Their taro chips are also super good. If they ever open one by summerlin south I'll be in trouble."}
{"text":"I really like this place. I like their customer service, food, menu and atmosphere. If I had to complain it would be regarding their small interior space and their parking space but other than that, they are on point with it all. My favorite is their twin dragon roll on brown rice with avocado instead of guacamole and spinach instead of lettuce."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of the SoHo Sushi off Jones and Warm Springs. I'm an even bigger fan of SoHo Sushi Burrito off Sahara. I'm so hooked. This place is bomb. I ordered \"Sunny Salmon\" - salmon, crab, pico de gallo and cream cheese and added extra shrimp tempura for only $1.50 more. 

I love how you can totally customize your burrito and if you're not feeling that, you can create your own bowl as well. I hope they open one in the south side **hint hint wink wink"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch around 1pm and the line was almost out the door! The line moved fairly quickly though since there were quite a few workers on the line making your orders. 

Being a big fan of sushi, I had no idea what to order since everything sounded so good. I ended up getting the 3amigos since it seemed to be one of the most popular items. The size is pretty good and the fish to rice ratio was just right. They don't rip you off by filling up the burrito with more rice than fish. The fish tasted fresh and overall it reminded me of something I could get at a sushi restaurant but in a larger form. The Mexican flavors didn't stand out too much with this one. I also ordered the taro chips with cheese...sounds very strange but somehow it works and it was so delicious! The chips are coated in a slightly sweet and salty seasoning, maybe furikake? I highly recommend getting a side of this along with your sushirito. I will come back to try some of the other menu items! 

Seating is limited so if you come during a busy hour you might not find a seat. Be prepared to take it to go just in case!"}
{"text":"I was welcomed with a big \"Welcome to SOHO! ... then the entire team says \"SoHO\" and I loved it. They also said a few things when people did others etc but I was too busy trying to decide how to build up my sushi burrito for the first time! I love that it's a build your own and you can add in whatever you want but the price is based on the fish you choose. I went with half ahi half salmon. I was a bit disappointed in the size of the fish chunks, they were very thin and small. Other than that everything was amazing."}
{"text":"I love it I go here almost everyday and get the triple S and a miso soup I would seriously recommend going here if you want sushi on the cheaper side but still fantastic and want it to or just want to grab lunch with friends anyways if you're a sushi lover like me I suggest you give this place a try and don't forget to download the app named \"Belly\" you can check in each time and get points you can spend on drinks or a free sushi burrito hopefully you enjoy :)"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!! The food is always the bomb & the staff is very nice & helpful! It's always clean & I can get in and out quickly when I run in on my lunch break. You guys rock!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here a lot -- from its soft opening as Jaburritos, the first day of its transition to Soho, and regularly since then. Unfortunately, the quality has been going way downhill. This is a really bad time for them to start slacking, considering all the competing sushi burrito places that have opened or are opening recently. 

Today it got the worst it's been--my Triple S burrito was so poorly assembled and so drenched in sauce it was slimy and gross to hold and the soy paper immediately started disintegrating. My boyfriend's Angry Tuna was similarly poorly done, although his didn't fall apart while he was eating it. 

I want to be loyal to this place but when the burritos cost $10.50 each, I don't have to. I've tried a couple of the other new places in town and they're good enough or better to replace it for me. I'll probably come back and if this keeps up I'm done for good."}
{"text":"This is based on take out only. Wow is all I got to say this place has some great sushi burrito. I was a little skeptical at first. We had the make your own burrito and it was awesome. It was so awesome we went for lunch and dinner the same day!!

We will be back to try other things!!"}
{"text":"I get down on some soho sushi burrito. Ive tried a few other poser places trying to bite their style and they just can't compare. The staff here are all very friendly. Im always greeted when I walk in the door. The food is  fresh and delicious asnd they have so much to offer besided sushi. They have burritos and bowls, veggies and meats and several really boss vegetarian options as well (try the vegan lover you will not be dissapointed). Ive made a habit of coming here whenever I can and I bet you will too."}
{"text":"YUM! Have gotten a sushi burrito twice now, so yummy. I have been a huge sushi person and this tops going to sit down and indulge, you get all the yumminess in every bite! They also offer sushi burritos for kids with artificial crab, my 2 yr. old daughter loves it!"}
{"text":"I've gone to Soho before but only for my coworkers and I would just get something from work at Port of Subs but I decided to try it today and wow I wasn't disappointed. I created my own bowl and got white rice with shrimp tempura the unagi sauce jalapenos green unions guacamole and cream cheese with wonton strips and tempura crunch. It was seriously so good I had to stop myself from going back and getting another one. Staff has always been super friendly and helpful and honestly it's not that expensive. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Omg where do I start? We heard about this place from one of our friends. The Sushi lovers we are we had to go and check it out. The drive was sooo worth it. I had the 3 amigos and it was so unbelievably good. The fish tasted fresh and the wasabi aioli was perfect. We also tried their Taro chips. I don't like cheese sauces on chips so I ate them without it but who needs it anyways,that's how good they were. If you don't want to go to your usual Sushi Spot this is the place to go. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Worth the drive!!! I love getting their bowls always fresh! Great customer service always!!!!"}
{"text":"Lemme tell y'all something, I was sick with zero appetite and a sore throat but the foodie in me forced myself to visit SoHo SushiBurrito while visiting Las Vegas as it was the very last place on my list to check out. Despite feeling like crud, I thought my burrito was pretty damn good. I really love the sushi burrito concept but the places that try to make them back home do a pretty terrible job. I got the twin dragon and added masago. I was really pleased with how much shrimp tempura, spicy tuna and surimi crab was put into my burrito. This place does not skimp. I almost thought they weren't going to be able to roll up my burrito properly because of how much stuff they put inside. The burritos here are well proportioned. The ingredients are pretty decent quality and fairly priced. The only thing that I didn't love was the guacamole in my burrito. I love guac as much as the next person but in a sushi burrito I'd prefer just straight avocado. I still love SoHo SushiBurrito though! Please expand to Dallas!"}
{"text":"John has done it again. I am a huge fan of the Sahara location, but this is so close to home. Everything is fresh and delicious. I couldn't be happier. Big thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place after hearing that it's so delicious here. I do live further away from this place though. Wish there was one closer to my side of town. I came here for lunch and it was pretty busy. You can customize your sushi burrito or you can choose from the ones on the menu. I decided to order the Twin Dragon sushi burrito. If you like spicy tuna and shrimp tempura, definitely try this sushi burrito. It's definitely a decent size and they cut it in half for you. The Twin Dragon was delicious and filling. 

I would like to try other sushi burritos on the menu the next time I come again. I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"This place is so bomb! Great value for the price. The line was long but now I see why! I'll be eating here a lot more. You have to go try it out!"}
{"text":"The burritos are amazing! Had a twin dragon and was delicious a good amount of heat and sweetness"}
{"text":"Ive wanted to try this type of food for a long time on a Drive by I found this Place so glad I did it was so good. would so recomend this place for a Sushi Burrito resturant was a little small they were very busy Take out is the way to go."}
{"text":"Food is fresh and good.  I would recommend the bowl over the burrito.  The burrito always make my stomach hurt."}
{"text":"Place is clean
Friendly staff
Yummy and fresh food
Fast service
Just avoid lunch hours, line gets pretty long!!!"}
{"text":"Service is quick, and the staff is super nice. The food is good and the restaurant is clean. On my first visit I tried the Twin Dragon bowl, Jalapeño Sour Cream Taro chips, and Miso soup. Everything was pretty tasty, but just a tad on the salty side."}
{"text":"new style of the sushi and pretty good flavor if you want to ear the same sushi as a burrito sized"}
{"text":"I have now been here 2 days in a row and I'm pretty sure the employees will be seeing a lot of me. I've only had the twin dragon with no guacamole sub cream cheese but good lord it's amazing and I'll be trying some new things. The service is good. They do their job and they're friendly, so no complaints here. Id say this is a good alternative to AYCE sushi because the \"burrito\" is super filling and the cost is equivalent to one sushi roll if you decided to order a la carte. It's great when you're craving some sushi! Also, both times I went they were fairly busy and I had to wait in line. But the line moves super quick since they make it right in front of you. Awesome place! :)"}
{"text":"Very fast and fresh. I enjoyed the concept and the bowl i had was only ok. I blame myself because i didnt order off the menu I opted to build my own and some of the flavors werent quite complementary. But they had loads of options and i would go back."}
{"text":"Husband and I were in Vegas and yelped lunch reataurants in the area and decided to give SoHo Burrito a try...didn't disappoint.  Tried the 3 amigos burrito and hubby tried Twin dragon both were delicious.  On recommendation also tried taro chips with cheese and taro chips were very tasty and the cheese dip took it up a notch.  Definitely will come again when in town."}
{"text":"Was here for the first time and loved it!  My son ordered 3 Amigos and it was delicious!  You pick what you want to put in your burrito.  Just for one cost about $11 without drink and chips.  The services were helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"Had great experiences ordering sushi burritos via post mates for a few weeks. Loved the quality and every type I've tried.  But now every time I try postmates calls to say they don't accept phone orders.


I'm very confused. Is this establishment now just choosing to not accept phone in orders or just services like postmates. Either way very disappointed. I love the food but not every one has the time or the ability to make it out there to wait in line. 
You're losing business and a lot of it if you continue to refuse to take postmate and like services' orders. Its just a to go order."}
{"text":"Let me first say that I do not always condone the fusing of foods. But when I do, raw fish helps!

Long lines, loud ambience, too many neophytes. Has that turned you off? Good, don't go so the lines won't be as long when I do. 

I really do like this place. The fish quality is pretty good; I've not had anything that tastes fishy, just fresh. What really is amazing is the amount of food you get for the dollar. A $10 Twin Dragon and I am almost uncomfortably full. 

My favorites are the Angry Tuna and Twin Dragon. Also, pro tip, get the soy paper as it makes the burrito easier to eat. You can make a big thick cut sushi roll with nori, but it's too chewy/stretchy for me. 

Now that the facade construction is mostly finished this place has gotten busy again, so please be put off by my review so I can eat here more often. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I was a little hesitant about trying a sushi burrito but I'm so glad I did. Now I'm addicted! Today I tried a different place that was closer to home and it could not compare to Soho. Great customer service as well. Will definitely be back even if it's out of the way"}
{"text":"Love this place. I love the concept and the burrito are amazing. I would highly recommend the 3 amigo or the twin dragon. It is a very busy place"}
{"text":"Ultimately it's just a giant sushi roll.  meh

The way it works is Subway style, you walk up and order what you want through an assembly line.  My third visit here, but first under Soho, I went with the same and my personal favorite customized order which consists of the seaweed wrapper, sushi rice, and I chose tuna and salmon with cucumber, green onions, seaweed salad, and poke sauce.  When I order a custom roll this is what I get also but seaweed salad on the side.  They have specialized burritos you can choose from as well if you don't know what you want.  I do think it's cool how the rice dispencer works though, spreads it out evenly on the sushi wrap.    

If your taste buds can handle sushi then I definitely recommend coming and trying this place.  Be warned, the taro chips they have here is very good.  But I feel as though the passion for sushi has been dumbed down here."}
{"text":"Our office got takeout one day from Soho SushiBurrito.  I gotta say I was a bit skeptical at first, I mean, a burrito-sized sushi roll?  Is that even gonna work?  But wow, it was oh so SOHO good!

Being my first time ordering I stayed on the cheaper side:  Fire Cracker ($5.25) - spicy tuna with cucumber, cabbage, crispy wonton strips, sweet chipotle mayo & honey habanero sauce.  Also added surimi crab for only an extra $1.50!  Not a bad deal for under $7!  Added a side of shiso tomatillo sauce for FREE!  Really though if you ask, they will let you have a side of just about any of their sauces, gratis.

Tasty!  Even after the travel it had to take from the restaurant back to my work office!  So surprising, sushi...in a burrito!  I thought it would have been too big to enjoy like regular sushi, but you can bite into this bugger easily like it's a huge hand roll!  Ingredients were fresh too.  The nori wrapper wasn't soggy, rice was cooked well, and the spicy tuna and surimi crab were well seasoned.  The fresh cucumber, cabbage, and crispy wonton strips added much needed texture.  The sweet but tangy honey habanero sauce added some nice kick!  Their shiso tomatillo sauce was an easy add too, I recommend it.  Like a tomatillo salsa with an added umami element.

The burrito was big enough I only managed to eat half.  Took the other half for the wifey to try!  She thought the concept was strange at first too, but after her first bite of leftovers she was sold.  She liked it very much!

I think a visit is in order to Soho SushiBurrito again in the near future for some Asian inspired eats!

BANZAI!!"}
{"text":"Firstly, this place is my favorite sushi burrito place in town. BUT TODAY, today was just horrible. Consistency is key. I did the B.Y.O sushi burrito and I got seaweed wrap, soft shell crab, shrimp tempura, avocado, unagi sauce, and sweet chipotle sauce. Usually when I order this everything is distributed evenly. The sauce was dripping out and couldn't even tell what I had inside of the burrito. It was not appetizing. I really hope they stay consistent with their orders. I would still come back. Maybe today was just a bad day and maybe they just had new employees. :( Other days it would be 4-5 stars but today is a 1 but giving them an extra star because they're amazing all the other times I've visited. I just couldn't eat my other half of my burrito. Smh. Very disappointed.


Updated review: 11/19/16 
Ok so, way better experience! :) sushi burrito was made very well this time! (New pic update!)"}
{"text":"I made my own burrito and it was sooooo good. Had unagi, tuna, and all kinds of stuff wrapped up in a seawood burrito. It was great. 2 times out if 2, it was great. I make sure I stop by at this place whenever I am in vegas, along with the grand buffets and all the amazing foods in vegas. It is so worth a meal."}
{"text":"Loved it! I got the twin dragon, and wanted to make a few substitutions on it and they were more than happy to help and accommodate my needs. The final price came out to be about $12, and most of the \"sushi burritos\" are priced around that price. It was sooo good, I already can't wait to go back. It tasted really fresh, they have a lot of different options, you can customize your own thing, and they also offer bowls."}
{"text":"Second time I have come here.. second time finding a hair in my food. First time, honest mistake which is totally fine. But a second time.. why.. definitely turns me off from getting a bowl here."}
{"text":"Tried the sushi burrito with soy paper. I got it with salmon and soft shell crab. It tasted really good but I was surprised at how small the portion was given the price (especially compared to sushi burritos in LA which are cheaper and bigger). 

They have quality ingredients though and the staff is very nice. 

We ordered online and it took 15-20 minutes until it was ready for pick up, which is average for fast food, though they weren't very busy inside.

Also tried the sushi nachos. They ran out of tortilla chips so we got the taro chips with cheese seasoning. It tasted better than I expected. Worth trying."}
{"text":"Whoa.

What?

How did I not know that this was a real life thing?

We placed our order online for pickup and I really like that they give you the option to build your own with everything you want in it, especially because I am kind of a picky sushi eater... 

At first I was kind of taken back by the pricing, ($11.50 for my custom burrito) but then I realized that when I go to all you can eat sushi is around $24.50 so I was really saving money, right??

Any who. The burrito was amazing and super super filling! 

Thank you to whoever looked at a burrito and wished there was sushi stuffed inside of it.

You're my hero."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time today.  This is great fast food.  Fresh.  Good service."}
{"text":"Sushi burritos are still a little too off-the-wall for me but I love DIY poke bowls. After hearing numerous rave reviews about Soho, I decided to skip my go-to spot for poke and give them a try. Sadly, I was not overly impressed with my visit or with my bowl.

Soho is fairly small, in a shopping center that doesn't have a lot of nearby parking. When I arrived around 11:30 am, there was a line of people waiting to order as well as a cluster of people near the register trying to pay and/or pick up to go orders. 

Service was friendly, but three employees making bowls and burritos and only one cashier to ring customers up, answer the phone and assist the pushy Uber Eats driver did not seem sufficient. 

My bowl contained a nice sized portion of protein. I would like to see a wider variety of sauces and more traditional toppings. I got white rice for my base and was disappointed to find golf ball sized clumps under the protein and other toppings. Also, if you are going to charge extra to add avocado, it should be pristine and not browning.

Lately I have been trying to give places multiple tries before I review them, but with so many options for poke bowls in the area, I don't see myself returning to Soho Sushi Bowlritto anytime soon."}
{"text":"When I think of poke, I don't think sushi burrito. 

When I think sushi, I don't think sushi burrito. 

When I think ESPN's Sportscenter, I think of Soho SushiBurrito.

I know, it sounds odd. The SH for Soho looks very similar to SC for Sportscenter. Now that I got that off my chest, let's discuss what Soho SushiBurrito is known for and that's, you guessed it, a sushi burrito. I've been here a couple of times and recently brought some friends here. They totally loved Soho. They loved the assembly line ordering process, the different sushi burrito options, the price, and of course, the taste of their meals. It was my friend's recommendation to come here.  And prior to ordering, they wanted to know exactly what a sushi burrito is.  My response...just a bigger sushi hand roll. That's really all a sushi burrito is, right? The difference is that you get a lot more in sushi burrito than you do a sushi hand roll.  I really can't hate on this place or any of the other sushi burrito spots in town because people love this stuff.  We sure have a lot of them coming up and they all tend to taste the same to me. Just don't come here expecting super high quality poke or sushi.  The quality comes with the price and in my opinion, the price is pretty good.  The other good news is that the sushi is fresh and the toppings are almost endless. I will get mine with just salmon or spicy tuna with imitation crab meat and chipotle mayo.  I'll eliminate the rice and go straight seaweed when I want to keep my starches down.  My sushi burrito is pretty good and cost about $10. My only issue is that the food here is not filling.  Take my advice and don't come here hungry.  

The service is great.  Soho is very popular and there's almost always a line.  The employees are always efficient and extremely patient with peeps that get to the line undecided. Be on the lookout for a table because they fill up quick.  

NOVICE TIP:  If you're not into fish or sushi, then check out their taro nachos, chicken burritos, and steak burritos

2017 Yelp Review #89"}
{"text":"Visited at 12:30 pm on a Wednesday.  Lunch crowd was in full effect, but the wait time was minimal. Under 10 minutes from the line, order, and paying out.
Service: 5/5 I was thoroughly impressed with the efficiency of the assembly line crew that put together my sunny salmon sushi burrito.  They were friendly even though they were extremely busy.
Food: 4/5 The Sunny Salmon Sushiburrito was tasty and not messy to eat for a sushi burrito.  The burrito was packed tight to keep the eating easy.  Ingredients were fresh. The seaweed salad I had with my combo could have been fresher, but definitely not an issue.
Value: 5/5 The combo of my Sunny Salmon Sushiburrito, seaweed salad, and UCC grean tea drink was $11.94 before tax and tip for a savings .50 vs a la carte.
Summary:  Service and food has been consistently good from my previous visits.  The seating is limited so I usually take my food to go versus sitting down.  I noticed on this visit that Uber eats delivers for them and it might be something I'll consider when the schedule is tight.  A great place for SushiBurritos to go"}
{"text":"I love burritos and I love sushi! Put them together = a match made in heaven. 

So it was my first time here and right off the bat I was super confused with the entrance. The exterior of the store is under construction so don't be fooled, they are open! Besides that, once you walk in, the place is super welcoming filled with positive vibes. 

As for the food, the Three Amigos is pretty fail proof. It is packed with a plethora of fish with a kick of wasabi aoli. Its super refreshing. However, I love a little more spice and crunch in my palette, so the Triple \"S\" is my favorite! The Twin Dragon would be my choice for something in between the two :)

P.S. if you're a lover of condiments as I, they have a little stand filled with wasabi, soy sauce, ginger, Verde sauce, etc. Such a nice touch!"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at Soho SushiBurrito. Don't be fooled by the construction on the outside of the restaurant. It's open! =] My coworkers and I got there a few minutes after it opened. The line was really short but I noticed just about 10 minutes we got our food, the line got soo long!!!! I got the triple S which had soft shell crab, spicy tuna, surimi crab, jalapeño, masago, cucumber, red onion, tempura crunch, sweet chipotle mayo, and unagi sauce!! I underestimated the size of the burrito but it is such a big portion! You will be full. But of course my hunger took over and I ordered another burrito for a snack haha and I never do that! I got the spam sushi roll which was tasty!! I want to go back and try other rolls!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The food is always amazing and the people are very nice and patient. I came in before closing a few times and they still took my order with great attitude."}
{"text":"I first visited a John Chien Lee sushi burrito restaurant when he was in the Jaburritos business partnership a year ago. I finally went back to another one today.

Soho Sushi Bowlrrito is a more recently opened variant of this concept that's just one street removed from the Rainbow Blvd hotbed of similar restaurants. This place runs pretty much the same menu as now-a-separate-brand Jaburritos and the original Soho Sushi Burrito except for the addition of poke bowl options, and it looks like a cozier (read: smaller interior) version of the original restaurant.

If you're unfamiliar with this trendy genre of restaurants, they run a model that resembles Chipotle or Subway. There is an assembly line, lay out all the proteins and veggies, and let you choose what you want starting with the form (sushi bowl, sushi burrito, or poke bowl) and base (sushi rice for everything except poke bowls, white rice, brown rice, or mixed greens). They do provide a big menu to guide you, but they ask you whether you want to add more toppings (some free, others premium) - and unlike my friend and I, you should definitely not hesitate to add more of the free ones, including a sauce or two.

I got the Triple \"S\" ($10.50) sushi burrito w/ soy paper first to confirm that it was the same thing as the equivalent menu item from the other restaurant. I think they may have forgotten to add the unagi sauce, but despite that omission, the mix of proteins (surimi, spicy tuna, soft shell crab tempura) and the crunchy texture of the veggies more than satisfied me. It's superior to another sushi burrito that I recently tried from a newer restaurant.

I also had a Hilo poke bowl ($8.50) with sushi rice, which is a yellowtail-focused recipe. First impression: huge portion, including ample fish. This hamachi was as great as the stuff that they serve at the actual Soho restaurant. I didn't realize that I'd be getting flatter seaweed a la miso soup instead of the typically delicious stringy seaweed (which I did see behind the glass), but the other default toppings of black pepper, green and red onion, and sesame soy were almost enough on their own to complement this protein. A healthy dose of soy sauce from the sauce bar sealed the deal, although I'll have to consider adding a sweet sauce next time. Only real issue: no sushi rice for this menu, just plain white rice.

Finally, I also checked out the taro chips ($2.49, or a small combo discount that was 50 cents for the drink I chose), choosing the original furikake after the cashier thoughtfully provided samples; I decided that cheddar seasoning and jalapeño sour cream obscured the taro flavor too much. The chips are a great crunchy side to add texture to your food, and the complimentary cheese sauce complements the chips as a solo snack. I also really appreciate that they use a paper bag with a closing/sealing mechanism, which allowed me to keep it fresh to enjoy with my leftovers.

Soho Sushi Bowlrrito isn't perfect, but they're my favorite (and my wallet's favorite) take on customizable sushi burritos and poke bowls so far. They're very good for a casual or quick meal, which is a different niche than a premium meal (for which you should probably consider OG Soho) or an AYCE sushi place (for truly ravenous eaters)."}
{"text":"My buddy told me to try this out and I love it!!!  They are super friendly, the place is clean, and the food is great.  I use the app which was a a breeze and everything was ready when I came in!!!"}
{"text":"this place is like chipotle on hawaiian crack & i thought i loved chipotle. pft.
the vegan carne was surprisingly so delicious, I'm normally scared of the fake meat but oohwie. and they have so many options you just don't know what to do. the taro chips ...BOMB. miso soup for $1.55? HEAVEN. &its not a million dollars!!!!!! its so good. I've been craving it since the last time i ate this godly soho. must.eat.now"}
{"text":"The service is nice and I like their sushi rice, but I was really unhappy with their ahi. The quality seemed off but more than that their portioning with a bowl was unappetizing compared to the business I am used to. Overall it just didn't feel fresh and the tuna itself left an aftertaste. I might have enjoyed it more if I'd gone for their steak or the like, but I go to a sushi burrito place for tuna."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place after being in NYC and realizing the sushi-rrito is a revolution happening right now across the USA. Couldn't believe we had these places in Vegas, so as soon as I got off the plane from my vacation on the east coast I had to check this spot out. 
I got a custom salmon/eel/avocado roll with some of my favorites added. The roll was fat (I like a LOT of sushi lol), and for about $10 filled me up a lot more than $10 at a typical sushi joint! 
The fish was very fresh tasting, all ingredients were on point. My only complain is I wish this place was my next door neighbor I could get freebies at once a week =) 
You NEED to try this place at least once. You won't regret it, if you do you may not have a sushi soul."}
{"text":"I love this place!! I had the triple S I believe its called and tried the twin dragon. They were both absolutely delicious I will definatly be going back to eat and recomending it to friends the prices i believe are fair"}
{"text":"Holy guacamole.  Ate here twice out of the four nights I stayed in town. Don't even think twice about passing it up.   Just go."}
{"text":"This is NOT the location we visited.  We went to a similarly named place with the same logo way the hell out in Henderson because the web site is so confusing.

This is just the neatest concept EVER.  My husband had the beef kimchi sushi burrito (think sushi-roll ingredients wrapped in seaweed, the size of a burrito) and I had the \"Waikiki\" bowlrito (think deconstructed sushi roll served in a bowl) with brown rice and ahi tuna.  Both of us were absolutely THRILLED with our food; however, I have to ding them a star for the aforementioned confusion (causing us to drive WAY out to Henderson, whereas our hotel was on the corner of Sahara and the Strip), and another ding because the ordering process is a nightmare, especially for a first-timer.  I am neither sexist nor racist (I'm a gay man married to a Korean man), but the Asian women behind the counter taking the orders assembly-line style spoke in such high-pitched, loud voices and so fast that I had to ask them to repeat everything more than once.  (This wasn't just a first-timer thing, because I heard other customers having the same experience.)  Food wise, I could have eaten here every day."}
{"text":"They are really the best of all the sushi burritos! I quite enjoyed the burrito bowl from them today. I will definitely be back to get some more."}
{"text":"This is my new goto lunch spot.  The bowls are amazing and you really can't go wrong."}
{"text":"We went twice in a week. Really fantastic, everything is delicious, especialyl the taro chips.Get the Unagi special before it's no longer a special."}
{"text":"Lunch was so great!! So glad your open now fir lunch!! Try the sashimi and appetizers.. amazing"}
{"text":"My first time trying sushi burrito and I'm glad I picked this place ! Super fresh and friendly service :)"}
{"text":"QUALITY. FRESH. FISH. I'm very loyal to Soho. 
Quantity+ Quality= happiness. 
Chef has mastered the sushi burrito."}
{"text":"I love this place! 

our food is always delicious, staff is very friendly and helpful when it comes to ordering.
you can customize your meal and they have lots of options. 

wish it wasn't quite as expensive but I guess it's to be expected with sushi."}
{"text":"Awesome concept. Soho SCREAMS to be franchised. Its creative, clean and really really good. Generous portions of very fresh ingredients. Great modern combos along with traditional tastes. Long line but efficient. 3 amigos ROCKS"}
{"text":"Wow! This place is amazing!! 

Drove 30min, and when I walked in, the line was almost out the door. These people are so efficient that the line moved really quick. It took about 10min to get my food after waking in the door.

I ordered the sunny salmon as a bowl with brown rice. It was very fresh tasting with the salmon and crab mix. I could have done without the cream cheese, so next time I'll customize it.

I also got a fire cracker with seaweed paper and sushi rice burrito. So freakin delicious!! Definitely getting one again.

I also ordered a Santa Fe (because I wanted to try a lot). I did a burrito with soy paper. The cheese sauce looks like nacho cheese sauce, but tastes like a creamy cheese. The chicken was very moist and as a whole it was a sweet/spicy mix. 

Overall, this is worth the drive and the wait."}
{"text":"What a cool idea. Sushi in a burrito. I had the Angry Tuna and the 3 Amigos. Both were soooo good. You can switch up what you want on it as well. This place is legit. Sushi was fresh."}
{"text":"I was surprised how busy the place was but I guess that's a good sign. Had no idea what to get being from out of town and a first timer. I got the firecracker, I don't know if it was because I was super hungry or it was just that delicious but I left full and happy. I would go again next time I'm in town. 

It seemed kind of loud inside but it could have just been my hangover."}
{"text":"Food is fine. Based upon the owner's video and the sombreros on the wall I expected more fusion and creativity.  Which is to say, our expectations didn't match what we were offered, but the food was fine for what it was. 

Do you want your sushi in a couple of small rolls or a giant roll? How about steak wrapped in seaweed? 

Place isn't that old, so I look forward to seeing how they grow"}
{"text":"Chef John can do no wrong. Top quality fish, exceptional prices, huge servings of food. Will always support everything that chef John puts out."}
{"text":"Kind of a long wait and not very much seating...but well worth it...the twin dragon was amazing and melon soda was the icing on the cake."}
{"text":"Tried sushirrito for the first time and soho did not disappoint! It was so good that My fiancé and I had to order two more rolls for dinner."}
{"text":"I really do love the whole idea od sushi burritos, it is quite an amazing combo of two commonly consumed everyday foods. The Soho burritos that caught my tastebuds attention were the 3 Amigos (3 different kinds of fish) and the Tripple S. It is a rather medium paced store ran with a decent amount of employees, so if you run in and see a line...(DON'T PANIC)"}
{"text":"I thought this place was great but not oh my god I need to come every day type of great. We came when the storefront was under construction and the name had recently changed. That meant the menus names had changed, but luckily I knew I wanted to get a bowl. I customized my bowl with sushi rice, salmon, soft shell crab and imitation crab. I also of course upgraded it to a combo just so I could try these delicious taro chips that everyone raved about. Which I admit, the taro chips were delicious with the nacho cheese sauce which I'm a sucker for. I liked that they had their own \"house soy sauce\" as I love salty sauces. The process was fairly easy, but I could definitely see how there could be a wait if it was during a rush. My bowl was ok. The rice was hard and was almost like it was last nights rice. The salmon was ok too and they charged me extra for sliced avocado since I didn't want the guacamole. I didn't feel like everything was overly amazing so I won't be making my way back purposely unless I'm in that neighborhood. It's a small place so if it's during a rush don't expect to get a table. 

3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Chef John has done it again. He is kicking ass and taking names. This establisment is barely a block away from his original Soho Sushi Restaurant. So you can eat here for lunch then run over there for dinner :)

I love how they expanded on the concept of sushi burritos to bowls. They listened to what the customers had to say and studied what they were ordering. They realized that they had an opportunity to grow their fan base so they capitalized and executed successfully.

I love that when you order the poke bowls, they mix everything into a bowl with the sauces, vegetables and protein before putting it back on the rice instead of just plopping each ingredient onto the rice right away. This gives a more thorough flavor for what they are trying to achieve with the pre-made menu or by building your own. They also brought over their burrito menu from the Sahara location so I can continue ordering my burritos double decker style ;)

They have also added grilled chicken, ginger beef chashu pork belly, grilled steak, grilled salmon and grilled shrimp to the menu if you want to skip the fish and try a teriyaki bowl instead. I don't know when I'll ever end up trying these since I love their fresh fish so damn much but one of these days I'll probably just order multiple items."}
{"text":"Please see previous review for Jaburrito.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/jaburritos-las-vegas-6?hrid=qpMIAxEJKc1j2A2Hp6inkw&utm_source=ashare&ref=yelp-android

I appreciate Chef John's idea to change the name to make better sense for the die hard fans from Soho. I like seeing the familiar faces as some of the workers are here during the day and at Soho at night. Along with changing the name, the decor matches the original restaurant and the prices of the burritos are a little cheaper as well. 

What's been blowing my mind is getting a double decker version of any burrito. Basically you're getting it wrapped in a tortilla, but lining it with melted cheese and tempura flakes to add a nice crunchy texture to every bite. It seems weird, but trust me, you will not regret it."}
{"text":"Delicious, I have tried the Twin Dragons in seaweed and the Three Amigos on a flour tortilla and both were great."}
{"text":"Shown is a make your own sushi burrito. Tried this place for the first time a few days ago and would go back."}
{"text":"Soooo good! So many options for the build your own burrito, and I have yet to have anything that was not amazing. This is my new favorite spot! And the jalapeño sour cream chips, you have t have those."}
{"text":"So good! They have a time of options for build your own, and enough crunch to make sure your burrito isn't just mush. Seriously good."}
{"text":"Affordable food and close to my work place. It's a place where you can get a quick lunch if you're in a hurry. You can customized your sushi burrito or bowl however you like. The chipotle sauce are the bomb."}
{"text":"Soho is my favorite Poke bowl in Las Vegas! It's always fresh, consistent and the servings are generous!"}
{"text":"Amazeballs!! My friend and I ordered two burritos to share. Started with the twin dragon and orders it as is. Can't go wrong with spicy tuna and shrimp tempura, plus the sauce inside is delicious. We also did a make it our own with ahi tuna, veggies, seaweed, and had it on the soy paper. My favorite part was the Taro chips, it comes with a cheese sauce but the chips are flavored so well you don't need it. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I ordered the 3 amigos, which has Ahi Tuna, Yellowtail, Salmon, Cucumber, Red Onion, Cilantro, Masago, Crispy Wonton Strips, and Wasabi Aioli, but I substituted spicy tuna (I like a little kick) for the Ahi and I added avocado, and it was amazing! I also got the furikake taro chips w/ nacho cheese and they were delicious too...I just wish the serving of cheese was a little bit bigger."}
{"text":"Mmm, been wanting to check this place out, been checking out the menu for a while, now. Today, finally, yes, hubby (didn't seem interested, when I mentioned it to him, but said I \"didn't tell him it was like Chipotle\") got me takeout, the Fire Cracker burrito @ $5.25 (spicy tuna, cucumber, lettuce, cabbage, crispy wonton strips, honey habanero sauce, sweet chipotle mayo) on seaweed paper. I am savoring this yummy meal. I admit it, sometimes, I eat fast. Not now, it's too good, so I'm trying to make it last. I succeeded. It was amazing. 

I love the concept of fusion food (Braddah's---sad face, we'll miss that place, the food truck Truknyaki is the bomb, but a bit elusive) but few live up to the hype and excitement (Komex was good, but...). Not the case with this joint. I love sushi but I this was the first time I ever had a sushi burrito and it was a yummy experience (if I get a burrito at traditional mexican restaurants, I don't usually finish it, 'cause it's too big of a meal for me). I feel satisfied but my belly doesn't feel like it's full of bricks. (No likey.)

I am Pinay so I do love my food medium spicy, especially nowadays, because of my restricted diet (low sodium) monday through friday. My lips were tingling but that is exactly the way I like it. Spicy tuna is also one of my favorites, which was tasty. All the ingredients seem to compliment each other very well. It was all exactly in the right proportion too. Listen, there was nothing I disliked about this sushi burrito. It was perfection. I would get it again.

I would like to try some of the other items on the menu or maybe even create my own combo (build your own). Hubby wants to try it too. Like Chipotle, you choose between the burrito, bowl or nachos and select the proteins, sauce, fixings, etc. Also serves Vegetarian, Kids menu and sides (taro chips, edamame, miso soup, seaweed salad, & mochi ice cream)."}
{"text":"A look around social media will tell you one thing about this place: people are going nuts for this place. 

I went at 11am which was good because I just barely beat the line that starts stretching past the door on most days (so I heard). 

The staff were friendly and helpful with making a selection. On this day, I did observe some confusion about what was actually in some of the burritos, so it was not the fastest line I have ever seen. 

Here is the thing: to me, sushi burritos are kind of just very large handrolls. I can see the novelty and it is cool that you can customize it. But I am really not the hugest fan. I love sushi and I love burritos and maybe I choose too \"safe\" of a sushi burrito but I did not see what the big woop is about. My spicy tuna was not as fresh as I normally like it to be. For the price and the amount that you receive, it definitely has value. I did enjoy my taro chips although the cheese sauce reminds me of Taco Bell nacho cheese sauce, which is quite low on my list of cheeses that I ever want to consume."}
{"text":"I was super stoked about trying my first sushi burrito. I thought to myself, \"COOL, I can get my sushi craving figure out for $10, and this is genius!\" 
I figured it would taste like a giant roll or something like that. And maybe let me just chill out on my sushi craving for a while. 

The two items I ordered (view pictures) were good, but it was no substitute for a roll or sushi for me. Silly me...kinda kicked myself in the butt for my skewed expectations after-the-fact. I think had I had no expectations of that sort, I would've had a different experience. But, my dining patron agreed, so I'm not too crazy after all. 

I liked the taro chips very much...still don't understand how that got paired with melted nacho cheese sauce, and I for sure skipped it. I say, give it a shot. I will be back with renewed expectations. One day. I'm just a tad bit heart-broken from it."}
{"text":"Um... How much?! The first thing on their menu is the Twin Dragon roll at $11. That's half the price of all you can eat sushi... for a roll that is no where near half as filling. If you've had Sushiritto in San Francisco, you're in for a disappointment. The rolls are more expensive, smaller and definitely not as good. 
The place was packed, the line was about 10 minutes long when I went in on Saturday night. The kids working behind the counter were working hard so I have no complaints there. However, the smell of raw fish was way too strong for me to comfortably sit and eat there. I had to take it to go- also it was unbearably hot inside. Hot temps and the smell of raw fish? Not my scene. It's in the plaza with Landry's Seafood, David's Bridal and Mcdonalds across from Palace Station. 

Will the crowds stay once the novelty wears off? We'll see."}
{"text":"I still think jaborrito was much better , the food  quality is not the same , sorry just my opinion there are more options on the menu."}
{"text":"Didn't live up to the hype, unfortunately. I've had too much sushi in my day and this is in my lowest 5. Sushi Kaya being just above it. Angry tuna sounds good but is not. Onions were overpowering and the sauce was similar to teriyaki so it didn't blow me a way like I thought. The concept is original but not something I would go to everyday. It is ridiculously expensive for a burrito and a drink ($12) Thats half of AYCE in most places, if not more during AYCE lunch specials! I wouldn't try it honestly. Both your wallet and stomach will be empty by the end of your visit."}
{"text":"I LOVE SUSHI BURRITOS.

Want your sushi fix without breaking the bank with  sushi restaurant prices? look no further!

Soho sushi burrito is a fast and casual restaurant with indoor seating available.

They offer wraps with seaweed, soy paper, flour or wheat tortilla. 

Bowl options if you don't want the carbs. 

Rice, brown rice, quinoa

Now offering poke bowls as well. 

Order from their preset menu options or build your own as well. 

Their menu has classic sushi style rolls in addition to fusion rolls with Mexican add ons like guacamole, jalapeño, red onion. 

I hands down prefer soho compared to jaburrito and will make the drive to this location if I am craving a sushi burrito."}
{"text":"This place is sooo good! You get to build your own sushi burrito or salad. I prefer the sushi-burrito over the salad. Salads are not bad unless you want to eat healthier. The Taro chips with cheese are a must try. They're also vegan friendly!"}
{"text":"We were craving sushi and love trying new fusion foods, so we found Soho right around the corner from work. I was a little skeptical, but it was SO GOOD. Got the 3amigos and the Sunny Salmon. Both were delicious, but the Sunny Salmon was a better first-time burrito. 3amigos is good for wasabi lovers! Definitely want to come back!"}
{"text":"Formerly Jaburrito, I spoke with one of the clerks who said that the owner is actually the same owner of Soho on 215, and wanted to unify the soho name in Las Vegas. This is what prompted the name change but the most suspicious thing to me is why change all of the names of the signature burritos? Nonetheless the burritos are the same but some of the signature items are a dollar or two cheaper 

If you like their facebook or instagram page you get a free salmon nigiri pen !

Setting: Right off W. Sahara after rancho. It's in the mcdonald's parking lot. Pretty big parking lot so you should be able to find a spot. 

Interior: Bright but really not a lot of places to sit especially with how popular it is, so have someone claim a spot and get their order while you're in line if you wanna be those people lol.

Food: It's everything you'd want in a sushi burrito (minus unagi). Loads of options to add to your burritos so take advantage of it. 

Service: Friendly and willing to explain how their menu works. Previously half of my burrito fell on the floor but they did not hesitate to bring me a new whole burrito :)

Drinks: They have water cups but they're the kind you get from the dentist's office, so don't let your water sit in that cup for too long. I opted for their apple soda which had an unusual aftertaste, so I'd go for the melon soda instead.

Overall: 30 minutes away from my house and yet it's quite worth the drive. Soho burrito has staked it's claim as Las Vegas's first official sushi burrito restaurant and it's here to stay."}
{"text":"This place is amazing... Please, don't be intimidated \"Sushi Burritos\", WTH??? I'm in love with the Firecracker bowl with mixed greens instead of rice, delixxx.

No lines when we go there but as it was our turn, the line was almost near the door. Will definitely come here again when im in vegas!! Bomb suff!!"}
{"text":"I was in the area and I yelped what was near the basketball tournament we were at and what do you know Soho was just around the corner.  It was easy to find in a little strip mall.  Parking was plentiful.  In fact, we were able to find parking right in front of the Subway that was right next door. 

In addition to finding this place close by, I was able to view the menu online AND I was able to order online.  I paid online too.  I ordered exactly what I wanted, how I wanted it.  It was great.  I ordered a sushi'rito bowl.  I practically ordered whatever fish they had on the menu, like salmon, tuna, yellowtail, unagi and crab. You can choose whatever protein you want and whatever rice you want.  You get so many options.  I think my eyes got really big when I kept clicking on the items. I ordered all kinds of toppings also.  My bowl was huge.  I was extremely full after eating my meal.  It doesn't sound filling but it definitely is.  After all, this was my lunch and I was still full as dinner passed by.  My only gripe is that of course, after your eyes are big and your stomach is hungry and you went click happy on all the options, everything has a steep price.  I didn't end up spending a lot because I was out of town and I wanted to try everything in one sweep.  Yes, this did cost me quite a bit more had I just gone with a traditional option. Just be aware of that if you choose the build your own option. Be mindful of your wallet not only your craving.

The service was friendly and they treated you more than just a customer.  If you didn't know what to order they were more than willing to help you out and give you suggestions based on whatever you were craving at the time.  They have specialty items available too if you don't want to make your own. This is helpful for those of us whom can't make a decision.  

If in the area, I would totally come back."}
{"text":"Formerly Jaburrito, Soho SushiBurrito offers the same menu items as the first restaurant. I love the concept of a huge sushi roll! They're also customizable, even better! You pick what you wrap the servings in, what add-on and protein to add, as well as sauce. You make your big ass sushi roll (sushi burrito) what ever way you want. Why not have an alternative way to enjoy a favorite, sushi!
I had the sushi bowl during my last visit. It was delicious (of course because I made it) and super filling. I was full half way through but could not stop eating it, sooo good!
They also have taro chips, pretty good."}
{"text":"I made a custom burrito of my own. Finally lost my sushi burrito virginity. I liked the burrito that I custom picked. Got it with salmon, masago, avocado, cucumber, mixed greens, chipotle mayo, unagi sauce and wonton strips. The wonton strips gave my burrito a crunch I liked! Delicious. I finished the whole burrito. Probably prefer the sushi burrito over a bowl? I'll have to try their bowl there next time."}
{"text":"We use to go here all the time and they use to give big potions and that's one of the reasons why we liked it here.  We asked to put something extra because proior to that they use to put a bit more, but they said things change.  Theres no consistentsy.  This place is unprofessional.  I will never come here again.

{"text":"I'm not sure what the hype is with sushi burritos. Convenience factor I guess? I saw lots of folks come and go so it's a pretty quick place to eat.

It is \"Chipotle style\" where you go through a line and pick what you want in your burrito. After looking at their website and seeing GF sauces, I brought my friend who is celiac. 

Well, the workers there weren't very allergen-friendly. Took multiple tries to get them to understand what gluten and soy are. They were not able to accommodate switching gloves and wiping down the work area either. 

It wasn't until we got to the cashier that she took out a binder that had allergen info. 

The allergen stuff was for my friend, while I could eat it safely. I got the salmon with sushi rice. It was pretty run of the mill, something I could make at home I felt. The burrito/roll machine was pretty neat though."}
{"text":"We usually visit once or twice a month for a quick sushi fix. The service is okay. It could be better and it could always be worse! The employees do tend to carry on personal conversations. The burritos are good. We've tried all of the seafood ones. They do seems to fall apart which is an annoyance. 

I'm not sure if it's just me, but the spicy tuna has been so salty! The last two times I've had a hard time eating the twin dragon bc of the salt. I don't know if they make it in house or our buying it elsewhere. But, that would be the only thing stopping me from eating there again."}
{"text":"Very glad they replaced Metro Pizza with Soho. Every time I pass by, I see a line for bowls and burritos. Their lines are long for a reason- the food is good and different from the other options offered in UNLV's Student Union. They have premade rolls and bowls for quick ordering, or you can make your own bowl/burrito. The price depends on what protein you get. Spicy salmon, tomago, tofu, & krab are around $5.50. Specialty toppings like seaweed salad, masago, & guac are an extr $0.50. Bowls are large and well worth the price. I should mention that the bowls are compostable!!!! :-) 
The young employees are more than pleasant to interact with! Best service you'll find in the SU."}
{"text":"I did an online order.  When I got it to work it was missing avocado, peppers, tomatoes, spinach and cream cheese.

Major fail"}
{"text":"SO GOOD! I was visiting from out of town and we stopped here for lunch. The place is rather small (only about 4-5 tables for 4 people each) but you can get your food to go also. They have a ton of options which is awesome! Sushi burritos, bowls (custom and signature) options galore!

I ordered the Lion King sushi burrito and it was soooo good. I got the soy paper on the outside and I couldn't even taste it (which is exactly what I wanted!). There was a seaweed wrap option also. All of the ingredients tasted so fresh!

They have an assortment of sides to choose from also: edamame, soup, etc. as well as fountain and bottled drinks. For such a small place, the food and drink selection was incredible!

They also offer a discount for employees of certain companies so be sure to ask if you're on the list!

I will definitely be back when I'm in town again. This was such a great, fresh find!!"}
{"text":"2 words: I'm addicted.  Soho Sushi Burrito has become one of my new favorite restaurants.  I love the set-up.  If you haven't been there before, it's like Chipotle for sushi burritos.  You can make your own, where they have an extensive menu where you can have \"whatever you liiiike\" (in the voice of T.I.).  They offer brown rice!  They offer various protein options for the non-raw sushi eaters!  And you can't go wrong with picking any of their specially made sauces like wasabi aioli and chipotle mayo?!  With the ENDLESS possibilities, I was hooked. 

Although I like the idea of creating the most amazing sushi burrito, I find myself ordering off their tried and true masterpieces.  If you ate there before the name change, you might notice the menu is different.  Don't be alarmed, the sushi burritos got a bit of a name change too.  The staff informed me that the Redondo is now the 3 Amigos and the Rockport is now Triple S.  So if you're looking for any of the old stuff, they can still make it for you!  One of the staff, Princess, recommended the Lion King, which was also very good, and comes with grilled salmon for those who don't like sushi.  

They also offer free condiments near the register.  Their house made soy sauce is thicker than normal, but it definitely helped kick the food up a notch.  They also offer salsa and wasabi.

Wait time isn't too bad, despite the long lines.  I think the max I had to wait was 15 minutes, but it goes by quick.  I also like how they have a machine that evenly distributes the rice onto the seaweed/soy paper.  I also came in to order 5 sushi burritos, and the staff was fast, friendly, and efficient.  The average sushi burrito is about $10, which I think is justifiable.  It's big enough to be considered a meal and offers quality that you can taste. 

My only gripe is that there isn't enough seating since it's always packed!  I've taken it to-go every time that I've gone.  But other than that, Soho Sushi Burritos is great!"}
{"text":"A spinoff from their full service & quick order at the counter establishments, this location is off the beaten path that serves Poke & Sushi customizations to its finest. First time here & they just happened to open up a few months or was it weeks? - ago. Very casual ambience, yet sleek and classy in its simple abode. Friendly workers that has smiles on their faces as first timers like me & my homies browsed their menu that's posted on the board. I opted to build my own sushi burrito by combining 2 scoops of Grilled Chicken Breast strips & a scoop of Surimi Crab. Weird combination, huh? Then chose seaweed paper & brown rice for the \"tortilla\" part. Hence, they also have poke bowls if you're into that! Then I was asked for which ingredients, sauces & toppings to be put in the sushi burrito. Opted for a lot of veggies to pack a healthy punch - including seaweed, avocado, lettuce, green & red onions, a tiny scoop of pico de gallo, with a mixture of both Spicy Miso Aioli & Sesase Soy sauce dressings! It may be weird, but in order for you to try it, you gotta be creative AND experiment! First bite into the sushiritto was heaven! No regrets in combining chicken & crab, and it had A LOT of veggies, which is a huge plus! My other friends got a Teriyaki Bowl & a Lion King Roll. Total Bill came to about $25 & it's VERY reasonably priced! Glad this place popped up in Las Vegas for those foodies & adventurers wanting to explore the Vegas palate! Highly recommended if you drive or rent a car in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Japanese chipotle.
Great place for lunch. You can create you own dish or choose something that's been created. by Soho."}
{"text":"This place was so delicious and service was so fast! i can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"Yay! I'm a fan.

After seeing my friends in SD, LA, and SF post their sushi-burritos, I am happy to have experienced a similar indulgence here in Las Vegas.

Came on Saturday around 1:40pm and the line was close to the door. It was about 2:15 when I reached the front. The concept is similar to Chipotle except you can either pick a menu combo or create your own (price is a la carte). I had the 3Amigos on seaweed with sushi rice which was delicious. If you're not a fan of wasabi, like me, the aioli surprisingly adds a nice underlying and vague taste which enhanced the burrito. Best part are the little crunchies! It was definitely filling without making you feel full. 

I recommend expecting to take your food to go. There are about 20 seats in the place as it isn't very big. Parking might be tough as well. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Serious NOMS here! We all need Sushi Burritos in our life.
The reviews don't lie. I am writing this for my followers who have yet to experience this newest why-didn't-someone-think-of-this-sooner sensation.
They even have a special machine that cranks out a fused sheet of rice onto your choice of wrapper...very cool!
It's like the Chipotle of sushi & burritos. Custom make your own or get one of their signature burritos.
A tip for custom orders: type out your selections in a list on your phone so you can rattle off the items without forgetting & holding up the line :)
There are so many times I'd love to get sushi for lunch but don't have time to sit at a proper sushi bar so this is the answer to my lunchtime prayers.
Include an order of taro chips with your meal.

Now I just need more locations to open up. Hey Soho, I think your Yelpers will come out in droves to support any/all new locations!

{"text":"Great creative burritos. Worth trying.  I will be returning and passing the word along.  Try the twin dragon.  Very clean establishment."}
{"text":"That 1 burrito is way more than enough for getting my husband & I stuffed.   Love their food"}
{"text":"Delicious food and good for you, made by an ingeniously fast system of putting perfect rice squares on your wrap material of choice. It's set up like Chipotle or Subway, in that they move your wrap along the counter as they add successive ingredients.
Absolutely delectable flavors, but $10 for what's basically a large sushi roll is a bit much."}
{"text":"Soho is next to our office and as a sushi addict, anything with decent raw fish within a 5 mile radius will be a regular spot for me. 

My usual is the 3 amigos (combo of tuna, yellow fish, and salmon) either in a burrito or a bowl. If you're looking to cut some calories, go with the brown rice. If you love wasabi like me, a little bar on the side exists so you can grab some. 

Overall, it's a quick little chain spot where you can grab what you want quickly and head out."}
{"text":"Had this place a few times now. I always get the burritos and my GF always gets the bowls. They're amazing every time and the ingredients are always fresh. Try the 3 amigos!"}
{"text":"I thought that I'd try this place out since I usually eat a panda bowl from Panda Express. I got in line and I asked, \"what does the chicken teriyaki bowl come with?\". The guy responds, \"chicken with teriyaki sauce\". Like.... no duh.... So I said \"It doesn't come with rice?\" and he said \"yes it does\" so I said \"can I get vegetables instead?\"  he said \"yes or brown rice\". So I told him I wanted brown rice with vegetables. He gives me half brown rice and half leaves! I was hoping for like steamed veggies such as broccoli and cauliflower, but I got a salad. But whatever, at least I got some greens. Then my bowl is handed to the girl who puts on the sauce. And I am not sure if this is just me, but I do not like my rice drenched in sauce. That is exactly what she did. I sat down with my food tried to eat it but I could not because i was just basically drinking teriyaki sauce and it was disgusting. I was eating leaves dripping in teriyaki sauce with rice that is soaked in teriyaki. In the end I wasted $7 because it was so bad I just threw it away. Long story short, I'll be sticking with Panda Express."}
{"text":"A friggin burrito and sushi baby?! WTF is this awesomeness! I got the firecracker and it was worth way more than what I paid for it but I am not complaining at all. I WILL be coming back again ASAP!"}
{"text":"Amazing staff, friendly and helpfull.
Food is on point, the portions make sense they don't put too much rice. Every ingredient is well seperated.
They do delivery too !
Love it !"}
{"text":"Fusing the ingredients of Sushi in a burrito is as ingenious as it gets. There is no doubt that people have admired this novel concept... look at their ratings and if still in doubt, show up at 11AM - when the store opens - to see how quickly it gets crowded. Can't wait for this business to hand out franchises so that other cities can enjoy the fantastic fusion food as well. And when that happens, places like Subway will have a real run for their money. 

One friendly piece of advice to the management: have a staff advisor available for consultation before the ordering station to help with figuring out suitable options (there are so many!). Information on the board is helpful, but the board does not answer questions. And by the time a server behind the stall attempts to answer any question (and trust me, you will have quite a few), there is already a huge pressure to choose something quickly because the line of hungry folks behind is too long. So, some advise and answered questions well in advance of ordering will be helpful."}
{"text":"The line was out the door for lunch. Waited 20 minutes and ordered the  Twin Dragonn which was on point. Great concept."}
{"text":"What a friggin concept!! Who woulda thought you could make a burrito out of sushi!! They sort of have a set up like a chipotle or Qdoba they way you order your food.  I ordered the three amigos which had yellowtail, tuna, and salmon with onions, a wasabi aoli . I added some seaweed and chipotle mayo. It was a  in a my mouth! I also ordered some taro chips with a cheese sauce to dip them in. Wow it was different but it was soooo flavorful. There was a line almost out the door the entire time. The cool thing about this restaurant is its off the strip and off the beaten path. Definitely a memorable food experience. When I come home from now on I'll look forward to coming here instead of In-n-Out!"}
{"text":"I've been to Sushiritto in SF before and was skeptical on going to Jaburritos (previous name). However, this place is awesome. The restaurant is very clean, the company uses a lot of cool recyclable items, and offers a variety of sushi burritos. I love having the Twin Dragon and looking to try the other burritos sometime. 

While the name has changed, the service is still great and the burritos still taste the same. In comparison to Sushirrito's prices and size, they are practically the same and well worth the money. I always get full from just eating a sushi burrito. Also, if you love mochi, well they have mochi! 

Overall this place is great and I recommend eating here if you're ever in Vegas and craving a sushi burrito."}
{"text":"There burrito is the best in Vegas, trust me they have egg omelette that other places don't have! Go try it they won't let you feel disappointed"}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place as soon as it opened. It's delicious!  Went in to  pick up 4 burritos to go for my coworkers. Greeted with a smile and fast service. I highly recommend the 3 amigos, crunchy with a tasty amount of fish. Make sure you watch when they make the burrito, the nice young man accidentally put in the wrong thing in one I'd the burritos, but still 5 stars :) 
Oh taro chips are amazing too!"}
{"text":"Very excited this place is finally opened. Was here last week and saw it wasn't opened yet. So I came back this week and there was a pretty long line during lunch. So that was a good sign. 

I have heard of sushi burritos in California, I guess it is a very popular food truck. I was skeptical but all my friends say it's so good and to find out there is one Vegas I had to try it. 

I had the high maintenance burrito, which had yellowtail and spicy tuna. I absolutely love yellowtail and this one caught my eye. The only thing is I had to ask for no masago, I just can't get past the texture.  

Ok so I definitely understand the craze about these things. They are delicious!! The fish is very fresh and I was surprised and I thought to myself should I get more sauce? But it actually was very good. The creamy cilantro sauce was really good but I do want to try something spicier next time. I also got a side of their taro chips with cheese. The cheese was good but honestly these chips don't need them. They have this salty sweet seasoning to them that make them so addicting like I needed a bigger bag! I killed them! 

So I went with their preselected menu for the burrito but I will for sure create my own next time. I saw they had bowls too but the burrito is pretty filling.  

The seating is limited but it's a small place , I don't think they could fit anymore tables or chairs. The staff was fast and they were informative. 

Will be back soon..."}
{"text":"They charge you 50 cents for everything! Fish eggs, avocado, salmon, etc Jesus Christ! The whole algorithm makes no sense and the food has ZERO FLAVOR!!"}
{"text":"I was going to take off one star because it is always crazy busy whenever I go, but I figure that's not really the business's fault that they're so popular, and if a place always has ridiculous lines, it's either because it's ridiculously good, or ridiculously slow with their service.

I'm glad to report it is because they are ridiculously good. As in, I drive from the other side of town just to get one of these babies.

Super friendly service, great food. Just be aware that there aren't that many tables so it's better to do take out than dine in. Or go in at odd times."}
{"text":"I have to admit I was a bit dubious when a friend recommended we come here. But I ended up being pleasantly surprised by the concept. I got the Sunny Salmon with seaweed paper and sushi rice. The fish was super fresh and they combine Mexican ingredients perfectly with Japanese. It's definitely worth trying it out."}
{"text":"Yup. Absolutely a 5/5 for my first sushiburrito experience. (Especially since I immediately tried another place that just wasn't as awesome.) 

Again, I'm still getting used to the whole raw fish thing. So I was happy to see three different menu options that included meat.  I went with the steak and eggs. It also had cream cheese, delicious sauces, spinach and crunchy bits. As well as a side of cheese sauce for dipping just because I wanted to try it. Good decisions all around. I'd absolutely do the same again. 

Hubby can't even remember what he got. He simply asked for what was most popular. What it was, I actually loved it. Raw fish and all. I'm pretty sure it was something with crab and tuna. 

We also ordered side of cheese toro chips and picked up a can of Guava juice. They chips are your  basic toro chips with a seasoning that makes them taste like Doritos, which I think is fantastic!"}
{"text":"delish!!  Totally an awesome food experience. Two suggestions: It's WAY TOO LOUD...turn down the music. Also, provide soy sauce in to-go packets. Otherwise this place is perfect. It's not far from my job so I come with coworkers often. Love it!!"}
{"text":"Had the twin dragon and it was amazing!! Will diffenatly be going back. Loved this place it was clean and the staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying this place is worth the wait! My coworkers and I came here for lunch on a Friday and this place gets packed fast! The like was out the door but we decided to stay either way. Overall the line took about 25-30 mins but the food was so good that I didn't mind.

I had the twin dragons on seaweed paper, so good! The mixes of the sauces with the spicy tuna and crispy wontons was on point. I can't wait to get back here and try something else!"}
{"text":"There's a reason why this place is always packed. Because it's so good and worth the wait! Their quality of sushi is perfect, and the low price for your own specialize sushi burrito is amazing! Always go here at least once a month."}
{"text":"Love love sushi and i so so so love this place when i found out they made burritos outta sushi i was like whaaaa i gotta check this out lol i did and i loved it"}
{"text":"I usually don't give these \"fast food\" type places 5 stars but again it comes down to service. Even though the people working have a Chipotle style of job, they still smile and they still are friendly and also are generous on portions. 

If you like sushi, sashimi, and burritos why have you not tried this yet? I wish they had this kind of place everywhere so I could eat this every week. It satisfies the sushi craving and is not excessively expensive. 

Go try this stuff out."}
{"text":"Tuesday at 2 o'clock was so nice & quiet I actually got to eat there..back on Friday & it was super busy..lunch hour. 
Had their twin dragon bowl..soo good. I think that the bowls are much better than the rolls ..choice or white or brown rice..Delicio!!!"}
{"text":"This spot is located in a strip mall across from the Palace Station on W Sahara. The entire front side of the strip mall is under construction and it was not easy finding a parking spot at lunch time. There was about a 15 minute wait in line. The dining area is small, so you may be taking your order to-go if it is busy.

We ordered the Angry Tuna, Twin Dragon, and the 3 Amigos. We all chose the seaweed wrapper. Everything was excellent. They were all basically giant hand rolls filled with different items. Most of the rolls are around $8 to $10 dollars. Definitely worth it.

I will be returning to try more menu items. I recommend that you give this place a try. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Fish is fresh, toppings are crisp  and fresh too!!  It's a lot of stuff for 10 bucks!!  Plus the staff is always super accommodating to my little quirks!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time having a sushi burrito and I tried the Twin Dragon. So good!! I loved it and this was after eating it 3 hours later once I got home."}
{"text":"Holy crap! This place was amazing!!! I decided to make my own bowl and it came out great thanks to them for helping me choose the right sauce to go with what I got. The only negative I can say is there miso soup is a little expensive for the amount that you get. If they made it a bigger bowl or made it cheaper I have been happier. Pick one please guys pick one and I'll drink more of it !!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent place! Bright and cheerful staff, clean restauraunt, and delicious food! The food quality is excellent and the portionsizes are hefty. They give you a great serving of protein (fish) in your burrito/bowl. I highly recommend this place for a great meal anytime of the day! They also have happy hour everyday, $3 beers."}
{"text":"Almost exactly like the other location \"Soho Sushi Burrito\" sushiburrito-wise, except this one adds more focus to their bowls, which I'm a bigger fan of! The staff here is no different - quick and courteous. The girl that made my bowl still referred to the recipe, but she put the ingredients together very quickly. She reminds me of Jessica Sanchez...

Anyway, I ordered the Hilo Poke Bowl with white rice, since it sounded like it came with basic, traditional toppings. If you're like me and don't care for crazy toppings, you will enjoy the Hilo poke bowl. It's made with yellowtail, green onions, red onion, black pepper, sesame soy sauce, and mixed seaweed (unique blend... I think I saw ogo in there). I didn't add anything else, and it doesn't need anything else!

They don't skimp out on the amount of fish, although they are cut into much smaller pieces, which you may or may not like. Personally, I like bigger pieces since you get more of the fish flavor and texture, but smaller pieces also mean they won't easily fall out of your sushi burrito.

I will definitely come back here, especially since it's a couple of blocks from home."}
{"text":"This place is a dream come true for sushi lovers on the go.   It's set up like a Chipotle, where you pick a burrito or bowl, pick your protein and then add your sides.  I've tried both the burrito and the bowl.  The fish was good but they were a little skimpy on the soft shelled crab.  The ponzu sauce is really good, make sure to ask for that opposed the soy sauce. 

Even with my 4 star rating (because of the skimpy soft shelled crab serving), I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"I could eat here everyday of my life!  The food is always delicious!  My work loves to order here as often as possible! Very impressed! Wish there were more locations!"}
{"text":"It was like nothing I ever imagined yet it so was. (If that makes sense to anybody.)
My FIRE CRACKER salad with brown rice and seaweed salad was amazing.
The spicy was just right; not too over bearing or uneatable just perfect!
Going back for lunch today!"}
{"text":"Although the lines tend to get long here, their sushi burritos are worth the wait! I loved the Twin Dragon with soy paper. That's probably my favorite! It's like eating a giant sushi roll without chopsticks... Actually, yeah that's exactly what this is ;) awesome place!"}
{"text":"This is a great way to save money when you are craving sushi. The fish is all very fresh and delicious. Sushi burritos are a great idea, and this fast casual establishment does a great job at exciting that idea."}
{"text":"This place is so good!  For the price & what your putting into it, really worth it.  When I go to Vegas & I wanna eat outside of the hotel, I'd prob go here for lunch or a snack.  If your a big Sushi or Poki fan, this is a must try.  Everything here tastes fresh & clean.  So many different choices & combinations with sauce &/or toppings that I wanna try.  Price isn't bad too.  The California Sushiritto is prob my favorite.  Thinking & writing about this is making me crave it..."}
{"text":"This location feels isolated for some reason but it's just off of the 215 & jones. I've never been to this complex, maybe that's why. They have multiple locations & I asked the workers if there was a difference between this new location & the other ones & one of them said that this place has teriyaki bowls. 

I arrived at around 5 something in the afternoon. The place was dead. There 3 workers, who were on point with greeting us. The girl who took my order was a delight. She had a big smile smile on her face the entire time. 

I ordered a twin dragon. She asked if I wanted soy paper or seaweed & I ordered soy. I personally would like it more if they asked if we want white or brown rice cos she started making the burrito as soon as I said it & felt bad she had to change out the soy paper cos she already put white rice on it. Sorry! But anyways, the sushiritto itself was good. There was something a little sour in it?? Which kinda turned me off. Idk what it was but kept eating anyway LOL. The original taro chips are my absolute favorite!!"}
{"text":"I loved this place!! My first sushi burrito experience and it met my expectations. I had the triple s and it was extremely tasty. I give four stars because my sister had the bowl which wasn't very tasty and the tempura shrimp went fresh, but then again, it's a sushi place, not a cooked bowl place. 

I will def go here again anytime I'm in the area for a quick lunch. Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"To give you an idea of how much I like this we walked here from the middle of strip.  That is about a 3 to 3.5 mile walk each way.

This is the best fusion I have seen in the fast casual space for Asian and Mexican.  I really try to make it fusion with making sure that I have pieces that are distinctly one versus the other.

Wife got to enjoy this place with me this time and she was just as big of a fan.  We both made our own burrito.  The fish tastes fresh, no issues with quality on that front.  There are lots of options for fillings and for sauces.  All the ones we have tried have been good.

The taro chips with cheese sauce was also good.  I would recommend staying with the original flavor for the chips as the other ones seem to have a little too much powdered seasoning.

Only complaint is that there isn't one of these back where I live!"}
{"text":"So this was my first time having a sushi burrito and all I can say is that I was speechless after finishing it! I can't believe I have been missing out on this kind of deliciousness my whole life! I would come back here a million more times and recommend everyone to try this place!"}
{"text":"Awesome fresh and feels healthy! Hahah.. We had the twin dragon, sunny salmon and angry tuna burritos wrapped in seaweed. Hope to see this place make it west to Southern California..."}
{"text":"Orders the triple dragon an it was all good. It was just like one big sushi roll.  Will have to definitely come back and try their other items. Will make this one of my go to spots when I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review as I'm sitting here after I finished my Twin Dragon Sushi Burrito. People no joke this is the best sushi burrito I ever had. And the beer is fresh and cold, soooooo good!!! Definitely I'm coming here again...tomorrow :)))"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try out this new food trend, and definitely a must try for the first time. Pretty much a handroll level 9000...if you think about it its like 2sushi rolls shoved in a burrito form, so value wise great if you want sushi on a budget. Definitely filled me up. Friendly staff and clean atmosphere."}
{"text":"Friendly and welcoming staff, and their sushi burrito is the bomb most especially the one that has cream cheese in it (I forgot what it's called. Sorry) This is my go-to place everytime I'm craving for sushi."}
{"text":"I just discovered this place thanks to the Las Vegas Weekly. This place is bomb! It's like sushi meets Chipotle! So good. I like 3 Amigos personally but everything is good. Went three times this week! Why am I moving to California again? I'm staying Vegas now."}
{"text":"Awesome! Food, employees, & cleanliness of restaurant are all top notch! Loved the burrito the first time, and have been back 2 more times in the last two weeks! The jalapeño sour cream taro chips are also bomb! Wasted my money trying another place, but won't make that mistake again! There's a reason they say, Soooho good! because it really is! Thanks Soho!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice this week lol! I'm hooked on triple dragon. 
The place is small and not ideal for large groups but its very clean, the staff is welcoming and will give you an explanation of the menu if needed."}
{"text":"GOOD 

I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
It's getting hotter, It's a burning love
And I just can't seem to get enough of..SOHO =)

I'm told, originators of the sushi burrito concept...and damn happy they are.  I've been coming here for a few years now. yes, even through the upgrades at mall... I think for the most part they consistently keep the same staple menu items/favorites like the firecracker, twin dragon, triple s ,etc...if not.. you can make your own from scratch.

I do like that they have a flour/wheat tortilla option available for us fatty's =)  YESSS... a must...makes me feel i'm getting my $'s worth for my belly. 

Staff is always helpful and let you take your time so that they can get it right...the ingredients are always in stock...unlike other place.  I'm not sure why SOHO is always just a bit better than the competitors..it's like they are always on point with ingredients...

 \"It's all about the texture and having enough...otherwise it's a mushy mess\"

Kudos to you SOHO team for a five star review after years of coming to you on Sahara and 1-15!! 

BAD

Why you gotta hate...whatcha got against the Summerlin (red rock) peeps...we are waiting for you...it's a gold mine out here!  I'm tired of sub-par sushi burritos from the competition..."}
{"text":"Why can't we have one of these in Phoenix? This is my favorite place to eat when in Las Vegas. They are very vegan friendly and the customer service is always outstanding. Usually when I eat at a place multiple times I can get a bit embarrassed because I feel like i am always there. But not here. This place is too good and I get as much of it as I can while I am in town. Whenever I am in town I am usually only in Vegas for a couple days. This last time I ate here four times in two days. If you are not vegan this place is also good. I always order the Vegan Lover bowl. If you are not sure what to order just talk to one of the workers and they will explain everything to you. This needs to be on your list of places to try."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since they first open. And they used to give a good serving size portion but I haven't been in a while and I came in today and I notice they don't give as much anymore. I went to the other location not too long ago and they gave a good size portion. I usually order the same thing so when I got 2 shrimp tempura instead of 4 like the other location I was kinda shock because if I'm paying the same amount I want the same amount of food. Only going to the other location."}
{"text":"EVERYTHING IS GOOD HERE!!!

I think I've tried about half of the signature burritos here. Today i tried the Steak and Egg and again, another home run. I had it on the flour tortilla. Normally I do soy paper but since my gf always gets the tortilla, I thought I'd keep it Mexican. 

Definitely go for the taro chips with a side of nacho cheese. Never a disappointment."}
{"text":"I know, I know! It's always a damn 5 star rating... But that's because I be eating that BOMB!!!

This place is super refreshing. My girl had the Twin Dragon on a flour tortilla and it was the perfect mix of Japanese and Mexican. Tons of crab, the right amount of heat from the spicy tuna, and some delicious veggies. 

I had the 3 amigos, and friends, I don't lie when I say \"FUUUUUU!\" Tuna, yellowtail and salmon were partying with a wasabi aioli and some veggies with rice. So. Damn. REFRESHING. this place is a must try, especially with 3$ Sapporos all day."}
{"text":"Whoa this was bad. I don't even know if there was any real substance in my tiny burrito.. fish please? All I tasted was the scoops of spicy tuna that reminds me of Subway's scoops of avocado. Really sad. Maybe it's just because I'm Asian lol"}
{"text":"Not a big reviewer, so all i'm going to say is bomb diggity"}
{"text":"Took me two visits to write a review here...most likely due to me entering a food coma after each visit. Food is great. Everything you love about sushi in a new form factor and very filling. Pre made menu is solid or get crazy and make your own. 

Will be back very often."}
{"text":"OMG I love this place I can eat it everyday. The double dragon is the best. Place is super clean and the workers are fast"}
{"text":"We go here at least 2 times a week...maybe 3..  great pice; fresh fish/veggies and always accommodating.  Great customers service.
Better than the other bowls/burrito places.  Big bonus because it's on my way home from work."}
{"text":"The food is great and fresh but the service sucks!! They are not consistent and when me and my coworker said something to them about how little they were putting in the burrito the guy started laughing and said the people who worked there before were making them wrong... he continued laughing and went and told all employees in the back and the lady in the back just stared at me through the window in the door.. ... will not be going back to this location any longer which sucks because we would go here for lunch at least once a week!"}
{"text":"First time here! It was a interesting experience...it is definitely like a fast food place but the food was delicious!!! Their homemade taro chips are so wonderful"}
{"text":"IF YOU LOVE SUSHI AND BURRITOS THIS IS THE SPOT TO GO TO...

Now at first thought I was like this is going to be weird and strange but once I got there I was welcome and greeted with great customer service. Been going here since they opened up and the food always comes out fresh.

a must go spot if your down for something different."}
{"text":"Definitely a go to spot when I'm craving sushi. Less rice, more protein and a variety of sauces. Rolling it into a burrito is genius for eating it on the go. During lunch time it's always packed and it's a small spot so plan accordingly. If you haven't already tried this spot, you should."}
{"text":"Great place. Excellent portions for the price and very friendly fast service for lunch."}
{"text":"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE this place!!!  The staff is always so so so friendly and helpful!  Every sushi burrito I've had here has been DELICIOUS!!!  The quality of all of their ingredients are so fresh and superb, and their prices are very reasonable and affordable. I'm so glad this place is close to home!  I highly recommend this resto if you love sushi, healthy food, and great service!  YUMMMMmmmm!"}
{"text":"I went there to have dinner and the food was very good, I had the fire cracker burrito and it was ok, my coworker had the high maintenance one and definitely the high maintenance was better!! The place was ok, not too crazy about the ambiance it wasn't inviting at least for a dinner but I'm sure it is great for lunch!"}
{"text":"Definitely a neat concept. Nothing special though. I was over my sushi burrito after my first half. I wouldn't go again but their sauces were good and the fish tasted fresh. The homemade taro chips were good. Very light and airy. In my opinion, this is something you would just try once and be done with. Friendly customer service though! Oh, and you must try the mango cream soda!"}
{"text":"not bad.  way better when they first opened but im still a fan"}
{"text":"Heard this place had quality sushi burritos and it definitely lived up to its hype. And just like all my past reviews, customer service is the first thing I notice. They definitely lack in this area  but other than that no complaints here. 

Also noticed that you're able to put in orders ahead of time so that's pretty convenient for anyone in a hurry or just don't want to wait. 

Would definitely come here again and it's in the perfect spot too because it's right by the gym I go to."}
{"text":"OMG!! I was SUPER blown away from this place. I had never head of a sushi bowl (I've clearly been living under a rock.. lol). Let me tell you ... this was great. I ordered the High Maintenance w added spinach, bell pepper and roasted corn and extra yellow tail. yumm-o 

The fish was super fresh and the entire salad was the best. I ordered through Uber Eats so I don't know what the restaurant was like. Totally enough for 2 people but I decided it would be enough for only me .. 

I'm telling you , I.will order from this place EVERYTIME I come to Vegas. Sooooo good"}
{"text":"I had a huge craving for a sushi roll, but did not want to trouble myself at a decent Japanese restaurant. 

Soho sushi burrito was awesome! The sushi rice was so thin that I could taste all the flavors in my sushi burrito.

Will be back to try other things on the menu!!!"}
{"text":"I live in Guam,USA. So for sure, they wouldn't have anything like this back at home. I've only seen these on Facebook or on tumblr. But I'm really glad place was only a 15 minute drive from our hotel.

This place was amazing! YOU GET TO BUILD YOUR OWN SUSHI BURRITO! they have two options for their menu. A 'build your own' option where you get to pick what goes into your uniquely created sushi burrito. The second option, is to pick from their signature creation sushi menu such as the lion king (MUST TRY). 

For everyone who hasn't tried a sushi burrito, please do! I WISH THEY HAD THIS ON GUAM!!!! 
Wouldn't totally suggest and return for another round!"}
{"text":"Basically a big sushi roll. Wish they had these in Colorado. Good, quick, fresh, and you can get whatever you want. Didn't try it on a tortilla. Guess I'll have to come back. Also big plus is nice friendly employees."}
{"text":"Ordered a high maintenance and a custom burrito. Everything was tasty. Rice soft and chewy with a bite, nori sticking to the rice well. The nori was a bit tough to bite through however. 

The combination of my ingredients was essentially a salmon, avocado, cuc roll with some wasabi aioli (? I think that's what it was), with krab and lettuce. I would get it again! 

I was told the high maintenance was good but very filling. 

The menu is a little overwhelming and there's little room to stall once you're up to order, so make sure you know what you want before jumping into line. 

One point of contention for me was the salmon. It looked very pale. I wish I would have asked more to learned about where its from and how it's raised. If the owners see this I'd love to hear about it.

Thanks for offering a quick way to grab a nutritious bite quite for reasonable amount of sheckles."}
{"text":"This is the perfect place to get a sushi fix when you don't feel like (or don't have time for) a full-on traditional sushi meal. 

Choose from seaweed,  soy paper or tortilla wrapper. Then get it filled with delicious fresh sushi goodness such as spicy tuna, tempura shrimp, tobiko, grilled salmon, cucumber, avocado or other non-traditional sushi toppings such as pico de gallo, chipotle mayo, tomatillo sauce and guacamole.

They really cram these sushi burritos full of stuff, no skimping going on here.

There are small portion and appropriately priced sides like seaweed salad, edamame and bags of seasoned taro chips.

Flavors are bold and ingredients are fresh. Nothing on the menu has disappointed. The Twin Dragon is particularly good, but if you don't fancy one of the menu options you can get creative and build your own.

Just about the perfect fast-casual lunch spot. Once you try this you may have a hard time going back to Chipotle. Addictive, but thankfully light on the wallet.

More locations please. Summerlin needs sushi burrito love too!"}
{"text":"My little sister and I went here randomly for lunch about a week ago when I was still in Vegas. I was scared that it wouldn't be appealing so I also bought a sandwich from Subway, but I ended up giving that away! I had the Twin Dragon Roll with avocado instead of guacamole and it was delicious! We ended up splitting it because we only got one in fear that neither of us would like it. There was shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, and crabmeat inside of it with some vegetables and sauces. It was literally my favorite roll as a burrito. 

I will definitely go back when I return to visit family!"}
{"text":"To be honest I'm not a best fan of sushi, so I had mixed feelings coming here. I'm still trying to get used to it so I was glad they had meat options available. I really had no expectations but I was impressed. I had the Santa Fe burrito and it was amazing! Customer service was super friendly and fast, I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic and fresh, I got the twin dragon it was amazing. The employees were also amazing, they were so helpful seeing as I had never been to a sushi burrito place!"}
{"text":"I love poke and I love burritos. You put them together and get SOHO.  I had shrimp tempura, and salmon for protein. Love the concept. Hopefully we'll get something like th is in L.A. someday."}
{"text":"Was in Vegas last week and a friend told me about this place . I tried it and this place was the bomb .... The combination of sushi in a wrap was interesting and  tasty! Next time in in Vegas that the first place in going to go to! M. H."}
{"text":"First time here... and last. Food OK, service OK. Music too loud to hear when ordering or paying.

$0.50 extra PER SCOOP for masago? For. Get. It. I will never cheat on Sweet Poke again.

The prices are comprable, until you start getting the ingredients that you actually want. Extra for meats, extra for avocado, extra for quinoa (which you cannot get in place of rice), extra for masago, extra for this, extra for that, extra I'm out of here."}
{"text":"First time here & had a sushi bowl, it's awesome! Love the concept. Everything is very fresh. Boyfriend & daughter also love their sushi burritos. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Excellent food!  Super creative!!  We had a sushi burrito and the Vegan one...both were stellar!"}
{"text":"Soho is the way to go! Best sushi burritos in town hands down. Large menu and can even build your own. I never do Bc the twin dragon roll is so good. We always get two burritos so we have one for dinner so good. Friendly staff and clean restaurant!"}
{"text":"Try the firecracker burrito with seaweed wrap which has spicy tuna in it, tastes really good, for the price, you can't beat it ...also get the salmon poke salad bowl, which is very fresh and tasty...will come back and try some more stuff since this one is near my house,  been to the one on Sahara and it is always crowded ..this one is nice and quiet.."}
{"text":"It's a unique eatery that features sushi wraps in burrito, you pick the sushi u want, get the one with seaweed..its good, the chef is from Soho Japanese restaurant , one of the best business in yelp rating"}
{"text":"First experience - sushi burrito. It turned out to be an extra large sushi roll. We ordered the fire cracker which to my surprise the heat was manageable. I also got the mango boba. Too sweet,  but the boys madder it fun.  It's an ok ambiance. Nothing horrible yet nothing amazing about this place."}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh ingredients.  Lots of options and good size portions.  Staff was very friendly and helpful, full of good suggestion for a first time visitor.  Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Finally got to try it! The taro chips were so good! I would love these as a snack all the time! I tried the twin dragon burrito with soy paper since it was recommended. It was okay.. My boyfriend got the triple s burrito with soy paper. That was more my taste, spicier. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Food: 3
Service: 4
Overall: 3.5

Been a couple times and enjoyed the novelty, but overall, let's call it what it is: a very large sushi roll. Haha. 

For lunch, I ordered the Twin Dragon and a the Melon Cream Soda. Flavor wise, its nothing to brag about. Same fillings as you would get at a normal sized sushi roll but needs more seasoning for my taste. It's not bland, there's no \"wow\" factor for me, it just served it's purpose of something decent to calm my hunger. If you're like me after eating an AYCE sushi, you get hungry an hour later.

A little bit out of my way but I'll still come back to see if I like any of the other menu items and try the rice bowls next time maybe, but I'm in no rush. Service wise though, I get my food fast and the team making the food are always upbeat! Always a good thing when someone's hangry."}
{"text":"I always come here everytime I go to Vegas! Everything is really fresh! The way to go is building your own Suhi burrito!"}
{"text":"This place is busy! They deliver quickly and it is delicious.  The burritos are huge ! Like two or three sushi rolls.  The taro chips were delicious.  The edamame was served cold , which I prefer hot.  Seating is plastic chairs , very casual."}
{"text":"Great easy to have the best of both worlds. I've ordered the menu ones, but prefer to build my own sushi burrito."}
{"text":"Loved it!!! 

This place is amazing, from the chill atmosphere, to the welcoming staff wrapping the protein packed deliciousness of their burritos.  Both burritos that I had tonight (Sunny Salmon with Seaweed wrap and Lion King with soy wrap) were loaded up with tons of fresh ingredients.  

Sunny Salmon consists of Salmon, Surimi Crab, cream cheese, lettuce, pico de gallo, crispy wonton strips and Shiso tomatillo sauce for me it tasted a little dry and too healthy(lol) like a huge wrapped salad think it needed more sauce or dressing.

The Lion King however was perfect (for me) and the star of the evening loaded with Grilled Salmon, lettuce, cream cheese, pico de gallo, tempura crunch, mango soy, furkake and sweet chipotle mayo. 

 I will be back to try the other burritos and for that sweet chipotle mayo thinking I might substitute that out in the Sunny Salmon next time. 

Definitely recommend checking this place out,  oh yeah they also have beer available for those that might like something more than a fountain drink. :)"}
{"text":"Just yummmm. Great service and fresh sushi bowl and sushi burrito! Def will come by again!"}
{"text":"A friend took me to this place. I was super skeptical about the place just because the name didnt sound like a combination that was appetizing. Sushi and burrito?!? But I was nicely surprised by the menu and the quality of fish. I was glad that they had a variety of different wraps available - like Nori! The food was good and the staff was very friendly. Tried the 3 amigos and it was awesome. I would come back to this place on my next trip to vegas."}
{"text":"There's no sushi burrito back home so took advantage of this place when I visited Vegas! This place is not too far from the strip so if you want some cheaper sushi, I highly recommend checking out this place. I mean, if you really can't get away from the casino, it's not too far from Palace. Anyways, the inside was clean with enough seating area. You go up to the counter and order. 

I had the 3 Amigos which contained three different fishes (ahi tuna, yellowtail, and salmon). I thought the portion of fishes was good and I didn't feel like the portion of rice was significantly greater. It wasn't overly salty or saucy which I prefer because I like the taste of the raw fish. My boyfriend got the Twin Dragon which was decent. It was a little too creamy for my taste. 

Our burritos were wrapped in tightly so I didn't have trouble eating them. Come check out this place if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Hi. I heard great comments about this place but I think is time to open a new location in Henderson Nevada victory village plaza is located in lake mead parkway and boulder highway and is a great time for a new location the business booming in this part of Henderson is excellent why because the economy is growing every day just take a look one day and see the traffic in this area is amazing. Thank you."}
{"text":"Inconsistent as fuck. They need to train their workers on what is considered a \"Serving\" of proteins. I ordered 3 servings of tuna,salmon, and yellowtail  once and I got 3 scoops salmon, 3 scoops tuna, but only 2 scoops yellowtail. Shouldnt i get 3 scoops of yellowtail then? I had to tell my server to add another scoop and he gave me some dirty ass looks.  Fuck off mate, dont skimp on my food. Either give me two scoops of all proteins or be consistent and give me three."}
{"text":"Love this place!!  It's a really good price for fresh fish. It's hard to get to because the plaza is under construction but that didn't stop people. The line was so long when I came with a friend on Thursday night!  When you go you can get combos either in a bowl or burrito. They also give you the option of seaweed or soy paper. I chose to get the burrito since that seemed to be the most popular. I went with the high maintenance without red onions. I added grilled corn and spinach ( trying to be healthy you know) and added the wasabi aioli as well. Instead of Guac... Which I thought it was kind of weird, they were able to substitute it with avocado instead.   The burrito had yellowtail and spicy tuna. It was so good!  I thought the fish was really fresh and loved all taste of the combo together. I really didn't taste the wasabi but the combo of the wasabi aioli and cilantro dressing paired with the fish really well. 

I would definitely go back and try other combinations and the highly recommended taro chips!"}
{"text":"If you are craving for sushi and dont mind eating it Burrito style, you are in the right spot. Great staff, but most of all, AWESOME food!!!

A must when in this town."}
{"text":"I love sushi, and sushi burrito is top 3 locations in Vegas, and that is saying something. I won't write a long review bc when it comes to sushi the thing that matters most is freshness - these fish are super fresh and moderately priced. Awesome place."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. It's not actually a burrito, it's a massive roll that is uncut. You can do a build your own. We were in Vegas for 5 days and ate here the last 2 days. If I lived here, I'd probably be here 3-4 times a week. Try it right now.........."}
{"text":"This place is great! I went in with high expectations and they were fully met! So delicious! Also so cool that you get to customize your sushi burrito! I wish there was one of these places closer to where I live because I would be here all the time! I ordered the sushi burrito with shrimp tempura and crab and cream cheese and avocado and a bunch of other deliciousness! Yum!"}
{"text":"I ordered the \"High Maintenance\" burrito with soy paper fro the wrap.  Again, deliciousness....how else to describe the text, crunchy, and fresh fish! My burrito was even more extraordinary because I added salmon to it!!

The ambience is casual, clean, and the employees are inviting.  
This is the first and best sushi burrito and poke bowl place in town.
Its a must come, if you want a change in pace for the normal day to day food choices!!!"}
{"text":"Very consistent, no fishy smell, always tasting fresh!

I would come to this place for days! I love the fact that  you can order half of each, that way you can get 2 different kinds. My combo is usually the \"3 amigo\" and \"sunny salmon\" also like option of creating your own."}
{"text":"Never in my life would I have thought that a \"sushi burrito\" would be appetizing. Boy, was I wrong!! The concept of this place alone makes for an interesting restaurant but this is more of a \"fast food\" / Port of Subs kind of deal. (Still amazing!!!) This was my first time eating their food and I chose the Twin Dragon (although you can custom make your own roll/bowl) this was better than actual sushi rolls. It had spicy tuna, crab and shrimp tempura.  (my three favorites) and on TOP of the delicious burrito I had, when I got into the restaurant the line was ridiculously long however the service was fast and all the employees had smiles on their faces. Whoever invented this concept is a food God! The only thing I do have to say is that the burrito was pretty much falling apart as I was eating it so it made for a messy lunch but that in no way brings down these 5 stars. I wish I could give it more stars because this place deserves it! Just waiting for a location in Summerlin!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi burrito  the price is not too bad 
Forsure coming back next time i'm in Vegas"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of this concept..1st time had the Twin Dragon \"as is\" off the menu...fantastic taste, fresh, filling. Next time ill ask for a little more heat. Not in my neighborhood, but its worth the effort to get there."}
{"text":"I've heard great things about this place so decided to give them a try. 

Fish and ingredients seemed fresh but I was disappointed  you have to pay extra for a few toppings that come free at one of their competitors. Good food none the less"}
{"text":"I'm so happy they opened a second location closer to my house now! They can turn any sushi burrito into a poke bowl instead, which is awesome! Their bowls are a decent size. If you enjoy eating spicy food get the honey habanero sauce. 

The reason why I marked down a star is because if you want to create your own poke bowl you can only choose 1 choice of fish. If you want more it's $1.50 more. I like how other places if you order a small you get 2 choices, medium 3 choices and large 5 choices. I think they should do the same as well. 

I ordered a 3 amigos sushi bowl and added some seaweed salad. They charged me $1.50 just to add a lil bit of seaweed salad. I think that's a pretty steep just to charge just for an extra side to my bowl. My entire bowl cost $13 before tip. It's a bit pricey than other places"}
{"text":"My kids are sushi fanatics like their mommy so love it here. This is a fun trendy new spot so if your coming in during lunch or dinner hours expected a long line and no tables to sit at. So far for all the times I've been here all the fish has been fresh. Let's hope they keep that up. 

Bad things I can note is that I found a piece of plastic in my sushi burrito here before and that was not a nice surprise and depending on your burrito roller that if they don't roll it tight enough it will all fall apart in your hand making it very difficult to eat. 

Taro chips with cheddar dip is amazeballs. Light, thin, crispy, and perfectly seasoned the way any chip should taste. Goes great with their salsa too!! Loveeeee their salsa lol"}
{"text":"10\" long with good girth, firm yet quivering as you take it in your hand almost as if it's yearning to release its inner goodness as it enters your mouth.  Doing two at once; well double the pleasure, double the fun!

The sushi burrito.

Basically an uncut makisushi roll stuffed full with west coast poke bowl ingredients. 

Straight up, everyday ingredients.  No organic this or line caught that.  Fish is previously frozen, gassed and color added. Crab is Krab.   Everyday rice.  Sushi rice is sticker than most, brown rice, the inexpensive kind that makes noobs cringe with its nutty flavor.

Loads of poke bowl ingredients, some cooked, some raw, some different (grilled steak or deep fried soft shell crab, roasted corn, pico de gallo) and loads of them.  Fillings make up 90% of the roll.  Don't worry, a machine compacts the roll and seals everything in.

First timers opt for premade rolls, good flavor with the right choice of fillings.  Adventurous, opt for do it yourself.  Choose a wrapper (nori, soy paper, or tortilla), rice (sushi, brown, unseasoned white), protein, sauce, and veg.

Be creative and go crazy.  It's part of the fun.  Let's just say a soft shell crab and unagi with creamy cilantro sauce, jalepeno peppers, avocado, and seaweed salad killed it!  Bravo me!

Very fast, friendly, off Strip service.  Good prices.  All options sub $10.

Satisfying and leaves you with a glow and smile."}
{"text":"One of my new favorite places! Terrific, personable, and helpful staff make you feel welcome. I hope they are paid well, but even so, pay tips to these people. The menu is very well designed with plenty of customization or you can choose from combinations they have already thought out. These are the best poke/sushi burritos I have had, not just in Las Vegas either. This place has a great reputation and you can see why if you choose to come here. The food is delicious, fresh and good for you. I must come here all the time now!"}
{"text":"So good. Every time I come to Vegas I go here. Food is fresh and staff is nice. Go early because the line can go out the door."}
{"text":"The Struggle is Real - 

Today at lunch, I've seen nothing but struggle and bad customer service. I love this place - don't get me wrong. The firecracker is so spicy and delicious, I crave it in my sleep. I never come here during the lunch rush since I don't like to drive hungry/hangry. My co-workers and bosses wanted some sushi burrito so we decided that i'd snack beforehand and venture. SO this review not based on HANGRY-me's interlude. The place was hoppin'. The line was long, but they were moving along. Diligent worker bees they are. The problems are listed below:

1. The person who does the rice part seemed to care more about making nice with her co-workers than she cared to be polite with the customers. 
  - This isn't some street food join, have some respect.

2. There were two people dealing with the insides of the burrito as well as the forming and wrapping of it. They seemed really hasty and one guy pretty much didn't care how it rolled. Needless to say, some of our burritos fell apart...

3. The guy writing the orders on the wrappers - he was screwing up big time leaving the cashier guy really really pissed. The order before us seemed to be wrong and the cashier had to open one of their burritos and couldn't figure it out so he had to make another one on the fly..making the wait longer. 

4. The cashier guy had a face that easily left a bad taste in my co-workers mouth. She also didn't appreciate the fact that he was opening up all these burritos with his cash-handled hands, wrapping it back up, and serving it to us. I get that it's really annoying that the guy before you is screwing up on writing the orders properly, but I feel like if you're handling money, you shouldn't handle the food.

All of our burritos fell apart, but we enjoyed the taste. Just wish that they knew how to handle the lunch rush without any issues.

The guy writing on the wrappers though..he needs to learn to code the burritos correctly so people get charged correctly and ALSO so that the cashier doesn't have to open it up.

Tastes good, but service needs a bit of work.

This place is really popular though, maybe an expansion is in order for the weekdays! - Just kidding, what do I know about business."}
{"text":"We drive past here every day and finally made the very good decision to have lunch.  Service was fast, we had two of the full size sushi burritos and it was far more than enough for two of us, I would order the smaller one next time.  Both orders were excellent.  I would describe it like a more awesome \"subway\" - Oder what you want, add what you like, this much of this sauce, that much of that one.  Would definitely return.  Line moves fast but it definitely lines up - we went around 11:30AM on Friday and were glad we beat the rush."}
{"text":"Sushi burrito whaaat?! Yes!! I been tp this place a few times and everytime I go in the employees are really friendly. Only downside I say is that it can get pretty busy sometimes (because they are that good) and there were time were the line would go past the door. But i think it's worth it."}
{"text":"I'm not usually a guy who stops at sushi fast food, but I was in a hurry the other day.  The food is GOOD.  The fish is fresh.  And I'll be back again soon.  Great concept!"}
{"text":"Omg this place is amazing!  I was vacationing in Vegas and happened to stumble across this place when I was getting a pedicure off of the strip.  The fish is so fresh and the burritos were AMAZING! I ate here 3 times in the week I was in Vegas!  Prices are really good too.  I thought I found  a great Sushi burrito place in Chicago but Soho blows them out of the water!  Seating is very limited but who cares, get it to go and eat it in your car!"}
{"text":"I was a little nervous about coming here but my wife insisted we try it because we are both big sushi fans. It's actually pretty cool I can make your own sushi burrito. We opted to go the more traditional route instead of getting crazy with the flour tortilla with sushi and other raw fish with lettuce and salsa, etc. I got the Barito on rice and seaweed paper with tuna crab cream cheese, shrimp tempura avocado wasabi aioli and chipotle mayo. It was great. Not too expensive either for Vegas."}
{"text":"Loved this place!! Such a great concept... I had their unagi special roll / burrito and it was so good will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This place is the best.  I love all the options they have available.  Of the poke places in town I have tried it definitely has the best flavors,  options and freshness.  The staff is friendly."}
{"text":"I've had the opportunity to visit this location about 10 times at least in the past 8 months. 
* Food is excellent 
* Service gets 5 stars as well, they are always happy to help and patient when a customer is deciding on what to get. 
* My go-to favorite at this point is the Sunny Salmon. Remove the pico de gallo and swap the sauce for their chipotle sauce and you're in for a treat. 

* If you work in the area, they give you a 10% discount. 

Thank you Soho!"}
{"text":"Flavorful & Fresh! At first we were skeptical of the portions. We weren't sure of we wanted the burrito after we saw the bowl. However, once we decided on the burrito we were glad we did. We were so full and the taro chips and cheese topped it off. No complaints during our visit. It was worth it."}
{"text":"This place was delicious! Twin dragon is my fave. I add extra jalapeños and use a ton of ginger. Waaaaaaaayyyyyyy better than JaBurrito"}
{"text":"I am a creature of habit.

My order here has been the same since they opened. Most of the employees know exactly what I'm going to get, too. I appreciate that they remember me :). 2 firecrackers (as is), build your own bowl and taro chips (furikake) to go.

In addition to being a creature of habit, I'm also kinda particular. I've never been disappointed here. They don't care that I don't want sauce and ask them to douse my bowl with straight sriracha. They happily add avocado, gently reminding me that it's an additional .50. Of course, guys and gals. I don't mind paying you extra for avo. They recently added diced mango to the list of toppings. Quinoa, too, but it's extra even if you don't get rice. I'd like to take this moment to suggest putting quinoa as an alternative to rice with no upcharge. I'm going grain free, guys. It's only another extra .50, but it's a small scoop and I gotta get my carbs somehow. 

The ahi and salmon are always fresh and plentiful, as are the veggies. I've never had an issue with the fish. I've never had an issue with anything here. Burritos never seem to fall apart, even when stuffed full. There isn't much room to sit and typical times for the rushes are busy. The staff handles it.

I'm happy to report that it's still my go-to lunch spot in the area."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The ppl who works there know you by name and the fantastic food is beyond this world."}
{"text":"I wanted to try something different for my first visit to Vegas. I highly recommend this place. The prices are reasonable and you get full fast!! More of a local joint so you know it will be something different and fun to try!! If u get the chance stop by and experience something new and fun!!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat on campus for vegetarians. I eat here 87% of the time during the school year :)"}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is always fresh, prices are reasonable, service is usually good. I did have an incident where they made a slight mistake with my order from ubereats. However this was only 1 time out of the numerous times I have ordered from them."}
{"text":"Very similar quality to the other sushi burrito places in the area.  Ingredients seem of great quality.  Service is very pleasant.  Taro chips are better than anyone else's.  Cheese too.  My only complaint is that the burrito doesn't hold itself together very well.  I'll just have to grab a fork next time."}
{"text":"Very good place! I got the bowl and it was so filling , it's pretty much a price of a roll so it's good , will come back"}
{"text":"I was really surprised with how good these sushi burritos were. I built my own burrito and my boyfriend got the 3 amigos. We also got an order of jalapeno taro chips. The taro chips were delicious and had a great kick to them and weren't heavy. Both the burritos were refreshing and had lots of flavor and texture."}
{"text":"Bad service rude employees, could not understand the woman taking our order, after we finally got our order placed, we encountered a very rude young man at the register , he acted like we were a inconvenience too him.
The food was second rate, poor quality sushi stuffed in a seaweed and rice wrap the flavor of the seaweed was nonexistent, I like seaweed and this was the same flavor as my napkin.
We had three or their rolls and they were all mediocre.
Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Impressive menu with so many options to choose from! I ordered the Triple S and it was pretty good but the soft shell crab just didn't taste right to me. Next time I went I ordered the Caterpillar also pretty good but they put way too much crab, it wasn't balanced. Other than that everything was super tasty and you definitely get your money's worth of food. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Can't say enough about how awesome the service is every time I go here and the food is amazing!! Keep up the great work guys! Just love me some Soho!!"}
{"text":"Omg! Delicious place to eat Sushi, innovated and original concept, the customer service is great, the explained everything on the menu before you order and accommodated to your needs, pretty fast to prepared the food and very clean, definitely come back, I will recommend 100%"}
{"text":"First timer. Good fusion food and lots to choose from but this one female employee that put my burrito together butchered it. She just threw everything on it carelessly and when it came time to wrap it she ripped the seaweed wrap apart and still continued to cover it w the paper. I knew eating a sushi burrito could get messy but I had a little harder time eating this properly so I just gave up and ate the whole thing w a fork. Otherwise, pretty good."}
{"text":"Place is simple, fresh, affordable, and quick. Great place to get a quick lunch within 15 mins or less. Also great choice of eating healthy and getting full."}
{"text":"This was an awesome visit. The sushi burritos are way larger than I expected. We ordered the 3 Amigos and Caterpillar roll and both were good. When I asked for no green onions on the Caterpillar roll they actually asked me if I wanted to substitute an ingredient for it and suggested masago. I think that was super cool because at other restaurants they would never have done this. 

I also really like the idea of building your own burrito from scratch. If I came a few more times I definitely would give that a try as the combinations would be endless. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I was not to keen on checking this place out. After having a not so pleasant experience at Soho Sushi a few years back, I was convinced that Soho SushiBurrito would be more of the same. WRONG- this place was magical! The workers were extraordinarily helpful and patient with me and my daughter. We ordered the Lion King since we both cannot consume raw meats. It had cooked salmon, tempura, chipotle mayo, rice, lettuce, pico de gallo, teriyaki sauce, and a seaweed wrapper. Words cannot adequately express how great the Lion King sushi burrito tasted.

I later surprised my husband with a sushi burrito at his job. He was so pleased that his eyes were rolling in the back of his head. His team at work saw how much he loved it and now they are eager to try Soho SushiBurrito. After eating the Lion King, all I can say is 'Hakuna Matata.'"}
{"text":"Customer service was great, nothing to complaint about!  I knew that sooner or later someone is gonna get tired of having to wait for someone to cut the rolls up!!  I think it's a great idea!  Most importantly the ingredients are decently fresh for rolls and the flavored are just right!  Props to the people behind the counter making the rolls!  It was soon good I had a second one!"}
{"text":"If you want a quick on the go sushi bowl or sushi burrito? This is the place to go! I'm pretty much a regular here lol when I really want AYCE but I'm on a budget this place seriously is worth the money. There's sushi burrito options already there for you or you can build your own burrito. Same goes for the bowls they have there too or, you can build your own. I always get soft shell crab, ahi tuna, salmon and eel. I'll switch it up and get spicy tuna instead of ahi tuna. I love all the options for toppings and the extra .50 charge for certain items is worth it for things like masago or seaweed salad. I normally only spend $13-$17 here depending if I get a combo or just a bowl. Extra protein is only $1.50 too so it's deff. Reasonable for the amount you're getting. I always end up getting full and end up having left overs. This place is great!!! I've tried other places like this on other parts of town but this I'll always be loyal to this place after trying the different options.

Only thing that knocked the 1 star down was the pico de gallo I had last time and the soft shell crab. It seemed undercooked and the pico de gallo didn't seem fresh, it tasted a little off. I think it was just that one time I got it bc I've gone back after that and ordered the same thing (my usual) and had no problems with the pico or crab other times."}
{"text":"What a great concept! I love it here. My fav so far is the twin dragon and the three amigos. You can also substitute the type of fish you want it and they give you choice of wrapper, either seaweed, soypaper or a mixed greens bowl. Every time I visit, I bring in a new friend with me. Just wished you could order by phone or online so you can pick up your order and not have to wait sooo long in line."}
{"text":"Don't be sidelined by the combination of sushi and burrito please. This combination creates the stuff that dreams are made of. They have Vegan menu items as well for those Vegans out there:)
Highest-quality sushi and toppings, everything moved rapidly here and constant deliveries of fresh Sushi and all else:)
Customizable bowls and burritos- which cannot be surpassed.  This is the most creative sushi / burrito combos around. Choose a menu item or simply be your own Yoda-like master and create your own burrito or bowl:)"}
{"text":"Clean!
Fresh, Grade A quality sushi and ingredients here!
Friendly and accommodating staff- a pleasure!
The food, GO and have some!
Create a burrito! A bowl!
Add that wasabi aioli and I'm telling you!"}
{"text":"I was excited when I heard that soho had opened a location closer to where I live, unfortunately this location is not quite the same.  My sister ordered her usual \"Lion King\" burrito, which flavorwise was the same but significantly smaller. I'm guessing since the rolls are hand rolls it's harder to have more stuffing. 
My fiancé and I decided to try out the poke bowls, which looked nothing like the photos we'd seen previously. Fiancé got the Lahaina bowl with white rice, which he enjoyed the taste but felt something was missing. I got the Waikiki bowl with mixed greens. If I had left it as is I would have been very disappointed, luckily I had the foresight to add cucumber and tempura crunch along with additional sauce. In comparison to other poke bowl places, Soho lacks presentation and customization options. 
If I'm really hankering for a sushi burrito and don't feel like driving to Sahara then I'll go here. But I'd suggest sticking with the Sahara location."}
{"text":"A couple of sushi burrito places had been popping up back where I came from in Virginia, but I never went to check them out before moving to Vegas. Seeing my friends' pictures never really looked the appetizing. I love sushi, but the thought of making it into a burrito seemed like too much of a good thing to me.
Well just so happened that my family and I needed to grab lunch before an appointment to go wedding dress shopping and just so happen that this place was right across the street from the boutique. I figured why not give it a shot since this place has such great reviews. I was pleasantly surprised! There were four of us and each of us got a different sushirito; all were wonderful. Portions sizes left you satisfied, and not overly stuffed. Great balance of flavors in their signature rolls.

I feel like if I'm craving sushi but don't necessarily feel like dishing out the money for AYCE, then this place will definitely satisfy!  Can't wait to go back and try more!

Also the taro chips are a must!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Triple S and husband got the Angry Tuna. We switched our halves, but we ended up regretting the switch, as we much preferred our original choices. 

I like this concept, but the burritos are really large and filling. I found myself only able to eat about ¾ of it. I'd order a smaller size if it were possible! The layout of the store is kind of like Chipotle - you stand in a line and order down the row. I can't ever see myself getting a bowl as complicated as some patrons order (how do you even eat that tower of food?); I'd probably do a very minimalist bowl."}
{"text":"This place recently changed their name and adjusted their menu, but the former Jaburrito is still a great lunch option.

The sushi burritos (which are very popular in NorCal but only now gaining ground in Clark County) are on the spot.  I like the fact that if I'm not. In the mood for sushi wrap, they can give me a tortilla instead. The rice, fish, and everything else on the sushi burritos are excellent.

This place is fast becoming one of my preferred lunch stops when I'm in that part of town."}
{"text":"interesting concept. had a spicy tuna roll, seaweed wrapper, cukes, cilantro, green onion with shiso sauce. not very shiso flavored. had sushi rice as the brown rice is just steamed, not seasoned. had the special which includes the taro chips (furikake) of course. delicious. would return again and it's worth every penny. employees are great! the salad bar of sauces is a nice touch. location is a bit strange, i think. if it were in summerlin, downtown or town square, it would be packed (sro). a must try yelpers!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy we finally have something good to eat at the Student Union. For years, it's been Panda Express and Subway which is why I'd only come to SU for drinks from Jamba or Starbucks. Or I'd go across the street for edible options. 

This place opens at 9:30am which is pretty sweet because I can grab my 2nd breakfast and lunch before I go to my class. It's super convenient for students and other UNLV peeps. They've only been open for a few days and the line gets pretty crazy. However, they move quite fast so the wait isn't too bad - well, maybe, except when people in front of you stare at the menu for hours and still couldn't decide what to get. You're sh|+ out of luck. Hopefully, you can utilize the pictures of the menu I posted so, you're not THAT person.

Just like the other Soho locations, they have sushi burritos or sushi burrito bowls, chips, edamame, mochi, etc. They have signature combos or you can build your own. Brown rice, white rice, sushi rice, salad, tofu + your choice of protein (salmon, surimi, tuna, chicken, steak, veggie asada, tempura, soft shell crab...you get the idea) + veggies and texture enhancers (crunch, wontons) + sauce.

What I usually get are: Sunny Salmon, 3 Amigos, Rebel, Twin Dragon...or I customize my bowl. 

They're pretty chill with substitutions as long as it's of similar category - like green onions instead of red onions. Don't expect them to swap your red onions with spicy tuna - life doesn't work that way!

They're open til 8pm and closed on Sunday. They don't have chopsticks but everyone knows how to use a fork. So, goooo!!!"}

{"text":"Sushi Burritos!  Loved it.  My only complaint is that there isn't one in State College!  I'm be back for sure."}
{"text":"Can't get enough of this place. Love the SushiBurritos!  The Firecracker burrito is a giant spicy tuna roll. Plus always friendly staff, but be prepared for a long line at lunch and dinner times."}
{"text":"The place had a lot of options. I enjoyed looking at the menu and seeing the plethora of choices they had. I like the fact that they had other things other than fish. Have a good variety to things. I live in Cali, but definitely going to come back when I come back to Vegas."}
{"text":"The food here was awesome. The people working there were either having an off day or not all there. They weren't friendly and when asked about a pick up order their answer was just I don't know.  Well then, I don't know if I'll be back."}
{"text":"This was the first restaurant I went to, upon moving here to Vegas.  Great first impressions!  I'm a vegetarian, so I had the tofu burrito.  I can't remember everything I had on it, but there are so many options.  The place was crammed when we were there - and no wonder.  I love the fusion of sushi and Mexican.  You wouldn't think these two things could go together, but they do, and it's yummy.  Definitely plan on returning here."}
{"text":"Chef John can do no wrong.

The saddest day was when the Soho Japanese Restaurant went to dinner only. I was thrilled to learn that Soho SushiBOWLrrito opened this past weekend and it's just down the street.

The location is just near the Starbucks (perfect) and right off the 215 and Jones.
My coworkers and I picked up an order to go - and we all got the Twin Dragon and a side of seaweed salad.

The staff was friendly and attentive!  The store was spotless! Everything looked amazing.
The food was what dreams are made of. Do you ever get full but you keep eating anyway because it tastes SO good? Well, I do and I did. Everything was so fresh, so delicious - and the flavor combinations - PERFECT. I would like to bathe in the guacamole that was in my sushiburrito. I  promised myself that I would try the twin dragon next time as a bowl with some taro chips but I also want to try every signature roll on the menu.

This location also has Poke and Teriyaki bowls as well so there's lots for everyone. 
I LOVED the seaweed salad - it could not have been any better - it was refreshing and clean. When something so simple can be so perfect - this is a MUST TRY! Thank me later.

I look forward to my next visit which I'm sure will be sometime this week. 
So bookmark it, tell your friends, tell you everyone you know - Soho SushiBowlrrito is the BEST (other than Soho Japanese Restaurant)."}
{"text":"Great selection of sushi burritos... I used UberEATS when ordering and it's very convenient especially for college students like me. I got the 3 Amigos sushiritto and that filled me up quite well. However, I was disappointed in the Soho Bowl that I ordered because the ahi was basically like a cotton ball like poke, stuck together. I thought that the ahi would be a square but in this case, it wasn't. The spicy ahi is a little too spicy for me but that's just me. Next time and for all of my upcoming visits, I will stick to the sushiritto and not the bowl. 

Definitely use UberEATS when ordering. I haven't visited the actual store yet but will UPDATE this review when I do!"}
{"text":"This place is great. It's tucked away in some random shopping place behind Landrys just west of the strip on sahara. I got the dragon roll. Amazing."}
{"text":"Pretty amazing sushi. Definitely gonna become a usual place for me when I can't get my all you can eat fix. Prices aren't too bad as well, very filling. Place is very clean and the workers seem busy, but thorough with how they prepare your order."}
{"text":"Ridiculously good!  Not sure you can go wrong with anything on the menu. We had the High Maintenance and the Triple S with Taro chips and cheese. Mmmmmmmm!  

The line might look long but the crew is highly efficient and the line moves fast. The tables turn over quickly so we had no problem getting a spot to sit after ordering. One of my new favorite lunch spots!  I love you, Soho SushiBurrito!"}
{"text":"I have been there three times in two weeks. Seriously can't get enough! It's fresh, quick and the location is clean with friendly staff,"}
{"text":"Okay this place had some great reviews and is right across from palace station where I'm staying for few nights. It's a great concept and marketing of something that's been around forever. 

It's not a burrito first of all what it really is, a full sushi roll cut in half and packaged like a burrito that's it. You go in and can choose standard seaweed or soy paper then they ask what you want In it. It's a customized sushi roll. They have some that are already designated rolls or go for the complete custom choice. 

I wasn't impressed it's a great concept who ever came up with it but all it is, is a sushi roll. I basically paid $14 for a meal that came with 1 roll some taro chips and a drink. I rather have gone to a sushi bar and paid few more dollars and gotten all you can eat. I wasn't full after the meal. 

Would I go back again? Only if it was my only option   
Otherwise I'd skip it."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying a sushi burrito, and it just might be my new favorite thing! I had the Angry Tuna with no onions and no wonton strips, and it was absolutely delicious! AND healthy! Prices are pretty reasonable too. I will definitely be back to try more items from their menu. YUM!"}
{"text":"Oh how I love this place! If you need a sushi fix and don't want to break the bank, this place will make you happy. I found out about soho from a Facebook post a friend had posted raving about it. I liked the concept, so the kids and I drove to try it out. The kids burrito is like a California roll, which my youngest one loved. The older kid liked the double dragon and I got the three amigos. Everything was fresh and delicious! Their combinations have the best mixture of sweet, spicy, and crunchy texture, it's like eating a really big sushi roll. I have been back at least a dozen times since and have tried the bowls, and other burritos. My fave is still the three amigos. The employees here are soooo nice and polite, even with difficult customers. I once witnessed a cop in front of me, asking the burrito makers to all change out their gloves because she's allergic to peppers, and jalapeños might have come in contact with them. They quickly grabbed a fresh box of gloves and changed them right there. There was a full line of people waiting behind us, but they never showed the least bit of annoyance. If you love sushi...and want a less expensive option, seriously try a sushi burrito!"}
{"text":"Issa NO for me dawg!

I ordered my \"poke\" bowl through Uber Eats and I probably should've went there physically so I can be particular about it.

The portions were disproportionate. I checked the 'spicy poke' as my main protein in the app but I BARELY even tasted it. It was more like a \"spicy imitation crab and seaweed bowl\" which by the way are considered add-ons. 

I'm a bit flabbergasted by the glowing reviews of this place but then again, I probably should've went in myself. Also, this was one of the few poke options in Uber Eats. 

For a bowl less than 10-bucks it raised an eyebrow and I wasn't expecting much. Compared to other poke bowls I've had in the area and beyond, this was by far the worst but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt."}
{"text":"What is this? Its like a sushi roll, less rice more ingredients. This place is awesome..it is CHIPOTLE with sushi ingredients..you can ask for the menu burritos ranging from soft shell crab, shrimp tempura, spicy tuna and so forth. The menu are for people who cant decide what to put in it. You can omit items also..like i get TRIPLE S no jalapenos..but your feeling adventurous. .you can build your own.  You can order them as a burrito (seaweed or soy), nachos,  bowl, or the boring tortilla.  Plus they have a condiment station at end of line..wasabi, soy sauce (shoyu for us hawaiians), pickled ginger, and other things that make accompany sushi. During lunch line is long be prepared to be inline for 30 mins..but its worth the wait. Oh and the trick to eating it is keep it in the paper while your eating it so the ingredients dont fall out!"}
{"text":"Love this place  great customer service and the food is amazing .my go to is the twin dragon on soy wrapp.."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! It's like 2-3 delicious sushi rolls in one big burrito and the price of one roll. I'm going here like once a week! Pretty busy around lunch time though so plan ahead."}
{"text":"So pumped to see the option to order online! One of my favorite lunches but the line makes it a bit difficult. Being busy is a great problem to have but happy this was remedied to make it even easier to get our fix.

Love twin dragon in a bowl.  So good!"}
{"text":"I feel the same way about this place as I do with all poke/sushi burrito places. Overpriced and such small portions when you compare it to other customizable quick service restaurants (Chipotle, any of the personalized pizza places). That being said, all of them for the most part have excellent food.

I normally make my own bowl and that's exactly what I did. I usually get sushi rice, salmon, ahi tuna, and yellowtail. The difference here was the honey habanero which is a solid sauce and compliments the wasabi aoili well. Then I get the cucumber for that freshness, furikake for that extra flavor on the rice, and avacado & tempura crunch for texture and more flavor. 

Like I mentioned earlier...excellent food but overpriced for the portions you are getting. When you have so many options with all these sushiburrito places opening up and your paying $9-12 on a bowl or burrito you can easily go to chipotle and get more food for less..."}
{"text":"Finally. I got the chance to stop by, and boy, I was not disappointed. The prices are not bad, the produce and protein looked fresh, the staff was amazingly nice. 
It's very \"chipotle\" based, where as you choose your own toppings for your sushi burrito. 
You almost can't go wrong with any of the protein choices, but make sure you get cucumber and top it off with tempura bits for that perfect crunch at the end!!"}
{"text":"Love this place ! It's the first place i go to when i come to Vegas !! Yummy  food and great service ! What are you waiting for ? get up and try it out!!!"}
{"text":"This place is one of the coolest restaurants in town. The idea, like the food is fresh, and the line usually provides some awesome people watching. The new online order thing is pretty great too. I highly recommend this place to everyone. EVERYONE!"}
{"text":"What an amazing experience I had today at Soho Sushi.
Right after I ordered a sushi for pickup, I had a family emergency and couldn't pick up my order right away. 
When I arrived hours late, they immediately made a new fresh sushi for me. 
Thank you for an amazing customer service.
It really made my day.
Delicious inexpensive sushi with excellent service. 
My favorite items are \"Angry Tuna\" and \"3 Amigo\" with shrimp tempura and they are so addictive:)"}
{"text":"I will be back.  had the burrito on nori.  Wow was it good.  Great flavor from the spicy tuna, but could also taste the other fish.  Nice change from a sandwich.

I am not sure what I would do differently."}
{"text":"This place is good...different...I like that. Did feel very nauseous after eating it, probably because the fish is sitting out in Subway-esque containers waiting to be spooned into seaweed. My guess is if you go when they open and the fish just got put out, it would be much better. But the combos are good and the concept is creative."}
{"text":"Amazing idea! Fast sushi. Burrito sized rolls with lots of options. Fast yummy super filling. Watch this become an major chain."}
{"text":"I love that they have a set menu AND make your own burrito option! They were both delicious, and unless you just have completely dead taste buds, it's pretty hard to mess up a burrito! All the ingredients were fresh and light and very affordable considering its sushi. For those who are still working up to trying raw fish, they also have veggie, cooked meat/chicken options as well!"}
{"text":"So I placed an online order for 2 burritos the steak and egg and the triple s, and also three bowls the firecracker, the Santa Fe, and the lion king. 

My item was the firecracker bowl and I customized it to add baby spinach, mixed greens, pico, tempura crunch and guacamole ($.50). So I picked up my order and was excited to eat my bowl and I saw the ticket order taped to it. But once I opened the bowl up none of my added items were in the bowl!!!! No guacamole that I paid extra for. No greens, spinach, pico, or tempura crunch. I was kinda disappointed because I placed an online order clearly stating what I wanted in my bowl and none of that made it in there. It was still good nonetheless but I still wanted my items added in there. 

But in my moms bowl order the Santa Fe they got every single customized item in there so that seems like they just over looked my order still kinda disappointing. 

Don't think I'll be back there."}
{"text":"I loved this place. I can get my quick fix on sushi on the fly and not feel like I'm breaking the bank."}
{"text":"Ok, was it just me, or did everyone have a cold, chewy piece of shrimp tempura in their twin dragon? I've skimmed thru most of the reviews with it, and not 1 person has mentioned that? Is it supposed to be that way? It seemed like it had been cooked hours ago, was cold, oily, chewy, rubbery, no bueno. Cuz ive never been served cold tempura ever before at any sushi place! Eh, I usually get spicy tuna anyways, so 1 bad burrit won't change my mind.
Other than that, this place is fab. My fave out of all the sushi burrito joints. I like all the sauce options and how they're not skimpy with their scoops. I want to try a bowl, but I always manage to make up a burrito every time I go in. Staff is always super nice too."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today. I was not disappointed. This place a good healthy change of pace if your tired if the typical burger joint. It's also very affordable and you get your money's worth and you dont have to break the bank for a good meal. The staff was friendly and very patient as I looked over the menu. They have a variety of items that you can have either rolled into a burrito or in a bowl.They have a signature items as well as built your own bowl or burrito menu. I tried their cheesy steak bowl. It was really good. It was the perfect amount of food which is great if you have to go back to work.  Also, if you work at the Switch datacenters nearby they offer a 10% discount which makes it even more affordable for some. I was very happy with my meal and will make it a point to come here again for lunch."}
{"text":"Hands down THE BEST sushi burrito restaurant in Las Vegas. I've tried others, but nothing ever is as good as Soho's. The Twin Dragon is my favorite. They're always busy, so there isn't a time to go when you know no one is there, but the line goes quick."}
{"text":"Definitely recommend this place! Their employees were very nice and attentive. This was our first time here and the guy explained how everything works, you can either customize your sushi burrito, or pick one that is customized. The twin dragon burrito was soooooo good!!!"}
{"text":"Man oh man, this place is the King of Sushi Burritos! I tried this place for the first time last year and then thought it was amazing and decided to try it again in my hometown, Washington DC. Man did they fail over here. Then I went to PokeWorks, and that was a fail too. 

This place right here gives very generous portions of sushi so the fish to rice ratio is like 80/20. It's absolutely freakin' awesome! I took my friend's here for the first time and they were like I want to start a franchise! Lol

Anyway, real talk - this place is the spot for a quick sushi lunch, not to mention very affordable as well. I dislike how you can't order over the phone for a pickup though... please change that! (You can order online instead)"}
{"text":"Tried this place yesterday.  I had never tried sushi burrito before.  Pretty delicious- basically just one giant sushi roll- pretty filling!  I got the twin dragons and my husband got the high maintenance. 
They als"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and service is always great. I love the firecracker. It has the perfect amount of spicy and sushi. Obviously if you go during lunch hours expect a longer line. The firecracker is just under $6 and will keep you full. The rest of their speciality burritos can range from $6-12. You can also build your own bowl. Think of chipotle with sushi."}
{"text":"I was visiting Las Vegas and met a friend here for lunch as were both craving Japanese.  As soon as I walked in, I knew this had to be good cause the line was looong  I ordered the Twin Dragon in a bowl.  You can have it as a wrap with your choice of seaweed, rice paper or something else I can't remember.  I had mine as a bowl and it came with spicy ahi tuna and a lot of other flavors.  It is in a great location and the food is tasty and fresh."}
{"text":"I've eaten sushi burritos from this place maybe around 10 times but today, I got food poisoning. It wasn't any other food because I ate a granola bar in the morning and the sushi burrito was all I ate before this review. I threw up absolutely everything after having diarrhea. After throwing up I feel so much better but I don't know what more will follow."}
{"text":"I cannot get enough of this place. Super fresh fish and good price! Went there for the first time and the person was very patient explaining me how it worked. Should've gotten his name. Five stars for the food and service!"}
{"text":"Delicous. Got the High Maintenance with soy paper wrap. Added spicy mango sauce. It was such a rich mix of flavors. A bit crowded, but the line moved quickly."}
{"text":"I liked my sushi burrito a lot! It was delicious, but maybe missing a sauce or something to set it over the edge to 5 stars. It was yummy though and seemed like it'd be a great lunch place!"}
{"text":"Keeping it at 5 stars since it's so good for the price, but I do have one complaint. I come here pretty often and have for the last year or so - twice a month at the least but usually more. I've got quite the appetite as I usually don't get the chance to eat during the day, so I like to get 3 or 4 servings of fish. 

The problem? Apparently knowing how to count isn't exactly common sense anymore. One serving is three scoops, so if I order quadruple, I should end up with twelve, yeah? Nope, not here. I have to mention it literally every single time. You get charged extra for extra fish, which is completely fine - just give me what you're charging me for. Not a huge deal, but over the last year and easily 30+ visits, they've probably only done it right the first time once or twice.

Don't mean to rag on this place too hard cause it really is great otherwise - friendly employees, excellent quality food, and it's stupidly affordable. Strongly recommend, but seriously, learn to count."}
{"text":"Great new concept! LIke the new name vs. Jaburritos.

I have eaten at both the So Ho Restaurant and this new location So Ho Sushi Burrito.  So Ho Sushi Burrito food is always fresh and fast. The menu board let's you order a \"make your own\" entree as a bowl, tortilla or a nori/soy paper wrap. They also have suggestions for combos like the Santa Fe, Lion, etc.  We have been here a few times and have not had a bad meal even once.  Even if you are not a Sushi person, you can opt to have a chicken or beef wrap and be very happy with your food."}
{"text":"This is a cool place! We like everything they have. I ordered the lion king with the salmon in a bowl with the sushi rice & oh my it is so good!!! the salmon is fresh, everything is fresh... And the sauce complements each and every ingredients. We will definitely come back to this place over & over again!!!"}
{"text":"It's really really good. Kind of pricey but really good lol.
Staff is super friendly, people must like it as much as I do because it been full everytime I've been here. Everything is made right in front of you just like subway, except way better because sushi!"}
{"text":"Seriously, this place is great! Burritos or bowls. Fresh fish and creative combinations or build you own. Next time we are in Vegas, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Can't get enough of Twin Dragon and Triple S... this is the first sushi burrito   Spot I went to a couple years ago and this place and the sister spot on Sahara I think, never let me down"}
{"text":"Although this place is tucked into a strip mall on Sahara and has too small a space crammed with too many tables, I really enjoy it.  Essentially the name says it all. Sushi style food (tuna, shrimp tempura, soft shell crab, and other fish mostly raw) are rolled up in a burrito style, somewhat like a giant hand roll.  You can order one of their pre-designed combinations or create your own. The rolls are stuffed and are very filling and reasonably priced between $5 and $13.00.
We have happily worked this into our lunch rotation."}
{"text":"The giant sushi burritos are terrific! Very filling and tasty. Such a great concept in a fun and friendly atmosphere. A must try!"}
{"text":"I would love to post this review, and say all the good things that some of these other kind folks had to say, but...let me start by saying, we came as a group...ate as a group, and suffered as a group. We had been here before with no issues. How were we to know the utter horrors that lay before us? The unknown evil, that stirs the deepest of pains, sweat, maybe some blood, and definitely a few tears...all of us, the lot, whole herd, gaggle...we all got it. Whatever the hell it was, it literally took days to recover from. There was enough of us that got sick, the Health District took interest...won't be back, ever..."}
{"text":"Sushi Burrito? Of course, it exists! I love the setup of this place as it reminds me faintly of a Chipotle-like fashion only with sushi, burritos and bowls! I've been to other sushi burrito places but this is the only place that I know of where it actually has a DIY option. 

1) You get to choose: bowl? Nachos? Burrito?
2) Add your proteins!
3) Add your toppings and sauce!

There's also some premade items on the menu for you to choose from as well. We got the twin dragon, which comes with shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, surimi crab, lettuce, crispy wonton strips, unagi sauce and sweet chipotle mayo. I opted for the DIY so I got salmon, yellowtail, chipotle mayo, baby spinach, cilantro, cucumbers, roasted corn and cream cheese. You can also mix and match different sauces if you like (without an extra charge!)

Overall, both our burritos tasted really great. Prices are good too for what you pay for. I would definitely come here again! Credit cards accepted and there's plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Genius.  Take the pomp and the high price away from sushi and here you go.

You can choose a burrito from their combinations or select your own ingredients.  They have lotsa options. 

The burritos are like over stuffed sushi rolls.  The burritos have only a thin layer of rice and generous servings of fish in the middle.  You can also choose what type of vegetables and sauces go in your sushi burrito.

I had the angry tuna.  It was tasty.  Also tried the taro chips.  They were tasty.

Fast service and the prices were fair.  It is a small place and it was very crowded. 

I can not think of any reason why not to love this place."}
{"text":"I ordered the Twin Dragon but with Ahi Tuna instead of Spicy Tuna. It was very good! I do wish it had had avocado slices instead of guacamole, but I guess I'm trying to take the Mexican out of the fusion... I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"If you're a sushi lover and gluten free, this place is for you! Very knowledgable about both gluten free and vegan options, complete with separate menu! Staff very willing to help and patient. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"I'm 50/50 on this place.

One one hand the fish is fresh, the sauces are tasty and the service is decent, but on the other hand they charge extra for everything, the cucumber is gross with the seeds and skin, and the pre-packed ginger and wasabi is foul. 

I'll still probably eat here every once and awhile, but much better sushi bowl places out there."}
{"text":"The food is delicious. Ordered delivery, and the dishes arrived fresh and tasty. \"High maintenance\" satisfied the seafood eater, while \"Santa Fe\" made the non fish eater want more. It would've been 5 star rating, if the requested (also paid for) wasabi aioli sauce on the side was included."}
{"text":"the bomb. i really like the freshness and the cleanliness and the workers there. it's worth the drive there. i like the for cracker and customized my roll abit. i like their spicy tuna. it's a bit salty? but maybe it's the sauce idk. i also tried their triple S... so fulfilling and totally can filled you for the day! definitely will be back and try other rolls. the price is right and it's so good. check it out & taste it for yourself"}
{"text":"First sushi burrito I ate was from here. Was heading home to Cali where no places like these exist, only poke joints. I was deciding between the Triple S and Caterpillar so the guy suggested the first one only if I was really hungry, which I wasn't. Caterpillar it was and I really enjoyed it. Subbed cream cheese with seaweed salad. Wasn't too big but it packed good flavors with the eel and chipotle sauces. I saw everyone posting on the Triple S so sometimes it's good to try something different from everyone else. I'd come back to try another in the future."}
{"text":"This place is friendly, clean, reasonably priced, and good. Only downfall is long line on 2 for 1 Fridays."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised at how amazing the quality of the ingredients tasted! I ordered a custom sushi burrito with seaweed wrapper, rice, tempura shrimp, spicy tuna, mixed greens, cucumbers, tempura crunch, green onions, and spicy mayo & eel sauce (unagi). 

The place was very inviting and surprisingly not that busy (every time I've gone there's a line out the door). The first guy that built my burrito was very helpful with choosing what sauce will suit the burrito I got. I'm so glad I didn't end up only getting poke sauce.

Overall, a MUST TRY in Vegas. They also have bowls and nachos available."}
{"text":"Second time in for lunch. Fast service great food and good value. I like burritos and love sushi this place is definitely a solid lunch choice from the normal \"lunch\" items. Added bonus it's healthy."}
{"text":"Yes one of my things to do every time I'm coming from LA! It's my favorite food in Vegas it's so good it's so fresh and the staff is amazing.
You never tried I say go and do it you won't regret a minute.
I even got most off my coworker addicted to that now"}
{"text":"I got this place recommended by my boss and I have that a try. Omg so good sushi burrito I'm afraid I can't do regular sushi again.
One thing I know is I need to eat this again before I'm going back to LA.

Customer service: I wish the staff was a bit more friendly the reason I say it because it's was my first time yesterday and didn't know how it works or how many options yo can choose they didn't explain.
Then when I asked about what kind of sauce/dressing they had one of the employee was like look up on the menu.

The reason I give 5 stars is because the burrito is good not for the service.
Service I will give it 3 of 5 they can do better by explaining."}
{"text":"This star earns my number one spot for sushi. The firecracker sushi is bomb and is da best spicy ahi sushi up in Vegas I tried so far. Finally moved by here from Henderson so this is gonna be my daily eats. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who loves genki sushi back in Hawaii and for sure will know dat this place won't disappoint! The environment is great even for kids the menu is easy to see and best part is you can even build your own sushi burrito to your likings. The flavors are so fresh that you don't need to worry about getting sick like some other places I know. Try this place out and you will be overly satisfied GAURENZ!!!!!"}
{"text":"I had no idea this place was owned by Soho Sushi. I first visited this place when it was called Jaburritos. I understand the name was changed to keep things uniform with the sushi place on the other end of town. The names of the rolls changed but the ingredients were the same. When they were Jaburritos, I had the Redondo which is now called The Three Amigos. When I went after they changed names to Soho Sushi Burrito, I got the Twin Dragon and added on the taro chips and cheese dip (served in a brown paper bag). Nice portions and pretty filling. You can substitute the nori wrap for soy wrap, if you desire. You can also create your own sushi burrito with lots of different options to choose from. The price leans more towards the pricier side but I'm fine with that. I love this latest trend of fusing Japanese and Mexican together creating these sushi burritos. As of the time of this review, the strip mall area they are located in is undergoing some storefront remodeling. Just look for the sign on the scaffolding. They do tend to get pretty busy during the peak lunch and dinner hours. If you can hit the place up earlier or later, you won't have to wait as long."}
{"text":"The food isn't all that great. I like fusion food but eating a sushi version of a burrito isn't a good idea when you actually bite into it. My friend hyped me to come here and I like the facility and the way the presentation is it but I had a hard time finishing my first half due to the weird flavors and unusual taste. I ended up opening the sushi wrap and just eating the spicy tuna and yellowtail by itself. I rather order a regular sushi roll. I'm normally not a picky eater but this is one of the few times I really couldn't finish my meal. Wonder how people can really enjoy this place. Not likely to come back"}
{"text":"Went in today to get a bowl & a sushi burrito. THANK YOU , for those who gave me such wonderful service. I appreciate you! I'm so happy that Soho is so close to my job! YASS! 

Food and the taro chips all amazingly delicious. However for my bowl , I felt like the brown rice could of been more softer. BUT , I still enjoyed me food."}
{"text":"Genius idea!! I wish we had one of these in Sacramento. 
The blending of sushi and Mexican food was a match made in heaven. 

They come with pre-made combinations for anyone daunted, but they're all fully customizable. Amazing variety of ingredients. And they have some authentically foreign drinks and desserts to sample and enjoy. 

I got the High Maintenance, minus wonton strips, plus cilantro and pico - and added on some Miso soup and JayOne Aloe Drink. Thoroughly enjoyed it, but after trying my friend's twin dragon, I wish I'd gone for that one instead. 
Highly recommend the aloe drink. =)

They also have a wide variety of ice cream mochi: mango, green tea, coffee, black sesame - along with the usual vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry"}
{"text":"First time here, and it was no disappointment!  We made our own burrito for $8, using 2 proteins- crab meat and shrimp tempura.  We added a variety of onions, cilantro, corn, cucumber, a couple of sauces- unagi and chiptole mayo, and added some won ton crunchies.  It wasn't stuffed that much, so it was fairly easy for them to roll.  It tasted really good.  I can't wait to go eat another one when we go back to Vegas!  Next time, I wanna put in some unagi... didn't see it the first time."}
{"text":"Nestled in a developing strip mall on Jones and 215 sits Soho Sushi Burrito, a highly addictive place for sushi lovers.  First trip to Soho Sushi Burrito and I chose the 3 Amigos burrito with brown rice.  Server packed it with plenty of salmon, yellowtail and tuna plus the rest of the fixings.  Very delicious sushi burrito and the perfect portion for my hunger.  A friend of mine had ordered double protein before and wouldn't recommend it since it requires another piece of seaweed and makes the burrito difficult to eat.  Second trip to Soho Sushi Burrito I tried the twin dragon roll but didn't enjoy it as much as the 3 Amigos, probably due to the shrimp tempura and imitation crab mixture.  I prefer the fresh sushi taste in every bite of a sushi burrito.  I happened to be on a diet my third trip to Soho Sushi Burrito and did a 3 Amigos bowl/salad and it was a very delicious low carb alternative to the burritos.

I enjoyed the super friendly and outgoing staff working at Soho Sushi Burrito that gives an awesome cheer when tipped at the end and the food was awesome!"}
{"text":"Very nice place!
I took my own sushi bowl and it was big enough (with extra protein), the fish and all other ingredients were fresh. The Service was good as well, nice people and the place was very clean - which is very important !"}
{"text":"Cute vibe inside. Clean.  Fresh. Big portion. I wish every item I would like in my bowl was not an additional .50 but whatevs.

Jaburritos is better in my humble opinion."}
{"text":"My mom really wanted to try this place bc we been to jaburritos and it was poppin. I've reviewed   Jaburritos too so go read it and compliment it LOL. Anyways i liked this place, i liked the service bc they were really nice and asked us if it was our first time and alla dat. I was going to give 4 stars because there was no pokestop here lol jk i didnt check but really tho i was going to give 4 stars bc i didnt like my burrito that much but i made my own burrito.. Like i chose everything that went inside and it was kinda dry so i think that was my own fault LOL! But I liked it enough that im willing to come back and try their other stuff! My moms burrito was pretty good and she got twin dragon. Im just glad that sushi burritos are becoming more popular like yass i love dat cultural diversity."}
{"text":"I went here the other day for the first time. Everyone was super friendly and helpful on giving recommendations! Our food was delicious! We'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"My favorite place ever! I love this location and the one inside of UNLV! They are always so welcoming and awesome! Even if they're busy they're always calm and nice! I would recommend the Caterpillar!"}
{"text":"Sushi + Burrito = AWESOME. This place is amazing. The line was a little long, but well worth the wait. Think Chipotle but with Sushi. You can either customize your order or order a premade combination off the menu. I ordered the Triple S. It has spicy tuna, soft shell crab and surimi crab for like $11. Everything was good."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is great, from freshness of food to customer service every time I come into town I always come to this place to have poke. You won't regret coming to this place and giving it s try"}
{"text":"Delicious! Like a sushi subway. Except better. Quick service and well priced. I love eel so the caterpillar was perfect"}
{"text":"This is the second place I've had a sushi burrito at. The burrito here was good I had the three amigos. It wasn't great. There's some tough competition in the area with JaBurrito and Ted's sushi burrito nearby. The lady behind the counter didn't know seaweed was nori. The burrito lacked any real flavor. The cilantro and little orange beads had great flavor but came and went all too soon. Fish tasted fine but I'm still trying out a few places to find out who the best sushi burrito is on this side of town."}
{"text":"This place has been on my list for a while, and now I'm thinking, \"What the eFF was I waiting for?!\"

This place is incredible - think fresh sushi served at a fast food assembly line pace. 

It's like you want a quick and healthy sushi meal but without the hassle of sitting down and waiting on service. Before Soho, the idea of fast food sushi never sounded appealing because of the freshness factor. Here, what they do is have the fresh ingredients in front of you as you put together a custom meal or choose from one of their premade selections.

On this visit, instead of a custom, tried two signature Sushi Burritos: Twin Dragon (shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, crab, guac, chipotle mayo) & 3 Amigos (ahi tuna, yellowtail, salmon).  Of the two, I can't say one was better than the other - both so delicious.  

Twin Dragons ($10.50) got a nice kick from the mayo and spicy tuna, as well as more of a crunch texture from the tempura.  Meanwhile, I loved the 3 Amigos ($10.95) for having the variety of proteins and still being able to have a clean and light flavor - it didn't at all feel heavy after finishing the whole thing. 

I'll be coming back and to try more burritos and have again, the all-day Sapporo happy hour ($3 draft from the Katana sword handle) 

My only suggestion is to do something about the dining area - place gets so packed on the weekend! We almost went to eat in the car"}
{"text":"Great food! I loved this place! You can get iut in a bowl or in a burrito style,  worth it. Quick line management,  didn't have to wait long."}
{"text":"Great place, enjoyed the sushi burrito so much here. I had a sushi burrito one other time but felt it was mostly rice I was eating. This one, however, was stuffed with lots of fish and all the extras. Every bite was packed with sushi and sauce and sides. They have a lot to pick from so I was a little overwhelmed and decided to go with the 3 amigos to get a taste of all three fish. It was a great choice! We came in by noon and the line started to form behind us but they love very fast. This was lunch on a Thursday."}
{"text":"Tried the high Maintanace...it was really good and fresh. Staff was energetic and great"}
{"text":"I ate here today and tried four different menu items. The twin dragon. Which is amazing. The firecracker. Which felt like a cheaper version of the twin dragon (and actually is cheaper) . The triple s. Pretty good lots of flavor (possibly the best) . And the cheesy Asada. Which was better than I expected. The service was quick and somewhat friendly and it's the price isn't bad at all for what you are getting . Also try the mango cream soda,It's so good"}
{"text":"I love this place!!! Even though I'm not familiar with asian food, I really addicted eating sushi Britto."}
{"text":"Stopped by here on my lunch.  I love how these spots (sushi burrito) keep popping up all over town!  This one is closer to the strip, so if you're in town visiting, this is for you. Parking can be a little crazy but it is worth it. 

By far one of the tastiest here in Vegas.  The sushi was so fresh, many different options, and service was helpful.  I wanted to switch it up and he broke the menu down for me.  He recommend the Tiger roll.  If you have no idea what to order (like me most of the time) I highly recommend asking for recommendations."}
{"text":"Very good burritos but it did take longer than I thought to make and I was anxious to get over to my friends. Food was very good and I'm excited to try it again next time I'm on that side of town."}
{"text":"The food is awesome.  You cannot beat the quality and quantity for the price.  The gap that Soho fills is that you can go for a quick sushi lunch and be back to work as quickly as if you had gone to a fast food restaurant (though if going at peak lunch times I recommend ordering online because they do get extemely busy).  

I wish they had more seating!"}
{"text":"Pretty good. But lots of Poke/ Sushi Burrito places popping up. I'll go out of my way to get to this location because of the Taro chips (regular). Try it, you might like it."}
{"text":"This place makes Sushi burritos with your choice of seaweed or rice paper. Everything is freshly made right in front of you. You can order from the menu or create your own sushi burrito or nachos. The establishment looked clean and staff were very helpful. Going in for the first time was a tad overwhelming because there are so many choices. So try the triple S, you won't be disappointed. Oh and the taro chips are bomb!!"}
{"text":"YUMMMMMMMMMM!!! I loved my sushi burrito here so much! Fresh fish, nice topping selection, and yummy sauces. Not stingy with toppings and not too much up-charging for \"specialty\" toppings. Everything was super super tasty. Definitely coming here again when the sushi burrito craving hits!"}
{"text":"The service we received here was very good.   The guys behind the counter were friendly and engaging and very patient with us.  We ordered quite a bit and they didn't seem annoyed one bit (can't say that about the people behind us in line.)

 You can order one of their specialties or build your own custom sushi burrito.   They have a lot of different options and toppings which is much appreciated.   I really liked their side bar with soy sauce, wasabi, etc.   They also gave a large variety of sides to choose from.  We got the furikake taro chips.   Good but a little hard to eat as the chips are very think.   The cheese sauce they come with is pretty good if not a little boring. 

My problem was that the sushi burrito seemed pretty flavorless.  We tried the 3 amigos, angry tuna, a California, and a salmon bowl.   Of the 3 three salmon bowl had the most flavor (but we also still had to add quite a bit of soy sauce.)

I don't know if we'll be back.   We'll probably try quite a few more places first."}
{"text":"My friend and I managed to beat the crowd when we arrived and the service was really friendly. Ordered the Twin Dragon and it was yummy, I would definitely recommend it. Big sushi fan and the burrito really hit the spot for me. Only downside was that the burrito wasn't properly rolled, so it was really messy to eat."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I tried UberEATS today for lunch because we get a $10 off our first purchase, I suggested trying Soho (ordered to them last night too) because their sushi burrito were bomb! Most of our team ordered and they did not disappoint!! They were amazing and even hooked it up with free edamame and seaweed salad! They packed in our burrito and our bowl! I personally got the bowl myself. The bowl was heavily packed!!! My coworkers and my supervisor were very happy! You guys are amazing! Thank you for giving us an amazing lunch! Shout to my supervisor ate Eden to making it happen! we'll be making another order!!!! Ahaha"}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool! The concept is great, and it's a must try for sushi lovers. I have only been here once, but I'd love to come back again. I always imagined this concept and thought it would be amazing, but somehow I am still a fan of traditional, bite sized, sushi."}
{"text":"We walked in after a long day at a cheer competition to find great service and delicious food and drink! The sushi burritos are huge and I still don't know how they roll it up and seal it. Then they put it in a cool machine that tightens it even more so it's not spilling out all over the place."}
{"text":"I was so excited to have a Sushi Burrito place open because I have been hitting up a California food truck that comes to town for the foodie fest with the same concept for years now. I also love their other restaurant Soho Sushi. In my mind Soho SushiBurrito had all the potential in the world but they fell short, way short. It may be that I have already decided exactly how the perfect Sushi Burrito should taste, and the options were too far from what I'm used to. Maybe it was that I felt the quality of the ingredients were not the same quality as their other store. Maybe it was a combination of the two but I feel the taste and quality were lacking.

I will admit, I may be a one off because even during construction going on at the strip mall they were packed with people who all seemed to be enjoying themselves. I will probably give them another chance because I really wanted to love it but at this point the review is of disappointment."}
{"text":"Five star sushi burrito! Only complaint I ever have with sushi burritos at all places is when you bite it, you don't get the full flavor. I wish they would compile ingredients in a bowl then wrap in burrito. Other than that this place rocks!"}
{"text":"When i don't feel like sitting down for AYCE sushi, but would like some sushi in a handy burrito, I go to this place! prepared fresh right in front of you and i get it to go before i work! The food is great, no complaint and the staff are all nice. The only downside is probably the space. They could use more chairs when you feel like meeting up for lunch with a friend."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!!! I had the triple s in seaweed...was soooooo good...cant wait to go back"}
{"text":"Really nice mixture of both worlds! Only suggestion is to mix up your meats half and half. The taste can get a little overwhelming especially if you are use sushi rolls where you get a new taste every few bites."}
{"text":"I love walking into this place. They literally shout when you walk-in, leave a tip, it's kind of my favorite thing. I'm not entirely sure if the staff is as into the greeting as they seem but that's a good thing! I love their shouting enthusiasm. I'm not always greeted as warm when they are building my bowl or sushi burrito but I will take what I can get. 90% of the time the guys and gals behind the glass genuinely ask how my day is going and that's a real nice thing to do.

They have quite a large amount of offerings from steak and tempura shrimp to chipotle mayo and queso. That's right. They have queso. I watched the guy ahead of me build his own bowl with steak, queso, and all the fixings. He was a genius. This time around I ordered myself the FIRECRACKER: Spicy Tuna, Cucumber, Lettuce, Cabbage, Crispy Wonton Strips, Sweet Chipotle Mayo, Honey. It's packed with flavor and wild with texture. I opted for the soy paper this time and it was quite nice. This was my favorite roll so far. I had the 3 Amigos last time and it wasn't my favorite.

The Taro Chips are a must. I love how crunchy they are and the three flavor options are nom-nom. My favorite is the furikake flavor and a major bonus is that is comes with a small side of queso for dipping. That's right, I said it again. Queso.

This is affordable, filling, and really delicious."}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool. They have a machine that compacts the rice into large squares. Then they put different fish inside and roll it like a burritos. It's a great place for the money."}
{"text":"The concept was great but I believe for the popularity of this idea, it was poorly executed.
The food itself, yeah it's good!
The service on the other hand, not so much.
The line where the food was being prepared was just a little messy and all over the place.
They've only been open for a few months so they may get better in time. 

Another concern that I had was that it was difficult to choose from their vast amount of toppings. It would've been easier to pick if their were labels directly on the glass (similar to Subway) 
Easy to see. Easy to choose. Simple!

My husband made his own sushi burrito and I decided to make my own nachos - which I was pretty disappointed with the chicken. It was flavorless and tasted like it came out of a frozen package... It would've been much better if it were a katsu chicken or a marinaded and grilled chicken (similar to Mochiko's grilled chicken).

In this case, it's true to not go to a sushi burrito place and order chicken nachos!

All in all, not too bad and good prices.

Next time I'll come back and order one of their more popular and recommended choices!"}
{"text":"Good food, but long wait for the food. MY boyfriend and I tried to go later like 7:30 for dinner...We waited for half an hour before we ordered. Food was phenomenal, so it was worth the wait! :)"}
{"text":"Wow. First time eating here and I was super impressed. Great pricing, food is fresh and service is fast. Definitely coming back and recommending to all my friends who eat sushi. My 4 yo loves the shrimp tempura for kids and I tried the twin dragon. Can't wait to try everything else."}
{"text":"I was craving this place cause the first time i ate here i was like wow. It was really good.
Today i was very disappointed. We bought 2 sushi buritto. Both with spicy tuna. It was way to salty. I'm in the culinary industry and consistency in taste n texture is important. I dont think I'll come back here."}
{"text":"I love the sushi burrito and bowl! I've tried the twin dragon for both. The only reason why I'm knocking it down 1 star is for its side items. I ordered a seaweed salad and the serving size was really small, it was probably just as much as I would've got had I just added it to the burrito for ($.50)"}
{"text":"Everything was so fresh!  Loved their suggested menu recipes. A huger variety of options.  Couldn't decide so split 2 different burritos with my daughter. We had twin dragon and caterpillar. 

We tried the taro chips in original and a side of edimami. 

Employees were so patient with us in explaining anything we asked. 

Very clean restaurant too

For sure would go back.....like tomorrow!"}
{"text":"I'm prayin' that they open another location by my house.  Great tasting food, fresh and healthy too!"}
{"text":"Please see review for place previously known as \"JaBurrito\" :)
Love the sushi burrito concept, and the fish here is pretty fresh! Come early, it still takes some time to get through the made-to-order line!"}
{"text":"Ordered online and it was waiting for me when I walked in. My \"burrito\" which is more of a large hand roll was delicious! I ordered the 3 amigos and added cream cheese. Could have done without the Pico and added more sauce, but I guess getting my order perfect will come with more trial and error. Will definitely be back to try more of the menu. No actual complaints other than I wish there were more around town!"}
{"text":"Always hits the spot! Great for when im craving sushi but don't have money/time for all you can eat. Or if I don't have anyone to eat with I just get it to go.  I love making my own burrito!"}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with sushi burrito! Soho is the best in town. The staff is great."}
{"text":"Oh it's so good! I'm still new to the whole poke and sushi burrito fad that has been going on lately, but I think that this is one of my favorite places so far. A lot of the negative reviews are from people that has had poke from Hawaii and so forth. I hate that people are comparing it to that, because we all know that the best foods come from wherever they originate from. For a bowlritto spot in the middle of a desert, it is pretty freaking good. 

The staff are awesome. They are super friendly and accommodating to the newbies. They explain to you the whole process. The prices are not bad either! I have had the high maintenance and the three amigos and they are both really good. They are generous with their poke, so you are definitely getting your money's worth.

I highly recommend trying this place out!"}
{"text":"Soho....Soooo good! I cannot get enough of this place. The sushi burritos are tasty and I'm addicted to their taro chips! Sin sauce...i could live without the sauce. I've been there a few times and tried various items from when they were JaBurritos, mainly when they were JaBurritos and their menu seems to have changed so I can't really talk about the menu items then but I did try the Santa Fe which was a bit spicy but I'm trying to build up my tolerance so this definitely helped with that. The ingredients were so fresh and my roll was easy to consume. It's big enough to keep me filled but not put me into a food coma. Watching them prepare my food and being able to call the shots is a nice way to put my mind at ease as far as trusting kitchen staff. The staff is always friendly and will to accommodate. Lunch time is a beast and I am warning you be prepared to wait. Every time I go on my lunch I am met with a line and a wait of over 20 mins. Luckily for me, my office is 5 minutes away so I still have time to enjoy my roll. Prices are reasonable as well. I always opt for the combo with chips and drink because again I AM ADDICTED TO THEIR TARO CHIPS. Definitely a healthier option than In-N-Out, McDonalds and cheaper than Landrys."}
{"text":"I came to eat here with friends for dinner, opting to pass on the heavy AYCE and enjoy a filling sushi burrito. I got the three amigos which was delicious, hit the spot of both salmon and tuna w yellow tail I think it was. Also got some miso which was alright, not very warm but tasted good, also tried the taro chips w cheese sauce and it was so flavorful I will definitely get those next time. Had some Sapporo and ended the night happy and satisfied. The place was busy all while we were there line was rarely down to two people at least, but despite the wait it's so worth it. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I was so skeptical about this, but have been handily proven wrong - twice.  Fresh, delicious combinations, and this menu is literally for everyone - sushi lovers, sushi non-lovers, vegans, veggies, gluten-freebies, and the carnivorous.  

I've had a bowel each time, and love how everything tastes.  The Mango soy sauce is deeeeeeelicious, and that's the best shrimp tempura too!  The taro chips are also fantastic.  The lines are long, but hang in there.  The staff work quickly and the food is worth it!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge sushi burrito fan and this is my all time favorite place. I've tried multiple in town and this is by far the best! They roll them up perfectly so they don't fall apart and they're always a good size ! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Kind of a gimmicky place, but not bad.  Fish is fresh."}
{"text":"So happy I tried this place! It's close to work and the delivery was super quick way before the eta. The boba Thai tea was perfect and the sushi burrito I ordered was amazing. I will for sure be ordering again. They make it so easy to place your order online and have it delivered plus the food was amazing. I'm hooked!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and I keep coming back! Food is delicious, I like to build my own bowl. Food is fresh, staff is attentive, helpful and friendly :). This place is packed around lunch time. It's a healthier option and I always leave satisfied, portions are generous too! I'll keep coming back for this deliciousness"}
{"text":"With just a few more hours in Vegas, my husband and I realized we hadn't had any seafood yet on our trip. How tragic! As we scanned Yelp for nearby ideas, Soho came up as a suggestion and would fulfill our desire for fresh sushi and another fab food craze item, a sushiritto!

It was fun to watch the sushirittos be made. There's a full-on machine that presses the sushi race into a square seaweed wrapper! At the end, there's another machine that tightly wraps the sushiritto, which is a good thing since the people putting together our sushirittos were generous with the toppings. I wasn't sure how it was all going to fit!

I opted for the High Maintenance, and it was awesome. Mmm, I can still taste the fresh yellowtail, spicy tuna, and guacamole. What a brilliant combination! The cabbage and wonton crackers added a great crunch, as well. I really couldn't have picked a better option. (Tim M. got the Twin Dragon, which he swears was better, but we'll have to agree to disagree.)

SSB was one of the best culinary decisions of our whole trip. You should definitely go for it."}
{"text":"I love coming here when I'm craving a sushi burrito or bowl. I've tried many places that are similar and by far this has been the best place and most convenient since it's so close to home. 

It's tucked away in the corner of Jones and badura, but the inside is nice. There are some Seats available for dining. 

Everything I've tried so far has been really good and my husband loves to get the taro chips along with whatever he decides to get. The staff has always been very friendly whenever we come here."}
