{"text":"Stopped in on a whim instead of walking by as per usual - and SO glad I did.  The whole menu sounds good, so I started simply with the chicken O.G. and figured I'd expand from there if I loved it.
So simply stated: It's FANTASTIC!  I intended to take a photo, but my gyro was gone before I could grab my camera.  Priorities...

Behind the counter they're very friendly and happy to talk gyros with you.  I also love that clean and polished as the establishment is, it's not a chain, just an honest local Canadian business.  If you care about those sorts of things, then you can feel even better about eating here.  And if you don't...well you can still feel good about eating here because the food's Delicious!"}
{"text":"I used to live very close to this place and would go in so regularly that the crew there knew my order and started on it right away when I got in, even when there was a line ahead of me (on some occasions) I'd have my food ready for me by the time I got up to the cash where the super sweet cashiers were always very friendly. I find it rare that one leaves a fast food place feeling uplifted, but this place genuinely has that positive vibe to it!

The prices were reasonable and the sweet chili sauce on the \"Turn Up\" Gyro is VERY very good. If you're in the area, definitely give them a try!"}
{"text":"Cheap, yet very tasty. Quick, but it fills you up. I wasn't expecting much when I first went to 'The Original Gyro Grill', hell I couldn't even pronounce the name. What I found was one of the greatest lunch joints. Not only did they have chicken (my favourite), they even had pork and beef. I was amazed at the tastiness of the gyro and the fries were crispy and warm. I will return for more."}
{"text":"Highly recommended and satisfying!! A must try!! Absolutely adored the friendly staff :) offered excellent advice based on my food preference and hit it out of the ballpark!! They really provide a flavorful variety to suit anyone's taste, whatever meat or fixings you're into, they're bound to deliver.  Bravo!!!"}
{"text":"Best gyros in town. Better than Messini! Try lamb, chicken or pork. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Pretty big portion, as others have said, pork meat is on the dry side, and very greasy, but will fill you up. I ordered chicken solvaki as well, pretty average, I tasted better in Athens. Overall I like it, but will only come back when I'm REALLY hungry!"}
{"text":"Very tasty gyro poutine! Good gravy and good fries! Just wish they had curds instead of feta."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. It's a family owned fast food Greek joint with cheaper prices than a similar establishment around the corner... Really, I tried. I gave it a second try. Then a third try, against my better judgement. But, just no... the food is not fresh. Pitas are stale. Meat tastes old. They run out of food constantly and always seem overwhelmed... I really wanted to be a fan, but I'm just not. It's really not good."}
{"text":"I honestly do not know what the hype is about. To be fair, I've only been here once. Thus, this review is for what I ordered only..

The restaurant itself was small. Gyro is served on a silver platter, lined with waxed paper. 

I ordered a lamb gyro, which was around $9. The lamb was BONE DRY. The was literally no moist parts of the lamb in the gyro. Try at your own risk!!

If you choose to come, do not order the lamb gyro. Perhaps you should try the chicken or pork, as the other reviewers suggested. But I will not be returning to this location any time soon..."}
{"text":"Awesome Gyros!

Our quality of life increased significantly after this place opened. Love Gyros and that trek over to the Danforth is quite a ways from the Annex... Now don't have to do that anymore.

The food (mainly the Gyros) is awesome: the Pitas are just right and the Gyro Dinner is quite literally enough food for two people (often we get the dinner just to share). I'm very much hoping this place will stay. 

Note: come for the food, NOT the ambience. It's not really a dine-in place (though you can), I recommend doing take-out."}
{"text":"Great food. Good portions. A little pricey but good quality food and friendly staff."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!

Have ordered the regular gyros, the salads, and the full dinners. Portions are always great in terms of size! The flavours are on point. When you order a dinner everything is packed up nicely, the salad is HEFTY and uses proper lettuce, not that half-dead feeble iceberg stuff you'd get a lot at places. The meat is juicy and feels fresh, the pita is warm which is a nice touch. 

Staff is super friendly and makes good suggestions. 

Critical is that you can find a variety of options for varying dietary needs (gluten free/vegetarian/etc). A welcome addition to the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Had the beef gyro with fries in it for takeout, and it was okay. I found the gyro dry with the meat on top and all the tzatziki on the bottom. Service was mediocre as it seems like they were just opening up for the day."}
{"text":"Get \"The Turn Up\".  An awesome modern take on a typical chicken Gyro.  It's got Chipotle mayo, arugula, caramelized onions, topped with yam fries.  The more standard options are average but The Turn Up is amazing.  One other thing, if you're deciding between this and the crowded but horrible Burrito Bandidos joint next door there is no comparison.  Better customer service and unlike their competition you can tell they actually care about the food. Key cheap food spot in the annex."}
{"text":"Food is super good and consistent, always craving more. Thank you OG Grill for making the best tasting gyros in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Very good gyros etc, fast, affordable. Also the people who work there are lovely. This is exactly the kind of place this area needed."}
{"text":"Ordered their OG chicken it was alright.
I am not sure about others but I felt very thristy after eating, I did ordered soft drink with it and finish the whole bottle.  Once in a while it's okay."}
{"text":"Really good place for Greek food. The food is delicious, portions are big and the price is I suppose good for suck quality. I definitely recommend it, but don't go there too much or you'll get super fat"}
{"text":"This place opened up recently and I was just passing by and thought I'd try their food with my girlfriend. She ordered the Calamari and I ordered the lamb gyros. Both were delicious and were a generous portion. The meat was tender and had the perfect flavors. Service was wonderful and the people are very friendly. Definitely my new favorite Greek Place"}
{"text":"Been here a bunch of times and am always impressed with the value for money. I used to go to the burrito place next door, but find the food here much tastier when I need a quick bite. The 'loaded gun' and 'turn up' are my favorites.

Portions are solid and the meat always tastes fresh. So glad this place came to the annex!

They recently started serving burgers as well which I'll be trying shortly."}
{"text":"Ahhhh I wish I didn't discover this place, I'm going to crave it so hard and it's not close to my home!  The chicken on the og with tzatziki tasted like it was freshly taken off a cooked chicken. So fresh! I absolutely love this place."}
{"text":"Not bad!  Uninspiring and bit rude service. Tasted just ok. If your not willing to go to greektown and your hankering for a gyro, this place will do."}
{"text":"Great gyro! I live in NYC and came to Toronto for a conference. I don't know about other greek restaurants in town but the gyro in this place is far better than any gyro I've had in New York! Tried both the pork gyro and the chicken one and they were delicious. Met the owner too, he's a very friendly dude who tries, as he said, to serve the same gyro as if it was made in Greece. Hence the name of the place I suppose..."}
{"text":"This place used to have some very good gyro, but it seems management has changed, or at least I see a bunch of new faces working there, and the food is just not the same anymore. I had a lamb gyro salad. The dressing went from really good to terrible, or hey just put way too much of it on the salad. The meat was cut way too thick and just didn't have that delicious lamb taste it used to have. The food quality went from above average to below. Overall, I wouldn't bother going anymore. Toronto has too many good food choices."}
{"text":"I'm at a loss for words the food at this place is beyond incredible. The chef was friendly cashier had a little attitude. I will be back though I ordered a lamb OG and this was the best thing I have ever tested in my life. It was so good I tried the calamari gyro and yet again one of the best things I've tasted in my life. Go here and you will not be disappointed I promise."}
{"text":"I've checked out The Original Gyro Grills on 2 separate occasions, but both before class and questioning how hungry I actually was (the correct answer: I am always hungry.)

Restaurant size:
It's got a few tables, and is definitely larger when compared with its neighbour Burrito Bandidos. However, you may still wish to have your meal to-go.

Food quality:
The first time I visited, I had the Loaded Gun (chicken & pork, yam & regular fries, OG & tzatziki sauce). Poor choice, as it was a huge mess to eat. The pork was incredibly dry, and the OG sauce is straight up nasty. I did not heed the warnings of other patrons: DON'T ACCEPT THE OG SAUCE! A GYRO ISN'T THE PLACE FOR HONEY MUSTARD-LIKE TASTES. And, holy Batman the grease!? It's like it was oozing out of the wrapper...

The second visit, I had the OG chicken with tzatziki. Less messy, somewhat less dry (still dry) but still greasy... Maybe even moreso? I have absolutely no enjoyment eating these gyros, mainly because of the messiness of it all.

Service:
Very straightforward; you place order at register, you pay, you wait for food, you receive food, you leave. Your experience may change if you are dining in.

Final thoughts:
If you're desperate for a gyro or Greek-inspired meal, you can probably consider one here. Just avoid that OG Sauce. And take lots of napkins; you'll need them."}
{"text":"It's located close to where I live and have passed by it million times.  After seeing some rave reviews on Yelp and finally decide to grab a quick bite here.  It's made to order so it is fresh and hot.  Ordered a notorious wrap as I craved the pork gyro I had during Athens trip.  The flavour is quite good, sliced pork is balanced well with other added ingredient, and fries is crispy but I think pork tends to be on lean and dry side, as I usually prefer the meat to be juicy and tender.  For a snack bite, I'd think it's a good option as I find it presents a nice change of flavour in Annex area where it was dominated by Japanese or Korean restaurants.  As for the price, it's average and I find the portion to be small for a full meal.
It presents as a fast food joint so no tips necessary.  Will probably visit again but next time I'll try a dinner plate instead as I find the portion is a bit small for me."}
{"text":"Organized crime, veggie burger and gyro poutine were pretty good.  Reasonably priced.  About 25 seats available inside.  One clean bathroom behind the closed door that says employees only."}
{"text":"Have had lamb gyros and chicken gyros...was very happy with both. The pita is grilled nicely to be soft and warm. Most importantly...the meat is deelish. Lamb gyros was very flavourful, tender, juicy. Ditto for chicken. Definitely the star of the meal (as it should be)

For slight improvement...fries could stand to be a little crispier and could go easier on the tzatziki (so just ask for a little).

Also, they have an interesting menu...some pita have sweet potato fries and chipotle mayo. BUT, they still do have the good ol standby of tzatziki, feta, onion, tomatoes, and fries (the standard by which all greek places should be measured)"}
{"text":"I've tried many of the gyro restaurants around town and the OG has the Best gyro hands down .. The different combinations of toppings they've put together in their gyros definitely takes gyro to another level. If you are looking healthier alternative they also  have very tasty greek salads which you can top off with gyro as well ... The restaurant is spotless and the staff was great. Overall I had a great experience and will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"this is a very good place to eat , chicken is cooked very nicely and the pita is so soft"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why I continued coming to this place. Food is terrible, service is terrible. Orders take FOREVER. Their staff is entirely flustered. They run out of food and no one seems to have any idea that maybe, just maybe, they could make more potatoes? It's like they hire people without brain cells. Their greek salad is basically iceberg lettuce. I may not be Greek, but I sure know that a traditional Greek salad is not made with lettuce, let alone iceberg!! Sure, they may be cheaper than the competition around the corner, but this place is not worth it. I'll be shocked if this place lasts the year.

Oh, and they serve men first, before women. FYI people."}
{"text":"Every time! I just keep coming. The best way to have lunch. Worth every cent. It's so delicious that you just forget your manners and devour it insatiably. It was one of the pork gyros with tomatoes, onion, normal fries and house sauce instead of tzatziki."}
{"text":"O.G. is our go-to for take-away in the annex. The O.G. chicken gyro is delicious but their lamb meal is my favourite. 

Their potatoes are damn good too!

Service is always fast and friendly. Wish they delivered to my place!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times if I'm desperately hungry as I live close by, but its not very appetizing... I wish it was, but every time I go I end up with a gyro that contains both slimy chicken fat and crunchy chicken bits, old fries that are cold, and sauce leaking all over the place. 
Nah thank you"}
{"text":"I'm on board - this place is great in every way.  Nice staff, high quality, decent amount amount of food for the price."}
{"text":"The menu had some very interesting names and if it's your first time, be sure to read the provided descriptions. Staff were friendly and took a mere 3 minutes to complete my order. The meat was a little over grilled but that's subjective. One thing they should add is a washroom because it is really hard to eat gyros without making a mess! Prices are fair and the food is filling."}
{"text":"First experience at this place was great. It's a trendy feel on a gyro stop. Conveniently located but not easily recognizable at first glance. Different choices in seating was nice and the menu was creative. I had the Organized Crime Chicken Wrap, it was recommended to me and I would vouch for it"}
{"text":"Came here for the great reviews! I got the chicken OG gyro and added tzaziki.
The chicken was flavourful and the tzaziki was tasty from what I could tell although the house sauce was mustard based and pretty overpowering.
It's my fault really though, I just assumed the house sauce at a Greek spot would be yogurt based. Either way it didn't ruin my experience at all, I'll definitely come back and just add tzaziki!
I also had a refreshing lemonade and they had hot sauce available (always a BIG plus in my books, no tobasco crap!)
It was VERY clean, spacious and inviting."}
{"text":"Our favorite Greek place in that neighborhood. We live nearby and sampled quite a few, and this one comes out on top."}
{"text":"We were in the area and decided to drop by for a quick bite to eat, having seen the favourable reviews for The Original Gyro Grill. We both ordered the OG lamb gyro which came to about $20, which is quite expensive for a simple gyro sandwich in my opinion.

Our food came quickly and the staff were reasonably friendly, but that's where the good news ends. The lamb was fatty and tasteless, and the pita itself was cold. The caramelized mushrooms looked appetizing on the menu but did little to lift what was an overall flavourless, bland gyro.

I couldn't finish the gyro and left with a distinct feeling of an impending upset stomach. I'm not sure if there has been a change of management or chef recently, but my experience definitely didn't live up to the previous positive reviews.

Don't think I will ever visit again, there are far better gyros to be had a few subway stops east."}
{"text":"Broken oven/ stove meant I needed to buy some dinner. Picked this place because of the good reviews ... clearly this is a good place for late night snacks.  
I had the Chicken Gyro Dinner and it was terrible. The potato's were under cooked, the rice was cold & the salad was a sad wilted mess. The chicken was okay, because it was too salty. 
The staff was nice, service was prompt. 

Maybe the poutines and pitas are better so try those. I can't recommend the dinner."}
{"text":"Organised Crime! Can't go wrong with that order. It's my favourite for lunch and the portion is good enough to for you to want a salad for dinner. 

It'd a blend of yogurt sauce with chicken and sweet potato fries, all on a pita bread. They have options for burgers, wraps and dinner platters. 

Make sure you are hungry when you go here!"}
{"text":"Great fast food for on the go. Has plenty of volume and flavor. The ambiance inside is  nice, clean and chill. I went around 3-4 pm on a work day and there were people coming and going pretty frequently. Tables and bar stools all made of wood. It's a nice place to grab a quick bite."}
{"text":"Great fast food gyro joint in the Annex. Ordered the gyro poutine. It comes in a big box and is packed with meat and gravy. Good place to grab a quick delicious meal if you are in a rush."}
{"text":"FAVORITE poutine place in all of Toronto. Extremely satisfied and would come back every day if I lived in Toronto. I got the chicken poutine and it was HUGE. The chicken tasted fresh and perfectly seasoned. It was cut into thin slices that I ate with the fries which went together deliciously. The fries were cooked enough to be a little crispy-- just the way I like them and there was a good amount of gravy so that my food wasn't drowning in it. 10/10 so happy with the food and fast service."}
{"text":"Small place. Friendly staff. Had the OG Lamb gyro. Delicious option. The lamb was tender, juicy and flavorful. It was my first time and will definitely come back to try some other options."}
{"text":"This was a good place until I encounter a staff at the cash being very rude to asian customers, the lady was harsh with my pop and had an attitude, not what I remember o.g. to be like...the previous front staff/the person who takes order was super friendly and treated everyone with respect. It does not matter how great the food may be, racism and discrimination killed it for me......"}
{"text":"Good gyros, fries and fire feta. You can sit outside if the weather is nice and drink from their selection of Boylan sodas."}
{"text":"2.5

I ordered the chicken gyro poutine and I found it to be mediocre. The fries were good... but were they the best type of fries for poutine? Me thinks not! They're the type of fries best suited with plain ketchup. Not poutine quality fries. Poutine quality fries should be soft and shouldn't be clashing with the other ingredients! Which brings me to the other ingredients... The texture of the feta cheese + gravy kinda reminded me of vomit and the chicken was Swiss Chalet-esque. 

I'm just disappointed..."}
{"text":"I've lived near Greektown for years and the lamb gyros on a pita I had at OG is better than anything on a pita I've ever had in Greektown. I didn't find this place on Yelp as it is only two weeks old. I liked it so much I arduously typed in their Yelp listing on my iPhone."}
{"text":"Come here so often! As a student, this serves as a wonderful and economic meal that is incredibly delicious, filling and well priced. 

I first discovered it when I went to Bandidos Burritos next door and they said they didn't open till an hour later. So I said, heck I can't wait...and proceeded to check out this lovely gyro place.

And what a pleasant discovery it was! Their loaded gun and OG are a thing of ecstatic beauty! They never do disappoint!"}
{"text":"I had a pork gyro and the serving size would really fill you up. One issue, though, the gyro I got was kinda cold. It felt like the pork wasn't straight out the grill and actually has been cooked a couple of hours before.

The place was pretty quiet, wenth there on a Saturday around 2pm. It's worth a try if you are in the area and want a filling lunch."}
{"text":"The best gyros in town! 'Turn-up' and 'Organized Crime' (their chicken gyros with yam fries) are my absolute favorites!"}
{"text":"The positive: Very tasty gyros. The meat is top notch. The fries are a great touch in the pita. UberEats also delivers. 
The negative: The roast potatoes are just quartered potatoes lacking in any real interesting flavour.
I'd recommend it"}
{"text":"Space is tight and gets crowded easily. I came with a group of 5 and it was quite difficult to find a spot with enough seats. 
Tables are not wiped down too often but the Staff members seem decently friendly. Decor around the restaurant is cute and cozy. 
The gyro however did taste pretty good but a little difficult for me to eat."}
{"text":"I needed a quick bite in between appointments and was craving the flavour of Tsaziki. This place hits the spot!

Although this place is \"fast food\", the food isn't made super fast and it tastes a bit fresher (less oily) than other fast food gyro grills. 

They have a quite a few options, named uniquely, which is quite interesting and makes me want to come back to try something else. For my first visit, I ordered the class pork gyro with tzatziki, tomatoes, onions, topped w/fries ($8.05). Meat was cooked perfectly, lots of tzatziki, fresh fries - what more can you ask for in a gyro!

Next time I'm in the area, I'd try either their notorious pork with grilled jalapenos and caramelized onions or the loaded gun with a mix of fries and yam fries!"}
{"text":"The food here was okay, but nothing to write home about. Seating can be tight, if the weather permits we may be better off taking it to go. I had the turn up. The flavor overall was ok. The chicken was bland and a little dry, but I enjoyed the chipotle sauce a lot. The sweet potatoes right in the pita was a nice touch. Price is a little higher then a lot of the other places I have eaten, I would say that this was a little bit lower quality as well. I would go back again if someone asked me to, but otherwise I don't think I would swing by, I just wasn't too impressed. With so many great places to eat in Toronto I would say look further, but don't be too disappointed if you get dragged here either."}
{"text":"Was in the neighborhood so I decided to check this place out. I decided on the pork gyros dinner and was really impressed. It was a lot of food and tasted great. I returned  on another day and got the O.G. Loaded Poutine and was blown away. I didn't have any high hopes but it was so effin good! I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Tried two gyros on pita:
The Greek Hook-Up (pork gyro, tzatziki, tomatoes, raw onions, and fries)
The O.G (chicken gyro, house sauce, tomatoes, raw onions, and fries)

The verdict:
Chicken over Pork
Tzatziki over House Sauce

The pork was too salty, but the chicken was just right. In terms of texture, both were quite tender.

The house sauce tasted mustardy and more suitable for a burger than for a gyro pita. The tzatziki was garlic-y enough, and really flavourful.

Loved the raw onions. Tip: try adding the hot sauce - it's really good!

Price was right. Came out to about $7 each. Next time I know what to order! I'd get the O.G. with tzatziki instead of house sauce. Or maybe will try one of their more adventurous options."}
{"text":"It was good but a little heavy on the stomach with the amount of chicken and Lamb that we got in our gyro sandwiches.
But I guess Some people like it full of chicken or meat.

The poutine though was great! OG Poutine with only chicken and no tzatziki."}
{"text":"I went to their Gerrard location and got a small greek salad, and the total came out to $6 with tax. 
It was a decently sized box, but inside was mostly lettuce/greens, with a sprinkling of feta, some cucumber, 2 pieces of tomato, and one measly kalamata olive. Tasted okay but for the price, I expected a greek salad with, well, more greek stuff on it."}
{"text":"Got the lamb gyro dinner ( lamb, rice, potato, salad) lamb was ok, sat out on rotator too long so the outside was like eating leather but the inside was pretty moist and tasted simple. Overall not worth 21.50$ ( tax incl.) for the amount of lamb I was given cuz rice and potato cost nothing and the salad was literally lettuce w a single olive and a single piece or tomato so also costs nothing to them. Gave a lot of rice which was nice but it seems deliberate to cover up for the lack of meat. The portion of meat was fine but not 21.50$ acceptable, maybe 13$ acceptable. So value is weak, taste is plain but fine, potato was the best thing tbh. Hot sauce sucked. Just average place."}
{"text":"I was in the Annex on a late Friday afternoon looking for a quick bite to eat which lead me to The Original Gyro Grill. It's a small place with minimal seating and it's not a formal sit down restaurant but more of a place for a quick bite.

I ordered the special which was the Greek Hook-Up (A pork or chicken gyro with tzatziki, tomatoes and onions topped with fries), roasted potatoes or rice with a Greek salad ($8.85 plus tax) along with a can of ginger ale ($1.30 plus tax) which is a pretty reasonable deal.

The chicken gyros was decent, the chicken was a little on the dry side but seasoned well and the fries inside the gyros were okay, something I'm not accustomed to, having fries inside a gyros but it worked. The bread was soft and the tzatziki was pretty good and had a good garlic taste. The rice was nicely done and perfectly cooked and the produce used in the Greek salad was all fresh.

Service was friendly and the staff was more than willing to accommodate any change requests.

I think The Original Gyro Grill is a decent choice for a quick bite to eat in the Annex, food is good but not great and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"I'm not really good a reviewing so excuse this: this place has really great authentic gyro with some great menu combinations"}
{"text":"The food was good but we probably will not go back unless we are in the area and in dire need of food. I asked one of the workers how big the flatbread was and I don't think he understood the question so I ordered double the amount of food come to find out one gyro would've been more than enough! My husband and I had enough food for four people even though there were only two of us there. The food was good but definitely nothing to remember. The chicken was good but it was definitely on the greasy side. The lamb was a bit too pungent."}
{"text":"Food: Lamb Gyro with fries + side order of potatoes wedges.

Positives: 
Clean place
Food reminds me of stuff you can get during the Taste of the Danforth.
Lamb isn't the ground up sponge block, instead its layered lamb pieces that gets sliced right off the rotisserie and served hot. (feel like there is some better cooking terminology that i should be writing.)

Potato wedges cooked as thick slices, and marinated with lemon and i forget the pine tasting herb... Thank goodness they didn't treat it like regular french fries.

Ideal for students.  Small Place.

Is this this good Greek food, can't say (maybe someone who is Greek would be shaking their heads)... is it a step up from Mr Greek?  Absolutely.  Should you feel guilty grabbing a bite to eat here?  No.  Good job."}
{"text":"SO MUCH FOOD I ALMOST DIED.

I ordered the $12 pork gyro dinner. It was an intimidating quantity of pork that dared me to eat it all, a large, fresh Greek salad, delicious potatoes, and instead of rice I got an extra salad. It came with a cool tzatziki sauce that perfectly balanced out the house-made Greek hot sauce. 

I couldn't finish it all, so I got one of the salads, topped it with the remaining pork, and had an awesome snack while video editing later that night.

10/10. Would bang again."}
{"text":"Update: this place used to be my absolute favourite go-to for burgers until they raised the prices and changed the patty altogether. I'm not sure about regular burgers, but they veggie burger was a gross frozen party that was so disappointing, as compared to the delicious homemade bean and vegetable party they had before. 
I'll never go back"}
{"text":"Great Food!! slow service tho! 
Authentic gyros in Toronto"}
{"text":"Love the food, love the concept.....This is seriously the best Gyros place in Toronto. The staff is also very friendly."}
{"text":"Dropped by this place for a quick bite this evening, having been tipped off by some friends. I had the \"organized crime\" gyro. Service was unfriendly. As for the gyro itself, it was pretty bad. The sauce had this very intense, flat taste, reminiscent of fast food (I'm thinking of Subway in particular). To top off my experience here, shortly after eating (like 15 min) I felt distinctly ill (stomach pains and whatnot). It thankfully subsided after half an hour or so, but I definitely don't plan on going to this place again. 

If you're in the area looking for a quick bite, you'd definitely be better off trying one of the nearby shawarma joints- I've been to both Pita Q, and Sarah's Shawarma and both are solid options. There's also Fresh, this vegetarian place on Bloor and Spadina. It's is a bit pricier, but it's more than worth it! :D"}
{"text":"On a team lunch outing, we decided to come here.
Though this isn't a traditional sit-down place, we were able to gather some tables and chair to eat-in.
As for the menu, they've got a great selection, however in keeping with the Friday special I decided to order their Beef Teteke (Greek Burger) with fries $8.  When I decided to add a drink my bill came to $13, which I found a bit pricey.   In addition though it was a Friday special it was quite a wait for a fast food type of place.
However, as for food, their portions are  huge especially when factoring in the fries, which I couldn't finish.  The teteke, was wrapped in a pita was quite tasty, with more fries drizzled with Tzatziki sauce. 
Food coma never hit me hard like this in a while. 

overall experience was okay."}
{"text":"As a first time customer and a first time eating a gyro i give this place 5 stars!

A friend of mine reccomended we have a dinner night here.
O..m..g!
Delicious food!
I got the \"Turn up\" gyro, substituted the yam fries for regular fries and me and my husband shared the chicken gyro poutine.

The food was absolutely incredible! 
My gyro was a bit too spicy for my tastes but I just rubbed off some of the sauce so it wasn't burning my tongue, but other than that it was delicious!
The feta on the poutine was incredible, i honestly can't say anything bad about the food it was that good.

The service was also top notch, the main girl seemed very concerned and wanted to keep making sure we were having a good visit, which we did! 

This restaurant is conveniently placed across the street from the subway, easy to get to, plenty of seating, and they are also part of the \"just eat\" service you can order from online.

Top notch for a greek food amateur!

5/5"}
{"text":"The Original Gyro Grill is a fast-food style, Greek restaurant.  A wrap costs around $7 and meals are around $14.  Meals and wraps are large and made to order.  The menu offers little in terms of vegetarian options and basically french fries if you're vegan.  The bathroom is on the same floor as the eating area, but is not accessible.  

I don't understand this place.  My partner and I ordered the chicken souvlaki dinner.  It came with rice, potatoes, chicken, pita, salad and 2 chicken skewers.  The meal was massive, and enough for 2 people and made to order.  

Everything was delicious, and like, really really delicious.  EXCEPT they put this \"house sauce\" on everything and it's not very good.  They soaked the potatoes and rice in it and the sauce made everything greasy and salty.  The chicken was tender and delicious, the salad was good, the pita and tzaziki were great but the rice and potatoes were drenched in sauce.  To make matters worse, someone who was working asked how I liked it.  I wanted to say \"hey, you should have asked me about this sauce before covering EVERYTHING on the plate in it\" but I was full and tired."}
{"text":"French Fries were cold and stale. And the pork was not fresh. I will not come back."}
{"text":"The absolute best!! Had the sweet revenge and it did not disappoint! The staff was really friendly and nice as well. Wait time was not long at all! I would go here everyday if I lived close!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The lamb gyro is so tasty. Good place to beat a hangover. Also the gyro dinners are the best in town trust me I've have tried a few places and they don't come close to this place"}
{"text":"The O.G is my old faithful of late night cravings! It's a pita sandwich bursting with your choice of meat, tomatoes, onions, their yummy house sauce and even better tzaziki. The dinner combos are also delicious and generous enough for two meals!"}
{"text":"I usually order the food delivery and i'm always satisfied. 

Portions are large and flavourful. I would highly recommend the turn up and Chicken Gyros Poutine."}
{"text":"Ugh, can't wait to go back.  I got a taste of this place when I came to Tilt a few weeks ago.  I only got a taste of my friends gyro as I was too full, but damn it was good.  All my other friends that got something that night couldn't stop raving about it.  So I vowed to come back.

Finally, another friend having their bday downtown led to my opportunity! Yesssss.  My friend and I decided to split a pork gyro as I knew they were pretty big.  I didn't want anything too heavy before the club.  My bf got the lamb gyro and my friend's bf got a chicken souvlaki on a pita. We all loved it.  The boys devoured their full pitas before my gf and I could even finish our halves!  I love how generous they are with the fries in the gyro.  They also have yam fries as an option!  My bf loved the lamb.  I tried a piece and it was nice a juicy.  I can only take so much lamb though because it has such a distinct taste.  I can't wait to come back and try the mix gyro with yam fries.  SO much more on the menu I wanna try.  Should I dare say it?  They're ALMOST just as good as Alexandro's!  Gasp!  

Oh ya and when were ordering the girl heard us say we were splitting a gyro and she offered to cut it for us!  How nice!"}
{"text":"I been here twice now so I am more than qualified to review their food. Tired the lamb gyro wrap and it was so tasty and tender. I highly recommend the lamb to everyone! The staff are really friendly. It is so fast compared to Messini's, but that might not be a fair comparison. I will be back here for sure!"}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant with friendly service and great food. Been here a few times and this place really is as good as it gets- that said I've only been eating wraps here so far.

For a decent price, they probably offer the best wraps in the city. You can't go wrong with the OG, Hook-Up, and Sweet Revenge wraps, probably the best wrap I've ever eaten is the Loaded Gun wrap which is amazing with a mix of chicken and pork gyro meat and a mix of yam and potato fries. So far everything I've eaten here is solid, but the Beefteki and squid wraps while good aren't really representative of how great this place's wraps can be. The daily deal also is really worth checking out, which usually consists of a wrap+fries.

Prep time ranges from very fast (most wraps, etc) to 10 minutes+ (Beefteki). Almost always I'm amazed how quickly I get my eats. Also worth a note- the menu inside the store seems quite a bit cheaper than the online menu (just finished the Loaded Gun for 10$~ with tax, whereas online it claims to be 12.40$).

Definitely going to be a repeat customer (live nearby and been going there frequently since I tried it for the first time). Made this account to review this place in fact."}
{"text":"Oh Gawwddd.. The OG is soo delicious.

Ordered the OG lunch combo to-go so I could enjoy this baby at a park nearby.
The pita was scrumptious, filled with tender chicken pieces, fries, a creamy sweet house sauce and veggies. The salad and rice were on par as well. 

10$. Worth."}
{"text":"Was here for lunch yesterday and it is yummy!!!  Tried the popular Greek Hook-Up Gyro on a pita.  This is a traditional style pork gyro with tzatziki, fries, and tomato (I think that's everything).  It was fantastic!!! Many times I find pork gyro meat has chewy fatty parts... Not this one.  The spicing was also perfect and it was moist not dry like some places.  This is now my favourite gyro spot.  I've already picked out the gyro's I want to try next.
The location is smaller with limited seating.  Most people seemed to be getting take out.  I also noticed they also yam fries and gluten free pita for those looking for healthier options."}
{"text":"A new and clean environment but found the food to be covered in oil, wasn't a fan of the pork gyros as it was really fatty yet dry."}
{"text":"Tried two gyros on back-to-back days. My suggestion: go with Turn Up because OG is wayyy too salty.

Good portion for the price.Chicken could be a litter moister though. There were too many crunchy dried pieces for my liking"}
{"text":"This food was just ok. Kind of torn between 2.5 and 3 stars. I'm honestly surprised how many glowing reviews this place has. I wanna have more faith in my fellow Yelpers!

I ordered the pork gyro meal. The portions are enormous, there's no way I could finish it in one meal, so that's a plus. The rice was fine, potatoes ok, massive pile of meat was greasy but not awful. The salad was not a Greek salad, barely had any feta, was made w a weird mix of Iceburg chunks and garden mix, and the dressing was pretty disappointing. 

Pita was good and tzatziki was passable. Might have been better if I'd ordered a souvlaki wrap or something. There's too much good Greek in Toronto for me to rate this place any higher but it's fine if you want a quick, affordable meal."}
{"text":"Tastiest meat ever! Had the pork dinner plate. Potatoes and salad were also very tasty. Salad dressing wasn't traditional Greek, but still very good so no complaints whatsoever."}
{"text":"I didn't know gyros could taste this good. Even the bread the sandwich came in was fresh, unique and wonderful. 

Can't wait to try everything else on the menu!

Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"I was told of this place by my mom. She recommended not to go to the other Greek place around the corner on Bloor Street. My bf and I opted for this place because we try to find places that accomodate both of our eating habits.... 

THIS PLACE IS AMAZING. I really enjoyed my veggie gyro. And my bf's meal was so HUGE. I am happy that it satisfied him. 

The staff were also helpful and kind. 

Although they should change the radio station from time to time.

All in all I would strongly recommend this place to anyone seeking Greek Food."}
{"text":"I surprisingly find myself here fairly often. I used to live in the neighbourhood so I used to drop by here a lot. Every single time that i've been here, i've had a good experience! The price is more than reasonable, staff is nice, the dining area is clean and it's always fairly empty. The food is so good, and the wraps are always packed with meat or veggies. This has been my go-to for about a year now, highly recommend it. :)"}
{"text":"I had the OG gyro, and it was as good as I could ask for for $7!  It was pretty close to the real thing!

Fresh and flavourful meat, topped off with crunchy fries, house dressing, and yummy tomatoes and onions!  

They have quite a few options and you can have a lunch combo (salad+rice/potatoes [drink sold separately]) for about $12-$15.

If you don't want the high carb, big fat, lotsa meat lunch, opt for one of their salads for about $11-$13.

I'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Great Greek food.  I totally recommend this place to any greek food lover."}
{"text":"Got the pork gyro dinner for $12. 

They give you a ton of food with lots of meat, rice, salad, pita, etc. The pork was a bit dry but tasted alright. Everything else was also more or less average. 

I would have given it 3 stars but I bumped it up to 4 because they give you quite a bit of food for $12. That said, I'm new to the area so I'm not sure how it compares to other locations here."}
{"text":"The last few visits, were absolutely horrible. I remember when I came here for the first few times. They were generous with their portions and served good quality meat. Now, they are so stingy with their portions, while trying to stuff the gyros with a lot of fries instead of meat. Plus, the meat must be old, because it was so hard and tough to chew. I'm never going back again. So pissed off."}
{"text":"Always hits the spot. 

Personal favourites are the loaded gun and the Turn up. Also you must try the OG Fries. Phenomenal!"}
{"text":"4.5* 

Having opened within steps of another gyro joint, I was quite curious to see who would come on top as the new gyro champ on the block. To my surprise, OG has done much more than that and climbed all the way to #1 on my Greek fix list (coming soon to Yelp!)

The lamb OG is so far my favourite item, and it's hard to order anything else once you've tried it here. The wrap was absolutely stuffed with delicious meat, and came to ~$10 tax/tip included. The chicken chipotle gyro is also good, but it would not be my top choice if I'm looking for that Greek taste! 

The staff have always been kind during my visits, the turnaround is quick, and the place looks very clean. Overall a fine addition to the 'hood."}
{"text":"Just ordered off Uber eats & it was delicious! I ordered the calamari dinner and everything was perfect! Great price & great food!"}
{"text":"Was not as impressed as I was hoping for. Meat had decent flavour but did not seem to be of the best quality, though they do pack the gyros quite nicely for their size (which isn't that big) - shared the lamb OG and regular beef gyros with the wife and we both felt the same about both of them. Note that we only ate once we got home after about 20 minutes so your experience may be better, but I am basing my rating on the meat quality/flavour and not on the soggy pita/lettuce, which clearly could have been easily avoided. OG fries were quite good even after steaming in the cardboard carton for as many minutes. Would try again if I happen to be in the Annex and in the mood for greek, but wouldn't go out of my way for it."}
{"text":"Food was crap not to mention the lady gave my order to someone else so I was stuck waiting for my meal."}
{"text":"Phenomenal tzatziki sauce. Best I've tried so far. I always switch my potatoes to yam to make it a bit healthier, their rice and pita bread is amazing as well. I wish they can add some desserts on their menu though."}
{"text":"Great place, close to the subway. I had the gyros poutine. Generous portion size with a affordable price. I would recommend it. Only thing I like changed is to use cheese curds instead of feta."}
{"text":"This is an okay place nothing wrong with it it's just that if you want a warm, good gyro then I'd recommend elsewhere because the meat was cold. Other than that the food came out really quickly and the fries were good."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised at how good this was.

WAIT: Came right when it opened at 11:00 am on a Monday and were the first ones.  By the time we left at 11:30 we were still the only ones.  The food does take some time to make (could be because we were the first ones) so we probably waited almost 10 minutes before our food came out.

ATMOSPHERE: small inside (but they do have a bathroom!) with a few high top tables and then a low bench style table.  You can see the slabs of meat rotating behind in the kitchen.

FOOD: Got the OG chicken gyro. They have lots of options and different types of fries but we decided to go with something more simple. 

OG CHICKEN GYRO w/ TZATZIKI - the only difference between this and the OG is the tzatziki sauce.  The pita comes folded but is pretty large, enough for 1 person of 2 people if you aren't that hungry. It has these slices of chicken that are slightly crispy and tasty, very very good and not dry at all.  It then has the cool and tangy tzatziki sauce, onion, tomato and...FRENCH FRIES! It's like a California burrito, but gyro.  I was skeptical about how good a gyro sandwich an taste but was proven wrong.  Not only that, but the pita bread was very soft and tasty.

Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our gyro sandwich.  I would want to try lamb if I ever come back to Toronto."}
{"text":"i had greek food in mind this morning, as we spent it walking and burning through high park, my first choice was all the grk...after remembering seeing a photo of the gyro poutines that are offered...this became choice #1

we got here moments after business was opened, this is a fair sized resturant for location and how it looks on the outside. we placed an order for a gyro each and a gyro poutine to split between the both of us. 
having been a very big fan of gyros and greek food in general. this place knocks it out of the park. 
the flavors and matching of the food in both the gyro and the poutine were bar none. if your a fan of either YOU need to eat here, without a doubt. 
the waitress and staff were super happy and eager to answer any and all questions. as well as bring extra utensils and napkins, which we ended up needing
the bad: personally two things could have made the food pop a bit more, more sauce/gravy in the gyro/poutine and more cheese, but this is a \"me\" thing."}
