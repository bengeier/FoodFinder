{"text":"Authentic diner.  Food was excellent and coffee was just what I was expecting.  Try the scrapple if you eat here."}
{"text":"I have visited for several years, but not in a predictable manner:  they actually remember me!  I find this such a friendly place with unpretentious, homey style of cookery.  The portion sizes are like what you make at home for a reasonable price.  What I've always liked are the homemade cakes, frosted daily.   Check it out!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for some delicious breakfast in a quaint little diner, look no further.  This is one of my favorite weekend spots.  The serivce is quick, the food good.  Know before you go: cash only and small tables!"}
{"text":"I love these types of places - little holes in the wall with good food and friendly service. Everything I tasted was good with plenty of coffee to go around. I'm not sure how clean it is, but they must have passed inspection right? Good prices for a good breakfast."}
{"text":"Consistently good food in a friendly environment.  Great for breakfast - awesome home fries.  Also Love the burger and French fries.  Friendly, attentive service...the way it's supposed to be."}
{"text":"Simple, classic diner food. Delicious with a colorful clientele. Very busy Saturday and Sunday, open until 2pm, and CASH ONLY. Perfect turkey clubs, fresh burgers, and outstanding breakfast. I go once a day (though i often forget to check in!) Be nice to the waitstaff, they're the best around!"}
{"text":"Food is not very good.  Its very small portions, the home fries are greasy and under cooked (I like mine crispy) eggs were dry and flavorless.
My husband likes the small town feel in the classic atmosphere.  Had a slice of French toast that was good, will get that next we go."}
{"text":"As the 3 stars says, Frazer Diner is A-OK. It's what you picture in your head when you think of a Diner: amazing coffee, satisfying breakfast food in a big, metal hot dog-shaped building that looks like every item inside (including patrons) are from pre-1960. Portions were smaller than I'm used to for a diner, but the staff is friendly. Pro Tip: don't try this place with a party of more than 4 - it's a small place, and you will only irritate everyone. 

It benefits from the Classic Diner being just down the street, which is a much nicer place (although NOT a prototypical diner), and is always packed. We tried for the Classic, and ended up (with about 10 other people who couldn't find a parking space either at the Classic) at the Frazer Diner, which is not necessarily a bad thing."}
{"text":"Older blonde hair woman with long hair in a pony tail, heavy set came out hollering at me to move my car all I was doing was dropping a check off at the dentist next door, just a few yards away, even if that  maybe 1 minute tops, just a quick run in. Then was going to go over there to eat, (never been at this restaurant by the way) she came at me like that left a bad taste in my mouth and I haven't even tried the food... Lol all good. Never will eat there.
I don't like people who are rude like that, regardless, can only imagine what they would put in the food."}
{"text":"I have been going to the Frazer Diner for twenty years.  I have been going there with my wife, my friends, my ex-wife, my children, my girlfiriends, my new wife, my soon to be new ex-wife,  and now my grandchildren. I read every review, there is a lot of truth: (Prof. J. \"They use white American cheese\" ....what did you expect, gruyere or cave aged cheddar.  Dee M \"can't sit at a table if you are alone\" --they are running a business, who can afford to have you nursing a coffee at a table for 4 during the breakfast rush.  \"No leg room at the counter\"  The place was built in the 30's--I guess they should have planned for obesity in the US reaching 36% in 2016.  (Discriminatory??) shame on you for using that word.. One star, two stars--no way.                                                                                      

I don't eat eggs benedict, crepes,  baby spinach, artisian pancetta, or avocado for breakfast, I want hot coffee, eggs (scrambled in butter), home fries, bacon or sausage, made right and scorching hot--the Frazer Diner always delivers.  I eat white bread toast (yeah I said it--white bread) with Smucker's jelly in little packets and more butter and I want it prepared by old white guys, that looked like they slept in the kitchen.  I like a two page menu that they nail every time. No Belgian waffles? This isn't the 64 Worlds Fair.  Do you want variety? Go to the Classic Diner (Great Menu, Large Portions ,Pay Double)

                                                                                                                                                They have their faults, I avoid their OJ (Rosenbergs) and chocolate milk (Hersheys syrup), I don't care.  The people are nice, the service is prompt--even when the place is jammed. Move on if you must, it is what it is, and if I am the last person sitting at the counter of the Frazer Diner it won't bother me one bit. I will be reading the Daily Local in peace and the kids will know where to find me.

4-8-2017 Went to the Diner with the family. I ordered 2 egg/bacon/cheese on white toast.  and a coke. $14.00.  no way..this ain't the Classic Diner..trouble might be brewin...have to start checking the prices...I don't go there to pay $14.00 plus tax..plus tip...

A fond kiss, and then we sever,
A fond farwell?, Alas forever,....."}
{"text":"This place has become the wife and I's weekend breakfast standard. They aren't too busy on the Friday AM, the food is your typical diner fare, and the diner car itself has to be one of the most authentic I've ever seen. We've also been able to do breakfast for both of us on the super-cheap, so we love that these days."}
{"text":"I travel to this area for business and always have at least one breakfast here. I love the original diner experience/atmosphere. The place is old but very clean and orderly. Staff and patrons are always friendly and chatty. You're not a stranger here unless you want to be. 

Today I paid $12.30 (without tip) for endless cup of coffee, one over easy egg, pork roll and one pancake. Seemed a bit on the high side but this isn't McDonalds. I'm sure I was charged ALA carte pricing. I guess I should have ordered a standard menu breakfast with these items but then I wouldn't have finished and food would have been thrown away. 

Egg was cooked to perfection, pancake is huge (I only ate half), pork roll (2 slices) on the thin side. I prefer my pork roll sliced thicker and if it were I would be happy with one thick slice instead of two really thin ones. 

I like this place and really hope they stick around.  I took a hard look at the outside and it appears it's been sorely neglected. Sign of the future?  Hope not cause I really want to return!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a breakfast sandwich recently, (Eggs, bacon and cheese) very dissappointed.

When I used to eat here years ago, I always got the omelet and homefries and it was pretty good. I dont know what has happend over time but things have changed. The portions are small and the food just isnt that good anymore. 

The last time I ate here was 2 years ago, I had the french toast for breaksfast and it was really lacking. Just like the previous poster stated more toast than anything, really not to flavorful.

On my most recent visit I paid $4.51 for my breakfast sandwich, which was totally not worth it. The bacon was over salty and not cripsy, it also appeared that they only give you 1 egg on the sandwich. You can also tell they use cheap American cheese, which everyone knows does not melt that well.

Waste of my money, I was very dissapointed. Will never go here to eat again."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times over the years, yesterday I found myself slightly disappointed. I ordered the Frazer Finest (2 eggs, 2 French Toast, Scrapple) it all came on the same plate.  I asked for a plate to separate my French Toast (syrup) from my eggs (over easy) so not everything would run together. I was told I would be charged add money for a unused extra clean plate.  It then occured to me for the same amount of money I can go to Shady Maple have all I can eat and a stack of clean plates at no extra cost.  Sorry Frazer Diner you did me wrong!"}
{"text":"CASH ONLY, just a heads up.

With lots of diners to choose from around this area, I would have expected better service my first time here. I arrived excited, noting to my boyfriend that I think I had read good reviews for this diner. When we walked in I was surprised by the size, but I have been too much smaller diners. Walking by the register, I received no eye contact from the three waitresses crammed behind the counter. Not even so much as a \"hello\". I understand they may not want to be working on a Saturday morning, but at least the hello would be nice. One waitress seems to be annoyed by our presence, eyeing us up as we try to find our seats. We are obviously first timers to this establishment, but there is no help or sign that says to seat yourself or otherwise...very uncomfortable. We almost left. 

After sitting at the counter, I was unsure if we were going to be helped. the gentleman next to us was helped right away but yet again there was no eye contact given from waitress, even a simple \"I'll be right with you\" would've sufficed. We ended up getting a very nice waitress. The one working tables seemed to be having a bad day with all the whispering and eye dodging she was doing in front of us?...

The food was typical diner food, small portions as other ratings have mentioned. Unfortunately, my boyfriend did find a hair in his omelette. He did not mention this until we left as he steps lightly in those situations. Prices are far better at diners down the road."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast one day, with a couple friends. We sat at the counter and enjoyed the home-y feel of the place. The food was good as well."}
{"text":"Oh Frazer Diner.  I miss you. I moved to Chicago in July and more than anything else in PA I miss the food. Especially the authentic diner food at Frazer Diner. I have eaten here at least 25 times and I was never disappointed. The service was always excellent, the staff always super friendly and the food is awesome and very affordable. I wish I could pick it up and move the entire diner to Chicago."}
{"text":"Good Diner food and coffee but not worth the rudeness of the wait staff. Dark haired waitress was extremely rude rushing us out the door. Never again."}
{"text":"Decent chow, average prices, I did not get indigestion. But shortly after the meal I DID get a fever blister on the inside of my lip.

I've been around long enough to know that is from someone handling my toast, silverware, or glass with UNWASHED HANDS.

The waitress kept stroking the area between her nose and upper lip ... EEEWWWWW! Great way to spread staph infection, lady.

So in short, I will not be back."}
{"text":"This is a great little greasy spoon. Not a ton of space, but you can usually get a table or a spot at the bar. Food came out quick and was spot on. Good cup of coffee, too."}
{"text":"Simply awesome. Consistently great food--either breakfast or lunch.  The waitresses all are friendly and helpful.  I've visited the Frazer Diner about 100 times, and have never been disappointed.  All American diner food - nothing more, nothing less.

Now for those of you who enjoy waiting an hour plus for a seat on a Saturday or Sunday morning, and paying 2x the price you'd find at the Frazer Diner, please, please, please go join jeannine S at the Classic Diner."}
{"text":"Where to begin hmmm well if you are concerned about hygiene this is not the place to dine especially with the waitresses touching their noses and face. Watched an older waitress touch her face then take cakes out of pans and ice them all along touching her face and eating cake crumbs.

Ordered Denver omelette with cheese literally had to look for it on the plate. Was charged extra for rye toast even though omelette came with toast and home fries. 

Home fries were a total joke a table spoon of cold colorless potatoes that were sent back to be cooked only to get back half a table spoon of home fries !

Total bill $11.82 and left hungrier than when I arrived am going to Wawa to get a real breakfast for $2.00!

Extremely disappointing and won't be back again!!!!"}
{"text":"Me and my daughter along with her 20 month old and 4 yr old children had a delicious breakfast. However, we were charged and additional fee for asking for two extra plates for the toddlers to share our breakfast.  I was very annoyed as I was not informed of the extra charge!  It's not the  fact  that they put it on the bill it's the fact that it was two toddlers who would not have eaten a full breakfast.  When I complained I was told by our waitress that she doesn't make the rules.  I replied well u could have at least told me!!  This is a bs policy!  I can understand if adults came in and order one entree and split, but toddlers, seriously I guess that means you don't like them nor want them in your diner!!"}
{"text":"It's ugly, it seems dirty,  it's freezing  , it's unfriendly -- as if can't wait for you just pay and get out. The food is poor to middling.. and it's not a bargain ... so it's not as if you are saving   by having to pay cash.  I had to eat in my coat."}
{"text":"Small diner in a trailer. The waitstaff was nice though, and very attentive. Basically a no frills diner, all the staples one would expect on a menu. On to the tastings. My Girlfriend was very satisfied with her egg sandwich. I however mistakenly ordered the french toast, which was all toast and no french. It was soggy, had no flavor, and just blah. Won't be coming back because there is really no point."}
{"text":"Cant sit at a table if you are alone?
Even a two top?
Must sit at counter designed in the 30's with ZERO legroom. 
Discriminatory considering its a weekday 10am. Breakfast crowd is gone. Lunch not started and 80 % of the tables are open. 

And to think i drove past COMFORTABLE  Wegmans to come here. Never again.    Shameful!"}
{"text":"We Stopped in for breakfast at this little diner. It is very old school. I don't think anything has been updated since the 50's. The menu was very basic and small, which isn't a bad thing. My simple order of eggs over easy and bacon came with a smattering of home fries. The eggs were over cooked and the bacon had something of a dirty or burnt aroma though it was crispy.  The one really odd thing and the reason I bumped them down to two stars was that both of our meals came with bread, so we were server with a 4 stack of toast on a single plate. It was very odd.

Even though I gave this place only two stars, I wouldn't not return if I couldn't find someplace else to go instead."}
{"text":"Very good experience! 5 stars for a diner! It has a very nostalgic atmosphere as it is an old train car diner. Small as it may be with only 24 seats and 17 bar seats, the service is extremely fast so I would imagine if there was a line it would move quickly. We arrived at 11:00am on a Sunday morning and there was no line. We were told we could sit anywhere, so we found a corner booth. As we sat down, and instant feeling of comfort,  quaintness and assurance as we looked the entire staff of three woman extremely busy, but not busy enough for a smile or a joke as they attended to the patrons. Our waitress was named Shelloy, who posed the correct amount of charm, attention and speed. Food came out in less than three minutes (eggs, home fries, bacon - and - vegee omelette) pre-buttered toast! Thank you! Prices were a little in the higher side for a diner, but well worth it for the atmosphere, food quality and service speed! Will come again if ever in the area!"}
{"text":"The food is ok.  The service is ok.  But they rush you out the door even when there is no one there.  \"We need the table.\"  They really need to learn better.  I was ready to give them a nice tip, but no way.  I'm not going back either."}
{"text":"Great diner food and the price is perfect.  The place has a very old fashion diner feel. Been going there since I was a kid and nothing has changed except the staff. The only downfall is that this place closes at 2pm."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this restaurant for 25 years. The nostalgic layout is appealing. Waitresses are friendly and familiar. Unfortunately due to its size gets too busy on Saturday and Sunday mornings. You have to pick a good time or prepare to stand. Raised prices a few years ago. Taking it from a really good bargain to a moderate one. 

My first bad experience was today otherwise I would rate it higher. 8:30 AM on a Monday in December and the restaurant was almost empty because I was by myself I was not allowed to sit at one of the eight open tables. I was not interested in sitting at the counter and there were plenty of seats and no one at the door. That's just bad business. I left embarrassed because I happen to be alone this time."}
{"text":"The Frazer Diner is an old time basic breakfast/lunch place frequented by a lot of locals.  The eggs are done just right and the home fries are the best in the Malvern area.  Wait staff is pleasant and refills your coffee without even being asked.  The building itself should be on the historic register as it exemplifies the 50's era old time diners that sprung up after the war.  Very fast service and you can read you paper and be out in 20 minutes.  Different story on Saturday and Sunday morning, however."}
{"text":"Took a little long for a diner on my lunch break, food was ok, good portions. Not a finer diner but a diner in true retro fashion down to the crummy wood panelling and all the fingerprinted chrome trim."}
{"text":"For the money and the \"old diner\" feel, you can't beat this place. The waitstaff is great, the eggs are fresh, the booths are old, but who cares? They are roomy and you can actually have a conversation.  My only, only complaint is the only cheese Frazer Diner has for omelets is American cheese. Not a huge deal, but whenever I go there I have a hankering for a Swiss cheese omelet and feel like Groundhog's Day (the movie) since each time the server has to remind me they only have American cheese. Oh, and I think they may not have rye toast either. 
No big deal, but good to know before you get your hopes or your hankerings (!) up!"}
{"text":"Wasn't thrilled. Omelette - only choice of cheese was white American. Bacon over cooked. They messed up the omelets and refill was non-existent. Toast - dry. No butter. I asked, it arrived 2 minutes before the check. Getting the attention of the staff for check: miracle.  Cash only... Restroom: health dept please visit"}
{"text":"I go here about 3 to 4 times a month it is a great American neighborhood diner. It is not a froufrou diner. If you want that you could always go to classic diner."}
{"text":"Hubs and I both had the cream chipped beef on toast.  Waitstaff is pleasant, service is speedy, food is good and the music was even good.  Cash only, but food and tip came to less than $20.  Tons of seats at the counter, tables seat up to 4 (tightly), but it's a diner, not a banquet hall.  We enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"A place that time has forgotten.  Great food and quick turn around."}
{"text":"Frazer Diner is one of my favorite local places for a yummy Diner breakfast.  The prices are reasonable and no matter what I get as my main course I ALWAYS get their sausage on the side.  It is simply delicious."}
{"text":"Nostalgic little hole in the wall right on Lacaster Ave.  I wandered in here with some time to kill before a doctors appointment on Wednesday AM so i figured i'd swing in.  Curb appeal = awesome.  It's ugly in the most fabulous possible way.  I parked and made my way to the counter.  The two waitresses were chatting, but quickly came over to offer me a beverage and give me a menu.  I got 2 poached eggs, rye toast, and home fries.  It came out pretty quick, and was pretty delicious.  The eggs were served right on the toast which I'm not used to, but I didn't mind it.  It's what I tend to do with poached eggs anyway.  My whole meal and tip with an iced team came in under $10.  Service was great, food was great, I'll be back."}
{"text":"In updating this review, I can honestly say that this place hasn't changed a bit. 

In some ways that's good. Prices here are very reasonable for food that is generally decent comfort food. No frills here. Just diner grub. 

My last visit here though, I got the waitress who couldn't remember anything. She had to keep running back to get me things like silverware. I had to remind her of more than one part of my order. Well, what can you do? I do take pity because it was real busy and she was one of two servers. 

One complaint... I love hot soup as much as anybody, but the soup here was served so hot, I briefly thought of calling a personal injury lawyer I know. Luckily, cooler heads (and eventually soup) prevailed."}
{"text":"I recently ate in the Frazer Diner for the first time in yearts. I found the food to be mediocre at best. I also found the place to be dirty. The owner was miserable and rude and showed no appreciation for my business. There are far better places to eat than the Frazer Diber. Do yourself a favor and don't stop here!"}
{"text":"as classic 'greasy spoons' go, this place is Legit!"}
{"text":"This place gets five stars because it was truly the best simple breakfast I have ever gotten eating out...the poached eggs were perfectly cooked, the bacon was really high quality and the hash browned potatoes were delicious.  I even got the grapefruit juice which is a bit of a gamble, but was also very good.  I'll be going back to this diner for breakfast and I'm interested in trying their lunch too.  I agree it is a bit pricey for a diner, but the food and service are worth it!"}
{"text":"This is an authentic 1940's/ 1950's diner car restaurant. It's been in it's current roadside location forever - my parents ate here when they were dating 50 years ago. 

It is not spacious nor is it fancy. It is cash only and the largest table sits a cozy 4. Formica tables, padded steel chairs, and stools at the counter.  

The service was quick and the food very good for lunch last week. Hands down they have a divine turkey club and hubby declard the open face turkey \"really good\". French fries were yummy too. Crispy on the outside moist on inside. Yum. 

So why not 5 stars?  Well it was darn close. A pet peeve:  grilled cheese sandwiches with cheese not melted all the way through. Yep. One in our group got this. *sigh*.  Drives me nuts. 

Really looking for a true diner experience?  This is your place."}
