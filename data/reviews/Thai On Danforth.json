{"text":"Never have I had such a frustrating experience with a restaurant, or food in general.

Ordered $40 worth of delivery tonight, which consisted of:

1. Green Curry Beef
2. Lemon Grass Soup
3. Curry Shrimp
4. Glass noodles.

The delivery time was double that advertised. All in all, we waited for an hour and a half. When the food finally came, we were all so appalled!

The curry shrimp, which was $13, consisted of a measly 5-6 shrimps. And they were just the regular supermarket frozen type you can get at Nofrills, not the \"tiger shrimp\" as advertised.

The glass noodles were clumpy and oily. The chicken was dry and tasteless. 

The lemon grass soup ($6.99) had a few slices of mushrooms and 4-5 shrimps. It was also unacceptably spicy. We dumped the whole thing down the drain. 

The curry beef was simply disgusting. For $12, we got skimpy slices of low grade beef which were overcooked. 

3/4 of the food ordered simply went down the drain/garbage chute. How this restaurant manages to survive with their abominable food and service is simply beyond me. But there are much better Thai restaurants in Toronto that are worthy of your patronage. This one simply does not make the grade by any measure. 

Disgusting."}
{"text":"The food was ok, nothing special. Everything was smothered in onions which some people might like but I was not a fan of having onions in everything.

Also.. the delivery took them 75 minutes on a weekday. We called and asked them if the food is still coming. Then without even asking for my name or order number, they told me they were really busy and the food should be there soon. It finally came but we were disappointed with how they handled the situation.

On the plus side though, the food was really hot, well packaged and portions were big too."}
{"text":"I honestly couldn't tell you what makes one Thai place better than another or what's more authentic and which is some North American hack (though I suppose if a poutine is a viable option under the subhead \"Canadian Menu\", then that might be one of the latter -- can't remember if this place had that but I digress).

Anyway, I went here for the first time for a date (the guy chose the place and I usually don't want my picky flag to fly just yet). I've walked by this place many times and though I'm put off by its bamboo-clad interior, the service was very friendly and attentive and I was introduced to my new love: the mango salad.

It was a torrid affair that already has me anticipating our next meeting -- perhaps it would be one unsuspecting afternoon where I pop by for some lunch or maybe it'll be a booty-call where I pick it up and head back to my place... you don't know.

Is it horrible that I remember the salad more than the date?

I also had the green curry and really enjoyed it. I'm happy to say this place might have made a spot on my regular neighbourhood haunts... now if only they could get air conditioning, then we might get married."}
{"text":"If I could give Thai One On (Danforth Location) 0 stars I would. 

I ordered food from this location last night and received it THREE hours later. I placed my order at 7:18pm and received it at 10:15pm. 

After waiting just over an hour for the food I called the customer service number on the Thai One on Website to ask if they could update me on where the driver was. I was told by the woman I spoke to that he had left 15 mins before and would arrive shortly. I proceeded to wait another 15mins and called back when no one arrived. The woman then proceeded to tell m that she in fact could not even see my order on her computer and I had contacted the wrong location. She gave me another phone number for another location and asked me to call them. I called the other location (located on Dundas) and a very helpful man Alex proceeded to call the Danforth location for me and get the driver/owner's cell phone number of the Danforth Location and suggested I call him. 

After calling the driver/owner and not reaching him I called the Danforth location where a woman put me on hold for 10 mins and came back and though she admitted my order at this point was 1 hour and 45 mins late she offered nothing but the owner/drivers cell phone number again. 

I FINALLY reached the owner/driver where he proceeded to scream at me over the phone insisting he was only 15 mins away still. So I waited yet another 20 mins called him back and he again insisted he was 15 mins away. I asked him to just let me know if he was never going to come with the food so I could at least cook something for myself and my friend however he continued to yell saying he was close by. 

Being incredibly 'hangry' at this point and utterly shocked by the extremely unprofessionalism and lack of responsibility by anyone at this location or company, I called 'customer service' again where I FINALLY reached someone who dealt with the situation gave me a credit and my food finally arrived at 10:15pm. 

I have always ordered food from Thai One On at Avenue Road and NEVER been disappointed, however I have never experienced anything this ridiculous when ordering food and felt it was important that people know the kind of service they will get if they plan to order from this location."}
{"text":"Ordered from here the other night and it was nothing but a horrible experience.

First off, it took 2 hours to get our food delivered.  Not sure if the language barrier was the problem on the phone which resulted in the driver being lost but 2 hours is just unacceptable. Especially seeing as this place is rarely busy and is only two blocks from my house.

We ordered the Pad Thai, Oodles of Noodles and Mango Chicken.

Pad Thai:  They use really wide noodles.  As a result, the noodles were very, very dry.  This is easily the worst Pad Thai I've EVER tried.  Didn't help that I had asked for extra sauce and didn't receive any....which definitely would have helped here.

Oodles of Noodles:  Really, this is just a stir fry of noodles, vegetables and whatever meat you choose.  The noodles are similar to shanghai noodles only a little closer to the size of spaghetti.  Good sized chunks of chicken but TONS of vegetables.

Mango Chicken:  Chunks of breaded chicken, your typical mango chicken sauce...and lots of it.  And again....TONS of vegetables (green/red peppers and raw onions) and the odd chunk of mango.  This could easily be renamed as 'Peppers & Mango' with the 5 little pieces of chicken I found.

My wife called them back 3 times to ask where our food was.  We would have been MUCH better off just cancelling and saving the $.  Which ended up being $40 of COLD food thrown in the green bin.

Sure most of us have experienced delivery problems in the past, but with that aside, I would highly recommend you save your $ and try somewhere else.  My gut feeling is that this place is going under and can't afford any meat, thus, the absurd amount of vegetables."}
{"text":"Quite disappointed with this restaurant. We wanted to try something close to our house but probably should have ventured out further.

Thai on the Danforth offers free delivery for over orders over $20 and they also throw in free springrolls and/or soup. Most of the dishes are all around $9.95 on the menu.

The pad thai noodles we ordered were hard and clumpy. It took much sawing effort from my knife to split them up. 

Although the basil chicken and red curry were OK, the dishes seemed to be lacking in flavour.

If you don't have high expectations and want to have a quick meal (service was alright), then give it a try. But, thanks to Yelp reviews, there are definitely better places around the City."}
{"text":"Order $150 of take out as this is around the corner from us. Your typical, cheap and generic Thai takeout restaurant. Nothing special, but decent. Service was fine. Would order again if in a rush and had a hankering for sweet and salty coconut milk bathed veggies."}
{"text":"Leaving behind the terrible service, let's talk about the food. 

The mango chicken is so sweet that they should call mango ice cream with chicken. The sauce was thick and glazy. 

The padthai is not very flavorful and had a strange after taste, hmmm

The so called samosas were terrible! Totally bland and hard to chew. 

The only good thing was the brown rice. At least it was cooked. 

Now back to the service, check your receipt, and do not let them haggle you! When did you ever see a haggling cashier? Weird."}
{"text":"The classic pad thai (chicken and shrimps) is good, though it has a lot more chicken than shrimps. But it is yummy!
I also ordered the spicy beef salad and it was average i'd say.
My order arrived in 45min as planned, so I can't complain about that!"}
{"text":"A frequently deserted, but generally quite tasty Thai shop.

It has been my experience that there are very few places that are good at all the facets of contemporary/urban Thai cuisine. Thai on Danforth is no different - their pad thai is somewhat ketchupy, and other \"saucy\" dishes are very saucy, and actually not very tasty.

However, their curries are exceptional, if not overly spicy. My wife, who is averse to spicy food, loves their red curry. And I love their Malay curries, which are a bit spicier, though both sauces are incredibly tasty. 

Other favourites are their spring rolls, which they serve with honey, and their satay, another Thai mainstay.

You can eat in very easily, as they're rarely busy, and most of the time can accommodate larger groups. Decor is spartan and mostly hand-crafted, and they do have air conditioning. Our favourite method of eating is to call ahead and walk over, since we live probably 5 minutes' walk away; food is ready when we get there."}
{"text":"Thai on the Danforth is a great little restaurant to visit. The decor is kinda cool with bamboo tiki hut theme. The food is what deserves the 3/5 stars. I enjoy their food more then other local Thai restaurants. Stop by give them a try, the service is great and cool little place for the locals... no need to travel."}
{"text":"New ownership (Summer 2010) = horrible food

I have been a faithful Thai On Danforth customer since it opened and have never been dissatisfied with dinners.  However with new ownership, the food isn't the same.  Not even close.  Thai On Danforth lost a great family of customers."}
