{"text":"Awful, slow and indifferent service.   It was the middle of the afternoon!  3 other people.  Wingz were just ok.  Had much better."}
{"text":"The food was decent, the service needs work. Hoping to come back and see some improvements in the service. It was the first week.  They were out of ham and other fixins."}
{"text":"We went about a week after opening and they were still getting in the swing of things.  It was a good remodel of the old Cousins but it is still a pretty small space which might cause issues for them going forward.  When we arrived it was fairly empty but shortly after we ordered the entire place filled up.  It did not seem like the staff were used to it being busy and service got pretty slow.   The burger was just okay, it didn't stand out much.  

The wings are probably the real reason to visit here.  They had had a very good flavor and they have a variety of unusual flavors.  One word of warning about the wings - although they were good the boneless wings were on the small side."}
{"text":"I (finally) made a trip to Wingz n' Things, and have to say it is well worth a visit. The staff was very friendly, and gave us samples of wing sauces, which helps. Because some of us favor hot sauces we selected the two hottest: Insanity (second hottest available) and Bi-Polar (the hottest). Both will satisfy lovers of a hot sauce. My son, who makes his own sauces for a Milwaukee rib house, thinks that Bi-Polar may be the hottest commercially available sauce he had ever tasted. I agree. For those who don't want an extreme sauce the Insanity fills the bill nicely. For folks who just want a nice, mellow wing the Garlic Butter is tasty. The wings themselves are meaty and filling. All-in-all a good stop for wings! The restaurant was clean, our waitress was attentive, and the location is convenient. I hope Wingz n' Things becomes a fixture in Sun Prairie."}
{"text":"Closed.  It wasn't bad food or unfriendly staff. Poor management killed this one."}
{"text":"Came in to Wings and things for a to go order and I was offered something to drink while I was waiting! It's a nice place with pleasant employees. The wings and fries for lunch we're very good. I'll stop in again"}
{"text":"I had never walked out of a food establishment till I went here. Absolutely horrible. Disorganized. Understaffed. Unsanitary. Customers had to bus their own table. The longer I sat there the worse it became. The waitress was in no way surprised we got up and left before we ordered. I predict they won't be open long."}
{"text":"service : 
A young lady who was our server was momentarily occupied but greeted us at the entry to the dining room and offered our choice of seat and brought menus, offered beverages right away.

She was very nice and sweet but unexperienced (also her first week) and not knowledgable about the menu or organized with her service (foreseeing likely requested items or suggesting sides (celery/bleu cheese) to reduce her trips and suggest things customers might have forgotten to order (celery/bleu cheese in our case).  She could greatly improve by opening the day with a list of anything theyre out of (after ordering, found out they were out of one of our sauce choices and easiest way was to speak to the cook who happened to be in the kitchen window and our next 3 choices were out).  The server needs knowledge about what ALL the sauces are.  She could offer her tasting experience of some of them, but many she hadn't tried and had no clue to describe them.  The owner/manager should take initiative and get her a cheatsheet, establish food abv. instead of writing longhand (asking us to see menu for how to spell the sauces....).

Unfortunately, she didn't have support for the small rush (3 other customers) and it took FOREVER for her to come take our order.  Thankfully, though starving, we weren't otherwise in a hurry.   For a server in a wing joint, she should know what \"bone-in\" means....whatever, she does now.... she's young and sweet... and her generation hardly knows meat comes from an animal which has bones..... not my first time encountering this... last time was a 40 something.  

Food:
Sauces were really yummy and I think house mixed.  Cant remember which we had....PBJ...plum...cant remember the other 2.   

Wings are average size, I think, but seemed to not have much meat on the bone.... it seemed shrunken (a lot of exposed bone) and the meat seemed a bit dry..... overcooked?  If after/durign eating the meat you like to get all the sauce off the bone by putting it in your mouth like a popsicle and pulling it out (you try describing it better)..... watch for cut, jagged bones on your lips !  They were plentiful!  

Cleanliness;
didn't notice anything unclean about front of the house.... it's all hard surface and appeared to be clean.... though as another reviewer said, the floor was tacky (likely caused by poor quality/wrong cleaning PRODUCT RESIDUE ..... NOT dirty... I work in janitorial management).  Not sure about men's, but ladies bathroom nearly qualified as filthy.  Sink and floor both need a scrubbing, toilet and dispensers etc were fine.  Just get some scouring powder and a toothbrush for the sink and I'd scrub the floor by handbrush but your employees would probably prefer deckbrush style ((tacky and dirty grout and grime in room corners).  Get a new floor mopping product.   Appears to be fresh paint in bathrooms.  The many inspirational sayings framed pictures is a nice touch.    

All in all, my boyfriend and I agreed we'd return.  Paid our server at the reguster desk (some people have expressed confusion on yelp  where to pay), found out it was her 1st week, wished her luck.  Nice place for a highschooler to start waiting tables... but she needs training. Attentive and sweet, but disorganized, unknowledgable."}
{"text":"this place is now closed as of the beginning of November 2016 so sad"}
{"text":"We decided to give Wings N Things another try at their Sun Prairie location. First we were told that they were out of the first 2 things I tried ordering. I decided on just some standard wings since they were having 50 cent wing night. Unlike any other wing place though, I was told I couldn't order as many as I felt hungry for but rather must order in increments of 10. I was also informed I couldn't order half & half with my sauces on the wings. Apparently you must choose 1 sauce flavoring for your order. Then the wings came out, looking like the smallest wings I'd ever seen! I left hungry, unsatisfied, & vowing to never return. My wife enjoyed her burger but couldn't believe the \"wings\" I was served. She was also charged $1.50 just to add onions onto her burger! I've never been told \"No\" so many times by a server when trying to order. I'm joining the rest of Sun Prairie in ignoring this place."}
{"text":"I figured with the focus on Chicken it would be amazing! I will say the sauces are good! I don't understand when you order to go why you can't get naked boneless wings and order sauce to try - makes no sense. The Boneless Wings were nothing more than chicken nuggets with pressed meat gross. The regular wings were decent - the Bipolar not hot at all and they charge more is dumb."}
{"text":"Wow!!! This is a disaster. When you walk in, you are not greeted and unsure where to go, since there is no hostess station, or signage as to where you should wait. The restaurant had only one other table, but numerous Tables were dirty. We were in after 2pm, so the lunch rush had been gone for a while (no excuse for all the dirty tables).  Once we sat the server greeted us promptly, but after taking our order she never came back to check on our food or see if we needed refills. While we ate, I noticed how dirty everything was. If the front of house is this dirty, what does the kitchen look like???? The decor is blah, it looks like a middle schooler's room threw up on the walls. The food is nothing to write home about. The burger is grass fed beef, but there was no seasoning and it was extremely greasy. The boneless wings were small, the sauce was fine, but I am pretty sure they were straight out of a Tyson bag. They were overprice and over processed. I will not revisit this place. So sad, with a little effort this place could have worked. 

P.S.
Tell your cook not to eat in plane sight of the customer. Not sure why you wear latex gloves and feed your face. GROSS!"}
{"text":"My family and I have gotten to-go orders here at least 6 times by now since the beginning of the year and the wings are good every time. Being from Alabama, we had not found a good wing place that was similar to a couple of our favorites back home..... and Wingz-n-Things is definitely going in the right direction. 

We always order traditional wings seasoned with lemon pepper and medium hot with lemon pepper added. You have to try that last combination. So good. We tried the honey mustard which are also good (really anxious try some with some of the hot buffalo sauce on the side for dipping). Honey BBQ were also pretty good. 

We will be coming to them whenever we are looking for good wings. The fries leave more to be desired. Sometimes they are overcooked. It's not a deal breaker but it does leave a little hesitation to order them since the kids love fries.

Other than that, the staff are decent. Any issues with our order, we had they solved right away and even gave us a coupon to come back. I love that you can now order from then on EatStreet, which means I can collect my rewards and pick up some good wings when I am in the area."}
{"text":"Service was okay but confusing. All servers were NICE but not necessarily good at providing service. Wasn't sure who to talk to upon arrival and was not sure where to pay. 

Beer list was impressive, but they were out of some of the good ones. This is a soft opening, so understandable if things are out of stock due to more business than expected.

FOOD: Boneless wings (Kung Pao) tasted like over-processed frozen \"meat\". they were like breaded chicken meatballs with lackluster sauce. The traditional wings (I had bourbon bbq sauce) were much better, but still pretty blah. Mozzarella sticks could have come off the Swan's truck. Cheese curds were good and the only thing my party of four speculated we would return for.

The place was cute. Nice job on the remodel. The TV placement is strange - would be better to spread them out a bit instead of all three right next to each other so more patrons would have a view.

What I couldn't get over was how DIRTY the place was. Maybe they've been so busy that they haven't had a chance to procure a mop.  They should. My shoes stuck to the floor. There was visible grime throughout the seating area.  The bathroom (women's at least) was disgusting and cold. 

If the front-of-house was so poorly cleaned I don't want to imagine what the kitchen looks like."}
{"text":"Generally disappointed. Wings were pretty cheap, but small, many were broken, and a few of the sauces we tried were really bland. I was extremely disappointed that the wings didn't come with any ranch, blue cheese, or celery; each were an additional $.50, not much, but those are things that should be standard inclusions... Go to BWW instead"}
