{"text":"Being a hk cafe, taste comes first before service or overall environment. Unfortunately, the food quality is definitely below average. Ordered the korean beef rice and pork neck with egg for lunch. Portion was decent however both dishes lacked flavour. Bland and boring... Probably won't be returning because there are much better cafes at the same price or less"}
{"text":"First things first, their info on yelp is already wrong as I sit in here now and see on Yelp that their status is \"closed\"... get it right people.  Came here with 2 other friends and literally each dish came only when the first dish was FINISHED before the next one would come.   Orders were mixed up, staff has no idea what is what on the menu, completely confusion.  And as a HK style restaurant, they have no set dinners is something unheard of...   Maybe they need a rude awakening before people would come back because I sure won't, soooo many different places in Markham that are better then this!"}
{"text":"Finally, a restaurant I like opened at 16th Ave and Markham, no need to drive all the way to Hwy 7 anymore, foods taste good and staffs are excellent in customer service.  Yay!!!"}
{"text":"Went for the breakfast combo (6.99) served from 7am-11:30am. You can select from a variety of combinations which comes with a side + butter bread, the main meal choosing your choice of meat and noodle and your choice of hot beverage.  For the sides I opted for hot dog with 2 eggs and buttered toast. For my main meal i got satay beef with spaghetti and hot milk tea. . You can't go wrong with fried eggs and hot dog. The satay beef and spaghetti noodle soup was decent and not too salty. The spaghetti was chewy and fresh and the hot milk tea was simple in which you add your own sugar.  For 6.99, the breakfast combo was very filling and a decent price. But nothing special from any other Hong Kong cafe. Also their menu does not offer congee"}
{"text":"This Japanese named Korean house is actually a hong kong style restaurant. The prices are pretty good, I often go for their breakfast and they have a combo that's 6.99. Some of the old new city restaurant workers came here, and I suspect that the chefs did too cause the ham omelette taste just as it used to at new city. I have yet to try their lunch or tea or dinner menu, but I'm sure it's just as worth it as the breakfast"}
{"text":"This place is legit HK style cafe. With a meal you'll get soup and a drink (usually milk tea or lemon tea). Friendly services and really airy environment compared to the other HK cafe. Seating is very comfortable. Food costs slightly more on regular items or equivalent on the fancier items. Flavor and menu varieties are their strong suits."}
{"text":"The \"hot pot\" is a bit expensive - take away the burner-lit mini wok and it's basically just instant noodles with a couple thin slices of beef, a quarter piece of corn on the cob, and a couple other rando items.  Place seems packed during weekend dinner times, so maybe best to come a bit early (ie: 6:30pm-ish) to beat the rush if you're interested in trying it."}
{"text":"Very good service, nice TVs up. Its more of a chinese restaurant thats korean inspired. Great booths to sit in, if you like those! Price is a little bit more expensive compared to other chinese restaurants but the quantity and quality was worth it."}
{"text":"An Elite friend wrote a review about this restaurant and so my husband wanted to give it a try. A company of three ordered three dishes, vegetables on oyster sauce, Hainanese chicken and sizzling hot plate with assorted steaks.  Vegetables on Oyster Sauce (score 3.5/5) The dish is pretty small for $5.99. There's no oil on the vegetables. Looks like the vegetables were boiled to cook.  Hainanese chicken (score 4/5) The dish looks impressive when it comes. I do see a little bit of blood in the bones.  Sizzling Hot Plate with Assorted Steaks (score: 4/5) It comes with a bowl size of rice . There are quite a lot of meat. Also, a lot of fat in the meat. The sauce tastes  great but a bit salty. I could taste the garlic flavour in the sauce. But the iron plate got cooled very soon."}
{"text":"HK Cafe | Breakfast | Lunch |   Service was a bit slow. We ordered two cold drinks but wasn't sure why it came separately.  I know they're still new and probably training bit it wasn't nice to hear the manager yell at a server \"who did table 15!? Why didn't you wipe it? .. why is there no utensils on table 21!? Who did that?\" Maybe you should do it at the back ...  Cold HK style milk tea and Cold Ying Yeung Pretty smooth and fragrant.   Combo soup Cream soup was decent. We weren't given a choice though. It's creamy not too watery and came with a piece of bacon.  Meat sauce on spaghetti Typical, not very exciting. Sprinkled with parmesan cheese since it's not baked.  Teryikaki pork neck on rice with fried egg  Presentation was nice but we asked for half raw egg so you get the running yolk on the rice but we got a cooked egg. The rice and pork was decent.  Overall I'd suggest this restaurant to others bit nothing amazed me here."}
{"text":"Name is misleading, this is definitely a hk style cha Chang tang. I swear the most Korean thing you can get here is Korean instant noodles. The food isn't bad though, especially their more traditional hk style dishes. Portions are generous and filling and menu does have quite a bit of variety. I wasn't a fan of their instant noodles thst came with a slice of processed cheese, but again I shouldn't have expected more. It's nice to have more Asian food choices in this neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"I was really excited when I heard that a Korean restaurant was opening up on the north east end of Markham - I could grab some kalbi short ribs or satisfy my bimbap urges without needing to head to North York... But after several visits, I'm sad to report I'll probably still need to be making those treks.   First, don't be fooled by the sign that advertises it as a \"Korean house\". Despite the window signage, it's a Chinese diner that has 75% HK diner food. Fine. I like HK diners, but is it any good? After eating here 3x in the week it's been open, I can honestly say: meh.  Let's start with the good: nice modern decor, big tv flat screens, lots of tables, etc. The menu is extensive with familiar items of traditional HK cafes, as well as some \"Korean - style dishes\". I also like how the booths have USB power outlets so you can charge your devices.  Now the bad: I tried their sizzling steak and chicken combo and it's generous to say it was underwhelming.  First, the soup was supposedly a seafood bisque - it would be more accurate to call it Brown water with cornstarch to thicken it. No amount of salt or pepper could ressurect any sort of flavor.  The steak and chicken were fine but then the complimentary ice cream was melted upon delivery.  Wtf?  On a later visit I tried the bbq pork and egg with rice. Very standard for HK diners: slices of bbq pork laid over rice with a fried egg right? Not here. I got a BBQ pork omlette, which was fine, but a kind of surprising take on a classic.   And in all time there, service has been abysmal. I'm use to Chinese level service trust me, but I practically have to beg them to get a refill on my tea, check on the status of my dish, or bring me the bill. They're not busy either! They just aren't trained to care.  My final conclusion? This place has a lot of potential. The food is fine and the prices aren't bad...unless they serve melted ice cream again.  I'm going to make the generous assumption that the fubars I experienced are growing pains.  I'll give it another go in a month to see if they got the bugs worked out."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the name. It's a Hong Kong style cafe. The food is decent for the price. Average food for good value. Service is so so like all good HK cafe. If you live nearby and want some spicy instant noodle for cheap, this is the place.   I would make it a 3 star but the name really doesn't match the restaurant. A Japanese name, but a Korean house, but actually serve HK food?"}
{"text":"This Hong Kong style cafe is one of my new go-to's for places to eat tea time and dinner. Love the staff here, always so nice and give great service, and the food here is good, with affordable prices.   They have a lot more options and different food styles than other cafes, which I really like. I've tried 2 of their Korean mini hotpots (Kimchi Pork Belly and Beef Hotpot) and both have left me full and satisfied. They both come with a lot of ingredients (beef, veggies, fish balls, etc.) and instant noodles.  Their happy hour (tea time) comes with a drink, and their dinner combo comes with a drink and soup as well.   One of my favourite HK cafes."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner.  It was busy, I guess a lot of ppl want to try it out. Got the Korean meat rice in the stone bowl and a Korean hotpot.  The Korean meat rice in the stone bowl was good, it is not spicy, they give u hot sauce to add.  The Korean hotpot ($16.99) is overpriced with limited ingredients, mostly cabbages in the pot, not worth it.  Overall, food is good, price is average, ambient is good, service is slow."}
{"text":"Although this HK cafe style restaurant has not been around very long, it is already extremely popular with people coming to eat at all times of the day. If you want to avoid the lineup, come during weekday lunch or dinner times. There aren't many restaurants in this area like this one so it has been long awaited by residents! The price is very fair for now, with lunch specials from $7.99-10.99 and afternoon tea for even cheaper. I recommend trying the Korean Kimchi Udon for afternoon tea as it is quite unique and delicious! The Marshmallow Toast is also, but really sweet and they use Nutella, so don't get it if you are allergic to hazelnut. I will definitely become a regular here as it is a great option for a fast meal."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner tonight.   Place seems to have a Japanese name but says it's a Korean place but it is an HK cafe with maybe 5 Korean items.   Didn't see kalbi on the menu but might have missed that.  Staff was friendly and attentive clearing plates and were courteous.  They have 2 soups (usual hk borche and cream) unfortunately ran out of borche and it was only 6pm.  Ordered the sizzling plate and a Ramen.    Ramen was a bit small especially for $11.99 but there were 4 good pieces of pork belly with lots of flavour.  The bowl that they use is very slim at the base so you don't get as much content.    Egg was over cooked so didn't get that nice runny yolk.  Sizzling plate , although when they poured the sauce to make it sizzle they poured in one spot, a lot of the chicken just stayed dry from sauce.   Surprisingly the chicken was actually really good, and portion was actually huge (good to share).  Place is still new,and is quite clean.   Because of how close they are, would give them another chance."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good HK style western cooking lunch place by far in this neighborhood.  We came on a Thanksgiving Monday. Servers are experienced they worked at other HK style restaurant before. Speedy service, special lunch and breakfast menu. They forgot to give us special menus so just ask for them during lunch and breakfast hours.  Note: a menu also posted outside the window, be sure to check them out? Busy lunch time We arrived.  It is so called Korean Restaurant, however it offers HK style food, Japanese Ramen and Korean signature items. I would say it is a Chinese-Jap-Korean Fusion Cuisine.   To evaluate a fusion restaurant , I haven't try Korean and Japanese items therefore my rating is based on only the food we tried today.   Food are 4/5.  Service are 3/5. No cutlery, no table setup and unfinished cleaning table before directing customers to the seating ~ bad impression before ordering.  Cleanliness 3/5   One score lost on food because the Milk tea base is not the greatest I had ever tasted. If other sugar choices can be provided that would be great. Such as brown sugar, or honey etc on a side  Two scores lost on service and cleanliness because of the server did not make a proper table setup before sending customers and no cutlery.  Pretty good value and got left over to take home as well. We keep our minds and will give them another chances to improve things I would look forward.   Thank you for reading my yelp!:)"}
{"text":"Love their udon texture as its chewy! Also love their french toast cubes - sooo satisfying. A good quick hk style cafe to check out!"}
{"text":"This was our first time trying Matsuya.  It's a bit far, but there was ample parking.  The staff were friendly and all speak English.    We ordered the baked pork chop with tomato sauce on rice, and pork chop with onion sauce and egg on rice.  As mentioned here on Yelp, the baked pork chop on rice is not your typical HK style with tomato sauce.  It was definitely more like BBQ sauce and very tangy.  The rice was a bit sticky, so I'm not sure if that is normal, or the rice was just cooked with too much water.    The borscht soup was basically a tomato based soup, but more watery.  I found it a bit too salty.    The pork chop with onion sauce and egg on rice was quite tasty.  I would definitely order it again.  We'll have to come back and try their afternoon tea."}
{"text":"As compare to others Chinese restaurants in the neighborhood, I give it a 5 stars. Foods are good in general and very experienced waitresses which make such a big difference."}
{"text":"We've gone to their ayce japanese restaurant and it was better. There is really nothing special about the menu here. Sorry."}
{"text":"This is a Japanese Korean restaurant owned and operated by Chinese staff.  Food is quite delicious with a lot of variety. No sushi here but the food is decent, should try the ramen, simple but fulfilling!"}
{"text":"Having frequented the plaza where Matsuya is located, I wanted to give this place a try after seeing their cheap prices on the menu! The breakfast combo was only $6.99 and contained bread, eggs, bacon, noodles and milk tea so I definitely wanted to check it out. However, one thing I must say (like other yelpers below) is that this is not a korean restaurant. It is a HK style cafe that contains certain fusions so be careful!  [LOCATION] Located near Cora's and a big Garden Basket, it may be hard to spot but there is tons of parking.  [SERVICE] As any typical HK \"fast-food\" style restaurant, the servers are fast and straight to the point. Food comes out right away. The only downside is that this may create an unpersonalized visit. Furthermore, because most of the servers speak cantonese and limited english, language barriers may exist.  [PRICE] Breakfast is VERY cheap. I've attached photos to see what $6.99 can get you -- and because of that, the place is packed on weekend mornings! Wait times are normally 10 minutes to get a spot. Also, note that the breakfast combo comes with a variety of choices for drinks, soups and mains.  [TASTE] Because of the cheap price, the food served is not out of the ordinary and tastes just like a simple HK style breakfast. The milk tea was nice, the bacon was good and the eggs were done well (albeit kind of runny). Note that this meal can get oily!! However, my macaroni soup only tasted like salt which was disappointing :( On the other hand, my mom's vermicelli was pretty good!   Overall, I would come again if craving a simple HK style breakfast for a cheap price and fast service."}
{"text":"This place was a very lovely surprise!  A clean and quiet hk cafe in north east markham. A great addition.   Came here during tea time. Saw some ladies that used to work at New City cafe. They recognised us and greeted us. They have many booth seats with plugs to charge your phone. Booth seats are so comfy and offer privacy! A huge plus!   A server recommended the fried chicken leg and fries from the tea time menu. We dont usually order fried chicken legs, but we went with her suggestion. No regrets. It was so crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Server told us fries are the same as Costco.   Great experience with good dining experience. Will visit again."}
{"text":"Service was extremely lacking and even though the place was half empty on a weekday during peak lunch hours. I had heard great reviews about this place, so I came in with high expectations. But I found the prices to be average, not that competitive considering other HK style cafes in Markham/Richmond Hill. The food was extremely underwhelming, with small portions and poor quality of food. The rice used in both of our meals were just plain white rice and the amount of protein was also very little. There was a small slice of preserved carrot but that was all the vegetables in our bowl. The other items on the menu were quite pricey for a simple lunch and it tries to be \"Korean\" and \"Japanese\" but it's just a HK style cafe at the end of the day, trying to diversify."}
{"text":"Speed Read: 1) Nicely furnished HK style Café with large TV 2) ~$10 for Afternoon tea with tax and tips 3) Honey Garlic Chicken Wing - so so. 4) HK style tea - Too bitter and weak aroma.  Afternoon Tea - I want good HK style tea!! Fail! I was disappointed with the so-so tea.  Tea taste is too weak, yet more bitter than usual.  Honey Garlic Chicken Wing 1) Freshly deep fried.   2) I didn't taste any honey....maybe sugar syrup? 3) I don't know how to make the best HK style honey garlic chicken wings, but I remember I had better one elsewhere. 4) $10 with tax and tips....a little too much in my opinion.  Up your quality and I am more than happy to pay more than $10.   The shining part of this place is the furnishing and nice big TVs (3 of them).  I feel very comfortable enjoying my afternoon break. The only problem.....why CP24?? Isn't there anything better to show?"}
{"text":"Came here with some friends for a casual dinner after work. I was pretty intrigued when I saw that it was classified as Korean on yelp even though all the pictures showed Hong Kong style café food. Forget what the classification on Yelp says, this place is a straight up Hong Kong style café with maybe a few fusion dishes. Anyway let's get into it.  Our table ordered 4 dishes: a striploin steak on a sizzling platter (12oz), a pork neck special teppan, a duck breast special teppan, and a teriyaki chicken rice.  Striploin Steak (12oz) - Ordered by my friend. Pretty standard steak, nothing special. My friend asked for rare because places like this usually overcook the steak a little. He was right and the steak arrived medium rare (which is what he actually wanted). The order came with bread, soup, vegetables, potatoes, rice and your choice of sauce (my friend chose gravy). I personally felt that, for what you got, the steak was a little overpriced at $21.99. Overall, the steak was decent - not bad, but not spectacular.  Pork Neck Special Teppan: Ordered by me. In addition to the pork neck I chose to add cheese, raw egg, bacon, and mushrooms. The teppan arrived at our table sizzling hot and the waitress mixed around the rice, pork neck, and add-ons to ensure that everything was thoroughly heated. The pork neck was quite tasty, however I would not recommend getting any of the add-ons. The \"cheese\" was a measly square of processed cheese placed on top of the rice. Instead of a raw egg, they gave me a fried egg that was more or less well done. To make things worse, they just straight up forgot my bacon and I had to ask for it a few times. This could've been a great meal, but the whole experience with the cheese, egg, and bacon made it a little unpleasant.   Duck Breast Special Teppan: Ordered by my friend. No add-ons. Same deal as the pork neck teppan in terms of how it arrived and how it was presented. I didn't get to try a piece of the duck breast, but I remember my friend saying how it tasted more like ham than duck breast and wasn't really impressed.  Teriyaki Chicken Rice: Ordered by my friend. It looked and smelled pretty good, but it was definitely on the smaller side. My friend finished the whole thing in 5 minutes and wasn't full after eating.   At the heart of it, Matsuya is just an average Hong Kong style café. I think they have a lot of potential to be a great café, but they'll need to do make some adjustments to their portion sizes, service, and pricing if they want to compete with the big boys (like New City Restaurant).   Tl;dr - Nothing special. Wouldn't mind coming back if I'm in the area, but wouldn't go out of my way to eat here on my own."}
{"text":"Don't let the name fool you - this is actually a Hong Kong style café. Nicely decorated with great food.   The vegetable soup is flavorful with tons of veggies and is thicker than average.   Meat Sauce Spaghetti - not baked, and the cheese is sprinkled parmesan, not melted, but nonetheless delicious!   Baked Pork Chop Rice - pork is juicy and tender. The sauce is quite sour, BBQ-sauce style rather than the pure tomato-based version. Fried rice base using a shorter grain rice.   Portugese Beef Rice - really good, can taste the coconut in the sauce!  Satay Beef Vermcelli - good   French Toast Bites - the bites are huge, more like large cubes, covered in condensed milk. Outside is crispy, can taste a bit of the oil; Inside, some parts are soggy, but overall a good dish to share.   Hot Milk Tea - personally i think this could be stronger & milkier."}
{"text":"I cannot in good faith give Matsuya more than 2 stars in their current state as much as I love their staff and location. I hope their owner takes note of constructive criticism to improve their restaurant drastically.   VENUE/AMBIANCE (3 stars) This is a fairly large sized restaurant located in the corner of the Garden Basket plaza on Markham and 16. Probably seats 40-50 people. Parking is abundant. They have several TVs that simultaneously play CP24 (Is there anything else they can play???).  As many others have noted, this clearly Hong Kong style cafe has a Japanese name and calls themselves a Korean House. I have no idea who's doing their branding but nothing makes sense. They should really just pick one cuisine and stick with it.  SERVICE (3 stars) Courteous staff uncharacteristic of Chinese establishments in the Markham area. Everything else is slow. Food was slow. Drinks were slow. An afternoon tea that could have easily taken 45 minutes took over 1.5 hours! We were starving by the food arrived. It's been several weeks since they've opened so I expect their kitchen staff to be running smoothly by now. Also, after taking our orders, the waitress came back with utensils (fork and spoon). We all ordered noodles, so I'm not sure how they expected us to eat this. Apparently it's their policy to provide forks and spoons every time. (Why?)   FOOD (2 stars) I ordered a \"Korean Style Pork Chop Instant Noodle\". First, I don't know where they got Korean from. The soup base was a watery pork bone soup. The pork chop was over-marinated and too sweet and too salty at the same time. The instant noodles were just instant noodles, not even shin ramyun. There were no veggies or other seasoning. I barely finished half before I gave up. Their pork belly ramen was disappointing as well. Whose idea was it to serve unseasoned, hard boiled eggs with the ramen? Pork bone soup base was bland and watery as well. I will commend them, however, on giving three slices of pork belly.   The iced milk tea was standard offering. I will note drinks are not included in the dinner menu. Patrons have to pay for drinks individually, on top of their already pricey meals.   QUALITY/VALUE (2 stars) Afternoon tea is around 7.99 (+ $1 for cold drinks), which is around the same as other HK cafes in the area if not more expensive. Dinner menu is ridiculously expensive for quality. I don't think this location or their food quality warrants the inflated pricing.  OVERALL 2.5 stars"}
{"text":"So, I nursed an adult baby grudge against this place because we saw the sign long before it opened and prematurely celebrated a korean restaurant coming to the area only to realize that it really isn't authentic korean.  It's an HK style cafe with korean influence.  Eventually, we did try it....twice now.  Darn it, it's good.  The interior is clean and bright.  Booth seating has electrical and USB outlets.  We've tried: Baked Portuguese Chicken - a little too saucy and coconutty for our taste Spaghetti with meat sauce and cheese - thumbs up from the kiddo Pork chop ramen - nice broth, a lot of noodles and meat.  Also has corn and a boiled egg Steamed chicken -  good Beef with udon - a little sweet but generous helping and tasty  Friendly and quick service.  Lots of parking available."}
{"text":"It's more like a Hong Kong style café, but add a hint of Korean flavour... like using korean instant noodles instead of regular instant noodle  Familiar faces as many staff are from New City Restaurant, but New City is way better!!  Menu is much more limited compared with other HK style café.  Hong Kong style milk tea is not good, not even the hot lemon tea... so the tea itself is bad."}
{"text":"This place is more spacious then their Scarborough's location, and they serve Korean fusion food as well.  Modern décor.  There is a long bar table facing the street, and USB outlets at every booth.  Staffs are welcoming and friendly.  Food is absolutely good!"}
{"text":"At first with the store name, I thought it was a Japanese place then I found out is a Korean fusion kinda restaurant, however it seems to me like HK with some Korean fusion type of cafe...   I came on their first week opening I believe since I saw all those bouquet of flowers.... I was greeted promptly and was sat at one of the table in the spacious cafe....  I ordered the grilled pork chop with Korean ramen and chose my Milk tea as my drink of choice. It took over 25 mins for my order to arrive, it wasn't even pack so I guess just really slow service. The food was ok, nothing too special to be honest, however, this location is like 5 mins walking distance from my house, therefore it's not too bad! Since I have a very close HK like cafe now to the addition when I don't have a car!  I only got to try one thing so I cannot comment much about how good they are except for what I ordered, the soup was good, the ramen texture wasn't soggy, the best part was the grilled pork chop, was really soft and well flavoured. I would give it a 6.5/10.  I would come back again to try some of their lunch specials.  Improving their service time or faster deliver the food to the table might improve a lot. Maybe food presentation wise as well, seen some come out not as pretty as in pictures."}
{"text":"3.5/5  Matsuya is owned by two ladies who used to work at New City before their management changed. Despite the name, it is a HK style cafe restaurant foremost, with some Korean and Japanese elements to some popular HK style dishes.  I went here twice during my recent visit, once for lunch and once for happy hour. There's not really a lot of food options during those times, though AFAIK there's more options for dinner.  The first time I had the sliced pork belly ramen, and the second time I had the grilled pork chop in soup with Korean instant noodles. I found the ingredients for both items to be really good, but their noodles were overcooked both times. Obviously nothing compared to their Japanese and Korean counterparts, but for less than $10 it did its job.  Iced lemon tea also reminded me of New City in the past couple of years; the first time it was really good, the second time they didn't use high quality tea.  Service can be slow here. The first time it took almost 20 minutes for my order to come out, but the second time was faster.  The Northeast area of Markham is lacking in HK style cafes, so overall this place is a welcome addition. Definitely won't say it's the best in the city though, but a good neighbourhood cafe nonetheless."}
{"text":"A clean and spacious HK style cafe. Some of the items on the menu have a Korean fusion aspect, hence the name of this restaurant, but they don't serve real Korean food!  I like that you can get typical HK Cafe items like pork chop instant noodles but on Korean instant noodles (ask for spicy if you want the spicy Korean soup base). The curry fried porkchop omurice on the regular menu is pretty good - I like that the rice inside the omelette is tomato fried rice. The French toast bites also excellent because they cut them into bite size and fried them all around - only recommendation would be to drain the oil better before serving as the bottom pieces were overly oily. Some people don't like their HK milk tea because they prefer a stronger/ more concentrated black tea base, but I actually like that their black tea base is not so strong (too much caffeine makes me uncomfortable). There's room for improvement though as some items are not that great - stir fry black pepper beef noodle was tasteless."}
{"text":"Slightly over priced for what they offer. Really a Hong Kong style fast food joint.  The Korean fusion idea just shows up on paper. Don't expect your food to taste anywhere looked Korean. Good quality itself is good. Place is clean. Service is efficient. But above the price range of other HK still fast for joints.  The fact that they have alcohol is a pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"Had been seeing this place in the corner of the plaza for a while, and it finally opened! As with all grand opening places, do expect to have a little patience with the wait time as it does tend to get busy (which is a good thing!). Servers were very nice and experienced. None of them are standing there just idling. Everyone is also on their feet moving around. The ambiance looks refreshing and cheerful.   The food was very good as well. My favourite has to be the Red Braised Pork Belly with Rice ($8.99). If you are into fatty food, this is perfect for you. The Seafood with Fusilli in Rose Sauce ($9.99) was also very flavourful and the presentation of it looks great.   Can't wait to come back and try more of the menu. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Foods and drinks were bad at my first visit already.  At the second visit, I found my food have hair inside and asked for exchange. The waiter refused me to exchange another item (I were avoid they gave me back the same dishes).  After few minutes, they really provide me the same dishes by just taking out the hair only!!!! That's disgusting!!!  I just paid and go!!  Terrible experience!!!"}
{"text":"The best value meal there is their morning specials of Hongkong style breakfasts. For just $6.99 you can get any combinations of  eggs, sausages/ luncheon meats, toasts, milk tea, and a big bowl of spaghetti/rice noodle/macaroni in delicious bone broth and your choice of braised beef, luncheon meat, or sausages...the combinations seem endless and I can't see myself getting bored with them! A friend of mine highly recommended this place and I was not disappointed! All the flavors are satisfying and I was truly stuffed and still feeling full till the early evening. The service is quick and friendly. You might have to be prepared to line up a bit if you have more than two people coming in. The wait is worth it and table turnaround time is pretty quick as well. One of the best Hongkong breakfasts around!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch/half tea in the neighborhood.  The name is kind of misleading; it sounded like another Matsuda (the ayce) but is actually an HK style cafe. They do offer several Korean-fusion dishes though. I have yet to try those.  The restaurant is tucked in the corner of the plaza, right where the Garden Basket grocery store is; lots of parking is available. Once you go inside the restaurant, the servers may not greet you right away because their high counter is packed with stuff so they can't really see you. You'll have to manoeuvre your way a little around the counter for them to see you (unless they're already running around so in which case they'll see you come in). You'll see what I mean when you go there. They are really nice and courteous, though. Service is efficient, which is always great, and it is quite spacious there so coming with a small group is ok.   I usually come here for their half tea. There's plenty of options available. You get the basics like noodles and deep fried stuff, including a few new others. My fave here is their (gigantic) deep fried drum stick, and their pork chop bun. The size of the drum stick is probably bigger than the size of your face (assuming your face is normal size). It's so nice and crispy on the outside, while the inside is juicy and tender. The fries that it comes with is also delicious; it's similar to the ones you get at Costco, not the cheap powdery ones. Same is with their pork chop bun. Very juicy and tender, and the bun that it comes on is crispy and soft. Very satisfying. If you're one to watch TV while eating, they have 4 or 5 huge tv's there!  Do pay this place a visit if you're ever in the area, or just looking for a bite (or two)!"}
{"text":"First off I'll say that this place has AMAZING decor for an HK cafe. It's clean and beautifully decorated. It's very modern looking from its purple seats to its flower decor.  I'll skip the Japanese, HK, Korean thing since its already been more than established by other yelpers. The menu items are pretty much the same as any HK cafe, but some of the typical classic dishes have been swapped with some Korean and other fusion ones.  We ordered from the happy hour menu; spaghetti and fried pork chop with fries. The food was really good. I wasn't expecting the spaghetti to taste that good, but then again I almost never order spaghetti at an Asian restaurant.   The shortcomings of this experience were due to the bbt, and service delays. While the staff was friendly, food took forever to come out. It felt like there was only one waitress and one cook. My gf got her spaghetti 20 minutes before I got my pork chop. It was not a happy wait. Aside from that, their bubble milk tea was terrible. The milk tea itself wasn't too bad but the taste was off, and the pearls were chalky and stale. That was pretty unsatisfying since HK milk tea is one of my favourites.  In the end, I'd probably come back. The food was good and the atmosphere was nice (not noisy like most HK cafes). They just need a little bit of tweaking."}
{"text":"came with my family and ordered a few items to share. has a japanese name, but it's more like an hk style cafe, tbh. ordered eel omurice, spaghetti with meat sauce and cheese, the matsuya basket, and some korean beef udon dish.  i really liked the eel omurice. eel was very flavourful and tender.has some sweet and tang to it. spaghetti was nice but the cheese was i believe just some parmesan sprinkled on top. i would've preferred a molten mozza or cheddar on top. the matsuya basket was alright, they didn't have calamari though, so they subbed it with spring rolls. everything in the basket is the same colour lol. the korean beef udon dish was alright. maybe my least favourite out of everything ordered, but it wasn't bad. just personal preference."}
{"text":"Ordered a ginger pork rice for around $10 which was literally 4 slices of pork belly on a big bowl of plain white rice. Was in shock when it was served. Guess I picked the wrong item on the menu, wouldn't recommend this dish."}
{"text":"Parents heard good things about his place so we decided to go there for dinner. At first when you show up, the name suggest that it's a Japanese resturant. So ok, let's try it. Then once you get closer, the said \"Korean restaurant\" ok fine, no Japanese, let's have Korean. Then you sit down and have a look at the menu, you go \" hum..... This is not a Korean restaurant, it's a hk style cafe\".   Owner, please, I beg you, read the review, change the resturant name and wording, it will bring you sooooo much more business. This could have been a 4 star review but your name made it 3 star.  Anyways, back to the food, the food is pretty good based on hk cafe standard. The deco in the resturant is nice and new. The food comes out nice and hot. I got the steak with egg wrap rice. The Rince is the sauced rice. Egg is done correctly and the steak is pretty good with this dish.  4/5 but that name issue, 3/5....."}
{"text":"Matsuya Cafe is a great addition in the neighbourhood. I would not call this a Korean restaurant as it is really a Hong Kong Style Restaurant with some \"Korean\" fusion dish.   Opens 7 am daily for breakfast serving Hong Kong Cafe style breakfast. Then lunch and afternoon tea with the various  set that includes a drink.  Sadly dinner is all al la carte.   Spicy Minced Pork Bibimbap ($9.99) with braised fatty pork belly served in this sizzling hot pot. It is not spicy at all but if you want some heat, Korean hot pepper paste could be added.   Matsuya Special Steamed Chicken with Rice ($10.99) which is basically Hainanese chicken. It was just ok. Though the leaner free range chicken is used.  Price point is a little higher and the menu is quite different from their Scarborough location.  Since they just open a week or so, hopefully they can fine tuned their menu and service."}
{"text":"We heard that this restaurant recently opened at the old Italian Nonna's Restaurant. Thought we would give it a try. Not sure if the service is usually this slow, I'm gonna chalk it up to it being the long weekend. But seriously, since when does a lunch at a small Chinese cafe take over 2.5 hours?! It's not really Korean, maybe a tad influence with the kimchi fries...  Anyways, food was alright. My only complaint is the food didn't come at once. We got a meal every 30mins. So my party of three had to watch the other person eat while waiting on food that seemed to never come. Which sucks when you are hungry.   We ordered the fried pork bun sandwich (3/5) pork and steak on sizzling plate with spaghetti (4/5), honey garlic chicken wings and fries(4/5), and a Korean minced pork rice (3/5) bowl.  The prices were decent, ranges from $7.99-14.99 for their lunches.   Make sure you come to this restaurant with patience, otherwise you'd be fuming when you leave cause the wait time is seriously ridonkulous."}
{"text":"Came here on a busy Saturday afternoon. Luckily, it was just the two of us and we were seated shortly. I did get fooled by the name of the restaurant, thinking it was an authentic \"Korean\" restaurant. Recognized some of the staff from New City Restaurant and realized some of the menu items were also replicated. I didn't order any of the Korean food, instead ordered the Satay pork chop vermicelli and honey garlic fried chicken wings (a signature dish at New City). Nothing special about the vermicelli, and the wings were on the salty side but still pretty good. It's nice to have a HK style cafe closer to home, without having to drive to the core of Markham.   Don't expect to come here and receive exceptional service. The staff here barely smile at you, perhaps because they're so overly busy that they forget about customer service and hospitality. But then again, you typically get this type of service at most Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"The name of this place baffles me. It's an HK style cafe that offers Korean dishes. I came for breakfast on a Sunday just a little after 10:30am. There was a lot of people and a bit of a wait. We were seated just before 11:00am. It's a very loud restaurant but it suits the atmosphere.   My boyfriend ordered the Fish Fillet Cutlet + Eggs + Sweet Bun ($8.99) with an Iced Horlick and I ordered the Bacon + Eggs + Buttered Toast ($4.99) with a hot milk tea. Our total came to ~$17. The food was standard. I mean, our order wasn't anything complex so it would've been hard to mess that up!  The servers were very friendly. However, I am taking off a point because I originally wanted to order the Korean Sandwich, but they told me that it was too busy and they weren't making it at the moment. Subsequently, we decided we wanted to order either a Thick Toast or the Toast with Condensed Milk + Butter but I didn't know what the difference was. I asked the server but she told me that they are too busy and neither can be made at the moment. Again, they were sweet both times and I did see how busy it was, but that's not how a restaurant should operate. Especially if all three items are offered on your breakfast menu. I also wanted to order the deep fried cartilage (one of their specialties) but she told me it was only available after 11:30am and to flag down a server after this time to place my order (this wasn't on the breakfast menu so I understand, but just also wanted to make mention of it).   Overall, I did enjoy this and would definitely return. There are a couple of things I saw on the menu that were too heavy for breakfast so I'd like to try this place out for dinner as well."}
{"text":"This restaurant provides great service to their customers and are very patient with customer's orders. I ordered a ramen and it was delicious! It was great quality and the pork chop wasn't tough, it was very soft and it tasted amazing."}
