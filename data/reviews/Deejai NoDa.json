{"text":"The ramen short rib was awesome and hopefully they keep it on the menu after their grand opening."}
{"text":"I've been to eat here twice now for lunch and every time I'm shocked that it's not more crowded.  There is a $10 lunch special featuring 6 or 7 different dishes that come with a spring roll and a drink.  I ordered the drunken noodles this time, which came out fast and looked great.  They tasted as good as they looked, especially with the house cilantro lime hot sauce which added some delightful acidity. Both my coworkers were equally pleased with their Pad Thai and namprik.  There was so much food on the plate it was easily enough for two meals.  We took boxes of leftovers home with us.  For what we paid, it feels like one of the best lunch specials in town.  The wait staff is very attentive and helpful and our server even gave us drinks in to go cups at her suggestion.  It's in a bit of an out of the way corridor of NoDa near the construction, but very much worth the trip for the price and value.  There is parking in a lot out front which is very convenient.  I would definitely make this a destination for lunch, and dinner as well!"}
{"text":"Take caution if you're ordering out. Second time in a week we ordered take out only to get there and find out they ran out of something we ordered. They said they called back to let us know, but we never got a call. Been pretty satisfied with the food - we did order out from here twice in one week- but don't think we're going back after tonight"}
{"text":"Had an excellent experience on my first visit. I ordered the \"Drunken Noodles\" and it was absolutely delicious! I'll probably order it with a little less \"spicy\" next time but we had outstanding service and the food was even better. Thanks!!"}
{"text":"Not someplace I would visit again.  Service was awful. We were seated immediately.  Only 2 sets of utensils were left on the table. We had to ask for straws. There were four of us, 2 dinners arrived, it took 20 minutes for the second 2 dinners. We had to ask for additional utensils.  The Aztec and Kimchi bowls were good, the Pad Thai arrived piping hot.  With the Ba Mi Pad Hang, the duck was delicious, tasty and tender. The noodles were bland and marginally warm.  Had I not waited 20 minutes longer than 2 of my table mates, I would have sent it back to heat the noodles. After a wait of 15 minutes, the server came by and said the 2 hot dishes  would be out soon. After another 5 minutes we asked the manager to check on our food.  He got results and our food came."}
{"text":"I've lived in Charlotte for close to 9 years now...  and I have to say I love the city. It's large enough that it's not boring, but not overwhelmingly big.  The city has a decent selection of food... but after living in Milwaukee/Chicago for 15 years, I always felt some of the food was lacking - in particular, Thai food and sushi.  There are a few places around,  but until Deejai came along there was NO good Thai in Charlotte, and the good sushi was also, sadly, very spendy (at least for Charlotte).  Deejai has solved this problem...  and the new location in Noda is walking distance from our house. As a result, my wife and I have ripped through just about everything on their menu and nothing disappoints.  All of the sushi rolls are delish...  and noodle bowl favourites include Nam Prick, Drunken Noodles, and even \"plain old\" Pad Thai is fantastic the way they do it.  Always great, fresh ingredients and always as spicy as you want (or don't want).  Service is always solid and friendly, and although they don't have a ton of tap beers, they do rotate the ones they do have - usually local craft favourites. We can always find something we like to drink there."}
{"text":"My husband and I Stopped in for dinner and sat at the bar. We enjoyed the food but were very distracted and turned off by the way a manager/owner was treating the other staff members. She was marching back and forth having a complete tantrum in front of the almost full bar. We will not be take- there are plenty of other restaurants in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday night with a few friends. We were excited to try this new Thai place. The interior is cool and has a trendy vibe, and there is a bar as well as a sushi bar area as well.   I had the drunken noodles, which is my usual order if they don't have pad see ew. Although the flavors were there and they didn't shy away from spice which is something I appreciate, there were just too few noodles in my dish. I found myself hunting and digging within my vegetables to find the noodles to eat. I think they could have lessened the amount of bell peppers and broccoli a significant amount to find a better balance. I'd have to come here again to see if this was a fluke or if they consistently don't add enough noodles. This is why I'm giving it 4 stars, because if it is a fluke and they usually give more, it would be an excellent dish.   My friend had one of their curries which she did enjoy, although it wasn't the best she's ever had. She also ordered an avocado bubble tea and while it was good, it was definitely coconut flavored instead of the avocado she ordered. They also put whipped cream on top which was not completely necessary, but some might like it."}
{"text":"Love the look of the restaurant when you first walk in. The staff were very friendly and the food was delicious! Plan on coming back again."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I found this place after seeing the Groupon deal. After reading some of the reviews I had some concerns about service but thankfully there were no issues. We were greeted as soon as we entered and seated promptly. The server explained the drink specials for the day as well as answered any menu questions.  The not-so-good news: they were out of spring rolls! Needless to say I was disappointed as they are a staple to just about every Asian restaurant. But understanding that things happen, decided to go with the pork belly tacos and Thai chicken wings as appetizers. The tacos were the stand out of the two. The pork belly was just crispy enough like I prefer. The wings were good but average.  On to the sushi course. We ordered both the panther and honey honey roll. It was very fresh and tasty. I would have to say that I preferred the panther roll even though I'm not usually a hug fan of soft shell crab but the flavors were delicious! The honey honey roll was good too but more suited to someone looking for a more basic roll.  By the time the entrees came out we were stuffed and boxed them up to go. I was even more pleased when I went to dig into my box later that night. The spicy basil chicken and the drunken noodles with shrimp were as spicy as requested and flavorful. They work on the standard 5-star spicy rating system. We requested a 4 on both dishes and they delivered. The drunken noodles had ample shrimp and the noodles were cooked perfectly. The spicy basil was bursting with flavor while the jasmine rice complemented it well. Groupon may have lured me in but the food and service is what will bring me back!  Note: Parking is super tight so just be prepared."}
{"text":"Best Pad Se Eww I've had in CLT, hands down. Chill place and good service. Will be back to try other dishes. Check it out!"}
{"text":"I loved the ambiance and the service was excellent. Lisa was very friendly and provided great recommendations. They are still working on adding to the menu but had about a dozen different sushi rolls along with popular noodle dishes and other unique options.  I'm excited to have sushi and Thai options available in our hood. This place will definitely be our favorite spot!"}
{"text":"So excited to have this spot in NoDa now!  From the pineapple martinis to the kimchi poke bowl it was awesome.  Not to mention our server was great!  We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Deejai NoDa is such a cool concept.   I stopped in on Sunday afternoon and the food was good, however the service was a bit off.   The place was relatively empty when we arrived and we were seated right away. The hostess that took us to our seat, ended up being our waitress but she never introduced herself and seemed to be a bit confused about the menu and the overall service.   However, the service aside the food was pretty good. I tried the Honey Honey roll and the Drunken Noodles with shrimp. The sushi roll was just okay. It didn't wow me, but I think a few other places have spoiled me. However, it was very pretty when it arrived to the table.  The drunken noodles were very good. I ordered them with some modifications and a spice level #4 and would definitely order it again! They use nice size shrimp and all the flavors worked together so nicely. Plus, it arrived hot to the table pipping hot and I loved the flower! If you're debating what to try first - I'd recommend starting with this dish!   Overall, good presentation and good flavors! Once they work the service out this place has real potential."}
{"text":"Great experience! Loved our sushi roll, the thai chicken wings, thai crepe.. The spicy basil chicken is delish!!! The Duck pai thai was great but not really my speed so i didnt enjoy it as much.. Recieved great service from Viengsa! Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Rumor has it you come for the food but come back for the service and both are great here. We have been here several times and the service and food have been phenomenal. The dumplings are delicious and the wings are some of the best in the city. We will definitely be back...a lot."}
{"text":"Great new NoDa addition. Clean and modern environment. Sake and Asian beer selection is good. Food is fantastic! Knowledgeable Sushi Chef on site. The Ahi Poke bowl was excellent!"}
{"text":"Deejai in Noda was a great little spot to eat at with solid vibes. I had the short rib ramen, the dumplings, spring rolls and edamame.  For the drinks, I had their version of the Manhattan, and the dry sake flight.  Everything was great, and I really enjoyed the sauces they had for the ramen. Nice Touch!  One sauce was a spicy fish sauce and another was a spicy sweet sauce.    My fiance had the Midori sour, green lychee martini, and she enjoyed and her pad thai looked great.    Definitely check it out and my favorite part was the prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed eating here at Deejai Noda. The waiter and waitress kept refilling our cups of water continuously. Really nice atmosphere and the sushi we ordered was really really good. I normally don't eat sushi that's raw but the honey honey roll was just so damn delicious. Definitely coming back to this place to try their other foods!! This place is calling me back!"}
{"text":"On a freezing cold December night when it's late and not too many places are open, Deejai NoDa for the win.   Stopped in for dinner on a quiet night, restaurant wasn't too full. It is freshly made, well seasoned Thai food. I had the shrimp pad thai and it was really good. Lots of shrimp and the noodles were good.   Prices aren't bad either, I would return!"}
{"text":"Our order was placed pretty quickly when we arrived but our meal took 45 minutes to arrive to the table and was incorrect, but we were too hungry to send it back. During our 45 minute wait, our beverages, even though they were just water, were never refilled.  We saw another couple arrive, order, and pay their check through the duration of our wait. Also, when I approached our waitress about this, she said that everyone's wait was long and that our food would be out soon, no apology. The check was incorrect and we were charged for extra crab when my boyfriends dish contained no crab at all.   On top of that, the food was just ok, approaching subpar.  Save your time and money, just go to Thai Taste."}
{"text":"Wow the best Thai food I have ever had the curry was marvelous the chicken wings hot but oh so good and the deserts were a mango crepe were very good I so enjoyed this meal and ps the Sushi was real fresh and good"}
{"text":"Delish food, huge portions, somewhat slow to receive food but that allowed us to enjoy the half priced wine"}
{"text":"We went for dinner and I couldn't ask for better service! We were greeted immediately and then it so happens that our host became our server since the others were busy. He was beyond nice and helpful explaining the menu and what were the number one sellers. We tried the papaya noodle salad and the wings for appetizers they were both delicious! For entrees we tried the salmon curry soup and the pad thai. The curry soup was a little to salty but other than that it was good. The pad thai was amazing!! Not to sweet and not to spicy.  The best I've had in a while. We loved the food and atmosphere, we will definitely go back to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Very cool place. Best shrimp I've ever had. Pork and duck were also delicious. Highly recommend this place. Parking lot is small but there is street parking nearby."}
{"text":"Just another joint I can say I've tried.   My food was just okay.   I think it's a bit odd (is it just me) that hard boiled eggs are in the Ramen. The short rib joint was just okay. The flavor was a bit one dimensional. I think I'll stick to Futo for the Ramen.   The honey honey sushi was regular to me. Like something I've had at other places. I think I'll stick to Fujo for my Godzilla roll. That's my barometer for sushi.   So this is where things got a bit muddled....  My homie gets the lemongrass chicken dish and he wasn't feeling it because he said the ground up chicken tasted like it was chicken sausage, and the flavor was okay. So he ordered the pork chop with some rice and he ate a piece off the end. When he cut into it it was pink. He asked me if it was undercooked and I was like yea, it's too pink. So he sends that back. You don't want to play with undercooked Pork. The manager or owner maybe came through apologizing profusely and mentioned this is the second time this has happened. Uh oh!   They comped his meal and asked if he wanted anything else. He got the chicken wings. He said they were good. I saw a lady by us tearing her wings up! Like no meat left.  So because everyone was so caught up in how they messed up on my homies food, no one asked me how my food was.... if I needed anything... if I cared for any dessert.   I'm only speaking on my experience (clearly) and they did great with rectifying the situation with my homie, but that left me out of the picture. I wasn't looking for some free food or a constant stream of check ins. Maybe just \"how was your food ma'am?\"  I don't think i would have cared about that if my food was great, but because it was aight, my experience isn't soured, it's just eh."}
{"text":"Very good food. I've eaten here a couple times and tried 6 or so dishes, which were all good to excellent. Service has been suspect, but not so bad that it deters me from coming back."}
{"text":"We were next door at the Crown Station and we wanted a snack. Went next door and ordered edamame and spring rolls. When they were ready, they brought them to us at Crown Station. So delicious.  Hit the spot."}
{"text":"Really good Thai, always busy (cause its good) quick friendly service - 4 stars for a nice dinning experience.  Full bar, usually with drink specials. Outdoor seating. Order the chicken wings - so good!  They have sushi - which is not Thai but hey, who doesn't like sushi- I had the god father roll - amazing! Expensive but amazing ($16). And it was a very large roll.   My friend ordered the something prick - it's basically a rice bowl with the rice on the side - so it's classified as healthy. It was roasted chicken in a sauce ( clearish sauce) with veggies sautéed. It was really good and only $8.   They have beer on tap and a decent wine selection.  The menu is pretty vast, lots of choices. Great spot for friends to gather and eat and socialize.   I've been like 4x. Great food, good location."}
{"text":"Great Pad Tai!  Wait staff so friendly!  Nice ambiance,  overall good vibe.  Lots of customers for a mid week evening ... a sign of a good restaurant.  Location a little hard to find.   Will return for sure!"}
{"text":"Freaking delicious! I think this is now my favorite Thai place in Charlotte. We got a groupon here and initially thought that it was for the location on Providence Rd. but I honestly think this location is even better than the original.  We started with the spring rolls - these were hot and cripsy and the sauce that comes with them is sooo good, I could put that on everything.  For our entrees, we ordered the Drunken Noodles and Pad Thai.  I didn't love the Drunken Noodles - they come at a recommended level 3 spicy out of 5 which was much too spicy for me.  You can actually ask that it come less spicy but that is what is recommended.  The Pad Thai is wonderful! So flavorful, not too sweet.  Comes with lots of peanuts which really makes the dish for me.  For dessert I had the mango sticky rice.  It is SO good!  I have never had it before but thoroughly enjoyed it.  It's a mix of savory and sweet - a must try if you have never had it before. My only complaint would be that the service was quite slow, maybe they need more servers working."}
{"text":"Way overrated. The 4.5 stars it has is generous to say the least. If it wasn't in NoDa, people wouldn't  be nearly as generous.   It's obvious nothing is made from scratch, they use generic sauces and ingredients every other Asian fusion joint has sources from US Foods or IFH. Asian food for white people.  Prices are high and they're skimping out on food quality. We ordered seafood pad Thai and got 2 prawns and a couple extremely laughable and small pieces of calamari. On top of this, the portions are shrinking.   Environment is stripped minimalist. Again, interior fails to impress. Basic. Again, not spending any money."}
{"text":"I went here for a quick lunch.  The restaurant was great! Great vibe and great service.  My meal was prepared exactly how I ordered it. The dish came out fresh and hot.  There 2 stars is a little spicy so keep that in mind but it was just right for the Pad See You!   I will return for lunch and try another dish when I am in the area."}
{"text":"Love everything about them! EXCELLENT FOOD! I loved the drunken noodles and Pad Thai. Probably not spelling that right but beautiful atmosphere and very pretty there."}
{"text":"Overall, Deejai Noodle Bar in NoDa is putting out some interesting dishes in a cool space, but nothing about it knocked my socks off.  Pros: Interesting noodle dishes. I had the salmon curry. Tasty but I wouldn't get it again. The salmon was cooked perfectly but the thin rice noodles and thick curry sauce didn't work for me. The kimchi poke bowl was tasty. I'd get that again.   Cons: The parking lot is weird to get in and out of. Save yourself the headache and park around the building. Service was fine but nothing to write home about.   Glad to see the ethnic cuisine scene in Charlotte expanding. I'll definitely give them another shot."}
{"text":"Deejai NoDa has become our go-to spot for thai deliciousness.  Prior to Deejai NoDa, we would venture to various locations across the city for tasty thai - I don't think it's particularly hard to find in Charlotte.  But, what I love about Deejai NoDa is the addition of poke bowls and great service.  You can also order online and have it delivered next door to Crown Station or Divine Barrell - win/win!"}
{"text":"Excellent service - every plate we ordered came out so fast and our water glasses never were below half full and the restaurant was packed! We enjoyed everything we ordered - the spring rolls, tuna tataki (thick pieces of tuna!), Thai street pork, short rib ramen, and the Thai crepe dessert with vanilla ice cream and fresh mango. Well priced for great quality food. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I loveeeeee this place. I had the salmon curry it was delicious. The atmosphere is nice and although it's at the end of NoDa it's still walkable for the Community. It is right by my office and I plan to frequent often."}
{"text":"Holy Moly, this place!!! Love the food, environment, and most importantly the service. The food is the best I've had in a long time and so on point. I've informed all my friends and family about Deejai, they are in the know.   Great people and service, really going beyond the call of duty to provide a great experience. In fact I think I'm going back as I type this!   Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Love this place reminds me of home, Oahu, Hawaii. Love the atmosphere. I think it could be better in service. But all in all the food was delicious and will be back !"}
{"text":"This was by far the best Thai food I have had in the Carolinas. Really nice addition to Noda where more vegan options are needed."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Thai food in Charlotte! We honeymooned in Thailand is this is the closest we have found to being back!  The service was great, and the restaurant had a cool vibe!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. Definitely will be back very soon. For starters the spicy thai pork belly tacos are delicious. Our server Lisa was so friendly and helpful, she suggested  the lemongrass pork and it was amazing. The pork was cooked perfectly and it comes with a bowl of this awesome sauce from the gods lol. And of course we also ordered the chicken pad thai which was stellar. The ambiance of this restaurant is so inviting and cozy. I see a girls night out here very soon, we heard their sake is yummy can't wait to try them all. 5 stars definitely well deserved"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try this place out and we were extremely pleased! Everything from the appetizer, drinks, to the main course was delicious. We also received great service!"}
{"text":"This is a really great Asian fusion. Deejai has to be number 3 in Asian fusions in Charlotte. After Banh Mi brothers and Seoul meat Company. I had the honey honey roll. and the tofu pad Thai. It was really good. The service was great but the space was tight and impersonal. The food, from what I could tell was really good. The kitchen is open so you see what is going on. I'm sorry. I don't know what this place is missing but it's something. The food was good but it seemed like it was a little bit impersonal. They don't have full booths and no matter where you sit you are facing or almost in the walkway. It seemed like it wasn't small but it was poorly spaced out. That is really what my main beef was with the place. It shouldn't stop anybody from going here. The food is good. That's what matters. The dimmed lights also make it feel cramped. I have dragged on a little but it isn't a date night place. It is the type of place you go to when you have a list of places you want to go to in one night. Overall. Great place but doesn't feel like a sit down meal"}
{"text":"We went to Deejai around 5:30 PM on a Sunday. We ordered the Edamame and Spicy Thai Basil Rice Bowl (level 3) to spilt. The edamame was cooked to perfection and salted which I so appreciate and the chicken was delicious! It was quite spicy so I'll probably order a level 2 next time but I was not disappointed in the level 3 at all. The place is cute and felt very clean. My one complaint was how long it took us to get the food. There were 2 or 3 other people there before we ordered and it still took our order more than30 minutes to get to us. We finally had to ask for it. We also had to ask for the check twice. We really wanted to order dessert, but didn't feel we had the time as we had somewhere we needed to be.  So I definitely recommend this place for the food, but don't recommend it if you have somewhere you need to be in less than an hour."}
{"text":"Let me preface my review...I'm tough on Thai restaurants, more than any other cuisine! I was born in Bangkok and graduated high school there. I know good authentic Thai food and am usually disappointed in the dumbed down \"farang\" (foreigner) versions dished out most.  IWas very excited to see Deejai open another location. The Noda/Plaza Midwood areas have sorely needed a Thai restaurant.  Deejai Noda does a really nice job.  They haven't had their grand opening so the menu was still limited. My girlfriend and I have sampled Deejai 2 times in the last week, dine in and cary out.  Dine in appetizer was the fried won tons, tasty but slightly over done..but not a miss, the green papaya salad was just ok...too many noodles, not enough green papaya and very mild heat....needs work IMO.  We shared the Nam Prik as a main dish and it was very good. We ordered the springs rols and Nam Prik again for take out and it was even better.   Check it out"}
{"text":"Ordered the Nam Prik Chicken and got shrimp instead. After a long wait for the unresponsive staff to get my order right the food was terrible."}
{"text":"NoDa needed a sushi restaurant so badly and thank goodness Deejai NoDa opened up. The staff is so friendly, they have a great beer selection and the sushi taste s o o fresh! I also like they have a really diverse menu with a lot of offerings.  Thank you for getting lunch specials! I love the buy 1 get 1 half off on Tuesday"}
{"text":"This Thai restaurant was awesome! Everything was so fresh, and so tasty. We tried the dumplings -- steamed, the Honey Honey Sushi roll (seriously, an AMAZING tasting roll,) the Drunken Noodles and the Pad See You. Both were extremely flavorful and perfect for a cold January night. I ordered a 2 spiciness and it was a bit too warm for me, so next time, I would probably get a zero or 1... I didn't think I was that sensitive to heat, but it was delicious nonetheless."}
{"text":", B bService excellent.  Food (Pad Tai) excellent.  Great outdoor patio.  My wife loved her pork dish.  Well worth the drive for us coming from Ballantyne.  May take the trolley on next visit."}
{"text":"This place is tucked away beside Crown Station and it was a great find!  We had the Thai Sausage and Spring Rolls for appetizers.  Both were really good.  The Thai sausage was a little bit charred which was just the way we like it.  Spring rolls came out nice and hot.  My main dish was the Ramen Slow-Cooked Short Ribs and it was perfect for a cold night!  The broth was a little thicker than the usual broth which I really liked, and the noodles themselves were great!  The ribs were nice and tender and pretty lean too.  My boyfriend had the Pad See Ew which didn't disappoint and is always a classic favorite.  And last but not least, the crepe dessert was delicious!  They ran out of bananas and used mangos instead and I'm so glad they did!  The crepe itself was crispy and flaky, the perfect texture and flavor.  We'll definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"We had a Groupon for this restaurant that was about to expire so we decided to go on the earlier side to avoid crowds. At first it was hard to find a restaurant since it's in such an industrial part of no die and parking in the front of the restaurant is definitely tight. Easier parking is found in the lot behind the restaurant. There are some tables for outdoor seating, but we decided to sit inside because it was quite warm. The restaurants interior has an easy urban elegance to it and we were seated at a table along the wall. Although the restaurant wasn't very busy on a Saturday at 4:30, I did have to signal the waitress a couple times and we needed something. Everyone that works there seemed very nice.  We started out with some Edamame which was free since I posted a check in for the restaurant. Then we had some fried wonton dumpling Which were hot and delicious, served with a sweet and spicy chili oil sauce. For entrées I had the roast duck with noodles and I had it with broth which was delicious. My vegetarian daughter had the pad Thai with tofu and said it was great. My youngest daughter had the Short rib Ramen and my husband had the lemongrass pork which both were yummy as well! We took leftovers with us but had to have dessert of course. We shared the sweet rice pudding with mango and the moji green tea ice cream which capped off a delightful dinner! We will definitely be back for another memorable meal in the near future"}
{"text":"I've come a couple times before, but tonight the service was terrible. Took several minutes to get a server at our table to take our drink/food order. I ordered a small Tom yum soup that took far too long to arrive, and was lukewarm (flavor was fine, but nothing special). The sushi roll (honey honey roll) I ordered sat at the counter for a good 30 minutes or so. When we finally got our food, the sushi was missing avocado (an ingredient listed on the menu) - sent it back for avocado, and received no apology, no offer to remake,  and they put a few slices on the side. Will not be returning!"}
{"text":"We found hair in our food. Very disgusted. Will be going back and will post and update on the out come.    UPDATE:  We spoke to the manager and showed him the issue about our food. He did give us a full refund with a fresh order of the same thing we ordered (Veggie lovers). He was very good and understanding, however, the presentation of the food from the first time was completely unacceptable and being that we were out of towners the first impression is everything. I will change my star rating from a 1 star to s 3 star with the manager fixing the issue, but i assure you we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Drunken noodles are killer. They are level three hot, not good enough. I get them level four and they bring some heat. They are very tasty and they can accommodate me and make them vegan. The tofu is awesome in the bowl. I just had a Girl Scout cookie beer last night and it was great. Should have got it for dessert but I downed it well before my noodles came out. Parking is tight so be aware."}
{"text":"INCREDIBLE service! Lisa was incredible! Kyam was really cool and helpful too! Very personable and helpful staff, and fresh and delicious food! Five stars, all day long!"}
{"text":"Excellent Thai place located next to Crown Station in Noda. I'm a big fan of Thai food, and for those of you who are not, you are most certainly missing out. Like many Thai places, this one has a scale ranging from 1-5 in which you can select your level of spice you want on your food. I decided on a 3 which proved to be a bit too mild for me, but i tend to really like spicy food.   I chose the Chicken Pad Thai, (a classic American choice I know), but I wanted to play it safe with a new restaurant choice. I cannot comment much on the inside of the restaurant other than it was well lit and appeared to have modern seating. There was also outdoor seating available.   I was hanging out at Crown Station next door and the hostess said she would be more than happy to bring my food over. It was a healthy portion and not lacking in flavor by any means. If you like Thai, or if you're looking to broaden your taste buds check out Deejai!"}
{"text":"This place was a lunch find on the run through Noda, Charlotte . Great menu and the taste was excellent.  The atmosphere is good although quiet at lunch time.  Once the light rail gets here that maybe a different story.  I had the boat noodles and really enjoyed them. Great place and will get better."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this restaurant.  Great food and plenty of great sushi, bowls, and appetizers to choose from.  They only had a few local brews on tap, but the mixed drinks looked great."}
{"text":"People absolutely love this place and I heard the greatest things ever about it prior to going. The food is very authentic and if you're into the real deal Asian experience, this place has got ya covered. If I'm being honest though, my husband and I didn't really care for our meals. I got the boat noodles because I was afraid of most of the other dishes and he got the ramen because he said it was the only 'lo mien' noodle he could find on the menu. We were told to get the dumplings as an app, but they were out of them when we got there so we skipped on getting anything in hopes that the meal would blow us away. We tried each other's dishes and my opinion of the ramen is that it has a strong egg flavor. Granted, there are eggs in the soup and the noodles have egg in them I'm sure, but the flavor was pretty overpowering. As for my boat noodles, I'm not sure if it was the sauce they gave me to put on top, but the dish had an overwhelming smell and flavor of lemongrass. I may be a little off about the exact flavor but it made the dish almost inedible. The thing is that some people might really love these unique flavors, but they just weren't for us. You won't find typical Americanized Asian dishes on this menu. That means leave your picky friends and kids at home because they're not going to enjoy this place like someone that likes authentic Asian food. Give me some sweet and sour chicken and a boat of rice and I'm a happy camper, but this is much deeper and more unique than that so it just comes down to this:  If you're a foodie and you love authentic and wild dishes, you'll like this place. If you're picky like me and the only vegetable you eat is fries, then I would suggest a place like Gimbu 01 or Hasaki."}
{"text":"Loved our meal here last weekend! The pad Thai was some of the best I've had in Charlotte and their pho was also really amazing and rich! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Wow, stumbled across this place on accident while poking around NoDa with my son. Brings me back to the excellent spicy Thai noodles I used to have in NYC - great prices , great service, great food.... Can't recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"Update: came back the following weekend and with my sister we tried new dishes and were not disappointed! The kao piek sen is just like my moms, absolutely comforting. The Salmon curry noodles were delicious in a generous portion! And the boat noodles had such a great beefy flavor to them! We also tried the dynamite roll which my husband loved and the spicy tuna poke bowl which was amazing. I'm excited to try more menu items and we can't wait to tell all of our friends about this awesome new spot!"}
{"text":"I was slightly upset with my experience here. I was staying across the street, so when I googled the menu and phone number to order (allowing google to use my location) I assumed I was ordering from the right place. When I arrived I learned that I had ordered from the one on providence road. So word to the wise either look up the street address, ask on the phone or google Deejai Noddle Bar. The two restaurants have slightly different menus so I had to reorder my food.       I wasn't upset with the staff working, it's not their fault I ordered from the wrong place but over all they need to be more clear on the phone or website to avoid this problem in the future.        I ordered the drunken noodles. You can order on a scale from 0-5 spiciness. I ordered a 1 and it still had a little kick. I was very excited to try the pineapple in the dish, but I did not see any nor taste any pineapple. However if you are a basil fan it is very prevalent and tasty. Overall I wasn't thrilled with my meal. It was very veggie/ chicken heavy and light on the noodles."}
{"text":"Best first time experience!! The food is so delicious! I got the shrimp and chicken pad Thai and to say it tasted great is an understatement. The flavors, the customer service, and the convenient location! To top my meal off, I got the mango dessert. But they didn't have anymore mango so they gave me pineapples instead. I honestly think the pineapples were a better touch than the mangos."}
{"text":"This place is easily going to be my new favorite. Wait staff was helpful, food was amazing, and there are fun places to hang out after dinner (Crown Station and Bold Missy). Sushi rolls aren't on the menu but the sushi chefs  are so great they'll make you whatever you want! Pad Thai is great here but if you want something with a little kick, order the basil chicken."}
{"text":"Deejai Noda was a pleasant find for us! Right when we approached the door, the staff greeted us with a friendly smile. Although it was a Friday night we were immediately seated. We Were given prompt attention. The young lady (I think her name is Lotty) was very nice and friendly and quite on top of things. We had our drinks promptly. On this particular night they had Tequila Sunrises on sale. It literally was the best Tequila Sunrise that I had ever drank! For the meal I had the Seafood Poke. This was soooo good. Fresh ingredients were certainly used. You could just taste the freshness with each bite. It had eel skin, shrimp, small softshell crab, tuna, salmon. It was sooo good. We also got the Honey Roll. Some of the best sushi ever! This place is great. I will be back to try other options. Good drink, Good food, and Great service...Why not!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere they created and it's very hip vibe for Asian food. The decor, location and food is on point! I would say dine in is always better than carry out."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and service was great. Can't wait to come back!  We got the spring rolls, fried rice and wings. The sushi menu also looked great so that will be on my list for next time. Also, they have crushed ice. It's the best."}
{"text":"Good service, Lisa was very helpful at explaining menu items.  Drunken noodles were the best thing any of us had.  Green curry with chicken was also good. Pork and rice was a big disappointment.   No Tom Kha soup, at this location was a even bigger disappointment!   Probably won't be back, will stick with the original location.  Oh... parking in the front is horrible.  Can't believe the City allows this.  More parking in back that we weren't aware of."}
{"text":"Excellent little Thai place in Noda. Very sleek and new inside, although it gets tight when busy with the narrow floor plan. Service is always ver friendly but can be spotty  as far as checking back, or servers handing you off - especially on busy nights. The drink menu is fun and everything we've tried we've enjoyed. The food is excellent. Great sushi, really yummy noodle dishes - my favorite is the Pad See Ew (which isn't listed on the menu online but I always get in the restaurant), and incredible Thai wings!"}
{"text":"Totally surprised.Surpassed my expectations. I loved everything we ordered. Great flavors and sauces. I'll be back"}
{"text":"One of the best thai restaurants that I have had the pleasure of dining at. The service, food, and location were impeccably decadent without any flaws. Thank you for a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"I dont even know where to start. I would give this place 10 stars if I could. The wings are to DIE for (comes with a delicious dipping sauce). Peach Tea Saketini is a must try, its refreshing and gets the job done. My server Hau was nothing short of amazing. He took his time explaining the menu to me and even had great recommendations. Cant wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Th food was excellent, but their beer selection absolutely sucked. They only have three beer choices and all of them were unbelievably bitter. If you are going  stop by for the food and a glass of water, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Some of the best tofu I've ever had. The nam prik was so extraordinary that I wanted to use a straw to drink the sauce. I cant wait to come back."}
{"text":"Great customer service and first time experience !! I would totally make another visit soon. The Three Amigo poke bowl is beautiful and a colorful presentation. The Shrimp pad Thai is traditional with a hint of sweetness !"}
{"text":"I loved the atmosphere of the restaurant -- the vibe there was great!  I ordered the pad Thai, spring rolls, and a bubble tea.  The spring rolls were great!  The pad Thai was good, but I have to say I'm a bit spoiled -- after you've been to Thailand, nothing else quite measures up, haha.  The bubble tea was good too!  It was much less sweet than I was expecting, but to be honest, I actually liked the difference!  Maybe next time I'll test out something else to see what will be my \"go to\" item here...I just wish they had more sushi options that *don't* contain raw fish :\"}
{"text":"Went to Deejai last night for a sushi snack.   We ordered the Sushi special for the night, the NoDa Roll & the Honey Honey roll. They were both awesome. I have to say the sushi is probably the best I have had in Charlotte, fresh and full of flavor. They told me that there is sushi on lunch special M-F....now, if I can only find more time for my lunch hour."}
{"text":"It's not often I sit down and look at a menu and there are soooo many choices I want to try that it's hard to make up my mind. Deejay NoDa has such a menu. Such great dishes!  Everything my wife and I chose was beautifully presented and cooked to perfection. Stellar service and a real nice space made this a memorable meal."}
{"text":"I had to try it!! Of course I do, it's hot and new!  I went on a Sunday for brunch and it was slow at first and then got busy as the day went on.  The server was really out of it.  She was completely confused and the whole greeting/ordering was not ideal.  Really no conversation, not asking if we'd been before, no explaining of the menu or specials.  That was disappointing.   The appetizers: (edamame & spring rolls) and sushi (honey) were good. The spring rolls had a great peanut dipping sauce.  The drunken noodles, I ordered a special way, omitting some items and the waitress literally came back three times to ask me what the order was again. After writing it down the first time.  Well, third times a charm, because it came out tasty!  I got 4 spicy, but could've done 5.   Mango sticky rice was delicious.  Food was very good. Environment was nice...beautiful inside and a patio outside.  Service, not what I would've expected.  Maybe a bad day."}
{"text":"Ahhh! Love the pad Thai, wings and dumplings! I tried their sampler platter during Divine Barrel brewery's opening and they gave me so much food on one plate. I will definitely be going back soon!"}
{"text":"First time at the restaurant and definitely will be back! Ordered the honey honey roll, pad Thai with chicken, and the crunch shrimp roll. Honey honey was amazing! Pad Thai was beautifully presented. The interior was very modern. Great date night!"}
{"text":"Okay,  I'm a writing this as I'm hangrily waiting at their hosts table with no one even looking at us. I've been in this same situation twice before and I keep coming back just because their food is decent .They just have two waiters running back and forth and also hosting at the same time. Either hire more ppl or train your wait staff. Either ways do something and fix this place    Edit: I've had dinner now. Life's much better"}
{"text":"I was starving so i didnt get a chance to take a picture of the Tom Yum soup. It was a large portion. Like i said i was starving like a mofo and i ate the whole thing. We also got some dumplings. They were good  I had to order more food so i got the mango sticky rice and spring rolls just being a fat ass"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch.  Service was mediocre as the server didnt seem to know what was going on. Food was not bad but if I wasnt in the area I honestly wouldn't drive to just come get this. Limited vegetarian options."}
{"text":"We've been waiting some time for Deejai to open in NoDa. We're fortunate to have them just 100yds or so from our house and now after a month of regular take-outs are ecstatic to report that every experience has been stellar with high quality dishes and a friendly staff.   We're so happy to have you in the neighborhood and are looking forward to introducing our toddler to every dish on the menu until she loves thai food aa much as mom and dad :-)"}
{"text":"Yummy yum  started with the Thai chicken wings and had the chicken pad Thai for dinner! Both were spicy and AMAZING!  Next time I will ask how spicy are the freshly ground  peppers cause them babies had that dish SPICY! Finished with a iced hibiscus  sweet tea! Will definitely be back for lunch!"}
{"text":"Played hookie today from work with the boo and looking for something close to home in NODA and once again Yelp to the rescue.   What a freaking gem for a noodle fanatic like me and so close to home. This is definitely my new favorite spot. Our waitress was very personable, friendly, attentive and actually seemed to love what she does. The initial walk-in I started to question the level of service bc the guy who I later found out was the bar back took us to the table without saying one word. Not a hello, hru, are you a zombie or do you prefer brains with your noodles. I would recommend everyone being personable with customers you never know if their a Yelper, Health inspector, yadda yadda yadda.   Thank you to our wonderful waitress for setting a high standard of service. As for the food, it was literally finger licking, lip sucking good! Having moved from NYC, I tasted some authentic Asian and Asian Fusion noodles dishes and I must say this met my expectations. My hat off to the kitchen/chef.  If you're into noodles, check out this gem! You won't be disappointed!  Ramen Short Rib Pad See Wey Mimosa Proseco"}
{"text":"This is a great new Thai spot that will soon be right off of the light rail. The food was quite good and there was a huge menu with a lot of variety on it. There were noodle dishes, poke bowls, Curry, and more. I got one of the noodle dishes and it was great. The papaya salad was also very good. My husband loved his poke bowl. My favorite thing was the mango rice pudding that I got for dessert. We went for an early dinner on a weeknight and it was empty  I would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"I had to check out the place after a few people mentioned that Deejai had a new location. Although to be fair, I'm not sure if this noodle bar is in any way affiliated with Deejai Thai here in Charlotte. Either way, I was pleasantly surprised to see that they were not located on the main strip in NoDa (parking can be hell).   Despite not being on the main strip, the parking was still atrocious. I actually ended up pulling out a parking lot entrance that lead to a dead-end because the parking lot was too tight with huge SUV's blocking people in. Sorry, it isn't 2003, didn't those go out of style when gas sky-rocketed to $5 in the late 2000's?  The staff here were extremely sweet and friendly. They are definitely out to please and welcome guests as if it were their home. Originally ordered the pad thai which came out way too sweet. They use a premade sauce and to be honest having had pad thai around the world including multiple trips to Thailand, it was some of the worst I have ever had. Period.   The staff very graciously allowed me to change my order to a basil noodle which came out way better. Still a tad bit on the sweet side and a bit 'wet', but I'm sure for most American palates it would be considered 'a-ok'.   So long story short don't come here expecting traditionally prepared dishes that will standup to your experiences traveling. However, if you are craving americanized asian noodles this place will hit the spot. I will definitely be going back to try out the poke almost 100% because of the amazing service."}
{"text":"Deejai NoDa is still in it's infancy, not even had a grand opening yet, but is already producing stellar dishes in a pretty cool space.   I'll get the less-than-positive over with, and both gripes aren't with the restaurant itself. The first is the location by the train. It's going to get loud and congested, especially when the train goes by. That will back traffic up, they need to finish up construction there to have an easy out - it doesn't exist right now. The second is the parking lot, or really lack thereof. For both Crown Central and Deejai, there are less than 15 parking spots. That ain't gonna cut it in a month. Maybe there's a lot that I didn't see, but it should be worked on.  Okay, on to the positivity :)  Deejai NoDa has a lounge type feel, with a gorgeous bar, light wooden tables, modern light fixtures, and fun music playing in the background. We were seated and greeted immediately (the place had maybe only 5 parties being served, but I'm still grateful for attentive service). First glance, huge menu! Really impressive the amount of cool dishes they have. They also have a separate sushi menu, dessert, and a saki-based cocktail menu (all on my list to try). Our waiter was kind and gave his recommendations. Against my better judgement, we skipped appetizers, but went straight for the entrees: I ordered the Spicy Basil Chicken (default spice level 3) and The Lady ordered the Pad Thai (spice level 2). They came out and the presentation was gorgeous, hers more than mine, adorned with a flower and fresh ingredients with bright colors. The aroma coming from mine was incredible. It comes with ground chicken, red peppers, green beans, a side bowl of white rice, basil, and the broth/juices. For such a simple dish, the flavors were phenomenal, and the spice level was just right. AND it was basically 2 portions, the other is sitting, crying for me right now in the fridge. Don't worry buddy, I'll take care of you soon. Our waiter also brought me a sample of their house-made hot sauce, which was like a citrusy sambal paste. When the check came, we got mints, which is an acceptable alternative to fortune cookies. I love mints.  For the price, quantity and quality of food, service, and variety of menu items, Deejai earns a well-deserved spot on my 5 star list. I can't wait to see what they do come grand opening time.   Side note: The coffee shop/bar next door looks SO cool! And you can bring over your food from Deejai to sit and eat while looking out the bay doors on Bold Missy, or the lightrail construction? If that floats your boat..."}
{"text":"I been here couple times before for lunch and dinner. Lunch today wasn't great we felt rushed and we weren't the only one that was there. The noodles to the boat noodles was hard I wish they would use a better quality noodles a fresh one would be nice. My pork skin was already in the soup and so was the basil. What if I would to be allergic to Basil? Just a side note. I understand that is an hour before closing but if there was others was still there when we left is a shitty customer service."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good but the service was incredibly slow. We made a reservation for two for 5:30 on Sunday and was asked if we had a Groupon, which we did. When we arrived at 5:15pm, there was hardly anyone there so we were seated immediately. We ordered the papaya noodle salad appetizer from one waitress and then our entrees from another. The appetizer arrived in about 10 minutes after we ordered. As we were eating, we discovered that there was a piece of hair on the bottom of an egg. Then, we waited for an hour for the entrees to be served. I asked the second waitress if it usually takes this long for the food to be cooked. She told me that unfortunately, it does because they go in the order our tickets are placed in the line. This didn't make sense to us because we had previously come to the restaurant two weeks ago on a very busy Friday night. Our food was served in half the time. I am very torn to come back or not because of the second experience."}
{"text":"This place just popped up off of Craighead Dr., and I had to check it out. Came here for a birthday lunch and wow... I started by sitting outside, but the sun kept pounding us so we came inside. Such nice decor.  I ordered a Strawberry Blossom drink. To be honest, I forgot what was in it, but obvioiusly strawberry juice, and some kind of sake. Oh!! There was rum in there. AH-MAZING. For my food, I ordered the Ba Mi Ped w/ Broth. They have a version of this that is dry, but I couldn't imagine the dish dry. The broth set it over the top. I'll definitely order again.  If there is one con.. I would say it's the service. Waitress was very attentive but it took a while to try to track someone down for me to get to-go containers and some other things. That is not going to stop me from going again because the food was fantastic. Forget that I even mentioned that con.  Just bring yourself here with a nice group of friends. The ambiance is fabulous, the drinks were fabulous, the food was fabulous, and you will be too once you leave. Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Great noodles! Drunken noodles were perfect, texture and taste both were fantastic. Our server was very attentive and cute as a button. we had the unfortunate luck of getting in a fender bender while leaving the lot but we can't blame that on the place. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times.  Each time I've visited the wait staff was responsive and polite.  The food is always excellent and the prices are not outrageous. I like to order a different item each time I visit.  Once I ordered something that was a bit too spicy for my delicate digestive system and it was replaced.  I appreciated that type of customer service (which seems to be lost in most establishments nowadays).  This place is on my regular rotation now for take-out and casual dining!"}
{"text":"Popped in with a $40 for $22 Groupon and had a great experience. We barely had a wait on a Friday night, and the waitress was super helpful as we asked questions about what to get. I had a California roll and the chicken pad Thai. The California roll was pretty standard, but the pad Thai was great. It was a hearty serving with lots of chicken. I asked for it mild, and the spice level was perfect. Awesome experience, especially with the Groupon!"}
{"text":"This place is a perfect addition to Noda! I'm so happy this place opened up. The Pad Thai is delish, Nam Prik (Curry) is my go to, and the Chicken Fried Rice was so tasty. For dessert, we tried the sticky rice with mangos and ice cream! It was so good and we split it between three people. The service is always so good and the atmosphere is awesome! I can't wait for warm weather to enjoy their patio."}
