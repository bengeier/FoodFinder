{"text":"We had to go home after 1 hour and a half. And we never got served. Three tables arrived after us and got served and we were just 2 people. Cannot say if the food is good or not, but the salad they served when we arrived as an appetizer had sand on it. Never taking chances at this place again."}
{"text":"The meat and fish were really great and the atmosphere was totally wacky in the best sense. You're basically dining in an antique shop which is fun and not the dusty mess of my nightmares.  This place is located in a modernish strip mall in the gay village so the inside is like a portal to another more delicious dimension. We had the grilled sardines and grilled calamari appetizers, which were excellent. The choice of 5 meats dish was an awesome deal and the best variety in town.  Piri piri is homemade and spicy deliciousness. Service was very nice. Problems: they only serve fries as a side dish. I don't eat fries, so I left hungry. There was a salad to begin with but it wasn't enough to supplement a side. Really wish they had a grilled veggie side option or appetizer or something.  This is a constant problem in Montreal in general so I can't fault this restaurant in particular, but they do have a healthy menu so it doesn't make any sense that they wouldn't have veggies as an optional side dish.  Sauce is served in mugs with basting brushes sitting in it which is seriously gross considering how many people have touched it/ breathed on it/ slathered already chewed bits of meat with it. Also the music was just awful, full of ads and kept fading in and out, didn't fit the atmosphere and it was dreadful light electronic house music. Not suggesting that the music should be all Portuguese or light jazz or anything, just something less terrible than what was playing.  It really ruined the experience."}
{"text":"Secret surprise!!!! Wow... felt like I was in another city! The decor is.... just amusing!! Generous portion salads and bread! Food presentation is nice as well. The lamp chop I had was just ok, but the grilled chicken was delicious!! Will come back for the chicken for sure!! Friendly owner! You can tell the owner put a lot of thoughts behind this restaurant. It's a bit hidden and the outside window doesn't do this place the justice. Highly recommend to give this place a try! It's a bit a romantic spot since not a lot of people know about this place!"}
