{"text":"Wow...  It's my first time to have a cup of TWO flavors bubble tea!! Yes,  I mean it,  the only bubble tea shop I've ever seen in Toronto have two flavors in one cup!  It fully satisfied my crave for mango and passion fruit. The topping was not the ordinary tapioca but a lychee flavor boba (a juice burst thing tapioca).   
It's easy to find the store,  you'll see a big teddy  on display!"}
{"text":"Pop Up House is great for inexpensive snacks. I had the fresh mango slush with tapioca and found that there was way too much ice in the drink and couldn't really taste the fresh mangoes. I also got the bubble waffle and enjoyed that much more."}
{"text":"You can't get a better deal anywhere else! The food and drinks are fantastic and the service is very nice. Definitely will be back :)"}
{"text":"The place is awesome! It's like a hidden gem upstairs that not many will discover. They have a lot of different options for desserts or snacks or drinks. 

I went there for the bubble tea and got their cup that has two sides for two different flavours. They were good but not the best. However I got caught on the fact they had close to 20 different flavours of ice cream and it was all under $3! I decided to get their 3 scoops of ice cream (you can get all different flavours) for $2.30! The ice cream was awesome! I tried their taro, coconut, and pistachio. The taro is not your normal flavoured version, I suspect it's real ingredients (don't quote me on that, nevertheless it tastes really good), that you wouldn't kind of expect from such a small shop. The pistachio and coconut both had real pieces in it as well!

It's a fun place to venture to and you have a mini pmall to walk around while you enjoy your food."}
{"text":"Very cheap and pretty tasty! Went here yesterday after hearing about the cheap prices and I couldn't be more impressed! The food and drinks here are SUPER CHEAP. The egg waffles are only $1 with any drink purchase! They also have many combos all under $4! I tried the fresh mango drink with popping yogurt and it was delicious! The egg waffles were made fresh when ordered and were perfectly sweetened. 

When I went back to pick up my order, the owner introduced me to their combos and I just couldn't resist trying! I tried the chicken crepe with mayo, dried pork puff, and terriyaki sauce and it also came with a bubble tea. The combo was only $3 + tax!!!!!

Only downside is that the service was a little slow. Waited around 20 mins for everything. Only the owner there making all the orders."}
{"text":"Prices are amazing, but the taste is not the best. It also takes quite some time for the bubble tea to be made. I was told to come back 10 mins later, but I waited about 30 mins before I was able to receive my order,"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I initially came to this mall for airsoft gear and we stumbled upon this cute little shop. We were amazed with how great the prices were and decided to give it a try. This was our first time here, so the gentleman (possibly the owner) showed us our food and drink options and answered any questions we had. He was extremely polite and patient, which we really appreciated. I ordered the Oreo ice cream with the waffle and my boyfriend got the honeydew green tea with lychee jelly and a bubble waffle as well. They had a promotion going on so we took full advantage of that. In total we spent $6, which I think is an amazing deal considering most bubble tea options at other stores are $6 just for the drink alone. Once we got our food and drinks, we were extremely happy with the overall taste of our food. We had such an amazing experience and if we are ever in the area again, we would definitely come back and try their other options. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Prices: Cheap cheap!  If you get this reference, you are reading the review in 2017 lols.  There is this really annoying radio commercial and I just remember birds chirping cheap cheap.  When I think of affordable BBT, I think of Pop Up House.  You really CANNOT beat these prices.  Just like what everyone else said, you are paying almost nothing to try 2 flavours of BBT.

Taste: Average at best.  Not going to lie, it's a genius idea but the taste is mediocre...There are lots of flavours and the staff member will do everything in front of you lols.  

Service: The reason I gave this place a 4 star is because I feel they could improve.  Not only can everything be more efficient (because damn it took 20 minutes to make 2 drinks), but I know there's a potential.  It's literally a pop-up store, they aren't here to make a fortune, it seems like they (I only saw 1 staff honestly) really enjoy the taste of BBT."}
{"text":"we came here because we heard that if u bought a bubble tea u could get a free waffle which is a very good deal and i got both for $2.75
i got the vanilla milk tea and i rate it 4/10 i got less sugar but it tasted like he put extra sugar. tapioca is also yummy 
my friends got the thai milk tea and they said they didn't like it and rate it 2/5 
the owner was very nice and friendly :-)"}
{"text":"One of the many establishments within Langham Square, but definitely one of the best for dessert. I found the bubble tea to be slightly lacking, where the syrup was not completely mixed in, and the texture of the tapioca was quite poor. However, it was definitely compensated in their egg waffles! For just $3, you can get an egg waffle with a scoop of ice cream; I would recommend a plain egg waffle with green tea or taro ice cream. The egg waffle comes topped with pretzels and other toppings. Overall, much better value than other similar establishments in the area (e.g. Woofles and Cream, Toast Delight etc), with amazing egg waffles that are crunchy, and just the right amount of sweet!"}
{"text":"I like the 2-flavours cup for bubble tea.  It is cute.  And I tried the HK style eggo but it is not as good as the one at pacific mall/market village.  The owner is friendly but service is EXTREMELY SLOW.  I ordered a bubble tea, eggo and eggo with ice-cream and it took almost 30 mins.  OMG.  Price is good.  Also, I am concern about the cleanliness of the place since it is so small and their 'kitchen' seems a little messy."}
{"text":"This is a great place. A mom and pop shop that's pretty small but still good. Wait is very very very long but worth it when it's great food at a great cost. Many menu options, almost too much but the resin i got back is the prices. This place is way cheaper than any other i've been too. Even though the wait is extremely long and the food is pretty good it's still makes me come back again and again."}
{"text":"I've been coming here practically everyday, all their stuff is so well priced and yummy! I've had basically their whole menu and nothing's too salty or sweet. For their bubble tea you can also adjust sugar levels and the employees are so nice there"}
{"text":"Super cheap eats here at Pop Up House.  We got a banana crepe with chocolate and whipped cream along with a milk bubble tea for only $2.99! Honestly I'm so shocked that they can keep prices this low!!! The owner was super nice and friendly and it was only a 5 minute wait for the set.  

The chocolate on the crepe wasn't your standard nutella, but it tasted like actual chocolate.  The crepe itself was just ok though, but definitely worth the money.  

There are many other items on the menu well worth trying!"}
{"text":"The location is very hidden, on the second floor inside the mall on top of t&t supermarket, but also hidden to the side and somewhere along the row. Go up the escalators, go all the way left and then turn right. 

Tried the Taiwanese mini crepe, the flavour was very good! The crepe could be be a bit more crispy, The combo came with original milk tea, it has more tea flavour if you get it less sweet, this is all up to personal taste. 

Also had the deep fried fish balls, $1.50 which is great, there was 5pcs of different varieties, wish it came with a choice of sauce such as curry, sweet&spicy, etc instead of just soy sauce (but still better than no sauce)

The HK styles waffle was delicious! Soft and sweet, has peanut butter and sugar inside. Upgraded my drink to avocado slush (add $2.50) drink was fresh, and food was freshly made! Worth the wait! 

It's a great place to grab a quick snack! 

Will come back again and try the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Mini shop located upstairs in Langham Square and opened later at night for those who wants an affordable dessert. 

Outside the shop, we saw tons of signs with the different food snacks that were sold at this shop. Egg waffles are on the affordable side - $2 for plain waffles, generally $2.50 to $3 for special waffles (e.g. ginger waffles, chocolate chip waffles, green tea waffles, etc.) They also had options for waffles with ice cream.

Pop Up House also sells tons of random products including old toys, notebooks, utensils (there were some forks here), and other mysterious items. They also have some ketchup, mustard, and relish on the shelves for people to use. There are two seats and a small table for a small amount of people to sit on.

The packaging of these snacks reminds me of some of those in HK. The bags and cups are generic cups and bags with premade designs on it. A VERY small green sticker with pop up house is stuck onto the packaging.

We got the green tea egg waffles $3. We were asked to wait 5-10 minutes, I think this place is for small business, if more people show up, I'm not sure if they would be ready. The egg waffle itself wasn't too good (in comparison to Tung Tung ones). I thought the green tea was actually slightly bitter. The egg waffles were cooked nicely though."}
{"text":"On my recent experience I came it's 4 friends. I wanted to try Thai milk tea because I heard it was good. the guy was very nice when we ordered 

Three of us got Thai milk tea and my other friend got the vanilla milk tea. we thought they all came with promotion of free bubble waffle because it says buy a milk tea get a bubble waffle for free  but turns out it is only for the milk teas in the pink sheets.

Anyways the milk tea was $3.29 for regular and 4.29 for large. We went walking around them came back 15 min later and they were ready. I never tried Thai milk tea but my friends have and they said it was really good. However upon trying it wasn't exactly how they imagined. They said they gave it around a 4/10 and I would say it is a 5/10 considering it just take like chinese milk tea from restaurants 
Also it stains your teeth and makes it orange but you can wipe it off 

My friend got the vanilla milk tea and it was pretty sweet even with less sugar and I would give it 3/5 
The bubble waffle was still good and it was a very good price considering she got a free edible waffle

Overall I think the food is better than the drinks but I would come again."}
{"text":"Everything $5 and under. Pop Up House is on the 2nd floor of Langham Square. Unit 2109, if I recall correctly. It's a tiny, basically takeout only place. They also sell an assortment of random things. I mean really random. 

The first time I came, I got a Japanese savory mini crepe for $3.99. It was filled with cucumbers, seaweed salad, mayo, and eel. It also came with an original milk tea with 1 topping. At that price, I'd like magnificence, but I don't expect it. For the price, it was a great snack. There was a decent amount of eel in the crepe as well. I actually didn't want my milk tea at that time, so they said they'd write me out a voucher for one. My friend got the bubble waffle with sesame ice cream ($3). They topped it with two pretzels and a square of chocolate. At that price, they bothered to care about presentation. I was impressed. At that point, we'd already decided we'd come again. We just didn't quite realize how soon...

We walked around the mall and then actually returned for more food. This time, my friend got their curry fishballs ($2.50 for 5), and I got a combo with 2 pieces of takoyaki, a small serving of sweet potato fries, and 5 assorted fishballs + original milk tea (with 1 topping) for $4.50? $5? Something like that. The curry fish balls are one of their specialties. I can see why. They're filled with curry sauce and little bits of meat on the inside. They were very tasty. My fried fish balls were surprisingly good as well. The sweet potato fries were alright, but I've had better. The takoyaki was some of the better ones I've had in Toronto. These weren't dense and doughy. These were soft and delightful. They were also sitting on top of a spoonful of seaweed salad I wasn't expecting.

All in all, a fantastic find and an incredible cheap eat."}
{"text":"Eggette waffle was good. Not amazing, stayed crunchy on the outside

Coconut slush too much ice, so thick that it can flip like a blizzard

I like their ??? flavour but it wasn't amazing. The waffle was so soft I was not impressed. 

The best part for their place is the fact that their prices are so cheap!!! And the cool part is how you can get 2 drinks in 1 cup. Don't get fooled cause if you think wisely you get less beverage for the same amount in price.

I'm not sure if you can really sit in there cause when I first went in there was a shopping cart in the store. It took up half the space. When I came back the cart was gone. I'm not sure if it belonged to a customer or they did not have time to empty out their purchases but it was so crowded my friend and I did not bother going in till the other guest left."}
{"text":"I got their special set - egg waffle and one drink with free topping, for $3 only. I had original milk tea and I think it taste like Hong Kong style milk tea, which I love it. For the egg waffle, you can choose it's texture to be soft, normal, or crispy. I think the egg waffle is pretty good for its price. The size is not that big compare to other store's but it's good enough for a price of $1. The clerk is very nice and polite too. If you are looking for something cheap and good, you should try out this place! I will definitely come back here for an afternoon dessert or late night snack."}
{"text":"Located on the 2nd floor of the T and T plaza, it's off to the side a little hidden down the hallway on the left side up the escalator. It's well worth the search though, because they have amazingly cute bubble teas and egg waffles. I've only ever been here for both, but I've loved it every time. They have bubble teas with double cups, so you can put two types of drinks in a split cup. And as far I know, I've only ever seen the split cups here in Toronto and Markham. Their egg waffles are also super cheap, around $2, which is the lowest price I've seen in the area. They're done well - crispy on the outside and still airy and fluffy inside. Their other menu items look interesting and are all priced super competitively, so maybe I'll try some of them another day.

There's only one staff member there, so sometimes there can be a wait on weekends or evenings. The owner/staff is super nice though. Once, because he thought that our egg waffle was a bit soggy, he made a complementary one and gave us both to enjoy. Most other places would have just given the first one and continued on with their other customers, so I really appreciate the level of customer service that they have here."}
{"text":"I was nearby and searched bubble tea. I found out through Yelp there is a new shop and I wanted to check it out. So I purposely came go this plaza to try pop up. I was with a friend and we both ordered a bubble tea with a waffle each. 

The owner was really passionate and friendly. He was explaining the options we had, such as having two flavors in a cup, or how we can choose from a variety of toppings etc. I can tell he really wants to be nice to his customers and he puts in time to communicate with them. 

After we paid, we were told there would be a 20-30 wait for our order. We ordered two drinks and four waffles in total. Me and my friend were surprised because we never had to wait this long for HK egg waffles before. We sat outside the store, hoping it would be ready around 10minutes or so. But nope. We literally waited 25minutes for our order for drinks and waffles.

Given the wait, I think it is hard for the shop to sell a lot of items because they are not making their products as efficient as their competitors. It seems like a shop that will cater to kids as they wait for their parents to grocery shop downstairs. But I can't see a reason why customers would purposely come into this plaza to purchase egg waffles with such a long wait time. Moreover, the quality of the items were not outstanding. Because the shop is on the second floor of a small shopping center, it may be hard to attract customers who aren't already in the plaza to come purposely all the way to the shop unless it has unique or high quality offerings."}
{"text":"4 star for the food 5 star for the price. 

One word: CHEAP 

There's no other place that would offer everything on their menu for under $5 and their menu is quite extensive and overwhelming with all their flavours that they offer. 

I love the concept of duo cups 'cause they're just so convenient and you don't need to struggle between choosing which drink you want. I wanted to opt for something different (rather pay cheap to try something new rather than to pay for an expensive drink and not like it, right?). I got lychee slush (taste just like to the one from Ten Rens!) and mango yogurt juice (not the best, but it was still good). It comes when the 1 topping on ONE side only so if you wanted it for both sides, it's an additional 0.50 cents. 

They have many promos as well. Current promos including getting free milk tea (toppings are additional 0.50 cents) with the purchase of any drink OR get bubble waffles for $1 with the purchase of any drink (cannot combine promos, I think..). The split drinks are originally $3.99 but after a certain time (forgot which time but they're different for weekend and weekdays), they're only $3. Original price for bubble waffle is $2. 

Side note: my milk tea tasted watered down...

Their bubble waffles are surprisingly yummy! The bubble part was really shaped like a bubble and it was so crispy when it was fresh. If you leave it til later it gets a little hard to pull but still delicious. When I was younger, I frequently got the ones from Market Village/Pmall, but THESE ARE SO MUCH BETTER!! Love how they aren't soggy. 

The only downside is the speed. The owner is extremely nice and will strike up a conversation with you but there seems to be only one person working (taking orders and making the food) so warning! THE WAIT WILL BE LONG. Honestly, for the price I don't mind waiting around if I'm not in a hurry but if I am in a rush, then this is not the place to go lol."}
{"text":"This is a really cute store on the otherwise quiet floor of the plaza/mall. With a bunch of knick knacks and various snacks, you'll wonder how the owner managed to fit so much into such a tiny space. The egg waffles were good - the sweetness and crunchiness of the waffle are there - but not the best I've ever had. Plus, you can't beat the price.

The food itself isn't what gave it 4 stars though. It's the owner. My brother and I only had credit cards and forgot to bring cash. Not only did the owner remain jovial and friendly, he even offered to let us pay him back the next time we came by. Wow. We managed to scrounge out loose change in the car to pay him back a few moments later, but how nice of him to have offered!"}
{"text":"This sketchy POP UP shop will definitely POP you with surprises!
At first, I hesitated to go in. I was very confused if this place actually sold FOOD or random stationeries & crafts?

However, I was rather pleasantly surprised. The prices for the food items were extremely reasonably priced - $3.75 (after tax) for an egg waffle PLUS a regular slush with 1 topping. Holy smokes!!!

They were doing a special \"buy a bubble tea drink and get an egg waffle for free\". So, I decided to give that a try. The cashier was very friendly and attentive. The wait was reasonable since they were making everything fresh. 

Coconut slush with grass jelly (30% sugar) - I can taste the overall coconut flavour. Unfortunately, they put way too much ice. It was way too thick! I can literally flip the drink over and it will stay in place.

Original Egg waffle - decent egg waffle. I kind of waited too long to eat it. Even though the egg waffle was cooled down, it still had the taste an egg waffle should have. Next time, I'm going to have it when it's nice and hot!  :)

Would I come back? Yes please!!! Bring me back!!! I want to try sooooo many other things on the menu! I want to try their specialty egg waffles (orange chocolate) with ice cream (taro)!

P.S. They have very limited seating (2 tables with 4 chairs and a bench). It might be better off to order & go!"}
{"text":"3.5

While location is a bit hidden and small, it is a great find with quite a large snack selection.  Owner is super nice.

Tried their bubble waffle + double cup bbt (taro milk tea, honey dew milk tea).  I would say the bubble waffles is pretty good.  Leans towards crunchy airy side rather than chewy.  It is also not super sweet which is great!  Drinks wise it is lacking.  I think they do make it with powder rather than fruit syrup which does cause both flavour of milk tea to fall a bit short.  Taro is still good but honey dew I may not get again as it tastes slightly metalicy for some reason.

Will I go back? Definitely for a great deal of $3 double cup drink + $1 bubble waffle (after 7pm m-f, 8pm s-s).  Also i would be interested in their other snack selections too!"}
{"text":"Mediocre waffles but good for the price. The wait time is VERY long...think 30mins per waffle.
Waffle was on the dry end, don't think I'll go back."}
{"text":"The folks here are SO nice, it feels like you're right at home. Food is amazing and an unbeatable price. 

You can get a combo for $2.80 + tax for a hot dog, mashed potatoes, and HOMEMADE meatballs with milk tea (remember to leave a tip!). 

coming back here again, sooo good.

PS: check out the pop out bubble tea! That's the shops unique product"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a cheap place for bubble tea/egg waffles, look no further. They have a variety of selection for bubble tea. It's $2.99 plus tax for a small, and you get a free topping. Along with it, you get a free egg waffle. 

TASTE: (3/5)
Original bubble tea with tapioca ($2.99) 
- similar to a lot of other bubble tea places. However it is a bit watered down and the tea taste is not as strong

Egg waffle (Free with bubble tea)
- I've had some people tell me they overdo the egg waffles and that it was not soft enough. There are levels that you can choose from depending on how soft/hard you want it.
- For me, I find there's a bit of an egg-like taste to it, but it satisfies my egg waffle craving!

PRICE (5/5)


OVERALL (3.5/5) 

Overall, it does satisfy a good craving of both for a good price! A side of caution however, if you're short on time, this may not be the place to go, especially on weekends. I feel like they only have one egg waffle machine, so it can take anywhere from 15-30 minutes depending on the time/day you go visit."}
{"text":"A small little shop that sells bubble tea type drinks and Asian street snacks. The owner is a friendly man and introduced the store's offerings. A cool feature is the split double cup, allowing you to choose 2 flavors if you can't decide.
Currently, they have a buy one bubble tea get one original bubble tea special. Or, you can add $1 with any drink purchase to get an original bubble waffle.
The store also sells an assortment of candies and chips, and random miscellaneous items."}
{"text":"[LOCATION] - 3/5
This place is located on Main Street Unionville and Highway 7 in Langham Square (on the 2nd floor above T&T). Outdoor parking spaces are limited during lunch/dinner/weekends, but there are plenty of spots in the underground parking lot. Take a left at the escalator, follow the sign, and walk towards the end of the hall. 

[SERVICE] - 3/5
Average. Staff was nice, took our order, and informed us our order will be ready in 5 minutes so we didn't have to wait inside this shop. 

[DÉCOR] - 2/5 
VERY small and only a maximum of 3 people can stand comfortably in this place. There were many, many menu signs on the wall and windows. They also had snacks on display. Only 2 chairs were inside this place, but I wouldn't even recommend sitting inside. 

[QUALITY] - 2/5
Tea was average, but egg waffle was below average because it was hard and probably did not contain quality ingredients or the right mix of ingredients. 

[ORDER] - 2/5
- Passion Fruit Tea with Popping Boba $2.99 + 1 Free Egg Waffle: tea was refreshing and popping boba tasted good at first, but became too one-dimensional after a couple sips. Egg waffle hardened too quickly, but was still edible. 

[OVERALL] - 2/5
The price was good for the quantity of food when you order the combo. But if cheap food doesn't taste good, then it's not worth it at the end of the day. Unfortunately, I would not recommend the Egg Waffle at Pop Up House."}
{"text":"Tucked away in the T&T plaza on the second floor is this adorable little snack shop. Owned by a lovely couple, Pop Up House is mostly known for their egg waffles, bubble tea, and AMAZING deals. They also offer various snacks like hot dogs, fish balls, fries, etc. For under $5, yes, you read that right, UNDER $5, you can get a full on combo.

Now there isn't much with decor as unit sizes are quite limited on this floor. A lot of people order, pay, then wander elsewhere or sit outside the shop and wait. I'd say 15 min is a standard waiting time for them.

Now, I wouldn't say their egg waffles are exquisite, but they do put their heart into their food and are always courteous to their customers, so definitely some bonus points there. This place is CASH ONLY (at the moment) so remember to get cash before you come here. Then again, you always have at least 15 min to get it after ordering anyway. It does take quite a bit of time for the food to get to your hands, since it's only run by 2 people and they do get a lot of orders. But, it will be worth your money, and you get what you pay for. If you're in a rush, or on your lunch break in the area, I wouldn't suggest dropping by as you might be late getting back to wherever you came from.

All in all, it is a nice little shop to pick up some snacks/drink. Just remember to bring cash :)"}
{"text":"The cutest little shop in the plaza to get some super affordable snacks!

Upon entering, my friend and I were greeted by a kind couple. Menu items are posted all on the wall inside with super great deals! 
I have tried the drinks and bubble teas before and they were average. You get to customize your drink with many flavor and topping choices. 

However, I tried their egg waffle for the first time and I couldn't believe how much it tasted like the ones from home! The waffle bursted with a strong aromatic egg flavor and was light and crispy on the outside. The were many other flavor options as well, but I decided to try the original. 
The owner asked if we preferred softer or crispier and he was very very friendly and made sure he made it to our liking. 
I really enjoyed the egg waffle, especially since it's only $2! If you purchase a drink with it, it's only $1! I repeat, only $1!!

The taste of the waffle was very authentic and made with care. I will definitely come back to try their other flavors next time! 
I know there are so many new and different egg waffle shops popping up all over Markham and Toronto, but it's just something about this one that made me feel like a little kid again. 
I definitely  recommend anyone who walks by this store next time to give it a try!
(P.s. they only accept cash!"}
{"text":"I assume the older guy working there is the owner. Very friendly! I asked for half sweet on my ice lemon tea and after i take a sip he ask if sweet enough if not he can add more sweeter. $2 ho fish balls for 5 pieces very good deal. The prices are very good, but i thought the ice lemon tea was a bit much compare othet drinks. Good support small business. Will come back!"}
{"text":"The bubble waffle is not one I would order again. While this place is very cheap, the time it took for our order to come was just too long. We waited for over half an hour on 2 desserts. 

The presentation is nice and the ice cream is good, but the waffle is pretty disappointing. It wasn't fluffy at all. Instead, it was very eggy, thick, and not like your typical bubble waffle. It was a bit overcooked as well.

I ended up throwing half of it away (which made me feel terrible).

Maybe I'll try something else next time and hopefully my experience will be better. Not sure if I would return unless I'm in the area."}
{"text":"2.5 

Pop Up House is located in the 2nd Floor of T&T Unionville. Opens 7 days a week till 9 pm. The owner is really nice and I admire her dedication.

The 2 flavours cup is a great idea! I highly recommend that. Just so neat that you can have 2 different drinks in 1 order. You of course can share that with your date. The selection is a little overwhelming as you can have a combination of milk based or green/black tea based with toppings. And now they have a special if you buy a bbt, you will get a milk tea with 1 topping for free. So this is insanely cheap ($3.99 for 2 drinks!)

Hong Kong Egg Waffles for $1 with a purchase of a drink, I would not recommend the waffles at all. Though seems like great value, mine was overcooked. It was hard as a rock and dry. 

Pop Up House has potential as I can tell the owner really putting in a lot of time into the business. I won't suggest you go out of your way but if you are in the neighbourhood, maybe you can give them a try?

There are just so many bbt places in Markham, I don't really think they will be around if they don't make some improvements on their offerings,"}
{"text":"Heard about this place and decided to give it try as me and my friend were in the mood for a bubble waffle ice cream dessert. This is probably the most random little store that sells a very large variety of things (stationary, food, baby clothing?) but we only tried the food. 

My friend ordered the original bubble waffle with matcha ice cream, while I myself ordered a original milk tea with coffee jelly and a original bubble waffle. Both were $3.40 ($3+tax), very reasonably priced.  

My only downside in this experience was that I wanted tapioca in my drink but the owner said they had ran out as they were very busy during the day, which was honestly very surprising considering how hidden this store is. 

Bubble waffle was crispy and warm, had a nice egg flavor. Matcha ice cream was pretty good, just wish they added a bit more of it. Milk tea was also interesting (not sure if it was the coffee jelly that was a weird combination) but I did like the bitterness of tea, and it actually not that sweet for half sugar. 

Bonus points for the decoration on the ice cream. Pleasant surprise and super cute, made me enjoy the experience even more. Also funny to think that a middle aged man put two little pretzels and frootloops to make a face on the ice cream. 

TLDR: For the price, I'd definitely say this place is worth it. Comparable in taste to other bubble waffle ice cream places like Golden Bubbles, and way cheaper. In all honesty, you get what you pay for. I wasn't expecting a 10/10 but it was better than expected. Good service and cheap food, definitely would come back to try other things."}
{"text":"Random and lots of options and knick knacks overwhelm this store. The food is amazingly cheap but be warned that the portion is super tiny. Good idea for a snack but nothing to fill you up.

For under $5 I was able to get an original milk tea with tapioca, some sweet potato fries, 2 pieces of takoyaki, and ~3 fish balls. Lol not bad! Taste was average and nothing stood out. 

Do note that they also have double cup bubble tea here which is a nice option but taste wise wouldn't be up to par of your Chatime and the likes.

Overall if you're in the area and looking for a super small bite on budget then you might consider visiting here."}
{"text":"Ordered an avocado slush and an ice honey green tea yet they were the worst drinks I've ever had in my life! Not to mention the avocado slush didn't taste like avocado at all, the honey green tea had no taste of honey or tea but sugar water. I normally hate to waste food and drinks especially a good $6 but my husband and I couldn't stand it and had to throw the drinks away. Will never come back again"}
