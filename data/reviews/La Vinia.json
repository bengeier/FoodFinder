{"text":"We have been to Spain many times and love good Spanish food, this restaurant makes us feel like we are in Spain, their wine, tapas, main dishes and even coffee...totally Spanish"}
{"text":"I am pretty much new in Yelp. I am vacationing with my family and I decided to start reviewing the places we visit. I am from Toronto and this is absolotely our favourite restaurant! so I couldnt miss giving you guys the great review you deserve! Mango cheesecake is my favourite!"}

{"text":"Very friendly, attentive service.  Even the chef comes out to check on the patrons.  Good wine selection by the glass.  Amazing anchovies and excellent saffron mushroom shrimp dish!"}
{"text":"Walking into La Vinia feels like visiting an old friends' fancy house!

Chef Fernando Garcia is not only the chef - he is also the host and server at times, but make no mistake - it's a perfect balance for him and his family of workers. 

The Tapas of Pulpo a la Galena (Poached Octopus) was prepared to perfection! I've recently tried making grilled calamari and triumphantly failed.  :)
The Mejillones al Vapor (Fresh Mussles Steamed in Spanish Beer) was heavenly as well.

The Roasted Australian Lamb Chops and Paella de Marisco are both divine and well worth the cost of preparation.

The Chocolate Tartufo and Fried Milk are highly recommended. Truth is you can't go wrong with any of the dishes here. 

With the entreés, starters and desserts accompanied by the warm and genuine happiness of the service - I'd recommend La Vinia to any of my friends and family!"}
{"text":"Just a heads up because this place is small, it's best to make a reservation or chance being turned away as I was..."}
{"text":"It's a nice comfortable little spanish restaurant. Both the food and service were very good. Food price was resonable but wine was over priced."}
{"text":"We enjoyed everything; the waiter was knowledgeable, and professional. The tapas was wonderful. We had the Chicken and Seafood Paella and the Seafood Stew. Both were outstanding! We had no room for dessert, but the variety looked very tempting. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Anyone craving Spanish tapas and paella should look no further. Save your money and make the trek here! Worth the splurge, and even then the pricing was very reasonable.

Had the chance to try a variety of apps and mains, overall the quality was good on all dishes. Must try here = PAELLA! An awesome thing they offer at this restaurant is you can order your paella per person rather than needing a minimum number like other restaurants. One paella can easily feed 2-3 people. 

My recommendations are:
Paella Valenciana ($24.75), which has the chorizo, chicken, and seafood - this is the paella to beat
Arroz Negro ($24.75), which is the squid ink risotto - really flavorful and unique
Poached Octopus ($13.75) - had this buttery texture that melted in your mouth
Salmon croquette ($13.75) - nice texture that makes you crave for more

Good but probably would not re-order:
Paella de Marisco ($26.75), which had the shrimp, mussels, calamari, scallops, monkfish, and clam - tad too salty for more liking, but enjoyed by the seafood lovers in my group
Sauteed shrimp with garlic and chili oil $14.75) - nothing to rave about
Fried milk dessert ($10) - a bit generic and small (2 pieces) given the price

Note is that there is only side parking on the street with a paid meter, so it's a bit limited on busier nights. That said, it is free on weekend evenings.

We went for a birthday, and they kindly offered a very delectable slice of mango cheesecake! I also tried their fried milk ($10), which was good, but a bit un-memorable for the price."}
{"text":"After returning from a trip to Barcelona, among other places, I was in the mood to have some Spanish food. The problem is I had no idea where to go. I came across this gem by researching. I was amazed by the fantastic reviews and ratings and had to go see what all the fuss was about. Now I know and it was everything I had read and then some. 

The owner Fernando Garcia is a rarity, someone who actually cares about his customers. My family was extremely impressed by the attention he paid, coming to our table several times to ensure everything was to our liking. The food was wonderful and both the meal and the service exceeded all our expectations. 

If you're in the mood for Spanish food that tastes as good as it did in Spain (actually better), you should check out LaVinia. It was well worth the trip!!!"}
{"text":"A real joy to have this place in the neighborhood! My wife and I love traditional Spanish food and La Vinia will not disappoint."}
{"text":"We ordered:
Salmon carpaccio
Roasted quail
Crab croquettes
Shrimp in garlic and olive oil
Seafood paella

We were served bread but no butter or any dip. Odd. Tasted the bread and it was super cold?? The first dish we received was the shrimp with was good, hot and tasted good but there were 4 shrimp for $14. Next was the crab and there was really good, except the fact that they were cold in the middle. The dip they came with was really good too. Next we received the quail, which was really good. No complaints! The salmon carpaccio was good with mango drizzle. I've never had carpaccio before so nothing to compare to. 

Lastly, the paella took forever but I understand. When we finally received it, it was excellent! This is the only dish that stood out along with the shrimps.

I don't know because maybe we went on an off day or understaffed because the food was not consistent. Plus, we noticed we never received pesto with our bread. I had really high hopes because of all the reviews.."}
{"text":"Simply divine experience. Great food, wonderful service. It's cozy, with supreme emphasis on fresh ingredients and flavours. Chef Fernando makes us feel at home."}
{"text":"At 830 on a Saturday night the restaurant was packed. We started with a crisp Albariño (a personal favourite) and some boquerones. We had ham croquetas, pimientos rellenos, pulpo a la gallega and paella. The food was the most authentic Spanish I've had in Toronto. It's clear that the chef takes great pride in his work. 

The portions could have been a bit bigger and it was by no means an inexpensive meal, though not prohibitive either."}
{"text":"I've been going to La Vinia since it opened and I've never been disappointed.. Fernando's food is the ultimate Spanish experience and the service is spectacular.  His son, Jamie, is professional and so efficient yet makes you feel special.  We've tried most items on the menu and can't complain about anything.   The wine list covers every need, if you want tapas the menu will satisfy you without question.  My husband and I usually do just that but have had several entrees and have enjoyed every one. It' a gem in the hood for sure.."}
{"text":"I can't really put a rating on it. All positive reviews in Yelp, including acquaintances in Facebook who raved about it.  The Tapas and soup seemed OK.  But we were disappointed with the paella.  I prefer Segovia.  Service is amazing.  The owner has a family vineyard - the Rioja was quite nice.  I don't understand why the paella underwhelmed."}
{"text":"Just happened upon this place on a drive along Lakeshore. Excellent service. We weren't too familiar with tapas so we asked the waiter to help us order. We ordered the mussels, the chicken croquettes, avocado salad, and the shrimp. Plenty of food and it was all fresh and tasty. Will definitely be back even though its a little out of our way."}
{"text":"After reading the praise on here, I feel almost guilty leaving only 3 stars.  The truth is we did not have an exceptional experience here.

Everything that you read is true.  The food is great and good quality.  Our chicken croquettes were delicious although the spinach and goat cheese was a literally just a small pan of semi-wilted spinach and a huge chunk of goat cheese.  Two of us had meat dishes (the lamb chops were amazing) and the other two had paella (both of which were a little burnt on the bottom).  Overall, the food was impressive and reasonably priced.

Where our experience really fell short was the service.  We arrived 10 minutes before a group of 14 however they seemed to monopolize everything.  Rather than put our order through first, we waited almost two hours (I'm not even exaggerating) for our food while the huge group got served and left before us.  In a restaurant with two kitchen staff, you should never serve a huge group before a small table.

Other reservations started showing up and the small restaurant was in a trap.  No tables were even close to free although we would've left an hour ago if they hadn't put our order through second.  

Overall, we spent 3.5 hours for dinner at this place - borderline 2 hours too long.  I realize this is maybe an exception to most peoples experience but it was certainly annoying enough that I likely won't return."}
{"text":"Came here for girlfriends birthday. Tucked away on lakeshore between some old apartment buildings and convenience stores, this place is an absolute gem. Had the grilled octopus, seared scallops, seafood paella, and squid ink risotto. Every single one of the dishes blew us away in terms of taste and presentation. The scallops are absolutely to die for, but it's a special item for the day, so it might not be available every time you go. Definitely will go again, until I try out every dish on their menu."}
{"text":"Food was good. Auxie (waitress) not so much... chef came out and was extremely friendly. If you can ask for Jaime, he was much more pleasant. Make sure you make a reservation otherwise you will be rudely \"squeezed in\" to an empty restaurant."}
{"text":"Service was good; food was a disaster. Meal started with cold bread and a pesto dipping sauce which tasted a bit acrid. Next, we had two appetizers, grilled calamari and octopus. The calamari was ok, but a bit chewy, and sitting in a pool of olive oil. The octopus, allegedly the chef's specialty, had ultra slimy skin, though the meat was indeed tender.  The dish, however, was very rich (due to the octopus swimming in chili oil) and lacked acid--no lemon, citrus or vinegar to counteract the richness. 

Our evening finished with an extremely underwhelming, expensive and greasy rendition of paella. A few scant (3 or 4 mussels and 2 pieces of shrimp) pieces of seafood coupled with very undercooked rice--again drenched in chili oil. Almost no saffron flavour. No soccarat on the bottom of the paella pan. Did I mention hardly any seafood and greasy rice?

Staff and owner seemed very nice, but the food was absolutely deplorable. Wouldn't have dinner there again even for free. 

Everything you order is drenched in some sort of oil. It makes everything seem greasy and takes away from the flavour of the food."}
{"text":"Everything tasted amazing, different from anything I tried in the city which definitely added to the experience. Chicken croquettes and the Spanish ham plate 
were my favourite tapa plates. The chef came to greet us and the server was perfect! I give this place 5 stars!"}
{"text":"After reading all the great reviews, we came to La Vinia hoping to get an authentic Spanish dining experience. We tried to make online reservations, but could only get 6 or 9 pm. We called and was told 8 pm was the earliest. However, when we arrived early around 7:30 pm, the restaurant was empty and got our table right away. So not sure why they refused to give us an earlier reservation. 

The chef came out to personally explain the daily specials and his recommendations. He was very friendly, and I can see that he really strives to ensure his customers are satisfied.

For appetizers, we ordered:
- Grilled Spanish Chorizo with Ratatouille ($14.75). The Chorizo was not spicy nor salty and went well with the Ratatouille. This dish was delicious. 
- Poached Octopus Marinated in Olive Oil and Pimenton ($14.75). Was soft and tasty, but personally I prefer the octopus from Ufficio and Joso. 
- Fine Iberico Spanish Ham ($23.75). Wasn't too salty and quite tasty, but didn't seem to have the rich flavor profile as the high-grade Iberico ham from Barcelona.
- Fresh White Anchovies with Olive Oil and Vinegar ($14.75). These anchovies were really delicious and not salty at all. Highly recommended.

For the main course, we ordered:
- Paella de Marisco ($26.75). This dish was loaded with seafood and a great value for the price. I would prefer if it had a little less oil, but still quite delicious.
- Lamb Shank (daily special). Very soft, tender, and tasty. Highly recommended.

For the dessert, we ordered:
- Fried Milk ($10). Although tasty, for two tiny pieces, this was totally not worth it. Would skip. 

Unfortunately, by the time we had finished our meal, we noticed a large number of ants crawling around on our table. There must have been 20-30 ants, so they have a serious pest control problem. When we mentioned to our server, she offered to replace the table cloth and said that they would investigate afterward. Frankly, I was expecting a more sincere apology, and they could have at least offered to remove that lackluster dessert off the bill... 

The service here is excellent, as the chef came out numerous times during the meal and after the meal to check on us. The servers came by frequently to refill our waters and exchange our plates and cutlery. The food here is quite good with some dishes being really great (anchovies, lamb shank, paella), others just average (octopus and ham), and the dessert bad. The atmosphere is nice, but by 9 pm, the place got busy and really loud, so it was hard to have a conversation without yelling. The ant problem is quite gross, but luckily we had finished our meal and were ready to leave, so wasn't a huge deal for us (hopefully they can address it before their next health inspection). Overall, a pretty good Spanish dining experience."}
{"text":"Great evening. Impeccable service. Excellent food. The paella and the octopus were just exceptional. Wish the wine list had a greater selection of Spanish wines. Tempranillos welcome."}
{"text":"An intimate, no nonsense contemporary setting that seats at most 30 or 40 people. Excellent food with wonderful flavours and colours and top notch service. The paella (de marisco) we had skewed salty. The poached octopus was wonderfully tender. They had a special of gazpacho that was the best I've ever had (they serve it light and filtered). Great dining experience - very different vibe from Patria on king West."}
{"text":"Best place for Spanish Tapas and Paella in the west end 
Chef Alonso is great, always try's something innovative
The place is small and is crowded during rush hours, reservation is highly recommended
The service is very good and attentive 
Parking is a challenge but free on weekends 
Great place for a Spanish fiesta"}
{"text":"What a wonderful gem of a restaurant! I went with my family while on vacation in Toronto. The chef/owner is a kind man who knows his way around the kitchen and knows how to keep his customers happy. He and his son, who was our waiter, were so friendly to my 3 year old nephew and made our dining experience great.  All of the food was delicious from appetizers to dessert and the Sangria was pretty great also.
Anytime that I'm in Toronto, I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"We arrived at a small homey restaurant called La Vinia.  The waiters and waitresses were pleasant.  They were very helpful with the menu and gave some really good recommendations too.  Everything looked so delicious, I'm pretty sure we ended up ordering half the menu.

{"text":"Was here last night with my Venuzualen girlfriend and another couple.  The place is small and was packed.  Reservations are a must here.  Although we came in time we had to wait a bit but the owner (executive chef) and his son who ran the front of the house were amazing.  Offered us drinks and an appetizer on the house for our wait.

This place is a hidden gem.  The servers, the chef who came out personally multiple times were top notch.  The food was beyond extrodinary.  All the pictures you see posted by other reviews are legit. This is exactly what you will get.  The octopus was beyond tender.  Imported from Spain and braised for 5-6 hours.  It was so tender you could mistake it for a Yukon Gold potatoe.  Everything tasted so good.  My GF who is more than familiar with Latin cuisine said is was all spot on and a bit of a taste from home.

I highly recommend this place. It was outstanding.  Nice to see such care and detail to food and service."}
{"text":"My husband and I, along with our son, have come here to celebrate our wedding anniversery for the last 3 years and it is an absolute pleasure to eat at La Vinia every time!

Absolutely love the grilled calamari, great char, very delicious, and the Valenciana paella is a must! Delicious rice, chicken, shrimp and sausage! That plus the wine always leave me feeling warm and lovely. 

Along with the delicious food, the service is just spectacular. The owner and his son, the entire staff really- they care about their customers! They are so kind and really make you feel welcome and at home. The owner is in his kitchen, cookin' it up, coming out to chat with you and make sure everything is wonderful. I just really appreciate them for being great people and not being one of those restaurants that make you feel uncomfortable (the fancy pants, pinkies out type, lol). 

They have always left us with a sweet treat to celebrate, so charming (and the chocolate raspberry sorbet is amazing!). 

Love this place so much, I always leave feeling warm, full, and happy! :)"}

{"text":"Wonderful food and service...I would highly recommend. This was our first time at the restaurant and it was a birthday celebration. The restaurant is local and we drive pass it very day. La Vinia was much better then we expected, even our picky eater had a wonderful meal - much to their surprise. We had a number of the tapas plates and were very impressed. 

Our favorites were the shrimp, meatballs, chicken croquettes and baked spinach, but all the dishes were very flavorful. The service is impeccable with our plates and cutlery cleared a few times. 

The wine list is good and it was fun to see Spanish beers."}
{"text":"After living less than a few blocks away for a few years now the wife and I finally decided to give La Vinia a try. Boy were we glad we did!

We started with the black prosciutto croquettes (unreal!), avocado salad (delicious!) and the squid. I would rank them in that order, the croquettes were so good but nothing was bad.

We then had the Paella as a main shared between us which was very tasty. 

The service was fantastic all night long and with a bottle of wine dinner came to about $130ish which was more than fair.

It is really nice to eat out the way things used to be where service exists and even the chef pops out to tables to say hello to the guests.

We will definitely be returning to La Vinia and my wife already took her father back just a week later."}
{"text":"Excellent service and good food, came here for my birthday dinner and the waiters and owner came by multiple times to check up on us. A little expensive for the portion size of the appetizer but otherwise it was a good experience!"}
{"text":"I went here for dinner last night for some tapas with a friend. The service was friendly and the food was exceptional. The chef even visited our table to ask about our meal, which I thought was so professional and sophisticated. I cannot wait to go back here! Suggestion to future guests: get the crab croquettes - they are to die for."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, very attentive. Food was good. Will definitely come back. The Chef even came put to say hi during our meal. Exceptional service"}
{"text":"I'm totally torn on this place - maybe 3.5, if that was an option :)

The food was fresh and lovely, the staff were nice, and the chef/owner/whatever guy comes out and checks on your happiness level with your meal. Nice, clean, intimate place. 

We got grilled calamari (well cooked, but plain grilled), garlic shrimp (super tasty and fresh, but $14 for 4 pieces), mushroom something (REALLY tasty, but again pricey), chicken croquettes (group enjoyed them), and grilled spinach with goat cheese (pretty great). 

Also got veg paella, and the mixed one. Both went over great with the group, and we shared 2 personal sized ones between four and that was enough with the tapas. They're like $25 each. We got desserts, too. They were fine, but nothing to write home about.  

Overall a good experience, but pretty expensive for what it was. Nice enough staff for sure, but nothing over the top. Good for a group of four, but probably kinda much for a date night or something."}
{"text":"A lovely, small Spanish restaurant in the Mimico / New Toronto area!  I had it bookmarked for a while and decided to visit La Vinia for my bday dinner.

Atmosphere
Restaurant is small!  There are only about a dozen or so tables, so reservations are highly recommended.  Yes, even on a random weekday!  I visited on a Thursday evening and it was a full house.

Mid-way through the meal, the chef does come to each table to check in on you.  He seemed very warm and like he really cared.

Food
We ordered a sangria (white, but it looked like pink grapefruit colour), 2 tapas (pulpo, chicken croquettes), an order of paella de mariscos (seafood), mango cheesecake, & coffee.  This was good enough for 2 ppl, we were stuffed!  Highlights from those dishes were the chicken croquettes (light, mousse-like filling) and the cheesecake.  

Paella was good too, especially the initial bites, but I wished there was more saffron flavour and less salt or even garlic.  It did feel a bit heavier when comparing to paellas I've had in Barcelona.  Seafood was cooked beautifully though, especially the monkfish!

Pulpo was again, soo tender, but I didn't find the dish itself had that much flavour - neither the pieces of octopus nor the potatoes.  Other than a hint of pimenton, it was on the bland side, even the potatoes.

Skip:  Sangria, especially \"white\" sangria and perhaps order the house wine instead.  Apparently, the chef's name is on it and you can't get it elsewhere.  They do also have a good wine list of stuff that didn't seem readily available at the LCBO, so take advantage of that!  

Also skip the coffee (a bit watery) and just go for an espresso.

Service
Excelente!  Absolutely no complaints about the service.  Every server seemed happy to be there to serve you.  We had a tall, skinny guy, who was friendly and helpful especially with suggestions.

I'd definitely be open to visiting again to try other items!  It is on the pricier side, so keep that in mind.  The entire menu is online, so it should come as no surprise.  :)"}
{"text":"Love.  Love.  Love.  Great ambiance, friendly service, piping hot, well-seasoned food.  It was lovely that the owner came by the table to welcome us and check our satisfaction.  Paella was perfect, and not too pretentious that they wouldn't omit an ingredient.  A bit pricey for what you get, but overall, worth it.  Wine was cheaper to order by the glass than by the bottle--strange.  it's nice to see the Lakeshore becoming more interesting!!  Good luck, La Vinia!!"}
{"text":"Went in for my mother's birthday and got a free mango cheesecake. 

We went with 2 tapas: the iberico ham and the veal
The veal we finished with ease as it was so delicious, while we slowly finished the iberico ham. We were asked why we were slow on the iberico ham, and we mentioned that it was slightly worse than the veal. They told us that it was from a wild pig. So its meat texture is heavier. The owner compared the meat with rolex and seiko."}
{"text":"Great Spanish food and excellent service. Took the family there. Ordered a range of Tapas followed by Paella and Pasta for kids. Appreciated Fernando taking the time out of the kitchen to welcome us. Food was excellent! PaellaValencia had the right balance of seafood, chicken and chorizo and saffron was perfectly balanced."}
{"text":"We love this place.  Its quaint, intimate and has great service.  The chef always comes out to greet you and the menu is great.  The white anchovy with manchego is the best... and the paella is deceptively large and easily feeds 2 so be warned!  If you have the chance to try the zuchini flower croquettes they are a must.  The grilled octopus is tender and perfectly cooked ...one of our faves !"}
{"text":"We ordered the beer-cooked mussels and the seafood paella. Everything was immaculately prepared, from the homemade pesto spread to the delicate yet delicious shrimp in the paella pan. Excellent meal, and overwhelmingly generous hospitality. I will definitely be visiting here again!"}
{"text":"Like the paellla and shrimp! (Gambas) the service is pretty good! Also, a glass of Sangria make you relaxed!"}
