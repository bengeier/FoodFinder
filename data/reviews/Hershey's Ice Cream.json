{"text":"Great ice cream and food but sometimes feel unwelcome. If you go in near closing time you definitely won't be greeted with a smile."}
{"text":"Nice local place to get ice cream and food, such as hot dogs, chicken paprikash and daily specials like pierogies with kielbasa, and taco salad. Their website, hersheys-elyria.com. shows their menu and a daily specials calendar."}
{"text":"Chicken paprikash is the best In the whole area!  Always have great service and ice cream."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Elyria. They have a nice variety of healthy food to comfort food and great ice cream options. They also sell chocolate covered pretzels, krispie treats, and cookies, along with homemade buckeyes and ice cream sandwiches & cakes. I love that they are open late-til 10:30pm."}
{"text":"This was one of my old favorite places to go around Elyria. Since new ownership it's not totally the same. The ice cream here is the same but the food used to be so great! Now I only stop by for an occasional cone.

The employees are still great and very friendly. You are welcomed when you enter the shop. However, the new owners are not. It made me sad to see the original owners go but I understand taking different business ventures."}
