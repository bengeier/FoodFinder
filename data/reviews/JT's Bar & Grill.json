{"text":"Great wings...cool place to chill"}
{"text":"Excellent Neighborhood ShitHole ! Consistently inconsistent, seldom open and catering to EVERY demographic in the PHX. 
Can't wait to pass on this place for years to come ! Owner must be proud. 
Cheers & good luck"}
{"text":"Hands down, best wings I've ever had ANYWHERE. Big shout out to Julio, he does them the best. Bar has divey atmosphere and a hint of sports bar persona."}
{"text":"Wow!  This place is so tiny, but yet they are able to cram every important part of a bar into this little space.  

#1 - Awesome bartender!  We went on a Saturday and Posey (not sure of the spelling) was serving us.  She joked around with us immediately and gave crap to some of the regulars, which was HYSterical!  We never waited for a drink.

#2 - Wings Wings Wings!  They were incredible.  They deep fry the FRESH chicken wings, then turn them in the sauce (many different flavors to choose from including suicide, a little mix of all) and then throw them on the grill.  I ordered the hot wings and they were both temperature hot and spicy hot - just perfect.  

#3 - Small but still there smoking patio.  

#4 - Satellite TV and football games on multiple TV's

Can't get much better than this.  This was our first time in and the regulars welcomed us as if we had been coming there for 10 years!  We will definitely be back.  The wings are just too awesome not to have again."}
{"text":"JTs is the best bar to go to whether it's for HH during the week or on the weekend. Always a great atmosphere with the absolute best wings of all time- the works or medium! I love it so much that I ask for JTs gift cards for holidays!"}
{"text":"Uuugh!!!! What a rip off. I came in from out of town and hung out with my buddy Joe. He highly recommended JT's because of their awesome wings and tiny tacos. What he didn't know was that most of the positive reviews of this place on Yelp are ancient reviews from when Julio was still working there. This place had the kiss of death and was taken over by cheap, shady owners. The new owners want to cut cost but still cash in on the positive word of mouth about the food. They also raised the prices. So in essence, the new owners are producing a cr@p product and charging us more money! To add insult to injury they shorted us 2 chicken wings. Talk about trifflin'!! If they're shorting people wings, I'd hate to know what they're doing to their drinks. When we got them they were cold all the way down to the bones and stale like they had been made as a mistake earlier in the day, boxed up and given to us (short 2 wings!!!). The tacos were bland like they just cooked some ground beef without seasoning and threw it in the shell. I added the salsa to try to add some flavor to it but it didn't cut it. I'm sure MY taco has more flavor than this one did. Most of the wings and tacos are still in the fridge and will inevitably meet their fate at the bottom of the garbage can. In conclusion, if you want over priced, piece of cr@p wings that don't taste half as good as frozen ones and tacos that taste better when they come out of you than going in, go to JTs so they can pi$$ on you face and tell you it's raining!
*Additionally, don't believe the review underneath mines. I'm almost 100% positive it was done by someone who works for them or has some sort of affiliation with this place. It's written like an advertisement. The wings look NOTHING like they do in that picture. This review would be VASTLY different if they did. Our wings were all limp and flaccid when they showed up to film. Nice try you guys. You make me sick."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a casual, comfortable and friendly place to go eat and drink at, Jts is the best! Wing specials on Monday, 2 for 1 burgers (YUM!) on Tuesday, and Taco Thursday! Love the food, atmosphere and friendly people who go there. I will keep going back again and again to this neighborhood gem!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of J.T.'s.  Reasonable drinks and REALLY good wings.  It's small, so it can get pretty crowded, but the people are friendly, service is good, too.  J.T. 's is a great neighborhood bar, nearly free of any douchebaggery."}
{"text":"What a find! Such a classic little hole in the wall local bar.  The best of what it should be, great people and great food in a fun environment.  And not a run down hole in the wall, its actually clean.  Will return"}
{"text":"Hands down best bar in the nation. I go here a few times a week. The food is amazing and the bartenders and waitress are friendly and gorgeous. Even if it's packed the waitress is always right there with a smile. I recommend the wings and taco thursdays! it's a great place to go to watch the game. go sooners!"}
{"text":"Awesome food. Best Wings in phoenix. Great staff. Never had a bad meal there. Julio does a fantastic job cooking."}
{"text":"This is the best local go-to bar!!  They have the best chicken wings around, amazing service and perfect atmosphere for a fun time!!  You won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"A true dive bar that makes you feel comfortable. As a traveler for work, sitting in the hotel room on a Friday night was just not going to work.  So I fire up my trusty yelp app. and off I go. JTs was not hard to find and even less hard to enjoy.

The place is small. Barely large enough to walk past the stools.  The bar is clean and dark. The decor is very reminiscent of underground grunge clubs.  The bartenders were very nice and easy on the eyes. They were accommodating and never made you feel like you were bothering them.

I had two blue moons and two margaritas and the works hot wings. The wings were excellent though by the time they got to me the two blur moons had inhibited my ability to properly taste food. Anyway, the wings were crunchy and lightly sweet with a hint of whatever sauce they used.  They were not smothered so the taste was well balanced.  Granted this is not one of those places you go for margaritas but
It is my favorite drink so I had to try.  The margaritas did not impress but I never expected them to.

I had some conversation with random people while waiting to sober up. The bar tender did not rush me and let me take my time before I was well enough to drive.  Don't drink and drive kids!

By the way, thanks to two female patrons at the bar for their interesting perspective on mixed martial arts.  I won't mention it here so people can go to the bar and have the interesting conversation themselves.

Definitely if I was a resident of Phoenix I would come here frequently.  I love local places like this."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday, pretty plain bloody Mary's but the wings are amazing!! If you're like us and always looking for great wings, defiantly check this place out."}
{"text":"Best wings in Phoenix, hands down!  All the comments are right! Crispy, juicy, delicious!  JT's is the perfect neighborhood hangout.  You must go.  The bartenders are awesome and so are the cooks.  They get to know you and when you come in again they have your \"usual\" ready for you.  Very hard to find a place like this in a large city.  Fantastic!"}
{"text":"The beer bottles on ice and great chicken wings make you feel like you're at an awesome tailgate party, all the way down to the port-a-potty bathrooms. If you're not too prim and proper, and you like to have a good time, JT's is the place. It's got a very regular Baja Arcadia crowd but is friendly to newcomers also. Put a couple of bucks in the jukebox and play Johnny Cash, kick back, and let the hours waste away."}
{"text":"The wings are the shizzzzzz. Also, good times and good people. They have beer and food and games. The guac rules. Everything rules and everyone should go here. I am adding more words so this review will be accepted. Yay Yelp."}
{"text":"The\"owner\", (some bald tool) of this place told my friend he had to leave. This was after loading the jukebox and ordering drinks. If you enjoy alcoholic bars this is for you. And by alcoholic I mean \"owner\" specifically."}
{"text":"Were the wings the best I've ever had? Probably. I love the divey feel of the place too. Definitely my kind of bar. The only thing that bumped it down was how warm my beer was. I know that's a bit picky, but I expect my beer to be cold dammit!"}
{"text":"Wings on wings on wings. If you come here they are a must and while your at it get a beer from one of the local breweries they have on draft... Take a cab, they'll call one for you."}
{"text":"I've been going here at least twice a month for the past six/seven years.  JT is a hoot.  They have the best wings in the Valley.  Great jukebox.  The new cafe tables are nice, but hard when you have a big group.

Love this place."}
{"text":"BEST WINGS EVER!!!!  Service is slow but it's worth it!  Burgers are good too but the wings are outstanding!"}
{"text":"Outstanding wings and friendly service. The bartender was great; she was on top of everything. It was busy but she made sure everyone had drinks whenever they needed. The wings were perfect; fried, then sauced, then grilled. No breading and no sloppy sauce. Perfect. Decent beer selection, full bar. I'm an out-of-towner but the place felt very comfortable. Try it!!"}
{"text":"JT's is great, the food is wonderful (even the rare off the menu stuff), the staff is always working hard and being nice, the location is great, its not full of Scottsdale DB's.  JT can forever rest knowing that his bar is in the hands of good people."}
{"text":"Been going to this place for years! The burgers are solid and the wings are some of the best I've had. Can't beat their daily specials either."}
{"text":"So the Bartender / Manager was Sassy and super funny.  Felt like I was back home. Great local spot. Food was excellent and service was top notch. Great spot to watch a game and chill. They are known for their wings but the Chicken taco's were amazing. I was told the chef makes his own salsa."}
{"text":"FIRST - make NO MISTAKE - this is a dive bar.  But as a purist - the wings are fantastic.  The Works are the best - fried, tossed then grilled - just outstanding.  Only tried that & the medium but both were incredible.  Fries were usual frozen non-player.  Nice beer selection - waitstaff is friendly, once they get around to you.  This place is REALLY small and still smells like a 70's smoking lounge.
Only complaint - 2 of my wings were so small, they would make an Ethiopian rancher blush - nothing there but seasoning & bone.
Overall taste was a 5 but experience knocked one off."}
{"text":"I really liked this hole-in-the-wall.  Yes the grille wings rock!!"}
{"text":"Really good small place! Wings are awesome and  Kate is a really good bartender with personality."}
{"text":"We heard about the wings and we weren't disappointed. I tried the spicy honey bbq the works and the hot wings. The hot wings were the best of the three. The works and the honey bbq were close in flavor so I'd recommend only one of the sweet ones to go with the spicy. Our service was amazing. The place was packed and there were only two people working the server was very attentive and quick with refills"}
{"text":"I ordered wings to go on January 17, 2016 and they were great! However, the bartender there (long blonde hair) was extremely rude and could care less that I was a customer when I came in. She was more concerned with entertaining her friends than taking the time to even ask my name when I placed the order. Too bad, because the wings were great and I will never go back again due to this person completely disrespect attitude.

Please get someone better! Looks don't beat good service."}
{"text":"They messed up one of our 3 to-go orders, but they didn't charge us for any add-ons like upgrading to onion rings. Burger was good! Not life changing, but a solid effort, especially for being a to-go order."}
{"text":"Fun dive joint with surprisingly great food. Honestly, favorite chicken wings in town. They fry them, toss in sauce and then put em to the grill. It's the most amazing combination ever. Get your wings \"the works,\" it's an insider flavor that's sweet and spicy. I get mine with a side of hot sauce cuz I love my wings spicy! They also have homemade ranch which is totally dope."}
{"text":"The bartenders are ahhhhhmazzzzing! Don't know how they do it! Had a medium rare filet  tonight. Steak night duh why wouldn't you get the Wednesday night steak special! Herman is a great chef! They have a jukebox ... Awesome! Go to JTs and you will be winning! I heart Megs!"}
{"text":"Best dive bar. Ever.  Go see Beth and order yourself a \"Clint Black.\" You can thank me later."}
{"text":"Great wings .... place is small and cramped but gives it its own kind of personality... its a cool place to hang out and have a beer and shoot the bull!! I would come back ... mostly for the wings lol"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place. Has a fun, welcoming atmosphere. Reminds me of some Boston bars, especially Daisy Buchanan's. We had the 2 for 1 cheeseburger special. Very tasty. Served with lots of nice, salty, hot fries. Anything better? I think not. Bar was crowded but the 1 server did a masterful job of getting drinks and food out for all the customers. We were the oldest by far, but no one treated us like \"olds\". Would absolutely go back."}
{"text":"My favorite dive bar in the universe! If you want to go somewhere with friends that has dirt cheap drinks, a rad jukebox, & awesome random people, then JT's is it!

Allegedly, I got really drunk here, danced my ass off on the dance floor that exists in my mind, met the owner, got a free t-shirt, ordered a pizza delivered there at 1AM, made several inappropriate life decisions, & ended the night with an $18 bar tab & a taxi ride home. Allegedly.

I lost the fabulous free t-shirt they gave me too. The front of it said- DUH! I mean, can you get any more classy than that?

If you can't have fun here, then you should see a doctor cause you're probably all bunged up."}
{"text":"Awesome local bar!  Surprisingly good food! Grilled wings and tacos!   Bathrooms are clean!"}
{"text":"Holy moly WINGS! Get them! They are grilled and made to order. Went on a busy Friday night but was able to snag a seat at the bar. The wait for food was a little long (lots of takeout orders happening and to be fair I was very hungry). I enjoyed some beer and watched March Madness on the tele. Ambiance was great, people were happy and a good variety of music was playing. Bartenders were friendly and attentive. I love casual laid back places and this is def one. Overall great experience!"}
{"text":"This is one of great little places that has such a feel good vibe to it, excellent service and Outstanding food...The wings truly are the best I've had anywhere...Better than Hooters, they really go the extra mile on them.  They seriously are a tad meatier than most others, and the finished grilled touch makes them extra special.  I love this fun little narrow bar! Great place to kick back, have a few drinks, eat some great food, and enjoy yourself!  Be patient on the food and as everything as custom made!  Well worth the wait..."}
{"text":"Best wings I've had in Phoenix - they're fried fresh, tossed in the sauce of your choice (get \"the works\"), then GRILLED afterwards. They're definitely on the smaller side, though. Service is there, but nothing to write home about. I didn't find my bartender very friendly, and I had to prepare my orders in advance so I can get them in whenever we made eye contact. And this is with me sitting at the bar! I think she was new, though, so I'll let that slide. At the end of the day, I got everything I wanted. As for the ambiance...I found all the Sooners paraphernalia quite charming, even though I have no special ties to OU. A great neighborhood, mom & pop bar. Not recommended for families, claustrophobes (?), and people with disdain for styrofoam cups and red Solo cups."}
{"text":"All I really need to say is GRILLED WINGS.... but I shall say more in detail. They have the BEST wings in town! They fry the wings, but also grill them. All the staff is VERY nice and friendly. If you go more then a few times, they will know you and know what you will be ordering! Every time I have gone to JT''s it has been busy, so that say's something about the place. So if your mouth is watering and craving wings, JT's is your spot!"}
{"text":"5 stars for their food and service, 3 stars for the size of the place. They really need to buy out a few businesses next door to accommodate their crowd. Love this place though."}
{"text":"I usually don't write reviews but felt like people should be forewarned about this place. Chuck, the manager of this bar, verbally abused a patron who was sitting at the bar near me for no apparent reason. This manager (heavy bald guy with a golf polo) was drinking what appeared to be red wine with ice and was slurring his words. Dive bars are usually unprofessional but this was the worst I've seen."}
{"text":"Best neighborhood bar you could ask for! They always have friendly staff and great food and drinks. They make some of the best margaritas around. I highly recommend the medium wings. They are cooked to perfection by the best wing chef in the Valley. The BLT is one of my favorite things to get here. A triple-decker beauty that is worthy of its own zip code."}
{"text":"Best dive bar in Arcadia. Their wings are the best in town! Always have good music playing while showing sports. I highly recommend this restaurant/bar."}
{"text":"Great dive bar with a great \"happening\" feel, good food, and perfectly toned attitude. The wings are superior. There is no happy hour - I kind of like that. I used to go to a place that had a sign up that said \"No happy hour 4pm to 6pm.\"  I felt at home. It was crowded, loud, and small. The energy was invigorating. In an age of hundreds of craft beers, JTs has a limited selection of generic lagers that felt just right. The whole vibe was - \"get out of here, yuppie scum!\""}
{"text":"wings are so good! they're grilled, but not over-charred. delicious and reasonably priced. the place itself is very very small so be prepared to wait. i went on a saturday early afternoon and got lucky with no wait for 2."}
{"text":"This is the dive bar that connects Phoenix and Scottsdale. Why do we love it so? Well, of course, .50 Taco Night (Thursday)! What else do you need? Some draft beer, a few good friends, kick ass conversation and some damn good tacos .

Oh yeah, J.T is a Sooner!

Boomer Sooner! Go OU!"}
{"text":"I think this goes without saying but BEST WINGS EVER. If only I could eat them every day, I would. Service is always pretty good, the only time I've had any trouble is when they're super slammed but that's understandable. I wish they had a slightly larger beer selection but it's a dive so what do you do. Honestly the bartender could probably punch me in the face and I would still give this place 5 stars. That's how much I love those wings."}
{"text":"Time stands still at this watering hole full of nicely dressed drunks. It was almost two years since my last visit, but nothng seemed to have changed as a loud drunk (just like my last time) had posted up at the bar and was telling anybody within earshot that \"i am drunk and I don't give a blank.\" It probably is more of the management's fault that they just overserve the guy, then let him harass patrons (not me, but the guy next to me) and then watch and wave goodbye to him as he jumps in his car with 10 beers in his system. Arcadia's finest, more golf shirts than T-shirts also at this dive bar for people with money, who are slumming and cheap at the same time. 
    Oh yeah, had two tacos for 95 cents each. Those are also the same too, but the Mexican dude in the back needs to find a pair of gloves after he makes tacos each time with his bare hands. Sometimes nostaglia is overrated."}
{"text":"Don't know what the hype is about the wings. Although they are meaty, they have no real authentic flavor. I could taste lots of salt and the burnt from grilling.
This place is tiny, noisy and if you sneeze, you'll pass it.
Folks were smoking right outside the front door, so you got a whiff of second hand smoke as you enter or exit. Good luck finding a place to park.
The one good thing about JT's is that the bartender the night we were in was good looking and very friendly guy with exceptional service."}
{"text":"After a long day of running errands, finishing up our Christmas lights, yard work and Christmas shopping, our friends suggested we get some beers and wings. What a perfect idea! 

My fiancé and I have been to this bar before but only for drinks. Our friends told us that they loved the wings here so the last time we came, we were so glad they introduced the wings to us. 

If you like dry wings that  are deep-fried and grilled, this is the place for you. I've never been a fan of my food drenched in sauces so these were perfect for me. Perfect sizes and great ranch for dipping. Seriously my favorite wings in town. I've gotten medium wings both times and my fiancé gets hot. If you have leftovers, just pop them in the oven and get them toasty. Or you can be like my fiancé - eat them cold out of the fridge when you are hungover the next morning. 

It's a tiny dive bar so don't expect to find a table for a group larger than 4. If you sit at the bar, you can see the chefs cooking your wings. Like I said, it's a small place. Great local business!"}
{"text":"JT's is the perfect neighborhood bar. It's low key and so fun. Best French fries and chicken wings ever (try The Works)!"}
{"text":"JT's has the best chicken wings!!!  The \"everything \" wings are great, but the \"hot\" wings all drums are too dang good to pass up.  I'm sure all flavors are great.  The wings are tossed in sauce, fried, and finished on the grill. Each order is made fresh in the small kitchen which is visible from the bar. The main two chefs at JT's are absolutely amazing.  They are quick, efficient, clean, and crank out delicious bar food.  JT's is easy to miss and can get very full, especially during big games.  It's definitely predominantly an Arcadia crowd, but there's a good mix of people that frequent JTs and All of the bartenders are great."}
{"text":"Local hidden gem. I snapped some pics to share with my OU friends and they were definitely happy. Small place but packed on a weeknight. Two tv's to watch whatever's on.  No frills service. Good bar food. I'll admit I didn't find the wings to match their hype here, but I'd order them again if/when I come back. They have daily specials for you to save a few bucks."}
{"text":"Blown away by JT's on many levels.  

Went for the wings based on many yelp* reviews, but got much more.  The wings lived up to the hype.  My bro-in-law, his wife, and I ordered a bucket of 50 with \"the works.\"  Best value on the menu for $25.  The wings had great flavor, taste, and their best feature is being deep fried.  I loved being able to see them cooked right in front of us also.

JT's itself is cramped, steamy, and as dive-ish as it gets.  But that's what's most appealing.  The staff was awesome and extremely personable.  You walk in and immediately they size you up as a newbie.  We were given a few \"welcome to JT's\" benefits and made good conversation with the barkeep.  

No matter where you hail from in the Valley, JT's is a must!"}
{"text":"The square footage of this place is about the same as my credit score. But I am not opposed to a cozy, dive bar on the Phoenix/Scottsdale border. This place actually reminded me of bars in San Fran the way it is long and narrow. This place had a good vibe and crowd (ages ranging from early 20's to mid 50's). 
The grilled wings were pretty delicious and the drinks were definitely reasonable. My tab was around $50 after 2 dozen wings, 3 draft beers, 2 chick drinks, and a pair of Jameson shots. 
The owner of the joint (and I know he was the owner because he was helping himself to drinks behind the bar) walks around and glad-hands the regulars while swapping tales of past and soon-to-be glories of Sooner football.
I have never even set foot in the great state of Oklahoma but after a few drinks at this bar, it will have you whooping \"Boomer Sooner\" with the rest of the regulars. Whatever-the-fuck that means."}
{"text":"My husband and I spent the day hiking so we were starved and in need of late lunch. I had a crazy craving for grilled chicken and green chili sammie. We love local businesses and avoid chains at all costs. Trusty Yelp led us to JTs for the closest thing to what I wanted.  But it was a Google review that really intrigued us \"JTs had dope ass wings\" lol.  It's true! Their wings are The Best in the Valley!!!  
Our server, thinking he might have been an owner, forgot to put in the order for our wings so offered to buy ours, on the house, sweet! We ordered Hot which was the perfect amount of heat for us. Then he gave us a sample of The Works, a blend of Teriyaki, Honey and BBQ sauce. I think? Whatever it was...so delicious. 
This little joint really is the friendliest dive bar. Excellent service, fun atmosphere, and \"dope ass\" wings  
We will be back."}
{"text":"This is literally the best bar I've been to in Phoenix. It's a small neighborhood dive bar. We started out with jalapeño poppers which were delicious. Top notch. We then had the double dipped \"works\" grilled wings. I consider myself a wing connoisseur and these were the best I've ever had! Also, even though it's a dive bar they have the nicest restrooms I've ever seen and I'm a bit of toilet connoisseur if I do say so myself..... The bartender did a great job. She handled the whole bar by herself."}
{"text":"For a \"dive\" bar, this place is where its at. It's the perfect amount of sleazy and classy. The food is fantastic, the drinks are cheap, and the atmosphere is exactly what a dive bar should be. 

The food was cheap and delicious. They had a surprising amount of vegetarian or easily modifiable to be vegetarian options on the late night menu. 

They only have one type of red wine and it comes in a 2 glass airplane bottle. Be careful - these can sneak up on you quickly. I'd recommend sticking to hard liquor or beer instead. 

Great place for a night out on the town! I don't recommend bringing in a big group unless you call ahead and ask if they have room. It's a very small and narrow place."}
{"text":"While I was totally blown away by how perfectly crispy, spicy, fresh and amazing their wings were, it's one of those places where if you're not a regular they all sort of look at you like you don't belong, which is sort of off putting. 

It's tiny, it's not a good place if you really want to sit down and eat and it kinda sucks having to work your way through the crowds to order food and, again, I feel like if they don't know you they don't pay as much attention to you.  Like, when you walk in they all look at you like maybe you have AIDS (and maybe you do man but so what).

I've only been here once so maybe it's odd to write a review BUT man, the wings, seriously, top notch some of the best I've had in the valley.  Great flavor, cooked really god damn well and served perfectly crispy.  I would come back strictly for the wings despite my overall discomfort there.  But then, I'm on anti-anxiety meds and hate crowds so I'm probably mostly just retarded."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Arcadia dive bar & they have the BEST wings in town! They can't be beat, I promise {Other local restaurants have tried to copy their ways and can't compare!} It's full of Arcadia locals and the best place to visit on a Saturday afternoon to watch sports, grab an ice cold beer and devour wings with great company! {People are always picking up to-go orders of wings, they're THAT good!} If you're a wing addict like me, you MUST go! {When I'm feeling healthy, I'll order a grilled chicken salad and have them toss the chicken in buffalo sauce!} Their ranch is also aaaamazing!"}
{"text":"Ok, so filled in the blanks and JT is out of the picture but his legacy lives on.  This place is as popular as ever but we usually manage to find a spot.  Today's review is for the cook who deserves a bonus and a nice long all expense paid vacation...I've never seen someone who can knock out a couple hundred wings, burgers, tacos, and fries in a cooking area that's smaller than you would find in a mobile home and all in the time span of the two beers I had....he didn't even break a sweat."}
{"text":"Best tucked away spot in Arcadia. I go there for the friendly bartenders, cool crowd and best wings in PHX. You need to order \"The Works\" wings (secret menu) Julio is the cook and he does a great job! You will find JT sitting at the bar usualyy drinking with the patrons. There's a juke box and great daily specials such as: 2 for 1 burgers on Tuesdays. A can't miss spot."}
{"text":"My fave Arcadia neighborhood bar! Great food, wings are bomb and service is amazing!!!!  Love that you can pick your own music as well....bonus!!!"}
{"text":"JT, JT, JT....OMG...the wings will make you take flight. They are the most delicious little mouth delights. Serious ..dude should have a solid gold chicken wing out front. They are grilled to perfection, the degree of heat or flavor is right everytime. The bar is fun, fun, fun! The regulars may look you over a time or two..but hey I'm good lookin so I don't mind. lol. The tacos rock out Thursday night.  The only problem with JT's is, he's not open on Sunday for football..and that pisses me off every time I remember on hangover Sunday, that I forgot to get them on Saturday. Damnit, I hate that I have to go there twice a week.  Cuz he is open for Monday night football..oh ya.....screw  it..I'm going right now...c ya..."}
{"text":"Great bar in the Arcadia neighborhood! Come here to catch up with friends and watch any game. The wings and french fries are a must try!"}
{"text":"Excellent service & the wings are best I ever had. It's going to be difficult to try something new on the menu."}
{"text":"So my good friend, the pilot calls and says, \"Kimberly, can your yuppy ass hang at a dive bar?\" and Im like, \" Bring all the dive you got baby...\", of course, hes about as preppie as they come... and we end up at JT's... OSU banners adorn the place... its long and narrow.. and we got the once or twice over as we walked in... the bar tender, Rebecca was sweet and informative... The place is simple... and cheap... and packed... The wings seemed to be the thing... and Im wishing I had a taste for them... just never have been a fan. But they looked good... My friend had a burger... it was piled high with mushrooms.. I had a grilled chicken sandwiche...basic, but I needed food if I was drinking with a pilot, after all... 2 Guiness, 4 Harp, 2 shots and 2 burgers... and the bill was about $45, thats a pretty good thing..."}
{"text":"This is a fun bar with a really cool, chill atmosphere! Very glad we tried it out, food smells good, drinks are good!"}
{"text":"Just got back from JT'S for the second time in 3 days, they've earned a loyal customer for sure. For starters, the wings are out of this world and the atmosphere is lively. The other reason that made me a believer was the professionalism and kindness of the owner. This place is a must go if you appreciate great bar food, drinks, and a great atmosphere. 5 stars. 
-The newest JT'S regular"}
{"text":"First, don't be alarmed by the cramped space, dingy surroudings and Arcadia townie vibe. It's a a great dive bar with fabulous wings. The burgers are great, too, along with other daily specials. It can be a little Arcadia 'clique-y' and you won't get much sports watching here given the tight space. It is a good place for Oklahoma football games, though, despite the cramped quarters. It's our mainstay for food, drinks and friendly people."}
{"text":"Great little dive bar. Strong, cheap drinks and the best wings in town :)"}
{"text":"Ahhhmazing wings.  Go on Mondays for wing special; $6.  I've only been once, but I am craving the wings as I type this."}
{"text":"Great hot wings, tasty cheeseburgers, and awesome bartenders. New TV's to watch football all day. Definitely worth the drive here if it is out of your way just for their famous wings. Will not be disappointed. Small bars with character does not not get any better. Someone you meet in this first 30 minutes will most likely buy you a shot or beer. It's that kind of friendly vibe."}
{"text":"More of a \"bar WITH a grill\" than a \"bar & grill\", but still a great place to get some food. Kind of dive-y. Parking is difficult."}
{"text":"What a great Yelp find.  I was looking for someplace new to try for wings, and Yelp recommended this place.  After reading the reviews, I decided to give it a try.  Wow!!  The works wings are absolutely amazing.  The prices are great and the entire staff was friendly.  I was there on Saturday afternoon, and the TV's were full of college football.  What better way to spend the afternoon than with great wings, cold beer, football, and good people."}
{"text":"The best chicken wings I have ever had. I crave these wings! Very friendly staff, during games can be crowded but that's because it's so fun!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Been going here since high school. A great neighborhood join with awesome food. Highly suggest checking it out. Also it's an awesome place during the holiday season. If you live in the Arcadia neighborhood and haven't been, it's a must-try place."}
{"text":"Awesome little spot! Stopped by on our way home after seeing the good reviews! Definitely will comeback if we are in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"This is such a fun little spot!!  The wings are the best ever! The employees always make it a really enjoyable experience and so much fun. It almost feels like you know everyone in the place. My fave spot in the area for sure!"}
{"text":"Got charged 3 times one card and have to wait 2 days to get my money back. I understand how the banks work but come on.....$135 for 10 shots of fireball. Ridiculous. First time there and probably last time there"}
{"text":"I ordered these wings three times just to make sure before I made a comment. The works wings, crispy are the best wings I've ever had anywhere. Absolute perfection....finished on the grill the way a wing should be."}
{"text":"I got friends in low places
At JT's Bar where the whiskey are downed
And beer chances my blues away
And I'll be okay

Well, I'm not big on chicken wings
Think I'll give them a try with hot sauce
Oh I got friends 
At JT's Bar & Grill!
(Lyrics - Garth Brooks - Low Places)

I can't say I'm a regular here, but this is definitely my dive.  The place reminds me of home back in Iowa.  Low, dark, and dink with some crazy-#$% flares hanging around, and I'm not talking about the stuff on the walls - wink!  I've been here enough and it's weird to say I've never really ate here until I saw it was 2012 Best of Phoenix Bar Food! Shawa!?  Sweet and awesome article so my friends I gotta try.  

I ordered their wings after watching how the cook made them.  Fried tossed in sauce and then grilled.  Never saw it done like so, but I'm not a fan of soggy wings.  I always order on the side, but the bartender convinced me to go with \"the works\", and keep it as is.  I'm not a sucker for pretty bartenders, but how can I say no.....ooooh shucks sure!  I did not regret the decision - no foo, not the \"Lebron Decision\", I'm talking about the wings!  Okay let's stay focused.  The wings came with a perfect texture of crispiness with a jolt of sweet and spicy sauce.  Bam!  Best damn sauced wings I had!  Thanks for the recommendation!  I ordered a side of fries to keep that spicy to balance the spice.  

Along with your food you must order a few drinks here.  Not the largest selection in town, but if you need that go to the Yard House ya hippy!  My AA (Affordable Alcohol) group would love it here.  In my opinion the drinks are pretty cheap considered the prices of most places these days.  

Overall, great bar to lay low if that's how you feel for the night.  It's right in the heart of the Arcadia neighborhood and it's not as rough as it looks from the outside.  I'm from Iowa and I've seen some rough bars and this place looks the spot, but once you start meeting the people around having a drink.  You'll feel just at home - a Midwest home that is....- Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Had the wings 5*. Went today for a cheeseburger and was great burger!!! Love watching someone else cook me a meal, and serving it to with a smile :-) definitely will be back soon!!!!!"}
{"text":"Best wings in Phoenix. That's all you need to know. Don't try calling in as they never answer, but I can appreciate that. Go in, order your wings and have a beer while you wait. The works is the most popular, but if you're concerned with spice, don't be. I'm a huge fan of the spicy honey bbq. There is a typo on the menu that says \"spicy, honey bbq\" that leads you to believe they are two different things....they're not and they are hot - hotter than the works."}
{"text":"One word... WINGS. The best wings I've ever had hands down in my life.. go for 1/2 works, 1/2 hot. They are unreal. Also, I knew I would love this place from the moment I walked in and my beer was as frosty ice cold as it gets. Total dive bar but love love LOVE this place. Their burgers and grilled chicken sandwiches are bomb too. Def don't bring kids though- not a kid friendly place at all."}
{"text":"Delectable and crispy wings, just on the good side of too salty. Try not to be put off by \"chicken feet\" on the menu; they aren't feet but rather... the most delicious and moist chicken tenders EVER (one-upped with homemade ranch dressing). We walked in just looking for a chill spot to watch some Olympiad action and were so pleasantly surprised. Friendly, divey, delicious. Loved it."}
{"text":"I was introduced to this bar by an old landlord in arcadia. at the time i was not a buffalo wings kinda guy but that has all changed. this place has set the bar for wings in phx for me. fried, sauced and then grilled. weeknight special $5 for a dozen wings. Bad part: not open on football sundays."}
{"text":"Best wings in Phoenix. 
It is better in the winter than the summer. Great music player on wall."}
{"text":"Jt's is a fantastic neighborhood bar. Full disclosure: I'm a regular there. This is not a fine dining establishment, but the wings are the best in town, and the rest of the nightly specials are definitely worth trying. Go in and check it out, but leave your attitude outside..we are all friends at Jt's and you will be welcomed by all. Oh, and the drinks are strong and the bartenders are awesome. Tip: don't order a frozen drink. It's not the place for it, and I don't think there is even a blender anyway. Try Applebee's instead."}
{"text":"JT's effin rocks.  All the food is very good, great tasting bar food at it's best but the thing you have to get is the wings.  These are the best wings in town, bar none!  They are flavorful and addictive!"}
{"text":"I love JT's. The food is outstanding. The wings  are uber alles. That guy Omar hates your guts. He hates my guts too. He hates everyone's guts. It's part of the charm.

Go there, but don't take my fucking seat. I'm hungry."}
{"text":"This place has a really great laid back vibe to it. I've had lots of wings in my life from lots of different places and hands down this place has the best wings on the planet. If you like wings, you need to come here. Really cool/friendly staff too."}
{"text":"My favorite local bar, hands down, for the past going on 15 years now. JT's is the diary I don't keep (for good reason). I can always go in and pour my heart out to one of the girls while they pour me a Jack and Coke. Best chicken wings on the planet too. And John Taylor's like family to me. Make sure you pop in when Beth is behind the counter. She's a doll and a good listener! I don't have enough love in my heart for this fine establishment.

Oh yeah, and if you can't deal with true dive bar bathrooms, do not go here! Just part of the John Taylor charm, if you ask me!"}
{"text":"My first visit...  was very pleasantly surprised.   Small, crowded and noisy as you'd expect for a popular neighborhood hangout filled with happy people chowing down on wings and drinks.   Wings aren't my thing so I had the Tuesday cheeseburger special which was about as good as cheeseburgers get.  Not sure about the onion rings -- couldn't tell if they were made fresh or from a frozen bag,   I continue my search for Tony Roma's onion rings....   but I digress.  This place has great food and service and we will be back."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday, it's a small neighborhood place, but that's OK. I read their reviews before I went and it sounded like a good place to get wings, which I was craving. I met up with my Son and Daughter-in-law there around 6:30 PM, luckily there was one table left. We got waited on right away. We ordered the wings as an appetizer, we ordered medium and they were HOT, but very, very good, best I've had in a long time. I got the chicken cheese crisp and my son and daughter-in-law ordered burgers, we all were happy with our meal. Prices are reasonable. They were busy but always had someone coming by to see if we were doing OK.
I'm for sure going back sometime. The wings were the bomb."}
{"text":"Wings were OK. Liked the Yella Pilsner draft special. Decent dive bar. Real good ranch!"}
{"text":"It's a solid local joint. I was there on a Wednesday evening and seemed to be the only person who wasn't a regular. Service was alright. Nothing to rave about but not terrible either. Will visit for another round of their suicide wings."}
{"text":"Classic dive bar in the east coast sense of the term.  Not many left in the world.  If you like wings than you have to stop by at least for a taste and the rest of the standard bar food is rotated as daily specials and are very generous and filling (especially steak night!).  Lots of regulars who appear to be very welcoming and deferential to newcomers (i.e., giving up bar stools or tables when needed).  Always say Hi to Julio at the grill - he's been there as bartenders have come and gone; then there's always JT himself (DUH!)"}
{"text":"The wings are absolutely amazing. They made me feel like carnivore. Yum! Tacos are also very good. People are nice and friendly. Service is on point. So far I'm in love."}
{"text":"End of the year so here's an idea for a New Years resolution!  Get to JTs, order the wings, have a great drink and enjoy the best neighborhood sports bar in town!!"}
{"text":"The epitome of dive bar!!!  
I have never been here and not had a good time!  
The bartenders are awesome, the drinks are strong, the food is delicious and you'll end your night with a shockingly cheap tab!"}
{"text":"You get exactly what you are looking for in this dive-y pseudo country western bar. Best wing in the valley and in an awesome part of town. High accessibility with lots surrounding you in terms of nature/bars/restaurants. Unlike anything else around it."}
{"text":"Another day of wing quest...and I have to say, this little \"divey\" bar is a gem. You will miss it if you drive too fast, the bar itself has little in the way of signage. They do have a street-side sign that you can navigate by. The décor is, well \"tchotchkes\" hanging from the ceiling. Think \"Shoefiti\" meets grandma's garage sale...

Doesn't change the fact that they have $5 mini pitchers and awesome wings in various flavors, soaked and then grilled to perfection. I don't mind looking at shrunken heads hanging from the rafters when I am biting into wing heaven. Service was personable and quick."}
{"text":"Jt's Bar & Grill is exactly what I have been looking for in the Valley! Neighborhood dive bar where everyone seemed to know each other, insanely friendly service (shout out to Kerri!) and killer bar food and chicken wings of epic proportions! 
I am a chicken wing connoisseur, and frankly Jt's may have the best chicken wings I have EVER had! They deep fry those baby's, sauce em and throw them on the grill. They have several choices of sauces the best was the works which featured all of their sauces mixed together minus their suicide sauce which produced a delicious and not too spicy wing! I like my wings ultra spicy so I ordered a side of the Suicide sauce, which I personally loved - definitely spicy but not so that your mouth is on fire. Their wings will set you back $7.50 for a dozen ( Which makes me love this place more!). 
They have a pretty large beer selection on tap and every liquor you would want! This place is def going to be apart of my repertoire and it should be for you too!"}
{"text":"The famous wings are absolutely amazing. The Works sauce is soooo good and the wings are crispy. Best wings I've ever had, hands down."}
{"text":"Spent some time here waiting for my knives to be sharpened next door. The beer was cold, the (famous) wings looked and smelled amazing and the bartender was super personable. There were a few TVs tuned to the sports. It has an odd little patio outside with a couple of tables, but multiple signs telling you not to bring your drinks outside. 

It is definitely a locals hang-out with the guy sitting next to me at the bar trying to remember the name of an Arcadia nightclub from 1990 which \"used to be great until it turned a bit knifey\" The bartender and the local struggled with the name. I was of no help. I Googled \"knifey Arcadia nightclub\" without success. I left before they could get it, so I don't know if they ever figured it out. If, by chance you do know the answer, please stop in here and tell them - they are probably still trying to remember."}
{"text":"Great, cozy little dive ! Best wings in town ?! Top ten for sure ! The hours seem to be a little wonky but that's ok"}
{"text":"I've long heard about the legendary JT's and how their wings are some of the best in Phoenix (if not THE best), however, I had yet to make my way to this \"hole-in-the-wall\" establishment. Yesterday that all changed when my co-workers headed there for a small happy hour and I was able to experience it for myself.

Usually, when people talk something up, you're a little disappointed when you experience it for yourself, but that could not be further from the truth! The hype about JT's wings is real. There are the best wings I've  ever had, especially the spicy buffalo dry rub. 

This will be my new go-to wing spot, and if you like a stiff pour, JT's is definitely the spot for you!"}
{"text":"Probably the best wings I've ever had. They're crispy and slightly barbeque charred on the outside (not messy or greasy at all) but still moist and juicy on the inside and packed with tons of flavor. Great hole in the wall spot with lots of character. Type of place common in older east coast cities, very uncommon in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Tiny hole in the wall. Came on a Thursday  after work with four co workers and it was packed. Lucky we got stools at the bar. Very friendly relaxed and neighborhood atmosphere.  

I guess it was taco Thursday. Tacos 1$. The best thing about the tacos besides the price is the homemade salsa. Hands downs best salsa you'll find

I ordered the wings. A dozen for 8$. Bartender said they were meaty. Fried then grilled. You'll wait but it's worth it. I got Suicide flavor. It's suppose to be the hottest but I've had hotter.   Still very good but not any meatier than normal

Fried mushrooms were good. I would try anything on their menu which is not too big. Basic bar food that's cooked on a grill behind the bar by Julio, who is also the creator of the amazing salsa

I give five stars for the atmosphere and extremely friendly staff who clearly appear to enjoy their job and the down to earth people who know about this small bar."}
{"text":"Dive bar heaven! Loved this little gem. Their is a jukebox so you can play your own tunes. The drinks are cheap. The patrons are hilarious. The vibe is awesome and reminds me of little beer joints back east. Go. Drink. Be merry!"}
{"text":"Came into Phoenix for training and immediately did a search for the best place for wings and this place was listed as #2.... I believe it should have been #1..the wings were very very good!!! I asked for them to be crispy and they were perfect!!! I got medium as the waitress/bartender said that the sauces run a little hot... My friends ordered the chicken tacos and they were impressed... 
My only criticisms would be that they didn't have moscato wine, the place is rather small and the service was a little slow but this is understandable because it was packed...the music was also very good.."}
{"text":"It's a smaller hole in the wall kind of place. But for this stretch of Indian School it's a great easy going kinda spot."}
{"text":"The BOMB, arguably the best wings in Phoenix. Jana and Julio have it on lock down.
The place is tiny but the food is BOSS. Worth the drive from anywhere in town."}
{"text":"Best bar in Arcadia.

Best wings I have ever tasted.

Worst bathrooms in the Valley.

Arcadia, I miss you."}
{"text":"Their wings were so good! I don't think I'll get wings any other place. It's a nice dive bar and the staff is great. Its small and narrow, which gives you a chance to be friendly."}
{"text":"Out of this world wings! They grill the wings after they're fried and sauced, giving an extra smokey flavor. Not huge wings, but meaty enough that a dozen will likely fill you up. We enjoyed the spicy honey BBQ and the works (kind of a mashup of other sauces, flavorful without being too hot). The place is small and seems to be frequented by locals. No frills, but great food."}
{"text":"I've lived in the same area for 3 years and this place has never came up on yelp. Yelp, you need some serious upgrades because this place should be on the top of everyone's list. 

The bartenders: 5 starts - welcoming, nice, and great service. I would sit at the bar just to make sure I had the attention from the bartenders because it was great.

The food/beer: 5 starts. Amazing wings if you haven't noticed already. Seriously the wings are over the moon good. The burger was great and so were the jalapeño poppers. Next time, I'm trying the nachos. 

The price: 5 stars. We ordered a pitcher of beer, cheeseburger, jalapeño poppers and wings for $45!!! Yes please!!! 

The atmosphere: 4 stars. This place feels like home, somewhere you can easily become a regular at. My only complaint is seating. Thankfully we found bar seats or else we would have been screwed."}
{"text":"Best down home, home grown dive bar ever.. The beer is ICE COLD and the wings are THE BEST in this town....Jenny is a fantastic bartender and makes you feel like family from the minute you walk in until you crawl out the door!"}
{"text":"I ordered the works wings, double dipped. They have a barbeque and sweet teriyaki taste, the grill marks are a nice touch. I received a mix of small and meaty wings. They aren't my favorite wings, I prefer a more crispy outside and I like a lot of heat. These wings are drenched in sauce when double dipped, and dry when not. Reasonably priced although 2 times was enough for me, I won't return. The search for an excellent wing place continues, so far Rosie Mccaffrey's is my favorite."}
{"text":"Had awesome service and food.!!Definitely worth the stop  The works chicken wings rock!!"}
{"text":"This is first and foremost a neighborhood DIVE BAR. However, it is a dive bar with old school charm, style, and personality. The food here is shockingly good. The wings I ordered were fantastic - they grill them AFTER they apply the hot sauce to impart a less slimy texture. I sat at the bar and watched burger after delicious burger roll off the grill - I will be trying one of those on my next visit. Downside: it was warm, and the bathroom needs serious help! 

Note: It gets really packed around dinner time and the service can be slow - so take a deep breath, relax, and they will get to you in good time... I really enjoyed the change of pace."}
{"text":"Hands down best wings in town. People that work there are great. Great patrons. Very welcoming. You may have to wait and it may be crowded but that's because it is so amazing. If you have a problem with JT's it's not them it's YOU! Go here if you have a chance!"}
{"text":"Your classic hole in the wall bar. Nice people and fantastic wings. Good pricing on drinks too. Worth a visit for sure"}
{"text":"Best wings in the valley PERIOD. The works is a great combo flavor but I prefer the hot ones a little more. This is a hidden gem in terms of location but make no mistake their reputation has travelled far. Get their early to grab a seat, it's so worth it. Service is always great, drinks are always cold, and the food (small menu but everything is delicious) is always on point."}
{"text":"Dive Bar feel with excellent service and food! Walked in for the first time and immediately felt welcomed. Took home suicide wings for my son who gave them a 2. Will return for sure!"}
{"text":"We used to close this place down (regularly).  Love JT's!  Great tiny little watering hole where the \"regulars\" constantly occupy their favorite barstools.   Is that old codger still renting a party bus to the Jimmy Buffett concert every year?  Oh & their wings are the BEST! One of the few places in town that you can order them fried, grilled, or BOTH!   Miss seeing all of you peeps!"}
{"text":"Some nights you workout and eat at Flower Child for dinner, other nights you want beer and wings and to kick it back in divey a bar. For those latter nights, this is your spot. 

I had read about this spot awhile back and after a coworker mentioned JTs recently, I decided to needed to definitely check this place out! 

I love that this place is a \"divey\" bar but also a spot where you would never run into any questionable characters. It is situated on the border of Scottsdale and Arcadia and is a hidden gem in an otherwise more upscale area. 

It's definitely quite intimate inside.. Imagine a typical McDonalds and split it in half, that would be about the size of JTs. There are lots of regulars, I'm positive the owner who seated us knew that it was our first time. We came at the peak of the dinner rush and witnessed a few take out orders, you can tell they have quite the reputation in the area. 

My fiancé and I absolutely loved the food. We ordered mild wings, French fries to share, and then I went with a grilled cheese and he got a grilled chicken sandwich. 

The wings are SO YUMMY! Because they're grilled after being fried and sauced, there's this wonderful crispiness to the wings, not to mention the added char from the grill that makes for some excellent flavors. 

The only drawback was the amount of time we waited for our food which was probably about 45-60 minutes. The waiter apologized and let us know that a ton of take out orders were put in right before we arrived but it does make me leery about going back during dinner and receiving a timely meal. Regardless we will return but maybe at a less peak time, I'm already craving some of those amazing wings!"}
{"text":"JT's is seriously the best! The food is awesome, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu! I can't say enough nice things about the friendly and attentive bartenders! We will continue to come here for the great food, exceptional service and fun atmosphere! 
Bonus- they have very clean and nice bathrooms!"}
{"text":"You won't find better wings anywhere else in Arizona. It's that simple. If you're looking for atmosphere, JT's is as dive as you'll find in the Arcadia area. But the wings trump ambience any day. Staff is super friendly (used to give free shots of Fireball whenever ASU scores a TD). Place can get packed on college football Saturdays. But again: it all comes down to the wings. I drive up from Gilbert just for the wings. And now that JT's is on Door Dash, wings delivered at home."}
{"text":"JT's receives a lot of praise for their buffalo wings and it is well deserved. We trekked over from old town on our bikes. JT's is easy to get to from the canal. After sitting down at a table we were greeted by the friendly staff. Beers arrived quickly and an order of 12 medium wings were out shortly after. Fried, sauced, and grilled - these wings were awesome - juicy, crispy, and mmm cayenne spicy (adjectives abound!). JT's is a dive bar of the highest quality. We will make this trek again soon!"}
{"text":"Favorite wing spot in Phoenix!  Thanks to my good friend Robbi G. who turned me onto this place."}
{"text":"This review is for drinks only! I went here last night with a party of 8 people for a birthday party. The place is cute and supposedly has awesome food...but their kitchen was closed! Lame! Anyway, we all had birthday cake shots and I know everyone really liked them....but I thought they tasted a bit like cough syrup. I do really want to try this place again, especially for the food, but for the shots alone, I would say it's just ok."}
{"text":"Amazing wings it's a perfect combination of taste and dive I always feel like I'm in Philly when I come here you have to try the works on the wings it's the best sauce ever and they have the best ranch I've ever tasted this place rocks"}
{"text":"JT's has been around for decades.  The wings are the best in town, and they have daily food specials (except F, S, S) and their well bourbon is Jim Beam.  On Wednesdays, you can get a 16 oz strip or an 8 oz filet  with baked potato and salad for 15 bucks--add a $4.50 cent Jim Beam and Coke, and you've eaten like a Monarch for 20 dollars.  Seriously?  Fantastic.  Can't handle that?  Thursday is 95 cent taco night.  Biggest problem here is that JT's is TINY, and their good food and booze is no secret.  Parking and a place to sit are going to be your biggest problem.  Come early and stay late-that will cure the issue."}
{"text":"My friends took it to heart when I poked fun at Randy's propensity toward the new and shiny in regards to his taste in bars and restaurants. Randy thus tagged my weekend visit \"Danimal's Tour de Dive 2017.\"  I make no apologies. I just prefer places for eating, and especially drinking, with a little more character than your typical places in OC and Scottsdale/Phoenix. 

We hit up additional bars after dinner on a recent Saturday night: Dilly Dally Lounge, and The Little Woody. JT''s was bar far the best of the lot, with The Little Woody a close 2nd. JT's was clean and tidy with a bit of a more mature crowd, and a professional btender lady. Drinks were very reasonable and Yvonne, our local tour guide, stated that the food is above average for bar food.

This would probably be \"my\" watering hole if I lived nearby. 

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Okay, the only reason I went here was because when I searched Yelp for wings they were the closest  place. Once I saw that everyone said they had good wings I had to try them. Plus I was craving for wings, and Honey Bears (which is way closer) only sells wings on Mondays. For some reason on Mondays I never want wings. 

So anyway, I placed my order over the phone, and when I got there they already boxed up and ready.  The picture made me think the wings were bigger. They looked so little in the big togo box, which could have been half the size to fit 12. The order of a dozen cost $7.50. I thought that was a good price thinking the wings were way bigger. So I was disappointed for about 30 seconds till I had my first bite. The wings were DELISH!!! It was worth every penny.

This place a small bar with very little walking space. I can only imagine if I came during happy hour or when a big game was on. I would give them 3.5 stars, but the wings really help. If nothing else come for the wings. They are Awesome!"}
{"text":"Being originally from Buffalo area, I'd have to say that I'm extremely happy to have found this bar.  The wings here bring me back to the delicious wings that I'm used to! They deep fry em, sauce em, grill em & then sauce em again (2nd saucing upon request) ... I highly recommend trying out \"the works\" .. They mix all of the sauces together (except for the really spicy ones) - Just DeLiSh!!! 

Service is always on point and extremely friendly. The only negative to this place is that it took me over 3 years to find it!! My TOP recommendation for tasty wings in the valley."}
{"text":"Only been a handful of times but the spots always packed but a very chill crowd.... Good mix of golfing Arcadia regulars and twenty something crowd. I come for the wings and burgers.... I'm sure it's a fun spot on weekend night but haven't made it yet for one. Drinks are average prices and bar staff are quick.... The grill is right next to the bar and they've had the same crew for a while... All good signs to me... Give it a chance if you're in the neighborhood and not feeling jam packed patio vibe of oh so.... Or take a stop at  both"}
{"text":"Don't get me started on the wings, AMAZING!! Good times, good music. Nice little hole in the wall"}
{"text":"\"Tongue in Cheek\" review to follow. 

What a dive bar but oh so much fun. I loved the bar tender. \"Aloha\"  Barender Gal moving to Hawaii. ( take me with you) You put up with two loud birthday gals and a large bunch of drunk woman walking into your very small, neighborhood bar at midnight. Every head turned when we walked in. It is a pretty small place. teehee! (Just an FYI, not all of us were drunk, but maybe we were, Hmmmmmmmmm??? Insert pinkie to the side of the mouth style) 

Just kidding. We had a blast and the place is such a typical neighborhood Divey Bar. Check it out. Not sure the prices since the man next to us was buying all the drinks and I was the DD."}
