{"text":"In full disclosure when this establishment first opened I did have really good food. What I had tonight as far as takeout was completely unacceptable. As someone who's been in the food service industry for 20+ years I understand that A take out customers is not your highest priority because you're not going to make a large amount of tips off them. However, based on the pictures I posted that you can check my wings were not only a full six like I ordered but five with one massive fully connected wing (correction, there was a sixth wing hiding under their big wing), and completely underseasoned and sauced. To be honest basically they were fried wings sections with a little bit of marinade on them and nothing else...... Very disappointing especially considering that the bar manager said that their wings were one of their best items. I also got the Sicilian because I love the Roman burger that Mr. hero has, even though it is in all honesty a disgusting delight to allow yourself once in a while, it's still good! What I got was over cooked ground beef with stale salami stale bread and really overall just sadness on a bun. I know this review seems kind of harsh, however I just want to be honest so that hopefully the management and crew can do something about it! I've been to many Pannini's before and usually they are Great! This one however is missing the mark! Sorry guys I don't mean to be rude but I just want to let you know what's going on so that you can fix it because I would love to have you guys around in the future! I will be back, because I really do enjoy the franchise! However, I think you need to get yourselves re-organized. And I really hope you do!"}
{"text":"I never have complained publicly about any place before....until now. I don't know if the manager needs to re-evaluate how to do their job or if the entire staff needs to be re-evaluated but I for one will never return to this place. We walked in and a lady is standing behind the register.  She barely made eye contact let alone say anything to us while we stood next to the \"please wait here to be seated sign\". 5 minutes later another lady comes up and seated us. Our server took 10 minutes to ask for our drinks. There was a private party going on so perhaps the wait staff was more focused on that then all the other patrons. Since we had to wait over an hour for our food I had plenty of time observe others to see if they too were experiencing this poor service; unfortunately we were not the only ones. When our food finally arrived both of our fries were well undercooked.  It was noticeable by just looking at them. Obviously no one cared to check it before bringing it out. We arrived at 7:10 and did not leave until 8:40. Pretty unimpressive."}
{"text":"If you like live musicians and alcohol, this place is for you. If you like a nice quiet evening, this place is not for you.  The 3 Maker's Marks I had were excellent. I would have had more but my wife was tired of listening to Disco Inferno and insisted we leave for the night.  I didn't try the food, but it looked good.  I have a feeling this will be a pretty good party spot if you enjoy that kind of thing......"}
{"text":"I try to like this place. Serving are always inconsistent and taste is never the same. I came in today getting something \"I knew I'd like\" for it to be terrible. They open at 11 but didn't unlock until 1130. They're busy which is good to see but they don't care. The kitchen person unlocked the door IN HIS GLOVES! *barf! I will probably still visit and they have great beers. Too bad they can't be properly managed because it would be insanely successful!"}
{"text":"The wings are good. I got their most popular classic buffalo and they were satisfactory. They didn't wow me, though. It was a good atmosphere to watch a game."}
{"text":"The first time we went in there, you could tell it was very new. The food was good and we enjoyed our time. The second time we went, I tried to make a reservation to watch the OSU bowl game. I called a few hours before the game started and they said they normally do not take reservations but since it wasn't so busy, they'd be willing to take a reservation. I told them 8:00 to be in time for the game and they took my name down. We got in there right before then to get our reservation and they said they were very busy because of the game being shown. That's fine but they said they would take a reservation for that time. All they told me was that I could wait around until a table would open up. I don't believe they even apologized for the inconvenience. They didn't say that nor offer anything like a gift card. We didn't want to stay there and give them business after that so we went to TGI Fridays across the street and they were great. They had great service, the food was great and we were able to find a great table right in front of the TV to watch it. The one in Kent and Canton are always great but this one had issues so it might be a little while until I decide to go back."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, very consistent. Weekly specials, half off appetizers. Fresh, clean taps. Children's menu. Very accommodating. Clean bathrooms ( though the water is always cold )  Willoughby panini's has been our go to sports bar for years, we have been here hundreds of times.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"First time visitors have to try one of there famous panini sandwiches. I recomend either the corned beef or the capicola. They have  nice happy hour and game specials, as well as a nice selection of late night items. They also have a great patio bar with a giant movie screan for the tribe games. The pato bar has an removable enclosure for the winter time. Also they have 3 different bars and plenty of seating. The menu has a good selection for everyone as well as kids.plus they always have daily specials during the week. I've never had a bad meal or a bad experience there."}
{"text":"First time here. wanted to try the paninis,guess what? they don't have any.
Went for the wings and pizza.  Wings needed more sauce.  A the pizza tasted like the sauce came right out of the can. Real acidic.
Service was poor. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"In search of a restaurant that was open during Christmas Eve we (a party of 3)  came across this Paninis.  It was around 4 when we arrived and were pleased to see that they were open until 6.  We were even more pleased to see that it was happy hour.  There were half priced appetizers and drink discounts.  (Though I am not sure what the drink discounts were, as I didn't order anything from the bar)  The food was good as was the service.  Though the kitchen was a little slow because it took a bit for our food to come out.  That could be because the restaurant was pretty full.  Either way, I would definitely go back and not just on a Christmas Eve."}
{"text":"Got boneless wings when I didn't ask for them and was utterly shocked to see they hired one of the Kentucky Derby's losing horses as a waiter"}
{"text":"I don't know why you would ever consider yourself a server if you are going to judge your restaurant patrons. The service that my friends, family and I received, was less than sub par! The bar behind the sliding glass is a good experience, but the general service area is a complete joke. Never again will I come here!"}
{"text":"Nice, clean bar - restaurant and family friendly. BUT, I ordered a panini sandwich thinking it would be their specialty. What a disappointment! !The ingredients were fresh, but it was very boring. There w as no flavor and the bread was soft. When I think of a panini sandwich,  I think of a buttery grilled and crispy sour dough bread as the \"main attraction\"!! If were to go back I would definitely not get a panini."}
{"text":"Sat down very quick. Not crowded. Drinks and food came fast. I did not like how my lemonade was powder and tasted too watery."}
{"text":"We went there at 4:30 yesterday-a Saturday.
Got seated and the music was so loud we couldn't talk to each other across the table. The waitress was clueless as far as knowing the menu or answering any questions.
There were 5 of us and 4 of us didn't even finish our meals-the food was that bad. The fries weren't fully cooked and the \"Panini\" sandwiches weren't even grilled-which is what a Panini is. We asked the waitress and she said that's they way that they do their Paninis. What a joke! The Italian paninis had one slice of salami, one slice of capiciola and one slice of ham. There was nothing to the sandwiches!
Total rip off. Their cole slaw sucked too.
The one person that got a reuben said that it was good-and they grilled that one!
No idea how or why they are even in business!!!"}
{"text":"I live there wings. I don't do yelp because every negative comment is a bunch of bitches. Good food. And good bartenders."}
{"text":"First off the wings were not all the way cooked they were still bleeding. So I took them back and the manager tries to convince me that it was a \"vein\"and is still good . I've never had a vein in any other wing that I've ate before.. And also there other batch didn't have any sauce!!! Definitely never ever coming back to this place very disappointed"}
{"text":"My friends and I frequent the Willoughby Panini's at least 3x a month.  Nothing but great service and even better food.  In the summer, nothing beats a bucket of beers on their tiki inspired patio after a day of boating.  

Their chips should be sold in stores.
You can't go wrong with an Overstuffed Sandwich.
The Buffalo Crunch Wrap is the bomb diggity.
Wing sauce of choice: 'Brickhouse'."}
{"text":"Mediocre bar food. The food quality leaves a lot to be desired, especially when the restaurant is busy. During my last visit, we waited about 25 minutes for a table. My burger was so greasy/soggy, the bun was a total mess before it even arrived to my table. Gross. 

It is a decent bar but a lackluster restaurant."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place better than I did.  Its relatively new, spacious and nicely decorated.  They spent some money to build this place, cleary.  With a name like Panini's, I was expecting an emphasis on food...of some sort.  When I walked through the door it wasn't delicious smells that assaulted the senses, it was the awful music.  The exterior says 2015 but the music says 1977.

I asked my waitress for the house specialty....well, the panini's of course she said.  You can choose two things to put in the sandwich...cheese steak, turkey, etc.  The picture shows french fries are stuffed inside this \"pannini\".  I said what the heck, give me the cheese steak and hard salami option.  Keep the fries inside...we'll give that a shot.  Sigh.

About four and half minutes later (wow, that was fast!) I got this sandwich that looked like something I make at home with ingredients from Kroger.  White french bread (pre-sliced) and re-heated cheese-steak? meat and some coleslaw (the kind you buy in a bag at Kroger).  None of it had any flavor at all.  Except the hard salami.  I swear it was the Kroger brand....which was awesome because I do like that on crackers and have some in refrigerator right now.  However this sandwich....wow....just no.

My expectations are now properly re-set.   Expect mid, to low-level bar food.

Skip the panini's."}
{"text":"Panini's is your typical bar and grille. The food is good, the beers are the same as every other restaurant, and the service is average. It's not terrible, but it's nothing to write home about. It's just Panini's. The Steele's Corner location does have a nice patio though, which is great for watching sports games. In the winter, they can even close the garage doors on part of the patio as well, which is also nice. I went here with my parents the other day and ordered a few appetizers while we watched the Tribe play. The server was good for as busy as they were, and we sat outside on the patio. We got some bar food and a few beers. I'll always come back to Panini's if I am just looking for a place to have a casual beer and some mozzarella sticks for a game."}
{"text":"Came in on New Year's Eve for lunch with my daughter.  Got seated immediately and had a server in no time.  I really had wanted to go for Mexican food, but the daughter choose here, so I had to have a margarita.  Asked if they had any 'special' or 'jazzed up' margaritas, no, so I asked for their house with an extra shot of Cuervo 1800 in it.  My daughter got a fuzzy navel (never had it before) which brought back memories for me from 30 years ago.

We ordered the buffalo chicken wrap with fries and the Hot Sicilian (2 hamburgers with grill pastrami, lettuce, tomato onion cheese on a grilled hoagie roll with Italian dressing on the side) with a side of onion rings.  The sandwiches were good, but the fries were cold and the onion rings something they bought from GFS, or so it seemed.

The waitress was very attentive.  Dropped in twice while we were eating, had our food and drinks on the table quickly, and had me a check lickity split. They also have a way cool, super big, sports ticker spanning the windows for the outside bar.  The food was 3 stars, but the service pulled it up to 4."}
{"text":"Food is great for what it is. The outside atmosphere is and usually satisfying and the staff very friendly. I love coming with family or the wife. 

We tray to go here a few times a year in the summer! Deff stop buy!"}
{"text":"The food leaves a lot to be desired.  I ordered shrimp tacos, cold soft shells, a few breaded chopped up shrimp with a lot of sauce, it came with cheap round corn chips, and salsa.My spouse ordered the panini sandwich (not so overstuffed these days), which is the best thing on the menu, but that's not saying much.  Tall domestic draft was close to $5, seems a bit pricey for the atmosphere.  The service matches the food, OK, at best.  It's truly hard to figure out why this place is busy, maybe the patio?"}
{"text":"The restaurant advertises on the front of the building and website that they are open until 2:30am. I was meeting up for a drink with a gal after work on a Saturday and we were having a good time. The place seemed to empty out a little after our arrival, but I thought since they were open until 2:30am, no big deal. At 2 am, the \"manager\" told us, ok ladies you have to finish up. I said, \"I'm sorry, we thought you were open until 2:30am.\" His response was, \"Well technically we are, but we close based on business. So I'm not kicking you out, but I am.\" He was so rude and made us leave because they wanted to lock the doors. There was no information posted that the hours could change \"based on business.\" I am a restaurant manager and would never force a customer to leave. I will never return."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped by on super bowl Sunday for a pre game bite and drink. This is a sports bar that gets it. Lots of tvs  (with actual sports on, not infomercials), large booths, multiple bars, and a wonderful patio. 

We sat at the bar, Megan was our bartender and she was great. Gave us enough attention without being bothersome. 

Great local and standard beer selection. After scanning the 2 page menu that had plenty of variety, we settled on buffalo parmesan wings, a black bean burger on garlic bread and a grilled cheese with bacon and tomato. Everything came out in a timely manner and was delicious. The buffalo parm wing sauce can go toe to toe with anywhere. Plus, they have a late night menu that goes until last call.

Not sure if all the locations are this good, but the one in willoughby is top notch. Would highly recommend, especially for a sports lover or fantasy football draft."}
{"text":"I was happy to know that a paninis was coming to steels corner because this area was lacking in choices. It's a very open atmosphere, different from the kent paninis that feels more like a bar. This one is more family friendly since the bar and table seating are seperate. I've been here multiple times, food is good, but service is consistently average. One time I went with family and the girl just seemed annoyed that she was having to serve. We had to ask her multiple times for refills or for condiments, and even for silverware. Service is horrible at the kent paninis too so maybe they need to do better hiring within this company."}
{"text":"We had never been and didn't feel like sitting in a restaurant, so we drove up and ordered carryout:  an overstuffed cheese steak sandwich. The order was out promptly, but this was a very bland, tasteless sandwich. The slaw was crunchy but lacked flavor. You would think french fries or provolone cheese or cheesy steak would add something to it. Nope. Bland. Boring. We will not bother to try it again."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I ate here the other night, and I've never once thought to post negatively about an employee at a restaurant, because I have worked in the industry, and I know how hard it can be, but this night was different. This is my first time on Yelp, but I felt this situation was necessary to post about. I was sitting in a booth next to the host stand with my wife when my wife pointed out a manager yelling at an employee. We noticed how the manager was so intensely pointing her finger at the employee and aggressively getting in her face. The employee then walked away crying, and I think she went into the bathroom. After that incident, I witnessed the manager come up to the host stand, call the employee a bitch with a terrible attitude and that she should just fire her while she gets the chance. When the host asked her what the employee did wrong, the manager said \"I just don't like her and you guys have no idea what a bitch she is.\" I have never in my life witnessed an abuse of power more than I did in this instant. If she's going to talk terrible about the other employees she definitely shouldn't do it to her coworkers, let alone loud enough for a customer (me) to hear. She then went on to say that the servers should really stop worrying about eating at work, bc they're already fat enough and food should be the last thing on their mind. I also heard her tell the hosts to not clean 3 specific servers tables, but they can clean the others. The worst part about it was after the manager walked away we witnessed the hosts go and tell that server everything that was said. This was distracting and so unprofessional that the manager caused this issue. This manager had dark curly hair, and was wearing black leggings. My friends daughter used to work here, so I am going to contact her to then get in contact with the owner to let him know what is going on in his restaurant. (I hate to rate this restaurant bad, because our server was excellent, but our experience was ruined because of this incident.)"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Everything was great! Ordered the firecracker rolls appetizer-those were great and the sauce is really good, too. Cajun turkey wrap which was absolutely awesome! Wrap was the best thing! Also, ragin cajun chicken sandwich and Mac n cheese! Both were really good! Homemade chips & the fries were both great side choices! Definitely come back!"}
{"text":"stopped in last night for a late night quick dinner (after i was off the clock). we chose Panini's after looking at the website and liking the beer deals. $3.50 for a tall Coor's Light, yes please. 

Danielle had a Turkey Rueben w/ fries. i had an overstuffed sandwich with Capicola and an egg. i also got a cup of chili which was nearly half full w/ jalapeno peppers. it was really, really good. my sandwich was great. all in all, a successful night at Panini's. 

Andrea was playing hostess, waitress and bartender and doing a decent enough job. i felt kinda bad for her as she was the only one there  (up front)as far as I could tell."}
{"text":"Cute wait staff, great patio. The husband and I went for lunch we ordered nachos and a basket of cajun fries. The food was delicious and more than enough for the 2 of us, couldn't even finish the fries we were stuffed."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times and to the one in kent many times. I've always had great service at the kent location. Service at this location on steels corner is spotty. We sat down at the bar. 4 bartenders behind the bar and 2 of those were counting tips to leave. We were ordered our beers and food. This was the last time anyone spoke to us. My boyfriend had asked for a water after getting his beer and he never got it. The food came out and not once were we checked on. Beers were never offered until they were empty. I hate to complain but I was so just turned off by the service. The bartenders walked by us several times while eating and no one ever stopped to check in on us. The beer list is average along with the food. Service can always make or break an establishment. It's sad that right now, the service is breaking this one."}
{"text":"Went on Friday night during the Cavs Finals game. Place was packed but bar service was awful since there were only two bartenders working!  They were running around but it wasn't near enough for such a busy night. Won't go back on a big game night."}
{"text":"This is a pretty cool spot for the area. They have a nice deck and multiple bars throughout the establishment. I am a big fan of the signature sandwiches that come with coleslaw, fries and tomato on the sandwich. They have numerous options but my favorite is the Genoa salami hold the tomato! The parking can be a little tough at times and it can be hard to find a seat at the bar because the regulars sit there all day and don't leave. The bartenders are decent to look at which might be why the regulars don't leave. I am a fan and will most likely hit this place next month when I am in town for a wedding. The biggest downfall of this place is it is isolated so there is no walking to another bar from this location. That means uber or cab fare."}
{"text":"Food was good, service could of been better.  We were there for a good amount of time as this was our dinner after the movie on a Tuesday night.  Waitress came up and took our order, she never introduced herself and only the way I know her name is off the bill, which in turn stated our server was Tintor.  Not sure if that was her name or a nickname, like I said, she never introduced herself.  Took a good amount of time to get drinks and then same amount of time for her to come back to get our next drink order.  I am a big craft beer guy so I like to try beers I have not had before.  With the time we were there I only got three beers due to the fact it took so long for her to get back to us.  I ordered a sandwich and my buddy got the ribs for the main meal.  My buddy order a slice of cake and then asked if he could get a scoop of Ice Cream on the side, she stated that they don't do that but can give him a discounted price on the Ice Cream dessert...which in the end was not discounted and charged full price for the one scoop of ice cream, which if that was the case, should of just gave the table the whole second dessert.  Then I asked for a carrier for the three beer items I order, as I collect beer bottles and cans.  She stated she could not do that because it was illegal.  Hate to say it, every bar and restaurant I go to I do that.  Flying Saucer in Cordova, TN takes my empty bottles, cleans then and then places them in a carrier.  Winking Lizard in Mentor, Ohio, same thing.  I can go on and name multiple places that allow me to take home the empty bottles/cans that I bought.  Here has to say it is illegal for me to take something I bought, so in turn I still took my items without a carrier.  So as an out-of-towner having his first experience in this place I have it two-stars because the food was okay and there were some craft beers I never had before.  The service.....it could use some of work."}
{"text":"Great food. Go at happy hour. Tons of appetizers half off. We got the chicken quesadilla and the loaded fries. Our whole bill with that and 4 other apps and drinks was in the low $50's. Beer is $1 off during Happy Hour too. Get the McKenzie's Black Cherry It is amazing. Service was super nice."}
{"text":"We stopped in on a Friday night and it was understandably busy.  We put our name in.

The trio of hostesses did little to explain the length of wait time to those wanting to be seated. They furthered the situation by doing little to check on table openings.   And to add salt to the wound.  Held two tables open for parties with \"reservations\".  Those two tables remained unused for the 45 minutes we stood in the lobby. The manager was contacted and did nothing.    In fact we asked to speak to same and were told by the hostesses he was busy. 

We left soon thereafter.  We were one of many who expressed displeasure at the hostesses and the manager.   

What a shame.  Had been a decent bar/grill."}
{"text":"If you enjoy Flat Beer on draft and sandwiches with Processed meet from Oscar Myer then this is the perfect place.   
Nice TV and Bar Layout.   Too bad you can't bring your own beer and food"}
{"text":"Average bar fare...what else can I say? Opted for pizza and wings this time around. The pizza was surprisingly good (never had it sober until now lol). I ordered my fav which is pepperoni and onion and they put the onion underneath the cheese...not really a fan of that but it wasn't bad. The wings were OK, I had the garlic fury which is my usual but once again the wings could have been cooked a lot crispier. I just don't get how places haven't figured out how to cook chicken wings properly. My wife went with her staple...the Big Al which is a bacon cheeseburger with grilled onions and mushrooms. The fries with it were totally undercooked and she sent them back and crispy new ones came out almost instantly. Service was ok, a little slow at the end waiting for the check. All in all it was a decent experience."}
{"text":"We love this location and are happy to have them so close to home. A beautiful setting and great wait staff make this place a go to. I really enjoy the cheeseburger and my husband loves the gyro."}
{"text":"The Stow location follows suit with the other Panini's I have been to:  Good food and drink but sooooooo slow.  What I liked about this location was their inside/outside patio. This would be a great spot to just hang out and consume some drinks and then maybe you wouldn't notice that it took over 20 minutes to get your sandwich."}
{"text":"Terrible, cold, overpriced, shitty food. Terrible drinks, terrible service. Hot bartenders. So not all bad."}
{"text":"This is one of my husband and I's favorite restaurants!!! We visit paninis at least once a week. Awesome beer selection with a wide variety menu. I have ordered something from each section of the menu and everything has been so delicious! This place is a must go for some good grub, pizza, salad or brew."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday evening. The bartender wasn't too friendly. Ordered provolone wedges. When they came out there was no cheese in them and one side looked uncooked like they were frozen together and didn't get split apart. I was disappointed. Then I proceeded to order the chick buffalo wrap w no lettuce & chips. It came out pretty quick. The wrap had lettuce on it and didn't have hardly any chick. It did taste good tho minus the gross bag lettuce. The chips were really good and there was a lot of them. My bill was 16.00 and I left a 10.00 tip. No thank you no water refill. Luckily I had a bottle of water in the truck. 3 stars is for the taste."}
{"text":"Food is great. Thought the Overstuffed Sandwich needed more meat, it barely had any. Potato Skins with jalapeños are awesome so was the chicken quesadillas. Place was nice and clean. Server/bartender wasn't the best but worked out ok. I don't like when they take your cups to refill water cause you don't know if the cups got mixed up. I always been a fan of bringing a pitcher over to refill. Also didn't care for the no conceal carry sign on the door. Other than that the prices were good and so was the food."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick meal before the U2 concert this summer. It was a nice day so we sat on the very large patio.

Our server was very nice and polite. Got our drinks right away. We both ordered Italian sandwiches. 

They were very good and had tons of meat. I guess we assumed that based on the name of the place they would be \"Grilled Paninis\" but they were just sandwiches on texas toast. Still good, but we were hoping on something different. 

We will return again when in the area."}
{"text":"As much as I love this place and it's staff, the music hurts the ears.  If you're a 13 - year-old girl at her first slumber party, this juke box is for you!  Otherwise, be warned.

Panini's in Independence has Touch Tunes, but Willoughby can't figure it out?  This makes me sad.

Otherwise, this is the place in town to be."}
{"text":"This place was disgusting. our food took forever and when we asked about it, it came right out, cold. it had obviously been sitting in the window for awhile. Brooke was our waitress and she totally sucked. will not be back. ever."}
{"text":"Good food, busy night and they were packed.  We sat in a booth and our beer bottle service was slow, our food was hot and fresh, music loud and common for the Saturday night atmosphere.  Big ticker display was a surprise and a nice feature for sport fans.  Would return for sporting events."}
{"text":"Judging this place for what it is against the other Panini's locations it's okay I guess.  It's a newer building, so it is much nicer than some of the other locations but at the end of the day it's still just a Panini's and out in Brunstucky to boot.  

My review may be a bit slanted more for the people that go to this location than anything about the service, or food quality what-so-ever.

Oh, and by the way when you order one of their famous stuffed sandwiches you will be left wondering what you're paying for.  Over the years they have gotten smaller and smaller, but have gone up and up in price.  Cheap beer can be had at any bar, but the sandwiches were what made Panini's special.

Not any more."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of my favorite place at home - so it's probably a bias review. This location is the nicest one I've been to - although Twinsburg was good also.  Great outside seating for the summer time.  Reasonable prices, decent menu. It's always been clean at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Whether you are eating in or taking out, Panini's is the go to good food. The overstuffed sandwiches are fit for a king, but lately it seems like you are forced to order double meat for the extra money. I don't want to request, can you put about 9 less fries between the bread and two more slices of meat, but I just might have to. I can't wait for the warmer months to go and sit outside and enjoy a good cold drink. 

Next time I am going to throw it out there and see what it takes to just cover my table in the pub chips. These are probably my favorite thing on the menu. Yes, I order a side of chips with a side of chips. Don't forget the side of ranch to either dump or dip. I am a dipper. Does that make you a dumper? Either way it works and it's tasteful. 

The only reason I can't give 5 stars is because of the service sometimes isn't up to par. Sometimes you get a great server or one that gets you drinks and you don't see her back until you have to BEG for the bill."}
{"text":"It was soooo cold sitting in the restaurant with the doors to the patio open. Service was pretty good and the food was good"}
{"text":"Great food and service! Didn't wait long to be seated and our orders were exactly what we wanted."}
{"text":"Went here one night to watch the Ohio state game. Place was PACKED but our waitress still managed to be very attentive. I ordered the buffalo boneless wings and fries. Food was hot and fresh, both wings and fries were good. Also has great drink specials"}
{"text":"Not bad, exactly what you'd expect from a bar type place. The paninis are pretty good and the rest of the food is ok but service has been an issue here a couple of times. I once waited for almost an hour without a server approaching the table so I had to leave. Probably won't go back unless a bunch of people are going and I don't have a choice."}
{"text":"Much better than most other Panini's locations simply for the fact that they have their own unique menu in addition to the regular menu that Panini's is famous for.

I'd personally like to see more of a good beer selection. 

Other than that, it's just your typical sports bar. Young frat boy type of crowd. This place is always packed."}
{"text":"Date of my visit: 13-February-2017
Time of my visit: Dinner

I was on the business trip to Strongsville, OH and after giving it some thought, I wanted to go for some ribs.  I called this joint, a guy named Jason picked up the phone, I asked him if they offered ribs, he replied with affirmative \"yes\", I repeated myself, \"BBQ Ribs?\", receiving yet another affirmative \"Yes\".

I got to the place, parked and walked in, was seated very quickly and my waitress came over to take my drink order, which was unsweeten ice tea.  While she was getting my drink, I was flipping through the menu, but could not find ribs on it...  When my waitress came back with my drink, I asked her about ribs and she told me, they did not offer them.  I mentioned to her that I had spoken with a guy named Jason, before I came over and according to him they were offering ribs...  So she went over to talk to him and apparently, he thought I asked him about wings...  Okay, at that point, I almost walked out, but I figured, I would take a look at their wings.

My waitress came back up, so I figured, I would order 25 wings.  So I asked her, if I could get drumsticks only, which I could, awesome!  Then I asked how many sauces I could get with them and I was told only one, but get this, if I ordered 12 and 12, I could two different sauces...  Really?!  WTF?!  Are you fucking kidding me?!  So let me get this straight, 2 12 wings would could cost me more than 25, you could apply two different sauces on 2 12, but not on 25?!  What's the difference?!  NOTHING!  Actually, I am sorry, 2 12 wings would have cost more that was the difference!  At that point, I settled up for my tea (which the waitress offered to comp) and walked out.

An F experience!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have visited other locations previously, including downtown, Euclid and Cleveland Heights.  I think the Willoughby location is now my favorite, huge space, good menu options.   We stopped on a Sunday afternoon, while out running errands.  The restaurant had a decent crowd, but loads of space, inside and out, we opted to eat inside.  We both ordered the Chicken Caesar Wrap, I had the panini chips, my husband had fries.   The entrees arrived a short time later.  I expected grilled chicken, but the wrap contained fried chicken tenders, which were still pretty tasty, warm and added a crunchy dimension to the sandwich.  The contents were lightly tossed in a tasty caesar dressing, which was so delicious, that I requested a side, as did hubby.  My chips were good!  slightly thicker than traditional chips and seasoned nicely.   Our final bill was less than $20.....yes!!   We will make a point to frequent this location more often."}
{"text":"I was SO excited to introduce my husband to the amazing culinary implosion that is Panini's!  We finally got an hour before our bowling league to have some grub at this fine establishment.  The restaurant has been SLAMMED since opening and on our particular night we just wandered in.

Although the skeleton of the restaurant harkens back to the vintage \"Damon's\" that once held court here, it cannot compete with the homey, good natured, competetive atmosphere that this building once possessed.  Gone is the separation of the adult-based bar from the rounded booths that seat 6 snivelling children and 2 comatose parents.  Years ago any idiotic parent who dragged their child up to the bar to \"wait\" for an available table gave their children quite an education.  No one cares anymore.  It is now the drinking, gambling, sports-nut that has to protect children by watching their language and moving over so \"junior's\" feet don't kick their shins.

We were able to order \"true\" Panini's - although it took me 20 minutes to locate them on the back side of the menu.  I will say that mine was DELICIOUS with a soft white bread and far too wide to bite into!  

Sadly, this location has become a Chucky Cheese-like restaurant catering to the young politically-correct parents who refuse to discipline their children.

I miss the days when the restaurant manager lofted a pig trophy over his head and paraded it to my table because I knew how many woman Caeser had slept with.  So sad..."}
{"text":"Great ambience and hospitality to begin with. My friends and I did take out. It was my first time so I asked the server for suggestions. I had the patty melt medium rare and added jalapenos to it for a little zing with pub chips. It was a great, very filling sandwich and very juicy.  My friends had the ragin cajun chicken sandwich and the chicken was definitely super yum too. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Ok, So I have been to this bar/restaurant many times on a Friday during happy hour and have stayed till bar close.........thats how much fun it is up there.  They have a gorgeous outside patio with full bar and a fire pit, bartenders are extremely friendly and love making fun new shots for you to try!!!!  Me and my friends have gone up on many fridays after work and before we knew LAST CALL! We always meet new fun, friendly people there and just have a blast.  We got to know the bartenders and they are so fun and nice always making sure everyone is taken care of.  Now I have been inside the restaurant twice and both times order the grilled cheese.  first time me and a friend went early in the afternoon, there were about 3 other tables..........it took FOREVER for someone to come greet us! When we got our grilled cheese sandwiched we wanted to puke.......HORRIBLE!!!!!! I have been to the paninis in strongsville and their grilled cheese is amazing!  So I went back yesterday after work to meet up with a friend.  We were seated right away.  My friend asked if there were any drink specials and our waitress looked at us and said \"i dont know what time is it\" WHAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! my jaw dropped YOU ARE THE WAITRESS, YOU tell ME what time it is and what specials you have, dont look at us to tell you!  Anyways, again i ordered the grilled cheese and this time i was more satisfied.....actually i ate the whole darn thing......oops! Our waitress dropped off the little black book with the bill and before we even had a chance to put our money in it, she grabbed the book and said \"ill be back with your change\" WHAT! we didnt stop her, we let her her feel dumb....she came back and apologized, we got a good laugh out of it.  So overall the place is great to get together with friends and have some drinks on their patio............going to eat there eh not so much."}
{"text":"Okay, I have tried this place twice.  There was very few people at 6pm.  The parking lot looks like the employees were parked right near the door.  They have outdoor seating, with nice looking bar outside.  The menu looks good, but the sandwichs fall pretty short.  The cole slaw is described as not very good, coarse ground with little mayo.  The Hot Italian, the Patty melt, Blt, and wings are worth getting somewhere else.  They have friendly staff and the drinks never ran dry.  Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Ok but bartender was very inattentive. Spent her time washing dishes instead of filling the 4-5 empty glasses at the bar. We didn't stay for a 3rd drink"}
{"text":"Is it illegal in Ohio to smoke in a restaurant?  Well.  Yes.  And, no.  Here's the exception:  outdoor patios.

Panini's has an outdoor patio, underneath a roof, with alfresco bar.  So, lugnuts can flame up and still get half-schnockered, covering two of the three legal vices in one crack.  (The crack is the third, for those awaiting the shoe drop.)

Panini's also has giant floor-to-ceiling doors that, when flung open, connect the outdoor area with the indoor area.  So, in effect, the entire restaurant is smoke-friendly.  How great is that?  For nic-heads, that's probably a sweet deal.  For me?  My fambly?  Nope.  That's just not a good thing.  If I'm outside somewhere, sure, I accept that people will be tugging on those five-buck per pack penis substitutes.  I just try to stand up-wind.  Or, I go home.  That's outside.  Where you can smoke.

Inside?  There just should not be smoke.  Fix that."}
{"text":"Great service...kids inhaled the grilled cheese.  My bun on my grilled buffalo chicken sandwich was...sticky...????weird.  And the server was a little busy.  Other than that still a great place to go for dinner."}
{"text":"Rude, impatient server... Food was good and view was beautiful.   Felt like we were being hurried out even though the patio area was wide open."}
{"text":"Great girls and good food cant go wrong for lunch dinner or just out for drinks"}
{"text":"My husband and I really liked this place. It's a little noisier than a BW3 but same concept (sports bar). The wings were really good, there was a lot of sauce, the loaded fries were delicious, we started with the buffalo blue chips and they were REALLY good. Despite it being busy, the service was great."}
{"text":"This place is pretty consistent. Good food and good service. One thing I do not like is when you order the appetizers with the chips and different dips, they put the dip in these trays and they over cook them. Not worth the money in my opinion. I would recommend going back to the old way. They did change the menu with price increases. I do not really recommend the breakfast buffet. It's okay but the omelets could be bigger.

I came in today with my family. Our server was Laura. She was kind of rude and not very pleasant. My parents had asked her questions and she responded with attitude. She messed up my dad and I order. Ordered panini's, the both of us and they came with no fries on the sandwich. When the sandwiches were fixed they came back with 4 fries in the sandwiches, no joke. Very disappointed this time around. Both in service and quality."}
{"text":"The food isn't that great and the service is even worse. We went in and waited at our table for about fifteen minutes before our server came up to us. Then they have at least 20 TV's but it's the same thing on every single one. I asked to have a game put on and the manager said no. So I hopped on 71 south and got off at route 18 and went to a sports bar there."}
{"text":"Love Paninis love the location hate the lack of service went in Sunday not busy at all I quickly put in my seat no one spoke to me in 15 minutes no one said a word and 3 employees walked by me...I got up and left and still no one spoke to me service is horrible but that is a management issue if you ask me servers are all kids...hope they fix it soon they have one more chance and they are lucky they have that"}
{"text":"Date night!!
Ordered the Spinach Artichoke dip and sampler platter with a couple Summer Shandys....
YUM!!!!!
I'm so freaken' easy when simple is done right..."}
{"text":"Food good. 
Yet unfortunately the service was more than ignorant.  I'm not confident I'll be back based on the servers views against people that are black.  I was simply discussing the concern of CLE with the RNC being in town and she went off."}
{"text":"My Star Rating Scale: 
1- I will never ever return!
2- Okay, Meh.
3- Good, but my mom's is better. (lol)

Overall Experience: 2 - but I won't be back!

Breakdown: I have visited different Panini's and this one sucked! I accompanied my friend and the food took forever to come. On top of that, my friends order was wrong and he had to send it back. While they did offer him a free app for his wait... the original order took over 20 min to come back out after we already waited. While waiting on his food, my already cold food got colder. They offered to take his wings off his bill. I had to sit there for additional time while he finished up and they offered me NOTHING for my wait. Now, had they not took so long fixing his order, I wouldn't have been so upset, but the fact they seemed to think my time wasn't of value -- no. I was so upset, I didn't really feel in the mood to discuss this with management. I just needed to leave. The cheese sticks were cold. The wings weren't as described and you can just look for yourself how the tacos came out. It was all mediocre at best. Will not be back to this location! 

Final Thoughts: You can look at my reviews and see I am a more than fair person. This was a mess. Don't go!"}
{"text":"Always have great food and always packed. We usually do the carry out as there is a large number of us, and the dining room is usually packed and very loud. A little bit on the expensive side, but still a great buy."}
{"text":"Diabolical. Horrible excuse for food. No attention from bar staff. One and gone. It's hard to elaborate wish I could find something nice to say apart from the place has lots of potential."}
{"text":"Wings were good but didn't come fried hard as requested. Food is priced decently as well. Hostess immediately sat us. The waitress was good but kept trying to bring us to go boxes when we finished all of our food. Bet the it gets really crowded during football season."}
{"text":"I like the setup and how spacious it is.  The staff was also very friendly.  I had the Chicken Caesar Salad and a side of the house special pub fries.  The pub fries were a bit disappointing, but the salad was very tasty."}
{"text":"This is a good place to watch a game.  Great sports bar atmosphere, and good selection of beers.  I would love to give it a higher rating, but there is no excuse for their food.  It's not that it's bad; it just isn't good and with a franchise this big they should come up with some good food.  The bland sandwiches'  only claim to fame is that they're really big.  Floppy fries, overall indifference to taste.  Don't they have a professional of some kind designing their food options?   
That's a complaint against the franchise in general.   But I can say that this site on Steels Corners really is a cool place - clean, bright and spacious, with indoor and outdoor bars."}
{"text":"Good food selection! Love the atmosphere. Not a huge fan of the prices, though. And there have been a couple of times where the food wasn't the best for what I was paying. Especially their salads. But a good place to hang out and enjoy a beer after work."}
{"text":"In town for the Zach Brown Band concert and ordered food from Panini's to go....went with the steak and cheese with egg and turkey panini and chicken wings....now if you have never been to Panini's, it is basically an overstuffed sandwich (think Primanti Brothers of Northeast Ohio)...the sandwich contents are cheese, fries(yes fries are in the sandwich), tomato and a vinegar based slaw and your choice of meat....sandwich are on typical italian bread, not a sub bun, and usually run about $7...the sandwiches are outstanding with a beer or soda...for those of you that don't like fries on your sandwich try the pizza....pizza they sell by the slice(after midnight) or and entire pizza.....i believe they just make cheese and pepperoni, highly recommend the cheese....great to soak up that buzz or if you are looking for food after a blossom show it more than fits the bill....Wings were good, drummies were cooked and crispy to the bite, the flappers were a bit undercooked, I don't like a rubbery wing....The buffalo sauce was delicious, mellow yet had that Frank's hot sauce vinegar base....The bar at Panini's is pretty large, quite a number of tables to sit and watch the game and a back bar area as well that I highly recommend if you have a large group of people....I've been to the Panini's at E. 9th and Prospect hundred's of times when I had season tickets to Indians games...the Panini's in Stow is a nice neighborhood joint to watch the game grab a bite and get a cold one...highly recommend to locals or pre/post concerts at Blossom....Enjoy : ))"}
{"text":"It is what it is. Your typical sports bar--nothing to write home about, but not bad. The buffalo fries appetizer was great. It's super convenient for all of the apartment complexes nearby, and it's right off of route 8."}
{"text":"The Paninis family of servers and staff are always pleasant and will go out of their way to accommodate the guests! The food is also outstanding! Would recommend it as a fantastic dining experience!!!"}
{"text":"We put in a reservation at 5:45 on a Tuesday for a decent size group....didn't end up getting our food until 7:20. I ordered the single serving pizza with side Caesar salad. Pizza was good and no complaints for the typical side Caesar salad. Friends ordered another pizza and the jumbo pretzels. Servers did the best they could with giving refills and seeing if we needed anything - not sure if the wait had to do from the kitchen but just disappointed. Not the best visit."}
{"text":"I didn't know Panini's had taken over the old Damon's until last week. I looked at their website and found they had a Fried Lake Erie Perch Dinner for $10.99, served with hand-cut fries & creamy coleslaw. Sounded good, so off I went. When I arrived just before 4 pm, there was a sign that said to seat yourself and I did not see another human being anywhere. Once my waitress, Katie, arrived, I ordered the perch dinner. When it came out, it looked overcooked (see picture). I tried a few bites, and the fries were good but the fish had no flavor at all. When Katie returned, I said since she knew what the perch was supposed to look like, did it look overcooked to her. Her response summed up the Panini's employee philosophy I suspect:  \"I don't know, I don't pay any attention\".  They redid the meal, but still no flavor. Never offered a drink refill. The place is definitely a bar, not a restaurant. I have no interest in returning."}
{"text":"Good food but the service unfortunately wasn't!  We had to constantly ask repeatedly for drinks, condiments, extra napkins. I understand having to remind someone once, but throughout the evening we had to remind her 10 times to bring another drink!  We were a group of 6 and the server wasn't too busy having only 4 other small tables.   Very nice outdoor seating, good parking & fun environment"}
{"text":"I think it's funny when reviewers slam a sports bar type restaurant for the service or food not being perfect.  Panini's is not a 4 star restaurant but It is undeniably a good time.  The food is mostly typical bar food, but the sandwiches are one of a kind.  Good time had by all."}
{"text":"The service was extremely slow.  I ordered a drink off the menu and the waitress asked me how to make it."}
{"text":"I refuse to try this place anymore. Their food is pretty awful, and Ive never found their wait staff to be overly friendly at all. I got a sandwich with fries, and ordered a side of ranch. They charged me 75 cents for tiny cup of ranch. If they want to charge me thats fine, but thats a bit excessive. I think the only thing this place has going for it is the location."}
{"text":"Thursday night after work and had the evening to myself which is rare with a toddler.  Walked into a full bar and, having heard bad things from friends, figured I'd be in for a poor experience. 

Not at all the case.  It did take a couple minutes to get the bartender's attention, but she was rolling solo with about 30 seats full, so that's to be expected.  No Great Lakes Octoberfest on tap, so settled for a vanilla porter which was yummy.  The staff worked well as a team since the bar was swamped.  

Ordered food and it came out quick and hot and tasty.  My beer ran out and there was Kelly Jo with a freshly tapped Octoberfest before I even asked. 

Friendly staff, great bartender, good food. 

Sounds like 5 stars, right?"}
{"text":"The overstuffed sandwiches Panini's made famous are always great, but the rest of the food is ok as far as \"bar food\" goes.  And on my last visit the server actually got the entire order wrong.  Not kidding.

But the place is fun if you want to hang out and have a few beers."}
{"text":"Bugs.... Flying bugs.... I just hate that.... But all in all this place is pretty good, bathrooms are clean, a must for me!   Also, bartender was neat clean an tedious, right on!  Studious!  That is solid in place like this!  She is the only reason why I have stayed and gave it a 3,  she made the bar and was all by herself, and it's a horseshoe, 32 seats and 20 seats on a Tuesday, nice job!"}
{"text":"4 of us got there around 11pm on a Wednesday night and were immediately greated by a friendly bartender. We were ordering food and she kindly let us know that we had an hour left for the full menu. I usually always get the turkey panini but tried the panini wrap this time and was surprised on how much better i liked it! We also split an order of the hot pretzels which had an awesome cheese dip. It looked gross because it was kinda brown, but wasn't just the same old same old nacho cheese. It had a little kick to it. Give it a try :)"}
{"text":"They were very good the bar tenders were so funny they had cheap drinks and good food, great people go there"}
{"text":"This is a very fun place to hangout with friends and have some drinks. It's a nice local bar. Sometimes service isn't too great (but they're either training or busy so it's understanding) but if you ask for Nick, you'll get the best service. He goes out of his way for anyone and is a true gentleman. He will let you sample things and he's very attentive.
OKAY BUT NO BAKED POTATOES"}
{"text":"First off, I like anyplace where they'll turn off the music so you can hear a big game. 

Beer of the month was Shock Top, which means it  was $4 for a tall. I soaked up three of those and a yummy wrap that's a new addition to the menu: the Tuscan Wrap, which was delicious. They even asked me white or wheat (always a plus to offer wheat!). The Cajun mustard on the wrap was delish, but leaked all over the place. I strategically leaked it over the pub chips that came with my dish to give them a little more flavor. I wasn't overly impressed with the pub chips. They were crunchy and not too greasy, just there wasn't much flavor going on there for me.

I went on a pretty crowded Thursday night, but got a prime seat at the bar in front of two decent-sized HDTVs. I didn't go out to the patio, which looked huge and had a giant screen. 

My server was the bartender, and she did a good job of making the rounds to check in and answering my questions. 

The women's restroom was also clean and serviceable."}
{"text":"Have to say I love this place!  Baretenters and the management staff is amazing.  Someone that has been in this business for years it's great to see managers doing table visits and really giving a damn what's going on! Kudos to the staff!"}
{"text":"Terrible. Food not as pictured or described and not prepared well at all. I could have done better by going to fast food for lunch. Chips are the standard side with burgers and sandwiches, but they burned them...typical for a lazy kitchen that doesn't want to cook chips at the required lower temperature than the fries.  Really I'm not that picky, but this food was completely bad.  I would have told them, but no one cared to ask how our meal was...as though they already knew.  Never coming here again."}
{"text":"So we were sitting at the bar and watching the kitchen. I will never ever ever eat here again.  The cook never changed his gloves.  He touched raw beef then straight to lettuce. Then proceeded to cut chicken on the same cutting board. A ticket fell on the floor and once again he picked it up and proceeded to plate a To go order. He also touched tortilla chips and wiped his nose all with the same gloves. I've been a chef for over 20 years and I would have never hired this kid or I would fire him on the spot... If you want to wear a diaper then eat here. I sure wont..."}
{"text":"Last night, I went there with my husband and another couple. Music was way too loud. My husband's meal included coleslaw. He didn't eat all of it. As our server was clearing our table, she accidentally spilled it on the table, ME, the bench, and the floor. She acted like it was no big deal. Right away said to my husband, \"I didn't get you did I?\" . No, but she spilled most of it on me, on my brand new shirt. Both she and my husband made light of it. But guess what? I pretreated it and put it in the washer as soon as we got home, and the oily stains are STILL there! She avoided us for a while, as she knew I was upset. Sent the manager to us eventually, since my husband said she should give us a free round of drinks. She had said, \"I can't do that! It'll come out of my pay!\" Manager took one of my drinks off the bill. Big deal! Won't be going back there any time soon!!!"}
{"text":"The Willoughby Panini's is probably my favorite location. Always very clean and inviting. Servers are all great. I'd definitely recommend the Italian wrap with pub chips, but the entire menu has great options."}
{"text":"Steph...I'm an old frat guy....we're not all that bad....are we??  OK....Panini's of Willoughby....what can I say?  Great Deck / Patio!!  How BIG is that screen they play the big game on, 100+ inches??  During the summer months its like having 3 bars in one.  I prefer the patio or the back bar but have nothing against any bar stool, anywhere.  

A couple of the bartenders came from the Mick's regime so that's nice to see them again.  I enjoy their pizza and wings of course.  I too would like to see a better beer selection or more rotating taps.  Great place for families or after work drinks.  Its usually busy so don't be surprised if you have to wait a little bit.  Great restrooms, when they are clean."}
{"text":"Will not come back here went out for opening night of college football and had a table for an hour and they abruptly changed every tv in the place to the Browns preseason game with still nearly a whole quarter before halftime in SC- NC game. No problem with this but don't advertise yourself as a sports bar if you only cater to one crowd. Unless you are a Browns fan find somewhere else to watch football."}
{"text":"Our waitress was a joke.  It was clear she wasn't concerned with being there.  We brought up some hair and what we hope was pepper in the salt shaker.  She didn't care.  She didn't check in us.  The food was good.  Probably 4 or 5 stars if we sat somewhere else"}
{"text":"The food is what you'd expect from a Panini's, it's straightforward and consistent. The one in Concord has a better patio, but the nice thing about this location is it is not near a golf course. And if downtown Willoughby gets overrun with 21 year olds, this is a good escape. Good place to watch sports and eat a sandwich."}
{"text":"I had the super stuffed corned beef sandwich. It was good, nothing great.

The place is more of a sports bar than anything else, lots of tv sets on the wall showing sports if that's what you're into.

Clean place, service was OK, prices are a bit high with most items starting at $10.

Nothing special about the food, service or ambiance, but it wasn't bad either."}
{"text":"Been there serval times and was happy with the food not the service at all. Euclid has better service just saying!!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here once every couple weeks. Food and service are always great! Their buffalo chicken dip is the best I have ever had. The salads, wraps and fries are good too."}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly and attentive. The patio had a gray vibe!!! The food was really good as usual."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is awesome. The atmosphere and patio are awesome. Doris the server is the sweetest and cutest one in Willoughby. The food is delicious, prices affordable, and its clean too!"}
{"text":"Lots of tvs. A wide variety on the menu: pizza, wraps, salads, wings, and of course paninis. Server was very friendly. A very casual place to take a family or meet up with friends after work."}
{"text":"Long Time Panini's fan-first time at this establishment.
My boyfriend and I went this past Friday night around 7 PM we were able to get seated right away. However we asked to sit out on the patio the girl said sure no problem and then walked us all the way to the door next to the patio and sat us down next to the emergency exit.  We decided to take our menus and go sit on the patio, only to be told there was a private party going on-why didn't the hostess didn't just tell us this, as she could have sat us at a much better table

Service was OK. We got our drinks quickly.  My boyfriend had told me what he wanted, and went to use the restroom. I noticed something on that menu item that I wasn't sure if he wanted, so when the server came back I asked her if she would just give me a moment and as soon as he got back from the restroom we would order. He was back within one minute and yet it took her almost 10 to come back. He did change his order -she asked if you would like his bread toasted (Panini).  He said yes-and  she neglected to tell him that if you get it toasted it's garlic toast. And he said it was overpowering. I personally love the Panini sandwich and people do you need to understand that these are the overstuffed sandwiches that are very popular in Cleveland and Pittsburgh. Not the type of sandwich that is put into a grill press. I would probably go back, simply because I do love those sandwiches. But I will hope for better service."}
{"text":"Love the Willoughby Panini's. Staff is so kind and welcoming. The fire place is me and my co workers favorite after work de briefing spot. Oh and the quesidillas, pizza and spinach and artichoke dip are AMAZING!"}
{"text":"You know, I'll go ahead and give Panini's a good rating.

Went for a work lunch and it was better than the average Panini's experience.  There's many locations in the Cleveland area, and they all conform to the similar standards.  They are all attractive restaurants, with women bartenders and servers, and a menu that revolves around fried food in sandwiches.

This one stuck out because the burger I had was actually really, really good.  Is it amazing? Nah.  But it was really good, and that's more than I'm accustomed to when getting burgers when out.  The bun was soft, fluffy, and slightly grilled.  The cheese, guacamole, and jalapeños made for a perfect combo.  My customer had a basic side salad and a pizza, and the pizza's are always good.  It was Fat Tuesday, so they had gumbo for soup, and despite the teeny tiny shrimp, it was overall a spicy little addition.  The bartender was also very nice and attentive.  

So in short, a good experience, and above average for Panini's."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great wings and pizza. I stop in every time I'm in Ohio."}
{"text":"With all my time spent out here(living from 99 to 2006), I had never been in here. Been to every dtw bar, every Euclid ave food joint, but never here. Finally stopped in to get carry out for my in laws on Fathers Day. Got a double cheeseburger and eggplant parm for the wife. Pounded a 24 oz Thirsty Dog while waiting. Typical sports decor, awesome outdoor area and nice staff. Ended up not eating food till 8 hours later after getting wasted with pa in law. It was still pretty good. Most of the time I get Panini's(even at Kamms Koroners), it's to have food ready when I'm fucked up and can't responsibly work a stove. Thanks for that Panini's! You have prevented several housefires and visits from those 19 News shitheads to my crib."}
{"text":"Good food, generous portions, excellent hd tv's, and they have specials on pitchers! Service could improve (understaffed) but the indoor/outdoor seating is excellent for lunch or dinner. Very updated decor."}
{"text":"If you haven't been to Paninis you must be living under a rock, in the Taco Bell drive through at 1:00 am, or from out of town. If all yins are visiting from Pittsburgh, it's a Primanti Bros rip off.  The claim to fame are the overstuffed panini sandwiches that come piled high with your choice of deli meats, fries, etc all jammed in the sandwich served on thick sliced bread. The sandwiches are pretty delicious. Otherwise it's the normal bar and grill food. The Brunswick location has a very nice outdoor patio and bar overlooking Brunswick lake (and the back end of Giant Eagle, so much for ambiance)."}
{"text":"Such RUDE hostesses. We met my husband here for a late lunch and he was watching the Indians game on the patio. We asked a server if we could move from the bar to a table and she sent us to the hostess stand to be seated. No problem. When I approached the hostess stand I obviously interrupted a bitch session and when I asked to be seated on the practically empty patio so we could still watch the game she snapped at me. I asked to be seated so that we could watch the game and she sat us clear on the other side of the patio with no view of the TV. I asked her once again and she said \"this is fine right here\". She was very rude. When the server came over she graciously moved us to another table. No manager came to check on us...after we requested to speak to one."}
{"text":"Good service, great food & relaxing environment. We sat inside but they had the doors open to the outside. It was nice to feel the cool breeze see the sun shining & enjoy lunch with my family."}
{"text":"Real cool place; I never drive to that area so didn't even know it existed until today.
We had a private event and they served some of the appetizers on the menu, and everything tasted great. The bartender was very attentive and came to the tables to refill drinks and clear the empty plates.
The general bar area was very lively and surrounded by TV screens. Looks like a real nice place to hang out at with friends, at any time of the day."}
{"text":"Flat beer and staff had little knowledge of the beers they offered. I can't eat fast food bc it severely upsets my stomach, their food made me sick too. Not quite sure what that says about the quality of what they serve, but draw your own conclusions...Overall, bad food, okay beer = decent sports bar but bad restaurant."}
{"text":"Awesome sandwiches and wraps! Great beer selection with good game time specials (Cavs/Indians/Browns). Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We came here to meet another family for dinner with our children. Great place for family!! Other than, it's so LOUD if there is a big game on TV. Hopefully your restaurant can figure out how your customers can listen to the big game and also your other guests who are not there for the game to enjoy their food and friends. 

As for the rest, food quality is good and the help we had was great. Great location that's easy to get to right off the highway."}
{"text":"The service is great, so I have no problems there. Always super friendly, and helpful, and usually pretty fast as well. What doesn't make any sense is how boring the menu is. Besides the actual panini sandwiches, there really is nothing special at all. Mediocre bar food with a sub par menu. The actual building is great, and there is an awesome deck to hang out on during warm months to enjoy a drink with friends, but if you are expecting a high end meal, I would go somewhere else."}
{"text":"The Panini's restaurants are never as fun as the ones downtown, but I still love them!! Great place to come for a drink and some food to wash it down!"}
