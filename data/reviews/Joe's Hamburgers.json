I was amazed how fast my Shawarma dinner was made. The shawarma plate comes with salad and pita bread. It tasted really good, I recommend anyone in that area looking to eat some delicious food!"}
{"text":"I dont really like sharwama but my co-worker convinced me to stop by for lunch. Its good food. :-)"}
{"text":"This 4-star rating is solely given to one item on the menu - the Chicken Shawarma on a pita with a side of crispy fries. This dish is one of the best I've ever had --- period. And the fries remind me of childhood. The restaurant itself can be a little sore on the eyes but this is definitely one of those spots that you don't judge by the decor nor from the outside."}
{"text":"Friendly and fast service. Consistently good. Our family's go to place when craving shawarma or souvlaki. If a picky 4 year old likes eating their souvlaki dinner, that says a lot!"}
{"text":"Great tzaziki and salad with the shawarma dinner. Massive portions a little pricy but good stuff"}
{"text":"Have eaten here a few times.  Wraps and Pita sandwiches are a fair size.  Shwarma is decent but is bit salty.  Fries are good.   Burgers are medicore, comparable to Burger King but better than McDonald's burgers.  Every time someone in the family gets a burger the buns are always stale.   Tried it again the other day and burger buns are stil stale and hard.   To a point where the bun literally crumbles on you as you eat the burger.  And the prices are not cheap either as you much expect from a fast food place."}
{"text":"I've been going here for years and it's amazing! The falafel is the best I've ever had. Love that it's family owned. Be prepared to wait for a little bit, cause there's usually a line, but it's well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the banquet burger.  Fresh cut fries were delicious as well.   Looking forward to trying more off the menu.  Martin"}
{"text":"good shawarma. but a bit pricey. there are NO other places anywhere within about 15 miles or so that have shawarma that compares.

have joes big burger if you want a fairly good burger that is big. real big. big enough so when I eat it I look like I have two heads - one trying to eat the other. (yes I'm weird but you haven't seen this burger...)

fries are fresh cut. good. and yellow (maybe the potatos they use...)

falaffel is also quite good and made to order.
salads are good. 
if you get a platter be prepared for a big portion of food. 

place is regularly busy at key meal periods. staff is attentive and quick. 

price might seem a bit high because its diner food (its about 8-10 bucks for a combo) but it really is good quality and something i never regret."}
{"text":"By far the best burger joint in Richmond Hill. Chicken shwarma is absolutely amazing!!! Staff is super helpful and friendly. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"hmmm..what's a shawarma, I thought this was a burger joint.

I ordered the shawarma combo for lunch, as the shawarma seemed to be a popular choice.  The shawarma was huge.  Enough for lunch by it's own.  Of course fries come with the combo.  The hand cut fries were fried to order.  They came out crisp and golden.  Not cut like typical fries, they are very thin.  Doused with gravy, the fries are tasty.  Overall the food was good.   But why all the sad faces from the workers.  I wanted 'Free Smiles' like McDs"}
{"text":"Good food, have been coming here for years. A couple of things that bug me, though. Joe's has raised their prices SIGNIFICANTLY in the past few years, several times. I guess they figure people will still keep coming. Also, every time their is a holiday, Joe's closes the weekend before. For example, as Thanksgiving is today, Joe's closed from Friday on.. Their perogative, but at LEAST have an outgoing message on their voicemail to indicate this. They just put up a small sign on their door to tell customers that they are closed, which means the customer has already driven to the restaurant. VERY annoying. In fact, maybe get VOICEMAIL!!??"}
{"text":"I cannot go through Richmond Hill without stopping at Joe's. The food is excellent. The souvlaki is super moist and tasty. Joe seems to know all of his regular customers and always takes the time to ask how they are. 

The place is always busy so be prepared for a slight wait; this is a good reflection of the quality of the food. 

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I was excited about all the reviews saying they made the best shawarma's. So, I ordered a chicken shawarma.

Honestly, I'm not sure how you can call this a shawarma other than the cooking method. It was very fatty and the meat was nice and all but it was very bland and missing all the typical spices. Tasted like salt + pepper only...I think they threw some parsley on top which looked nice but didn't really add to the flavour. 

The rice was that typical yellow rice. The salad dressing and salad was pretty basic...nothing special. I guess if you don't like middle eastern food but want to pretend this is the place to go.

The restaurant was clean. Reminded me a bit of a diner. The lady at the counter was attentive. They probably make a pretty good burger...but I didn't try it. Lots of seating in the back. 

It was fairly expensive...I think the chicken shawarma ended up being around $15. That's some chicken on top of some rice and a side salad. It was enough to fill me up but certainly nothing special."}
{"text":"Great Diner style restaurant.  Fast service, tasty food, good portions.  Honestly i can say the Best Falafels in the Greater Toronto Area, you have to try their falafel sandwich.  I go there at least once a week for lunch from work, it's about a ten minute drive but worth it.  I used to live in Dearborn Michigan which is a city known for their lebanese/arabic food and Joe's Falafels are much better then anything i have had there.  burgers and shawrmas are good too.  Don't expect 5 star dining experience, expect good fresh food at a good price."}
{"text":"while the shawarma dinner plate was good, it was pretty expensive. $15 even which is a bit higher than average. The meat was well seasoned and the rice was standout good. The portions are quite large, but still, $15 is a bit high"}
{"text":"I eat here every now and then.  I always have the same thing, steak pita rare.  It's a great 6oz filet, tender and tasty.   I think its $9.  Great value.  However, it can take more than 20 minutes to get your food as they lack organization between ordering and preparation."}
{"text":"I met up with a friend at lunch today we decided to have us some burgers. She ordered a 1/4 pound combo I decided on the Joe's Hamburger (probably a 1/2 pound) :)

After putting on the fixings it quite a towering sight!  
The toppings were standard affair (tomato, lettuce, pickle) except for the grilled onions. 

Moment of truth:

I polished off my burger in less than 5min. The sesame bun managed to stay together halfway through but my mayo, ketchup, relish, burger juices was a tad bit overwhelming and caused the bun to explode. The patty itself was grilled well.   

The fries were made in house - fresh potatoes cut into flat rectangular shape with the skin on them not very crisp but they are good, the onion rings were also house made had that distinct home made flavour of batter. (the ones I've made at home taste the same)

I like the place, the burgers, fries and onion rings were great. We saw some diners having souvlaki that looked very appetizing too. Something I'll keep in mind for next time I visit Joe's."}
{"text":"The chicken shawarma is fresh, tasty and juicy! 
Love their fries and onion wings too!
Staff are friendly and recognized you after few visits.  They would ask about my babies and a little chit chat while I waited for my food."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place, used to go every weekend. I've only stop as I am not long in the area for 2/3 of the year and I know just how bad this food choice in terms of healthy eating. 

If you are looking for great shwarmas and falafels this is one of the best in the GTA. I have yet to try the rice plates, but one of my friends make that his main order.

They offer both whole wheat and white pita bread and customizing your fillings is extended beyond what you can see in the main assembly area if you take the time to ask. 

The prices are on the expensive side if you have become accustommed to the prices offered downtown T.O, however considering the quality of the food served I'm not complaining. The falafel starts at ~5 and the Shwarmas are ~7.

The environment has been through an expansion so there is always a place to sit which is great especially when I have asked for extra hot sauce which seems to seep through the pita really quickly (not a fault of Joe's) 

Great for a once in a while treat if you are watching your health, but definitely a treat that should be taken in."}
{"text":"Its alright, Ive gone with friends i wouldn't go on my own. Big reputation, okay food."}
{"text":"Love this place!! The only place that can cure my hamburger craving.
Grew up with Joe's kids, have been eating the amazing food here for at least 10 years now!!"}
{"text":"Best chicken shwarma I've had, wife agrees too. No frills just good food."}
{"text":"Good food, shawarma is pretty good when they cut it fresh and not from the one that they pre cut ahead of time. Hamburgers are great, good topping selection. Service is not professional or good at all. Parking is also very brutal, would go back once in a blue moon."}
{"text":"Today my nana & I went to Joe's & we were thoroughly disappointed in the food quality, quantity & service. We had both been here in the past in the food was excellent. Today we had ordered a hamburger, fries & onion rings- & let me tell you how ridiculous frivolous the portions were. 5 dried out onion rings, a small plate of fries & thin tasteless meat on the hamburgers. This was an absolute joke for the cost. I would above & beyond prefer even a McDonald's angus burger over this meal. Be warned. This is not the value it once was."}
{"text":"FOOD
They stuff your wrap with a fair chunk of meat! Not too many dine in and mostly take outs. Food is fresh and always busy there. You'd catch a lot of police and firemen grabbing a bite to eat there. The people who works there are friendly.

PARKING
Its a nightmare there as there's only so much parking in this tiny isolated plaza. During rush hours, it's the worst. If you can wait out lunch or have an early lunch, you will be guaranteed a parking spot. Closer to lunch, you'd have to camp out for a spot."}
{"text":"As soon as I tried the Joes big burger, I fell in love. I recommend trying there food at least once in your life. Just be warned you'll be hooked."}
{"text":"Joe's will always be a classic in Richmond Hill. Long wait though so recommend calling in to order. Big portions and good food"}
{"text":"A little hidden gem of middle eastern food.  Absolutely love the shawarma here."}
{"text":"My one and only complaint about Joe's is that it always seems to be closed when I'm craving it the most. Otherwise, it's probably my favourite restaurant in Richmond Hill. I live 5 minutes away (thank goodness) and I've been here more times than I can count. I typically get the shish kebab with rice and it's delicious!  

The price is very reasonable for the huge portions you receive. The staff is always friendly and quick. The atmosphere is relaxed and you can always find a seat (but I actually prefer getting take-out). I really, really love it here and would happily recommend it to anyone who likes Middle Eastern food and lives in/around Richmond Hill."}
{"text":"How in God's name have I lived in Richmond Hill my entire life and never ventured into Joe's for anything more than a shawarma sandwich? I included them in the hamburger issue of the weekly Yelp several weeks back because the lore of their famous burgers has stood the test of time in R.Hill for years and everyone who eats at Joe's agrees they've got it going on in burger land. 

Despite this impressive yelpo-mercial for their burgers that wasn't what I chose to dine on last night..I mean the 2, 4 and 8oz patties sound amazing BUT if I'm going to Joe's I'm going to have the Joe's famous burger that Edwin A sold me on in his earlier review. To accomplish that fear poppa is gonna need his Full appetite firing on all cylinders, not just a 9:30PM \"I'm hungry and need to eat something that's not too filling.\" 

Kris you wimp - get in there and stop procrastinating...

Ok ok self...I promise next time I've got an hankering for a greasy Burb-ger I'm hitting Joe's. But for last night's purposes I ordered the steak sandwich on a bun. WOW. Floored me! In minutes they were able to produce a perfectly cooked medium rare angus steak (made fresh to order) which they garnished with my choice of toppings (BBQ sauce, onions, pickles, and homemade coleslaw).

Killer! That's all I have to say...will update once I've had a burger."}
{"text":"Amazing food, HUGE portions, friendly staff very clean. Need I say more? People say pricey but considering what we got we were more than glad to pay."}
{"text":"When it comes to fast food in Richmond Hill, this is as good as it gets. Excellent Shawarma and great hamburgers."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Best shawarma and Chicken souvlaki. It was very tender and juicy. The only place that feels like home made food. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Was in the area when I saw it and remembered I bookmarked it ages ago to try. Tried the shawarma on a salad and like other reviewers mentioned, it was a little pricy for a salad but delicious, meat was not dry and large portions.  Hubs and I shared it as an afternoon snack.  It was really busy for middle of the afternoon - after lunch and before dinner.  Steady line of people were ordering burgers.  Have to come back and try the Burger before we can give it a 5."}
{"text":"Comparable to an upscale Harvey's with juicier burgers.  Get the combo's as the fries or onion rings portions are huge.  Drinks are in cans or bottles, not fountain type."}
{"text":"Chicken Shawarma on a pita is delicious! I have been there with my friends and my boyfriend numerous times. My other favorite is their falafel - it is crunchy and the tahini sauce compliments all their dishes. I have yet to find another middle eastern fast food restaurant as good as this one! Hats off to all the chefs especially JOE!"}
{"text":"Best damn shawarma I've ever had! Been coming to this place since my Sister introduced me to it and have been coming back since, if im in the mood for shawarma. Not to mention they have pretty good kebabs, burgers, fries and Tzatiki sauce!"}

{"text":"Really good and filling ... cute and very fast. They cook stuff fresh. It's not that expensive which is good. There swarms very good there yoo"}
{"text":"More like 2.37±0.05 stars...

Typed in \"shawarma\" on Yelp. I was intrigued by a white-washed shawarma place called \"Joe's Hamburgers\" so I had to check it out. 

I ordered the chicken shawarma. While chicken quality was alright, pita bread and toppings were meh, surely overpriced. I have had bigger & tastier shawarmas for much less. Service was alright. Some employees seem to have serious attitude issues.

I came with very low expectations yet somehow I was disappointed."}
{"text":"Me and my mother ordered takeout and brought it home. We had a Lamb Kebab plate, a Chicken Shawarma plate, a 4oz cheeseburger and Falafel 

Overall impression: 

Everything tasted good 

However I'm not really sure where everyone is getting the massive portion sizes from ? 

My lamb kebab plate was a tiny kebab with maybe 5 small cube pieces of lamb and a giant mound of rice to cover up for the lack of meat. For 20+ dollars after tax it was not worth it. 

Similar was my chicken shawarma plate, maybe a handful of chicken and massive amount of rice. Like yea rice is nice but I am not paying for rice, I'm paying a price in which I would expect a healthy amount of chicken. 

Burger was good, no complaints 

Falafel was good no complaints 

Dishes came with salads which were fine (who can mess up a salad) 

Overall everything tasted great but for what I paid and the amount of meat I ended up receiving, I was really frustrated. Ive paid 5 dollars less for shawarma plates and received I'd say more than 4 times the amount of meat on a consistent basis at pita golden pocket. 

I'd come back for the bigger burgers only if I was in the area or else not worth the money."}
{"text":"All the co-workers are addicted to Joe's, my colleague next to me has been in twice this week already. Bring an empty stomach and make sure you have an extra hole in your belt cause you're gonna need it! 

Chicken shawarma plate comes with choice of rice or fries, an enormous Greek salad with tons of yummy fet on top and tzatziki sauce on the side. I enjoyed this dish very much! Outstanding flavour, made to order! 

Prices I'm gonna admit are a little on the high side, however their food is five stars so at least they have that to back it up and I left with a full stomach."}
{"text":"Best shawarma and burgers in the area!! Sometimes they get insanely busy, but are good about letting you know the wait if you are in a rush. The shawarma pita, salad, and burgers are huge! Get the pita with \"everything hot\"."}
{"text":"Chicken Shawarma Dinner is perfect here! Very filling and satisfying. Parking kind of sucks around here, sometimes it's too busy."}
{"text":"To be honest, I only ended up here because my original plans of going to MiNe (a popular sushi restaurant next door) for dinner had failed. The wait times for MiNe were way too long and I am naturally a very impatient person... So I walked next door and was instantly drawn towards the chicken shawarma signs. And what an awesome decision it was to enter! 

Joe's Hamburgers was delicious and also really filling. I probably ended up spending a small fraction of what I would've at MiNe with the same satisfaction. I tried the regular hamburger as well as the chicken shawarma and neither of these dishes disappointed - both came in large portions and were very flavourful and fresh. This place is a nice and quick restaurant where you order and pay at the counter with the option of sitting in, as there are many tables all around. It could be great for a casual outing with your family or even a date! Would definitely recommend when you're craving for a juicy burger or a chicken shawarma."}
{"text":"I was craving for a hotdog and my BF was craving for a shawarma, so we thought we'd try this place out, as it seems to be the perfect choice at the moment due to good reviews, and it's a family run business.

When we came in there were quite a few people ahead of us, and when it was our turn to order, the cashier JUST LEFT THE CASH and started preparing food. So we had to wait for a few minutes before one of their staff saw us and took our orders. They are CLEARLY understaffed.

I got the hotdog for $4 and my BF got a chicken shawarma.

I saw them put the hotdog in the microwave and then later placed on the grill get have \"grill marks\". The chicken shawarma is huge and my BF can't finish it. Can't go wrong with their shawarma, as it's always good quality and you get a very good portion all the time.

Whenever we come here, there is always such a long wait for food to be prepared, and I don't like it that most of the time, there is no one attending the cash. After I ate, I wanted to get another drink and I had to wait a few minutes for someone to notice me waiting at the cashier station, while the other staff just sat down and ate their own lunches, talk to their guests, and make food.

I have always been disappointed at their slow service, and they pay little attention to the cash.

If you want to get quick service, I suggest calling ahead, as you can't just walk in and out from this place, you will be here a while due to slow service. I will come back, but with much lower expectations on service."}
{"text":"Summary: schwarma done right. Good taste, big portion, solid value, amazing service. Downside? Chicken schwarma only (no beef), and limited parking can be an issue, but we've always made it work.

Note to self: Sam, you gotta try the lamb next.

Joe's Hamburgers is a mainstay for our ball hockey team after games, provided we don't end too late. It's a little gem that closes at 9, so we don't come as much as we want.

The schwarma dinner is what I always go for, and that makes me unadventurous, I know. But it is fairly substantial sized, and makes for a hearty meal with rice, salad, meat freshly cut off the roast, and if you ask, a pita as well.

Service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"This restaurant alone makes me want to live in Richmond Hill. Staff are friendly, service is fast (for the amount of people that are in there!), and area is clean. The food portions make me feel satisfied and in love with life. I had the shawarma dinner for lunch and the salad was very fresh (I hate veg but I loved the salad), fries were delectable and I could eat that chicken for days! I love this place. So glad I work near here! Prices are definitely reasonable."}
{"text":"I'd describe this place as very comfort food-y american style diner.

The food was good, with all wholesome ingredients and stuff.

It was okay IMO. I got the shawarma, which was huge, but not my favourite.

I got the soulaki dinner with extra salad instead of rice for my carb-avoiding brother and he seemed to like it. 

They did give me a ton of turnips when I asked for some on the side.
++++++
I fucking love turnips."}
{"text":"This place was packed when we went and we ordered the chicken shawarma dinner and a burger.  Burger was nothing special but the shawarma was delicious with the hand but fries. Portions are huge and you may have a tough time finishing."}
{"text":"I would like to give them a 5 for the food. It is great! But lately they have been forgetting orders. Today I ordered chicken souvlaki dinner with a large lentil soup. They forgot my lentil soup after I asked the girl at the counter if everything was in my takeout bag and she said yes. So I went back and demanded that give me a free chicken as by the time I got home mine was cold. They gave me my soup and the chicken at no charge of course but no apology and the girl had the audacity to tell me not to give HER attitude! Are you kidding me? I drove all the way back to get the food I PAID for! Joe if you're reading this you need new staff that are competent and empathetic!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful and the food is even better. Joe and his family love food and the people here make it with love. You can taste it. I especially enjoy the shawarma and souvlaki meals which fill me up for about two days. I should also add that the owners of this little place care deeply about the people in their local community and donate their time, energy and even resources to hosting community groups. There is alot of good karma going on here and you can feel that too. If you want a down home meal in Richmond Hill that is consistently tasty and filling, I recommend you check it out. Tell Joe that Mike sent you. He'll know what you mean!"}
{"text":"Best burger I have had in s long time ! Very clean, friendly and outgoing service! This my new go to burger place"}
{"text":"Killer burgers and even better fries. Best Burger in Richmond Hill along with Fresh Burger. Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"I kind of love this place.

It's a kind of fabulous mash-up between a diner and a fingerlicking falafel joint. I've never tried the burgers here since the Pitas and Dinner plate combos are immeasurably delicious, but the fries are pretty crunchy if you're in the mood for American.  

Although evenings can get weirdly busy, they are well staffed and you can be sure to get your order between 5-10 minutes. I agree with Eric about the tables being randomly dirty, however, in their defense Joe's is very busy for a secluded diner and there are plenty of tables to choose from.

On my visits, I've tried the Chicken Shawarma dinner plate ($11, with fries and greek salad) and the Falafel combo ($8, with fries and pop) and the portions are gigantic. The chicken was tender and soft, and my falafel was very fresh. I found that my food was less greasy than your usual diner fare, and much more fresh. 

No wonder there's always a line up."}
{"text":"Busy but good place for falafa, shawrama and it has halal options in the menu"}
{"text":"I finally tried this place after hearing about t from a friend several times.  I do like shawarma and try new places when ever I can.  This place is clean and the staff are friendly.  The shawarma was good but not the best I've ever tried.  I'd come back next I'm in the area for sure."}
{"text":"Now that I have started eating here more often, I think I am building an addiction to their Chicken Shwarma. Sooooo good! Everything on the menu by our experience is quite good. Wife loves the souvlaki. With the burgers and fish added in, there are plenty of choices to keep the whole family happy. Very friendly staff, and lots of them to handle the rush. A busy place."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon Joe's with an after work craving of souvlaki. I went with a lamb souvlaki dinner to go and was not disappointed. The meat was cooked medium as I requested and it was soft and juicy. This definitely hit the spot and I hope to return to try their infamous shwaramas as reviewed by fellow Yelpers"}
{"text":"My hubby and I ordered from Joe's when we grew tired of the local hamburger offerings in our area. Little did we realize that Joe's had been sitting under our noses for years!

We have ordered twice so far - first time we both had the Big Joe's Burger combo. Warning: do not order unless you are really, really hungry because it is a lot of food and you will be very, very full. The fries are delicious - well seasoned, crisp, and yummy. You can tell they are homemade fries - super enjoyable. Now as for the burger we both chose to have it with cheese and bacon (I would recommend it that way) plus all available toppings. Phew - just thinking of that burger is making me feel full. Now, to be forewarned Joe's does cook their burgers very well done but I completely understand why. So if that turns you off, maybe you should find another burger joint. However, if you are still with me, then you will find that the burger is very well seasoned and has a lot of flavour. The toppings were all very fresh and delicious. All in all this burger combo was dynamite and I would much rather come to Joe's than any of the other fast food spots or diner style places. When you consider the prices at Joe's and the speed of the food - it really cannot be beat.

Now, second time around I felt like trying the Falafel in pita combo. It was awesome. Again the toppings in the pita were phenomenal and the falafel were very crisp and really tasty. I would recommend this combo to anyone looking for a lighter option to the Big Joe's burger combo.

To wrap things up I would say this: if you are looking for higher quality food for lower prices and more options Joe's Hamburgers is a must. However, if you are stuck on having your burgers done medium or so, then carry on looking. 

Update: Now that I have had the shawarma in a pita I can tell you that it is amazing. So tasty and delicious plus you can order it with a variety of toppings and sauces to make it your own. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Amazing shwarma! It's the best I've had in
the city! Generous portion, great flavour, and your choice of fillings.  Definitely try this place if you are in the neighbourhood looking for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love Sharwarma & burger at the same place ?! Yessss pleaseeee! 

This cozy local restaurant hits both the sharwarma and hamburger sectors! When you first walk in, the place is pretty spacious and you are promptly greeted by the cashier. I LOVE the huge television screens! The furniture weren't the most comfortable but pretty decent for a fast takeout restaurant. 

Chicken Shish-kabob in a pita - the portion was pretty good! I managed to finish it. I LOVE how the kabob was made fresh! No food sitting in a warmer... just freshly made food! LOVE it!  The chicken was very tasty and tender ! Love all the veggies which came with it. The tahini sauce was a good addition to the pita. The only thing I would add next time is some hot sauce. After that the pita will definitely be out-of-this-world! Overall, pretty good pita! 4.5/5 

Service - it's a DIY system. You order then wait for your food. After you get your food , you sit wherever you want. Make sure you clean up after yourself! Everything is pretty much self serve which I didn't mind. The cashiers/chefs were pretty nice. 

Final verdict ? I would definitely come back again ! I love this place !"}
{"text":"Probably only 2 years ago that I found out about this and ever since I've been hooked on  Joe's Burgers. This place is the place to go for a Shawarma + Burgers. And I literally mean those exact words. You have to get that combination or else your missing out on everything is place is made of. 

The best way to try the two out and have best of both worlds is if you go with your family, friend or whoever but as long as you both order a shawarma for yourself and share a burger between you two ( depends on how many people you bring that is, you may end up needing to buy an extra burger *YUM*) 

The chicken Shawarma which is usually my personal favorite, its made with 'LOVE' and I strongly emphasize that. The chicken is very juicy and tender, and when they pack the pita with the salad, coleslaw, sauce and the chicken it is just amazing. They pack it so good that there's really no empty space, and majority of the time its overflowing with all the ingredients. I'd say its better than not having enough like some other places.  Every bite has so much flavor, I really enjoy that they put in coleslaw because it gives the shawarma extra taste and I personally really like it with chicken.

The Burger is also very good, in my opinion I prefer the shawarma more, just because burgers are very standard. There's alot of places where you can get a burger besides here but  what I do enjoy about's Joe's is the size of the burger which is larger than other burger joints. Also the burgers are made like \"harvey's style\" where you can see them flipping the paties and them asking you what you want on your burger and such. The burger is also very good tasting , I enjoy it but it's not something that I would ever crave or go out of my way for. Again, it's just the size of the burger which makes a good seller, taste wise I would only consider it normal. 

The only thing about this place that i'm not really a fan of is the wait time. It's understandable that they are pretty busy usually with all the take out orders and it's a family business as well, but every time i've gone I had to wait quite extensively. Not something I would turn myself away from coming back here but I would hope they can implement a better system in the future to speed up the wait time for their beloved customers."}
{"text":"This place was not good at all. 

1) awful schawerma, only chicken, they don't even have beef schawerma!!!
2) absolutely flavourless!!! Typical westernized food.
3) who eats tzaziki with schawerma?!? I asked for tahini and the response I get is  \"extra $1.30!\"...EXTRA?!?! TAHINI IS A STAPLE FOR SCHAWERMA!!! 

I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Favourite family restaurant in Richmond hill. Joe is a family man who knows all of his customers and makes a point to give you service with a smile. Ask anybody there what they like the most about this place they will tell you the food is great but the people are even better."}

{"text":"Ordered the sharwama dinner plate and falafel in a pita, absolutely delicious and good portions altho a little price for example the sharwama was $12.75 and the falafel was $9 for a combo with fries and a drink....will need to come back to try their burgers"}

{"text":"This is a good place to eat quality food, but it is quite pricey. Its a great shawarma dinner but when you're paying about 20$ and that doesn't include a drink it really does add up. Definitely a place to go to just not too often, as it is pricey for a fast food place."}
{"text":"I had the chicken souvalaki dinner last night. I got takeout and I only had to wait about 10 minutes as my chicken was getting grilled. I really liked the chicken and rice. The salad could have been better. There were too many big chunks of lettuce. The lettuce portion of the salad need improvement. The dinner was $12.40+ tax.

I will be back to try the shawarma and the burgers."}
{"text":"I've eaten burgers all around and recently came across this place.... If your looking for a beefy tasting burger with a perfect bun that actually fits the burger and is toasted perfect every time and has just the perfect softness this is ur place. 
Best burger by far around these parts. 
There are many burger stops around here but nothing compares this one. The joes big burger is the one I get!!
The prices are decent won't break the bank. The portions are huge and good to share if ur looking for a light meal. 
I am also a lover of tatziki sauce... All I can say is yum yum yum... If your a garlic lover this is a must have. The small container is never enough. And they make it with yogurt not like some places that make it with sour cream so you don't have to feel as bad eating so much of it lol
Only complaint is the wait time.... If u walk in an order u will be waiting a good 20mins for ur food. It's a good thing cause you know it's fresh but still the wait is a bit much sometimes. But this also being cause there are so busy ALL THE TIME!! 
Best bet call your order in for pick up! 
One last thing the fries are not the frozen kind also a must try!! Everything is excellent the chicken to mmmmm.... 
I could dine here every day! :)"}
{"text":"No matter what I order here the food is good. It's a great local choice if you want anything from burger to salad, falafel to shawarma. 
They will be seeing me often, and soon. :)"}
{"text":"This place has very good food, decently priced. Best falafel. Great chicken dinner (half rice, half fries)."}
{"text":"I'm not local so I've only been to Joe's twice but both times were tasty and worthy of telling others on Yelp! I'm a self proclaimed falafel connoisseur and I absolutely loved this place. It's a little different than other pita places because they serve a combo with fries. The fries were perfect and unsalted allowing me to salt to taste. They use the small, stuffable round pitas and filled them generously with falafel. The falafel balls were flavourful and crispy and there were more than enough.  Good assortment of veggies, too. If memory serves me, the garlic sauce has dairy so other vegans beware. 100% recommend!"}
{"text":"Update: the food quality is still great, but that have increased their prices by about 20% which doesn't make it as worth it as it used to be. Service takes a while, but that's what you expect with any good place. They would get a 5 star rating if they brought their prices back to the old days."}
{"text":"Can't really go wrong with anything at Joe's. The souvlaki, shawarma and burgers are all great options that deliver in quality and quantity. I usually opt for a shawarma salad, something somewhat unique to this establishment. Their tzatziki sauce is excellent and they make a very flavourful chili sauce as well."}
{"text":"Joe's food is always amazing. Reasonable pricing. Order ahead of time to save a wait as this place is always packed. Again, great food."}
{"text":"This is the place I miss most since I moved from Richmond Hill to Downtown T.O.

It is a quirky blend of burgers, greek chicken and lamb souvlaki, and middle eastern shwarma and falafel - but what a great blend it is!

I love the chicken souvlaki on a pita - especially with the great coleslaw that is one of the many toppings.  The falafel in a pita is also really good.

The lamb souvlaki dinner is only good if you dine in... not recommended for take out.

Like others have said, if you are doing take out at lunch or dinner, call ahead, the place gets busy, but that is because the food is great.

And Joe is a sweet guy - it is great to see nice people doing well.

Almost forgot - the lentil soup is really good too!"}
{"text":"Ah Joe's, another hidden gem. It's easy to miss Joe's due to its location, but loyal fans know where it is by heart. 

I've been going to Joe's for quite some time, and I am pleased to say the quality has been consistent throughout the years. 

Joe's has also recently renovated their space so it looks a lot better than before. My go to item every single time is the falafel in a whole wheat pita. When you order, there usually is a bit of a wait time, but they have become increasingly faster over the years. Once your fresh, crispy falafel is made, you can choose all the fixings' to your heart's content! Caramelized onions, cabbage, lettuce, tomato, hot peppers...customize to your liking and top with your choice of tahini, hot sauce or garlic sauce (or all 3). At around $10, it truly makes the perfect meal, lunch or dinner...

So filling, and very satisfying. Every time I visit, I'm hungry for more. I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Best joes big burgers and quality is excellent my son cannot get enough chicken souvlaki and the shawarma is yum but often sells out ..."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place because of the reviews.. I got beef kabob dinner (comes with rice and salad).. and I got 6 Falafels on the side. My friend had the chicken shawarma on a pita. The beef kabob barely had any flavor.. I should of followed my instinct and got it at a Real Middle Eastern Restaurant.. where it is tender and flavorful.. I'm sorry but his one Lacked Flavor but it was fresh.. which is good! But I was so craving that tender flavorful beef kabob and I did not get it! I didn't even finish it.. I took a bite and got turned off because my craving wasn't satisfied! The falafel was good! The garlic sauce was okay, nothing special. Now.. I took my friends chicken shawarma on a pita.. that I can admit was good.. although I would prefer more toppings on mine.. we ended up trading because he saw how irritated I was, that I didn't get my craving satisfied.. so he sacrificed.. Smiley Face.  Yip, good friend indeed! I got the Al Juice in pomegranate flavor and I didn't like it much. This place isn't bad.. but it's just not for me.. I wouldn't recommend it personally.. but you can try it for yourself. Customer service was very good and friendly and she gave me recommendations.. but these stars are based on the food."}
{"text":"Joe's Hamburgers' burgers are pretty good... not the best I had but just watching my beef patty grilling in open flame... exciting!!

1/4 lb combo ($7.55) with a choice of drink. I got excited again when the nice man behind the cash said how about a beer?! Of course.. the drink is just a choice of pop..

My DC must be really hungry since he finished his 1/2 lb in lighting speed... and then start attacking all the home cut fries and onion rings....until everything is gone!! Maybe is the Cherry Cola he is drinking giving him this sugar rush....

The burger is quite enjoyable as the meat is moist and seasoned well. However, the Chicken Souvlaki with grilled marks looks a lot more tempting!! I definitely will be ordering that when I come back next time!

PS They should definitely has the staffs wiped down the table frequently... seems no one ever clean the table the whole time we are there!!"}
{"text":"Went back for our usual chicken shawarma and chicken shish kabob this time with my son who ordered the 2 piece fish and chips and every almost all of it - he didn't finish the fries but we did that for him :)"}
{"text":"The best food in Richmond Hill. Try the lentil soup, and lamb beef combo. Delicious and healthy . Joe and Waffa you guys are the best in the west and north. Enzo"}
{"text":"Great shawarma every-time we come here and the lamb is superb. great atmosphere and the prices are good. I have yet to come by this place and it isn't packed with customers."}
{"text":"Nothing too special about the food. Good shwarma but the rice is just plain yellow rice and the fries are average. The pitas are always good - I like it extra saucey!"}
{"text":"Really good shawarma. Great serving size as well. Always leave full and wanting to return again!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best places in Richmond Hill. It's a shame i only discovered this place after living in Richmond Hill for so long... but better late than never!

I highly recommend the Chicken Sharwama dinner plate. Not only is the portion size very generous, the chicken is incredibly tender and seasoned perfectly. Probably one of the best dinner plates i've tasted.

Highly recommend!"}
