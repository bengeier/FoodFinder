{"text":"My favorite pizza. I grew up on Rosie's and when I'm back in town I need to get some. I think the secret is the family tradition and those crazy old ovens."}
{"text":"Pizza is great especially when right out the oven ( arrive a few min. Before time they give you)  me and my daughter like to take plates and napkins and eat it in the car in the parking lot a block away! Prices are inexpensive. Mr. Personality makes one hell of a pie!"}
{"text":"I've been eating this pizza since I was 5 years old! Every time I come to visit family - we have to get Rosie's! I highly suggest the deluxe pizza- delicious!"}
{"text":"This was my favorite pizza as a kid, my sister used to live right down the street.... The susage is legend. Sadly I have not had one in about ten years. I have heard that Rosie no longer runs the place. Think I might have to grab one this week and find out if it is as good as I remember.... Fingers crossed it is and I can make this review five stars once I do #nostalgia"}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza place in the Cleveland Area. I actually grew up near this place. This place buys as much of the items locally as possible, and prepares the dough fresh daily. You have to get there early for the pie though, when they sell the number of pizzas they determine for the day; they close. And the demand is great!   The pizzas are round with a raised crust. None of the thin crust/ multi cross cut pizzas like in the major chains. Still owned by the same family as when I was a kid. I've had many a works pizza growing up, and the taste is still the same as when i was a kid."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza, great crispy crust and the sauce has a little kick to it that really makes it special to me, quality toppings and cheese. I moved away from Lorain 20 years ago, but when in town I make sure to get a pizza from Rosie's. BTW the large pizza is about 12\" so if you expect a bigger pizza order two and enjoy the leftovers."}
{"text":"Rosie's pizza is delicious. The crust was not doughy and baked just right. The pizza sauce is on the sweeter side but has a hint of black pepper which gives the flavoring of the pizza a nice kick! The cheese makes this pizza outstanding. It's is not stringy and tastes delicious. I wish it would stick to the crust more. The toppings are generous. Overall, great taste. The size of the large pizza was definitely on the smaller side for the price you pay. The taste of the pizza made up for the lack size. The location is not the fanciest but, hey, \"holes in the walls\" have the best food!"}
{"text":"This review is solely based on Rosie's Customer Service or lack thereof ..I haven't had this place in years so once I made it to Lorain i had to have it...I called to order and was greeted by the rudest person in Pizza Ordering history..He seemed as if his job was to make me not want this delicious pizza. (To make a long story short)..I opted for another local establishment on the other side of town who had nice people working and answering the phone"}
{"text":"This pizza is my favorite. They cover the pizza in lots of toppings. My family grew up in Lorain . I live near Cleveland now but when I am in the area I will always try to grab a pizza. Now I have to say Rosie's son or grandson(I am not sure)who now runs the place is never in a nice or polite mood but I love the pizza so I still go even though you would think someone who runs a shop would at least smile and treat customers nicely. If you like mushrooms, the pie will be covered, the sauce is tasty (sometimes a little spicy). If in the area grab a pie. The place is a little run down and needs some upkeep as it looks like it has not been updated in probably 20 or more years but the pizza is great. They are in the stone ages though as They also only take cash no credit cards (even though every other mom and pop shop, fast food restaurant etc take credit cards). 5 stars for the pizza (1 star for the atmosphere and crappy attitude but it's a carry out joint in Lorain so I don't judge the restaurant on that unless I dine in)."}
{"text":"Omg... I guess Rosie's pizza is on it's way out of business! Back in the day, Rosie's pizza was the \"bomb\"! Of lately, the pizza is okay... But they have definitely lost the pizzzazz... The hospitality has become absolutely horrendous, there's no welcoming spirit that was there, back in the day. The ppl who have inherited Rosie's have no hospitality & act like making pizza has become an absolute \"chore\"! #UnsatisfiedCustomer #Sad"}
{"text":"Generous toppings and nice crust.  The sauce is sweet and the cheese is gooey.  I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"At one time this was the place to get a pizza in lorain. Sadly that time has passed. These grossly overpriced pies are a let down in every way. The cheese barely covers the sauce and the frozen tasting toppings are skimped on as well. 12 bucks for a large pepperoni. I could have bought two Digiorno pizzas and had a better meal!   Dont waste your money, Rosie's is garbage."}
{"text":"Rosies is a Lorain staple. Jay Lute has kept the family tradition going. You will not be disappointed. Best 20 minute wait!"}
