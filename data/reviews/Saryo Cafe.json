{"text":"Loved their Saryo signature parfait! Strong matcha taste for the soft serve. Mochi was soft and chewy, and the matcha brownie was also delicious. Everything paired nicely and I'll definitely be back to try their matcha latte."}
{"text":"Came here after eating at konjiki ramen (shared space). Go for the matcha soft serve. I didn't care for the fancier dessert. Matcha brownie was dry (not sure if this is how it's supposed to be and the extra jellies/balls were meh compared to what I have had in the same neighbourhood. The lattes were okay for the price. The matcha soft serve is what pushes this place to 4 stars for me. I'll be back, but just for that."}
{"text":"Great Japanese style cafe to fulfill you matcha needs! We ordered the matcha latte, hojicha latte, matcha rare cheesecake, and the matcha walnut brownie.
The matcha latte was really nice and smooth, it had a great matcha flavour to it and some sweetness to balance it out. It's probably one of the sweeter drinks on the menu.
The hojicha latte, on the other hand, is very strong and has an almost chocolate/coffee flavour to it. It tasted very smooth and creamy with less sugar than the matcha. I'd describe the hojicha latte as the adult and brooding version of the matcha.
The matcha rare cheesecake was quite soft and fluffy. It wasn't too sweet and came with a little scoop of red bean paste. It was a really nice light dessert!
The matcha walnut brownie had a great texture to it, likely because of the walnuts. I really love walnuts in any dessert, so I'm a little bias with this one. However, the brownie had much less of a distinct matcha flavour than the cheesecake.
Overall, great place for some nice desserts, although seating is a bit limited. Luckily, most people seem to come here for Konjiki Ramen, which shares the space with Saryo."}
{"text":"First time here. It's really busy today maybe is long weekend. We order one of their signature parfait and one chestnut cake. 

The ice cream is EXTREMELY SWEET! We can Barely taste the tea favourite. And I have no idea why they put a crazy amount of granola in the middle of the parfait... we are not satisfied of that at all. The jelly at the bottom is tasteless. Even though it looks to be green tea favourite. 

The cake is alright. Not strong chestnut favourite as I expected. The crust is dry. 

Overall. I won't come back anymore. Btw, they're background music is way louder that we cannot listen to each other"}
{"text":"I was actually a little confused at first when I was here since both of Saryo and Konjiki share the same space. Saryo is similar to Tsujiri and specializes in matcha desserts. I'm not a huge fan of Matcha so I opted for their Hojicha flavoured soft serve parfait waffle bowl. And it was the bomb! The Hojicha flavour is very rich and creamy. The waffle is also very delicious! I think I devoured the whole thing in less than a minute. It comes with red beans, gluttonous rice balls and jellies. Their menu is very limited compared to Tsujiri but I'm looking forward to trying their house-made cakes next time!"}
{"text":"Saw all the great review and we so happened to pass by this place and it didn't disappointment me. No too many selection and the menu is only 1 page
Picked the Matcha Amitsu Bowl, it's super good ice-cream, very rich in matcha flavour with mochi and red bean paste and jelly. Next time when I come, I will actually stop for ramen and have dessert after. There are other items I would love to try"}
{"text":"Saryo Cafe shares the same space with Konjiki Ramen; it is located at the front where Konjiki is at the back. Saryo is a famous Japanese cafe specializes in matcha desserts and beverages. I was still hungry after I had Konjiki, so I hopped into Saryo to have a dessert. I ordered Saryo Signature Parfait, which is basically a dessert with a little bit of everything. As much as I love their soft serve, I did not like anything else. I found the parfait had too much cream and granola, I also found the jellies were tasteless. I also think it is a little bit pricy for a cup of ice cream, however, it seems like this is a normal price for ice cream nowadays.

Food: Saryo Signature Parfait * matcha soft serve ice-cream with house-made matcha brownie, hojicha cream, granola, red bean, mocha, green tea & water jelly * $7.5

{"text":"YUM!
I came here after having ramen at Konjiki and I was not disappointed. My boyfriend and I shared a hojicha Saryo signature parfait and it was just the perfect balance of everything. I'm just re-imagining the creamy silky texture and roasted flavour of the hojicha soft serve now, paired with chewy mochi, a sweet kick of red bean, crumbly matcha brownie, crunchy granola, smooth hojicha cream, and soft jelly... MMM.. I want it again!

I mean, this parfait was a meal in itself - I'd say it's perfect for a midday snack on a hot summer day! However, if I'm coming after a meal, I think next time I'd go with just the hojicha soft serve on its own. Thanks to this cafe, this is definitely now one of my favourite places for ice cream."}
{"text":"Great customer service experience! Clean cute store but didnt realize it was connected to the popular ramen place at the back - there was a massive line and i thought people were crazy for lining up for icecream in -25 degrees haha. Had the signature parfait w/ hojicha icecream takeout!"}
{"text":"Ever since Tsujiri opened up, feels like a lot of copy cats are opening their own, or had the idea to bring over a brand from Japan. To me, it's ok. As long as you do a good job I don't mind buying from a copy cat. Saryo is a 2 in 1 shop with ramen (Konjiki) and the Saryo caf√©. This review is for Saryo.

I'm a matcha fiend and have to politely disagree with all the other reviewers praising Saryo's matcha. It really doesn't compare with Tsujiri. Tsujiri has a much longer history of doing matcha and Saryo's matcha is simply not the same grade. High quality matcha is supposed to have a subtle sweetness in addition to a slight bitter taste. Too bitter does not mean it's better. Saryo's matcha soft serve is simply not as pronounced and lacks that subtle sweetness I would expect. The texture is also a bit more runny than I would like. 

Also, their selection is much smaller than Tsujiri and most of the pastry items are a notch worse than Tsujiri. 

Customer service wise, I can't get over one of their servers. It's a guy named Taiki I think. Horrible service. If you want good matcha drinks and desserts, definitely go to Tsujiri instead. Prices are about the same but you get less quality at Saryo. I might try their houjicha as that seems to get a lot of praise."}
{"text":"Fast service and very delicious desserts. Some people may find the portions to be small if you are used to North American portions but I thought it was just right. Had the Matcha amitsu bowl and it was delicious! Had a good balance of ingredients and the Matcha flavor was nice and strong. Red beans, mochi, and jelly give you variety in texture. 

A delicious way to end the night after dinner somewhere else in the area.

Seating here is scarce though and it is not good for groups."}
{"text":"Amazing, amazing, amazing! I had my heart set on the hojicha (roasted green tea) waffle bowl. Even though the cashier was in the beginning was trying to promote hojicha over matcha (green tea leaves finely grounded into powder vs roasted green tea), I did not need any kind of convincing at all. It honestly just looks like chocolate but I really had no idea what it might taste like, knowing what I know.

About the dessert I had: it came with 2 mochi balls which were chewy and bouncy, hojicha ice cream, with red beans, and jellies which I am 95% sure made of agar. It was all in all a very simplistic yet aesthetic dessert. The hojicha was deep, and rich in a \"smoky\" way...if I can put an analogy to it. It's a very unique taste and I highly recommend trying it over  matcha. Don't get me wrong, matcha is tasty but it is totally overhyped. Move over matcha, there's a new hojicha in town!

I would recommend ordering desserts here that aren't too similar to Tsujiri. For example, I steered clear of their sundaes because I don't think it would be that much different. Sayro also sells some chocolates on the side and they offer cake slices like mont blanc (will try next time), strawberry shortcake etc.  I bought some matcha brownies to take home because why not? I am glad I made that decision because it was the tastiest and the only matcha brownie I ever had: moist, slightly sweet and balanced, with some pieces of nuts. 

I am in love and will be a regular, I predict at this place. Another quick comment, the cashier was very friendly as well and welcoming. Bonus points for that!"}
{"text":"This is just based on their houjicha sundae but wow it was amazing! The houjicha flavor was very strong and there was a very nice roasted flavor, it went really well with the azuki beans and dango. Probably the best houjicha soft serve I've had! What they offer is similar to tsujiri but I have to try their matcha to compare."}
{"text":"This dessert place is inside the extremely popular Konjiki Ramen. They have their own small seating area if you want to dine in. I went around 6pm on a weeknight and didn't have to wait to order. I got the houjicha soft serve and thought it was just average...it tasted more like a mix of chocolate ice cream and houjicha than just houjicha. It also looked grainier (less smooth) than other houjicha soft serves I've tried.

Update: Upgrading rating from 3 to 4 stars. Tried their houjicha latte and it was quite good. No weird chocolate flavour (maybe that was an off day?). Strong houjicha taste and very smooth. Will come back to try their matcha soft serve one day."}
{"text":"Saryo Cafe is in the same location as Konjiki Ramen. They probably take up a third of the entire space and have limited seats with most bar table style. My friends finished lunch at Konjiki before heading over for dessert. 

We ordered the hojicha latte and was pleasantly surprised. The taste for hojicha has an enhanced flavour over matcha.  FOr those who are not familiar with hojicha, it is a further process to roast the matcha leaves to gives a new flavour while maintaining some matcha taste. Although they were having problems with their soft ice cream machine, we had a little sample for free and it was amazing.

We also order some cheesecake but found that the cheese overpowered the matcha and hojicha flavour. If you definitely pass by Sayro Cafe, definitely order a latte or soft ice cream with hojicha flavour."}
{"text":"I was so excited to hear that Saryo (a famous dessert cafe in Japan) had opened up their first outpost outside of Japan in North York. Saryo is a small cafe, technically located at the same address as another famous Japanese restaurant outpost, Konjiki. The cafe has only 5 barstools and 2 chairs, but there is room for a few more to stand at the side of the bartop areas.

Like nearby Tsujiri, the dessert cafe specializes in green tea beverages and desserts (including matcha and houjicha parfaits, sundaes, and soft serve ice cream). I love that the flavour of the matcha and houjicha soft serves is quite pronounced (probably my current favourite of the various matcha cafes now in the GTA). 

My friend and I ordered the signature parfait ($7.50), but while she got hers with matcha soft serve (as it comes), I requested mine to be made with houjicha soft serve. The whipped cream is houjicha flavoured as well. Plain and matcha anmitsu (agar jelly), shiratama, toasted oat cereal, and sweetened red beans add texture and visual interest to the parfait. My friend and I both found the oats to be overly crunchy and in over abundance, and would have preferred a flaked cereal to be added instead for crunchy texture. 

So when houjicha desserts are present, why stop at only one? We also ordered the houjicha cheesecake. For some reason it took a while for the staff to plate and prepare this cake slice for us, and my friend was halfway done her parfait and had to remind the staff that she had ordered the cheesecake before they prepared it.  Despite having a nice soft cheesecake texture, the houjicha cheesecake lacked the roasted tea flavour we were both looking forward to. The cheesecake had more of a chocolate flavour than that of houjicha, which was a bit of a letdown.

Overall I was impressed enough by the strong matcha and houjicha soft serve to give this place 4 stars, and would happily return to have more of this as well as try some of the beverage offerings."}
{"text":"Had my hearty bowl of ramen in the co-located ramen shop, the world famous Konjiki in town. Wanted to add a little finishing touch to the meal, so I had to try that dessert place Saryo right outside. And so I did - ramen had me quite full already so I didn't opt for anything crazy.. just a soft serve in a cup. Boy, they charge the same amount as Tsujiri but provides less than half of the ice cream for the same price. Is this reverse boxing day deal or something? Tastes the same as Tsujiri but half the content.. I think I'll opt for paying $6 to Tsujiri for my dollars worth."}
{"text":"Matcha soft serve is the way to go! It is very rich in flavour. While the hojicha flavour is not as common, it is not as rich as I'd like. Maybe because I had it in a sundae with the mochi balls and red bean, it kind of took away the flavour of the hojicha :/ 
I wish they had an option where you could do a twist and get both flavours."}
{"text":"The real intention was to give konjiki a try but as a retired foodie, I would be remiss not to give saryo dessert a try.  It's a typical Japanese place where everything aesthetically is on point. It was an awfully cold afternoon so I did not opt for the soft serve but instead took a gamble on the matcha cheesecake. I got it to go since I already finished my ramen and didn't want to sit back down in the smallish restaurant and the parking meter outside is running. As with a typical Japanese place, they boxed it up and put it in a nice card stock bag as if you bought a nice watch at a department store.  Attention to detail is somewhat missing as they did not provide a fork and napkin until they were asked. It's a new place so I'll cut them some slack. Upon returning to the car, I excitedly stuck my fork thru the cheesecake, and my excitement fizzled immediately.  Right off the bat I knew the texture of the cake is totally off. The texture is very spongie which is an extreme foreign texture for both a western and or a Japanese cheesecake. It's a texture that's closer to a cheap Chinese bakery mousse cake where the patissier realized that gelatin was on a mega sale at the supermarket and decided that the consumers deserved more of it. In addition the matcha was very lackluster. The taste was bland and definitely lacked the slightly bitter after taste of high quality matcha. At this price point and portion I expected a lot more quality. I can't speak to the soft serve but I hope that it's justifying the hype. Given the need to pay for parking and that a lineup is inevitable at regular hours, I think it's the last time I'll visit saryo."}
{"text":"**3.5 rating**

This cafe is situated inside the same building as Konjiki Ramen, that specializes in matcha (similar to Tsujuri) There's limited seating inside but you can easily grab a drink (or even ice cream) while you wait in line for ramen. My friend got the Matcha Black Sugar Latte. For $5, I found it overpriced for what it was, but the taste was alright...nothing special. I got the Saryo Signature Parfait. I asked them if they were able to do a twist of Matcha and Hojicha and they said twist wasn't available but also they ran out of Matcha. When I asked if they can substitute there's bean for the oiri- japanese soft candy rice ball (interested to see what it taste like), they said no. Fine. It was $7.50 plus tax which was a tad expensive but I guess it's standard pricing compared to like, Tsujuri. The hojicha soft serve was good (tasted like \"roasted chocolate green tea\" according to one of their employees), the Matcha brownie was meh (I can't describe what it taste like...whether it was good or bad LOL), the mochi was good, the water jelly taste like nothing (reminded me of the teardrop cakes), the green tea jelly had an interesting/bitter taste, and the granola did not blend well with the rest of the parfait!! If they changed that to rice puffs or smth I would've preferred it a lot more. 

I think I would come back though 'cause the flavour was quite tasty and I would get the ice cream again just not the parfait lol."}
{"text":"Do you love Japanese desserts? I definitely do and this is such a great option! Their matcha cheesecake has a thicker texture and is complemented well with the azuki beans and the brown sugar. 

Definitely your go-to dessert after a bowl of savoury ramen!"}
{"text":"Went for the soft opening and loved it. I tried the matcha parfait and strawberry cheesecake, and couldn't help but compare it to the nearby Tsujiri.
- Matcha parfait: Really good. Same price as Tsujiri but a bigger serving. Also has a stronger matcha flavour (which I liked) and more ingredients in it's parfait like jelly and chocolate.
- Strawberry cheesecake: Pretty good. Has strawberry cream and non-baked cheesecake. Not too sweet and very satisfying.

In addition, servers were pleasant and quick. Looking forward to the full opening - will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Sharing a space with Konjiki Ramen, Saryo is a Japanese dessert spot for you to stop by before/after your ramen fix. 

There isn't a lot of seating (read: a handful of barstools), nor much room for standing, while you wait for your order. The bright woodsy decor reminds me a lot of similar chains like Tsujiri. 

My friend and I shared a tiny slice of the matcha \"cheesecake\" ($5.50 plus tax). Its texture was reminiscent of mousse (and strangely, shaving foam), rather than your regular, or even Japanese, cheesecake. The crust was quite good but a bit on the hard side. I later saw a tupperware chocked full of tiny slices (from a freezer, perhaps?) which may be the reason for the tough crust. The matcha flavour was quite good! Bitter and not too sweet.

Overall, I thought the menu options were a quite overpriced, considering a cone of soft serve was easily $5+. The staff are incredibly friendly but since there wasn't much seating, we walked over next door to Empress and finished the treat on a bench.

I wouldn't come out of my way to re-visit but wouldn't turn down a matcha soft serve if I was in the area. 

Side note: their payment terminal is super high tech. You insert your card from above - very fancy."}
{"text":"Great little space within Konjiki. Cute little space that serves matcha/hojicha desserts including ,but not limited to, ice creams, cakes, parfaits and etc.

The desserts are not too sweet they're actually kinda bitter (for the matcha anyways when compared to the hojicha one) which is great, in my opinion, after slurping away some ramen. The price is reasonable and you can't really go wrong with what's on the menu

Little heads up, if semi-bitter desserts ain't your thing, try the hojicha desserts instead of the matcha ones."}
{"text":"After dinner at Konjiki, there is a matcha dessert place, Saryo, beside Konjiki.  I personally do not like matcha so much, but this place really change my thought on matcha.  I ordered the soft ice cream, matcha cheesecake, and chestnut cheesecake.  Well, they are all very good.  I feel like it is even better than Tsujiri.  The matcha dessert in Tsujiri sometimes have a little bit of bitter taste.  I would recommend anyone who like or dislike matcha should give a try at Saryo."}
{"text":"This place is not even fair! Do you know when you bite into something and you don't even know how that item exists in your life and how you don't know how often you need to come there but you need it every day?!!! That is how I feel about their matcha brownies! 
They make the brownies in house! Be warned that they contain walnuts for anyone who is allergic! 

Matcha ice cream is a goooooooooo as well as their cheesecake! But seriously if you go to Konjiki Ramen (they share the space) get yourself a damnnnnn brownie!!! Oh wait don't because then they'll sell out before I can get more"}
{"text":"Welcome to Hojicha and Matcha heaven!!!!!!!! This place is the DA bomb for their tea flavoured ice cream and lattes!!! :D

We ordered the hojicha ice cream waffle & matcha latte float! 

Hojicha ice cream waffle($5.5) - It had a strong tea flavour but a hint of sweetness. The ice cream was sooo smooth & creamy and I love how they sprinkled some hojicha powder on top to give an even more hojicha essence! The waffle cone was very crunchy and tasted fresh!! Love it ! 5/5!!

Matcha latte float ($6)- the matcha ice cream on top of the drink had a strong matcha taste - it was a bit bitter but that's how tea suppose to taste like. The matcha ice cream was a SOLID 5/5!!! The matcha latte also had a strong matcha flavour but  the only thing I didn't like was the amount of ice they used. The entire cup was just ice. Next time , definitely going to ask for less ice. 3.5/5

This cafe is definitely a place to try if you like matcha/ hojicha flavoured ice cream/dessert. 

Note: Matcha ice cream is a lot more bitter than hojicha. So depends on your bitter tolerance, choose your ice cream carefully before ordering . 

For sweeter ice cream lovers go for hojicha and for the bitter hard-core tea lovers (like ME!!!) go for matcha !"}
{"text":"Situated inside Konjiki Ramen, this place is a wonderful place to grab a snack/dessert either after you eat your ramen or to satisfy your pangs of hunger while waiting for ramen.  It also earns you a sitting space while waiting for ramen (non-customers are not allowed to block this area, understandably so).  

We tried their cakes, their brownies, and their hojicha latte.  Their brownies are phenomenal and I would take that over their cakes any day.  There is a rich matcha flavour to it and the \"cakey\" texture that everyone loves.  Their latte was also very well made with very strong hints of hojicha.   As for their cakes, they were okay.  The green tea matcha cake executed the strong matcha flavour but it was the \"gel\" like texture of the mousse that I wasn't exactly a fan of.  Their base was also okay.  

Overall, I would definitely come back to try their ice creams and also grab another brownie or latte in the future.  It's a wonderful place - hopefully they will have more seating in the future too!"}
{"text":"Saryo, a Japanese dessert place that sells delicious matcha and roasted matcha soft serve and lattes, as well as cakes!  I've tried their matcha soft serve and it was more flavourful than other matcha soft serve places in the area--but their portions aren't very big.  Their roasted matcha latte was also sweet and delicious.  Around $5-5.50 each for the soft serve and latte."}
{"text":"This ice cream/dessert parlour is located inside a ramen shop. I came at around 1pm, so there wasn't a line up. I tried the hojicha and the matcha soft serve. They were both very flavoursome (though I think I favour their hojicha flavour more). They could have maybe given a bit more ice cream though...for around $5.50 a cone, the centre of my ice cream swirl should not have been hollow."}
{"text":"o m g gurrrrlllllllllll, this place is SO GOOD!!! 

They offer a variety of soft serves in matcha or hojicha flavour. They also sell rare cheesecakes here in the same flavours, and a chestnut cake that looked really good!

The matcha sundae comes with a couple mochi, some jellies, and brown sugar sauce drizzled on top. Man, that matcha soft serve... it wasn't too sweet and the matcha flavour was perfect.  

Would definitely come back for some more of that soft serve"}
{"text":"Saryo Cafe is situated within the same space as Konjiki Ramen, it takes up the front corner of the restaurant. Note that there are not a lot of seats. The selection at Saryo reminds me of the other Japanese dessert chain in Toronto, but with less variety. I wanted to try their cakes but when I asked the staff what they recommended, he wasn't too enthusiastic with the cakes. He said the soft serve is the most popular. So I got the Hojicha soft serve. The hojicha flavour is there but just a bit sweeter than I would have liked. My friend tried both and she prefers the matcha soft serve over the hojicha. Overall a decent place for some Japanese soft serve but I would prefer the other Japanese dessert chain over this one."}
{"text":"We went in today to get their famous parfait. And it was delicious. I'm really impressed with both the flavor combination and texture. It's really well thought out masterpiece. I eat a lot of Asian sweets, and this is probably my favorite dessert I've had in Canada. I love the different layers, and usually when you eat parfaits you end up  with the soggy melted stuff at the bottom, but with the jelly to help soak it up, it's like a new layer of dessert at the end. Ialso love that after eating this I don't feel icky (you know the feeling you often get after you've over indulged). My only regret is I split this with my sister, next time I'm definitely getting my own. Can't wait to try out their other offerings, the yuzu tart looks really interesting."}
{"text":"My friend told me to check it out since I love desserts and matcha! On my way home, I stopped by to try one of their desserts for the first time. 

Service: There were two friendly young ladies who greeted me with a smile and said hello! 

Dessert: I ordered a matcha ice cream in a cup (because it was a hot day and from my experience at Tsujiri, matcha ice cream melts fast). 

I really enjoyed the deep flavour of matcha (bit bitter) and the creamy and smooth texture. I didn't mind the bitterness at all! 

If you love matcha, you gotta try this place!!"}
{"text":"I went Saryo Cafe with my friend to have matcha desserts! 

There are many Japanese desserts like matcha, Hojicha and also cakes. I asked worker about their recommendation. I heard some cakes are popular there! ( I was so full and I couldn't try them at that time) I think I'll come back and try them next time. 

I didn't know that this place is located next to Ramen store! We already had lunch at another place, so we couldn't try Ramen. I wanna try next time! 

When I went there, there were two Japanese workers. One was guy and another worker is girl! Their services were so nice and polite! There are only few counter seats, so it's not easy to stay for a long time but i think this place is very good!"}
{"text":"Delicious. Literally the best matcha ice cream I've had in Toronto, Markham, North York, and surrounding area. The other ice cream was amazing too. It tasted like roasted barley tea. The \"Free cookie\" I got on valentine's day was also just the right level of savoury and sweet, and I guess that's the reason why I think this place is the best: balance.

Ever had that dessert that's way too sweet and you feel like scum at the end of it all? This place is nothing like that. The desserts feel delicate and sweet, but balanced with a mild bitterness and savouriness that feels mature. 

Yeah... that's right. The dessert made me feel like an adult. haha. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Both matcha and roasted hojicha soft serve ice cream are really smooth, creamy, and super rich in flavour. Definitely a great option while waiting for a table at konjiki and worthwhile to visit without getting ramen too.

If you're eyeing the ice cream, the best option really is just the ice cream cone. I wouldn't recommend the green tea sundae, which is half the ice cream (compared to cone) served with a brown sugar sauce, jellies, and mochi balls. The brown sugar sauce is good with the sides, but really takes away from the matcha flavour. I would even say they ruined the matcha ice cream by drizzling it on top. Sides are good, but nothing special. 

Rare matcha cheesecake was good flavour. I wasn't too fond of the texture. It's more of a dense mousse rather than a cheesecake."}
{"text":"Having recently opened here, I was excited to try this famous Japanese cafe in Toronto. 

They've opened up inside Konjiki Ramen (sharing the space), so don't expect to come to a cafe that you can relax at, rather it's almost just a waiting spot for the busy ramen joint. 


Their Hojicha is the reason to visit. It is just exceptional.

Expensive, but worth it."}
{"text":"Matcha latte and green tea cheesecake came up to about 12$ which is in line with all the other dessert places. The  cheesecake did not taste like green tea nor cheesecake-y. Felt like there was too much agar/gelatin, and was rather tasteless. The latte on the other hand was full of flavour and not too sweet. Will come back to try something else. But would not recommend the cheesecake."}
{"text":"I tried their matcha soft Serve and compared to Tsujiri it's a little too watered down and not blended. The Hojicha is a better choice. 

But in terms of sundaes, I like the topping at Sarto more,the jelly and anko is very flavourful and I like the texture more"}
{"text":"Tried this place after a huge dinner and enjoyed the light desserts. This placed is centered around matcha, so if you're not a fan of matcha and hojicha (who isn't), you might want to reconsider (there's a DQ next door). 

We went for the ice cream sundaes and the hojicha cheesecake. The cheesecake was light and fluffy and the matcha sundae was refreshing. It's quite busy (mostly standing room with a few bar stools) so it's not the best for hanging out with friends."}
{"text":"Good dessert place, especially after having a ramen at Konjiki since they are connected.

I was a bit worried about portion size of the icecream cone here based on the pictures that I've seen. But I think if you do the oiri (mochi rice balls) add-on, they give you a bit more icecream because they have to attach a certain number of the balls on....so i highly recommend the 50 cent oiri add on lol

Flavour wise, I would say their matcha icecream is very much on par with tsujiri, and is of good quality. Definition worth trying!"}
{"text":"Okay I'll say it, their matcha soft serve and hojicha soft serve are better than Tsujiri here. However, Tsujiri has more variety in their menus.  Saryo's soft serve flavours are stronger, the texture is creamier and the portions are bigger. It's quite a bit of ice cream for one person but I really like this place.

In the winter, they have a great matcha latte."}
{"text":"A must visit for matcha and dessert lovers! Their signature parfait was the perfect ending to our meal at Konjiki. The matcha ice cream, houjicha cream, shirotama mochi, ice jelly, and matcha brownies hit the spot for every single texture I could want in a dessert. 

If you're not sure what flavour to try, they will let you try the houjicha and matcha ice cream before you buy!

The signature parfait is my go-to order and it's a pretty hefty dessert. None of it was overly sweet in any way, the dessert was balanced and the price didn't hit my wallet too hard! It's on par with other dessert places in the area, but personally, this has been deemed as my favourite dessert place in quality and quantity.

Bf ordered the sundae and said it was pretty good as well. I don't think he was as big of a fan as me, but he's more of a milk ice cream type of person."}
{"text":"My sister recommended this place but cake is expensive and it's just alright. We tried the green tea, roasted green tea and chestnut. Expensive for more than $6 per slice, and it's a small slice but disappointed is that it doesn't taste very good. Flavours were bland and consistency of cake is somewhere between a hard mousse cake and soft cheesecake. Save your money. We may try ice cream in the future."}
{"text":"Japanese dessert shop sharing the same storefront as Konjiki Ramen. Smart idea as we lined up for dessert right after our dinner. They serve two types of green tea ice cream, matcha or hojicha (roasted green tea flavour). Fresh baked cakes and brownies, as well as sundaes, parfaits, waffle bowls, with their soft serve ice cream are also available. I tried the hojicha soft serve waffle cone ($5.50) and my boyfriend got the signature matcha parfait ($7ish). The hojicha has a nice subtle tea flavour but for soft serve, it was a little more icy in texture than creamy and melted rather quickly. I thought the matcha flavour was a little better. The parfait contains red bean, rice ball, jelly, granola, and is topped with a brownie. Lots of different textures but not a huge fan of the granola or jelly. They were flavourless and filled up almost half the cup. Overall decent and convenient if you're looking for dessert right after your meal. I wouldn't go out of my way to return but good for takeout and a stroll down Yonge if in the area."}
{"text":"Decided to stop by here after work since it was close by. I got the matcha ice cream with mochi, jellies and black sugar sauce, and I also got the matcha cheesecake. Both were really good! The matcha flavour on the ice cream is really strong, rich, and creamy, which I like! Thus far, the best matcha ice cream I have ever tried! I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Excellent! Service and product are on point. If you love matcha and dessert you will love it here."}
{"text":"I find this smart concept, the fact that it is located in conjunction with a ramen shop, people who aren't just full yet can also enjoy something sweet right afterwards without walking to another location. Before I ordered, I asked to try out the hojicha ice cream which they obliged to, I ended up getting that flavor on a cone. The taste was really strong, you can really taste the roasted green tea. The cone was okay, just a regular sugar cone. I'd come back to eat it right after ramen again! Service was good, ice cream was good but they gave a quite small amount so it was pretty pricey."}
{"text":"We ordered the Saryo signature parfait with matcha soft serve.  The parfait started off with a layer of green tea and water jelly at the bottom, then topped with hojicha cream, red bean, granola, matcha soft serve, mochi, and matcha brownie.  Lots of ingredients! The granola I personally wasn't a fan of. I felt that it didn't add much to the parfait.  The match soft serve, I will say is the best matcha soft serve I've had in Toronto.  Great amount of matcha flavour, and not grainy.  All the other places in Toronto that serve matcha soft serve has great flavour, but you're left with a grainy powdery aftertaste in your mouth.  The hojicha cream, I don't know how to describe, was a tad more bitter that matcha, more of a roasted but mild tea flavour?  Matcha brownie was a bit too dense for me, but again good matcha flavour."}
{"text":"I've had their matcha brownie, matcha cheesecake, and chestnut cake.

I always found a lot of desserts in Canada to be very sweet, but their desserts were perfect as far as sweetness goes. I would definitely come back here and tell my friends about this place. :)"}
{"text":"Matcha Soft Serve.....

Saryo Cafe is a Japanese dessert shop sharing the same space as Konijiki Ramen. Just perfect to have a dessert after eating at Konijiki. Seating though can be tight and uncomfortable as the line for Konijiki was overflowing into the seating area. 

The staff here though all smiley and in a good mood. I would if my desserts is making all these people happy!

I will be back as I have not try their roasted hojicha soft serve. But I love their matcha everything! So smooth and just the perfect sweetness and bitterness."}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite place for matcha desserts! This is a matcha lovers paradise with a wide selection of matcha ice cream, cakes and drinks. It is located inside of Konjiki ramen which can be a bit confusing as it seems you need to join the long line for Konjiki ramen to enter the cafe. 
We ordered the Saryo signature parfait ($7.50), matcha soft serve with oiri ($5.50) and the green tea sundae ($5.50). The saryo parfait had a glorious presentation with matcha brownie, mochi red beans and granola finished with a sugary syrup. The taste of the matcha ice cream was strong and but not overpowering and not overly sweet. The matcha brownie definitely added another level to the parfait. It was soft and chewy and also oozed with matcha flavor. I could have done without the granola bits at the bottom which were a little too gritty for my liking. The green tea sundae was also amazing with the fresh mochi that complemented the dessert well. 
I would recommend going earlier in the evenings as it does tend to get busy in the later hours and weekends and can be challenging to find seating in a small place."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place and it doesn't disappoint.  They have the best taste of hojicha ice cream and cheesecake ever.

Also their matcha soft serve is also really good.  You can tell they use authentic matcha in it.  All their ingredients come from Japan which is probably why it tastes so good.

Plus the people are super nice.  They gave us free sample of the cheesecake and ice cream.  Another matcha winner!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I came here twice and tried out both flavours (both times!). The matcha soft serve here is my favourite even though I do love the houjicha one as well. Make sure to try their match brownie and their jellies. I am a big fan! There is not many seatings so just be mindful of that."}
{"text":"We got their matcha parfait 5.75$ +tax. The taste was decent but it's like kid size. The portions are super small for the price. A bit of icecream, 2 mochi balls, and 2 pieces of jello. The mochi were nice and bouncy, the matcha jello was okay but the clear jello had no taste. 
I suggest getting either their cone for better value"}
{"text":"Saryo Cafe is located just right in front of Konjiki Ramen. The space is small and people waiting for ramen will probably end up watching you eat your soft serve, but it's well worth it. There are around 8-9 seats available in the small space and staff are always very polite and friendly. They specialize in matcha and hojicha soft serve but they also have a variety of other cakes as well. The hojicha soft serve and sundae are my all time favourites! I've also tried the Uji matcha brown and it was delicious as well. 

Definitely a favourite in the neighbourhood, I know I will be back for more in the spring/summer."}
