{"text":"This is the best indoor play place that I have found in the Phoenix area. They have an incredible play area for kids 1.5-8. We also brought some teenagers with us and they enjoyed playing with the little ones for a while. However, I have to take off some stars for the customer service. The first time in, we were promptly greeted by a woman who was very grouchy. Throughout our couple of visits she constantly is grouchy. I'm not sure if she is a manager and trying to keep everything in order. But she just has made our few encounters miserable. Also, the seating for adults is not the most comfortable. Despite the negative aspects due to the fact that my kids enjoy themselves immensely, we will be back, we had considered the monthly plan but at this time are going to refrain."}
{"text":"My daughter has been here twice and loves it! I think the kinetic sand is so cool that they have and the little grocery store to play pretend and hair salon. Super fun for kids and clean too!"}
{"text":"Fun Place for the kids. Plenty of seating in the play area for parents. I will say the toddler area is more for ages 3+ esp the banana swings- very hard for younger kids to get on and it never stops spinning so you can't even help your child onto it. The infant area is better for 1-3 (even though it says for new walkers only) Arcade games are kinda pricey. Kinetic sand table had hair and other things in it (but really, I'm not sure how this could be kept clean anyway) but it did kinda gross me out. Staff was friendly, facility was clean other then the sand table."}
{"text":"Such a great place for kids of all ages! There is alot for them to do! It doesnt look big but walking through everything, the fun seems neverending! I recently signed my 6 yr old son up for the Summer Camp and he has gone a few times. Jae is the Event Coordinator who we met and my son is extremely apprehensive around new people; however he warmed up to her immediately!  She took her time showing us around and explained everything about the Summer Camp in great detail. She is amazing with all kids, as I noticed are all the staff. My son even hugged her, which is rare for him lately. He was really quick to warm up to another staff member, Tristan. He seems really great with kids!   Jae has so many creative ideas for the kids and it's great she has a schedule planned out, and each day has a fun theme! She has been wonderful to work with.  It's really affordable when comparing to other summer camps. Would be a great place for a Birthday party too! It's great we have something like this in the area!! I also had fun playing with my kids, the slides are pretty fun too!!"}
{"text":"Great place to take the kids to play especially when it's hot outside. They have charging stations for your phone and free WiFi so you can enjoy yourself while the kids play. No shoes inside the play area even for adults so be sure and wear nice socks lol. The staff is friendly and always cleaning :)"}
{"text":"The older lady at the front was a grump and the food is taking an extra long time.  Other than that this place is cool"}
{"text":"Pretty awesome place inside!! Staff was very rude, probably won't go back anytime soon. Was told I would get a $2.00 off because of my complaints  and then didn't give me the $2.00 off like they said they would. This place is a joke."}
{"text":"Clean and fun. It can get really crowded which if it's too much they will give you a free pass to return another time so I could leave early. The staff does keep it very clean for a indoor playground."}
{"text":"The kids love this place, that's what matters most! When they need to get their energy out Luv 2 Play provides an avenue for that. The equipment is safe as far as I can tell, the place is kept up (it is new) and there is enough to do that it keeps the kids busy for hours. The food isn't the best, although they have Dippin' Dots which makes up for some of it, and the staff still doesn't seem sure of how to run the check-in. Overall it's a great place to come once in a while."}
{"text":"I decided to take my son here for his birthday and I wish I would have chosen something else to do. We went on a Wednesday. The facility is clean and the ladies up front do their best to keep traffic moving in and out. The only reason for the low review is because I found it very cramped. They had a field trip going on that day and it was poorly organized. My son was constantly getting pulled and pushed by bigger kids. I was ready to leave after the first five minutes but we ended up staying almost an hour.  Pros: clean, lots of stuff to do, booties to cover socks in the bathroom Cons: not enough small tables for the children to eat at, too many kids at one time, not enough staff on the floor"}
{"text":"My youngest loves this place we come anytime we can. Deals are good food is good love the prices and the arcade is fun. My youngest just runs around and enjoys himself with a great security where the door is locked and can't get out and they verify before u leave"}
{"text":"Great place to take the kiddos, but employees looked a little exhausted and this was a week day. I want to give a 4 Star but it's the parents. Not the workers. They don't keep an eye on their kids and older kids pushing my 20 month old over didn't go over to well especially when the 2 kids were asked by my wife not to push and one said to the other \"don't listen to her\". Pretty freakin rude. But the facility was great even with one ride broken my daughter had a blast"}
{"text":"WOW!! We just found this place and were so excited. Today would be our 4th visit and it's was just terrible. We brought our 4 year old and it was a crazy UNSUPERVISED MADHOUSE!!! My daughter came home with a swollen, bruised cheek. A boy threw a fireman's hat at her before my husband could get to her. No parents watching their brat son and no staff around. My husband told the lady on their quick departure.  THIS PLACE SHOULD HAVE MORE STAFF AND HAVE AT LEAST SOMEONE WALKING AROUND KEEPING SOME SORT OF ORDER."}
{"text":"My 4 year old had a great time and we will definitely be back!  We were there for 2 1/2 hours but easily could have have stayed much longer (we only left because they were closing).  The climbing structure is huge and there are a lot of different things to do.  We went on a Sunday afternoon and it was packed (2 birthday parties going on) but there was still plenty of seating for the adults and the climbing structure never looked busy because it's so big."}
{"text":"Our kids had a blast here! We stayed for hours. The entry fee is a little high but it was so worth it! Food in the cafe is very reasonable. There is literally something to do for every single age group which they have sectioned off so that the older kids don't trample all over the babies and the toddlers. The facility and bathrooms were very clean and smelled fresh! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Pretty cool place. My 3 yr old son loves it. Price is very good (no charge for parents, even though you're allowed on the equipment too). Overall, great."}
{"text":"My kids had a great time here. My youngest is under 1 so she was able to get in for free with her sister. It wouldn't be worth paying the entrance fee for that age.   They seemed to be understaffed during our visit for the amount of kids visiting with summer camps. I will not be back till school starts again. Way too busy for the number of staff to keep up. Long waits to be buzzed in and out of the gate at the front door. Plus it was too busy and chaotic for parents to keep track of their little ones (or at least that's what I will assume since another little girl intentionally kicked my daughter in the chest with no parent in sight to reprimand). I also found it hard to always keep visual sight on my daughter with all the other kids when in the play areas.   I will try again once the summer ends."}
{"text":"I took my four kids to meet a friend at Luv 2 Play for the first time today and was pleasantly surprised by the entire facility.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  The security measures they have in place are excellent.  The play zones for younger kids is great. The Kinetic Sand area is a smart idea. I have not seen such a sensory station in other play places.  They didn't miss any details in designing the bathroom: disposable booties to go over your socks right outside the door, a child size toilet, step stools to reach the sinks. The cafe provides plenty of options for all ages: baby food, puffs, uncrustables, trail mix, snacks, sandwich wraps and more. (Peanut alert!)  We spent 4 hours here and the kids would have stayed longer if we didn't have to get home for homeschool work.   We will definitely be back-- especially with the $3 coupon on the back of the Fry's receipt"}
{"text":"Love this place. My 6 year old has so much fun. Their summer camp is great too. They have a nice crazy cafeteria with kid friendly food."}
{"text":"This is a great place for the kids during the scorching summer. It was fairly clean considering how many kids were there. The prices were reasonable. We will defiantly be back soon and don't forget to bring a pair of socks."}
{"text":"The only thing I did not like about this place was the other kids and parents. Parents take their kids here and just let them act like animals. I don't know if they think they can just stop watching their kids and let them act like chimpanzees but you can't. As far as the establishment it was what I expected busy, dirty, not sanitized. Whose great idea is it to walk into the bathroom with only socks. Apparently they have little covers to put over your socks but they were out. Little boys pee on the ground"}
{"text":"Such a fun place for kids of all ages! Staff was extremely nice except for a very grumpy and rude older woman at the front. However a boy there I believe his name was Christian or Tristan? was extremely nice and very friendly when I was asking for assistance. My kids were able to run around freely and the play structure was a very decent size. I have a 5 year old son that loves the ball guns and we had a lot of fun playing together in the pretend houses."}
{"text":"This is great place for kids to have fun and get out of the heat. My girls (4&2) loved it so much!!!! Few things that bothered me though.... 1. The front door to get in was broke someone had to let us in. 2. There was no instructions on how to get set up. We waited in line for about 7-10 min before we were told we had to get out of line and go fill out the waiver then get back in line. 3. They have certain sections for certain age groups. Twice I had to go get an employee to tell older kids to get out of the toddler (ages 1-4) section.   Besides those issues it's a great place. It's unlimited time. I will go back!"}
{"text":"Love this place call for deals on some days! My son had a good time!! And every one need socks"}
{"text":"This has pretty much everything your kids love: an enormous indoor playplace with tunnels, large slides, an obstacle course, and a ball pit. Even bigger kids should enjoy this portion of the Luv 2 Play. There's also a few sections specifically designed for the very young children, with foam blocks, a smaller playplace and slide, and a Playdough station amongst other things. At least a few hours worth of entertainment.  The snackbar offers pizza delivered from NYPD pizza, which is pretty decent and comes at a fair price per slice. The place is also well-maintained/clean. I would say Luv 2 Play is at the top of the list for places to bring your children where they'll have a blast and burn a lot of energy."}
{"text":"Love this place just as much as my son does. Only thing I suggest is having lockers to put your personal belongings in instead of the cubbyholes. Other than that, we have a lot of fun when we go"}
{"text":"This place is a kid favorite! They have May fun activities for the kids! The food is not good at all! And it's hard to find the good seating as adults, but kids love it!"}
{"text":"My mom took my daughter here and came home absolutely raving about it. It's clean. The staff was awesome and helpful.  She has already told some of her friends about it and definitely plans to take my daughter here again next time she watches her."}
{"text":"My wife and I arranged for a party at Luv 2 Play. We purchase a package birthday party thinking this would be a great experience for friends and family. What we encountered was a complete nightmare. We were lied to by employees regarding services provided, and could not get a response after our initial deposit. After 23 phone calls we finally had a response just 3 days prior to the party. All the information that we were told was incorrect, and the food could not be provided due to the kitchen being broken. Then to top it off we had to deal with management who screamed and yelled at me right in front of other family and friends. So unprofessional. I actually had to calm down the member of management and walk her to the front of the store. The manager harassed me throughout the party for payment. Then overcharged me. I would never take my kids back to this location, nor have a party here. Management who have tempers do not belong around children. The experience was a disaster. I contacted corporate offices to discuss what had occurred. They could care less, they just want your money!"}
{"text":"good for kids under 10. rides, pretend play, slides and a mini arcade where they can get tickets for prizes...yes please. the fact that they have free wifi, adults enter for free and a cafe where there are relatively better choices...I would reccommend this place.   Con:it can get pricey so be sure to avail of their specials..groupon or half off tuesday. Also it is located in surprise so it is a little bit further away.  Note that both adults and kids need socks as they dont allow shoes inside even in the bathrooms"}
{"text":"My kid loves to play here! Great space, clean, and friendly staff. They have a good selection of snack foods and lunch type options. The arcade games seem to always be clean and working great! All in all this is an active children's dream place! We will be visiting here again for sure!"}
{"text":"Took our grandkids 1, 3 & 5 year olds even though the 3 year old was a friend's child but had to say he was ours otherwise it was an extra $4 , $30 to get them in ouch a little bit , kids had a blast lots for them to do and play , got a $20 play card , was it worth it still not sure we didn't use the whole amount but ever game was about .65 to play . Ordered a ham and swiss sandwich 2 soda's came to 10.50 and got a ham and American cheese sandwich  grilled sandwich ,not sure how they screwed seeing as I was the only one who had ordered anything in the first hour we were there and $10.50 not worth it . The staff we did see cleaning a lot which is good with as many little ones running around. Total time there about 2 1/2 hours and $60 later , if you don't eat or drink it could be worth it  but hey we do it for the kids right , will let the Daughter bring them next time with the game card and see what she thinks . Not bad though"}
{"text":"My kids go to the camp here on all of their breaks. It's an amazing camp and we have told so many about it. The teachers are amazing and my kids look forward to going. Great safe environment! Ms.Megan has been phenomenal. Would totally recommend it and it's very affordable."}
{"text":"So fun! Kinda smells like feet in there but you can't wear shoes so i guess that's expected. My almost two year old loved running around and exploring. It seems like a very safe place for the children to play. We will return often!"}
{"text":"Pretty awesome place. They have thought of everything. Wish they would offer some better coffee choices for the parents."}
{"text":"My kids had an absolutely blast playing here! Lots of fun! My only suggestion would be more comfortable seating for the parents. The more comfortable the parents are the longer the kids can stay & play."}
{"text":"I just experienced BAIT AND SWITCH from this company. So frustrated, because the advertisement for the camp was 35 for one child for March 12 to April 13. So I signed my daughter up and selected my days and paid for it. Now they're telling me it was a computer error that it didn't charge me per day AND it was also their fault that they falsely advertised their services. I spoke to Marcus the regional manager and was basically told that I wasn't able to obtain my services EVEN though I had already paid for it."}
{"text":"This place is really fun for the summer months. I feel the price is fair and the snack food options are good too. My only complaint is how busy it is. I wish they could cap it off some way because it gets super crowded. Didn't seem to bother my daughter though. We will definitely go back, maybe even purchase the season pass! Don't forget socks like I did or you will have to purchase them for $2"}
{"text":"I love this place!!! Its clean and the staff are friendly. There's arcade games, slides, ball pits and blocks for the kids to play and keep busy with. I will definitely be coming back!!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I brought our kids to Luv2Play yesterday. I was blown away by the size and just how much there is for kids to do there. It was worth the money. I paid about $20 for my daughter and son. There's something for every age (1-12 I'd say). There are even arcade games. There's a kinetic sand area and a pretend play area as well. I appreciated the security. My family and I wore bracelets with a barcode that had our last name on them. You cannot leave without getting the bracelet taken off by a worker there. Also, the door has an alarm so if anyone tries to leave, everyone will know. The only reason I gave this place 4 stars was the pricing for one year olds. My friend brought her daughter. Of the two hours we were there she probably played for 20 minutes. That's not worth $11 plus the gas money it takes to get to Surprise from Peoria. All in all I HIGHLY recommend this place. I felt so comfortable sitting every now and then while my kids were off playing! It's safe, secure, and a lot of fun!"}
{"text":"Great place for the kids to play but 45 minutes for tater tots and chicken strips is ridiculous. Would love to give them more stars but with a 1 year old I would have been better just leaving. Especially when there is no outside food allowed inside."}
{"text":"So this place is pretty cool.... my kids loved it and didn't want to leave. The only reason this isn't a 5 star review is the service. We came one morning and there were literally two other families in the entire place. Somehow we still ended up waiting in the lobby for 20 minutes before one of the staff members helped us. When we got there they were having issues getting another family signed in, there were THREE staff members huddled around the computer for this one family. Finally after 20 minutes we were acknowledged (no \"we will be right with you\" or anything prior) and the girl was extremely unhelpful and rude. Once we got in the kids enjoyed themselves until we ran into another issue, we waited in line for food for another 5-10 minutes just to buy a bag of chips. This place has potential of being amazing but the staff ruined it for me. For that reason alone I likely won't be back. We will take our money to one of the other 5 indoor play gyms."}
{"text":"Price is comparable to nearby facilities and the size of this play place is huge. We especially like the moon sand area.  Summer time is extremely overcrowded and severely understaffed.  During our most recent visit we were asked by staff not to use the \"breastfeeding only\" gliders since I was formula feeding my baby.  I find this very distasteful. During our same visit there were several times that the same group of rough-housing 3 yr olds would literally run around and climb the walls of the \"baby only zone\" endangering my daughter, and the rest of the babies trying to enjoy themselves without a staff member in sight.  You should direct the staffs attention away from whose deserving enough to rock their babies and towards the safety of the children.    Please consider providing the same luxery to every mother who has a hungry, cranky, tired baby or enforce ALL singage/rules equally."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times now with my 3-year old nephew. He absolutely loves it! There is so much for him to do that we can spend half the day here. The pricing is decent and the staff is friendly. This is going to be a regular place for us."}
{"text":"We've been here multiple times and our kids love it. It's clean, safe, and fun. The prices are reasonable and it even fun for the parents. They have good available if you want."}
{"text":"We love bringing the kids here!! It's fun for all ages, the adults even have some fun! We usually go Saturday morning (before all the birthday parties start), but we recently went on a Sunday after 2 and it was really slow, which was great!"}
