{"text":"Nice local place - food was pretty good and prices good. Atmosphere definitely relaxing too - recommended -"}
{"text":"Awesome place! Small but not tiny, and importantly, not too loud. Drinks are good, average prices, and the food selection is surprisingly great. We've had the pasta carbonara and a la vodka with rose sauce, chicken fingers, and the 6oz steak in the past week, and all have been great! Really good veggies with the steak too, and great pasta sauces. Grolsch on tap is good, and they make a strong rye and ginger. Will definitely become a frequent hangout."}
{"text":"This place is a bit odd - it's like an Italian restaurant that decided to become a pub, but didn't quite make the complete transition.  No Guinness on tap but they do have it in cans.  I had the haddock & chips - fish was fairly tasty but it came with no lemon and the tartar sauce was basically relish mixed with a bit of mayo.  Also, they skimped on the chips but they tasted like they had been frozen anyway.... husband had the Ken Burger, which he says was delicious, but same story with the fries that came with it.

We were kind of still hungry after finishing these things (or maybe it was just me) so ordered the Vegetarian nachos.  Really good, perfect amount of cheese along with zucchini, mushroom and salsa mixed in.  Order your sour cream on the side if you'd rather not have it blorped on top of everything."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, has a nice patio area in the back. It's a small and quaint bar. The owner is nice. Sometimes you have to wait, and sometimes you have the bar to you and your friends. Price is average for most bars, I enjoy the location and setting. People generally keep to themselves, if you want cheaper there is a bar right beside this one but it looks super sketchy."}
{"text":"Quiet local bar with a decent tap list and a nice back patio. Good for a relaxed evening, or if you're just hanging out with a pint and a book."}
{"text":"We were very impressed with the food! Service was good and patio is great. Never came here before because it is so close to our home but will definitely be back. Lounge room looks amazing."}
{"text":"What a nice little lounge bar!  After an evening watching Improv at Comedy Bar, my companion and I had a hankering for a follow-up drink.  Casting our eyes across the street, our decision was made by convenience.  Little did we know that it would be so nice inside!  We were sat in a comfortable two-person booth where we were able to take in the surroundings.  The main thing I remember is part of a pitchfork that was hung on the wall - so needless to say, it was a bit of a quirky place.  Had a bit of a \"down home\" feel, especially for a bar in Toronto.  It wasn't overly loud, but definitely not too quiet.  We were able to have a good conversation for a couple hours without yelling.  Oh, and they had some really good music playing!  Beatles, Bruce Springsteen...nice and laid back.  There was a slightly separated area that I noticed on a trip to the powder room, where a group of friends were comfortably seated...in front of a fireplace!  Now it may have been the alcohol, but I thought it looked real...or at least it was a really nice fake one.  The service was great - the server seemed to be the only one there, but she brought us our drinks amazingly quickly.  They had a good selection of beers on tap, and we went with Amsterdam blonde.  

I can't speak to the food except that they apparently have it, nor to the prices since I didn't see them...but all in all, if I were in the area, I would definitely head over there for a chill evening with friends."}
{"text":"After traipsing back and forth along Bloor at 11pm at night looking for a place that can accommodate 8 of us (there's not much choice in the vicinity here!), we stumbled upon the Black Horse. 

When I went into ask for a seat for 8 people, she bluntly told me she cannot seat us.  I noticed a small nook in the back with empty couches, and asked if we can sit over there, and she changed her tone and said, \"oh yes, if you want the couches!\"

It was great. we had our own little private corner with a fireplace, 3 love seats and some chairs.  The narrow table was awkwardly placed, and the heights were not right either, but it felt like a strange man's living room, and yet we felt right at home. 

Wine was $5.25 a glass, and beer (premium was $5.30).  It was a nice quiet place to chat and I'm sorry if we got a little rowdy. 

The place closes at 1am, which was fine for us, and the server ended up being super nice. 

Someone in the group got a penne pasta - it looked quite big and was $13.  We also got nachos for $11.00 - a little small.  I can't speak for the food, but I'd come back mainly for drinks. 

Just loved the cozyness of the place. Maybe we just got lucky that night."}
{"text":"DISCLAIMER - This isn't so much a review for the establishment as it is for the burger:

When you find something in this world that makes you feel amazing from your feet to your head you hold on to it.  When something grabs hold of you and makes you feel like you're the luckiest person on earth to discover such an incredible thing, are you really going to let it go?  No way, you're going to run out and find that feeling again.  My bro Jordan and I had that feeling last night.

We were walking down Bloor towards this dive of a bar called The Black Horse.  I shouldn't say it's a crap hole, it's actually not too bad inside, but there's nothing cool really about it.  It doesn't even have anything Canadian on tap.  No Keith's. No Rickards. No Canadian.  There's a few booths, more tables and dim lighting.  We'd never been there before, but after my move we wanted to search for some new funky bars in my new neighbourhood.  The TO blogs had all said The Black Horse was a historical landmark, and they were right.  Try the Ken Burger.

The Ken Burger is a moist, juicy burger the size of a small child.  It's topped off with the works including some very crispy bacon strips.  I'm pretty sure mozzerella and cheddar are melted onto the patty for you.  You don't need to order anything else because if you finish this burger...you're good.

Now Jordan and I thought the burger looked good, but when we bit down our lives were changed forever.  This may very well be the best burger we've ever had.  And do you think we're going to forget that?  No way, it went into the blackberry under Burgers!  To explain in a little more depth, I was so full last night that I passed out immediately after getting home.  I woke up to the taste of this burger in my mouth.  I wanted another for breakast.  Yes at 5am I wanted one of these delicious burgers.  It was almost a shame to brush my teeth.

The Black Horse (W. of Ossington on Bloor). Order the Ken Burger."}
{"text":"This place is for drinking with friends, and it's all about the patio.  Food here is an afterthought. Keep that in mind. Eat here if you're already drinking with friends and are too lazy to go elsewhere. It's best to eat first, then go to hang here over drinks. 

This place is great for enjoying beer or cider with friends. They have Strongbow in bottles which is a nice alternative to hops. Pass on the wine list. In the summer it's all about their back patio. It's small, and inviting with the flowers. There's a grape arbor to provide some shade as well.  It's a quite and calm spot, making it a wonderful place to relax in the summer.

 Inside vibe is really quite nice, like a lowbrow pud. There's living room chill space with worn out furniture in the back that may remind you of hanging out in a friend's basement when you were kids - actually kinda cool.

The calamari is okay, probably pre-prepared. The souvlaki is pretty good, but the rice is bland (add some salt). The fajita isn't a bad choice, a strong tomato base to the sauce, but the veggies are good and so is the chicken."}
{"text":"This is one of those places where the neighbourhood stops by.
Now, it wasn't on my list of places to go but it was a spot I frequently saw on get together lists so having a free evening, I thought 'why not?'

The space is very much pub first with one comfortable meeting space in the back. Old chairs and old sofas that must I don't know how old and I am sure haven't been cleaned in since purchased. It's not a place where you expect clean and modern. This is all about comfort and sitting for a few hours talking.

Food, nope didn't have any. I was told no the place for it so I listened and I just had a few drinks.

Great place to chill with a friends and a beer. Can't go wrong. Customer service can be spotty but the best thing to do to get their attention is to just go up to the server rather than wait - cuz you going to be awaiting awhile if you do that."}
{"text":"Service was amazing. It wasn't a very busy night so we basically had the full attention of our server. She was very attentive, but not intrusive. The burger special was delicious. Not a huge cider selection. The back patio is really nice. A little oasis in the city."}
{"text":"garlic bread
coke in cans
souvlaki ok
lamb shank on pumpkin w. beans - gingerry
service is slow but only one girl and lots of ppl showed up so no worries
garlic bread was exact sizes so prolly premade
chicken fingers meh"}
{"text":"So yummy.  And the decor is lovely.  And I really thought the staff did a fantastic job of taking care of our very large disorganized group."}
{"text":"The burger is pretty alright, and the beer isn't the most expensive I've ever had.  The waitresses are super awesome, and not creepy and leany-overy.  

End of the day, if you want to hang out, and have a good meal, this is a pretty decent place to stop by.

Just don't touch the little hanging candle holders.  They burn.

A lot."}
{"text":"We weren't quite sure what to expect when we went into the extremely dark Black Horse for lunch one afternoon. I'm all for conserving energy, but it would've been hard to see each other let alone our food if we had sat in the front room that relied on the natural sunlight that was coming through the storefront windows. 

Instead of walking out though, we opted to sit in the back, where the well worn couches faced the fire place, and ate off of a coffee table while chatting sitcom style. My fish and chips were of standard \"nothing special\" bar fare quality. I can imagine that they would've been much better in the midst of a few pints. My lunch date's burger looked dryish, but was reported a-okay. I'll probably never come back again strictly for the food, but think that it'd be a trusty watering hole for a larger group."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were lured in here by their lunch special sign out on the street. After browsing the menu we went with other things that the special. My salad was limp, I could have made the same or better at home. My lady's pasta was ok, nothing to cheer about, nut no complaints. 

This is basically your grungy neighbourhood pub. Considering the stretch of Bloor that its on, its no surprise what the inside of the place looks like."}
{"text":"Been here a few months ago to meet friends. Prices are pretty modest for mixed drinks and beer but the food is really nice for the cost. Despite the time it took to get our bill at the end despite it not being visibly busy I still really enjoyed this place and will definitely be back again!
Also highly recommend the seafood here! It is very delicious!"}
