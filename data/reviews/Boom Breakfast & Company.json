{"text":"Way over priced for what it is.   This place is a classic example of \"great branding\".   Decor was sharp and well themed. Clean blue tiles, egg shaped lighting etc.   But then you look at the food options and the prices and it's just so boring.   You can have eggs, eggs, eggs or eggs. With a side of eggs.  Cmon...give me one of those big plate options with bacon and/or sausage home fries, toast. And it shouldn't be $14 either.   I'll stick to better prices, wider selections, and less \"selling the sizzle, not the steak\""}
{"text":"I was so excited when BOOM opened in my neighborhood as there was absolutely nothing in the area open for breakfast early besides McD's and Tim H's !  And how happy BOOM made me! I have now gone a few times and would go back for more.  Now I want to be clear here. This isn't a cheap and cheerful diner we're talking about.. Some may say it's overpriced for what you get ( I did see a box of aunt jemima pancake mix sitting on the kitchen shelf) but it is not a run of the mill golden griddle or Perkins so you do pay for that more intimate, trendy feel (and so you should in my opinion as it is not a major chain). Always trying to be accomodating, they have booster seats and high chairs but on a weekend prepare to wait as the place is small and like I said it's pretty much the only game in the area. Boom is solid. A good breakfast, good service, friendly and dependable. You should go.  Oh! FYI only 1 larger table exists so keep your party around the 4-5 people mark!"}
{"text":"Ordered the huevos wrap--it was nothing special, just eggs in a tortilla with very small portions of salsa, refried beans, guac and sour cream all visibly out of a can on the side. It would have been OK if it hadn't been $10 for the huevos -- with no home fries or coffee included. Terribly over priced for terribly mediocre food. The atmosphere and service were fine, but $16 for diner breakfast (with coffee, tax, tip) is absurd. For $16 you can get an amazing brunch at many other places in this city."}
{"text":"I've been to the boom on Eglinton and came out 100% satisfied ... Maybe it's because I ordered take out from this one on st Clair that I'm so disappointed... I had the threesome... Something that leaves me usually full... This time not at all.. My \"fruit garnish\" was three small pieces of melon!!! Maybe this place is only meant to sit down in the restaurant and eat..."}
{"text":"Solid breakfast option. Reasonably priced, good, quick, efficient service. I just wish there was a little more imagination on the menu, even though it's a large menu nothing stands out."}
{"text":"the first time i actually considered skipping out on the bill because it was so gotdamn lame. -i asked if i could get a substitute for the pork loin (as i dont eat meat), was told i could not but i could get the same meal without the meat for 50 cents less  -toast was stale, dry, hard  -eggs were tasteless  -portions of all were scarce  -dishes were streak-stained and dirty  -never was offered the coffee that was supposed to be complimentary with the meal  Edit: also, service is shit and everything's extremely overpriced"}
{"text":"Everything about boom is pretty middle of the road,  the service,  the food,  the drink selection.  They're not killin it but it's a good place to sit down and have some easy breakfast"}
{"text":"The staff here are incredibly rude. I'll be honest I thought this was the Starving Artist because there was a waffle sign outside the door (it's actually one more door down). I decided to give it a try anyways. I wish I didn't! Food was nothing special, if you want meh eggs and toast find somewhere with better service!"}
{"text":"Pros: -Amazin' food -Amazin' juices and drinks -Localization, you have a lot of stores and street cars to access it Cons: -Regular service, once the waitress made me fell embarassed"}
{"text":"I like the idea of this place, but it seems like every time I go, they are short on serving staff. Because of this, you get sub-par service. For example, every time I ask for soy milk on the side for my coffee, the server forgets it, then doesn't check on our table to see if we need anything. They look kind of bothered that you are asking them for something and aren't super friendly."}
{"text":"Very good food!!! Very friendly waitress! we really are happy chose to eat here!"}
{"text":"Love the name, love this little oasis of great service and food. This has a varied menu to make every one happy. The innerds are fun and it is all pristine and clean. You should not miss this one :o)"}
{"text":"Good breakfast if you are willing to pay me and brother went for breakfast with freshly squeezed oj and it came u like alot can't remember the price but way too much"}
{"text":"I was there for a brunch. I forgot to take a picture but friendly service and amazing food. Going back this week"}
{"text":"Amazing pancakes filled with fruit,friendly staff fast service."}
{"text":"BOOM BOOM POW  OOH how I luv thee BOOM, the food is amazing and I have absolutely nothing to complain about. I don't mind waiting in the line-up at all on weekends because I know I will be totally satisfied by my food choice.  Job Well Done Boom and I will carry on coming back for more"}
{"text":"Excellent service! We went there today around 12:30pm (busiest time) and there was a wait. It was not too bad, because there's only two of us, waited for about 10 minutes.  This a very small place, so plan ahead, if you are going with a bigger party, go earlier. While we were waiting, the host came out a couple times. First she took down how many people in your group and ask if you want a coffee while waiting (free!) and then second round, she came with a plate of banana bran muffin and cranberry muffin in sample size (very delicious); third round, she came over with fresh waffles in sample size again with some icing sugar! if the wait was longer, we'd be done LOL.  This kind of service is really rare in town, makes your wait a lot less painful.   we tried the egg benny that everyone recommended and the white tuna sandwich. I felt that the egg benny is just alright... there are places that make better egg benedicts... my sandwich is nice, because it is not as heavy as the egg benny. We also ordered a juice and the straw-nana smoothies.   I might go back and try some other dishes... I'm guessing the quality may have dropped a bit today because of the business. I would go back for the service and their waffle that I only get to try while I was waiting in line."}
{"text":"My experience at Boom on St. Clair is always nothing short of amazing. I am usually greater by Lina, very distinguishable with the wife steak in her hair. Her firey spark really warms me up and makes me want to just hug her.   Sometimes when Lina isn't there, I walk in and see an adorably cute Taylor whose memory of my habits always amazes me. She is always perfect at my orders and somehow makes my food taste better, must be her glowing energy she emanates, you just want to be in her presence.   I had the pleasure getting to know Deloris the Batista a Saturday or Sunday ago. Her sweet attitude and beautiful energy was intoxicating you hung on her every word.   With the ever gorgeous Mary checking on you, and the truly spectacular food that is made, I go no where else, not even the other locations.   Thank you Boom on St Clair for always making me feel so very happy everyone I leave there. It makes it even harder to go to work."}
{"text":"Sorry, you've increased your priced and lowered your quality.  Whoa, $13 gets you a coffee and two (2) pancakes??!  I came here for the special of the day but they increased the price.  Fortunately, there are more options in the area."}
{"text":"I've been looking for breakfast spots that I can count on and Boom Breakfast & Company fits the bill.  Experienced excellence service.  Attentive and friendly without interfering in the conversation and meal my friend & I were having. Also happily adapted a menu item for my friend so she could have the breakfast she wanted.  The menu had a good selection of options to suit most tastes.  Had the Boom Power Breakfast (2 extra large eggs any style with  premium sliced bacon) for  $9.29.  Comes with toast and home fries.  All the food came to our table quickly, was hot and tasted good.  The fries were deep fried and good as far as that style goes.  I usually prefer the hash style with this kind of breakfast.  The only two negatives.   The last wasn't very hot & served in a tall glass mug (which tends to lend to the coffee cooling off too quickly).   Whipped butter product was served with the toast.  Uck!   I will definitely be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised this morning when my friend and I ventured to Boom for breakfast. There was no wait, most likely because it's Wednesday and most people have jobs but not us....Anyway, there was a sign outside welcoming the Miss Teen Canada contestants so we obviously had to check it out. Unfortunately there were no underage beauty queens to be seen. Alas, we both has delicious breakfasts with fresh fruit and double smoked bacon. YUM! The coffee (or tea) was included which was nice and the service was fast and friendly. No doubt this place is an absolute zoo on the weekends so I recommend it for mid week petit dejeuner if possible. The portions are also the perfect size, leaving you completely satisfied without being overwhelming or leaving anything on your plate. Ch-Ch-Ch-Check It Out!"}
{"text":"Guacamole and Home Fries....mmmmmmm Do it.    The food is excellent here.  They have the best home fries, and surprisingly they are even better if you dip them in Guacamole.  I would also go as far as to say, that I've never tasted a better eggs benedict anywhere.  Yes, it was really that good.  I recommend Boom.  Don't be deterred by the potential line up.  You will line up anywhere you go..Golden Griddle, Cora's, Over Easy, even Tim Horton's.  They all have line ups.  The food is well executed, and the service very pleasant.  Gives you a kinda Mom and Pop shop feel.   Thats all that should really matter.  Do try it."}
{"text":"Epic Fail.  Formulaic, bland and all around uninspiring. There was nothing overtly wrong with this place but there was nothing overtly right with it either. The menu has lots of options and you can see that they're trying, as best a chain can, with their presentation. Unfortunately the food is seriously lacking in oomph.   Yes, the homefries do have a tasty coating but it's not good enough to bring us back.   If Boom was priced in the same range as diners I could rationalize another visit but they're trying to contend in a much higher bracket. For the $ you can go to an independent restaurant that has an evolving/fresh menu.  I've added a full star for the service that we received and witnessed. Every staff member that we encountered was really friendly and everyone was well attended to."}
{"text":"A refreshing take on breakfast! This place uses some unique meats like chorizo and smoked salmon to provide some new breakfast dishes to try out! Come early though because tables full up by brunch time!"}
{"text":"One of the worst breakfasts I have had in a long time. My bf has recommended against this place on several occasions but we were starving and thought it was going to be cheap based on the eye catching, misleading sign i saw as we drove by  and  I thought \"how bad could it possibly be?\" The sign advertises a breakfast for 5.99 but the fine print said mon-fri, okay - my fault,  no biggie. But things went right down hill quickly after that ... The service was pathetic, it was like we were an inconvenience to her. We each ordered the \"BOOM\" breakfast which comes with ONE piece of toast that was cold and that I had to butter - needless to say butter doesn't melt well on cold toast. The bacon was stiff and cold - sort of looked like it was cooked yesterday and made a clinking noise on my plate when tapped on the ceramic. There is no pepper on the table and have to ask for It if you'd like some. I happen to like A LOT so I asked if they could leave it at the table and the response was 'no'. The server never came back once to even ask if we wanted a top up on the coffees let alone how the meal was or if wanted anything else because I could have used more pepper more coffee and more water.... I will NEVER eat there again and if you're thinking about eating there, think again and walk a little further west to Emma's Country Kitchen and have yourself a real meal in great atmosphere with friendly service. Overall \"BOOM\" is more of a \"BOOOOO\""}
{"text":"Every time I come here I really enjoy this place from the service to the food. For anyone that enjoys potatoes please come here for their version of home fries called frites. Crispy on the outside but soft and fluffy from the inside a perfect side dish to anything that you have for breakfast.   The only concern NOT complaint since every popular restaurant deals with is it gets extremely busy and obviously that creates long line ups and long wait times. So I've made my review based on service and food."}
{"text":"Once upon a time, when I lived in little Italy, I ate at Boom at least once a month. Not because I thought it was amazing, but because it was nearby and I wanted brunch. The food's pretty good, with nice portion sizes and lots of variety - you can find standard greasy breakfast fare and something a bit healthier all in one place. The smoothies are excellent.  It's a bit more money than I'd like to spend on breakfast. I think that I'm a gal who's totally happy with a $5 standard eggs and bacon kind of deal.  It's always busy on the weekends (and many weekdays as well), so be prepared to line up and wait. I don't recall ever waiting more than 10 or 15 minutes for a table, which is not all that long, but can certainly feel like 100 years when you're peering through a cloud of last night's drinks and desperate  to get some food in your system."}
{"text":"Brunch is a weekly event and visits here are oh-so-good.  The service is friendly and the menu offers a variety of breakfast fare.  It can get busy but I've seen the servers go down the line and provide waiting customers with coffee...a nice gesture.  California Spa-Omelette was good..Oprah, not so much which was disappointing...really wanted to love the Oprah! For sure, will be back for more though."}
{"text":"Excellent place for breakfast. Make sure you eat he frites they are wonderful. It can be a little pricey for breakfast but you get what you pay for and what you're paying for is great food. During the week there are sales where you fear free coffee etc. great place to eat. Everything on the menu is worth a try"}
{"text":"There was nothing good to say. There I said it . Wait the waitress and owners were nice. But thats it.   I have eaten here a few times, its expensive for what you get , the quality of food is very low ,  bacon and sausages sit in a grill pan till they are warmed up on the grill when you order them . Bacon is thin and Hollandaise sauce is for sure from a package.   I really did try to give it a chance, but its a no go for me. I enjoy the eggs benny with Prosciutto from Il Gusto next door, they have a huge patio and fantastic menu options."}
{"text":"The \"boom frites\" are so good.  I am a picky pancake eater, but mine was actually delicious; not too soggy or too cakey.  Coffee was good.  I think the decor is really attractive.  Service was quick and attentive, and one of the guys in the kitchen noticed me hopelessly groping around for a lost earring on the floor. He pulled out his phone to use as a light and helped me look for a few minutes (to no avail) but it was a very nice gesture."}
{"text":"It was just \"okay\". I ordered the California \"spa-melette\" and half of it was burnt. My son had the eggs and bacon - hard to screw up. Kind of pricy for what you get (food and service)."}
{"text":"Just ok - not great, but passes muster.  I used to go to Boom all the time because I live in the neighbourhood, they're open early, it's fresh and clean, and it's one of the few places to get a relatively quick bite to eat that's not fast food.   The food is fine - but just fine.  I'm not a big eater but I find the breakfast small - just one piece of toast and you can't sub the frites for toast.  The coffee's often cold - esp. if you order decaf.  The smoothies are very good.  My main complaint is that the service is so variable - sometimes friendly, but mostly indifferent and sometimes uncomfortable - like they don't want you to be there - so I've stopped going recently."}
{"text":"I usually sit at the bar since it's not far from my house and the breakfast is good. The hollandaise is flavourful, I dig it. I enjoy the smoothies as well in a I'm sorry about last night liver, here's some apology nutrition kind of way.   Assuming it's not packed I would expect quick service and good food."}
{"text":"Great local spot.   I used to eat here when it first opened up.    Eaten here a few times since."}
{"text":"Ate there this morning for the first time.  Key virtue is that it was open early, which seems to be a rarity it TO.  Food was fine - my omelet was bland, the French fries are pretty solid, but my back bacon was dry and over cooked. My wife's eggs benedict was, as she put it, fine for a diner. Staff was very friendly and attentive.  At 7am, I'd go again, but not at a time when there are other options."}
{"text":"I haven't even attempted going here during breakfast time. I walked by it one day and saw the massive line so I avoided it for the longest time. One day it was around lunch time and I was walking by and decided to go in. I have been back a few times since. I really like it. I've had an omelette and french toast. It was all very good.  And the waitstaff are all very friendly."}
{"text":"I've been here for brunch more times than I can count and have not been disappointed.  Their quality food and service is consistent and it has become my go-to brunch spot when in the area. Their breakfast sausage = favourite."}
{"text":"Boom is an OK spot for a quick, no surprises breakfast. They've got a good take out menu for a quick egg sandwich, and the place is pretty clean."}
{"text":"Honestly I came here for the reviews. Nothing special, overrated if you ask me. I ordered the peameal bacon with eggs. The bacon was overcooked and hard to chew. The fries were very bland and nothing special. I could make a better breakfast at home. I ended up going to starbucks after to grab a sandwich because I was still hungry."}
{"text":"Nous y sommes allés une seule fois pour se faire claquer la porte au nez : \"ah non on ne sert plus, c'est fermé\" - genre 15 minutes avant leur heure de fermeture. On aurait préféré le sourire, un 'désolé' pour la forme. On ne demandait pas une exception, juste un peu plus de courtoisie. Ça compte car nous n'y sommes jamais retournés."}
{"text":"I think Sunset Grill is better but here you're paying more for ambience and trend factor plus it's the place to be in the neighbourhood on a weekend morning.  Typical breakfast menu."}
{"text":"Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day, but I was disappointed with Boom Breakfast considering the high ratings and good reviews on various sites - I was there once about a month ago, and stopped in again today - I don't remember what irked me the first time, but the smoked pork loin they served with my breakfast today was thin (and spoiled) - The Boom frites were much better than the frozen potato puffs many restaurants serve these days, but did not make up for the spoiled meat - The breakfast includes one slice of toast instead of two, so if you like your toast, you will need to order extra on the side - The only thing they do that sets them apart as far as I'm concerned, is that the pepper is fresh ground by the waiter; but they really need to leave a pepper shaker on the table in case customers decide they need a bit more"}
{"text":"I'll keep it short and simple.  Food is plain and boring. Service is alright. Place is pricey, way overpriced for the quality of food they produce.  Walk down the street to Emma's.  The only time I ever come here is when I settle, and even then it disappoints me."}
{"text":"Consistently disappointing. Latest trip waited 10 minutes in a not-full restaurant to be seated. 15 minutes after being seated we finally got coffee (which is weak and yucky). Corn syrup instead of maple syrup and pancakes from a box + McCain Superfries? You make one meal, Boom and you can't make any of it from scratch? Bacon was cold, floppy and greasy. When it was sent back to be cooked and warmed came back to us with the bite we'd taken out. So basically they put a half-eaten piece of bacon, germs and all on the grill and then re-served it? Server was slow, basically friendly but honestly 15 mins for a cup of coffee is too long. Do yourselves a favour and stick to Emma's down the street. I thought there was a price difference - there isn't - just a huge difference in quality, flavour and service. Yikes."}
{"text":"If you're unwise enough to go out for breakfast at peak hour (9:30-11), especially to a popular place, then of course you're going to wait in line.  Try going here between 7 and 9 and enjoy all the great stuff people are saying but also enjoy a quiet atmosphere and some leisure.  Some comments refer to boom as a chain, but it's not.  I've met the owner.  It's a family run business... a different sibling at each location.  Here's a tip... ask for a second slice of toast and it comes free.  They just don't want to carb load you if you don't want it ;)  They do cook eggs to perfection.  I think the prices are reasonable... they use quality ingredients and they serve it with love.    My wife and I have had everything on the breakfast menu... my favourite is the threesome.  Scrambled eggs on a pancake with bacon.  Another reliable favourite of mine is the power breakfast (with a second slice of toast).  Unfortunately coffee is a side item and not included with breakfast... but it's bottomless.  They've had issues in the past with inexperienced hostesses...  kudos to management for identifying it quickly and ploughing forward until they found the right person."}
{"text":"I stopped by Boom for brunch based on my date's recommendation.  My date describes this place as less 'yellow' [1] than most breakfast/brunch joints, I was sold and we had to check it out.  Food  Farmer Gianni - yummy veggie omelet, the home fries were awesome, not too greasy with the right crispness and seasoning.  I really liked the fruit that accompanied the dish  Eggs Florentine - got to split my breakfast with his and I tried his eggs Florentine.  The egg was perfectly poached and the hollandaise sauce was just right.  I preferred the eggs Florentine to my omelet.  Coffee was above average and I got several refills while we dined  Service  Quick and attentive.  I was surprised how quickly our dishes came out shortly after we ordered.  The only downside is that you have to pay at the cash before you leave.  Not sure if this is a downside, but I like the full service payment when I dine out.  If you are in the Italy area, this place is definitely worth checking out!  They have smoothies on the menu too!   [1] Yellow scale is the level of oiliness, Denny's would be high on the oiliness scale"}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast with my aunt.  I had a breakfast burrito and cup of coffee.  Both we enjoyable but the burrito was a bit small.  Tasted very good however.  Very average sort of diner/restaurant."}
{"text":"I like Boom's breakfast.  It always has lineups on weekends, but they're pretty efficient so things move along fairly quickly.  As I'm sitting waiting for my order (not for very long), I often wonder how in a place that's so cramped and hectic, they don't have more collisions, and how the staff all seem so relaxed and friendly.  A good selection on the menu and I've always been pleased with my order.  Eggs not too runny, bacon nice and crispy, a variety of wholesome breads to choose from, and the frites are very tasty, even if they are McCain."}
{"text":"They have a wide selection which makes it easier when you are eating with a group.  Their eggs benny are served with a slice of melon, which is cute.  A lot of places within the same price range seem to keep it as simple as possible to minimize cost.  As others have pointed out, there tends to be a line up (I've never had to wait more than 5 minutes) but that's the thing about Boom or any other small restaurant.  If you have a group of more than 4, you should find a larger restaurant to dine at or arrive earlier.  When you travel in 2's, it's always easier for my daughter and I to be seated.  I've enjoyed everything I tried here.  It's the basic breakfast/brunch choices. Nothing rare but the draw of the place is knowing you will get a hearty meal cooked up on the traditional flat diner grills."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  A few elements detract from the enjoyment of this clean, efficient breakfast spot. First is the \"chain\" vibe...for good reason - it is part of a chain. Next is smaller details like their breakfast potato. They are frozen \"frites\", which are really just spiced wedge french fries. Lastly, the (single piece of!) toast doesn't come buttered (as in virtually all other breakfast places), but is supplied in a wasteful, plastic container.  That said, they have a competitively priced standard breakfast...a huge menu if the standard breakfast doesn't grab you, and they'll even do eggs 'n onions!   The coffee was above average, the multi-grain toast was great, and they serve espresso-based drinks, if you're so inclined."}
{"text":"Geez, I shouldn't have let this go 3 days before reviewing...memory...fading.      Met 3 friends here, we all enjoyed it.  I had the omelet with spinach, roasted red peppers and some kind of cheese.  It was very good.  The \"frites\" were somewhere between french and home fries.  Tasty.  The multi-grain toast was top shelf.  Would have gotten 3.5 stars, but for the FRESH GROUND PEPPER.  Of the 40 or so breakfast places I've reviewed (see list below), this was a first."}
{"text":"Fairly average food even by diner standards, though the food is brought out very quickly and the waitstaff are efficient and pleasant.  There is an issue with bee's on the patio and inside, the problem with bees inside is due to people waiting to be seated holding the door open."}
{"text":"This is a nice place for a casual brunch with some friends. Like most brunch places, they don't take reservations so you have to line up. But what I liked was that we were given snacks and coffee while in line! It's a small but thoughful gesture. The food was decent and our server was attentive. Plus I liked that we weren't rushed in and out."}
{"text":"Boom.... I wouldn't have guessed this little hole in the wall would have been all the rage but alas, I was wrong. I was fortunate enough to sit in one of the booths (children in the back half that looked all to enthusiastic may have made me miserable). It looked so clean and sleek in this joint from front to back, top to bottom.   While the server didn't seem all that thrilled to be well, serving, the food was incredible and the smoothies even better. I am so happy that Auntie's and Uncles were closed on Sunday so I could try out this \"new to me\" place.   I highly recommend the Kiss a dillas and the Honey Smoothie.   The price is right and the food is delish.   Boom Boom. ( that's breakfast language for thumbs up)"}
{"text":"This place is best to check out during a weekday as it's a zoo on the weekends. Breakfast was good but standard - nothing different or amazing. Tons of options to choose from though . Food portion is just right and the service was very good. Again the food isn't memorable but it'll fuel you up for sure!"}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant after a cousin recommended it to us. We have no clue what they saw in this place because the food was mediocre and the wait staff, while very friendly, were extremely overworked. I put the blame on management - not our server - forgetting to bring our drinks. The pancakes looked and tasted like they came from pancake mix and my omelette was way overcooked. Food was overpriced for the portions and quality.  There are only two redeeming qualities about this place. The space lets in a lot of sunlight and it's very wheelchair friendly."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast on thanksgiving Sunday morning. We were a bit discouraged by the lineup that met us when we arrived, but the line moved very quickly. We were served cut up pieces of waffle while we waited.   When it was time to order, we both got what I would consider to be a standard breakfast. We got eggs, toast, homefries, and sausages. We also got one waffle which we shared.   The home fries were quite possibly the best I've ever had. They were cooked well (I hate biting into a fry and getting that hard, uncooked potato feeling in my mouth) they were also seasoned to perfection. We got two sausages each, and boy were they huge. I feel like each sausage was equivalent to like 3 regular breakfast sausages. They were delicious.   The waffle...my God the waffle. It was just heavenly. It was just soft and fluffy and amazing.   The toast and the eggs were great as well.   The service was great. The host at the front was very nice and our server was funny-attentive but not over the top.   I definitely recommend this place if you're looking for your standard diner breakfast done WELL. :)"}
{"text":"The best breakfast i've ever had! Where else can you get a veggie burger and yam fries for breakfast! It's delicious too! The wait staff is always friendly, though there is often a long line free coffee is usually offered. I am a big fan of the egg crepe with hollandaise! To die for! always filling and delicious. There are so many great menu options. You've got to go! Go During the week to miss the line!"}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend here yesterday for a birthday brunch. I don't get down to this spot often because on weekends the line up is crazy but it was a Tuesday. We enjoyed a lovely brunch, I had the canadian eggs bennedict and my boyfriend had an omlette. Eggs were cooked perfectly and the hollandaise was delicious. I also really like their homefries. Service was excellent. I love this place, except on the weekend when the line is out the door."}
{"text":"Boom Breakfast Co is our favourite breakfast place so far. Convenient for us users of the 512 streetcar line, good ambience, good service, good food.  As the other reviewers already said, there's always a line. It's not a hype, it is really a nice place.  Whatever you order there, don't miss their home fries, they are awesome. I don't know what they put on them to make them taste so good.  I also like their espresso, their pancakes and waffles.  If there's a better place for breakfast around... I have yet to know."}
{"text":"Breakfast at Boom is good.  Is it worth lining up for?  Not really.  Presentation is great, Boom frites are mighty tasty, eggs cooked to perfection.  But, it is a good solid breakfast place, not outstanding.  Their coffee is very strong...might be able to clean out your organs with a cup.  I had the huevos, and it was fair- not a traditional huevos, it was in a wrap.  The guac was pretty good.  Friends I was with had Tuscan eggs and 2 eggs over medium.  They had been to Boom before and were big fans.  Dunno - maybe it was built up for me and didn't live up to its expectations.    You do see the kitchen staff and they work like crazy!  They earn their wages that is for sure....actually....I am sure they could all use raises!!  If had choice, would prefer to go to Le Gourmand for breakfast."}
{"text":"Service is subpar but the food is great. I had the eggs benny with ham. The home fries are probably the best I've had.   The place can get busy but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Average chain restaurant experience. Food is good but obviously on the more expensive side compared to breakfast at mom & pop shops but Boom is open on Sundays - which I don't recommend because it gets super packed, line up is crazy. The entrance isn't designed the best for this.   I came in this Sunday. Service was mediocre. Our server forgot my tea. Took her 20 minutes to bring it. Another 30 minutes to bring our food. She actually never introduced herself so I never got her name.  Point is - average food, a bit on the pricier side. If you want breakfast, go for it."}
{"text":"Shitty, snotty waitresses who forget they're waitresses. Awesome cheap food. Service is fast and attentive but always with a sigh and an eye roll. Totally worth it for me tho, food is always good."}
{"text":"My lantern held high, I continue my search for the Perfect Breakfast Diner Within a Fifteen-Minute Walk From My Home.  Alas, today was not the day.    Boom Breakfast & Co. has a lot going for it, believe me.  Bright, sunny room (but not too bright), big menu, quick & pleasant service, and good food.  The Boom fries are delicious.    It doesn't quite make it because it's a) too noisy, b) too briskly efficient, and c) a hair too expensive.  I want to have the option of lingering over my tea (and it's a nice touch if that tea is included in your two-egg breakfast), but the pace is too quick for that to feel comfortable, and too loud for a romantic breakfast chat.  The portions are not as large as I'm used to, which may not be a bad thing, but one piece of toast instead of two feels like skimping.    Maybe I should go back and try the eggs benny?"}
{"text":"Pros : Great food and Lina (the server) very nice just love her attitude.I would recommend Acapulco gold or High protein omelet off the menu. Home fries are scrumptious :) but not good for you but who cares?!  Cons: This place has great breakfast so expectedly they will have a wait no problem! The staff is usually joking around and not being as attentive to their tables sometimes which is causing a delay in patrons leaving. Sometimes you have to wait a while before they check on you or refill your coffee, bill etc. The place is very tiny with many servers so there is no excuse for this. When you are standing at a crowded door and can clearly see many tables with customers who are clearly done but waiting and servers having a good time in the back it is kind of off putting. The guy that takes your name isn't good at keeping track and will often seat people that come after you before you.  I still go regardless because it is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Service was slow. Food was not great. I prefer Sunset Grill a couple blocks west.;"}
{"text":"(3.5/5) fairly good,  but pricey.  First off this place opens earlier than most on a Saturday morning so it is a good option for early risers.  Once you settle in and look at their menu,  you will see quite a vast array of yummy options. The egg florentine and smoke salmon (Benny Boom) is tasty and their pancakes are light,  fluffy and sweet.   However,  the fruit accompaniments left much to desire.  The service was fair, however our waitress could have been a little more attentive (note this was first visit). The prices are noticeably high which makes this an expensive breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Breakfast was good but standard - nothing different or amazing. Tons of options to choose from though . Food portion is just right and the service was  good. Again the food isn't memorable but it'll fuel you up for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty decent.  I almost always get the eggs bennys, and they're dependably delicious.  The only downside to this place is the angry male waiter.  If you've been there, you'll know who I'm talking about.  His service is alright, but he never smiles, and has an attitude that makes me feel unwelcome.  I have seen him completely lose it on several of his coworkers on one visit in particular.  I get that people have bad days, and sometimes coworkers mess up, but I don't think that gives anyone the right to yell at someone in front of a busy restaurant.  That said, I've never had poor service from the other staff.  Just one bad egg, I guess."}
{"text":"I was staying close to this restaurant for a work event. Ate here each morning and they were very helpful in substituting for all my allergies. I had egg omelette with fruit and grilled tomatoes. I also ordered a smooth.  I was pleasantly surprised with the great service and food."}
{"text":"A whole lot of \"meh\". The fact that you have to line up like cattle, be presented mediocre, uninspired breakfast and then be rushed out the door makes for a very lacklustre experience overall."}
{"text":"I wanted to like Boom more than I did, the space has a very cute diner vibe going as you make your way through the narrow section between the open kitchen and the dining area towards the back of the restaurant. Staff was friendly service was more quick than not and by that I mean it took them a good amount of time to bring us our coffee than it did our food (relatively speaking). Weekdays are apparently the best time to do breakfast here as they have a very cheap special including complimentary coffee.   One of the big reasons I didn't fall in love with Boom was that they serve coffee in the standard small coffee cups but fail to refill it regularly. It was after I was done eating that they came over for the first refill. I wouldn't complain too much about this if I had come in on a weekday and was being served free coffee but for $2.50 I was expecting either better coffee or more refills. Thankfully Boom sits right next to the lit coffee shop so I was able to properly satisfy my caffeine craving next door.   The actual food is what saves this place for me. I'm not a big fan of the large quantities of grease big name breakfast chains serve up (although I know that for some that is part of the draw). My meal here which consisted of fries, bacon (one piece of toast) and 2 eggs was just the right amount for me and none of it felt disgustingly gross. So props for them for doing food right.   I would come in here on a weekday for sure but on a weekend I would rather skip out."}
{"text":"One of my favourite brunch places...  It's little, quaint, filled with friendly staff, great food at even better prices - really, what more can you ask for??  I've tried almost everything on the menu.  Huevo Rancheros (YUM), 2 egg breakfast, Eggs Benny, smoothies - it's all good.   Once my Huevo Ranchero was a bit runny but they made a new one for me, no biggie!  They have AWESOME home fries and tomatoe sides.  It's like a hearty home cooked meal at a restaurant, no fancy bells and whistles, but just good and hearty.  Tip:  - If you go on a weekend, you may want to plan on waiting for a bit, the line up does get pretty long but they do get em in and out pretty fast."}
{"text":"I really liked it. It's nice to have something local that's not Cora's or Fran's.   I got the eggs benny and it was very good and perfectly cooked egg. Their home fries are amazing. I'm goign back at some point to try the crispy french toast.   we had a bit of a wait at 1pm on a saturday for 2 people, but it wasn't long.  It's a small place, but they manage.  Staff was nice, not terrible."}
{"text":"I've been here 3-4 times because my boyfriend loves it and we're in the area. I've ordered something different each time and have never been wowed (hence never ordered the same thing twice). I personally like Emma's Country Kitchen much better. It's not horrible here though, the food is ok and the servers are nice ish."}
{"text":"I'm a vegetarian and got the \"super lite breakfast\" which included an egg in your preferred style, a small bowl of fruit, a tiny roasted tomato, toast with butter, and a small piece of fior di latte cheese. I usually don't enjoy eggs very much because they come boiled with noodles, leaving the yolk extremely dry but I got my egg over-easy style and it was just perfect. The fruit and toast were great, as expected. The tiny roasted tomato was tasty as well. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the cheese. I assume all fior di latte cheese is that style but it was nearly tasteless and watered down. On the other hand, their service was good. I feel that I got my food at the right time and the waiter was nice and memorized our order then quickly punched it in. Overall, it was a good dining experience and I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"What do you think of when you hear the word BOOM? Something loud, explosive, bold and big? When you relate the word with food you perhaps expect new flavors, new preparations, or big portions.  You don't really get any of that. You get a pretty standard breakfast.Granted, the ingredients they use are fresh and they do have a few minor twists on a few dishes. On average, it's standard fare but done well and properly.   Something different that they offer is a chicken Eggs Benedict, which uses a grilled chicken breast instead of the typical smoked salmon or ham.  Overall, Boom makes good breakfast/brunch. Selection, preparation,and proportions are decent. The location is homey and comfortable. That being said, Boom offers your typical meal and meets expectations but didn't surpass mine by any stretch."}
{"text":"Been to this boom a bunch of times and the food is always consistently good, however not the same can be said about the service.  Usually get the same girl who is awesome but have had a mixed bag from angry looking abrupt middle aged woman to guy-don't-giveacrap.  But this is by far on the off days. Would recommend if you live in the area."}
{"text":"Boom is a good place to go if you're looking for a classic breakfast. The pancakes, the Bennys, the eggs, the omelettes, the frites (which you can substitute for sweet potato fries at no charge), the meats, the sandwiches, the smoothies, the drinks... everything is good. The waffles are particularly delicious!   Service is always great, I've never had a bad experience there.  Bonus point for being open on most holidays when other restaurants are closed!"}
{"text":"Originally wanted to check out Emma's, but it was packed (and a 45 minute wait) so we walked over to Boom. I've been to their other locations around the city - it's your pretty standard breakfast menu here. The food items are pretty reasonably priced. I ordered a smoothie with my meal (chick-a-dilla); for $5, it was a little expensive. Anyway, I work near the Yonge-Eglinton Boom so I'll be going there instead of this location.  Good for: breakfast"}
{"text":"I was here for a breakfast meeting last week. The food was fine. It's hard to screw up eggs and bacon. I'm avoiding wheat at the moment so I ordered no toast. It didn't occur to me that the fried potatoes listed on the menu would be covered in floury batter. Where I'm from those things aren't called fried potatoes, they are called potato wedges or taters. Why can't things be labled clearly? Anyway, it's my own fault, I should have asked. The service was ok. The only hiccup was when I had to ask three times for splenda before the server brought it. I don't even know why they hide it in the back. If they put it on the table with the sugar the whole thing could have been avoided. This place is average. Nice if you want to sit down with a friend and have breakfast. Nothing fancy to see here, though."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times, the service is lovely but unfortunately the food isn't the greatest. I've gotten exactly what I ordered each time I came but it's just kind of... underwhelming. They have a very large menu so there's plenty of options, maybe I just haven't been ordering the right things? Unfortunately I don't think I'll be going back to this location, but I got a stamp card so I might return to another."}
{"text":"Our server was very good. The food was amazing. We were offered coffee while waiting for our table. They had great gluten free options which were not clearly advertised  so I was pleasantly surprised. The bread was delicious, not Bland and Styrofoam-like as some gluten free breads at restaurants are. We did not expect much as boom is a chain and we've had issues in the past with service at the eglinton location. Will come back again!"}
{"text":"So my friends live in the area around here (Wychwood Heights its called? I unno. St Clair West seems better..)and this is their go - to spot for brunch. I suggested we go to Brunhworks, but they told me this place was a lot cheaper, so $$$ yes.  We waited about 45 minutes for a table in that super cramped little area. That was a mission and a half on its own..plus the cost of being hungover and it was snowing outside (As usual) so I wasn't the happiest per say.   Anyways, we sat down to a cute booth (super props to them fro having a booth that I actually fit into..super props for that)  We had :  1. The Westtern Sandwich - This was.. okay. The eggs were overcooked for my taste, and there wasn't a top of toppings. The bread could've used some butter, but yea. The boom frites were amazing though. Super super super good.  2. The Chick-a-dilla - This was a a breakfast quesidilla I guess. It was quite tiny I guess, bbut the guac was AWESOME.  3. The Power Breakfast - Standard fare  4. My friend's Omelette.- didn't get to try this.  The place is cute, but the breakfast was under-whelming. The servers were super super cute though.  Don't come here during the rush rush hours like we did, but it's a decent place I guess. We'll be back here soon"}
{"text":"Food - very hearty and filling. I really enjoyed my High Energy omelettes - and yes, I did get a nice boost of energy after eating them. Prices were reasonable given the quality of the food.  Service - pretty standard. Servers were friendly and attentive.  Ambiance - a bit sad given the fluorescent lighting and location but I suppose you can't do much about it ¯\_(?)_/¯"}
{"text":"What a nice surprise to find this so close to my house! I went on a weekday and it was pretty empty. They have a great mon-thurs $5.99 deal with 2 eggs, toast, tomato, coffee/tea and orange juice! I got that and it was so tasty and everyone was really nice and it was so clean! Really great service I will definitely be going back for more on weekdays."}
{"text":"BOOM specializes in up selling. Had breakfast there the other day and a \"seasoned\" waitress was teaching a newbie right beside our booth. Every second word from the seasoned teacher was UP SELL.  And boy, did they up sell. We each had the regular breakfast, which reading reviews was $7.29, supposedly including coffee. I splurged and ordered REAL maple syrup instead of the plastic stuff ($1.99). Don't understand how our bill ended up over 30 bucks. Certainly wasn't because we ordered any extra, like a second piece of toast. Puny packets of jam and butter, no sweet and low. All I could think of was some investor in Forest Hill raking in the profits. Never again."}
{"text":"This place is so popular that you are almost guaranteed to wait in line for breakfast.  Already, that sorta sucks, but the people at Boom know how much waiting sucks, and they make up for it by every so often coming around with samples of muffins.  At least you don't have to starve while you wait.  When you finally get to take a seat, I must say that I've often been annoyed by how slow the service is.  I mean, sure, it could be much worse, but when  you sit there for 15 minutes before someone comes to take your order, you quickly realize why there's always a line.  And finally, the food.  It's good.  I can't deny it.  I've come back here because the food is really worth it.  Granted, not the best eggs I've had, but their potatoes on the side are easily the best I've had with breakfast.    If it weren't for the wait, I'd probably be here more often."}
{"text":"Excellent service, great food, good prices, and well air-conditioned! I highly recommend this place for Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"This place was nice but the service lacked a bit and the food failed. Bread was stale, egg not prepared as ordered, half the ingredients listed on menu did not make it to the plate. This is a definite pass."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and thought it was pretty alright. There's been a couple of times where I felt like the waitress had better things to do than serve me food. I always hate that feeling -- Like I am some sort of burden.  The food is decent, but I feel like it's overpriced. Something like eggs and sausage with some toast shouldn't be 7-8 dollars in my opinion. When the food arrives the quality looks about as decent as Golden Griddle or Denny's. Maybe I'm just ordering the wrong thing. Would be nice if there was just that one-more-thing to add a little zest to the plate.  The atmosphere is kind of nice. I like sitting in a booth and having some breakfast food. Location is also good as it's close to my hood and there's not really many options for breakfast or brunch in the area. They just need to either drop the prices a little or spruce up the orders because what you pay for isn't quite worth it."}
{"text":"We love coming here, this was our go to spot for like 5 years. But this time the start was awkward.   We walk in, no one greeted us, so a girl-from behind the counter noticed us awkwardly standing there and  asked me how many, and then she gave me an option to sit. Right after another waitress/ hostess with short black hair, an older lady comes running over, (she's been working here for some time, and is not always very nice) and rudely degrades the only person who acknowledged us awaiting our seats. And then repeats the question to us, as if her coworker wasn't competent enough. Which was horrible, the girl behind the counter seemed embarrassed. I feel really terrible for her, and I am happy that at least she noticed us. Thank you.  The way you treat your coworkers really shows how you value people. Such an awful experience. As a mature adult, she should know better than that.   The food is really good, our second waitress was extremely nice. I'm glad we didn't get the first one again.  Ps the prices have gone up crazily, about 20$ per person!"}
{"text":"After searching through a list of brunch spots my friend and I stumbled upon Boom and were pleasantly surprised. It is very small inside, but we were seated in a back area that was a lot more spacious. They have a great selection of breakfast and brunch items and after going back and forth between their pancakes, Canadian Sausage, French Toast, and eggs I decided on the Sausage Eh. The Sausage Eh came with their amazing Canadian Sausage, toast, frites, and eggs. Everything was so full of flavor--not too salty or bland, but just right. This also applies to their service. Our waitress was not too overly attentive or ignored us, but was just right. She knew we wanted to order one of their drink specials at 11am (yes they have drink specials at 11am--yeah), so she came back around, checked in on us, and got our order. What was even cooler one of the managers decided to make us a special drink for the same price as their offered drink special that included rum, vodka, and ginger ale with strawberries on the top. It was amazingly good and amazingly strong.   All of the food we ordered and drinks only added up to $22CA, so not bad for brunch in Toronto. Definitely check this spot out!"}
{"text":"God bless friends that move into new neighbourhoods.  You get to go visit, bring a housewarming house plant, and then hit up places to eat and drink that you've not been to.  A day or night of exploring commences.  Thankfully we showed up at my pal's new place just in time for brunch, and off we went to Boom.  Which was awesome.  As I'd never heard of the place.  The décor is that of a brightly designed café, with counter service available as well as booths and tables at the rear of the restaurant.  You know you're hitting a decent brunch place in Toronto when you're greeted with a line-up out the door.  It's a pain in the arse, but hey, it's a sad sign of quality.  We did our part, formed the orderly queue, and waited for our table.  Fret not, they tend to get people through there pretty quickly.  It is also equipped with one of the more interesting menus for brunch that I've seen in Toronto.  The usual staples of egg, bacon, sausage, peameal, are all there for the taking.  There's also other egg and non-egg based breakies to fill you and get your weekend started.  Oh, and they don't just do weekends.  This place is open for breakfast seven days a week, so slide by for a full on feedbag, or just a quick breakfast sandwich to go on your way to work.  Who says your only breakie sandwich option is a McMuffin.  Sod that.  Go Boom."}
{"text":"Ordered the steak and eggs, I pretty much filled myself up with the McCain Wedges and eggs, the steak looked like it was boiled no flavour and half of it was fat.   Not worth the 50 bucks for two people."}
{"text":"Took the trolley for a little adventure from downtown while we were visiting Toronto on a family vacation. This is a great find and worth the short trip there. Waitstaff was great and the menu is awesome- varied and not just normal breakfast if you want something different but also has normal and expected breakfast fare. Kids loved the smoothies and the pancakes (which were nice and thick and good) and my wife loved the crunchy French toast with a great big fruit bowl that was very fresh. The serving sizes were on the big side so come hungry. All in all just a great cool little breakfast place that should be on your map if you are anywhere close to downtown Toronto! Loved it."}
{"text":"I dunno...I was expecting GREAT but it was just OK.  We ordered a reasonably priced Ceasar. WHY OH WHY  was it mostly (very) watered down Clamato  and if there was vodka, we sure didn't taste it. Bleh. I love my brunch Ceasars but this one was hard to finish.   Moving on.   My meal was NYC lox and scramble. When it arrived I was quite disappointed. The Nanook salmon had been sauteed into the eggs!  If  I had known that, I would never have ordered it. I was expecting the nice fresh taste of smoked salmon and of course, didn't get that at all. The bagel was poppyseed (no choice of variety), cream cheese would have been a nice addition but not offered as part of the meal.  The home fries were delicious. And service was good!"}
{"text":"My mother and ordered a breakfast with a side of pancakes. The breakfast was fantastic. But the pancakes were terrible. It was clearly a mix with water. Yuck.  The server was fantastic. She took very good care of us and even suggested a better option price wise for what we wanted."}
{"text":"Very nice diner.  Great food and service.  It can get busy on the weekends so come early."}
{"text":"Went to boom because the line up was too long at Emma's Kitchen. One thing I like about our area is the abundant choices for sunday brunch. Asked the host what is the most popular dishes and was recommended to have the Boom Benny and Apprentice Burger. I had the Benny and it was not impressive. The smoked salmon did not taste fresh. The hollandaise was plain.The english muffin was hard to cut through.  I did appreciate that it had fresh spinach on top of perfectly cooked egg and the Boom frite had an awesome taste. I had a bite of the apprentice burger. I thought it was ok. They did cook the egg on it just as how my gf like it, over medium. My gf did not think the salad was fresh and the sweet potato fries tasted similar to McCain fries. Overall, it wasn't that great."}
{"text":"So, why is this place called Boom? I came here about a month or so ago for breakfast, friend's choice. I thought it was cute when I arrived and we sat in the front window so we had plenty of space (or as much as you can get in a small restaurant). It has a diner vibe but isn't quite gritty enough to be one. I know this place is a small chain and the menu reminded me of Cora's a bit - laminated with the funny names, all that was missing was the crazy fruit concoctions.   The server wasn't my favourite. She was a little abrupt with my gluten free companion when she tried to discuss toast options and generally not very warm. I ordered a vegetarian omelette and she did let me substitute a few things. Sadly, this has to have been one of the worst omelettes I've ever eaten. I don't know what they did to it but it did not taste good. Even copious amounts of ketchup couldn't revive it. I was really quite hungry but I couldn't stomach it. The most enjoyable part of my meal was the potatoes - they were actually quite good. I picked at the fruit (melon which wasn't quite ripe), ate my friend's potatoes (she ordered extra and couldn't finish them) and thus it turned out to be quite a carby, ketchup breakfast.   Place was clean, washrooms fine, they bring you the bill and you have to pay at the counter. But hey, it's all about the food and since I really disliked mine I doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"It's really hard to mess up breakfast food and this place delivers. Been here a few times and every item I have ordered was great. Quick and attentive service, reasonable prices, great for breakfast."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Inviting and friendly decor and staff but the food..it's okay... A bit overpriced. The place looks great and is a welcome addition to the St. Clair W strip but not the best value for your money. The line-ups on the weekend tell you that the area is desperate for a good place though. They should watch their back at Boom, because someone else with a little flair and better value could steal that line easily."}
{"text":"Food is great, wait times and service are awful. Our waiter forgot about our French toast and then gave it to us after it sat on the counter for 15 minutes, and then argued about taking it off the bill or bringing a newly made order. These are basic customer service skills...."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our breakfast here. Went on a weekday morning with my boyfriend, and the service was fast and very good!  I had the sausage, eh and my boyfriend had the breakfast burrito. We left feeling very satisfied!"}
{"text":"Came here with some colleagues post night shift at 8 am on a Monday. Considering that many of us had worked three night shifts, our server acted as if she had just finished five shifts. She was very abrupt and was constantly making snide comments. When asked what teas they had, she would roll her eyes. She continued to give us many eye rolls and was huffing as if she was very busy (mind you, we were the only patrons). Her sarcasm, attitude, and forgetfullness definitely made our breakfast experience very negative.  The menu has many breakfast options which suited our groups taste. Some meals came with free coffee/tea from Monday to Friday.   The price was $10 + for 2 eggs, meat, and home fries, the food was ok, nothing special. I would have rated it higher, however the service was absolutely awful. If you've had a rough day and choose to come here, I hope you won't have the same server that we did."}
{"text":"This is a cozy little restaurant in the heart of TO's Little Italy. Decent enough place. I had my Latin breakfast of Nuevo Ranchero. It's the 1st time I've tried this. I was mildly impressed. It's basically a scrambled egg wrap. It came with guacamole/sour cream & salsa that appeared to be house made. The meal came with house made breakfast potatoes which were very tasty. The service was very good, the food was average. Nothing bad to say. It was average."}
{"text":"The first thing I noticed about Boom was the line up. It wasn't terribly long, but it was there. However, we were seated very quickly. The service is prompt and friendly, which is a nice thing in a place so busy. Where Boom really shines is in the food. I had the BennyBOOM; essentially, eggs benny with smoked salmon and spinach. I'll be honest, I hesitated a bit in ordering it. In the past, other places have been over generous in their salmon and that has been the only flavour I could get out of the dish. This was not the case. The salmon was not overpowering, but perfectly complimented the spinach and hollandaise, also not too much. Their frites are just great. The best way to put it, I think, is to say that they take the disgusting potato wedges fom the supermarket and make them how they ought to be, as if the objects themselves were brought back into the cave to replace the shadows. Perhaps Plato is a nicer reference than the supermarket. Their lattés are good and I quite enjoyed mine. The only real caveat has been previously mentioned, that it is a bit on the hectic, noisy side. However, that's not enough reason to stay away."}
{"text":"Great food, quick service. Though it feels a bit cramped, that's secondary to the food -- unless your claustrophobic..."}
{"text":"Had the oh canada eggs Benny it was amazing! Home fries great. Cappuccino was tasty. Server was super friendly. Great experience!"}
{"text":"I went for a 6km walk this morning and Boom Breakfast & Company was along my route.  I've passed by it lots of times but have never stopped it.  I was hungry so had breakfast there.  Pancakes are something I rarely have so I ordered Wild Blueberry Pancakes ... and they were good.  They were light and fluffy and the blueberries were plentiful and sweet.  I'd get these pancakes.  The servers were friendly and quick.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"VIBE  Bright and \"Breakfasty,\" Boom Breakfast & Company welcomes you in quickly and proceeds to get you a seat. I was surprised because at 11 a.m. on a Saturday most brunch places would have a line up so it was nice not to wait.  I quite like the yellow egg murals they have in the back area. Service is friendly and brief.   WE ATE  The Boom Benny. Salmon and spinach are the accessories on this Benny. It's not the best benny I've had but it satiated the hunger. The homefries have this seasoning that make them addictive. On top of that, the dish is served with pineapple, an orange and melon.   The freshly squeezed orange juice is overpriced at $4 for the glass. It would be nice to have a small or large option.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  Not the biggest BOOM but a small hum to get the day going. It's a good option with the lack of breakfast places in the College/Ossington area."}
{"text":"Okay, so Boom gets a bad rap because it's a bit of a chain (3 locations, all in Toronto), and the food is very traditional, BUT, those traditional dishes are always served hot, fresh, and exactly as expected.  Sure I love the cute boutique brunch places with unique dishes, who doesn't?  But sometimes...sometimes I want to order french toast, and know that I'm going to get thick sliced texas toast, dipped in cinnamon seasoned egg and served up right!  Or blueberry pancakes without any sort of fancy obscure topping, etc, etc. The key word here is TRADITIONAL.  No surprises!  The staff at this location are always super friendly.  Service is quick, as is turnaround, and the coffee isn't bad either.  If you're looking for breakfast the way your mom used to make it, hit up boom and enjoy your meal.  If you want a new, refreshing take on an old dish, look elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Nothing special but definitely decent for a simple breakfast. They've got tons of breakfast items (all the classics you would hope for and some innovative dishes as well). Bottomless coffee. Cheap and simple."}
{"text":"I thought this place was okay, the food is cheap and decent. Our server was really nice and despite being busy made sure to check in with us. I found it to be sort of run of the mill menu and kind of bland, I'll probably explore other places rather than return."}
{"text":"Since I'm in a new neighbourhood I had to find a new breakfast joint ASAP - and while I\"m not sure Boom is my \"it\" spot, it was still a decent breakfast!  What I love about Boom:   - Clean! So clean and new looking - Service! We were seated right away and had attentive but not overbearing  - Food! Big menus, and delicious food! - Eggs! They get their own category separate from food because they were AWESOME! Easily the best eggs I have ever had. I'm serious. They have frying eggs down to a science!   The points that take away from Boom are really small, but so annoying to me that they did affect my experience:   - Toast! Only one piece of bread?! What's up with that? I need at least two slices! This took away from my egg enjoyment! - Coffee! Slow on the coffee refills - Price! a little pricey for what I got, honestly - but if I had got that second piece of toast I would have let it go....   SO I will be back, but I'll keep looking for my dream spot!"}
{"text":"Boom is for breakfast not for brunch. Starving Artist is for hipsters, Emma's is for yuppies, and Boom is for swilling two coffees and skimming the front page while lamenting that had there been any pea meal in the house you could have made this breakfast at home.  Fast, moderately filling, and slightly overpriced, the portions are always a bit stingy and the food never better than average. Boom will survive as long as the stretch between Dufferin and Bathurst lacks a Vesta Lunch equivalent."}
{"text":"Late breakfast around 12pm (can't remember exact time) on a Sunday. 3 guests (including myself).  Service: It was my friend's birthday and I told the waiter that as I ordered the Morning Glory and during the entire meal he was so nice. And not in a saccharine way, he sweetly asked her what her plans were for her big day. I thought it was cute. Food took a little while to come but it was really busy.  Food: I didn't try the other two's meals but mine was really really good. I got the California Spa-melette. The menu said it was egg whites and I was all ready for it to be that yellow died sort of egg white, but much to my surprise it wasn't! It looked and tasted like egg white - which is my favourite part of the egg. The multigrain toast is seriously good, I don't know what it is but it's not like the usual stuff you get. Both the guac and the salsa were super spicy, just the way I like it. The fruit, however, had no flavour.  I think the omelette was over-priced but good. I'd definitely come back for a special occasion breakfast/brunch, but I'm not going to be a regular."}
{"text":"We went here for breakfast. but we didn't even make it that far. There were 5 of us, we stopped in for mid-day on a Sunday. We came from out of town and weren't familiar with Toronto, but this place looked nice enough - no line and a few open tables - so we went in.   The restaurant is decorated nicely enough, but the entrance was cramped. No big deal. We aren't the most conventional looking group, but we immediately felt like we didn't belong there. Whatever, we have money and we wanted a good breakfast, so we figured we give it a try.  However, we waited for a solid 5 minutes with no one greeting us despite open tables, so we figured it might be seat yourself. We approached the cash register where an employee was standing there not doing much of anything. \"Hey there, is it seat yourself?\" We got a snarky, attitude-filled \"Of course not. You need to wait until I tell you. Wait at the door.\" while we got looked up and down.   Uhh, ok. That was... not the best introduction. But we figured we'd stick it out. DEFINITELY not feeling like we belong now.  We waited a few more minutes (with no one coming in or leaving) while the employee still appeared to be doing not much of anything. Eventually he decided to acknowledge our existence; he grabbed menus, and came to the door. \"How many?\" \"5 of us.\" \"Ok\". He turned around and walked towards the back of the restaurant with menus in hand, so we figured we were being seated and followed him.   Wrong. So wrong. Half way to the back he stopped and turned around and gave us the most pretentious \"EXCUSE ME, what are you doing? I didn't tell you to come in yet\" and pointed at the door.   So we walked back to the door. And walked out. Good riddance."}
{"text":"Boom! Helped me re-discover the joy of breakfast. I am the type of person who almost always chooses a sandwich over eggs- I meet my friends for \"breakfast\" and I almost always buy \"lunch\". I used to always feel that buying breakfast foods when I'm at a restaurant is essentially wasting a meal out, much to the chagrin of my brekky-loving friends (who have confronted me about it).   Maybe it's a getting-older thing, but the allure of sleeping past the most important meal of the day is not quite the same as it used to be, and the idea of getting up early (yes, now sometimes I have to, but sometimes I even *choose* to) and meeting someone for eggs and toast and coffee so early in the day is strangely exciting. I even go there by myself sometimes. Seriously, it's like, crazy fun.  I don't do the poached thing, so the whole \"Benny Sent Me\" section of the menu is out, but I do favour the basic breakfast with free refills of coffee (tread carefully...), toast, eggs, bacon and that little piece of roasted tomato that just makes it perfect. A frills-less variation is- wait for it- $3.99(!?!) before 9 am, and there are also the more desserty dishes that involve chocolate and whipped cream and the like.   I love the atmosphere of this place, and its bright blue and yellow interior is as lovely as a clear and sunny morning.  The weekends always find them lined up outside the door, but I'd say it's worth the wait if your belly can handle it. Oh, and don't order the burger (I did once and was a little disappointed), you're here for breakfast, okay?"}
{"text":"Tik tik... fizzle! Sorry kids but this place is really nothing special. I ordered the Caprese Light which is an omelet stuffed with bocconcini, tomatoes and pesto... sounds good right? Wrong. It was a greasy gross mess. I spent more time digging my precious bocconcini out of a greasy war zone than eating anything else.   The coffee was weak,  the milk (which was sitting on the tables in the sun) was warm and I was missing a knife. Really the best part of my meal was the Boom fries which were actually tasty."}
{"text":"Um. I'd love to join the flock of people giving this Boom a favourable review, but I had no such experience there.   Positives: -We were offered beverages and snacks in line -The wait was below average for a Sunday brunch hour on a \"warm\" day -Cheap cheap cheap  Negatives -Our server was definitely on HIS period or something. A-tti-tude -Simple requests were ignored (water no ice please. um. no ice. please. um. if the next glass could have umm no ice, thks.... MUST I BEG?) -Our food arrived cold. frigid i should say.  -Our food also arrived well after the meal of the person seated half an hour after us  -Staff kept moving our tables around, plates-on-em-and-all, to accommodate new parties. We could barely get a conversation topic in without being shuffled around. Maybe it's ok to turn people away or have a longer wait time rather than playing musical tables all day? Just saying. -Our server disappeared after serving us and only returned to bring us more iced water. That's correct- iced.   There is no shortage of Brunch places in Toronto, esp. in the College St area, so I recommend trying another spot if you need a guarantee good time and waiters with decent hearing."}
{"text":"I love breakfast, I love Boom for breakfast, but I really don't go here often anymore for a couple reasons.   I'm going to have to agree with Alejandro when he says that there is CONSTANTLY a line-up. Especially on weekends. I stopped trying to go for weekend brunch here because when I wake up on Sunday morning, I'm hungry and I don't want to have to wait for an hour to get a seat. They try to be nice about you waiting in line, they'll give you menus so you can start deciding what you want, and they'll offer you snacks and drinks, but I just feel bad waiting in the already-cramped restaurant when all the servers are trying to serve people who are on both sides of you.  THEN, when you get seated, you have to deal with slow service, too. I'm not sure if they're under-staffed, or just too swamped, but I find slow service bothers me even more than waiting, so generally when I leave Boom, I'm not too happy, even if the food was delicious.  I'd say try this place once -- they have a really good breakfast menu, with healthy options (I remember the Spa-melette, with egg whites that you don't have to pay a fortune to substitute) and lots of delicious Eggs Benedict options for Eggs Benedict lovers like myself. But if you're impatient like me, choose a day when you've got time to spare and when there is less of a chance of a line-up -- weekdays."}
{"text":"was not very friendlly, food was good. Seems to.me that they only care about turning over the tables then service"}
{"text":"The food is decent for breakfast but expect basic food for a not so basic price. The coffee is bad and overpriced and I'm someone who appreciates their morning coffee and get upset when served bad coffee for 4$. The service hit or miss they were friendly at times, rude at others."}
{"text":"Meh is a pretty amazing word. It's almost describes itself in terms of its brevity and simplicity to pronounce. You can't accidentally say \"trichinosis\" but \"meh\" pretty much falls out of your mouth with not much effort, remarkability or circumstance.  I'd say almost the same thing about Boom except instead of 'meh' coming out of your mouth, it's going in. I thought the service was fair and the cock-laden decor was clean, bright and inoffensive (if not terribly corporate). But my traditional eggs Benedict was boooooring. Perhaps I have been spoilt by other options in the city (no perhaps about it, actually), but this isn't anything special. Not to mention that a basic breakfast starts around $7 and everything else goes up from there.   Unless someone talks me into coming back, I probably won't return on my own volition.  Obligatory Title Pun: BOOM goes the dynamite.  Menu Readability: Super corporate. Or should I say, Cora-porate? Zing.  Need to mention: At least they take debit and credit.  What this place teaches me about myself: I'm a breakfast snob and I don't care."}
{"text":"My friend and her dad go here religiously and since I am in love with big breakfasts- I needed to try it.   PROS: - Although it was busy, the service was extremely fast. Our waitress was sweet, attentive and fast. I wanted to amend my \"selection\" and she pointed me to something that was exactly what I wanted (i must have missed it on the menu)  - The options are great and the menu is easy to navigate which can be trick when there are a lot of items.  - The portion size was perfect for a big delicious breakfast  - The home fries were to DIE for, crispy, flavourful- I would eat them alone if I had too.  - Enjoyed the buttermilk pancake I had (was able to just order 1 which was a plus).. It was fluffy, tasty and cooked perfectly.  CONS: - Like many breakfast, their drinks should be larger. I mean, I need a big glass of chocolate milk if you're going to give me a meal that is the size of a small town.  - My scrammbled eggs were runny. Lucky for them I am not a big fan of eggs (just wanted to try them and it came with my meal) but they were running (I get turned off easily so I had to literally put them on the empty table next to me. The waitress quickly got me a new batch (which I barely ate as I was almost done my food anyway).  Over all, there was a line up but we didn"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I'd been here - couple years. My sisters and I popped in a week ago. SO fresh! It was delicious! I LOVE their smoothie options, including the CAPPUCCINO FRAPPE, hell-o! We've had their nearly everything on the menu at some point (my sisters aren't veg like me), except the sandwiches. Fast friendly service.  We don't live in this neighbourhood anymore but all agreed that the drive's worth it. WHAT a difference from the places we've tried so far around York Mills & Sheppard. I had the Farmer Gianni, my sisters had the Eggs Florentine and French Toast. All was great. The fruit is real and it's fresh!"}
{"text":"The service is good and it is definitely kid friendly! The food is very underwhelming and quite over priced for what it is though."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast.  They serve breakfast all day.  MY ORDER Threesome - two eggs, rye toast, pancake, sausage and fruit.  Mango, banana and peach smoothie.  I loved the eggs cooked exactly the way I like them, sunny side up.  Toast was thick and soft, perfect to dip in my egg yolks.  The sausage links were big, triple the size.  Pancake was thick and fluffy.   Fruits include honeydew, cantaloupe and orange, fresh.  My smoothie was fresh and creamy and just the right sweetness,  definitely ordering again!  The only qualm was the maple syrup was watered down.   SERVICE It was speedy and friendly.  PRICES Reasonable.  OVERALL A really nice Sunday brunch place."}
{"text":"Breakfast/Brunch was quick, tasty and reasonably priced. I had the NYC Lox, Eggs & Onions.   Waitress forgot that two of us asked for more hot water for our tea. We reminded her about 6mins later.   We didn't ask for the bill; weren't ask if we'd like anything else, we were just given it....cue to leave."}
{"text":"It was 2:45pm on a Wednesday and I was trudging homeward along college. I was hangry and my stomach was grumbling louder than the streetcar. I was entirely frustrated with myself for choosing tea and meetings over meals, and was eagerly plotting the big ass brinner I was going to prepare the moment I bust through my front door.   Then I saw it. Boom. People don't seem to love it, but it was open, serving all day breakfast and I was desperate, so I dove in and snuggled up in a giant booth to myself.   I got a traditional Eggs Benny with double fruit, no potato things and a tea. It was diner-y and not the world's greatest Hollandaise sauce, but man it hit the spot. It was exactly what you'd hope for when ordering Benny at a diner. A bit pricey, $15 + tip in total, but the other simpler breakfasts were definitely less dollars.   PEPPER POINTS for their free wifi. Who doesn't love having breakfast in the afternoon with full screen youtube puppy vids?"}
{"text":"I have made the mistake of coming to this restaurant more than once but I will never make the mistake of going a third time. With so many great breakfast places in the city including Emma's country kitchen just a block away you'd have to be a fool to waste your money and time eating at Boom, the service is horrible and the food is garbage with no flavour. My suggestion, enjoy the many awesome breakfast places that Toronto has to offer just don't make Boom one of them"}
{"text":"You can not beat this breakfast joint !! Great price point, food is very fresh, service is ok, could he better, but what im mostly interested in is the food, it really is a great place to have a good  breakfast with your friends. Highly recommend the good morning smoothie its a blast of fruits in your mouth."}
{"text":"Came back for the second time. And this time took the picture.  Very yummy sausages. Pricing is okay -$10.00"}
