{"text":"Scott our server was on point! Very attentive And courteous made regular rounds to check up on our table everyone got what they ordered deafly not my first time or the last time I will be enjoying a meal at the victory's caf√© here At the cannery casino"}
{"text":"We were seated right away and our waitress took our orders and we were eating in no time!  Great service and good food. What more could you ask for!  The manager on duty, Melissa, came by and checked on us several times to make sure everything was going as  it should be. I would definitely visit again"}
{"text":"My Family and I, we love to come to have Dinner every single time we come, we ordered something differently, and as always everything is just delicious, I recommend this place, for sure the prices are good and the stuff are very friendly, and you will enjoyed, either breakfast, lunch or dinner, everything is just yummy!"}
{"text":"I've been there three times for breakfast.  The over easy eggs I ordered have always been cooked perfectly.  The bacon is crispy but not burnt. The prices are very reasonable.  But best of all is the service.  The first and third visits I had the pleasure of May being my server.  She is very upbeat, pleasant, and efficient.  The second time I had Oscar who equally as good.  My only complaint is that they serve Pepsi products instead Coke.  But it certainly won't keep me from being a regular."}
{"text":"I always come to victorys during midnight and it never fails me. They have some of the best chicken fingers I've had out here in Vegas. Not to mention, their Oreo shake tops it all. Their service here is always great and friendly. I've never waited too long for my food and it always comes out hot and freshly prepared. Try this place out if you haven't already"}
{"text":"This is your average casino cafe food. It's not the greatest but it's still good. It's always nice that you are sitted quickly and they servers are nice. I had the chicken Caesar salad, chicken was really good but the dressing does have that fishy taste."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed; midnight dinning and we got the pot roast and meat loaf; pot roast was the lesser of the two evils; corn on the cob was over cooked BUT the mashed potatoes and gravy were good. The place has that homey kitchen feel but no love in the food"}
