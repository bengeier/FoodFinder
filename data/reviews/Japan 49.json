{"text":"Have tried to give this place the benefit of the doubt but keep getting disappointed. I can't understand how the service is so slow when during a weekday evening, and it's every time we come. Tonight we came in and my fiancé got the stir fry lo mein and it was ok, came out in a timely manner. I got the volcano roll....30 min in and $15 later the sushi falls apart. Seriously? For such expensive sushi it was not good. Save some money and go down the street to Masa, their sushi may not have fancy fish drawn on their plates but the service is far better and food is cheaper and better quality."}
{"text":"Outstanding food, great service, hibachi chefs a lot of fun! Definitely best Japanese  in charlotte"}
{"text":"''This was a really good experience. The meals were beautifully presented and tasted great. Service was excellent. We had vegetable tempura for an appetizer. Moments after being served another plate of broccoli was served compliments of the chief because he believed the first to not be as good as It should have been. The Hibachi flames roared high in the back ground so next time we'll do that"}
{"text":"Came here for a sushi dinner. I definitely will not be coming back. First, we did not receive the appetizer we ordered (it was left on the bill and we had to have them remove it). Second, the service was incredibly slow and it wasn't even that busy. We were there for an hour and a half. It took 40 minutes for our sushi to come out. And lastly, the sushi wasn't even that good. If you're looking for a sushi place, do not go here."}
{"text":"Sushi was fresh and very good... can do without the \"Birthday singing\" a little annoying ...  nice to have a good restaurant in steel creek area"}
{"text":"The worst food I have ever had. Absolutely disgusting. I live I LA and eat easy Chinese food all the time. This is unbelievably the worst food ever. All time; whole life."}
{"text":"I've been here 2 times already.  The first time was good enough for me to return.  The second time was disappointing.  The first time I sat in a booth and order sushi and a meal off the menu.  Eel and avocado is my favorite sushi, yummy!  I ordered the teriyaki steak and it was cooked perfect (medium well).  Last night we re-visited Japan 49 and took my parents.  We sat at the hibachi table and the wait was not long before the show began.  The food was prepared properly yet it lacked flavor.  As a person who does not salt their food, I salted my entire meal which added a quick note of flavor.  I would have preferred the flavor of onion, garlic, etc.  Our sushi was awesome again!  We were all disappointed that the \"shrimp\" sauce is very watery and the ginger sauce on the salad and for the meal was horrible.  I couldn't eat it.  :(   Lastly, our entire table (my family and another family) were quite surprised by the inexperience of our server.  He had the most blank face I've ever seen.  He took our order wice!  When he brought our bill back to the table he had the guests' pick out their bill/credit card from the pile he had in his hand."}
{"text":"This was an excellent experience! Every hibachi dish was delicious! Will definitely go back, the restrooms were spotless too by the way ;) oh, the servers / cooks were very entertaining."}
{"text":"The food was great, and they gave us a ton of food for the money! We had plenty for lunch the next day, we'll be going back soon for sure!"}
{"text":"Yuck. Everything was gross here, even the hot jasmine tea! How do you mess up just a simple cup of tea!? That's some unique talent -_- I let the tea steep for a looong time and there was still NO flavor - I sent it back assuming that perhaps it was old... so then we ordered soups as appetizers, those were both enjoyable- Miso & clear onion. We also added seaweed salad as an appetizer and that came out frozen in the middle! Also lacking it's usual flavor.. I realize seaweed salad is not prepared fresh at restaurants so it almost always should taste the same!  Ugh... and finally the most tragic of all was the chef speciality sushi rolls; Pink Lady & Super Crunchy - the chef prepared them with a very extravagant presentation including a lemon in the shape of a mouse. But they were gross! SO MUCH CREAM CHEESE inside the giant rolls, the rolls fall apart easily and nothing tastes very fresh. The flavor combinations are just off. I have honestly had better sushi at Harris Teeter. The restaurant employees are pleasant and thorough.. so they get 2 stars for decent service and 0 stars for flavor."}
{"text":"Very good food.  Good value.  Nice people.  We had Steak Shrimp combo.  Be prepared to eat a big meal."}
{"text":"We went and wanted to sit at a booth. After being seated, we waited for 10 minutes before I went up front and asked where our waitress was. The host came back and took our drink and appetizer order. After another 15 minutes our waitress brought our drinks....water. It was another 15 before one of the two appetizers we ordered came out and the waitress could care less.  Basically....service was awful and no one seemed to care. We just walked out."}
{"text":"Not worth my money at all. I ordered sushi Togo & it took 30 mins.. I ordered on a Sunday afternoon and there was absolutely no one there.. so idk why it took so long to make 2 sushi rolls. By the time the sushi came out , it was room temp..."}
{"text":"Very very good!   Andy the chief was amazing and hilarious.  Best hibachi place I've ever been to.  A very good amount for dinner and it was delicious.  I will go back and hopefully ask for chief Andy to cook for us!  Lots of sakie they give you.  Very reasonable price and you get a lot of food.  I got the chicken dinner and I am going to have leftovers for days.  Sushi delicious also!   Must go and check out for a new place!!"}
{"text":"I wish I can say nice things about this place but I can't. For one we arrived at 830 for a hibachi dinner waited aimlessly for our sever to bring us drinks and take our order didn't get a hibachi chef until 9:55. I really wish I was making this up. It wasn't even busy at all! We were the only ones there! What made me even more upset was the sushi I ordered. I ordered yellowtail jalapeño and got something way off. Confused I asked to see the menu again to make sure I ordered it correctly but no it was them who just mashed up tuna and yellowtail with thick pieces of jalapeño in rice. That's not what the menu said it would be. Once i addressed the server about the sushi he took it back and gave me the correct order... still it was not appealing nor tasteful. It was supposed THINLY SLICED yellowtail and jalapeño I got thick cuts of both. I couldn't stomach to finish it at all. I can't even think about going back here ever."}
{"text":"As a long time customer of Fuji, this is my new go to place. The staff are super friendly and helpful & the service is great. I enjoyed the atmosphere and appearance of the whole restaurant. I came on a Saturday night around 9 and they were able to take us. We had requested Joe as our chef, and after a little bit of waiting (which was worth it!), we had gotten started. Joe had cooked everything perfectly to our tastes and we would not have had it any better. He was very entertaining and very thorough. He had cleaned the grill impeccably, unlike the previous chef. Today was my uncle's birthday and he had received fried ice cream, which was a bonus! We had stayed late, but the staff was still friendly and welcoming. All in all, I would recommend this place to anybody that is looking for great food in a great atmosphere surrounded by friendly people. I will never be returning to Fuji, Japan 49 is now my favorite!"}
{"text":"We have lunch at this restaurant about once a month. They have great bento box lunches for just $10.00 and they are terrific. We like the terriyaki salmon. It comes with a delicious salad and miso soup. Everything tastes great and we always leave satisfied."}
{"text":"I ordered the shrimp tempura and rice, and this dish included a salad with shrimp sauce and clear soup. Good value for $16.95. I was given miso soup and salad with ginger sauce...wrong. But understandable, they just opened! But, I am curious if the owners/managers took advantage of the time before they opened to start and train staff early? The shrimp tempura was good! The rice...the rice was not so good! I chose to do the fried rice with my meal, but it wasn't normal fried rice, it was actually kind of an odd texture.   I plan to give them time to work out all the kinks and try again. It has potential! Excited to try the hibachi with friends and family."}
{"text":"A very ordinary tasting meal with a show and friends. The food and prep is very decent here, I am just a bit over Japanese Steakhouses but I kids love these place and really like Japan49.  I assume to go to a traditional Japanese restaurant. The owners and servers are very nice and friendly here. If you like Japanese steakhouses and hibachi then I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Today was my first visit to Japan 49, I ordered hibachi chicken, with a tuna roll And a spicy yellow tail roll on my lunch break. Let me just say, for the prices, this place is AMAZING! I even found myself calling back while I was at work to pay compliments to the chef. I would even go above an beyond saying their sushi is better than the sushi you get at red bowl, AND it's half the price. The staff was super nice, all around my experience there today really made my day after a rough start to a work day. Defiantly food for the soul. I will be making this a regular stop for lunches throughout my work weeks! Great job guys! You are phenomenal, way to make a first impression!"}
{"text":"Great Fun!! Great Food!! The chef was very talented and entertaining.  The restaurant is very nice and the wait staff was very attentive. I really enjoyed my visit and I will  definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Came in with a group of friends and sat at the hibachi table. Everyone seemed to enjoy their food and the playful chef who had a bit too much fun tossing food and squirting (yes squirting) one of our friends in the face. Besides that slightly off moment, it was all good. They made a custom sushi roll to order and presented it very nicely. The sake was warm and cozy... just the way I like it."}
{"text":"Been here twice this week, and the food is pretty tasty! Got the steak and chicken hibachi and it was cooked perfectly. Shrimp sauce is good too. The bar service could use some work though."}
{"text":"Just visited the hibachi table for my moms birthday dinner. YUM. We were pleasantly surprised, the food was delish.  We were seated right away, out server was very attentive. She made sure we had drinks pretty quickly and got our orders taken.  The show was fun as always. My food was cooked perfectly. I usually don't love the Miso soup but this one more flavorful and I loved it. Salad hit the spot, that ginger dressing was on point. I got the Filet, it was cooked medium and was super good! We all got the house noodles on our plate, what a nice treat. My kids devoured it... and shamefully so did I :)  My kids split a meal and that was plenty. They even split the soup up in two bowls so they didn't have to share. I thought was really nice and made for an easier dinner time for us.  We will be back, no doubt about it."}
{"text":"We went for dinner at 6:00 it was not busy at all. We had 2 small chicken with us and 4 adults. Dinner was delicious but our waitress came took our orders. Gave the wrong table our salad and soup. The chef came to cook our food told her we needed the salad and soup. She never came back to refill drinks or ask if we needed anything. After we ate found someone to get our refills and asked for to go boxes and our checks she came back to take our orders again! Yes again because she never rang in our meals and had no idea how to ring us up. After someone else came over 10 mins later to help her try to figure out our checks it's now 8:30 and the kids were ready to go. AWFUL wait staff! This woman not only had a massive language barrier she was no where to be found!  Maybe she should just be a greeter.   My suggestion- order to go"}
{"text":"I ordered off the YELP app and waited over an hour for pick up food on a Tuesday. It was not too busy at all. The lady at the front of the restaurant told me to \"order on the phone\" next time. Why have the option to order off the app then? Just a friendly warning to plan for wait time. Other than that the food was pretty decent."}
{"text":"The sushi here is great! We just moved to the area and I'm happy we have something so good and close. The prices are about average. The only reason I didn't give it a full 5 stars is because the service was slow. Will be returning!"}
{"text":"I've eaten sushi at Japan 49 a few times before.  They're okay rolls at decent price.  However, we were really disappointed with our order last night. Ordered $50 worth of sushi last night. Half the order wasn't good. The eel with avocado roll was just a big piece of avocado with eel sauce. Also ordered a $15 roll that was unidentifiable. It was disgusting! 4 rolls that fell apart as soon as you picked them up. The flavor was off. The sushi was covered in what i think was supposed to be shrimp tempura but was actually just mushy fried scraps. It was so nasty!! This is the last time I'm ordering from Japan 49."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place especially because of the many good Yelp reviews.  However, I was so disappointed with the service and food.  I dined by myself and arrived about 4:30 pm on a Saturday and business was slow.  At my request, I was seated at a table with a family of five instead of waiting for an indeterminate amount of time for more people to arrive to fill another table.  When the chef arrived at the table, I was grateful to get the meal moving because the wait seemed really long.  The chef was not coordinated, as he dropped cooking utensils on the cooktop when he tried to perform theatrics.  He was messy as he prepared and served the food.  His preparation of food was rushed and the food suffered because of this.  I had chicken teriyaki which was more salty than sweet, the vegetables were cooked with too much soy sauce, but the shrimp appetizer was the best thing I ate at Japan 49.  The server never cleared the empty plates stacked to my right, the bowl of broth I consumed and other trash remained on the table the entire meal.  I had to ask another server for assistance because the assigned server was not attentive.  I agree with another review about the restrooms needing attention, the restaurant needs to make a better effort to clean it properly and regularly.  Love eating grill side but will never return to Japan 49."}
{"text":"Attend dinner here last night around 6ish. Place was pretty empty. My nephews decided they want hibachi. Just the wanted to be entertain for a bit. We were greet by an American hostess. Wish I had her name. Her face and attitude is not the friendliest. If it wasn't for the kids. I would've left. We were seated at the far end in the corner of the room. After we placed our drink order which is lyceeitini and my cousin ordered a moscato. We were asked to move closer to the rest of the guests. I feel much better because I was like are we being punish. So far and in the corner away from everybody else.  Our waitress didn't speak very much English but she tried her best.. very accommodating. Our hibachi chef was entertaining. The nephews loves it. Food was flavorful.. The drinks however, ummm I'll leave those alone.. my lyceeitini tasted like vodka. And nothing much else to it.. garnish with a cherry NOT a lycee. I didn't finish it. My cousin didn't like her moscato either. I really did enjoyed their super crunchy roll. And I'm not a sushi person.  Now here's the part I'm not happy about and hope they changed, beside the hostess!  We ordered 2 rolls to go. It took over 35 mins to get it. So needless to say. There's only ONE sushi chef rolling all these order and the busy dinner hour about to hit. This restaurant has potential!"}
{"text":"The wait was long and there were about 6 families total in the restaurant. The food was just ok. The egg roll taste as if it was frozen from the box. So did the General Tso chicken.  Fried rice taste like brown rice with green onions in it. We will go back on more time to try the hibachi grill to see if that will be better"}
{"text":"Being from NY and a fan of sushi I have to say this place made me happy. The spicy crab salad could use a little more crab meat but it was tasty. I will be visiting again and hopefully for a sit down meal. This place is an hours drive from me but well worth the trip. I don't normally give \"100\" stars because there is always room for improvement but this place definitely earned 4."}
{"text":"Probably the strangest experience I've had in a sushi restaurant, TBH.  I went on a Saturday night with a friend and went straight to our table. It was definitely busy with a lot of people waiting. Hibachi looked very popular. The poor hostess seemed overworked, confused, and stressed running around trying to fill tables - perhaps a second host would have helped. We could hear a female staff member yelling at her a few times during our meal which wasn't pleasant. Our server wasn't the friendliest but I didn't mind. He wasn't familiar with one of the rolls we ordered, though, and thought we requested a regular roll without rice instead of the roll wrapped in cucumber. Good thing I corrected him. Our food overall was pretty good - not the best I've ever had, but definitely tasty. My miso soup was a disappointment, as it tasted more like egg drop and didn't have much in it. My friend ordered the salmon ball which was unusual (A mix of avocado, crabmeat, cucumber and fish roe wrapped in seared fresh salmon, topped with spicy mayonnaise and unagi sauce, sprinkled with crunchy tempura bits) but delicious.  Anyway, on to the weird parts: 1) Multiple times during our meal, excruciatingly loud, bass-heavy techno music came over the speakers yelling the following words: \"IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY, AND WE WANNA KNOW WHERE YOU AAAARREEEEE!\" followed by the staff coming out and clapping. This would've been okay if it only happened once or twice on a busy weekend night, but it happened five times during our meal. Five times. It was so loud that people were definitely getting annoyed by it. My friend and I, full disclosure, are emotionally and mentally approximately 8 years old so to us, the music was about on par with the hilariousness of a fart in public. Once is funny, twice is still funny, after that it's embarrassing. I went to the bathroom and could hear the music and it was as if I were in a night club.  2) Our sushi had an LED component to it. Not kidding. It was lit. I wish I'd saved my snapchat of it, because it was kind of hilariously tacky. Our Bonsai roll came with a pile of clear noodles with a small LED light underneath. It looked like a light up toy was accidentally placed on our plate.   I think the surreal weird details aside, I enjoyed the meal. I don't know that it was the best sushi I've ever had, but I'd probably go back and pretend it was someone's birthday for the music."}
{"text":"We just had dinner there and while the food was very good, and the chef entertaining, the service was lacking. We were there for around 45 minutes before a chef came to our table to prepare our food. With 2 small children in your party that can be an eternity. Our waitress never refilled, or offered to refill, my water the entire time. It also took a long time get the bill taken care of. Hopefully these are issues that will be resolved as the restaurant has been around for a while."}
{"text":"I took my 12 year old here who loves Japanese food but he did not approve.  The food seemed like it was microwaved.  It was cold and unappetizing.  Very disappointing.  Won't be returning anytime soon~"}
{"text":"Food was delicious! This was our second time here. Not sure about anyone's else's experience with the staff but everyone was super nice. It's super convenient and we love it"}
{"text":"Ordered two teriyaki steaks to go, hands down the best we've had in the area. Everything was packaged nicely and way more food than we imagined. Will be back again for sure!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in the area HANDS DOWN. Everything is super fresh and rice is always cooked to perfection. I wish I could give 5 stars but service is always slow, courteous but slow.  Worth it in my opinion!"}
{"text":"We came for lunch. Just like your typical sushi steakhouse. We didn't know who our server were. It was like ten servers waiting on us. As soon as one server took our order, another server ask the same the same thing. We order chicken stir fry. The food came out cold...to make things worst. There was a produce label left on the red pepper. We sent it back. When it came out for the second time, the food was still cold. It seems like they just moved it around. My boyfriend was pretty upset to find the same damn produce label on red pepper tuck away. Won't be going back"}
{"text":"As a lover of hibachi, I would say this place was very traditional but definitely leaned more on the better side for sure. We went on a Thursday night as a part of the Yelp Restaurant week and the 30% discount was definitely a selling point to give it a try. It is actually in my neighborhood and this was my first time visiting.  I got the crab rangoons as an appetizer, pretty tasty! I then got the hibachi chicken and shrimp dinner (with salad and soup customarily) the shrimp were a great size compared to other restaurants of this same sort. Food had very good flavor and portions were not skimpy at all. The chef entertained us and the children in another party well with sake shots and flying pieces of zucchini. Definitely a comedy watching people trying to catch them in their mouths!   Overall, I would return as I live only five minutes away, but I would've loved to see more people in the restaurant, so perhaps the word will get out in the neighborhood to give it a try."}
{"text":"Went there and the rice was not done. Vegetables was nasty and not season at all.   Chicken was not done.. Salmon had to be recook.  As the customer  I was not asked if I want hibachi or teriyaki.  The cook just took it upon his self to cook my food in teriyaki. I had no ideal because I went to the bathroom before he began to prepared the food.  I caught him putting it on my salmon.. I notify the manager and he claim that I should have told to waitresses.. That's a lie because at Nakatos where I eat all the time the cook ask before preparing the food.. Well the 4 dollars this manager took off the bill I will use it for the Steele Creek ER allergic reaction.  Never again will I ate there again.. Note if you have an allergic to anything tell them.."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic and portions plenty. Shrimp was super yummy and large. Best broth soup I have ever had! They are obviously going through some growing pains of being a new restaurant. There was a bit of the wait at the table until our chef came, he didn't have everyone's order planned out correctly, and my brother never got his chicken. PS don't sit near the front door, you get a draft of cold air when the door opens every single time."}
{"text":"This place is top notch! Exactly what we needed around here!! Yay!! I hope they keep the momentum up."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The food is always good. The sushi tastes super fresh. The service is exceptional. They have a sake shot while your food is made, ton of fun. Today was the best experience at the end of dinner they brought my daughter a balloon animal!!! I highly reccomend"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a fun Hibachi experience, yummy sushi or Asian options - this is an awesome place! We tried all of the above! The food was all so good - and such nice portions! We took a lot home with us. That said, we did find room for chocolate cake!!!!  We will be back soon!!!!"}
{"text":"This place has the absolute worst service ever. 20+ mins for someone to even come to the table. Clueless owner walked by is 20 times before realizing there was nothing on our table. Would.never come back. As I write this the food still hasn't arrived. We'll see how long it takes."}
{"text":"We had hibachi and a few sushi rolls. The sushi rolls were AMAZING. Hibachi was pretty good, nothing over the top though. We had filet mignon and chicken hibachi. The wait for the hibachi griller was pretty long. We had our soup, salad, and sushi rolls all gone and eaten long before he came to make the hibachi. All in all the pretty good place. Would definitely return for the sushi if anything."}
{"text":"Got pick up on their first day open, and can tell this place is going to give other Chinese restaurants some heavy competition. Got General Tso's chicken which had huge pieces of chicken that was a lot of chicken lightly breaded instead of all breading. The rice was also amazing.   We also ordered the Pink Lady Sushi roll which looks good if you like Sushi.   The service was very fast and got the order exactly the way I asked for it."}
{"text":"Greeting at the door was less than friendly. The girl at the door informed us since we were late (5 min) that we would have to wait for a table.  They seated us within 10-15 min. The waiter was efficie t in the beginning but he was MIA for the rest of the meal. Lots of dirty dishes sitting on the table and had to ask for refills. The chef was entertaining and the food was good but not great. The lobster was tough and the chicken was over cooked. Overall the food was tasty enough but the service was very hit or miss."}
{"text":"Tried this place out on Saturday. Had the hibachi steak and loved it. Comes with soup, salad, fried rice, veggies, steak , 2 pieces of shrimp and noodles.  Though the price was $19 for all of it, it was a good portion of food for it. Everything tasted good. I was happy with it. Will definitely be coming by and try out more of their menu."}
{"text":"I stopped in on Saturday (6/16/18) for lunch with my son. We had eaten here for lunch during the week a few months earlier.  We ordered the Godzilla Roll, Japan 49 Roll, Summer Roll, and Sweet Potato Roll (no raw fish in any of these dishes). The Japan 49 Roll that my son ordered tasted \"off.\" I tried it and agreed. We each only ate one piece of the Japan 49 Roll. My son did not try the cucumer-wrapped Summer Roll or the sweet potato roll.  I started feeling ill within a few hours. I have been ill and unable to eat anything but jello since that sushi -- it's Wednesday now, so I have ruled out a simple stomach virus.   I hope the owners see this review and esure that their sushi is always safe."}
{"text":"This place recently opened. Nothing special to write home about. Still looks like Phatz Cafe on the inside. Food is mediocre and not very busy. Waitstaff is ok at best. The only exceptional thing about this restaurant is the bathrooms. A little pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"2nd time here. The first time my boyfriend and I dined in. It was okay. I ordered the salmon hibachi. My salmon was cooked way too long but the rice and veggies were good. We got a good bit of food for a good price. Our waitress failed to refill our drinks but over all it was an okay dinning experience. The 2nd time at this location was terrible. I ordered to go the lady told me that my order would be ready in 15-20 minuets. Arriving at the 20 min mark I walk in to the restaurant and wait at the entry booth. 3 minuets later no one came to greet me. So I decided to walk to the bar. The bartender made eye contact with me THREE times and didn't bother to ask me if I needed anything. I let another minute pass and I asked him where do I go to pick up my Togo order. He pointed at the entry booth where I had just came from. Agitated I walked back to the booth and no one was there. A few more minutes passed and finally someone asked me if I needed help. Told I had a Togo order she asked me if I had paid yet and said I had to pay before my order was brought out. Needless to say their food is good but the customer service SUCKS."}
{"text":"This was my 2nd trip here. I should have known it was too good. I went in as soon as they opened on my 1st visit on a Saturday. Service was great as there was only 2 tables; food was hot and taste great. 2nd visit was when I brought my family to visit during the holidays. What an embarrassment! Our server Gin must be related/family member of the owner. Service was horrible! When we FINALLY got our food, it was cold. She didn't come back for a while. We took our food home and tried to salvage it, but the smell of ir once we arrived at the house was horrific! NEVER, NEVER, NEVER will we return. No need in trying that again!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here on our way through based upon the reviews. We were not disappointed. We got a friendly greeting upon arrival and quick seating. I ordered my usual hibachi steak and shrimp. It was delicious!"}
{"text":"I love hibachi restaurants and I will be returning to this one! I only found out about it because it was a part of Yelp's Restaurant Week.  I received 30% off my bill for checking into Yelp.  I went on a Monday and there were about five people dining in the restaurant. I wonder if they will stay open. It looks like they do a lot of take out orders.   I really enjoyed the food. It was pretty standard hibachi to be honest.  Crab rangoons were tasty and not very expensive. For our entree, we ordered the Japan 49 for two on the hibachi grill.  It came with chicken, filet, lobster and shrimp, salad, soup, noodles, rice, and vegetables. It's served with ginger and shrimp sauce. I think they are both delicious but really LOVE the shrimp sauce. Shrimp sauce on everything for this girl!   The reason I give this restaurant 4 stars instead of five is because the service was terrible.  The waitress never came back to our table to refill our drinks or bring us more shrimp sauce.  It took a long time to get out check and a take out box.   As far as the food goes, the chicken was nothing special and the lobster was overcooked. It was super chewy and rubbery.  The steak and shrimp were delicious as well as all of the sides. I enjoy dipping the grilled veggies in the ginger sauce.  The ginger salad dressing was amazing on the salad.  It's always a personal favorite of mine.  It's worth checking out. Great prices and good food. Hopefully the bad service was just a one time thing."}
{"text":"Where's the beef? I do like this place. Love the Mongolian Beef, it's my go to. Have gotten the take out now twice. Loaded with onion, light on the beef. At $14, that's a tough one to swallow. May need to find another dish. I do not have this problem in the restaurant."}
{"text":"I cannot get enough of this place.  I eat here at least 3 times per month I love the lunch menu tons of choices!"}
{"text":"Mushy sushi. Everything bathed in avocado (ingredient not mentioned in roll description although I did add that I'm allergic to it) only one edible roll out the three and it was room temperature, mushy, and disgusting. Surprised it was so bad with the good reviews."}
{"text":"Went with a few friends to Japan 49 for a casual dinner.  The meal and the chef was great! The chef had high energy and the wait staff was great on filling up our drinks too.  They only had two chefs the night we went so we had to wait a while before getting our food but they brought us drinks to make up for time.  Good experience.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Very good food and a nice attentive staff. I had the miso soup and the Tuna Tataki and it was great. Can't wait to come back and try the hibachi some evening."}
{"text":"Food is amazing!  Very fair price and great service.  From their sushi to their udon they're all great. Been here various of times and always very satisfying."}
{"text":"Have gone there a couple times. The cooks are good and entertaining. Food is consistent and good. Good value for money in my opinion. My main gripe is cleanliness of Bathroom. With a small child I don't really like having them strolling up to a puddle of urine at the kids urinal. Will return in future though. Better than fujis now in my opinion."}
{"text":"Service was slow but the food was ok. We ordered Hibachi but didn't sit at the hibachi table. The rice tasted bland but the steak was good."}
{"text":"Surprised to find this great restaurant! Delicious udon noodles n habachi dishes. While u eat there, u can enjoy the cook dealing with food. Actually, it is an interesting cook show. Love the nice cook n service there! U cannot miss it!"}
{"text":"While the portions are decent sized for the price, the biggest problem here at Japan 49 is flavor and quality.  I've sat at the hibachi table and I've ordered sushi but I was not overly impressed with either.  It's unfortunate to have another disappointing restaurant in the Steele Creek area.  On our first visit, we sat at the hibachi table.  I ordered the red snapper and my partner ordered the steak.  The shrimp appetizer and both of the proteins were cooked well, as were the vegetables.  Unfortunately, everything was under-seasoned and a little bland.  Our chef did not seem overly enthusiastic, but it was a decent show.    On the other visits, I always ordered sushi.  The first time I ordered sushi, it was good.  The fish tasted fresh and the sushi rice was decently seasoned.  Based on that time, I tried to order sushi a couple of other times.  On both of these occasions, the sushi tasted strange.  I'm not sure if the fish was not as fresh or what, but some of the sushi pieces were basically inedible.  I normally love tuna and salmon, but the last two times these pieces of fish had a weird taste.  And when someone is eating raw fish, that is the last thing you really want.  When we dined in, our waitress was friendly and the service was good.  However, I've noticed a few issues with getting carry-out.  Each time I've ordered, the food has not been ready in the promised time.  This is quite frustrating when you show up after the promised time to account for this and still have to wait 10-15 minutes for your food.  Overall, I think Japan 49 has too many negatives for me to keep giving them my business."}
{"text":"We wanted sushi and our local spot was closed. Decided to try Japan 49 and wow!!  The rolls are delicious. We also tried the fried octopus dumpling and it was amazing! We were seated at the sushi bar and the sushi chef was very personal and nice.  We found our new sushi spot."}
{"text":"Our first visit and we are pleased. We had table dining as opposed to tepenyaki or the sushi bar.  He had two spring rolls and the beef and broccoli entree while I opted for chicken lettuce wraps. Both were delicious and the servers were very attentive.  Good came out quick and hot.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"It was ok. Nothing special. The coupons have to many restrictions on them. Jasmine's is much better and more choices."}
{"text":"The portion sizes are HUGE. The chicken hibachi is literally like 3 meals and the sushi pieces are double the normal size (which makes them a little challenging to pick up with chopsticks, but that's ok because they're delish).  The Fallen Angel roll and the Super Crunchy roll were great and the miso soup was tasty. Give this place a shot! (Saturday at 9:30 pm)"}
{"text":"I went here to have dinner with a friend on weeknight. She wanted hibachi and I was craving sushi. We were seated immediately at a hibachi station that already had patrons waiting. They were finished with their soup/salad and the waiter took our orders. The hibachi cook did not come until my friend was finished with her soup / salad so there was a lot of time spent waiting.   I ordered the crab rangoon ($5) and the cheap price makes sense. It is not worth the money! It's more breading than anything else.  The French Dragon Roll was really good! It's a shrimp tempura roll topped with eel and avocado. I'd come back for that roll and it was decently priced. ($12)  My friend liked her hibachi, but the wait time was kind of ridiculous, especially since it was a slow Wednesday night."}
{"text":"Didn't know Steele Creek had such a great hibachi restaurant! Chef was great and kept us entertained and the food was great. Would definitely recommend and will be back! Surprised with how good it was, that it was pretty dead for a Friday night."}
{"text":"Good food but would not honor one of their digital coupons presented to them. Won't go back."}
{"text":"Our chef made my daughter's day after a long two days of testing. She was blown away with the show he put on while cooking our food to order. Very funny and kept us laughing. Trust me, they give plenty of food. You will be beyond satisfied!"}
{"text":"Food wasn't nearly as good as the previous reviews. I've never seen a Japanese hibachi restaurant put so much garlic in food.  and the service was nonexistent. For the price of the food the quality really isn't worth the money."}
{"text":"I went here on a date, hoping it would be good. The miso soup was salty, the house salad was drown in ginger sauce, and the sushi was a little warm. I mean they do a good job presenting their items, but  it really needs some major changes."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite hibachi restaurant! We have been twice once for hibachi and the other time for sushi.   We went for hibachi right after they opened and the experience was the usual fun show with the additional of a chef who was surprisingly heavy handed with the free sake to mouth pours! One of the unique things about their menu that is different from other hibachi places in the area is that they offer a couple's special. For the man and I that is perfect since we always end up sharing anyway!   We went back for lunch for sushi recently. It was difficult to surpass the hibachi and go for the normal sit down section (for me anyway) but the lunch menu was great. Even though I had been craving sushi seeing what a great deal the bento box was I had to switch. For $10 I was able to get soup, salad, teriyaki salmon, California roll, gyoza and fried rice. There was so much food it looks like a run on sentence writing it all down on Yelp! The boyfriend got the sashimi lunch special and I have never seen such a beautiful plate. Beautiful pieces of fish with a large variety.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"THE BEST HIBACHI IN CHARLOTTE! So freaking happy right now... ordered take out after seeing the amazing reviews and JAPAN 49 did not disappoint!  Considering Steele creek has the nastiest of restaurants -- none of which have ever brought me back even for a second attempt for edible food--  THIS PLACE IS A GOLD MINE!   Hibachi filet and hibachi veggies are beyond perfection! Cooked exactly how everything should be! Perfectly delicate, buttery, filet-- fresh perfectly cooked veggies...   I'm almost in tears. I was set on moving out of Steele creek back to Ballantyne due to lack of food options here... maybe Steele creek isn't all too horrible now   THANK YOU JAPAN 49   You have just gained the most loyal of foodies in the area! See ya 2-3 times weekly !!"}
{"text":"Glad I tried Japan 49, but won't be back on my own gumption. I had the 2-roll lunch. Came with salad or miso soup. I opted for salad with the classic ginger dressing you see at Japanese restaurants. However, I'm not exaggerating, the salad had so much dressing slopped on top that I couldn't even see the lettuce.  The rolls I ordered were spicy yellowtail and yellowtail jalapeño. The latter was very good - until I got a 1.5\" bone in one of the last pieces. The spicy yellowtail was good, but not great. The yellowtail pieces were small, and mixed into some sort of spicy mash as opposed to pieces of fish with spicy sauce on them.  My lunchmate ordered the tuna tower app. This was chunks of tuna and chunks of avocado, with a thick spicy sauce covering the chunks. Topped with sesame seeds and smelt roe. This was tasty, but it was 1/3 tuna and 2/3 avocado so seemed imbalanced.  He also ordered Pad Thai. I didn't taste it, but he commented it was dry. He kept adding soy sauce over and over. I will have to say it was a huge portion.  The service was solid and attentive.  Lastly, the restaurant is docked a full star in my review because the ladies' room stall I used was unacceptable. The toilet had not been cleaned, the seat was up which just gave a better view of the uncleanliness, the trash bin in the stall full, and it was out of toilet paper to boot, which of course I learned too late. For a Monday - i.e., the beginning of the week - I found this to be very disconcerting. What condition would the stall be in a few days?? Plus the faucet I used had a broken handle so the water kept shutting off when I was rinsing my hands."}
{"text":"Japan 49 is new and it is exhilarating!! WoW!! What presentation.... what flavors, simply delicious!! I recommend this place to everyone in the Charlotte, NC area!!"}
{"text":"Seriously the best sushi I've found in Charlotte. It's our go to place for sushi and they NEVER disappoint! Come probably once a week. The rolls are huge with LOTS of meat inside. Tons of variety and different taste. They also have the traditional Japanese cooktops for hibachi, never had it, but it always smells delicious! Love the combo of the sushi and the hibachi in here. Always fast to bring the food out too!"}
{"text":"Great place to have Hibachi grilled food! We bought the meal for two and thought that for the amount of food and the price is very reasonable. Not a huge display of tricks by The Hibachi chef but that was okay with us because the food was great!"}
{"text":"So far I've still been really happy with the food and portions but there have been a few issues with orders getting mixed up or things getting left off our plates which they did correct but it took talking to 3 different servers to finally get worked out. Seems like they still have some issues communicating between the front of house and kitchen during busy hours."}
{"text":"Loved it! I've been waiting for this place to open and wasn't disappointed. The service was impeccable, presentation was great and the sushi was delicious! The Pink Dragon roll was awesome, must try. I'm a sushi snob and give this place 5 stars. So glad they opened in our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I'm not gonna lie and say it was the best hibachi I ever ate, but it was pretty good. Got hibachi steak and shrimp, came with a soup, salad, bowl of rice, serving of noodles and vegetables. It was a ton of food. Reasonably priced at 20$ came with a show. Shrimp was best, followed by noodles, then steak, then vegetables and finally rice. Nothing stood out as amazing and I think 4 stars is a fair number. A good place to go for hibachi."}
{"text":"Great place! Best hibachi i've had in a long time. We got the special meal for two and it was so yummy- filet, lobster, shrimp, and chicken"}
{"text":"My best friend and I went during Yelp Restaurant Week, so after checking in through the Yelp app, we received 30% off of our bill.   We went on a Monday night at 6:30.  Slow night at the restaurant.  Including the two of us, there were a total of 5 adults, a toddler and a baby as customers at this restaurant for probably the first 30 minutes that we were there.  We were all seated at the same hibachi table.    They took our drink orders quickly and brought the soup (which was delicious and flavorful) and the salad.  I ordered my salad with ranch dressing but the dressing was pretty watery.    We ordered Crab Rangoons.  They were very dainty/delicate looking, almost cute.  Crispy to the bite but very light.  Great tasting!    As our entree, we ordered the Japan 49 for two on the Hibachi grill which came with Lobster, Shrimp, Filet and Chicken and the fixins as we say in the South.  ( You know the Hibachi drill - rice, noodles, grilled veggies. ) I have to say that the noodles were so good! I've never had noodles that thick and wonderful before.  Good rice, although it got hard towards the end of my meal. The Lobster was really tough and perhaps overcooked on the grill?! The Shrimp size were medium sized and were very good.  Filet was cooked medium and just how I like it.  Chicken was well chicken, nothing to write home about.    They provide 2 BIG dishes for sauces (shrimp sauce and ginger).  When I go back, I'll just pass on the ginger sauce but double up on the shrimp sauce... YUM-YUM!!   Unfortunately, the service left a lot to be desired.  My drink was never refilled and I didn't have anyone to ask for more shrimp sauce. Our waitress was no where to be found when we were ready to pay. In fact, the other family at our hibachi table had to go to the front hostess stand to ask for her because they were ready to go too.   Even after they went to the hostess stand to ask for her, it took her a couple of minutes for her to come out from the back.  I normally wouldn't even mention this during restaurant week but keep in mind, the restaurant wasn't busy and we were her only table.    The portions were plentiful.  I think / hope that service may have had an off night."}
{"text":"Tasty food, pleasant staff. However, it would be good to have better communication and language skills with the Chef.  Unfortunately , He did not understand some of the food allergy requests.  We  enjoyed sharing the hibachi table with pleasant company. Nice to meet new people and enjoy the environment.  I will return."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Friendly and hardworking staff. Sushi chef was on point and it came out fast. Traditional hibachi fare didn't disappoint. The owners/managers were there and helping out. I think this would be a killer date night spot, special occasion spot, after church spot, or just a chill Saturday afternoon spot for you to try out. We will be back."}
{"text":"First time here for dinner.  Delicious and entertaining.  Steak and scallops were flavorful and large portions.  Ginger dressing was delicious and salad was crisp and fresh."}
{"text":"Horrible; my drink look like shit. My noodles were dry. Chicken looked like it came out of a Tyson bag"}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely delicious! Even the plating of the food is beautiful. Massive kids plates, delicious sushi, and wonderful staff will definitely keep us coming back. Hands down my new favorite Japanese restaurant. My first experience here has been hands down wonderful and we will be back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite hibachi place in Charlotte now. I had never had the noodles that came with the hibachi chicken and they were soooo good.   The rice is so nice and has a really quality feel to it. You can tell the chicken is fresh and the soups and salads don't taste as if they've been sitting.   The white sauce is absolutely perfect. Not too runny. Not too thick."}
{"text":"Awesome menu. I love that you can get Chinese favorites or hibachi. Sushi is great also. Pricy but well worth the splurge."}
{"text":"Disgusting- order dan dan noodle. Supposed to be beef with brown sauce. The brown sauce is grease from the ground beef. NEVER AGAIN!!!!  Went for lunch takeout on a Friday. Ordered the beef pad Thai. You get a choice of one side. I chose crab Rangoon, they give you 3 little ones they were really crispy and delicious tho. The pad Thai came in a big portion, enough for two. They forgot the peanuts. It had a good flavor, the beef was tender and it was supposed to have sliced red onions. I literally found one slice of yellow onion. So, I'll be checking my food before I leave. I'll go again and try something else. Bottom line, what I got was good."}
{"text":"My new favorite Hibachi/Sushi place. Atmosphere is nice, clean and inviting. Great for big parties. Our server was Lynn and she was amazing. Extremely attentive! Love the menu, it is full of choices, so if you go with someone who doesn't like sushi or doesn't like hibachi, there are plenty of other options. I had the Godzilla roll (spicy tuna w/ salmon on top),  it was a pretty big roll and well worth the price. Fish is extremely fresh (unlike MAI)! Dumpling and Fried rice were also good! GREAT EXPERIENCE!! I HOPE THEY KEEP IT UP! I'LL BE BACK (Arnold Schwarzenegger voice)"}
{"text":"Our family loves hibachi style Japanese steakhouses. We were so excited that a new one had come to town. We decided to give it a shot (party of 12) Allow me to preface my review that I wish I could have rated a 2.5, however, not functionality within the Yelp app. I also wish I could rate the food and the service separately.   I'll start with the food. The food deserves a 5 star rating. It was fresh, seasoned just right, and just down right awesome. My wife and I had the Japan 49 special for two with lobster, shrimp, chicken, and filet mignon. Very tasty and cooked perfectly. I also ordered the Fallen Angel Roll. Again, very tasty. I definitely recommend. Others at the table ordered, hibachi chicken, hibachi salmon, teriyaki chicken, and beef fried rice. All remained extremely positive about the quality and taste of the food... now to the service...  I completely understand that accommodating a party of 12 is not easy, however, I called and made a reservation. We arrived 5 minutes before and was promptly seated. After 15 minutes a waiter came to our table greeted us and took our drink orders. They arrived after another 10 minutes or so. At that time we provided our choices from the menu. The waiter was extremely rushed and appeared to have 3 or 4 hibachi stations that he was waiting on. The hibachi chef promptly came to our table to begin the show and prepare our meal. It was just like any other place in the Charlotte area. While cooking the food the chef knocks over my water (it missed me as I was quick to act) but all over the table and food. Ok ok... I understand... accidents happen... but... there was no \"I'm sorry\" or any type of apology. He didn't even try to get someone the help clean the table up. Just kept on cooking. We finally flagged down another waitress and she came with a couple napkins. Frustrated, I walked to tables around the restaurant and grabbed the rolled silverware so we could clean the water up.   The chef had completed our meal and we were grubbing. Remember how good I told you the food was? The waiter went missing after initially taking our order. Drinks were empty, plates were piling up, and I was getting restless. My wife walked and spoke to the hostess and she said someone would be with us shortly. 10 minutes passed and still no one. Now mad, I walked to the bar area and spoke to the bartender (very friendly gentleman) and he immediately came and refilled drinks. Another 10-15 minutes passed and still no sign of our waiter... we were ready for our check and end the longest dinner experience ever! I walked over to the kitchen door and just waited for him to come around the corner... I found him in the abyss and we finally received the check...   My apologies for the long review, however, wanted to share the full experience as at times people just leave negative reviews with very little qualification.   I still think we will return to the restaurant. Did I say how awesome the food was? 5 stars for food quality 0 for customer service."}
{"text":"Just tried this place with my mom recently. The food was delicious and the waitress was friendly.  My only complaints are that it was very expensive and no fortune cookies.  I'd be willing to give them another chance."}
{"text":"We love Hibachi and we're very impressed by Japan 49. Both the food and service was great. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Very good! Good food and pretty good service.  The sushi and other Japanese food is the best in the area.  The restaurant is clean and the prices are also good and very reasonable.  Love it"}
{"text":"Really great Hibachi place- very kind staff, host seated us immediately, waitress took our drink order- they are still so new they don't have a wine list yet or draft beer, just basic wine & select bottled beer (had local craft and domestics thou), bar tender came around and offered free sample of Korean Saki (it's yummy!), chef was funny and great. Food was overflowing and delicious- I had Filet Mignon and he cooked it perfect to my temp request. We will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good actually. Pleasant surprise...sushi, hibachi, etc. However The place was vacant on a Sunday afternoon. The location isn't great..sticky floors which was a little gross. And they really need to do some work on the landscaping or just cut grass, trim the bushes... something. It was just sloppy and sad over all. Then the bill, a bit too pricy for what we got."}
{"text":"I walked right to the bar late 8:45pm? On a Monday night. Took a couple minutes to realize I was there waiting but then it was flawless. Seaweed salad, spicy tuna roll and a no rice bonsai roll with Monday half price bottle of cab...so glad I didn't settle for something different. Care taken in prep of bonsai roll. Service was great, it was late so not crowded, but even so, they were very pleasant. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Don't bother making a reservation for 4 people at 7:15 on a Saturday night, you still won't be seated until 8. Tell me why they couldn't take a 7p reservation?  Food is great and that's why we will return."}
{"text":"Contemporary atmosphere and great service! He was friendly, made suggestions and the food came quickly. Albeit we were after the lunch rush but the rolls were amazing!! We will definitely be coming back for more sushi, sashimi and to try the hibachi."}
{"text":"Great service and very good food. Love the hibachi and sushi rolls are good.  Fun chefs a good place to hang out with some friends."}
{"text":"Excellent. I have been twice, once for lunch and once as part of a group dinner where we took up 4 stoves.  As to the lunch, service was fast.  The chicken pad thai was excellent as was the sushi rolls.  As to the hibachi corporate event, they put 21 people where there was really room for 18 at both pairs of grills.  42 people total.  The BIG negative... they only had 2 chefs so one pair of tables ate first before the second pair even had their cooking started.  But...  lucky for my group, we were served first!  The chefs were excellent.... very entertaining and the food was ample and delicious.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and most of the experience was meh. No one was at the front when we arrived so we waited a few minutes until the hostess appeared. She was on the phone with a pickup order you could tell but seemed pretty short with them and as she is getting there order she is trying to cash customers out. I ended up going to the bathroom and when I came out my friend was seated. The server was prompted and greeted us with waters. I started with the salmon Avocado Ball and my friend ordered the lettuce wraps. The menu is very vague and doesn't really tell you wants in the dishes. I did not enjoy the Salmon Avocados Ball at all, nothing was good about it. Too much crunchy flasks and spicy mayo made it worst. My friends shrimp lettuce wraps weren't good either, too much celery with over powered the flavor. Then he went for the fried octopus balls which were way too chewy but had a good flavor. And I got the lunch salmon and scallops hibachi which was really good and the reason they get a 2 review. Upon leaving you go back to the hostess to checkout and again she wasn't there and came back on the phone. But at this point there's 3 pick up customers waiting and she still seems bothered by the customers on the phone. It seems as if they do get pretty busy so I would just suggest that the hostess not handle both the phones and the customers in the restaurant because she wasn't very pleasant as she was doing a lot."}
{"text":"My first review of 2017!  So, I'll start by saying that I'm not a big hibachi person.  Nevertheless, some friends invited us out for NYE and this was their pick.  I'm all about trying new places, and I always keep an open mind.  They raved about this place, so off to hibachi it was to ring in the new year.  It's safe to say, I was fairly impressed.  Located right off of Tryon, in the Steele Creek area, this restaurant recently opened in what was once a Fatz Cafe.  The interior has been updated with a sushi bar, and 6 large hibachi style tables.  There are still booths along the perimeter that may or may not be original to Fatz.  There was a full bar area with a large flat screen TV, and another flat screen above the sushi bar in the main dining area.  Upon entering, there was an odd moment where the manager and the hostess couldn't agree over where to seat us.  We were momentarily left in limbo, but they finally shifted us from one table to the next where we sat to start our meal.  We were a group of 7, and the hibachi style tables had us sitting, for the most part, all along one side.  This made conversation amongst us friends, that hadn't caught up in a while, difficult.  Not any fault of the restaurants, but I quickly realized that hibachi is definitely not the type of place to go when you want to have a decent dinner conversation with others.  The menu offers a full selection of sushi.  We saw a large sushi boat float to a neighboring table that looked pretty amazing.  We also saw several large platters that were very well decorated.  One couple in our party ordered a roll, and I, being the only other member of the group that eats sushi, was offered a bite.  It was pretty on point.  The hibachi menu offers every protein option, and combination that you could imagine.  The food was prepared with far less grease/butter than most hibachi places, making it far less heavy.  The portions were perfect and the prices were not off the charts.  My wife and I shared the two person special that came with filet, lobster, chicken, and shrimp.  All entrees come with soup, salad, rice and veggies.    Everything was well prepared with the typical hibachi style showmanship.  The chef even shot sake directly into your mouth if you were so inclined.  Having never been before, our 9 year old daughter (the 7th wheel in our group) really enjoyed the show.  And yes, they offer a kid's menu.  The table was offered samples of a Vietnamese \"wine\" that tasted like banana with a little bit of carbonation.  It was pretty good and the ladies of the group ordered a couple of bottles.  It was served from what looked like a half liter sized soda bottle.  Overall this place had the full package.  If you're into hibachi, I'd definitely recommend Japan 49."}
{"text":"I tried the volcano roll. This was very good and filling. I ordered an additional smaller roll thinking I wouldn't be full, yet I was. My co workers got hibachi (from the kitchen, not the grill) and they all liked it. Clean atmosphere and fast service."}
{"text":"Definitely would recommend. We sat at the hibachi table by ourselves on a slow night, but the service was great, very attentive, and the chef still put on the whole show for us. Maybe they're trying to make up for that previous review?  The Godzilla Roll we shared as an appetizer was fantastic and I'm looking forward to trying more sushi options! The noodles that came with our hibachi dinners (shrimp/filet) weren't exactly what I was expecting; a little soggy with what I think was an oyster/fish sauce? I'm interested to try some of their non-hibachi food options in addition to the sushi."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Fuji in the Rivergate area, but I have to say, Japan 49 food is better. Their Hibachi steak is really really good. I've been here at least 3 times and they are consistently good. The Sushi is good. The egg roll good. I've been able to get in quickly, service has been friendly. A great new addition to the Rivergate area."}
{"text":"We just got back from this place. Excellent all around. Like others have mentioned, the portions are BIG. I can't imagine anyone leaving hungry. I had the General Tso's with shrimp. Just delicious. The service was excellent."}
{"text":"Had a great experience at Japan 49!  My wife and I stopped by on the way back from the airport and we're so happy we did. We live in Columbia SC, but will definitely be back as frequently as possible.   Jason, the sushi master, was incredible. He was very friendly and created a special appetizer based off or favorite fish right when we were seated at his sushi bar. He was kind, professional, and took great pride in his work!  The manager, KC, was also kind and made sure we had everything we needed for a great evening."}
