{"text":"I'll start by saying that if you find yourself trying to come up with negative things to say, get a better hobby.

This place is amazing, a different vibe than a lot of the other places I've been to in Old Town.  The food is fantastic (really, best tacos and happy hour menu in Old Town), the beer selection is amazing, plus they have their own brews, and the staff is nothing short of phenomenal, and it starts from the top and trickles down.  Jean is fantastic, and her bar manager Matt makes it his personal mission to ensure the service is top notch and you enjoy each aspect of your visit.  The bartenders and bar backs (Joe, Jennifer, Stephanie, Marcus, just to name a few...) have awesome energy and are some of the friendliest people, making it that much more enjoyable to come here.  I'd love to comment on the waitstaff, but truth be told, I can't.  But let's be honest, they've got to be top notch as well.

Whether you're looking to catch the game on a weeknight, start your weekend off right, experience the best taco tuesday around, or even just grab a quick bite and a drink, you'd be silly to not at least give this place a shot.  All it took was once and now I'm pretty sure you could call me a regular."}
{"text":"I would not return to this restaurant. Starting from the moment we walked in, we were greeted with disorganization and indifference for customer service. After we placed our name on the wait list and waited 45 min, we checked in with the hostess to see where we were on the list. The response was \"oh I forgot about you and we've had open tables, you'll be next\". We then asked a group of men to join them at a community table and we were told they needed the open seats across the table from them so they could see the game. Another 30 min passes and I ask the hostess again and she forgot a second time! When I asked for the manager, she said she was the manager!! Needless to say, she wasn't. The real manager came out and offered to buy us a round of drinks. We finally joined the end of a community table and we're served plates with old gum stuck to them! The only good thing about this experience was a server named Ashley who went above and beyond to find us a table, and continued to check on us to make sure we had a nice meal! The manager never came back to check on us and didn't seem to care about how the rest of our experience was. Finally, 1 out of our 4 meals was forgotten. So everyone's food got cold while we waited for our last dish to be made. The manager,Cole came out only when requested and didn't seem phased at all."}
{"text":"Went on Sunday to watch football, lots of televisions to watch games.  We had a great turnout of Ravens fans.  Good company, good good, good friendly staff makes for an awesome Sunday.  Desert Nation Army!!!"}
{"text":"The good: Large open patio, cool understated decor, and friendly servers. My Moscow mule was expertly crafted and one of the better ones that I've had in the Valley area, my bf and friend also seemed to enjoy their beer flights as well.

The bad: the food was subpar. Between the three of us, we ordered the pork belly tacos, the filet mignon truffle tacos, beef short rib tacos, fish tacos, carnitas tacos, and an order of the truffle fries. The pork belly tacos consisted mostly of tough pork meat with only a little delicious pork belly. The beef short rib taco was dry and lacking flavor, the fish taco appeared to be filled with frozen fish sticks and a bone was found in one. The filet mignon truffle tacos and carnitas were all right, but nothing worth ordering again especially  since we live in one of the best states to find great tacos. The truffle fries were shared between the two guys, and they didn't seem to eat many of them, so I'd guess those weren't winners either. 

Conclusion: I wouldn't say that I wouldn't return here, I would return to grab drinks with friend to either watch a game or pre game before going out in old town, but I wouldn't plan on eating a meal here again."}
{"text":"Absolutely no complaints.  Nice atmosphere, good service, and good location.  Had the quesadillas and a few beers - very pleased. Will be back"}
{"text":"Holy Moly the seafood burrito is in the running for being one of the best food items I've ever tasted. I'm trying to take my time eating it Bc I want the taste to last forever. Nom nom nommm"}
{"text":"Love this location, right in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale. Patio has outdoor tvs, drinks are flowing and they let doggies on the patio. Went yesterday and heading back again tonight!!"}
{"text":"Meh. Great reviews, and we were local looking for a yummy meal. This was just typical food with less than exciting atmosphere for a Thursday night in Scottsdale. Plenty of better nearby options."}
{"text":"Bad first impression of this place.  They just opened in Old Town Scottsdale, and I was excited to try it for the first time today, as I recently moved in to a new apartment complex just down the street.  My roommate and I went over this morning with my 2 dogs, and wanted to sit on the patio and have drinks and lunch.  The hostess first said that they did allow dogs on the patio, but it turns out they only allow them in a small isolated corner of a patio that is on the other side of the building from everything else.  They have a huge covered patio, but the only area they allow dogs is directly in the sun, and it looked very un-inviting.   Keep in mind that the temps today were approaching 100°, and they actually were going to put us and the dogs in the direct sun for lunch.  We said thanks, but no thanks, and left to go to Boondocks instead, which has a fantastic dog friendly patio.  I've lived in the neighborhood since November, and almost all of the bars/restaurants in Old Town allow dogs anywhere on the patios.  Social Tap has made a bad business decision on this issue in my opinion.  In a neighborhood that is booming with new residential units, they should be more accommodating to people with and their pets. Very disappointing :("}
{"text":"Great beer.  Great patio furniture.  Friendly staff.  I found my new after work spot."}
{"text":"Was looking for some place to eat last night in Scottsdale, and turns out it was their opening night.  Excellent atmosphere, great patio, staff were friendly and easy going (surprising given how busy it was).  Food was excellent, I'll need to come back to try a few other options!"}
{"text":"Big fan of the Social Tap in San Diego, so I was excited to hear about the new location in Scottsdale. Amazing food and a friendly staff.  Huge fan on of the Ahi Poke. Highly recommend it.  Seared Ahi Tacos are also a must. If you're looking for a laid back place to come watch your favorite team and have a drink (or three) this is the place.!"}
{"text":"Wife heard an interview on the radio (Beth and Friends Show) from a Social Tap employee mentioning free meals for dads on Fathers Day. We decided to try a new place out of the many, many choices in Scottsdale and Arcadia. When we arrived, I asked about the \"Social Hour\" menu since it was after 4pm on Sunday. Waitress said that, \" We don't have that meanie that this location\" despite it having Scottsdale listed on the menu. Not an acceptable answer

We ordered and ate good food. Got the bill and my meal was still listed. Asked her to take it off and she said, \"it was only for brunch.\"  

Do not appreciate dishonest businesses even if the food is good. I will tell everyone about my bad experience."}
{"text":"Great spot to go with friends for amazing cocktails and delicious food. I can't get enough of the Brown Butter Whiskey Sour and the Seared Ahi Tacos! Yum!"}
{"text":"Terrible service that is very unorganized. Servers can't manage a table over 10 people. Food took over two hours and only half the order came out. Had to remind the servers of the missing orders."}
{"text":"Great potential with the location and building structure, however, something's just not clicking.  Asked the server if there were any drink specials and she said \"no\".  Looked through the brunch menu and there were several drink specials: bloody marys, $15 bottles of champagne, etc. Ordered the Chicken and Waffles which are quite good but the menu states \"chicken thigh meat\" and I have now gotten white meat twice. The first time I asked about the white meat substitution, they said they ran out, used white meat instead and that nobody had noticed before.  Went there today and got white meat again. Asked the server to check with the manager and he said they always use thigh meat, when I'm staring at a plate of breast meat and she acknowledged that it was white meat, as well.  Manager would never come over.  Maybe they just don't want to change the menu and simply practice avoidance. Again, it was good but really do love thigh meat if I can get it."}
{"text":"I remember this place being named something else before it became Social Tap, so I could tell I haven't been out to Scottsdale for day drinking in a long time. The place is definitely done up and appreciated all of the tvs to watch preseason football. Food was great, but the service was slow. We definitely had a sizable group but I would've appreciated it more if our server would've swung by when the drinks got low."}
{"text":"This place was AWESOME!! Great ambiance and food was delicious!! I'll definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Fantastic decor & energy. Great selection of drinks & food options. Try the spicy tortilla app!"}
{"text":"Shrimp tacos, Halibut fish and chips, and the Ahi Tuna are absolutely delicious!!! Very reasonably priced for a Scottsdale restaurant...  The restaurant being cozy with an large outdoor patio created a very upscale vibe! Far from a typical sports bar..."}
{"text":"Service was fantastic. Can't beat the patio atmosphere and the close location to everything. Can't beat the burgers and the bowls. The beer on tap is all local beers."}
{"text":"I don't like writing reviews on this app filled with self-important wannabe food critiques, but I will make an exception. This place is very, very good in all aspects."}
{"text":"I live in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale and there are many, many bars and restaurants to choose from.  On my second visit here, it was important for me to watch the Giants game. I requested one of the many TVs be tuned into it. I was told it would be but I had to pester the staff to make it happen. It was changed eventually but only briefly as another patron requested a different game and they changed mine in the bottom of the 9th of a tie ball game.  Silly people, I can watch the game at home, but I prefer to watch and support local businesses. I won't return here, there are too many other options."}
{"text":"First time here for lunch. Perfect. I had the Southwest Burger and my friends had the \"Make your own salad\" option.....all excellent. I will come back again. Very friendly staff, and owner, although very busy, made it a point to come over and ask how everything was. Great place."}
{"text":"There are many elements of Social Tap that earn the 5 stars! Beautiful space, delicious food, and most importantly- fantastic employees. The bar itself has a cool atmosphere. The food was delicious and well-priced. My boyfriend and I had tacos, burritos, and dessert over our two visits (two nights in a row!). I had the filet mignon truffle tacos because of a recommendation from the manager. Amazing call! They were incredible! The manager (I didn't catch his name) and the bartender (Sarah) really made our visits worthwhile. They were both fantastic- friendly, genuinely nice, and very attentive! They were the reason we came back a second time (and will be back every time we're in the area). Our visits to Social Tap were definitely a highlight to our stay in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Food was good but alcohol definitely watered down. We tried multiple drinks. I'd be careful"}
{"text":"Brutal, and I mean brutal \"service\".  Don't bother. Food was relatively good but no way to enjoy it with such poor wait staff."}
{"text":"Social Tap is a great pace for football! Our server, Taylor, was amazing! Wait until Taylor has a table available because she is the bomb diggity! Her customer service is great and she treats everyone with so much respect. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Last night was my first time trying this place. I arrived a little after 8 p.m. on a Saturday and to my surprise the crowd was small 

All of the staff were very friendly and prompt! The atmosphere was really nice. Outdoor patio with heated lamps to keep you warm if your standing outside, nice decor in the inside, and plenty of TV's. Great place to relax with some friends.

I order two fried fish tacos & 1 grilled shrimp tacos ($12). I definitely will try this again. The young man said they get their fish flown in fresh..

I tried 3 separate drinks.. the first one I had to send back - ugh, the other two were okay, I maybe drank half of each one. All three where \"girly fruit drinks\".

Final verdict: I will come back to this place for the atmosphere and food. I'll go ahead and pass on the alcohol drinks and maybe just get a lemonade or something to go with my food.

The drinks were a bust, but the tacos and staff saved the night. Four stars overall.."}
{"text":"Food, drinks and service were all on point, especially for only being open a short time! Great local beer selection! I got a flight so I could try several and found my new favorites! I started with the wings...best I've ever had! I'm a short rib connoisseur so I had to try theirs with Parmesan grits...to die for! Melted in my mouth! Too full for dessert but they looked amazing so I'll save up next time. Finished the night off sitting at the indoor/outdoor patio bar...best seat in the house! Definitely my new spot!"}
{"text":"Definitely a great addition to old town!  Food is awesome!  Filet mignon truffle tacos....BOMB!!"}
{"text":"Nice semi-sports bar.  Atmosphere is upscale, I would have gone for more TV's versus fancy decorations.  The highlight of this place is that the food is very good.  Service is spotty...but with new minimum wage laws bigger sections are the new norm."}
{"text":"Went to Social Tap last night to celebrate my husbands birthday. The bar/restaurant is beautiful, amazing attentive servers and great food! I would highly recommend stopping in for a drink and dinner!"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in town. I went almost every weekend in the month of June alone! Great atmosphere, awesome service, amazing food!!!"}
{"text":"I'm sadly underwhelmed by this place. I come here every weekend for the USC alumni games and despite our great games I always leave unsatisfied with the venue choice. The staff is great, but it seems like the management is not good at anticipating the staffing need. 

Last game was during a fight so it was packed and I was ready for subpar service, but an hour and a half to get a drink is completely unacceptable. I ended up getting a free drink, but when you order 3 over the course of the night and 4 come because of a miscommunication between the waitresses that drink should be free.

Their menu is comprehensive and their wine list is great so I was really excited to eat here originally and I haven't been disappointed by the food. Last week I had a Chenin Blanc which was great, but today I ordered a zin that came out cold. Not on the cool side, it was colder than my water (which never get refilled no matter how many times I ask for it to...). The wine was also bitter so I asked if the bottle was just opened, they said it wasn't so that means it has been open for too long and it was probably in the fridge to keep it drinkable longer. It didn't work, guys... I also just swallowed some cork while writing this review. Unfortunately I swallowed it all so there isn't any point in getting a fresh glass especially since the glass is finally approaching room temp.

Bottom line: food is great, service has potential because the staff is great just management doesn't plan appropriately for events, and the drinks are hit or miss. I'll be here every weekend because I have too much team spirit not to be, but I'm just going to be prepared to be disappointed by the venue and hope that my team makes it up to me by keeping our winning streak going so it doesn't ruin my day completely. I wouldn't be a patron if it weren't for the alum events."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere and incredible wait staff! I go and sit at the bar alone at times to grab a beer or eat. Love it"}
{"text":"I don't find many places that I frequent where I love their food but their cocktails are just...meh until Social Tap.

In this week, I've visited twice and the food has been A+..for lunch I had the grilled tacos and they were delicious. I visited for happy hour and had the buffalo chicken sliders and again A+. My colleagues had the ahi tuna sliders, loaded potatoes and tacos and all plates were clean when the server came back by. 

Across the table, we had a \"Cadillac\" Social Rita, Coco Fresa and Pinot Noir. For each of us, we only had one drink - that's really hard for a group of gals meeting for happy hour on a Friday after a long week of work! 

Overall, everything I've tried food wise is great...but cocktails need to be stepped up!"}
{"text":"Came back after years. This used to to be a favorite dive spot, Mickeys Hangover. Can't say that anything will ever replace my favorite dive but the food was phenomenal, great vibe, had tons of tvs for games, great service. Filet tacos and calamari are a must! I will be back again :)"}
{"text":"He had:  BLT, no drink
She had:  Filet Mignon Tacos, Grand Canyon Moscow Mule.

This is a sports bar so it's noisy and there are a lot of TVs and a lot of people watching those TVs.  That's fine it's a sports bar!  In fact, if your looking for a place to catch a game this is a great place!  The atmosphere is cool, they have corn hole, blocks and other bar games, and the patio is big and nice.  They have a good variety of drinks and local beer on tap.  Plus the service wasn't lacking, they staff was very nice and attentive. 

Now, the reason for 3 stars... the food just wasn't good unfortunately.  The BLT was just okay, I mean you can make one just as good or better at home, nothing special.  The filet mignon tacos were extremely bland.  We don't think they were seasoned at all.  

Bottom line, for a place to have drinks and hang out Social Tap is a great spot!  If your wanting to eat your better off heading somewhere else first and then getting a drink here after."}
{"text":"This bar I only I let my drunk ass kids take me to. Strawberry Margaritas are perfect."}
{"text":"This was one of the stops on a Pedal pub that we did in part of Old Town Scottsdale.  The service was horrible.  Our group stood at one side of the bar and were never ackowledged or anyone even nodded at that someone is going to be over to help us. The entire side of the bar (which was on the outside of the building) was empty and multiple times bartenders looked over and saw us standing there.  We ended up leaving and going across the street to Wasted Grain. We had great service and bartenders that noticed us. If this place was busy I could maybe see it, but it wasn't."}
{"text":"To all my New York Giants fans out there.  This is our new bar.  I am very excited!  Great TVs!  I also love there wings and Chicken Tacos!"}
{"text":"Been meaning to go in social Tap for awhile now and it totally did not disappoint!!! Food and service was amazing!  Great job on the place, it is beautiful."}
{"text":"This place has great ambiance, tasty food, and good drinks.  The thing I love about it the most was the service.  Every single person we encountered was friendly and super attentive.  Normally, whenever I go to Old Town, I experience crappy service and the cold shoulder.  Not here! I will definitely come back :)"}
{"text":"Had a bad experience here last night. Friends and I decided to try this place out. Service was horrible. Waitress blamed it on factors that she couldn't control but that's not a good enough excuse for my experience. Waited over 20 minutes for 1st round of drinks. Waitress spilled a bit of my drink on me and never came back with napkins. Asked for water for the table and only got 2 waters? Waited about 45 minutes for just nachos and tacos. Food was mediocre and not brought out by her but other staff members and I was pretty upset she never came with napkins after I asked and would be common sense if you spill a drink on a customer; this greatly affected my mood. After she dropped the check for $72 and some change, we told her $30 cash first then rest on the card. My card bill came back to $49 and change. Waitress basically stole a seven dollar tip and it wasn't worth the wait to fix it since she had previously taken forever to get back to our table. Dishonest staff and average food. I would urge this establishment to look up our bill and find out who this waitress was. She never even introduced herself by name."}
{"text":"The food was average, the atmosphere was really loud and you had to shout so others could hear you. Our waiter, Andre, was great and knowledgeable but the other staff were really inexperienced and kept trying to give people's food to whatever table they wanted. They had a good selection of draft beers. My food was over cooked but that's better than undercooked, hence the 2 stars. The truffle fries were good though."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, lots of TVs, plenty of selection of different beers and an excellent menu. The service is 2nd to none, friendly and fast bartenders and wait staff. Another bar in Scottsdale with a great, dog friendly patio. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Social Tap in Scottsdale for a brunch recently. Wow, was it good! She had what she said was \"the best breakfast burrito I  ever had!\" This was after living in foodie town Austin, Texas for over a decade, where breakfast burritos are as common as cowboys.  She allowed me a bite or two, and the flavors were outstanding. 

I had a sweet tooth that morning, so I chose their amazing French toast. It was griddled Texas toast with cinnamon vanilla batter, topped with a perfect blueberry compote surrounded by powdered sugar. I had a side order of extra crispy bacon to balance the sweetness just a bit. This was one of the best plates of French toast I've ever had! 

Taylor was our alert, friendly, and efficient server. She made our visit such a pleasure. When we finished we walked from the cool patio inside and met the savvy manager, Cole. We asked him to relay our high compliments to the chef. 

Fortunately, we live near Social Tap and will be going back soon. I'm going to get the breakfast burrito next time. Social Tap is relatively new to our neighborhood, and it's a great addition to the Old Town Scottsdale area. 

Check it out!"}
{"text":"My bf lives in Old Town Scottsdale and we are always looking for new places to try in the area. We had driven by Social Tap a few times but hadn't gotten the chance to try it. 

Last night we went in and overall we were impressed! The atmosphere is fun and lively. Even on a Wednesday night people were out on the patio drinking and playing bean bags. 

We ordered the Trifecta Wings, in sweet chili and Jamaican jerk, as an appetizer. The sweet chili is better, but overall the wings were good! Then we ordered a bunch of tacos. The Filet Mignon truffle tacos and the carnitas tacos are the best. I would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing people, amazing drinks. One of my by far favorite places to be in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I was excited about this place because it's a reasonably priced sports bar which Scottsdale is sorely lacking. However, the food seriously sucked. I got a Cobb salad with grilled chicken. The chicken was meh, really bland. The lettuce was wet and therefore couldn't hold any of the dressing. Even the bacon lacked flavor. My boyfriend got the carnitas tacos. Honestly the worst taco I've ever tried. It was sopping wet and dripped all over the plate when you tried to eat it. It was a huge hunk of this colorless meat that was absolutely flavorless. 

I hate returning food and I often don't. If I don't like something I usually eat what I can and then never come back. This time, both dishes were so inedible that the waitress noticed we weren't eating and brought the manager over. He was really nice and asked for our feedback since it's a new place. He offered us gift cards to come back and try them again, but then let us know that for whatever reason, he couldn't activate the cards. No big deal. We probably wouldn't have been back anyway."}
{"text":"Best place in Scottsdale to watch any game or UFC fight because they have tons of TVs. Drinks were good and reasonably priced. Kale salad is a must! The bartenders and severs I came across were all friendly and welcoming!"}
{"text":"With so, so many places to eat in Scottsdale, that have great food, are professional, clean, and very service oriented, don't waste your time or money at Social Tap. This place is Terrible. A friend and I went for lunch today. There were a couple tables filled on the patio and four people at the bar, so not very busy.  We were seated at a booth in the bar area. It took 10 minutes for a server to come over.  The bartender stood behind the bar and acknowledged us a couple times but would not come by to help us. Our server dropped off water and we told her we were ready to order.  She said she would come back, but never did. Both of our water glasses she gave us had large chunks of food on them, blatantly obvious, and they were still served to us. It was disgusting. After waiting five more minutes we walked out. Our server watched us get up and leave and did not say anything as she was chatting by the hostess stand. I am really happy with our decision to not order food, based on what we saw, I would not trust the food in there.  Do yourself a favor and choose another restaurant, you will be so happy you did!!"}
{"text":"I work in hospitality and understand the basics & essentials of running a restaurant/bar. At a place like this i just expect the basics. This was the WORST experience I have ever had at a Sunday Sports Bar.. The bartenders don't say hello don't say thank you and literally snapped their fingers at the guy next to me to get his credit card . The manager is almost as bad, no clue how do handle anything. Sammie the bartender is an embarrasment and it's a joke that she ever gets a tip. 



I never YELP but this ruined my Sunday football so much I had to let the public know."}
{"text":"Best UFC bar I've found in the valley, and definitely the classiest. Gorgeous marble bar, tons of crystal clear screens to watch the fights. Good beer selection, and some good food. Absolutely loved my nachos, completely satisfying. Also loved my grilled shrimp taco. The grilled fish taco was fine, but forgettable. The tacos came with chips and salsa and the salsa was very flavorful, nice and smoky. 

My wife got the beef manchego melt, which was the weakest dish. I had a bite. Even with the au jus dip it was dry, and too salty. 

Staff was professional and hardworking. I'll be back."}
{"text":"SKIP THIS PLACE!!  We went in on Black Friday to watch some football and grab lunch.  After politely asking the bartender twice to change the channel to a specific game, we waited 20 MINUTES and it still wasn't done.  He claimed he was too busy!  Huh.....to pick up the wand and hit a button????  Our server literally was MIA as she was trying to serve the ENTIRE patio. We couldn't get another round of drinks and couldn't order food.......she was way too busy.  That's right, it's Black Friday with everyone off of work, and they staff one bartender and one server!  Almost incomprehensible!!  We asked to speak to the manager, and guess what.....the manager is also the bartender!  He was rude and short, with absolutely no idea of what customer service should be. We closed out (which took another 15 minutes) and took our business elsewhere. Will never set foot in this place again. There's too many other great places in Old Town.  DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND PASS ON THIS ONE!!"}
{"text":"Poor service we had to walk out. Not sure how the food is or how other waitresses are but we will definitely not be back."}
{"text":"This bar has turned into a Giants and Ravens bar, but we just popped in to try some tacos on a random weeknight. The veggie tacos were really good, albeit at $4.50 per taco. No taco without meat should ever be more than three bucks. That being said, these tacos had lots of brown rice, grilled onions and peppers and other veggie stuffed inside a single corn tortilla (at least double-wrap it for the price). They serve the tacos with some good chips and mild salsa. The short rib tacos are still solid, but are no longer offered on the taco Tuesday spread. Will check out the football menu at some point this season."}
{"text":"The food wasn't that good.  We sat at the bar and the guy bartender wasn't very helpful.  It took a few minutes for him to get our drink order and then we had to ask to order.  When our food came out, I needed salt and pepper and more dressing.  My husband wanted hot sauce.  The bartender never came over to ask how our meal was or offer to refill our empty beers.  We finally had to ask a bartender that was clocking in to help get us beers.  By then we had eaten our food without getting the extra condiments we needed."}
{"text":"I don't not know what happens to servers when they sit at the bar waiting for drinks to show up and never even look at the fact that people have sat down and are waiting for service. This is what happened to us when we came there on a Friday afternoon. We watched as four of the servers collected themselves over at the corner of the bar. We can see them and I'm sure they seen us. When One of the servers came from outside I asked her if we can get service at our table. She told me she would get somebody to help us out. Five minutes later another server came by and dropped off the menus and told us she would get our server for us. After waiting another 15 minutes we decided to just leave. We got no water and the menus that were sticky."}
{"text":"This bar is awesome. Great prices amazing food wonderful staff. Highly recommended, we drive from north east Mesa to come here."}
{"text":"The place seem to be a happening place to watch the SB, management told us after the fact that each member of our party is being charged $75 per person...and the TVs went out."}
{"text":"Good place with great indoor/outdoor set up. However way to HOT to have the doors/windows open during the summer heat. I won't be back until October."}
{"text":"I'm new to area, california transplant. I was looking for a local sports bar to watch my local teams. After a great first experience, second time was disappointing. It was not busy at all, severs did not stop by my bar stool. They did attend every one else around me and were super chatty with them. They also stood around chatting with themselves while I was trying to get service. I am am an older Asian male, maybe the cool frat boy/girl is their clientele of choice. Sorry guys, you have the SF giants flag hanging outside you front, you dont know SF people clearly."}
{"text":"This place was just ok. I'd read a few reviews before visiting this spot and still decided to give it a try. Cool atmosphere, a great place to watch games. The staff was nice, but the drinks and food were lack luster. I ordered a Tito's and cranberry and it was full of juice, very little Tito's. Initially I wanted wings but decided to go with tacos, big mistake. The tacos were unappetizing, I've had better tacos from food trucks. In all, I doubt if I'll return."}
{"text":"Came in for brunch on a Sunday and the food was awesome.  Had the chilaquiles and one of their signature drinks \"Scottsdale Sunrise\".  Both were great.  The owner Steve came out and chatted with us for a few minutes which was unexpected and he seemed to be a great guy.  Sat at the bar which was clean and had great service.  Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"I look to Yelp frequently to check out the places I'm heading to, but never do I take the time to write a review once being home. After such a great time this past weekend celebrating the holiday with my friends and family, I decided this place deserves a shout out!

I was so pleased right from the start! The host was cheerful and accommodating and I couldn't wait to get a seat under the cool misters they have. Our server came over quick with a smile on her face and made sure to tell us her name, Taylor, and assured us we were in good hands for our drunken Cinco De Mayo fiesta. She knew everything without question, so to say we were impressed would be an understatement. 

We got there just after Brunch had ended (coming back earlier next weekend for sure!!!) so we had to take a little more time to explore their large lunch & dinner menu with lots of different options! I decided on the seared ahi tacos, which our waitress talked us into since I was having a hard time deciding, and they were SO GOOD! I love that you get chips and salsa to munch on as well. My friends got burgers that looked amazing, and they were huge too. We also shared the wings and brussels & bacon app, holy cow those brussel sprouts are delicious. 

When I walked inside the restaurant from the patio, I couldn't believe how much bigger it was inside. I'm not into sports much, but this place makes me want to be since their TV's are so great. The bartenders were all busting out drinks and working hard to help two party bikes that just rode in, seems like a lot of work to get people in an out like that, but they did so with smiles!

Overall, I had a great experience this weekend. Just sitting and watching the restaurant work had me feeling really good (the drinks helped too haha). I will be seeing you again this weekend Social Tap, keep running a great spot!

P.S. their building an upstairs roof deck, how cool is that?!? Cant wait to see it"}
{"text":"Sadly the past 3-4 times we have gone the service has been horrible. So bad we've had to leave twice after sitting down for 15 minutes and nobody acknowledging us  at all.  Went last weekend for brunch. They weren't even busy Everyone kept looking at us and making eye contact but nobody said a word. Even when we got up to leave they just watched us walk away. 

Not sure if there's new management or what has happened but I'm sad because the brunch is so good.  Too many places around to choose from to have to deal with lousy service."}
{"text":"This place is perfect for any sports fan but especially for SF Giants fans like myself. The service was great for how packed it was and the food was delicious!! Our server was on top of everything and we had a large party of 10. The drinks were great and the cookie desert was amazing!!"}
{"text":"1st time here after WM PGA Golf tourney. I was impressed. Good food, drinks, and service was great at 4 top in bar area. I will be back."}
{"text":"We've been to Social Tap three times so far and each time has been great. The appetizers, especially the nachos, are very large and satisfiying. I have also had their tacos, burritos/burrito bowls. All the food has been wonderful and flavorful. Although I haven't been a fan of the beers they produce (seem to be very basic), they have a great selection of other beers. It has never been crazy busy when I've gone, but I've only gone for lunch or happy hour (what they call \"social hour\"). Would recommend trying this place out!"}
{"text":"Thank you Taylor for recommending Orange blossom and California Creamin beer! Great combo great service thank you!"}
{"text":"Food and service was subpar at best, beer was cold though, very cold, lots of tvs so that was cool. Very over priced!"}
{"text":"Not sure who's posting the positive reviews, Friends, family, current employees?   My two visits to the bar area with my girlfriend were filled with a combination of indifference and stupidity from the wait staff.  There are too many great to good options in old town to waste time here.  Check back in a 6 months and it will likely have a new name and owners."}
{"text":"Fantastic food had the calamari starter, then steak dinner, steak was done just right medium rare. Ended with ice cream desert great!! Will return to try other yummy items on the menu. Their selection of beers is impressive. Great place to unwind, enjoy a beer or two and have some good food."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and patio. Drinks were good. Food was awful. I felt bad for the server, she was so apologetic and took one of the dishes off our bill because my husband could not eat at all. I left her a 50% just because she handled the situation so well. 

Ahi poke - tuna looked brown and did not taste fresh. 
Teriyaki bowl - was absolutely disgusting. Chicken tasted like dental filling. Weird medicine flavor. We sent that one back. 
Cobb salad - kinda hard to mess up, but they forgot to bring the dressing. No big deal. 

Never going back. We like to eat good food when we are out having drinks."}
{"text":"Social Tap may be my new favorite Scottsdale bar.  The food is diverse and delicious and reasonably priced.  The wait staff is always friendly and their is both plenty of room inside and on the large outdoor patio (high tech misting systems!) and plenty of TVs if you are watching a game.
Whether going with a few friends or large group (the owner accommodated about 50 of my fellow Ravens fans recently) it's a great place to have fun!"}
{"text":"This place has a great out door atmosphere. Great place for happy hour, not too crowded and the music isn't too loud so you can have a conversation. The drinks were cool and refreshing. I didn't have any bar bites. The service was good and they were quick in getting us our bill when we were ready to leave."}
{"text":"Food and drinks are great. The servers are so nice, ask for Andre! Definitely recommend coming here"}
{"text":"Great service and atmosphere! People were so nice at the host area. Brought our dog a bowl of water with ice and let us sit on the patio. Got a great group of people right from the get go at the door! Food was awesome!!! Will be back for sure. :)"}
{"text":"We came from Flagstaff and were more than pleased when we got that same awesome waitress we had last time. Taylor is amazing she remembered what we liked and was able to suggest the perfect beers for our friends!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Great food and great atmosphere!!  Great beer selection and a huge patio!! Definitely one of my favorites!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and both times were less than impressive.  The two times I went were at lunch and both times it wasn't busy.  The service was super slow on both occasions, and on my most recent trip, the server was super unfriendly and made it seem as though we were a burden for her.  Mediocre food and overall not a great experience.  Probably a great place to grab a drink but I wouldn't recommend going for a meal."}
{"text":"We stopped in last month to enjoy a drink and really enjoyed this new bar!  We sat at the bar and I enjoyed a cider.  Nice atmosphere, extensive drink list and good service too!"}
{"text":"What a great place! My coworkers met here to talk. They had a mister to cool us off. 

Happy Hour specials and big screens tvs!"}
{"text":"You know it's an intense love affair when you can't keep me away. I stinkin adore this place so much I spent my entire weekend crushing hard on it. It was a lovefest that still lingers on my mind and tastebuds. Old Town is stepping up its foodie game with the grand opening of Social Tap. Amidst all the bars and hodgepodge eateries, I love that you have a classy sports bar with the chill vibe and good energy of a hot spot. Food was consistently good, actually rather amaze balls, so I have to give major kudos to the staff when you can ease through a grand opening with very little kinks. I think they purposely plucked all the eye candy available and hired them to serve to your every whim here. The décor is understated sexy with spacious patio seating, booths made perfectly for canoodling and bar stools that are plush on the bum. 

For starters, hands down I love the ahi poke and the sweet chili wings. I will say I prefer my ranch thicker so it sticks on the wings as I suck the life out of it. The chips and salsa with a side of guac, are addictive. The salsa has this hint of chipotle sweetness and spicy. If you want light, order the grilled shrimp tacos. How I managed to eat two after the starters is beyond my friends...what can I say, tiny girl big appetite. However, my eyes locked in on the rib-eye steak. Cooked perfectly how I like it but the only disappointing part was they ran out of mac-n-cheese on the soft opening night. You obviously know where this is leading to - return visit of course. Whether you want to close out weekend or start the week, Sundays have half off bottles of wine. Need I say more? Well actually, they'll tease you on Mondays with free dessert when you purchase two entrees and drinks. Why must you flirt shamelessly with me Social??!!!! 

This is a 4-star simply because I want to wait to update my review when the rooftop patio opens up. More importantly, I can't wait til football season!!! Just the right amount of TVs to keep my eyes glued on the games. Hopefully it will remain a neutral bar rather than a designated team spot. As their motto states - Eat. Drink. Be social. In the playground of pretentiousness, Social is a place you can be you. Stop in and pull a chair up next to me because most likely you'll see my happy face grazing on 3000 calories, often and here."}
{"text":"Nice place to get an afternoon snack and a few beers before a Giants Game at spring training. 
About the only thing I'd change is the breading on the fish, and a bit wider beer selection. Seems overly focused on local products."}
{"text":"I've only been here a few times and honestly, we are a fan! First time was for a fight and it was PACKED This didn't keep the bartenders from keeping up with the constant crowd and every single person had a good attitude.  The first time I was here with the hubs and an out of town friend. Really couldn't have been happier that we didn't have to become one of the crowd.

Second time was this past weekend for the Seahawks wildcard game. This time we were a group of 11!!!  Easily accommodated us in the back with our own TV and awesome server and wait staff. They were on the ball with making sure we all were happy customers.  

I've had the appetizers but not the FOOD yet. Eventually I will...It definitely looks and smells delicious. 

See you soon Social Tap!"}
{"text":"So disappointed in this place.  We came with a group and everyone had a bad experience.  It took forever to get service and even longer for our drinks to be made. Our waitress forgot two peoples drink orders so they had to wait another 15 min to get their drink.  After finally getting our drinks, we had to wait until the server took our food order.  The food came out soggy and greasy.  Not to mention she forgot two side dishes.  I will never go back to this place or recommend it."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times now. Brunch was delicious and our favorites include the short rib tacos and the royale burger (Big Mac-like). Salsa and chips with guacamole are also delicious. Ask for Taylor to be your server - she's great. Always happy and very attentive. We also enjoy talking with the manager, Cole. Patio is dog friendly and TVs everywhere. Nice place to grab a quick bite or stay and hang for a while with friends. We will def continue to frequent this place!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, food is very good & service was excellent. Highly recommend you come check it out! Ahi tacos rocked!! & cool outside misters for patio fun!!!"}
{"text":"Don't tell anyone but, this place is a gem. Visited before I officially moved to Arizona. Emily was so warm and welcoming. She was attentive, the champagne was cold, and the food was good. Came back 2 weeks later and she remembered me and congratulated me on the move. Girl what?? The gals here are awesome ( I see you Taylor and Taylor) Will be here every Sunday."}
{"text":"We were in town from New Jersey for a bachelorette party. Taylor was our waitress and crushed it...(she also has a stellar cactus tattoo.) The buffalo wings were amazing and you can't beat the $15 champs.  Great Sunday football vibe!!"}
{"text":"Come check out this new spot!!! Gotta love the Chicken Dinner and brussel sprouts app. Great beer selection."}
{"text":"We came here for Happy Hour. The place looked fun with great outdoor sitting so we decided to try it out. We were quite disappointed. Boring food. We ordered chicken tenders, Ahi tuna sliders and Halibut fish and chip. They did not taste fresh and the taste was below average. We sat outside, on the west wing of the patio, when the wind blew, we could smell the dumpster 

We wanted to like this place and come back but unfortunately, we will pass in the future."}
{"text":"So this is the second time that we've been here and it continues to be pretty great. Food is definitely above what you would expect from a  bar with large flat screens. The interior is upscale and the good is too. And we are foodies for sure. Should have taken photos of dinner but the thyme chicken on risotto is flavorful each time, the short rib plate is tasty as well and you can't go wrong on any of the tacos.  Give this place a shot. You won't be disappointed. Servers are really nice and on top of it."}
{"text":"First of all I rarely write poor reviews. I accidently left my card there. Called 15 minutes later asked for them to look up my card. 1st they hung up on me. I called back and asked if they could look up my card. But then she said the she can't hear me and I said that's cause it's loud at your bar can you step away and talk to me. She said no. Horrible service"}
{"text":"We we're out for a girls night out, and the owner, Steve, made it a great evening by helping me out when one of the waitresses accidentally spilled something on me. He handled me and my girls with grace, gave us free drinks, and we left there feeling amazing and very well taken care of!  Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"I recommend the Royale with cheese. It's one of the best burgers in Old Town (funny that there are a few restaurants devoted to just burgers and this place makes a better one). Service is always solid, I love the patio and they're very dog friendly. If you want a chill spot without the madness of Old Town come here."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Had the short ribs dinner. Very tender and tasty, as were the carrots and grits that came with the dinner. Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"Great food and drink selections! A cool place to go for happy hour and to hang out with friends.The bar is awesome and the bartenders are very friendly. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I don't know how they can pass those tacos off as actual tacos. Tacos tasted like faucet water and any time you picked one up all this liquid would fall and cover the entire plate and made the shell soft. Also that chicken should be axed because it tasted like chicken from a can. I give it 3 stars instead of one because it's more of a bar then dining. So only drink and not eat here."}
{"text":"The remodeled location looks nice. Door guy was friendly as we walked in. The bar had a ton of beers on tap however the service at the bar is horrible! Walked in and sat at the bar with perhaps 10 other customers who were already sitting there. There were 2 bartenders working and we were not even acknowledged for 10 minutes. As a previous bartender I'm a tolerant customer since I know how things can be so I will give a tip to these bartenders...if you have new customers that sit at your bar and you are going to make the service well tickets and/or make the other patrons drinks before you greet the new customers at the bar then at least acknowledge their existence and tell them you will be right with them."}
{"text":"Big parties = no 
Multiple people didn't get their orders for 1.5 hrs. 
The servers were nice but seriously the coordination of their server team had many gaps. Food was average."}
{"text":"Awesome awesome and more awesome. Great selection of beer and spirits. The bartender's are very friendly and hold great conversations with the customers. Joe, one of the bartender's is a hoot.  Tammy the other bartender is fun and super adorable. The music selection is sweeeeeeeeet.  This is a must when you visit Scottsdale. Enjoy!!!!!"}
{"text":"A solid spot in the area to congregate amongst friends, catch some sports, and get some solid food.  I know this sounds like 75% of the options in Oldtown but this place has a comfortable congeniality that most of the others can't match."}
{"text":"I really love their Sunday brunch, I highly recommend the sauteed shrimp tacos. The environment is relaxed and clean and the service is friendly. It's on my top list of spots in Old Town for drinks and surprisingly good food."}
{"text":"This place has become a go to for me since I work close by love the atmosphere and the employees are pretty great. The food is out of this world flavorful, the portions are generous and the drinks are on point. I just wish there was a better happy hour and more choices for starters, but otherwise this place is a favorite."}
{"text":"Great food, drinks and happy hour. Really nice place to grab a drink and catch a game. Their wings and nacho apps are great"}
{"text":"My first and only visit to this place was yesterday for football Sunday. Considering that, I expected it to be busy. However, this was crazy. I met a group of girls out who had a table. Sat down and was not acknowledged by the waitress for about 30 minutes. Went up to the bar to get a drink which was an equal nightmare. Stood there for 15 minutes with a group of guys who also were having a ridiculously hard time getting a drink. Finally see our waitress so go back to my table to order...they had the summer shandy tap on so I asked for that. Waitress comes back with an Oktoberfest made by the same company, says the restaurant hasn't changed the tap handle yet...fine, I take it because I don't want to wait another hour for a drink. Still charges me for the beer even though it was brought to me before I was asked if that was ok, just assumed. I happen to like Oktoberfest anyway but it's more the principle. There were 6 of us and she just brings over one tab, doesn't ask if we want the bill split. Overall terrible, with all the other spots in old town probably won't be back, even though the bar itself is super cute and has a lot of potential."}
{"text":"Recently went here for lunch on a Saturday. It was the first time we visited since the new build out and really like what they did with the property/building. It was pretty dead and I'm thinking it was because it was 110 out and also a ton of people were moving into the dorms so I'm sure a lot of people were busy. Any who...I ordered the ahi poke app for lunch and my boyfriend ordered the teriyaki bowl. I really enjoyed my poke but wish it had a few more of the won ton chips as there were not enough to eat the entire thing but I finished it with the fork and was still just as tasty! My boyfriend doesn't eat onions or bell peppers and his bowl was loaded with them so he really only had the rice and teriyaki chicken. He said it was ok but looking forward to trying something else next time we go.

Service was great and everyone was friendly!"}
{"text":"Came her for some appetizers before we started our night. We had the beef nachos, pulled pork sandwich and buffalo wings and they were great! Our waitress was very nice I can't remember her name but she was a brunette and she worked on Saturday night 8/5 around 8:30pm. I also really liked that they had a patio with games (even though we didn't  get a chance to play) it was nice knowing we had the option! Definitely try this out if your looking for some good appetizers!"}
{"text":"This is a cool place in Scottsdale. Went there for breakfast and drinks. Food was good. They have a great beer selection. David the manager was very helpful about the area."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere - it wasn't too crowded on a Saturday night (9 p.m.), and we were seated right away. The truffle fries and seafood burrito (get it with fried shrimp!) were awesome. Our server Cindy was great! 

And...the bartender was very generous with our drinks! I'll be back."}
{"text":"Just came in today for my moms birthday brunch after receiving a 50% off coupon in the mail. The food was amazing! We got breakfast burger, chicken and waffles, French toast and a salad. The patio and the interior of the restaurant are very well designed. I don't know why more people don't come here! 
Also our server was great. She was out bearing the heat with a smile on her face and a baby in her belly. I can't imagine that it's very fun working outside. 
We will definitely be back to check out happy hour and other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Great time getting drinks here before we went out! Service was great as were the food and drinks. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"came from out of state,  sat at the table for 10 min. and didn't even get seen. So we left."}
{"text":"Last night I had a good friend in town that I previously worked with and he wanted to meet and catch up so he suggested this place for an early dinner and some drinks.  We sat in the patio which was pretty nice but the we had to go in and ask for someone to wait on us and get us some drinks.  After the waitress got our drinks, my wife didn't like her glass of wine so I brought it to our server's attention.  Instead of say \"let me take that one back and get you something different\", she let it sit there even after my wife ordered a different wine.  We ordered the chips/salsa/guacamole, seared Ahi tuna and the brussel sprouts.  The sprouts didn't come out with the other two appetizers and the server said they had to cut more so it will be a few.  When they finally came out, they were still a bit crunchy hard but the flavor was good.  As for the guacamole, not impressed at all. Didn't have any flavor and the salsa was average.  The Ahi was decent.  We ordered our entrees and I had the shrimp and fish tacos.  The grilled shrimp were more like sautéed shrimp but undercooked.  The ceviche was horrible and tasted like vinegar.  My wife also had the shrimp taco and she said the same thing but also added \"I bet we leave here with food poisoning\".  That didn't happen but it was very disappointing since the pictures of the food looked so good online.  With a bill that was over $100 even after a glass of wine was taken off, we left there less than thrilled.  Sorry Social Tap, we won't be back.  Reminder folks:  this is a sports bar and not a \"restaurant\" even though they serve food."}
{"text":"Just pure amazing burgers. And they are huge. The beef is nice amd juicy. And their combination of flavoring really brings out the taste. The buns are nice and thick with a fresh clean taste. And each burger has a large side of fries. The fries are good, not the best. But a nice thing to chew while you take a break from eating their monster burgers. 
I constantly use ubereats to get delivery straight to my place. They are fast and the food is always warm. It's perfect method when you are craving a delicious burger, but too engaged in t.v to leave. 
Also, you can use my code, eats-mbdvx , to get $10 off your next delivery through ubereats."}
{"text":"Got sat.  Right in the middle of the patio in plain view.  Waited 20 mins.  Not even so much as eye contact by a server.  Walked out."}
{"text":"Pretty cool bar.  Happy hour 3-6,  we tried the filet mignonette tacos - surprisingly good (And filling).

Good selection of beer and a good place for a reasonably priced meal.  

Very friendly staff and we ran in to the owner of another nearby bar having dinner - so that have that going for them.

Definitely worth looking this place up.  Good food, very friendly staff and good selection of beer and wine."}
{"text":"I came in today on a whim and had fish tacos and don Julio. The tacos were amazing and the chips were just what I like. I am very particular and my server Michelle did everything that I requested and was very friendly. The patio is large and open and was very relaxing with the misters on. It was like air conditioning was outside. I had a nice afternoon and will absolutely return."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, food, and SERVICE.  Our bartender (dark hair long eyelashes) went above and beyond to make us welcome! She's the whole package.  Truffle tacos are a must have and the frozen margarita hit the spot, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We were in Scottsdale from California to see Spring Training. Our cousins were in town from New York/New Jersey for a conference. We wanted a place for a nice dinner together. Social Tap was recommended to us when we could not get reservations at a reasonable time at a nearby restaurant. As we walked up, we were greeted by the sound of twenty-something families, including children, playing games and yelling on the patio. If you are looking for a place to drink beer and be loud with your friends. This is your place. If you want to have a nice conversation over a nice dinner, stay away. I agree with my daughter that the food was bland. I ordered two street tacos one with pork and one with steak. I could not tell the difference by the taste. The only thing saving this evening from being a total disaster was the staff. They seated us in a quiet corner in the back of the restaurant and were very professional as they took care of us."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour with family and they had some good options  and reasonable prices. Staff were really nice and we're very patient with my grandma."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! I came here with a friend for brunch on Sunday and the first thing I noticed was the spacious patio. It's dog friendly so I'll definitely be bringing my dog in the future! We sat at the bar and we were greeted right away by Ashlyn, she was so friendly and knowledgeable of the menu and drink items. I ordered the chicken and waffles and my friend ordered the fruit and granola. Food came out in a timely manner and it was delicious! I will definitely be coming back for the food and excellent service here."}
{"text":"Was invited to the grand opening and I was impressed with how they remodeled and constructed this place to be hard to recognize this use to be the old after hours firehouse location. Staff was friendly even though it was busy and packed. Waiting for drinks didn't take that long which shows the efficiency of the bartenders. Didn't get a chance to try the food but I will for sure come visit again to try the food at another time for sure. The decor was awesome and the environment is fun for a large group to start there nights out first here!"}
{"text":"I came here with a group for Happy Hour last week. We were all very impressed with the atmosphere, drink selection, service, and food. We ordered a few appetizers like the calamari, brussel sprouts, buffalo chicken sliders, and pulled pork sliders. They were delicious and had an modern flair to them. I tried two of their cocktails and really enjoyed the Skinny Press. 

The whole restaurant is really cool. It would be a great place to watch a football game (if I was into that) or bring a large group. They also have plans to open a sweet rooftop deck.

My only small comment is the lack of parking. They only have three assigned parking spaces so you just have to find a place to park in the area or walk a few blocks from a parking garage. I would highly recommend trying out this place! I will be back to test out the full menu and more drinks!"}
{"text":"Ate here a few months ago. Hate writing bad reviews but feel this one is necessary. The food was really really good but the atmosphere was way too loud for our taste. We came here as a party of 6 and we couldn't even hear the person sitting directly next to us talking. Our food was delicious and our waiter was very friendly. 

A few minutes after we received our food, one of the light fixtures fell from the ceiling onto our table and made a very loud crashing noise. It was only a few inches from hitting my mom on the head. It fell on her plate of food. Not knowing what is was or where it came from (and it was a little frightening) we panicked. The hostess came over to us and asked what happened and we asked to see a manager. 

The manager didn't act like it was a big deal which was very frusterating. It could have really injured my mom. They ended up giving us half off of our meal which was very nice, but the music shouldn't be so loud that the light fixtures fall out of the ceiling onto their customers. I understand this is a social setting but turn it down a little please! For the sake of your customers safety!!"}
{"text":"Experienced bad service by JUST THE OWNER at Social Tap. The owner came by twice asking when we were going to leave (clearly trying to rush us out). A minute after the second time, a busser came by and took a friend's food when she wasn't finished. Soon after THE OWNER came by and took her beer which was still half full. We ended up complaining to the owner about the bad service by him and he threw our server under the bus. He called him a bad server in front of us probably three times, and did not take responsibility for the fact that he (the owner) was the one who took the unfinished beer and rushed us out (likely by calling the busser over to clear off our table). What kind of boss does that? I am not just unhappy about the service here by the owner, but about the way that our perfectly fine server was treated by his boss. Won't be back to support this business."}
{"text":"Fun place with trivia on Wednesday which my group won. Food was good but need some hardier offers."}
{"text":"I am never ever coming back here again.  I have been to the Social Tap in San Diego but since we were in Scottsdale we thought let's just go so my friends and I came here for fight night.  Well we decided to order fries, and we put in our order and waited a good forty five minutes.  So by this time we figured \"Oh he must have forgotten about our fries so should we just cancel it?\".  We all agreed to cancel the ONE side order of french fries because why would it take forty-five minutes to fry french fries? I have no idea why.  Well as i approached our server he decides to say \"You know what? You're fvked up for cancelling your order.  Like really fvcked up\" in front of our ENTIRE GROUP.  I was applaud because why in the world would you ever talk to a guest like that?  OH MY GOODNESS it gets even better so after we cancel the order we decide to leave and as we are leaving someone grabs me aggressively by my arm and yells \"YOU HAVE A BILL TO PAY\" and I responded \"Excuse me? My I please speak to a manager?\" He goes \" I am the manager\" I am like \"Well lovely, that is no way to treat a guest and I am not paying for a side of french fries that I waited forty-five minutes for and NEVER received them so you can keep your hands off of me!\"
Definitely, never coming back to the Scottsdale location."}
{"text":"Huge space with a ton of TVs! Very cool atmosphere and fun spot to go after work for drinks"}
{"text":"Came here with my boss for dinner early December. Truffle tacos are the only thing I'd get again! They were delicious and well worth it. Also got a berry vinaigrette salad that was pretty bad--just not compiled to taste good. So avoid salads here! Also had pork shoulder taco which was also not so good. Super salty. Didn't want to finish the pork and salad. So if you come for food I can only recommend the truffle steak tacos."}
{"text":"We went in very hungry. Enjoyed the 1/2 price bottles of wine on Sunday's for sure. We tried the calamari (can't beat calamari with chorizo cooked in it), Cali bowl, beef melt sandwich, and Mac and cheese. All were exceptional besides the Mac and cheese. The Mac was a build your own, so admittedly, we chose the ingredients, peppers and chicken. The Mac just didn't have the texture and consistency I expect from restaurant grade Mac. Mac aside, I was so impressed with the calamari, Cali bowl, spicy salsa, homemade salad dressing, and sandwich that I'm excited to go back for tacos and burgers. If they just had a few more tv's I think we could trade in our local sports stop for social tap!"}
{"text":"I went on a Saturday night- loud music, sports highlights playing, music videos playing. Great drink menu! I got the Moscow mule, but next time I'll try something different. My friend ventured off and got this strawberry fruity drink and it looked yummy. Ordered nachos with chicken and it was delish. It definitely is a sit down bar/restaurant, but it is confidently walking distance to the rest of old town. I think it would be a great place to watch a game and for a casual night."}
{"text":"This place definitely exceeded my expectations. We came at 630 on Thursday and it was packed. We sat inside where it wasn't too crowded (everyone seemed to be on the patio) and there were lots of TV's which is awesome. The menu is huge, & there's tons of options. I got a glass of wine, a bowl of the chili and a shrimp taco. Both were delicious and spicy, especially the chili. My boyfriend got one of their own Social tap beers & said it was great and also tacos (mix & match). Really pleased with everything and we will be back for sure."}
{"text":"The food was amazing which surprised me for a bar.  Prices seemed fair and service was also good.  Will certainly come back!"}
{"text":"Attended the UA Wildcats athletics event that was held here last night to talk about the strength of the UA athletic program in general and introduce the new football coach Kevin Sumlin.  Our youngest daughter just wrapped up her freshman year at UA and we are members of the Wildcat Club, so my wife and I decided to take the clan to do some mingling with other local UA folks.  The Alumni Association had rented out the entire restaurant for the evening and even though the free food was advertised as \"snacks\", it was actually a lot more than that - buffet style build-your-own tacos, nachos, carnitas, bbq pulled pork sliders, chicken wings, mac&cheese and a salad station.  There was a massive amount of food.  Non alcoholic beverages were also supposed to be provided gratis.  My wife and older daughter had adult beverages while our soon-to-be UA sophomore and I had soda. 

The restaurant was packed for the event!   I hit the buffet and made one carnitas taco, a plate of nachos, and grabbed a few grilled chicken wings for our table.  The carnitas was mediocre and fatty, the nacho cheese sauce I poured over the nicely crisped tortilla chips was pretty tasty and obviously of high quality.  I did not try the wings, but both daughters said they were good.   

There were a lot of bartenders.  Our oldest daughter paid cash for our first round of drinks which took a painfully long time (one glass wine, one tap beer, one lemonade, one coke, one ice water w lemon).   I paid for our second round of drinks with cash which took almost no time at all (different bartender).   Oldest daughter had one additional beer and she paid cash for that (original bartender, excruciating amount of time for one tap beer).   Despite that, after the event was over, the original bartender suddenly appeared at our booth near the bar and asked me out of the blue what my name was.   Since my family was in the middle of a conversation I was a little bit surprised so I just said \"what?\".  She repeated \"what is your name\".  I told her and then said \"why do you ask?\" to which she replied \"you need to close out your tab\".  I explained that we did not have a tab and had paid cash for our drinks, at which time she simply turned to my daughter and said \"you had a tab though\".  My daughter replied that she did not and had paid cash for her drinks.  Bartender's response was to turn and walk away while saying she swore one of us had a tab.  We were left in silence for a moment before I explained to the family that maybe they had had a few people who though alcohol was free and had perhaps walked out on their tabs and so were just double checking with the remainder of the guests.  

I really liked the atmosphere, layout of the restaurant and awesome patio.  The massive amount of food was good for a buffet style function like that and they definitely have a great beer and wine list.  I did not like the one bartender's attitude or the level of service she provided (and after the event I noticed that she had charged us for the non-alcoholic drinks which were supposed to be gratis), but the other bartender was friendly and expedient.  

I'll go back again."}
{"text":"We come here often. The staff is great and friendly and the happy hour is good. We have usually had good appetizers (chicken wings cooked right) We came here to watch the Patriot/Titans game and had drinks and appetizers.  The chicken wings were under cooked and the brussel sprout plate was underwhelming consisting of 4 sprouts quartered with bacon sprinkled on top.  This is not what we have experienced in the past. I do understand they were busy but this is no excuse. If you are busy increase your staff or SLOW down so your food is cooked properly. People get sick on under cooked chicken!!!!"}
{"text":"Had dinner with my husband, daughter and son in law.  The weather was perfect and we sat on the patio.  It started off ok with our server and a trainee in tow asking us about drinks. They came....one at a time.  From then on we had to constantly look for a server to order food and drink.  We ordered our food at one time, but everything came out 5-10 mins apart.  We were told\" oh yours will be right out\".  The food was mediocre.  There are 15 other places to eat within a 5 minute walk.  We will try all of them before we ever go back."}
{"text":"They have plenty of tv's to watch the nba finals on. Ordered their wings and mojito. Overall taste was good. My fiancé ordered their nachos & some beer. He seemed to enjoy the food as well. Our server was great. She kept checking on us and made sure we got everything we needed."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Our waitress Ashley was a pure delight!! Loved the wings!! One of the chefs came out to get our feedback. Gotta say Freddy is holding it down back there where it matters most. Great experience!!"}
{"text":"We had an amazing experience at Social Tap in Scottsdale! We were visiting from out of town and came in on Cinco de Mayo. We were greeted by a really sweet hostess and sat almost immediately! The service was excellent and the food tasted amazing! I got tacos and my husband got a burger. They both were cooked perfectly and came out fast too! The place was very busy and we still got great customer service! We will be coming back soon!!! :)"}
{"text":"Omg this place rocks! Our food was out of this world delicious. I had the beef dip, and what a tantalizing spin on a hearty classic. The poblano chile and mushroom topper with crispy shallots provided a beautiful experience for my palate and the horseradish aioli really made this classic shine! The grilled fish tacos were cooked to perfection and nice n light and fresh for a sunny day.  Jessica provided excellent, attentive service with great recommendations for dishes and exuded extensive knowledge of the menu and how things are executed. They are dog friendly too! The re model from the stinky frat  firehouse that it used to be is absolutely gorgeous. The best part about it all? $39 bux for an appetizer, two full entrees with a special addition, and two drinks. My wallet was very happy. The vibe was really fun too, everyone was in a great mood, strangers were chatting with each other, great place to mingle if you're single! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The best atmosphere in Old Town! The coolest building, best food and they have a selection of their own brewed beer along with a selection of local beers on tap. Their breakfast rocks too!"}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour after work on Friday.   Ordered a little bit of everything from both menus.  The food and drinks were great!  Did seem a bit understaffed at the time which i thought was weird given that day of the week."}
{"text":"This place treats you like family. The staff, specifically calling out Melissa, is completely welcoming and willing to discuss drinks and food with you. She makes you feel at home and very welcome anytime you show up. The great thing is, she recognizes you if you come back, making this place feel like your home away from home. I will definitely come back here every time I'm in Scottsdale! Thank you Melissa!"}
{"text":"Great patio, really friendly staff, good beer selection, good music. Haven't tried the food yet but we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Had so much fun at Social Tap for Sunday Funday! I LOVED being able to choose between brunch / lunch even at 1 pm. I ordered 1 carne asada taco and 1 shredded chicken taco! They were really good - and nicely sized! For drinks we ordered the frozen margaritas (really good) and my friend got the frozen peach rosé that was quite delicious. Another note: patio was awesome even on a brutal Arizona day. They have fans + misters! So sitting outside was a lot of fun. We'll be back, Social Tap!"}
{"text":"The food is good but the best part of this place is the open layout. It has a great patio with games and is perfect for large group parties."}
{"text":"Cool place but way too loud for my taste. We came on a Saturday afternoon and the game was on so loud we had to shout across our table.

Also, multiple ID checks was kind of annoying. I get we were in old town but at 1pm I think IDing at the table/bar is more than enough."}
{"text":"Great place to chill in the heat. They have top of the line misters that keep the patio cool during the blazing hot summer days. 

The only compliant.....The portion sizes on the salads and many other entree items are like little bite sized appetizers. I mean I get the whole Scottsdale chic vibe with the ginormous plates. However,!when a guy is hungry and orders an entree he shouldnt have to double order in order to get a decent amount of food. 

If you go there just get the burger. Everything else is like a small bite sized appetizer.

Enough of my ranting. I was just extremely hungry and the 16 dollar salad that I finished in 4 bites was hangrily disapointing. 

Everything else about the place is awesome!! 5 Stars if you fix the food situation."}
{"text":"REVIEWER # 50

Social Tap is a great hang out spot in Scottsdale. It's a great relaxed atmosphere with good music and TV's (Playing music videos) located all throughout the bar and outside. 
 
Once I walked in I was greeted right away from the amazing bartender Joe! As we all know AZ can get REALLY hot and I was happy to see that once I sat down I had a nice cold ice water as I was handed a menu for the evening. The food menu at Social Tap is made up of build-your-own salads, burgers, sandwiches, an array of tacos and burritos, rice bowls and entree plates. 

After hearing so much about their Ahi Poke I had to give it a try and I am happy I did. The Ahi Poke was delicious! I was able to sit at the bar and people watch on a lovely Saturday night. The bartender (Joe) and I was able to discuss the bar a little bit and I learned that they are recently new to the community and just opened up last year. 

DID YOU KNOW: This bar doesn't offer Cîroc but Joe said that it's something that he is looking into.

I have to admit that they have a wonderful alcohol selection and they have great options for beer (I'm not a beer drinker but I'm just saying!)

They had so many options for food that I wish that I had put it on my itinerary and made it my \"to-do\" but instead I came so late that I wasn't able to try as much as much as I wanted to. Next time I come I would want to try their wings. (I may just have to go explore the Ventura location)

They also have a great outdoor dining area which is great for people watching and also bringing your fur babies! Yup, you guessed it! This place is pet friendly! With a large outdoor dining area and bar, enjoy local craft beer in the middle of Old Town. Whether you are having a night out with friends or enjoying a weekend brunch, this place is a must do when in the area. 

It's a great food and bar joint. They also have locations in Ventura and San Diego and when I was SD I missed out on this place so I was happy to have the chance to try them in Scottsdale.

{"text":"Great restaurant and bar!!! Came here with a few friends to get some lunch and drinks and we got great fast service from Emily! She was so smiley and talkative. Food was very tasty and seemed fresh. Location was close to the mall and a bunch of other bars! Would definitely recommend this place to a friend and will be coming back soon! Thanks Social Tap!"}
{"text":"Social Tap is definitely my favorite brunch/breakfast spot in Downtown Scottsdale. There are tons of choices in the area, but we only do Social Tap because of the cool vibe and great food... and of course, the drinks! 

Everyone here is super cool and attentive. There's never a long wait for food or drinks. 

Special shout out to both Taylors, Emily, and Cole!"}
{"text":"We decided to head up to Old Town looking for a breakfast spot and found Social Tap. It had both some college football games on while also having the Red Sox v Yankees game on. I do believe the NASCAR race was also on when we first sat.

Service was spot on as was the food. The ladies ordered mimosa while I opted for a coke. Food was awesome. I ordered the chorizo breakfast burrito, wifey had the waffles with cheesy eggs, sausage and bacon, while our friend who came out with us had the fish and chips."}
{"text":"Great spot and perfect location!   The food was delicious and the bartenders were quick to fill your drink.  Great outside patio and nice decor throughout.  The owners were very hands on and clearly cared to make sure their customers were pleased.  We'll definitely be putting Social Tap in the regular rotation!"}
{"text":"Beer list is lacking for a place called \"Tap\", nothing special or that you can't get everywhere else. Cocktails tasted like mixer and not much else. Food was above average. This place really just seems like another trying too hard to fit the mold of craft beer and American food, definitely better options. Doubt we make it back."}
{"text":"Loved the food, the service was ok. I had the fish and chips and my friend had the teriyaki bowl. Both were cooked wonderfully, and we had a few great Moscow mules as well.  Old town is really getting better!!"}
{"text":"Compared to the old Social Tap, this place is amazing! It's a very nice space and there are no shortages of TVs to catch football games on. Do be aware, it seems to be a Ravens bar (not bashing, just informing). Sunday brunch has a solid menus with a lot of different choices. I also really recommend trying their Iced Tea!

One of my new favorite places in Old Town!"}
{"text":"Met some friends here Wednesday night during the game. Friend and I split wings while our other friends had ceviche. The place was really cute and it was hard to track down servers they seemed a little swamped. The food was bomb but not even thirty minutes after we were all sick. I didn't even have ceviche and I came later on..got super sick from the wings I guess? Want to give this place the benefit of the doubt but it's no coincidence we all got sick #neveragain"}
{"text":"Good food and a good happy hour. However the drinks are SUPER weak. I'd recommend sticking with beer here. Even asking for a double I guess meant double cranberry.  Truffle fries and chicken strips were good. Just disappointed in the drinks"}
{"text":"Four stars for tasty food, minus a star for the slow service at lunch.  Try the cheddar burger, the grilled scallions were very tasty!  If you are in a hurry for lunch, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Manager was a complete jerk! He was obviously hungover and had no customer service skills!"}

{"text":"Visiting this place from California I have some biases in food so maybe I'm not the best at rating this place on their food.

Food wise: we when with the chilaquiles and the poke chips. Chilaquiles are normally suppose to have eggs mixed in with the chips. They had all the ingredients separated so it's basically.. tomatoes, alvocado and chips with cheese not really a true chilaquiles. I hate to say this but the poke was the worst I've ever had. The fish wasn't fresh but I am in Arizona. The seasonings wasn't correctly made either. 

Service wise: The waitress wasn't happy to be here and it was easy to tell. Maybe she was having a bad day.

Ambience wise: it's more of a bar scene. They have a live DJ and NFL games on a bunch of different tv's which is why I give it a decent review.

Price wise: for the quality. It's not worth the food. 

Overall: I'm not from here so I'm probably not gonna come back but if I was I question if I would for the food.. For the ambience, maybe.."}
{"text":"Just ordered some chili from Social Tap using Uber Eats. Guess the staff must be drunk because I don't know what's going on with this packaging! Every time I order I add guacamole and they always forget it!"}
{"text":"1st timers! Loved it. Excellent food, great place to hang out and/or watch sports. Huge patio, very cool bar. Staff was tops!"}
{"text":"I've been to social tap a few times, normally against my choice. The first time I visited the server spilled half my beer on me and didn't care to fill it up or take it off my bill. The 2nd time, I reluctantly returned or a work HH and again the service was far below average. Tonight my husband and I just visited social tap, since the wait was nonexistent. It's now 6:50 on a Friday night. We were seated at the bar for 15 minutes, with 3 bartenders behind the bar none of which acknowledged us. Even a \"hey be with you in a minute\" would be appreciated. It appeared one gentlemen was strictly doing table/server orders. One of the bartenders walked past us multiple times, but didn't care to acknowledge 2 new patrons. We will never be back. tl;dr: service sucks, don't go here."}
{"text":"This place is Nice & has a chill atmosphere. The service was good and their beer was tasty! I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"My family's been hitting up this place for a while so it was only a matter of time before I was dragged along.

It's a super nice set up -- big open doors letting the outside come inside. The staff was super nice and accommodating for my grandpa as well. 

Everyone in the group loved their food. And my husband was happy to see so many Gluten-Free options (marked on the regular menu no less!). I enjoyed my Social Tap mimosa and breakfast sandwich. 

Cannot wait to go back and try some of the lunch menu!"}
{"text":"Lively new space in Old Town and comfortable patio seating, unlike many other nearby spots with outdoor tables packed too closely. Our table split the ahi tuna poke (which kept being pronounced \"poke\" instead of \"po-kay\" - just a tip for the staff!), chicken tenders, and grilled shrimp tacos. All were fairly portioned for their price points, but the poke was nothing extraordinary and the salsa accompanying the tacos had no spice/kick at all; it was like water. The watermelon Social Rita tasted like a tangy Jolly Rancher (this is a compliment) and the Skinny Press was delightfully refreshing and perfect for a sunny Scottsdale Saturday. Overall, a pleasant experience, would definitely go back, but for the cocktails and atmosphere, not for the food."}
{"text":"Five stars for an awesome sports bar! The patio outside is huge and they have plenty of TV's outside and inside. A big THANK YOU for hosting the Auburn Tigers! If you are looking for a place to watch football or any sports this is the place to go. I love the nachos but everything on the menu is delicious. Thanks again for hosting the Auburn WAR DAMN EAGLE"}
{"text":"Word to the wise, arrive before 7pm when Happy Hour ends!  Luckily for us we arrived at 6:58 and flagged down a waitress like our life depended on it!  The beer was delicious as were the two burrito bowls we had.  

We were at a kickball team dinner before a bar crawl and the food definitely was fuel for our belly!  I'd love to come back and check this place out because the outside patio looks ridiculously fun.  They have cornhole/bags outside along with a nice patio and seating area.  There were tv's inside to watch all your favorite games.

What a great spot with great service.  I must say they didn't disappoint.  See you again next year!"}
{"text":"Sara and Amanda are friendly and attentive bar tenders. Great spot for watching sports from a sunny patio!"}
{"text":"Visiting Scottsdale this weekend and decided to try Social Tap. Very modern relaxed atmosphere. Good music, not too loud but loud enough. Great vibe all together. Bartender was wonderful.... It's very hot this time of year and our water glasses were kept full as well as our alcoholic drink requests. 
Both times we came we weren't very hungry and ordered light. Shared steak nachos one evening and tacos the second. Food was very good and portions perfect! 
Will definitely be back in our next visit and recommend that you come check it out as well."}
{"text":"Fun, laid-back patio atmosphere w/ a Scottsdale hint. Perfect for meeting friends for an afternoon Happy Hour."}
{"text":"This is a great bar and what I like best about it, is the outdoor patio with all of the misters.  The staff are friendly, there is plenty of seating, lots of drinks and food.

For \"bar food,\" they do a decent job.  It's not your typical menu full of fried food.  This weekend, I enjoyed the tuna poke and the Brussels and my friends enjoyed wings and sandwiches.  My poke was okay, the avocado definitely wasn't ripe but it wasn't horrible.  The sauce however is delicious!  The Brussels were great with the balsamic and cheese.

They play good music and always have a great crowd in there.  Service is good but it was a little slow during the fight last night, they also were extremely busy though and the place was packed.

This is a local spot to me that's quick to get to, so I'll be back often.  I would like to try one of their salads next time, and some other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Well organized, clean and super nice staff.  Attentive, and always something (or someone) pretty to look at.  Best sports bar in Old Town."}
{"text":"Just checked this place out with some friends on Wednesday and really enjoyed it. They do trivia on Wednesdays and the employee that was running it was awesome and very engaging. The waitress was super nice as well and was very attentive. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Too many beers on tap to count. Tons of Tvs to watch any sporting event you desire. The food is amazing. I am absolutely hooked on The Beef Manchengo Melt. We have been here several times and every time we have had a great experience. We ordered food Togo one time and got it home and everything we needed was included. The food was packaged correctly and everything tastes great. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The pork belly tacos I had here were some of the worst I've ever had. Social Tap has a fun environment for drinks, but stay away from the food. A number of my friends tried various items on their food menu and also had a negative experience."}
{"text":"My husband and I come here all the time! The food is great, especially the truffle fries (our personal favorite) and we absolutely love the filet mignon tacos! Highly highly recommend! The service is always great and the atmosphere is always fun."}
{"text":"Have been here twice.  Typical bar in the area with pub food.  The one benefit is that it is slightly off the main Scottsdale Rd.  drag so it doesn't seem to get as busy as Cold Beers and Burgers.  The chicken fingers were average and the cheese burger here was tasty.   It was 14 bucks for the burger.  Would come back here for happy hour to watch sports."}
{"text":"The place was okay, not very busy, plenty of TV's and food was okay. Service was great, wasn't wowed with the menu or selection."}
{"text":"It feels like management is fucking my ass with their inability to put the audio of a game on. No problem blasting good Charlotte but can't put the audio of the world championship game. Real shame"}
{"text":"I love going to Social Tap. The service is always spot on and the food is great. My favorite thing is the filet tacos. This is the best place to watch all sports but football season is the best."}
{"text":"Being in the serving industry I was so embarrassed to have Olivia. It was my first time in this place with a lot of recommendations and high hopes. Food was awesome and our server that took over was great. Although Olivia seemed to must hate her job??? Wasn't even busy so I'm a little confused. Unfortunate that the food is good but our server ruined the experience."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. Ordered the burrito. Not very good. Why the hell would you guys put romaine lettuce in a burrito? Served with a side of very bland salsa. However the service was good with a friendly staff. Just get rid of the damn lettuce."}
{"text":"My go to spot! Everything about this place makes you want to come back. Steve, the owner is always consistent in making rounds and saying hello to ensure everyone is having a great time and taken care of. Jaymee behind the bar is always on top of her game and drinks come out quick and she's always hilarious to chat with. The Buffalo chicken sliders are DELICIOUS especially paired with their Summer Shandy. Chad and Michelle are also rockstars that make up the team. Go once and you will be hooked!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a drink after work. They have a big PET FRIENDLY patio. The server brought a doggy dish full of water for my little puppy even before I had to ask. The music wasn't too loud. I was able to talk to my friends without screaming at the top of my lungs. They have a great happy hour - must try their truffle fries!! The service was outstanding. Definitely check this place out if you're looking for a outdoor patio happy hour! There's also ton of free parking around the back of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Taylor is amazing.  She's friendly and knows the menu. Now the place ran out if beef therefore I could not order my Beef and Manchego."}
{"text":"Worst service ever, don't bother. Their lady bartenders have no clue as to what they're doing. They keep their heads down and won't even make eye contact and walk past customers. We sat at the bar and didn't get acknowledged for almost half an hour, they wouldn't even bring the manager over to talk to us. Everyone in my group has worked in the industry and is experienced in great service."}
{"text":"Fun place. Not overly crowded on a Friday night and the drinks were reasonable. The owner Steve took good care of us!"}
{"text":"Visited on 6/30/16....what a pleasant surprise! Unlike all of the other old town Scottsdale venues, Social Tap actually has terrific wait staff, prompt, friendly and plenty of them.  The bartenders are knowledgeable about the craft beers they have, they are prompt, attentive and friendly.  I had the pulled pork sliders happy hour special and they were excellent.  I was there as part of a larger group and the wait staff met every one as they arrived, took their orders right away, engaged in conversation with the patrons, the food was not only good, it was prepared quickly...  I cannot tell you how refreshing it was to be somewhere in Scottsdale where everyone at the establishment actually acted like they were glad you were there and cared about their patrons.  Compliments to the entire crew.  This will be my first choice in old town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I met my AOB bud S here for lunch. Friday lunchtime and the place was empty. Hmmm, maybe it's just a happy hour / night time club type place. Idunno. All I know is I usually get scared when I'm in an empty restaurant.

S and I were politely greeted as we walked in. The menu has a lot of great sounding food on it. Unfortunately, sounding good isn't the idea.

S ordered the Beef & Manchego Melt ($14). This sandwich is sliced beef with a mushroom, poblano pepper and shallot mix, Manchego cheese, fried shallots and a horseradish aioli. It's all piled on a toasted ciabatta bun and served with Au Jus. S said the sandwich was good but nothing special.

I ordered the Turkey & Havarti Melt ($13). This sandwich is sliced roasted Turkey with fried shallots, mixed greens, sliced Tomato, Mustard aioli and Bacon Jam. The Turkey was a tad dry which the mustard aioli helped with a bit. The Bacon Jam was a miss. It added a funky taste which didn't meld well with the mustard aioli and melted Havarti. The kitchen team needs to rethink this one.
Both sandwiches came with salt & black pepper fries. They were decent, nothing special.

Overall, I think the prices are high for portion size. I realize we're in Scottsdale, but maybe that's why the place was empty for a Friday lunch. 
Average Service. Average Food. High Prices. 3 Stars."}
{"text":"Great Food! Great Atmosphere! Friendly & hard working staff! The filet mignon tacos and truffle fries were so yummy!! My husband loved the mac & cheese!!"}
{"text":"Awesome new bar with a great food and drink menu! They have lots of specials running through out the week, so make sure to keep an eye out for them. Love that the bar is on a street corner and its open space makes it inviting!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately that's the best rating I can give. I ordered through UberEATS and had to get a full refund because the entire order was incorrect! That's like you have to try to be that bad, do they not have a quality control person checking what goes out of the kitchen? I spoke with a manager, Dave I believe who said come in next time and he will give me a discount etc, but I am not really sure I'd want to try it again. Just beware if you order something through a delivery service you're rolling the dice so if you do want it I would go in person ! I ordered a fish taco sautéed and got fried fish, I ordered a bowl of soup, got a cup of cold tasteless soup missing the promised tortillas and avocados, looked like something out of a frozen bag and tasted like it too. Ordered a side of chips and salsa and received the salsa only. Orders a sandwich where the bread was cooked on one side, doughy wet and soggy on the other same for fries. Just all around bad experience"}
{"text":"Whenever we come to Scottsdale we ALWAYS stop and ask for Taylor's section! She is happy, wonderful, friendly and she makes our day! Come see this amazing girl. Thanks Taylor, we will see you in February!"}
{"text":"Not what I expected at all. Went in hoping for craft beers but left after a disappointing Social Tap pale ale or something.. the crowd was generation spanning which is great. But this place was trying way too hard. They have beers from other places but none of them were that interesting. I'd hit Craft 64 instead if you're looking for a variety."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and great service. Ordered food for the first time today and it was on point! Owner came over to say hello and asked how everything was which is great to see! Will def be coming back!"}
{"text":"The outdoor seating is really good.  TV's are HD and can be seen from many angles.  

The downside is the food is just a hit and miss.  The teriyaki chicken likely came from a freezer or a tv dinner.  Very bad.  The chips and salsa (we go with hot) was definitely above average toward great."}
{"text":"Nice little spot in Old Town Scottsdale. Good drink and food specials plus a daily happy hour and Sunday brunch. Food is made to order on point fresh and tasty. Staff is helpful and friendly. Definitely will be coming back"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere and love the upgraded bar food!  Great selection of fancy beers and nice wines at a great price!"}
{"text":"New favorite happy hour spot! Great food, ambience and service here. Lots of tvs to watch games and indoor/outdoor seating offered. One patio is designated as smoking and the other is non smoking, which is nice that they have them separated. 

We came with our baby on a Friday around 5:30pm for Happy Hour...yup, we're THOSE people that bring our baby to a bar  Shoot parents need to have fun too, right? We figure it's still semi-appropriate since it's light out! It was nice we didn't get any judging looks and our daughter was actually a big hit with the other customers sitting at a nearby table. Our waitress was super friendly and even made an effort to socialize with our little girl, which is surprisingly not the case at many restaurants. Music was fun and our 9-month old danced along to Too Legit To Quit and The Humpty Dance in her high chair-- which may have also been why she was a hit 

Food was great! Love the bacon brussel sprouts and I'll definitely be back for more very soon. Truffle fries and the dipping sauce were perfect so I ate every last one. Calamari has a sweet and tangy sauce and were pretty good. Wings were cooked to perfection, although I didn't love the sweet chili sauce (my husband did) I'd order a different sauce next time. Lots of happy hour food and drink specials that last till 6pm. My husband got a fruity purple frozen drink that he liked (yup, my 6'2\" man loves him some sweet, fruity drinks - it's actually pretty hilarious to see him sip them down ...I find it manly). 

We'll definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty had a really good layout.  The food was really good and the layout of the TVs made sure I didn't miss any of the action... So much so that the only way I could miss a play in the game was if looking down at my table the whole time."}
{"text":"In Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, most people
view the creation of the universe as one big mistake. I know one thing that wasn't though - Social Tap.

I've been here numerous times, but I went here for a Happy Hour recently and when I say it was bomb, I mean it in a way that will not blow your socks off, but your damn clothes.

Affordable drinks, affordable food, and courteous peeps, it's one of the best places to grab a drink and chill. 

All in all, this place is worth whatever amount of money you spend, and if you wanna full stomach while getting some liquid courage, this is the place to be."}
