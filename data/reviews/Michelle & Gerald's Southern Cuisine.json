{"text":"We decided to try this place after walking around during Glendale Glitters (everywhere else was packed, and this place was empty).  When we walked in, the woman who 'greeted' us was decidedly not welcoming.  We were the only ones in the entire restaurant (a converted house).  She asked we wanted to order before we even got a chance to look over the menu.  It took forever to get drinks though.  At NO TIME AT ALL was she friendly, chatty, welcoming, etc--it was very much like being an uninvited or unexpected guest in her private home.  

Being a working mom myself, I understand having your children around, but after having her son run across the room four times in 10 minutes it was very disconcerting and not hard to see WHY this place wasn't busy.  It took a good 40 minutes for food, which while tasty, shouldn't have taken 40 minutes to prepare (the only thing that would have taken a bit was chicken fried steak--everything else we ordered was 'slow cooked' therefore only needs plating!).  Bear in mind, the food was delicious, but I just wouldn't wait that long for food!  I'd recommend eating somewhere else unless you have well over an hour to kill and don't mind feeling like you are invading someone's private space."}
{"text":"They were at the Peoria Farmer's market today.  Husband and wife owners.  Very nice and personable.  And the food.....I got Rib Tips with red beans n'rice and mac n' cheese.  Came with cornbread too. I'll have to say the best BBQ I have ever had since moving to Arizona in 1993!!  Everything was excellent and I believe I will drive back there next weekend just to get their food!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I have ever received. My husband and I decided to try this restaurant because we wanted to try some home cooked breakfast. We walked in and was greeted by a lady whom I assumed was the owner.  First off, the place was undesirable to look at and we were the ONLY people in there. There wasn't any aroma of food being prepared. The lady looked at us as if she DID NOT WANT any customer! She basically, rolled her eyes and asked us, \"in side or out side?\" It was awful!

We chose inside, and she continued to provide this horrible attitude and demeanor while taking our order. After about 10 minutes of this behaviors my husband couldn't take it anymore!  He told her that she was very nasty and got up saying we refuse to eat here! 

We left and will Never come back! This is NOT THE PLACE TO EAT if YOU DESIRE GOOD COSTUMER SERVICE! We didn't even get to order any food because we couldn't tolerate her rude behavior!  I would give it ZERO stars but I had to give it one to write my review!"}
{"text":"As I was walking into the restaurant there was a woman taking a picture of two other women. I offered to take a picture of the three of them together. I asked them how their meal was. They said the food was good but the service was very slow and it had taken two hours for them to have lunch. 
I decided to give it a try anyway. It was after 2:00 PM on a Monday and I figured it shouldn't take that long. The first impression was that the server was not happy to see me. I sat down at a table and she brought a menu. The table had been cleared but it had not been wiped down. There were only two other parties at the restaurant. One was leaving. After sitting for over five minutes without the waitress coming over I decided to take to heart the women's warning and leave. As I was walking out I noticed how dirty the door was. If cleanliness isn't important in the front of the restaurant how important is it in the back?"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch on a Saturday, place was nearly empty, and other than a take out order that came in while we were there, we were their only customers.

Upon first arrival we were \"greeted\" by a woman that didn't appear too happy to have customers.  As the meal went on, the service definitely improved.  One complaint was the couple's child hanging out near the front.  As a working mother I certainly can't complain they brought their child to work, but whatever children's programming was on was blaring during our meal, competing with the musical selection playing through out the rest of the restaurant.  

After examining an extremely limited menu, my friend ordered the breakfast special and I ordered the biscuits and gravy.  While I appreciate that the effort went in to making a fresh biscuit for my meal, waiting 30+ minutes for it to be cooked and served should produce one amazing biscuit...sadly it did not.  The biscuit was flat and doughy, however the gravy was great.

I can't complain much about a breakfast for 2 costing less than $20, but I'm worried it wasn't the road construction keeping the customers at bay.  To be fair, I'll go in again and try to give it another go."}
{"text":"Very poor experience.  Rude waitress, hurried us to order though there were very few people there.  We waited 45 minutes for our food and when it arrived a side dish of mac and cheese was missing.  Waitress told us it wasn't missing, we didn't order it!  We like to support the independents, but would never return here."}
{"text":"We read Phillis H. review and were skeptical. Food was great, atmosphere was lovely, service was good! Recommend the pulled pork!"}
{"text":"Walked past yesterday mid afternoon on my way to the ice cream shop and it was closed, as well it should be. Ate there two weeks ago on a Saturday and it was one of the worse experiences ever. It was about 3:00 in the afternoon the place was empty. I did not have any cash on me and since the door has the Visa and MC signs we figured we would give it a try.
The lady who waited on us had the personality of a wall. No conversation .. not even a smile. I ordered the shrimp po boy and lemonade. The po  boy ...well ... ugh ... very, very bland, although the lemonade was tasty.
When it came time to pay the check, I pulled out my Visa and handed it to her. Well, at  this time she informs me  that her machine is down and I would need to walk the 3 blocks to the ATM. (Wouldn't you put a sign on the door informing people of that.) 
So, I walked 3 blocks to the ATM and 3 blocks back  and now my  tab has been increased by 2.00 for using the ATM. (I had also left the teen that was with me as collateral when I walked to the ATM)
When I returned and paid her she took the money no let me give you a a buck credit .. here's a lemonade on the house ... NOTHING and still not even a smile.
We truly felt like our dining there was an intrusion to her reading the paper on the porch. AWFUL."}
{"text":"Nice historic house, we dropped in for lunch and had the Po Boy Sandwiches with catfish and shrimp , service was great ! The lady that greeted us made conversation with us the whole time we were there making us feel at home and welcomed! We will definitely be back to try dinner next time"}
{"text":"If I could give it a 0 out of 5 stars I would.  A group of 6 of us started a saturday afternoon out for lunch.  We were excited about trying a new place.  We got to the restaurant at 12:05pm and the restaurant was closed even though I had called the day before to check the hours.
We decided to go to another restaurant in the area instead. After lunch, we passed by the place and now noticed they were open.  We decided to go in for dessert. 
Upon arrival, we were not greeted so after a few minutes we sat ourselves. Once seated,  an employee, I'm assuming the owner Michelle walked by several times without acknowleging us. (Please note there were only about 2 tables with guests)  About 10 minutes later, a menu was brought to the table but still no greeting.  We then asked what the hours were and told her we had tried to come for lunch.  She advised that they open at 7:30 am.  We then asked if they opened late today.  The only response we got was \"Yes\" then she walked away.
Next we placed our order.  We asked a question of how many beignets come in an order (she said 8) so we we're trying to figure out how many orders to get for 6 people.  She then said in a rude voice \"that she was really busy and that she had a big party coming in\"   which was  interpreted as hurry up and place your order and don't ask anymore questions.

The beignets came out about 45 minutes later.    When we left, as I am usually polite, I said thank you to the lady.  The lady's response was \"Uh huh\".  
Won't be back.  Probably the least friendly business owner I have ever encountered.  Not sure how they have stayed open this long"}
{"text":"We have dying to try this place. We finally walked in on a Friday nite in the mood for some good home cookin and were completely ignored. There were people sitting at small tables outside and inside,but no waiters to be seen. So we stood by the register waiting for a while..and waited and waited.. then a small child peeked his head out from a curtain and asked if he could play with my daughter, I wondered where was this child parent? So then we sat at a table and looked at a menu. A lady walked by with a tray of drinks and served them to the table beside us(she didn't look to happy at all) Then walked past us like we were invisible. We finally decided to leave it was just to weird. We really wanted to give this place a chance especially since its a local business in old town Glendale.  Very dissapointing!!!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a good southern experience.  Food was ok nothing special.  Service was a little slow for only 5 people in the place. Was a little disappointed."}
{"text":"I tried there rib tips, red beans & rice, Mac n cheese and corn bread at Glendale street food festival. It was the best bbq I have ever had. The ribs had a nice smoke flavor and very tender and  the sauce was so good. Red beans and rice was good too.  It was very filling and worth the $10. I also had the peach cobbler. It was $4 and was yummy.  I want to visit their restaraunt next time. They were very friendly and gave me their business card so I can visit their restaraunt."}
{"text":"Spotted this place a few weeks back when I had to detour around a street closing.  It originally opened over a year ago and was subsequently leased out for 3 months and then closed for about six months and has now been open for about 4 months under the original owners.  Gerald comes in and makes breakfast during the week and Michelle comes in about noon to help with lunch.  According to Gerald they initially had a successful restaurant about 43rd and Dunlap and were recruited into the area by the city of Glendale.  It took them a year to renovate the building to code while maintaining the structure to comply with the historic district.

I was the only customer there for an early lunch and ordered a pulled pork sandwich ($6.99) and a glass of iced tea ($1.99).  The sandwich came with a serving of cole slaw.  The bun was a bit on the small side, ok it was tiny, but there was enough meat that only about 1/2 was retained by the bun.  I liked the pork because it had some chew to it without being tough.  I also like the sauce that was sweet with a light burn.  They have other southern stuff on the menu like chicken and waffles, seafood poor boys, sweet tea.

Gerald is a better cook than a server.:-)  He went off and got my lunch going and then remembered to get my iced tea. He warmed up to being a nice person to chat with as I finished my lunch.

They have two small dining rooms and more seating on a wrap around porch.  The place looks sort of beat up but I think part of that is deliberate to fit into the historic district.  They open M-W for breakfast and lunch and Th-Sat for breakfast lunch and dinner.  Closed Sundays.  Most of the menu items are available any time no matter what section of the menu they are in.

I will go back at least once to try the chicken and waffles.

Update 6/4/10
I did indeed go back at lunch yesterday for chicken and waffles.  If you get a chicken breast you best not be in a hurry because it takes a while to fry one up.  I thought the batter may have been a bit overcooked but it was not all all greasy and the chicken inside was very juicy while being fully cooked.  The huge waffle was light and airy an served with a bowl of warm syrup.

I'm getting to really like this place and hope they get busy enough to stay around."}
{"text":"If I could give it a zero I would. We went during business hours and they were closed. Went back later in the day and the lady.owner was sooooo rude and their kid was running around and she thought it was funny. Tried to get a to go order of beignets and they didn't have any. Never again."}
{"text":"We were out at the chocolate festival and parked in front of this place. It looked warm and inviting so we decided to give it a try. The cafe was neat, clean and appears to seat 12-20 guests. 
However the owner looked unhappy to have us walk in as customers. She then pointed to a sign that stated cash only. 
She passed out the menus, meanwhile there was a TV blaring in the background. She came to take drink orders I ordered milk off the menu for my son she informed us milk was a breakfast only item. So he had to take a water. I ordered a coffee, asked if I wanted creamer, it came with a light splash of creamer and no spoon, and had been reheated in the microwave.

Bathroom did not have paper towels.
We ordered the Pulled Pork Sandwiches for the adults the kids each got a side, since there wasn't a kids menu, or kid friendly items on the dinner menu. The sides were Mac n Cheese, & a side salad with ranch. 

The food came quickly. The pulled pork was moist and well seasoned. The sauce was a touch spicy for my taste and reminiscent of Manwich sauce. It was served on a small toasted bun, with a side if coleslaw. The coleslaw was the star of the plate the cabbage was crunchy, the sauce was perfectly tangy without too much vinegar, it was simply perfect. 
The side of Mac had been reheated in a microwave, crumb topping was stale and pasta stuck together and was dry and hard on edges. Side salad was fresh it consisted of iceberg lettuce and purple cabbage. 

The bill was $29 and change for two entrees, two sides, a coffee, lemonade, and 2 waters. We paid with $40, she brought back a $10 and change. Service was no where near deserving of a 30% tip so rather than getting a few dollars we had planned on, with only large bills in our pockets we decided not to leave any.

Half way through meal another family walked in and the owners demeanor remained the same. Very disappointing.

Summary:
*inconsistent food quality
*horrible service, owner and son both very unhappy people.
*no refills offered or served after requesting refill."}
{"text":"I hate to say anything negative about a small family owned business but I was really disappointed by this place.  It wasn't horrible, but it seemed to be from a kit with a bit of spice on top.  For what I received it was expensive, took far too long to prepare and honestly, I thought the restaurant was dirty.

I hope they get their act together as many folks in the area love soul food and we want to see everyone succeed.  Sadly, until the food improves and the joint gets a scrubbing, I'll be eating somewhere else."}
{"text":"Must say, I was looking forward to try this place when I first passed by it.  It is located in downtown Glendale.  It's a little house serving soul food.  I love eating soul food, but now I have to be more cautious when eating it.  I had ordered the shrimp po-boy sandwich, which I got really sick after eating due to the shrimp undercooked (WARNING, IF THE SHRIMP LOOKED AND TASTED RAW, ITS DEFINITELY NOT DONE, AND IT IS NOT THE MARINATE!).  The reason I didn't return my dish was that we're the only table and waited a while for our foods to come. My friend had the Chicken Fried Steak, which was delicious.  Corn bread was good, chicken and waffle was just ok.  Lolo's is still better.  The owner was really nice, but unfortunately food poisoning wasn't pleasant at all."}
{"text":"Excellent Soul Food & Souther Hospitality!  
Michelle was a perfect host while we dined on the patio.  It's been a while since we visited but we were on vacation in Arizona and decided to try someplace intriguing.  
We weren't sure at first look, but the warm welcome and then the delicious catfish and fried chicken told us we'd made an excellent choice!  The dessert was out of the this world too..Mother Tennessee Soda Cakes!  I can't wait until our next visit to Glendale, AZ to visit our favorite Southern food friends."}
