{"text":"Ok...I admit I didn't have dinner here... but I'm feeling this place is more of a drink place regardless.  Come later and relax. Gorgeous, gorgeous space!  Dark and luxurious.  Cool crowd.  Not too crowded or try-hard.  Places to sit, stand, dance.  Music's good...not too loud or club-like.  Easy place to bring friends for original drinks and chats.  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I've been to Ame twice now and both experiences rank in the top 5 culinary highlights of my life. On both occasions the food has blown me away. We had great service from knowledgeable friendly staff. The decor is amazing and interesting and even the smallest of details are attended to.   We had Spicy Dungeness Crab sushi, Oyster mushroom tempura, Ebi Prawn with Lime Miso off the Robata grill and Black Cod Miso. Every dish was amazing. I can't stress it enough. Wonderful flavours, wonderfully prepared and presented, from wonderful staff.  I'm so sad for the people who gave it 2 or 3 stars. I can't understand how that could possibly be."}
{"text":"I was first @ this location when it was Rain, very cold and damp then, the decor has changed and is very warm and romantic. Personally loving the presentation of my plate, I would recommend this joint both for the food and surroundings. I was unaware it was a supper club, but pleasantly surprized to hear some jazzy house beats after our meal. :)    also be sure to check out Maison, the club next door if u are also a fan of some good old house beats ... The crowd was well dressed and all the women were gorgeous."}
{"text":"With its jaw-dropping Kill Bill interior, stylized primo tableware, and good-looking staff, this sexy Japanese fusion newcomer is like a Lamborghini Countach, till you taste the food and realize it has a Chevy engine.  I met Yelpers Christine C. and Deanna W., and her non-Yelper friend for pre-dinner drinks in the bar. The signature cocktails* ($14) are ambitious: bacon-infused gin in one, spicy Korean kochujang along with cilantro in another, two types of seaweed in mine. These libations explode with foodie-fave ingredients and are not for the apple martini set.  We then moved on to the robata bar for our dinner. We got comp edamame sprinkled with schmancy, delicious Japanese sea salt. We decided to share four tapas:  Dungeness crab maki ($11)* pork belly tonkatsu ($15)* duck breast in Japanese curry ($21)* miso black cod ($20)*  Most of the dishes suffered from overcomplicated-fication; too many competing flavors yielding wannabe-Nobu dishes on a bad acid trip.  The standout of the night was the pork which wasn't crusted in panko crumbs like a true tonkatsu but came garnished with thin strips of addictive miso bacon.   Our cute newbie waiter, though well-meaning and eager, was not well-versed in the menu and therefore couldn't make informed recommendations on the food or sake. Not cool for a restaurant charging these prices.  We each finished off our meal with thimblefuls of ramen* ($10). I know the Japanese have a tradition of eating till just 80% full but this was ridiculous--barely edging past 60 on the fullness scale. Just as well, since the broth wasn't deep enough and the noodles lacked the chewy springiness that I look for in ramen noodles.  I'd probably go back for a cocktail, to soak up the ambiance, and tinkle in the cool washrooms (that have the nice paper towels I like), but I generally prefer more substance and less style when it comes to my  food.  *See photos"}
{"text":"I dined at Ame last month as part of an epic 'five dinners in seven hours' food safari around Toronto. Ame, which means 'rain' in Japanese, is a swanky restaurant owned and operated by brothers/restauranteurs Guy and Michael Rubino. As soon as I walk through the imposing solid oak entrance doors, I feel as though I've been transported to the Land of the Rising Sun. Plush dining banquettes covered in Japanese silk kimono prints are contrasted with patterned wooden screens and polished concrete floors. Even the table settings exhibit an extraordinary level of thought. Chopsticks, which rest on grey pebbles, are held together by a small sticker emblazoned with the Japanese Kanji character for 'rain.' The space is warm, striking and is full of nice, little touches, I instantly feel at ease.  We proceed to order just two dishes - the Miso Black Cod and the Kanzani Miso Butter Fish - and although I'm not even that hungry, my tastebuds begin to salivate when I find out our latter dish will be cooked on the restaurant's infamous Robata Grill that was custom built and shipped specifically from Japan. The first of our two entrees arrive and it's the Miso Black Cod. The fish is presented on a sizzling hot plate with a handful of wakame and a sliver of crispy skin. The presentation may be simple but the flavors are bang on target. The fish is cooked to perfection and is so succulent, it simply melts in your mouth. The subtle miso glaze also works to enhance the flavor of the mild-tasting fish, rather than overpower it. It's a fine line between failure and success but the kitchen manages to strike a balance while demonstrating restraint and refinement. I would question the use of the wakame as a garnish, but the dish is executed so brilliantly, it's merely a minor blip.  Our highly-anticipated Kanzani Miso Butter Fish follows and I'm taken aback by the unorthodox plating. A gigantic wafer-thin crisp disc basically covers the entire plate and only upon moving it, do you discover the real delights of the dish - four perfectly cooked slices of butter fish surrounded by mushrooms, cucumber and black sesame seeds. The fish boasts a wonderful charcoal flavor and tastes great refreshing brunoised cucumber. The miso glaze is also justifiably far more robust and intense in this dish, which really compliments the natural sweetness of the fish.

{"text":"Honestly, the decor and ambiance at Ame are amazing. The way the place is done up is absolutely beautiful - just going there is an experience in of itself.  The food was absolutely superb. They told us when we ordered that every dish in the restaurant is intended to be shared amongst a group of people, that was good because we all wanted to try each other's food! We actually went there because a bunch of us had been at an event together and had gotten $50 gift certificates (each) for Ame so we wanted to all try it out together. We had told them beforehand that we had these gift certificates and they still treated us like royalty!  Everything we tried was delectable. I would like to say that I remember every single dish we had but I do not.   What I do recall specifically is that our server Drew was the paragon of customer service.   There was 8 of us and they treated us like royalty. We ordered a 36 piece dish and Drew (or maybe it was the kitchen or Manager at Ame but I am going to give Drew the credit) brought out 48 pieces for us just because.   Other things I remember we got was squash tempura which was, for lack of a better superlative, OMG! As well, a meat dish really taught me what the phrase 'like butter' means. It literally fell apart in my mouth.  At the end of our meal, Drew who had told us to save room for desert told us desert was on him! And then he brought out some awesometastic desert dishes (3 sets of 2) for our tables."}
{"text":"Ame is one of my top picks to have a unique dining experience.  Ame is quite frankly a food lovers spot, no doubt.  Owners Guy and Michael Rubino are dead serious about your dining experience.  I read many reviews complaining about everything from the DJ to the portions at Ame and even going back to their days operating their last restaurant, Rain.  There will always be something to criticize at their level but I will tell you without a doubt that the Rubino brothers are synonymous with innovative cuisine, quality, flavor and experience.   The restaurant doubles as a hipster hotspot, providing a late night resto-lounge.  There are tons of club reviews that attempt food commentary.  Be wary of those.  I visited initially as it is one of the few high quality food options open late.     The restaurant's decor is impressive boasting wood finishes throughout and even a whole massive tree trunk carved into their bar.  Nice touch Rubinos.    So what about the food and drink?  Well first Ame has a deep wine list and a deep sake list.  I did not take pictures of the drinks but Michael Rubino has crafted a large unique custom drink menu.  It is worth the trip just to drink.  We ordered, amongst other things a 750 ml Junmai Daigingo sake.  I wanted everything so I asked Guy to prepare an Omakase or chefs tasting menu and he graciously obliged.  First was the snapper sashimi.  Tuna sashimi with condiments Ika (Squid) sashimi Nigiri Plate Deep fried fish maki.   Assorted house made Japanese pickles.  This was one of the most promising offerings as each pickled vegetable was unique and exploded with flavor. Pulled Waygu short rib Some insane deserts"}
{"text":"'Ame' is the Japanese word for 'rain', so it follows that Ame is the traditional Japanese version of the now-closed Japanese fusion restaurant Rain.  I was taken here last night, on the second day of the restaurant being in business, and I should qualify my review by saying that I had never been to Rain but also that I rarely get to sleek King Street hot spots.  I suppose the decor shouldn't be the first thing I mention in a review but... wow, the decor! Elements of Japanese style like mon seals, brocade, daruma dolls, kimono printed glass and lattice walls made the space really exotic and atmospheric.   We sat at the bar, so I didn't have the full sit-down meal experience. I did do a tour around the restaurant first and saw the private dining room, the fancy Robata grill imported from Japan and the sushi chefs all lined up, knives gleaming, waiting for the dinner orders to start. Everything looked impeccable.   The cocktails are really different from the standard: I had a Gin-sing martini, which contained gin, ginseng, ginger and vanilla foam, garnished with edible flowers. Sounds weird but it was so good. Apparently the drink menu was devised by a Bar Chef bartender. I watched the bar staff create some very interesting mixes indeed:  the cocktails are each $14 but for once, I think the price suits the amount of innovation and effort involved. The highballs are served on a large globe of ice, which I haven't seen done anywhere outside of Japan. We also had shots of sake ($6 to $8) - I love my cold, milky Nigori! I think Ame is going to be a very good spot for a posh drink or two, even if not for a whole meal.  The food menu is not extensive. There are about five or six items in each of nine menu categories. Since we were just having a snack at the bar, I didn't try any of the entree-sized dishes. First, we had the scallop sashimi ($12). What we got was beautifully presented but it was not what was expected. The scallops were tossed in a sesame cream with wakame. I had been craving the cool cleanness of straight-up sashimi. So... the lesson here is that the sashimi dishes are not regular slices of fish on a plate - they are more complicated dishes which incorporate sashimi. Next, we tried the kabocha tempura ($10). It was served on a bed of nails and it was absolutely the best tempura I've ever had.   I intend to get back to Ame soon to try the duck curry and the unagi ramen, along with a couple more of those unique cocktails."}
{"text":"Ame is achingly beautiful but ultimately does not have the food to back up its gorgeous facade. The space is dark, industrial and accented with vibrant hues and waterfalls in the bar/lounge area. Really, you could take your best outfit, make up to town here and feel like a glamourpuss. Unfortunately, you'll have to contend with sub-par food and chintzy portions. The FARC's plus one guest set out here this week after being inspired by recent reviews about the reinvention of Rain. If you're an cocktail enthusiast you'll be pleased as punch here, their creations are original, packed with personality and share a hard asian influence. We received top notch service from Moses the bartender, who answered our queries with enthusiasm and expertise.   Moving onto the food, this is where things fell short for Ame. We take front row seats at their impressive Robata bar but the chefs manning the station are solemn soldiers engrossed in their work. We'll have to take our cues from our affable waiter instead. But there's something seriously amiss when he cops to not having tried any of the dishes. Wow. You'd think in a restaurant of Ame's stature and price, the staff would have thorough knowledge of what rocks and stinks on the menu. Memo to mgmt: feed the staff! That being said, our earnest and charming waiter took great care of us, was omnipresent throughout the meal filling water glasses, removing plates and answering what questions he could. We ordered crab maki, duck breast with curry, tonkatsu pork belly and miso black cod. Crab maki was bland and the pineapple sauce did nothing to enhance the crab flavor. The duck breast was cooked perfectly tender and juicy but it really lacked any flavour or punch! Miso black cod came in an unusual presentation, a hunk of fish over a sizzling plate but was reasonably tasty. The mop of seaweed on top of it distracted from the flavours and was an odd addition. The one item which we all really enjoyed was the pork belly, this belongs in the pork belly hall of fame for it was rich, crispy and savoury. Big time umaminess! As it was we were still feeling a little hungry after the entrees so we finished off with bowls of ramen that were rather bland, the broth lacking any real depth.   The drinks and the decor were the real standouts at Ame, I'd be interested in coming back for their ever changing and well-thought out cocktail list. The food however is a different story. It's too gussied up without any backbone or bite."}
{"text":"if you're looking for a beautiful space, and food with beautiful presentation, and to spend a lot of money, this is the place.   The food was good, but I felt not for the price I paid.  I loved the food shots that I got, but it wasn't worth the hefty price tag.   I love the miso fish. Everything else was good, but nothing stood out in my mind.  Check out my pics!"}
{"text":"My first visit was more then impressed.. great food great service, great cocktail, and of course their decore!!!!   well, second time around not so much..  my server was so-so, food, i already tried and been wowed.. and what really pissed me off was the Russian floor manager,! we have sent back vodka soda since it didn't taste like vodka soda, and she came back with huge attitude and told me we needed to talk(wtf?? who the hell is she anyways??), and that what she is giving me is premium Russian Vodka and i can choose to try it or not!  BOO HOO, never going back!"}
{"text":"Ame is more performance art than a restaurant.   One of the most spectacularly designed restaurants in all of Toronto; Ame is a feast for the eyes. From the beautiful bar area to the unbelievable private dining room, Ame's décor is something to behold. Unfortunately, there seems to be a major disconnect between the design and the delivery. In other words, the food fails to impress.  I have to say that our party did give it a good shot at enjoying dinner and ordered almost everything on the menu. It was a good thing did too. Be warned, the portions at Ame are obviously meant for children! No average adult could possible be satisfied with the prospect of sharing a dish when their share is no more than a mouthful. Here is what we ordered:  - Spicy tuna roll - average at best - Spicy king crab roll - at last minute addition but by far the best roll we had - Watercress with yuzu and toasted pine nuts salad - I had one bite of this....way too small - Tonkatsu pork belly - by far and away the BEST dish we had!!! - Saikyo lobster tail - not very good at all - Wagyu flatiron - boring...... - Japanese curry duck breast with mango - Ok...when compared to the other dishes we ordered - Shrimp tempura - served on a bed of nails which was pretty cool...but otherwise pretty average - Oyster  mushroom tempura - same as above - Liquid chocolate - apparently the house specialty...not very special   I could go on...but I think you get the point.  Oh yeah...before I forget, the wait staff really need to lighten up. Ame needs to hire less out of work method actors and more humans. It's just food people. Really, who give a shit that the tempura is made with mineral water. What I want to know is what's good and what I should take a pass on!   The one shinning light that almost saves Ame is the bartender, Moses. Christine C. hits the nail on the head in her review. How is it that it is a guy named Moses is this Japanese restaurant's saviour? This guy definitely has the chops. Not only is he a modest entertainer of the drinking arts, he has come up with some amazingly unique cocktails. I tried the Hot and Sour. The ingredients sound gross...but the end product is killer!  Overall, I would recommend eating at Ame once...just to say you did."}
{"text":"At these prices, I'd expect more in freshness, flavour, originality, and portion size from the food. Everything here was as expected and nothing impressed me more than the ordinary. At Ame, you're basically paying for the hip ambiance. The best part of the meal was actually the dessert - very original menu (ever changing), lots of flavors and textures to try. At a certain time in the night, a DJ starts mixing and then it gets hard to hear yourself and carry a conversation."}
{"text":"Two & a half stars.    How is it that it is a guy named Moses who is the saviour in a Japanese restaurant?   The one bright spot in the oh so cavernous restaurant Ame is a bartender who really knows his stuff when it comes to mixology.  Moses, you can part the Red Sea and I'd follow you any day of the week as long as you have one of those fab-u-lous-oh cocktails in hand.  I'm a cocktail contessa and I know my stuff and this boy really brings the A game to the bar.  That is where the goodness of Ame ends.  If the owners were smart they turn the front part of Ame into a much more comfortable sitting area and let Moses turn up the heat.    The FARC's and a new guest were on the loose last night on the heels of Andrea's review and we were pumped.  Talk about all sizzle and no steak.  All flash and no dazzle.  For me, Ame has the depth of a postage stamp.  We sidled up to the Robata bar where the guys behind there could take a cue from Moses and at least interact, talk, smile or wink at us.  It was like we weren't even there.  Our waiter, bless his sweet soul, was on his first shift and really knew nothing of the menu.  When Susan questioned him he confessed (I'll give him props for his honesty) that he hadn't even tasted any of the dishes.  Big, big, big faux pas by the management.  Feed your staff fools!  They are your best sales people and asset to your bottom line.    Anyway, we ordered up some plates to share;  (see Susan's run down) and in the end the only thing that had a wow factor to it was the pork belly with the miso bacon.  Everything else was \"meh\".  For the price tags, this was in my opinion, a disappointment.  The miso cod didn't need to have a pile of soggy, grey looking seaweed dropped on top.  The crab was playing hide and seek in the maki.   And the duck, which initially had my mouth watering when reading the menu (curry & mango salsa), looked pretty, much like the restaurant, but had no attitude.  Cubed up melon does not a fruit salsa make.  They needed to add something emulsified to tie it all together.   However, like the restaurant, the plates looked pretty.  Lots of zig zags, dots and dribbles.    We all ordered up Ramen to finish up because we were still hungry and I have to say that my Grandmother had thimbles bigger than these bowls.  There was a raw egg yolk in the bowl which I removed.  It was suggested to me that it would cook inside the broth, which it would have, except there was barely enough broth to cover the noodles, so I took it out.  Raw eggs don't do it for me.    We passed on dessert.  WTF is up with that dessert menu anyway?  There were four things listed on it....said something like....Liquid Chocolate....Apricots and Honey....so on....how is this a dessert menu?  The bill for those small plates, a mid priced bottle of wine, a glass of Sake for Susan and the Ramen was $255 bucks (before tip).    Would I go back?  Moses the bartender told me that they'll be changing up the cocktail menu every few months.  For that I'd venture in.  For food....I think not."}
{"text":"Enter. Be really impressed by what the restaurant looks like inside. Be seated. Review the menu. Ask the servers what will be good for your tastes. They will astound you with awesome presentation, aroma and taste. Let the server select a wine for you... or let them pick glasses of wine that are appropriate. By all means enjoy a dessert.  Interact with the servers. Have fun. You will have a great time and enjoy food that is uniquely of the Rubino's creation. We have had a great time at Zoom, Rain and AME as the Rubino brothers change your opinion of Japanese restaurants.  It is not rocket science, but the food is really innovative and delicious.  I hope you enjoy it as much as we did."}
{"text":"It has a great ambience and perfect for drinks after a dinner out somewhere with great music by the the DJ. However, my friends inside had to come and get the host to tell the bouncer to let us in. There was no lineup outside and I was with 3 other friends, and the bouncer claimed that they were at capacity. We waited a bit outside, then he allowed 2 girls in no problem. I kindly asked why he let them in and not us, he replied, who are you? this is not some 2nd rate club. Whatever that means I dont know.  We had a friend inside with a table and bottles. I commonly frequent clubs that are guest list only i.e. 1812, however, never have I been spoken to in such a disrespectful way by a bouncer. Once we got inside there were maybe 10 people.   The stuck up attitude by the staff turned me off from the idea of returning, they think the venue is something that it is not. Wouldn't go for the food you can tell it would be overpriced. However, feeling inside is very cool."}
{"text":"Last Friday was my friend's birthday -- she chose the restaurant \"AME\" and so we trotted along our merry way there.  When I was trying to find this place, I got a little bit confused as there were these huge doors that I had to enter through.  You walk in, and it's like you're brought into this new world.  Ambiance was great.  It's like a little chic supper club; around 10 PM - it becomes a lounge where the DJ comes out to play some great beats -- however, not so loud enough that you can't hear what everybody else is saying.  AME is defintely a place that you need to go with a bunch of friends just to be able to try the different plates of food that they have.   We ordered quite an amount of food: 1) MISO BLACK COD:  One word - deliciousness.  Although presentation was simple and lacking compared to the rest of their dishes - I was so impressed by the taste, texture - EVERYTHING.  It is a definite recommend. 2) SQUASH TEMPURA:  The presentation was different than your usual Asian tempura bento box.  They placed each of the tempura squash on a nail.  Presentation was spectacular, squash tempura was spectacular. 3) WATERCRESS SALAD:  I wish I was able to try this, however, my friend was unwilling to share. 4) SUSHI MAKI:  Truth be told, I feel like I've had better sushi at other places, but the WASABI was amazing (... really?).  I'm not kidding.  I believe they grated their own horse-radish.  It was quite a treat. 5) TSUME GLAZED TUNA KABAYAKI: I found this dish to be okay.  The fish was seared well on the outside. 6) WAGYU RICE:  So I was a bit skeptical to be purchasing RICE for a price at this restaurant; however, it was totally worth it.  I'm not sure what exactly they had incorporated in the rice, but it was flavourful. 7) KINZANO MISO BUTTER FISH:  Off their famous Robata Grill, the butter fish was grilled to medium rare and was hidden under a shrimp cracker.  It was like finding a pearl in a clam.  However, I would still recommen the miso black cod more. 8) DUCK BREAST:  wasn't a very memorable dish. 9) PORK: cooked with a bit of spice, my friends had absolutely loved it.  I think they may have hyped it up too much for me, and it was okay.  DESSERTS:  The menu is hilariously cryptic.  Literally just telling you what the flavours are and not explaining to you what they really were (does this include ice cream? cake? cookies? what is it!)  Our waiter, Michael, did an amazing job of selling us the desserts.  We bought all of them.  I can't recall every single one, but I would definitely recommend the lemon & sesame one (that might  be because I'm not a huge fan of chocolate desserts).  Each dessert was soooo flavourful - we were all dying with excitement.  However, our night wouldn't have been so amazing if it wasn't fror our waiter, Michael.  He certainly knew his food and described each of the dishes with such perfection.  When he was describing the desserts to us, I felt like I as going to cry because they just sounded just THAT delicious.  He always checked up on us, and had a smiling face.  I would definitely recommend AME to those who want to sit back and relax and perhaps splurge a little on some excellent dishes.  Will definitely visit again!"}

{"text":"Ducked in on a Saturday night after dinner because it was pouring rain and my friends and I were looking for a place to sit down and have a drink/maybe dance.  - Stunning interior, very dark and elegant - Lots of cougars and old men (I think both groups were disappointed) - No cover  - $3 coat check - $8 for mixed drinks - Around 11pm they move some of the tables to clear space for dancing - Pretty much ALL euro-house and the DJ actually ignored me when I tried to request a song We weren't really feelin' it and left once the rain stopped."}
{"text":"This was my favourite place in TO but it closed to become Buonanotte which is also good but not as clubby. I miss AME"}
{"text":"Ame is so hip, it hurts.   Through its massive oak doors, you enter into a dark, dungeon-like dining hall -- quite intriguing, given the venue's fascinating past as Toronto's first women's prison. The decor is reflective of the Japanese fusion Ame lays claim to - kimono fabrics blend in with stylish, contemporary furnishings, and eccentric light fixtures featuring (what looks like) handwritten notes, hang beside their exposed lightbulb counterparts. It's heavy-duty industrial and sexy as hell.  The menu was impressive and the sushi platter we started off with was quite noticeably fresh and delicious. The mains followed suit, and my choice of Sweet and Sour Miso Lamb Chops was cooked to perfection.  In true fine-dining style, however, we all felt the portions were far too small, which is surprising given how much the restaurant encourages sharing meals. We had to take our server's advice and order a few extra sides (my Shrimp Tempura's arrival on a slab of nails brought out a few envious glances from my dining partners).  Desserts were divine, and at this point, I have to complement our server whose eloquent description of what \"Pear and Milk Chocolate\" comprised of, was like erotica for gourmands.   I may not necessarily return for the expensive, small-portioned menu, but with its ultra-cool ambiance, Ame is definitely a great place to start off or end a night on the town."}
{"text":"OK - I give it a 3/5 for an overall dining experience ... but if your expectations are (more appropriately) set to popping in for a couple of drinks, some people watching and/or socializing ... as ONE stop on an evening out on the town - I'd go as high as 4.5/5.  Just don't even bother eating.    The drinks in the $8-15 range isn't too much of a bother ... but the value for money in the food department left me frustrated, and a quick hundred bucks poorer (just sushi, sashimi, apps for 2).  There was a CD release party going on there last night, so the music got a bit louder than I'd noticed it on previous visits.  In summary:  - food  7.5/10 - style and decor:  9.5/10 - ambiance and vibe: 9.5/10  - cleanliness & presentation: 8/10 - service & timing: 6/10 - value for money: 4/10 - company (as in the people you're with companions) and conversation: 9/10 :) ... (I am yet to ever give a 10/10, but it will mark a very special day lol)"}
{"text":"I came here for an Asian party, but wasn't too impressed with the venue or the crowd.  I'm not sure how the place is as a restaurant, but I'm not really tempted to try it."}
