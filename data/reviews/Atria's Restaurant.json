{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Beautiful bar and restaurant. We had a party of four I ordered my meal and our server was courteous and knowledgable about the menu. Ten minutes later she came back to tell me they were out the the dish I ordered. I understand they run out of items at times. But the time that lapsed was too long. I was uncomfortable and ordered something quickly that I probably would not have chosen under normal circumstances because we had somewhere to be and I didn't want to waste time.  Otherwise it was good. I would recommend it. However this small incident changed it to a 4 star."}
{"text":"Got their smoked meat combo. Ribs and brisket. Ribs were good. Cole slaw average. Brisket. Knew I was in trouble when it came out cut WITH the grain. Allegedly they smoke it for 15 hours...my question is over what? Didn't taste ANY smoke flavor let alone seasoning. It was also rather dry. Service was good and the atmosphere can't be beat...just need to work on that smoker. Won't be coming back for brisket but maybe for something else."}
{"text":"What has happened to Atria!s  since I was there in the Fall? We had a table of ten for a birthday dinner. The back of our chairs had greasy fingerprints on them. I have no idea how customers would have greasy fingers but the chairs were disgusting, 
I hate dirty menus. Each of us had  a menu dotted with food. We had reservations for 5 and there only four other diners in the restaurant. Still, they were \"out\" of children's menus. We only needed one. My pan seared tilapia was dry and tasteless. It needed seasoning of some kind. The spinach needed butter and seasoning as well. Another diner at our table said the chicken fra diablo was decent. when we left,the restaurant and bar were packed and it was a Thursday evening, I may be one of the very few who was disappointed in Atria's For goodness sakes, wash your chairs and your menus at the very least."}
{"text":"Wow, I can't say enough about the valet attendant Dustin. A true \"go-getter\". A handsome, welcoming smile every day."}
{"text":"I've been to Atria's in the past and expected much more from my recent visit.  I didn't have a choice in this matter - we were scheduled to meet a friend for drinks and dinner before the game.  Our friend got there first and put her name in.  She was told 1:30 wait for a table.  As we drove into the city and parked the car we hoped we'd get there just as our name was called.  Yes, I'd expect to wait for a table on a busy night and yes, I agree that the early bird gets the worm, but once seated I have a few expectations...

We were seated on the patio outside the restaurant.  No silverware, no napkins, no water...when the waitress asked what we'd like to drink so we tried to keep it simple - Yuengling on tap - and she said, \"no, we're out\".  

The wait for food was over an hour.  Many folks around us were complaining.  I can see that.  On one hand you feel like you have to have patience because it is a game night.  On the other hand you have to realize that this restaurant is in this location because of baseball.  It seemed like the servers and management staff were scared.  You could smell the fear in the air.  They scurried about and didn't make eye contact.  One bus boy brought out a bread basket for a family with little kids.  Finally, our food arrived.  2/3 plates came out.  Of those 2 one was wrong.  The final dish came out.  Then the reworked second dish came out.  Nothing was stellar, nothing was even good.  My fish sandwich had a cold, stale bun.  My fries were limp.  The chopped salad looked slimy.  The Fra Diablo looked good but was a ginormous portion.

It just seemed like Atria's couldn't hand it.  And I think to myself - everyone knows how popular the Pirates are this year.  Atria's is in PNC Park, obviously they have to know how big a game will be based on ticket pre-sales.  Staff up? Take out some tables if your kitchen can't handle it?  Reduce your menus to reflect only a handful of items that can be produced in a manner that reflects your corporate quality standards, and those that can be produced in a timely manner?  By location alone this restaurant has the ability to wow the masses...and they failed."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place. We often go for date night and sit at the bar. Bartenders are great. Friendly casual place to hang. We also often come for special occasions with a larger group and they are also very accommodating - sweet to our children, quick to refill drinks and kind to those in our parties who prefer the first floor. As for the food nearly everything we have had is great. Burger is amazing! Pot roast nachos - can't go wrong! Crab Bisque is delicious. And if you have a chance to go for Octoberfest the Bavarian Cheese Soup & Pretzels are a MUST try. Great local spot. Love, love love!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and atmosphere, and right in the heart of Pittsburgh right at the foot of the baseball stadium. Will definitely hit up the next time in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"I was recommended by a regular there. So i went for lunch on a Tuesday. The hostess seemed to be very fake and unprofessional. She was older and had a very high pitched voice. I sat in the bar, the bartender was absolutely great! The hostess was going around the bar kissing all the men there. I didn't think it was very professional. The food was good, but it was cold and the fries seemed to be soggy. I was in a hurry to get back to work so I didn't mention the food to anyone. I ate and left. I wouldn't go back just because of the hostess, she made me feel very uncomfortable. The service was quick and polite."}
{"text":"Attended a business early dinner meeting at Atria's last week.  Valet parking was a nice touch, arrived early so I sat at the bar with a few others and had a drink before the meeting.  Sangria was really good.  Bartender was very friendly.  Once we were seated upstairs we were greeted by the Manager then introduced to the waiter.  They were very accommodating.  Allowing us to order at 4:00 then bring our food hot and ready at 5:00.  I ordered the Salmon and it was very good.  Nice size portion with jasmine rice.  Well seasoned and cooked perfectly.  The others all commented that they enjoyed their food too.  The chef came out to see if we were happy and talked for a few minutes about the food.  Very nice touch.  First time I was ever at this location, they told me it is the original.  I liked it very much and would definitely return."}
{"text":"I love their food but they are a little punished by their own success.   The service is normally rushed due to crowds and the food is inconsistent.   One day it is knock your socks off great and other times you just want to order another drink and skip your meal.   Its in a good location and gets a good crowd.  Dispite the flaws I totally recomend this place."}
{"text":"The Crux: 
Between a \"Meh\" and \"A-OK\" for basic American fare lunch w/ some pasta additions and other dishes(http://www.atrias.com/4748_Winter_Warm_Lunch_2010.pdf) . Medium size portions for lunch but a bit pricey. Made a boo-boo in choice but would consider re-visit for a more standard fare dish. 

The Order: 
Since it was the first time thought I'd be better off goin' for one of their Winter Time Favorites. So thought would be adventurous. 

Buffalo Shrimp Wrap - pico de gallo, blue cheese, lettuce and fresh cut fries - $9.99 

BF got the Fish & Chips - beer battered cod w/ coleslaw & fresh cut fries - $8.99 

Food Likes: 
* Fish - 2 med. pieces; really really crispy & not overly oily; served w/ tarter & cocktail sauce; BF really loved 
* Fries - tasty and crisp 
* Bread - fresh and good served while waiting 

Food No Likie So Much: 
* Buffalo Shrimp Wrap - It was way too spicy for my taste. And I don't think it was the pico de gallo (couldn't really tell if there was any) but the buffalo sauce on the shrimp just was overly tangy and spicy. 
But I suppose getting \"buffalo\" sauce it should've clicked in my idiotic head \"Warning - Spicy Eat At Your Own Risk\"
Also, didn't seem like that much shrimp maybe 2 cut per half tinted orange flour tortilla wrap. 

* Coleslaw - it was okay..needed some salt & pepper and a bit too watery 

Service: 
Sat at a table top near the bar and service was great!"}
{"text":"I went back to Atria's hoping to get a salmon dish that I have had in the past.  They no longer have it.  The server made a suggestion, that was similar.  it was good, not great.  Just slightly disappointed that the menu changed.  Some places are able to still make past dishes.  I asked, they could not do it."}
{"text":"I don't like to leave poor reviews, but this was WAY too salty...everything we ordered from the pot roast, brisket, filet mignon, Macaroni and cheese, and potato cakes. We couldn't even eat it, and left hungry. Frankly...the food was disgusting, dry, and overcooked. We didn't complain, though. 

Our waitress, Emma, was nice."}
{"text":"Mr brother and I stopped there at noon on a weekday to take my mother out to lunch.  We enjoyed the outdoor seating area with umbrellas.  Service was excellent.  We ordered the wedding soup and grilled salmon salads.  The soup was excellent, flavorful with lots of big chicken chunks. The salmon was thin and freshly grilled which gave the outside a delightful crispness from the grill marks.  The fresh poppyseed dressing nicely complemented the freshly made salad.  Generous portions at reasonable prices. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I love the chopped salads so much that sometimes I will drive to Murrysville just to get a chopped salad to go. They even include some bread & butter with the salad to go. I have even been known to cook dinner & still use this in place of normal salad. Lots of veggies with a nice, light vinaigrette.
 Oh, the food is consistently great, too, as is the service! But there's just something special about those chopped salads..."}
{"text":"Fabulous dinner! I got the crab cakes which were 99.9% crab. Almost no filling, mayo, etc it was all about that crab; like a crab cake should be. I've lived in Maryland and I've had some amazing crab cakes. Atrias were hands down the best I've had in a while, if not ever! The chicken Marsala, ribs and tilapia were great as well (that's what others in my party had). To top it off we had the largest piece of carrot cake I've ever seen! It literally came out in a pasta bowl. The chef also delivered our meal, and came out again to check on us and all the tables to see how our meals were. They were packed too. When was the last time a chef asked you how your meal was?! What a great dining experience. So happy this place is right down the street. Well done Atrias and chef John!! Thanks again"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and man was it good. We got homemade chips as an app.. 2 thumbs up. That wasn't even the best part. I got a simple rotisserie chicken wrap but IT. WAS. AMAZING! I've been ranting about it ever since and have been dieing to try their dinner menu!"}
{"text":"Nice evening with the entire family
Steve( Gary) our server. Very attentive friendly and just an all around nice person 
Food was delicious."}
{"text":"Nice place for a date night, or dinner with friends. Semi formal setting. Their beef pot roast nachos are to  die for and their fillet mignon steaks are delicious."}
{"text":"A great place with great people who work there. The food is very good and always good drinking. I've been going there Since 2012 and some of the same folks still work there along with new faces. I always stop in to say and have a few drinks and a bite to eat. I would highly recommend this this place. You can't beat the location."}
{"text":"My prior review and experience was a 5 Star entry ... tonite 11/21/17 was a 1 Star.

Went for the Chicken Pot Pie Special tonight expecting the usual excellent pot pie. Our table of 4 all hot pot pies and they were all horrible.  They were all basically missing chicken and potatoes!!! Out of 4 pot pies we counted three pieces of chicken.  It was basically a creamy soup with peas in a pie crust!  Sooo disappointing...

They went from great to a total joke.

Additionally our waitress was inattentive and two of us sat with no ice tea refills for over half our meal.

Totally has shaken my faith in this restaurant.

Perhaps it is under new management ???

Got one pot pie to go and it was awful as well... see the picture .... deflated joke"}
{"text":"After living in the area for over a decade I think it is time for a review. I have eaten at Atria's over a dozen times. It is a very good locally owned restaurant. I would rather eat here than the chains. It is Octoberfest time of the year for their menu. Our party had crab cakes, Reuben, beer cheese soup and the kids had hamburgers. First of all the service was great on Sept 28, 2017. The appetizer pretzels were great too. In the end I would recommend Atria's if you are looking for a decent meal."}
{"text":"Pulling up looks great but we found a bug in our whiskey, the service was bad even though they tried really hard, and my salmon salad was made with romaine (very disappointed).The crab bisque was very good though. We got put in the back so felt like we were in an Applebee's trying to be a fancy restaurant."}
{"text":"Went before a baseball game with the kids. Limited menu. My husband asked the same server 3 times for a water, he never received. My Reuben tasted like eating a salt stick. Won't go back!"}
{"text":"I had an absolute terrible experience during Mother's Day here.

Their computers were down. We had reservations for 12 and did not get seated until 12:45.

Also, there selection for Mother's Day was a fraction of the typical menu. The chicken parm I had was bland and lackluster.

In the past I enjoyed this place, but I would never go back there on a holiday. Worst yet they did nothing to make up for the nearly 45 minute wait we had to endure when we had reservations 2 weeks in advance. Tip: don't take reservations if you can't RESERVE the space."}
{"text":"I have always eaten at atrias (since it opened). After my son was born and we found out he was very allergic to seafood we would only go to atrias  when he wasn't with us just to be safe. If you are a parent you know getting out of the house without children is far and few between. We went out to dinner at atrias with him recently, they were amazing. We let the waiter know of my child's allergy, they went out of their way to cook his food on separate cookware and prepared it completely separate from all the other food! Something you don't find now a days!!!!! Thank u!"}
{"text":"I came here with a party of 40 very hungry Pitt students. The food was amazing. We had roasted beef, chicken, and pasta. The management was lovely and really involved during any party issues. The staff was also very kind and able to keep everyone's glass full, despite our camel like drinking habits. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I went on a Tuesday evening, around 8pm, and sat on the patio.  The hostess was very accommodating with where we wanted to sit and we were seated immediately. 

Our service was implacable!! She was so friendly and attentive. 

Our food was great. We had the lobster bisque because I always get that, it's delicious. And I got the steak salad. Steak was cooked perfectly and I had all of the right amount of fixins'. While this may be a chain place, it is a great restaurant!"}
{"text":"Walking distance for me while in downtown Pittsburgh.Had  the steak for an entree and brownie for dessert.Steak was medium rare,just as it was ordered.Cold beer and live entertainment.I will definitely goo back to try other items on menu."}
{"text":"Went for the first time and will definitely be back. The stuffed shrimp with crab was delicious... No fillers finally!! Server did a great job also."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal at Atria's. The owners, Linda & Frank, are amazing. They are so welcoming and friendly. The McMurray location is usually pretty busy, which is a good sign. I'm happy to wait at this restaurant. I'm in love with everything from their appetizers to desserts. In fact, I get unusual cravings for their ranch dressing! Highly, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Bleh!

The food here is so bland. I ordered the Chicken Marsala and it was the worst I have had. The noodles seemed over cooked and mushy and the chicken looked really greasy. It tasted like it could have been made out of a box/power mix. Just not good. Also, the proportions are tiny!

The restaurant itself is small, but they seemed to have most of their tables set up for groups of about 6-7 people.

Eh, defiantly won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Very dissapointing meal compared ro orher times we've been there.  Started with hostess ignoring us completely while talking to a server.  Once we were seated, our server was attentative and came rather quickly after we were seated to get our drink order. Catfish appetizer was not cooked the whole way through and had to be sent back to be re-done. No apology from the manager that brought the 2nd one. And no offer to comp it.  Med-Rare filet I ordered as my meal was dry....quality of the meat seemed to be lacking. Overall, don't think I will be going back."}
{"text":"Came in 15 min to closing, starving and delirious. They were so nice to seat us and take our order quickly! We only got appetizers and sides BUT bruschetta and flat bread were good. The star was def the last minute side order of the smashed potatoes. Holy... Those were delicious! Get those if you find yourself eating there !"}
{"text":"Great service all the way from the valet Dustin to server Keegan! We had a group of ladies for a Saturday lunchtime baby shower. Attentive and courteous staff as well as delicious food - especially the crab bisque. They helped make our day special."}
{"text":"Average experience. The entrees that we chose (chicken marsala and chicken piccata) were fine but under seasoned. The cheese plate was the best part of the meal: four cheeses selected and served by Carole \"dear heart\" from Penn Mac. Exceptional choices, good crusty bread and she's lovely and a Pittsburgh institution. 

Service was spotty. I was there representing my company. We produced the music that evening. I'm not sure if the server assumed that we wouldn't be ordering food or what, but after we ordered the cheese course and wine, he came back only to attempt to take away our menus not to take our order. I had to ask to order entrees. It was just odd. I've heard similar things from others that have been there on our music nights."}
{"text":"This is one seriously overrated restaurant. On my last visit, I chose the least expensive entree on the menu, a pasta dish that cost approximately $11. It turned out to be a few handfuls of ziti with a few random veggies thrown in for color. 

Yeah, this is probably a good place to take someone you want to impress, because it's beautifully done on the interior, but clearly they're putting the money in the decor, not the food."}
{"text":"We make the trip from Chicago area to Mt Lebanon to visit family a couple times a year - and a visit isn't complete without some of Atrria's pot roast nachos ... just outstanding!  We have been there for dinner many times as well - and always well done."}
{"text":"My husband and I are Cubs fans and flew into Pittsburgh to see Friday and Saturday's Cubs-Pirates game this past weekend (7/7 & 8).  We got to PNC Park around 5 p.m. and since the gates weren't open we decided to sit and have some drinks before the game.  We stopped first at Atria's.  Although there was only one other table occupied outside, we were told if we weren't going to order food (just drink) we would have to give up our table if people, who were eating food needed it.  This was RIDICULOUS  to us so we left!  We were paying guests just like their other guests!!  Anyway we went a few businesses down and drank at Dominic's.  We went to Dominic's both nights and probably spent close to $100 AND did up getting FOOD.  Atria's better rethink how they treat guests...."}
{"text":"We came after we heard how amazing the pierogi was from Johnny (owner) himself.  We came super late and they had closed, but they opened the doors just for us.  (Party of three) The staff was extremely nice.   They were over the top and that's why I'm writing this review. The food was amazing. Definently worth the drive. Way to be good people. Keep being nice!"}
{"text":"Shame on us.

6:30 reservation. Gave the hostess our name  and she was immediately confused. It was evident that she had  already given our reservation away (as we could see the computer) but she didn't own up to it. 6:40, hostess says they're clearing tables upstairs for our space. Ok. 6:45, still waiting. Manager shows up. Says patrons just left on the lower floor and that he'll personally push tables together for our reservation. We agree. While standing outside I watched him clear one of these tables, work on getting the legs level for 30 seconds, and then abandon all hope. This was the last time that we saw the manager all night. No follow up later on. 6:55, watch two servers finish pushing the tables together and laying down the table dressing. 6:58, we're seated. No menus or silverware. Server comes out. Her name is Lynda. She immediately notices this and rectifies the problem. Lynda worked hard all night. She deserves a better working environment. 7:10, order taken. 7:45, apps show up over an hour from the initial reservation. 8:33, meal finally arrives 1.5 hours after the initial order was taken. The food is ok. It's warm and I've had worse, but I've also had a lot better at this same location a year ago. 8:53, paid the bill. No dessert as we would likely have had to spend the night. Total was $155 and my parents intended to pay as it was my birthday (plus they had a gift card). I insisted on paying in full. We compromised and I paid $105 after applying the gift card. Left $20 solely for Lynda. Hope she finds a better employer if she plans on staying in this line of service.

We won't be back. The kicker is that we'd had a near identical experience during the past Octoberfest. We thought that it was a fluke. Shame on us. Our general observation from watching the servers, manager, and patrons is that this place panders to regulars while ignoring customers that would otherwise repeat. What happens when the regulars are gone?

Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"This is me n mumz' second time here for Thanksgiving and they always make us feel like we've come home to family for the holidays.

Wonderful service and nice atmosphere for a holiday meal. Speaking of which, the food is like homemade too. The smells and football on the TV's makes u feel at home. Free Parking out front; not too shabby!"}
{"text":"Everything was amazing- food and service top notch! I had the scallops and my husband had the crab cakes. So delicious! Staff was fantastic and manager came out twice to make sure everything was good."}
{"text":"Had a very good experience here, prices were reasonable for being at stadium. Service was excellent and the smoked meat combo I had was great, with nice size portion"}
{"text":"The food is acceptable. They have a pretty wide range, but narrow the menu on Pirates game days. I tried the seared ahi tuna. It was good, but nothing memorable. The location appears to be the best thing about the place. Sitting outside on a warm evening, looking at the city skyline and seeing people walk around before a Pirates game is an interested dinner experience. But don't go for the menu."}
{"text":"This is more of a 3.5 star rating. I visited this restaurant with a large group of about 40 people before going to a show at the New Hazlett Theater. We were seated upstairs and ate a buffet-style dinner (the dishes had already been picked). The two waiters who took care of us were extremely friendly and efficient, and they made sure we would leave in time for our show. While we waited for the food to come out, they served us drinks, but the waiter stopped offering straws after the first couple tables.

When the food came out, they let a few tables help themselves at a time. They provided us with three different types of plates (large square ones, rectangular ones, and small circular ones), which I found odd. We had three entrees in the buffet line: Chicken Marsala, Tomato Vodka pasta, and Parmesan Crusted Tilapia.

Chicken Marsala: flavorful, tender chicken served with mashed potatoes. I really enjoyed the potatoes because they had a distinct potato flavor, unlike most butter-heavy ones. However, I wish they were more generous with the tomatoes and mushrooms in the dish. There was no vegetable-based dish in our entire meal, and I missed them.

Tomato Vodka pasta: penne cooked with just a little bite left in a yummy tomato sauce with a couple leaves of spinach here and there. Again, I wished there was a lot more spinach in the dish. Also, the pasta was a little sauce-heavy.

Parmesan Crusted Tilapia: the fish was crispy and delicious, the angelhair pasta was cooked perfectly, and the tomato sauce was good. I grabbed some pasta near the edge that hadn't been touched by sauce, so I liked the amount. No vegetables, though.

Afterwards, they brought out a tray of bite-size desserts for us. I don't see any of them on their menu, so I'm not sure how the organization ordered them. Both the cheesecake flavors I tried (raspberry and almond) were delicious--the cheesecake was really light and airy, and the flavors really came through without being overly sweet or overpowering. They also had strawberry halves and chocolate chip cookies, which were soft and cakey--not the best I've ever had, but pretty good. Also, there were these little squares that, as far as I could tell, were squares of iced cake covered in chocolate. These were way too sweet for my taste. Mine looked like chocolate everything, but there were also white-chocolate covered squares, and other squares with different colors inside (different flavors of icing, perhaps?).

Overall, I enjoyed the food, but I'd like to try a greater variety before giving four full stars (and see if there are any vegetable-heavy ones). However, this restaurant is a little too expensive for me to return any time soon. The service was great."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed. Service was slow, non-attentive, and invasive. The food quality did not match the ambience or the service. Recommend Olive Garden."}
{"text":"I am a fan for reasons beyond the food.  I love the bartenders here!  Great service.  Food is good.  Prices are reasonable.  Love the owner-he will make you feel incredibly welcome.  

Thursday nights are Cougar night... It is honestly quite entertaining...so if you are into people watching or are looking to hook up check it out.  If none of the above save you visit for a different day."}
{"text":"The Italian Wedding soup and the service was really good but my chicken Parmesan was pretty terrible.  My buddy got the half rack of ribs and ate every last one to his satisfaction.  We finished off lunch with hot fudge sundaes which were also fairly lackluster.  Will definitely be back as there are not too many places in Canonsburg to eat lunch."}
{"text":"Despite good tasting food and nice music to accompany dinner, Atria's suffers from very long wait times for every aspect of the meal. It took longer than average to even get attention to the table, as well as for drinks and food. Do not come here before your baseball/football game. You will most likely miss your game. The service quality was average, nothing to complain about, but nothing to write home about either. The delicious food and polite waitress did save the meal from being a total disaster though."}
{"text":"Have eaten here many times and have enjoyed the food while visiting my family. However, after this experience I will not be back. Only person of color in restaurant and bartender  has been inattentive and rude at the bar. Each time the bartender comes to me she always starts with \"I'll be with you, they were here first\". Did not catch her name (older blonde working on 12/22 @ 7:48 pm)  but requested a menu 15 minutes ago and she still had not taken my order. Changed mind about food and am leaving."}
{"text":"Amazing spot right next to PNC Park and near the river. I got a great salad but what stood out was the friendly waiters and servers. Prices are reasonable. I would highly recommend"}
{"text":"I love the salads here. Very healthy. Ahi tuna is my favorite. I will keep coming back for kore.  Keeep up the good work. Cant wait for baseball season to start so I can hang out even more. My boys will be hitting it up all Season long! Go Bucks!"}
{"text":"Place has been in the location for a long time. It is small so prepare for a close encounter with other tables. The food used to be great! They opened a few more locations and the food now seems a little more chain like. Definitely lost the local business hometown feel. Other then that the food could be a lot worse. The staff has always been friendly and always around when needed."}
{"text":"Would be a lot better if they had miller lite on draft.  Had the fra diablo which was supposed to be spicy but it was something that I would serve to a hospital patient recovering from stomach surgery."}
{"text":"What Happened!?!?!?! I loved this place and went last valentines day only to be given a completely new menu with foods I had no idea what were doing on an atria's menu. I love this place because its right in the ball park so it's nice to go in and know your inside the ball park enjoying a meal, but I was just completely thrown off when I went I couldn't even enjoy my time. There is plenty of space and it's quite cozy. Prices are kind of expensive for the food they offer."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here several times and have not had anything that wasn't delicious!!! Good service too!!!"}
{"text":"One star rating because a friend and I went to eat on a Sunday late lunch on a whim and wasn't dressed to their liking apparently.  We had shorts and tshirts on and not good enough to sit in the dining room apparently.  First thing the manager said to the hostess as well walked in was \"Patio.\"  Anyone would think that it's normal for him to say that since we were wearing summer gear during the summer but just how it was stated and the delivery of it just didn't feel right.  You never should judge by appearance,  like I said it was on a whim and my friend drives a convertible mercedes sl and I'm not doing too bad either."}
{"text":"Before a Pirates game we stopped in to get a bite. I ordered a hamburger with fries for $13.00. Very disappointed. It took over 30 minutes to get the order. The meat was very dry and falling apart but not over cooked. This tells me that they added \"filler\", usually bread, to stretch the meat and pump profits. I've had juicier meat and larger patty at Wendy's for a sixth of the price. Overall...I would not go back to Atria's."}
{"text":"So unbelievably disappointing. After living in Pittsburgh my entire life and never having been to Atria's, when my folks suggested we dine there, I was excited to make my pilgrimage. I'd heard so many good things about this place. Guys... Are you sure you meant THIS place? Our dinner was so painfully subpar that I finally registered as a Yelp user to warn you all.

I should have known what I was in for upon seeing the interior. No place to wait. Awkwardly tiny. Super dated. And, not in a charming, kitschy way. Whatever, though. I can overlook decor. I'm not here for the view.

Our service was pretty unmemorable. Well, until the end... We'll get there. 

My food was inexcusably bad. I'm no Gordon Ramsay and I could have made everything I had much better at home for half the price. The rice served with my meal was cooked to mush. But, bonus, it was also slightly crunchy and burned in spots! The green beans were so overcooked that they were falling apart before my fork even came in contact. And my \"seafood trio\" (that they had the audacity to charge TWENTY THREE dollars for) was so, so sad. I feel really badly for the fish that had to die to become this meal. The crab cake was the only semi-redeeming part of the meal, but being that it was literally bite-sized, my enthusiasm faded pretty quickly. The salmon (I'd estimate about 1.5-2 oz at most) was overcooked and tough. And the grilled shrimp? There were 3 of them. And they were smaller than cocktail shrimp. Also overcooked. I'll give Atria's credit for consistency, though, as nothing that I put in my mouth that night had any seasoning on it. Surely there must be some wiggle room in the budget to purchase some salt and pepper?

As I sat and marinated in the mediocrity of my night, the server stared at our table every time she walked by, making it painfully obvious that we were to leave, now. (I worked in the business for a long time. We weren't camping. We'd paid the bill all of 5 minutes prior. It was unnecessary.) 

tl;dr: Yep. Never again. Overcooked. Underseasoned. Overpriced. Underportioned. But, hey, free valet!"}
{"text":"Better than Soho down the street. Fairly original menu. Reasonably priced."}
{"text":"The food is always very good here with lots of choices.  Wait staff is top notch and they always remember us.  So fun with different menus for different times of year.  We had the Dublin Lawyer tonight for St. Patrick's Day.  Always a good time, good food, friendly crowd and staff, reasonable prices."}
{"text":"This was my first Artia's experience.  Very under-welhelming. Being a vegetarian, this
place was not vegetarian friendly.  The Tomato Vodka penne was like...meh.  It had 
only a few sprigs of spinach and the tomato sauce was too sweet.  It tasted like it came
out of a jar (it probably did).  It would be helpful to list vegetarian selections on the menu so I wouldn't have to ask the server.  I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to come back to Atria's...since there are all the same."}
{"text":"Fantastic food.  We had the fried zucchini as an appetizer, it was the best that I have ever had.  We tried the crab bisque which had a kick to it but was also very good.  Main course was Reuben and the fettucini both of which were fantastic.  Last but not least, the made from scratch strawberry shortcake.  Will certainly be back."}
{"text":"Our family gathered here to celebrate my niece's 17th birthday.  My brother made a reservation and asked that we be seated on the patio.  My husband and I arrived first and were seated in the dining room even though we said the reservation was for the patio.  When my brother arrived, he was upset and asked to be moved to the patio.  They happily accommodated us.  The waiter took our order but didn't return to ask how our food tasted.  He was also not attentive to our drink needs and it took forever to get our checks.  We finally had to ask for them.  My niece ordered linguine with stuffed shrimp; she said it was not good.  My parents both ordered the fried fish sandwich meal; again, their food was not good.  My husband and I both ordered the special barbecue platter.  The pulled pork was greasy and tasteless.  The ribs were regular ribs not baby back and were also greasy and tasteless.  Although the bacon wrapped pork medallion was flavorful, it was the size of a 50 cent piece.  The Gouda and bacon mac and cheese was nothing special.  The only item on the plate that was good was the potato pancake.  My brother ordered the steak salad.  He said it was okay; again, nothing special.  My sister-in-law ordered the planked salmon dinner and said it was good.  The reason I go into such detail is to show that out of 7 meals only one was worthy of the HIGH prices Atria's charges.  My family will never return to this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I have been here before for dinner and the food was very good. But my wife and i came for happy hour on the patio and were very disappointed. The very friendly wait staff had limited knowledge of the drink menu, and i received easily the worst, watered down Old Fashioned I've ever had. My wife got the wrong drink, but right on the second round! Flatbread was ok but too much balsamic. Boomer hangout."}
{"text":"This is definitely a place for a business lunch or a small gathering of friends. It's a very weird set-up; when you walk in, there's nowhere to wait if there are people ahead of you. You could wait at the bar, but its not that big & usually full. When you enter,  You immediately see a staircase that leads you to the upstairs. The food is good. I do like their famous pot roast nachos, but sometimes they can be a little soggy. The North Shore location at PNC Park has a better set-up in my opinion. However, if you're in the neighborhood, it's not a bad place to grab a bite to eat."}
{"text":"Showed up before a Pirate game. Wasn't very busy which was a plus. Server took our drink order, returned with drinks and took our food order. That was the last we saw of him. Someone else came by 35 minutes later and dropped our plates on the table and kept walking. Didn't matter that our food wasn't correct and our drinks were empty.  He managed to return as soon as we finished our food and left the check. Guess we were done?  Bathrooms were dirty and ladies room had no toilet paper or soap. Not a good experience.

Food was OK for the price. Service is terrible and won't return."}
{"text":"I came here just before a Pirates game so it was extremely busy. As a result I sat at the bar. I ordered the Pacific Salmon salad and it was absolutely delicious. The service was very friendly and attentive. The price seemed reasonable. My only issues were that there were some left over plates of food nearby that were waiting to be taken away that sort of detracted from the experience. Also, my plate did not seem 100% clean although it really wasn't a big issue. Given how busy they were I do understand and still give high marks for the tasty food and excellent service."}
{"text":"I tried to have a casual dinner here Saturday evening.  The only positive thing I can write is the valet was very friendly!  
We had a reservation but that didn't matter.  We sat at the bar for over 15 minutes where the bartender gave us the wrong drinks then ignored us as we tried to get correct drinks.  I had to remind the hostess that we still had not been seated after we watched people without reservations get seated as they walked in the door.  We were finally seated at a tiny table by the kitchen.  Keep in mind that the restaurant was by no means crowded.  Our waiter took our drink and dinner orders.  He brought us soup then never returned to our table.  The soup was very good, so that was a plus (soup and valet!).  
We never received water, or the drinks we ordered from the waiter.  We never received the food we ordered.  After 45 minutes, we left. Got up and walked right out.  A manager followed us outside but never apologized for the horrible service or huge wait time.  
From the hostess to the manager, everyone we encountered Saturday night was horrible.  The hostess could not be bothered to greet us then forgot about us, and we had a reservation arriving prior to that time.  The bartender gave us whatever drinks she wanted to, then left the bar area.  Our waiter, after taking our orders, attended to his other tables and did not even bring us 2 glasses of water.  The manager, admitting to the long food check time, dismissed our complaint.  The place is not worth the time it takes to make a reservation.  They will ignore it anyway!  I will, however, wave to the valet as I drive by to some other place!"}
{"text":"They have a great happy hour menu. This is what we ordered and it was all half price. Delicious. Atria's has valet parking and is open for lunch and dinner. Casual and kid friendly. Very quaint and you can also eat outside on the patio if you choose."}
{"text":"Great food.....BUT...Service was horrible...had to go fill my pop refills myself...server had to be snorting coke in between trips to table the way she kept tweaking out and sweating..i thought a few different times she was gonna pee her pants the way she was tweaking out.i even advised going to restroom before taking our order..we were only table she was taking care of too..waited 45-50 minutes out front to get in when they they said 25-30 minutes(seating just us 2,my son n myself)after 2 groups of 4 and 2 groups of 2 got seated that came 5 minutes before we were seated,were seated before us..the manager was walking around drunk and still drinking from a glass(wine/beer)the employees were eating out in the dining area at customers tables instead of sitting customers at them...my son ordered cod sandwich,i ordered smokehouse combo w pulled pork n ribs.they came back saying the cod was sold out,as well as the pulled pork and cole slaw that came w meal.said would double order of fries cause couldnt substitute for a salad?got 3 little onion rings n maybe 9 fries..would hate to see the single order..."}
{"text":"We had a dinner party for my parents' 60th wedding anniversary at the Atria's in Pleasant Hills.  A few weeks ago, the very helpful staff helped us to reserve a private room for the big day and to put together a menu for our party (which included about 30 people).  The room was the perfect size for our party.  The wait staff was terrific (friendly, attentive, and funny).  And the food was very good.  My parents could not have been happier with the way their party turned out.  Thank you, Atria's!"}
{"text":"At the suggestion of our hotel clerk we stopped to eat at this restaurant on a recent visit to the Pittsburgh area. Just to be fair, it was Father's Day when we ate there. We were really surprised when we were seated immediately since the restaurant was very busy. Once seated we waited approximately 20 minutes before someone even asked if anyone was taking care of us. The waitress looked very frazzled. We started by ordering drinks, iced tea and a club soda with lemon. The waitress forgot the lemon for the club soda. Next we ordered our dinners. My husband and I ordered the  bourbon braised pot roast served over mashed potatoes and our friend ordered chicken parmigiana. The dinners came with either soup or salad. Our friend ordered potato soup, but the waitress brought crab soup. She never brought the bread and butter that she said she would, another waitress got it for us once we asked. The dinners came out and the waitress tells us they are all out of mashed potatoes, would we like a baked potato instead. Not sure why she waited until the dinners came out to tell us. We were disappointed that she told us so late in the order.The pot roast was tender, but a little burnt with very little gravy and vegetables. It certainly lacked something without the mashed potatoes. The baked potato that she brought was way over cooked and we had to wait 5 minutes after she served our dinners, plus she forgot to bring the sour cream.  Our friend said his chicken parmigiana was fine. There did not seem to be any communication between the cook staff and the waitress. Even though you are busy it's no excuse for sub par food and service."}
{"text":"Each Atria's Restaurant is going to give you fine food.  I've had many business lunches as these restaurants and they always made me look good.  This particular location is a little extra special because of its regular musical entertainment.  Nothing beats an evening out at Atria's, eating some excellent food and listening to some good tunes.   

Of course you want to order the Pot Roast Nachos.   Somehow they manage to smother nachos with delicious shredded beef, cheese, jalapeños, and other kinds of yummy-ness, without the nachos getting overwhelmed or overly soggy.    

Eat at Atria's.   You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I always enjoy eating at Atrias. The Mt. lebanon location is like a cute little house and I love their outdoor seating. The restaurant is always very clean and the staff is always welcoming and friendly. Atrias has a small classics menu, but all their dishes are very good! I do think it's a bit on the price side, though. I love the chicken Marsala and the pot roast nachos are amazing! Atrias is a great Mt Lebanon establishment. I would certainly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Can't give this place enough stars.  Just stopped in on a whim and had a fantastic meal with family and friends.  The chicken picatta was great.  The chef even made an item off menu for one of the children in the group.  Very welcoming atmosphere and extremely friendly waitstaff.   Would not hesitate to recommend to anyone I know."}
{"text":"Bartender Jessi is wonderful. Made the best drink ever!  Exudes great customer service skills.  Excellent Asset to your establishment."}
{"text":"Try the crab bisque or pot roast nachos. Great place."}
{"text":"I was neither particularly pleased nor dissatisfied with my lunch experience here... It was just \"meh.\" It's kinda pricey for what you get, but the service is prompt and friendly and the music is fun and modern.

They serve a mean crab bisque. It was deliciously creamy, quite generous with the crab meat and very filling without that nasty sick after-feeling. The coconut shrimp (with a nice crunchy, coconut-y breading) was also very tasty, and the portion was satisfyingly large for an app! The house salad was just a typical salad of iceberg and romaine lettuce drenched in shredded cheddar cheese and sprinkled with a few other veggies. Nothing special.  Just a random quirk I noticed:  for being a rather classy restaurant, I was surprised that they didn't add a slice of lemon to my glass of water (though I'm sure you could ask for it).  

Would I recommend the place? Probably not but it was certainly not a bad experience! Just one that didn't stand out for the money you'll spend."}
{"text":"Atria's is a pretty good restaurant if you're at or near PNC Park - as expected from anything located in a ballpark it's not the best restaurant ever but it's consistently decent.  On different visits I have tried the Margherita Flatbread and Cheese Dip which were both fine (although the fried pita chips were really salty) as well as the Diablo pasta which was okay and the Pork Filet Gorgonzola which was quite good.  In an ideal world I would walk over the bridge and eat at a more unique restaurant downtown but when I have to choose from something nearby Atria's is one of the better choices.  A number of my colleagues prefer this as their go-to restaurant and while I'm not quite as enamored as them I definitely consider this an A-OK restaurant and I'll be back."}
{"text":"Was not impressed when dining two weeks ago.  The food was just okay, but the service was only average and should have been better.  It took about eight minutes before the server showed up, and he was not all that friendly.  The waiter took too long to return to our table to check on us after the food was served.  Another mistake, reaching across the table to present the check to me...a big no-no especially for a restaurant claiming to be upscale.  I will go to Cheesecake Factory next time where the food is better and so is the service."}
{"text":"I appreciate that you can make a reservation on Opentable, since it's a busy spot for game-day. We had food from the Oktoberfest menu and both of our dishes were great. The service is slow, but attentive. Overall, a great reliable spot for pregaming. A little pricey, but it's to be expected that close to the stadiums."}
{"text":"The food is always good at Atria's restaurant, although it's a little expensive in my opinion."}
{"text":"There are not many options for good dining on the North Shore and by process of elimination this is where we ended up during a Pirates game.  We were seated pretty quickly and they have options for indoor and outdoor dining. It was opening day and quite crowded but our server did a nice job. I started off with a Corona. My big disappointment was they had a special game day menu and it was very limited with not many options.  I went with the cobb salad and it was very good-fresh veggies and a nice portion size.  I do think that the prices are a little high."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for 15ish years.  The service has gone down hill consistently year after year for the past probably 5 years.  We keep going back because we still have this idea of what it used to be and we think it'll just one day miraculously go back to the way it was.  Well, last week's  visit will have us moving on to wishing for other, maybe more important, miracles because this one ain't happening.  Our food came out staggered.  My wife's when it finally came out was wrong.  All she ordered was a salad with lettuce and steak.  Nothing else.  And they got it wrong.  They gave her a little over half the normal dinner portion salad and the steak was cooked to the depths of the equator and back.  When we nicely told the person who came to our table because the waitress was nowhere to be found they got a manager.  The manager was nice and apologetic, but the waitress when she mosied on over days later never even mentioned it.  Also, the drinks... The water glasses sat empty on our table for over 30 minutes.  I worked in a ton of restaurants and bussed tables at both upscale and bar type restaurants.  Water glasses get filled as top priority.  Always.  It's so frustrating because this place used to be awesome.  Now, the people working there think they can get by on the restaurants past reputation instead of living up to the standards that once made it great.  With all these new foodie type restaurants coming up Atria's will be lucky to last unless they make serious changes.  Starting with the back of the house and server attitudes."}
{"text":"Now this is the Atria's I remember.

I have been coming to this location since PNC Park opened. In the beginning everything was great. Great food and outstanding service. Then everything went down hill. The most popular items were taken off the menu. The portions were cut down and the quality of the food when down with it. Service was horrible as well. We stopped going for years because by that time Pittsburgh was in a restaurant boom. The Cheesecake Factory, McCormick & Schmick's and a lot of other similar restaurants had opened.

I recently started going back to Atria's when a co worker decided to treat me to lunch since it's near my office. The great food and service is back! The burgers are excellent! I highly recommend the crab cakes, they are second best behind Monterey Bay. I love the Sherry Crab Bisque and the Pot Roast Nachos appetizer are a must try! 

I just went for a Christmas work lunch and everything was perfect. We had ten people and everyone loved their food. Everyone got something different, burgers, steaks seafood, salads and sandwiches. The service was excellent. All of our glasses were refilled constantly before they ever got even half way empty.

The Atria's I know and love is back!"}
{"text":"This location has a charming ambience, as it is located in a rather old building.  Went there for lunch, and had an okay meal.   Started with the soup- it was their Oktoberfest cheese soup. I swear I ordered a cup, but received (and was charged for) a bowl.  It was fine, though it would've been nice if it were served with bread.  For my entree I had the parmesan crusted tilapia, served with a side of pasta.  The pasta was cooked a perfect al dente, and the sauce was tasty (though applied sparingly).  The fish had a very nice, crisp crust. Unfortunately it utterly lacked seasoning (including salt). A cardinal sin of the kitchen.

Service was friendly, but absent minded. I was offered freshly grated parmesan, but the server had to go get it. By the time she found her way back to the table, some time later, I was already halfway through my lunch.  Though I was only dining with one companion, she couldn't recall who got what dish.

Warning- the parking is valet-only.  They do not charge for the valet, but, of course, you are expected to tip. This isn't something most people expect when dining in the suburbs, so make sure you have a few ones on you."}
{"text":"Been here many times.  There's always something not quite right with the service, unfortunately.  Recently visited with spouse, for an occasion, to try the Oktoberfest menu.  The dinners were delicious yet one wasn't warm enough.  Our server (name withheld) was friendly.  Our dinners arrived quickly, but we didn't have silverware from the start.  The (different) server delivering the meals didn't seem to notice silverware was amiss.  Our apps never arrived and we didn't receive bread.  It's just the simple details with service this place can't quite get right, given the apparent atmosphere the place is trying to deliver.  Maybe it's always understaffed or the servers are overworked.  Not sure.  I'd visit much more often, if I knew the experience would be positively consistent."}
{"text":"Tonight we were sans kids and decided to adventure out to try something new.   As first time diners we were treated with pot roast nachos with jalapenos and cheese, it was excellent. I had a cheese tortellini with chicken covered in alfredo sauce. It was a wonderful suggestion by our waiter. My husband had the arctic char special with wild rice and squash, also excellent.  We are definitely going to come here again. Next time we might bring the kids. Appropriate for well behaved older children."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place has gotten \"meh\" & \"blah\" reviews. Our experience today was much different. (Only drawback for me being that there is only 1 vegetarian menu option for lunch)
     Our waitress Allison, said she was new, but did a great job! Always quick with coffee re-fills but not overbearing. As it was our first time there, one of the chef's, Larry, personally delivered a free bruschetta to the table. He introduced himself, was very polite letting us know if we needed anything we could just ask for it. After the brushetta, we had the Quatro Formaggio Dip and Kevin had Clam Chowder. This was delicious, but probably not a great idea to split between two people before an entree. We ate half, and had half boxed up to save room. 
    For entree's I had Tomato Vodka Florentine and hubby had the Bleu Cheese Burger. He didn't read the menu closely & he was a little disappointed it wasn't actually bleu cheese, just bleu cheese dressing (as per the menu), but he said it still tasted good. Larry, the chef, delivered our entree's, and was again very polite and warm. We sat and drank coffee for awhile after dinner, not feeling rushed to leave. At the end of our meal, the owner came around to again check on how we enjoyed our meal. I found the customer service here to be superb.
     This is the original Atria's location, and the inside is kept to look like the inside of an old but well kept house. We had a great table on the third floor next to the window."}
{"text":"We enjoyed a Christmas party at Andrea's in the upstairs room. We worked with Becky on the menu and on the planning and things could not have been more wonderful. The room look beautiful the tables were perfect the food was lovely and that he was very professional and did a great job following up and taking good care of us."}
{"text":"Atria's is our \"go to\" before the ball game place to eat.    We try and get there early because there's always a wait.  To me that's a good sign.  The service is always very good, the beer is always cold, and the food is always good.  What else can I say.  Oh .... Yea.  The place is clean and the bathrooms are always well maintained.  

That's it friends.  Check out Atria's before a game and you won't be disappointed.  At least I have yet to be."}
{"text":"This atrias is our favorite. Best service and food of all that we have been to! I like the gibsonia one and starting to warm up to the pleasant hills one as well!
The Oktoberfest menu and their signature dishes are always a hit!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, but everything about it was extremely disorganized. Only one bartender was able to get anything accomplished (and thankfully he was the one serving me). The rest of the staff seemed to have no direction, and the aforementioned bartender was the one picking up their slack. Try as he could, he could not do it all. And this was only 4 hours before game time; it was bound to get busier as the day moved on.

That said, the food was good (Hawaiian Chicken Sandwich) and there is an extensive beer selection. I will certainly give Atria's another shot when I return to the Burgh."}
{"text":"Comfy place and service was excellent. 

I just thought the food was a little heavy and not diverse enough for my interests. Lots of heavy pastas,  meats...even the salads were all covered in cheese, eggs, bacon, etc. I went for the chicken Marsala which seemed to be one of the lighter dishes but was still pretty hefty. The chicken was a little tough and the sauce was overly heavy and sweet. Husband did like his pot roast a lot so they get an extra star for that. 

Looks like its super popular in Murrysville, so good for them."}
{"text":"Three meals here in the last month and they have not disappointed yet.  It's a fairly small menu but that said, everything I have had has been prepared to my liking.  It has been awfully hot as of late so I can assume eating outside will be nicer when the temp is under 90.  But overlooking the parking lot is not that great of venue anyway so I will probably stay inside.  Besides, the bartenders are friendly and helpful and usually a good crowd here after work.  I'll be back.  Often!"}
{"text":"After eating lunch several days a week at Atrias PNC Park restaurant for many years, I have finally decided that the price has just lost any relation to portions/quality and will not be dining there anytime in the near future.

Gradually, over the past year, the prices have continued to increase to the point of being dinner menu prices for lunch size meals.  Recently, the portion size has significantly diminished, to the point of being almost comical today.

The fish \"special\" today was BBQ salmon with asparagus.  It consisted of about 3oz of salmon and four spears of asparagus.  It actually looked ridiculous on the plate.  The specials used to have 5-6 oz of fish, included a decent portion of vegetables, and rice, all for a dollar or two less.  While a bit more than I wanted to spend for lunch, at least the quality and size of portion made some sense.  Today, I spent $15 plus tax and tip and left feeling like I had eaten an appetizer and still hungry.

They have pushed it too far, I am no longer willing to waste my money at Atria's.  Too bad, we used to really enjoy lunch there."}
{"text":"\"Are you SURE you want the bread?\"

We went here to avoid the crowds, and it was alright. I'm not one to complain, especially on review sites, but I have a few comments this time. Haha. I don't think the waitress had ill intentions, but when we asked for bread on the table (like everyone had?), she asked if we were sure and began to list the bread in our meals we ordered... So we didn't get the free (?) bread that she was telling the table behind us was so good... I don't know. 

She also informed us that the pizza we ordered got burned the first time around. And then when we ate it before the salad we ordered, she made a comment about how we \"must like the pizza more than the salad!\". Nah that's just how I eat things, lady. Again, I'm sure she didn't mean any harm, but eh. Still. The food was not that great, either. The holiday decor was pretty though."}
{"text":"I have to admit that I'm not a die-hard Atria's fan. I can't be, because Atria's tends to go back and forth for me - at least, this location does. 

On the one hand, I've had really good meals here. Octoberfest at Atria's, for example, is pretty darn delicious. The specials offered then are flat-out tasty - filling, carb-tastic and quite heavy, but definitely tasty! Similarly, the drinks I've ordered and the time I've spent at the bar section with friends have also been equally enjoyable.

But I've also had bad meals here that I simply can't forget about - particularly ones that were cooked with so much grease and sauce that my food literally fell apart in my hands or fell off of my silverware. I particularly remember this happening once with a burger I'd ordered. I admit, this was many years ago now, so in the interest of fairness, perhaps it's not a common issue anymore.

But the following is still a common issue: the parking lot. You have to let the staff park your car - resulting in a lag time as they look for a car they're much less familiar with than you are. And getting out is simply a nightmare as the exit connects to the road literally in the middle of a bend, just past a light. So drive with caution when leaving. Seriously. The people in a rush to get home and whipping around that bend are themselves enough to scare me away from eating here often, truthfully.

So yeah, this is not a go-to eatery for me. It's a nice place to dine in October for sure - and I'll stop in if someone has a coupon or invites me. But I admittedly don't go out of my way to dine here. Still, I do stop in periodically, so I guess that's what counts. 'Til next time, guys - because let's be honest, there will be a next time!"}
{"text":"When you walk into a buzzing restaurant, you'd expect to be greeted by someone, be that a server, a greeter or the bartender. I went in last night, stood around for almost 10 minutes, and was completely ignored. I was meeting a few friends, so I decided to walk across the street and grab a beer and make a reservation (using open table) for 45 minutes later.  Reservation confirmed, and beer finished, I walk back over, walk in to the place and someone's at the computer in the entryway on the phone. He finishes, we make eye contact, he nods and walks away. My friends come in, we wait 10 minutes for someone who works there to talk to us. I tell her we have reservations, she acts like it can't happen, and that it's my mistake, she says that the place is closed for a private party. I ask why there isn't a sign on the door saying 'closed for private party', and I get a ridiculous answer that the \"CEO doesn't like us to do that\". How dumb is that: you leave your system open to make reservations and you don't alert people that might be going to a show on the north shore that the place is closed. The fake sincerity is what really got me. You know what a 'private party' sign does? It advertises that you are available for private parties, and would have given me an hour to figure out other arrangements."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and it's definitely a hit with me.  Food is good, menu is interesting, and the service is exceptional.  I'm going back soon."}
{"text":"SLOW...I should've been tipped off when they sat us next to a table of corpses (ok, they were still alive at the time of this posting).  Well, not \"I want to talk to the manager\" slow, but enough to get the \"What the f*ck is going on here\" chatter going, with only 2 tables of patrons in sight.   I'll assume there was some party in the back, but still, you've got to plan for that.  

The waiter was nice enough to bring me a refill AFTER we got our check.  Gee. Thanks.  By the way, you know that scolding hot plate you brought me earlier, well, the fish on it was also boiling hot.  Thank God I was able to generate a nice cooling breeze with all that ice in my glass.

The good thing is they do usually have pretty good food.  However, I would recommend one of their other locations."}
{"text":"If you order to go from here make sure to take the time to view everything that you ordered.  Also know that their website is outdated and there are certain items are not available anymore so have back ups ready.  

We ordered on a Sunday around 430, we wanted The Rocks (not available), Southwest Chicken salad (not available), a Pacific Salmon salad (available), two Steak Salads (not available*), and Blueberry cheesecake (available).  The not available items were still on the menu on the website, which is supposedly being updated as this is a test restaurant for a new menu.

Picked up the order and brought it home only to find out the cheesecake was not in the bag.  Mind you, the place was dead.  Only several tables were seated.  I should've checked, this was my fault.  We called the restaurant and they comped us for the cost.  When we opened up all of the food we felt jipped.  *They \"created\" two $15 steak salad for us since they forgot to tell us it was no longer on the menu.  They used half a steak and a side salad per creation.  Both of the Salads combined equalled my Salmon salad.  There was no way these salads were worth $15 each.  Speaking of my salad, the Salmon was dried out and burnt.  They also gave us chili with our zucchini sticks instead of sauce.  (BTW, their chili is on the sweeter side)

When we called the restaurant back we spoke to the manager.  She comped us for the entire meal which was very fair and nice of her.  Just be sure to check everything in your order before leaving, right down to the salad dressing (which was also incorrect)."}
{"text":"This review is for the banquet and catering section of the restaurant. Unfortunately, I had to plan a luncheon after a funeral service for a family member recently. I picked this place out of the blue due primarily for its location. I spoke with their banquet coordinator Tracey and she was wonderful. We went through every detail and she assured me that she would take care of everything and SHE DID !  I could not have been happier. The service and food were excellent. The price was very reasonable."}
{"text":"Katie the manager of Atrias Murrysville just had to fix the situation we just experienced!
Waiting @ the bar to get seated @ the patio area & waited fifteen minutes & nobody offered is drinks or appetizers!!
Had to get Katie to fix our situation!
The credit for everything is on them!"}
{"text":"I had a buffet here. The fish is awesome  with the sause, the chicken is kind of dry. I love the brownie and chocolate biscuits. Great. I recommend this place."}
{"text":"You GOTTA try the Calamari...!
They have a new Dinner menu and a new Happy Hour menu.  We stopped in yesterday before the Penguins game and as always- Michelle greeted us with a warm smile and remembered our names.  ;)  Roy was behind the bar and automatically grabbed a glass to pour us our  regular drinks.  The taps must have been freshly cleaned because the Coors Light tasted perfect and I LOVE the chilled glass with every fresh beer.  We were going to just have one  before heading over to PPG Paints Arena but after Roy slipped the HH menu onto the bar and the calamari caught my eye- I had to try it.  It came out in about 10 minutes and the breading on it was perfect- light & airy and the calamari itself was soft & tender.  Calamari is a difficult dish to get right- cooked to little and its raw, cooked too much and it's like rubber bands.  This was perfect!  Served with a warmed cup of marinara for dipping and overtop a small bed of delicious hot pepper jardinière.  I mixed the jardinière with the marinara and it was perfect.  That hour flew by and before we knew it- it was time to head to the Pens game.  Do yourselves a favor- TRY THE CALAMARI...!!!"}
{"text":"As your standard restaurant, Atria's has no personality: the food is blah, the service is eh, and nothing is really all that memorable.  The patio and it's proximity to the ball parks are its saving grace.  

Now, let's talk about when we reserved a room for a bridal shower...  We had a fixed menu for a group of about 50 ladies.  I understand that.  But when the bride asks for no tomatoes, you as a server do not say, \"No substitutions!\" in your meanest voice.  Lighten up, it's her day.  I ended up just taking the tomatoes off for her--and just chalked it up to another maid of honor duty.  The server also kept clearing the bride's drinks while she mingled.  This was annoying, but at least we had paid a flat fee for drinks, so it wasn't the hugest deal.

Overall, the server for the bride's table was just awful and kept treating us like little children.  Yes, the table was the bridal party and the bride's cousins.  Yes, we are all under 30.  But we are also young professionals and the ones who booked the event.  The servers who waited on the rest of the tables containing the mothers, aunts, great aunts, and grandmothers were polite...even when my near-senile grandmother started yelling about bandits.  Later, another server apologized on behalf of our bad server and mumbled that, \"he just must be on his period.\"

While Atria's is fine for a glass of wine before a Pirate's game if a table is open outside, I certainly would never book it again for a private function."}
{"text":"I order the Chicken Marsala and it was pretty good. Let me tell you what wasn't good. The fact that I had to fight several flies for my food and that the waitress was on a different planet. It was so distracting and disgusting. I wasn't even sitting outside so there's no excuse. I can't imagine what the flies were doing in the kitchen and right now I'm about to gag. Again, the food was fine. I just couldn't enjoy because I felt like I was in a third world country being served by a space cadet."}
{"text":"Scott and Scott were wonderful to my family and I last night at Atrias. We have two funerals this weekend and wanted a nice relaxing dinner which is what we got! We had drinks at the bar and womderful Octoberfest food. Sadly, I forgot to take photos but the staff and the food were excellent! I also loved their Moscow Mule mugs which I need to find online somewhere. Thank you for the wonderful evening it was much needes and appericated."}
{"text":"We were passing through and found this restaurant on Yelp.  We enjoyed all our food.  Pot roast nachos and four cheese spinach dip - both delicious.  Chicken picata and ribs also delucious.  Carrot cake moist and delicious with lots of fruit and nuts (also huge!).  Friendly and attentive service as well.  Would love to stop again on another trip."}
{"text":"Great bar and good food. The etoufee is very salty but the BBQ trio is amazing. Great bar atmosphere and Angie is an amazing bartender!!"}
{"text":"Have been to most Atria locations over the years. Always enjoyed good food and great service. I convinced our group to go to Atria's Mt Lebanon for New Years Eve dinner. What a huge mistake. We arrived on time, 9 pm, and were seated immediately. Our drink order was taken and we were informed of the menu items no longer available and that they close at 10pm.  Our drinks arrived at 9:20, but they were not busy. I knew why when our calamari appetizer arrived, eight pieces of calamari on a big plated of hot peppers. Honestly embarrassing they would actually serve it. Overall it was my sorry mistake to have selected Atria's. With so many new restaurant choices available I won't be back."}
{"text":"Great service and food, order multiple items and wine, all great, family owned and owner made sure to stop by table and thank us. Really nice touch."}
{"text":"We had our son's wedding reception at Atria's in Fox Chapel.  The appetizers were awesome.  Pot roast nachos, crab stuffed filos and sausage stuffed peppers.  There were plenty served.  Our waiter's name was Kurt and he was WONDERFUL!  He kept the drinks going, remembered what everyone was drinking & was very personable &  professional.  We had a choice of chicken piccata, twin filets and crab stuffed salmon...everyone loved it.  Then the dessert trays came & they were lovely, delicious and just enough.
Thank you so much!!!!!!!!!!!   You made ME look good!!"}
{"text":"Going downhill......Man, what happened to this place? I used to frequent Atria's multiple times a week for lunch. Usually a ruben or the house salad with garlic vin. dressing and fries but recent construction near PNC Park has limited my trips. Well during this time Atria's must have made some major changes and not for the better. I decided to take the wife and kid to dinner b/c the day was nice and they do have outdoor seating. Unfortunately our waiter was not up to par. I sensed a little attitude when I asked if a particular dish was available but let his annoyed response slide. Atria's at PNC Park has a streamlined menu during Pirate game days. We then placed our order and shortly after I wanted to make a small change from the apps Sliders to the Kids menu sliders b/c they came with fries. Waiter then annoyingly rolled his eyes. I should have got up and left then but we were hungry and didnt want to go to another place for dinner. I asked if it was a problem and he stated they already started the order. Well, seems like a problem adding fries to a plate I guess....this interaction left me pretty angry and anyone who knows me would likely say I am pretty laid back. It is difficult to get under my skin. Onto the food. House salads for the wife and I which were pretty standard. I do love their garlic vinegar dressing. We also got a Chicken Ranch flat bread and this left us disappointed. In my pre construction visits this was one of the freshest, tastiest meals but I am not sure what they brought out yesterday. It reminded me of a Stouffer's french bread pizza. The sliders were fine but the fries seemed a lil cold considering it was the last thing ordered. All in all though I think my days at Atria's are done. At least the PNC Park location and that is sad since I was one of their biggest fans."}
{"text":"Wow was I disappointed. Best thing about it - $3 Guinness on tap. Ordered the chicken paprikash off the Octoberfest menu - the sauce was too thick almost like a BBQ sauce- not a fan- the spaetzel was overdone and rubbery. Hubby's Greek salad with Mediterranean grilled chicken was drowning in dressing that was too sweet. Service was slow and it didn't seem too busy.  Wish the food was better because it's so close - will most likely never be back"}
{"text":"Ugh, I hate this place.  People from work drag me here to lunch more often than I would like.  The food is overpriced.  The service is snotty and slow.  I can barely get free in under an hour-and-a-half.  The food is forgettable and the menu sparse.  They're terrible for pick-up too - even when you call way ahead, you're made to wait, and they're surly about taking care of you when you arrive for your food.  You can do better for lunch on the northshore pretty much anywhere.  Try SoHo or Finnegan's instead."}
{"text":"We arrived at 6pm on a busy Sat nite. A party of 6, we agreed to sit 2 and 4. We were at bar for a bit while waiting and bar tender was friendly and made us feel welcome. When our tables were ready, we were not given menus for about 20 minutes when we flagged down a bartender who brought them over and took our orders. Food took at least 20 more minutes to arrive. Salmon was great but not much rice and would have been better with a veggie side to round it out. Food overall was fine. They ended up comping some of our drinks."}
{"text":"The location is great if you're looking for a bite to eat before a baseball game. I had the Baja fish tacos and the pork filet gorgonzola, and the fish tacos were much better. The cabbage added a nice texture. The pork filet gorgonzola, however, was topped with blue cheese which I didn't care for, and the potato pancakes were way too salty."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a whim after a different non-chain restaurant had a wait-time that was longer than we were ready to accommodate.   We were pleasantly greeted and seated immediately.  Very nice.  They also take reservations, which is also very nice.  

We offhand mentioned we had never been in an Atrias, just making small chat, and the owner gifted us with some amazing pot roast nachos.  Very nice!  Very tasty!  

The service was good.  It was very crowded so allowances were made.  Décor standard, bathrooms clean.

Menu:  according to the waiter, it is mostly locally sourced and the dressings are made in-house.  

The menu is your standard salad, pasta, steak, seafood combo with a locally sourced emphasis.  The menu features common  South Hills fare with some interesting variations, and is mostly done well.  

Everyone had a great meal except for me.  The restaurant is in the middle of a seasonal menu change so they had a steak/sea special.  Both my husband and I ordered it.  My husband's was perfect.  Mine.... not so much.  My steak was perfect.  However, my lobster was both undercooked and possibly spoiled.  I tried to pawn it off to my husband, telling him I was \"full\" thinking that maybe I wasn't in the mood for lobster.  He spit it out.  The management did do the standard deduction from my bill, but the first taste is still in my mouth.  

Overall, standard South Hills pasta, meats, fishes and salads with a bit of a small touch of possible creativity - enough that we will go back for a family dinner."}
{"text":"I love Atria's. I came here for lunch with my girlfriend on a quiet weekday afternoon, and even though every other person there was pushing 80 years old, I still felt like the place had a young and fresh vibe. I don't understand, did the retirement home send a bus over or something? I guess I'll never know.

To start off we both ordered a cup of the House soup specialty at the time, Crab Bisque. The cream based Crab bisque was amazing, I even though about licking the bowel after finishing it was so good. The soup had a proper amount of crab meat in it and had an amazing sherry enthused aftertaste. 

My girlfriend decided to go all Americana and go with a Cheeseburger, while I chose to dabble with the Parmesan Crusted Chicken. She loved her burger, and ate every last drop of it, which is definitely a rarity because she hardly ever entirely finishes her meal. My chicken had a delightfully thin breading, that seemed to match harmoniously with the linguine and marinara. 

I definitely want to go back to Atria's and experience their dinner scene, as I was totally impressed by my lunch."}
{"text":"Here before Bucs VICTORY OVER THE CARDS in game 3 of the NLDS, a Sunday. Game at 4:30, got here at 2:30. Packed both inside and out. Can't comment on any other time but this really hectic one. 

Ordered Pepsi and brisket nachos. AWFUL. Soggy chips, some shredded beef drenched in sweet generic BBQ sauce, a blanket of cold congealed cheese spotted with jalapeño slices. Not a degree above room temp. 

Will give them 1 star for tasty Pepsi and keeping it filled."}
{"text":"I had such high hopes for this exquisitely adorable location. Unfortunately, the experience fell below my expectations. The service was delightful and our particular server was very kind. The food arrived quickly, but the order was incorrect. NO big deal and the server rectified that as quickly as possible though it left one of us eating solo on Valentine's Day (cue the violins). On the second try, my salad arrived with frozen lettuce. I didn't have the time or the desire to send it back yet again and that thoroughly put me off, so I gave up and took it home to await the thaw. The salmon on top was fair, as was my date's (who ordered a different) salmon, but we both left underwhelmed."}
{"text":"I was meeting up with 3 other people there. But I was a few minutes late.  Because I wasn't there at the time,  they refused to seat the others.  Not even to just get drinks or an appetizer ordered.  So they left to go to some place that would serve them (Dominic's)  This place clearly couldn't be bothered to have our business,  which seems like an odd way to run an organization.  One star because we didn't get anything that we wanted."}
{"text":"I can't review the food because we never ate. We went in around lunchtime or slightly after. The hostess nicely asked us if we had a preference as to where to sit but when we said a booth she kind of rolled her eyes and said she'd have to clean one. Then she just came back grabbed menus and started walking away so we followed her. It was a rather large dining room but there were only two other tables seated besides us. But in 15 minutes we saw one waiter and all that occurred was he took one tables order gave the table next to us water never stopped at our table. We had debated whether to come in here or right next door to Hoss's Steakhouse. So finally after about 15 minutes we got up and were leaving and the waiter came over with a stern semi surprised look on his face and said where are you going? I said Hoss's."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place.  I had back-to-back experiences with this place that were not the greatest, not in terms of my own satisfaction but in terms of how a business is run.  Let me start with the first one that was a take out experience.  We had a small get-together to watch a Steeler's game and we thought of ordering from Atria's.  Since their wraps are amazing, most of us (6 in number) wanted to order a wrap.  However, when we called they told us that the tortillas were over and they could not serve us the wrap (weird for a restaurant to be out of tortillas in the afternoon).  Then some of us changed the order to salads and some to other items, one of which was a turkey club.  After a while, the phone rings and it was Atria's to let us know that they did not have enough turkey to make the club, so we had to order something else! This was another bummer right there.  When we got the food everything was fine but still all this made the whole experience a bit bitter.  

One week later, we decided to give it another try, this time dining in the restaurant.  The atmosphere and the place is really nice and enjoyable.  Everything on the menu seemed nice and the stuff was helpful for sure.  In terms of food, the new item on the menu, the baked ziti is phenomenal, and the pork fillet gorgonzola is great as well! However, again there were some small stuff that made the whole experience a bit weird.  For example, again one of the orders could not be accomplished since some ingredient was again missing! Also, when the burger that I had ordered came in it came without the side! When the waitress served the burger she did not mention anything about it so we had to ask her about them. Of course they served the side as well later, but I would have expected the stuff to be proactive and mention that there will be a small delay in the side due to some reason.  

I really wish I could give a better rating to this place, but both the experiences I had,  had some flags with regards to the way this business is run."}
{"text":"I have been going to Atria's for years, but my last few visits really made me want to skip it.  A few nice points, the place is nice looking.  They did a good job making it look upscale, and in the small town of Murrysville there aren't a ton of higher dining establishments to choose from.  That said they are often busy and can get crowded and long waits to get a table.  The bar is even worse!  I think they may have seating for 10, so if you are a lucky one to get a seat to wait or drink be careful if you have to get up to use the restroom as there are people huddled behind you two rows deep ready to pounce on your seat..  So that's annoying.  Another thing I have noticed is that the menu is small and really hasn't changed much if at all in the past 8 years.  Last time I was there I got the scallops and was really not happy.  They were rubbery overcooked and small.  The rice they were sitting one tasted microwaved and old, and for all this just a measly $20.00.  Can I say overpriced? Yes three quarter sized scallops and a spoon of old mushy rice, $20.00 plus tax$tip.  I don't think I will be ordering that again.   Maybe just stick to a burger or something.  Anyhow I will go here again it just wouldn't be my #1 overall pick even in the little town of Murrysville."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible.  We should have turned around when we walked in and saw only 4 occupied tables in this relatively large restaurant during a busy lunch hour.  I ordered the crab bisque and a mixed green salmon salad.  The crab bisque was extremely salty.  The \"mixed greens\" salad contained chunks of iceberg lettuce.  Using an 89 cent head of lettuce for a $15 salad is hardly acceptable.  I sent the salad back.  When discussing the definition of \"mixed greens\" with the waitress, Elizabeth, she was rude and argumentative.  The food and service were equally disappointing. The experience was unfortunate and needless to say we will never return.  If you enjoying paying for a plate of tasteless nutrient lacking food that is loaded with salt this is definitely the place for you."}
{"text":"There was nothing wrong at all with this place for a Saturday lunch...it's just not outstanding.  I had fish tacos which were tasty with a nice slaw and salsa but could have had more fish...my other good experiences with fish tacos include the Mitchell's chain (these were close to those) and food trucks in Austin (these were not in the same league). Other  folks had a chopped salad, which had a good variety of vegetables, and a mushroom soup with some sherry which was flavorful. Waitstaff was good and the restaurant itself was nicely appointed. I would go back but not expect to be blown away by the menu or preparation."}
{"text":"This was our second time going to this place - to which I really enjoyed myself...again.  The place has a comfortable and lively atmosphere with really polite and friendly service.  

Ample portions of quality dishes are on the menu - and the food was served promptly throughout each course of the meal.  There was one issue, as one of the diners in our group had some under-cooked pork - which was promptly attended to and handled quite well with a replacement dish at no charge - which, to me, showed great attention and care for the customer.

All in all, this place is \"two for two\" in terms of great service, delicious food, and a good time by all - so this place will stay on my list for places to eat at in the Murrysville area."}
{"text":"We went tonight so we could get some things from both the fish menu and the St Patrick's Day specials.  Service as usual was fantastic.  My son got a filet that was so tiny about 3 bites.  My husband got the Dublin Lawyer it was not as described.  It was not IN a puff pastry shamrock, there was a piece of pastry the size of about a quarter.  The Frozen Leprechaun martini was a very tasty as a dessert.  But to describe it as a martini is off there was very little alcohol.  I think when promoting specials to draw customers in its very important to deliver as described."}
{"text":"This used to be our go to spot for dining when we had people in from out of town. Cute atmosphere, outdoor seating when weather permits, free valet parking, great menu with something for everyone, seasonal menus and affordable prices. I miss it . . ."}
{"text":"Of the 4 Atrias locations we've been to this was the worst. Slow service...took 45 mins after salad served to entrees served and it wasn't crowded. Poor all the way around. The food wasn't as good as the others. Won't go back to this location."}
{"text":"We go to Atrias about twice a year because my wife likes their steak salad. This time she said it definitely was smaller and not as good...for $16 ugh. I think the entire menu is over priced and service is never above and beyond. I don't see us going back. Too many other restaurant choices that are better."}
{"text":"Thank you James and staff for the wonderful entrees and for giving us one more reason to like Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I have enjoyed dining at Atria's over the years.  I used to love their Pot Roast Nachos, but a few years ago they changed the recipe (the pot roast is nowhere near as generous as it used to be).  But I would say the food is reliably good, and the service is generally excellent (except when they are overwhelmed on game days).  

I do have a great story about meeting Hulk Hogan at this location once, so I do have a special fondness for Atria's.  They are well managed and local.  

But the dining scene in Pittsburgh has become a lot more creative, I think Atria's needs to keep up and offer something new and different.  Until then, it's still pretty good and fairly reliable."}
{"text":"After a tour along the North Shore with Allegheny City History group we stopped at Atria's to finish off a great night. We had about 18 people that decided to stop for a bite to eat and beverages. I can't say enough about the wait staff... right away they started moving tables around to accommodate the group. The more that came the more they kept accommodating us! Nice!  They never once made it like we were bothering them like some places do. 

Once we were settled the hostess brought a container of water for my dog, didn't even have to ask for it! Nice. I ordered the Salmon salad with poppy seed dressing! WOW that dressing is very tasty as well as the salad.  Everyone felt that the food was good and the service was exceptional. I can't say enough about the wait staff and here it is the bonus...  usually with a group they do one check and add the tip.... our server kept everything in order, was pleasant all evening and keep all of the checks in order and right....all of the staff were very friendly.
The bonus for the evening was Johnny Angel was singing and came out and talked to everyone and loved that we did a tour of the Northside his hometown... 

Thanks to all of you in making this a very pleasant experience... Stella"}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. Went to Easter brunch, was served some coffee from a can. Waited over 45 minutes for an order of chicken piccata that also tasted like it came from a can. When I asked the bartender/waitress (classy) how much longer it will be, she was cold and un apologetic about the ridiculous wait. I don't understand how this place is even in business. If this establishment were to be in any other city they would be closed. If I'm paying $25 for some fake Italian food at least be polite about the robbery. This place is a fusion of Olive Garden and Red Lobster. DO NOT COME HERE. I realized that the tactic of starving the customer and serving overpriced mediocre food can pay the light bills. Thanks Atria's, see ya never"}
{"text":"The pot roast nachos are still good. The service is sketchy. The nachos were supposed to be a starter. They were delivered AFTER the soup and sandwiches."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. There's a very loyal local clientele for the bar business. It's a converted house so it has a very homey atmosphere. Valet parking is a nice touch because local parking is difficult. Probably a little too pricey but the food is as good as more expensive restaurants. People seem to enjoy eating outside (even in colder months). Don't leave without trying the Pot Roast Nachos - they are amazing."}
{"text":"Came here for Easter brunch yesterday.  This was my 2nd visit to this location (the first was over a year ago.)  I want to point out that we all came prepared to be patient, because I know that holidays like this are hectic for restaurants.
We were running late for our Easter brunch reservation, because our car got blocked in at the church parking lot. I called and let them know and they were understanding. When we arrived (15 minutes after our original reservation), the first person we spoke to made it sound like we were supposed to be seated in the upstairs dining room.  Instead, when we were finally seated (2 adults, 1 kid, 1 baby) we were seated in the back room on the 1st floor right next to the bathroom. It was fine - relatively quiet back there, but I get the feeling this is where families with small kids tend to be seated. I also got the feeling that we may have had a table on the 2nd floor, but missed out because we were late.

Our server was great, I'm sorry I can't remember her name. Our youngest has a dairy allergy and she instructed the kitchen to not add butter to the slider buns, etc, but they did it anyway, and she promptly had the buns replaced when I pointed it out to her.  I appreciated that. 
Our oldest was happy with his kids grilled cheese & fries.  Our toddler ate some of the bun, but didn't like his plain sliders (I tried them - they must have had a rub on them - they were very salty! Please don't do this to kids' food items!)  
I had the bananas foster french toast. The actual bread/french toast part was great; however it was so overly sweet, I had to stop eating it. My husband ate one of the pieces as his desert. The description says \"...with caramelized bananas, whipped cream and candied pecans served with bacon\". It was actually very few slices of banana drowning in caramel sauce (not the same thing as \"caramelized\"!) With 2 greasy, limp pieces of bacon. Bananas are SO inexpensive - please be a bit more generous with them!  If I'd known it was like that, I would have asked for the caramel on the side. My husband ate the pot roast hash, which came with a surprise potato pancake (pleasant surprise, though not included in the description). He said that the flavors of the hash, etc. didn't make any sense (I'll leave that open to interpretation). Once he mushed everything up together and put some ketchup on it, he said it tasted better.
So, overall, our experience was fine, service was good, valet service good, but the food  was \"meh\" for us, unfortunately. And, for the prices, I'd expect better."}
{"text":"Get the cheese nachos appetizer! It's very unhealthy but delicious!  

Atria's is a decent American Restaurant with plenty of space and parking. They're open throughout most of the day so it's convenient whenever you're hungry. Portion sizes are huge and reasonably priced. I got the salmon salad with strawberries with dressing on the side and it was what you'd expect a salmon salad to be.  

I tried the ribs which are definitely not their specialty. I would recommend sticking to more basic options. The nachos appetizer was quite good but also quite bad for arteries. Overall, if you are hungry and don't want to think too hard about what you want to eat then you could stop by at Atria's for a bite. Their menu is also quite diverse ranging from salads, a couple of soup options, pasta, burgers, and some protein options."}
{"text":"I have been to Atria locations around the city - but this was my first time at the Atria's location at PNC Park on the North Shore of Pittsburgh. My young professional group had an event there last night, so it was a good chance to check it out. Our event was held upstairs, and since we had a small group, they wouldn't guarantee the private room downstairs. It worked for the most part, but those of us that sat in the back had trouble hearing the speakers, and the lights were dim. The noise from the diners downstairs plus the house music carried through and at times it was very loud and hard to hear. I would say that it's a good place for a group dinner, but not for a speaking event. I can't comment on food/drink as I didn't have any. The atmosphere is nice BUT I wasn't too impressed with the layout of the whole place. Didn't see to have a good flow to it. Also, the bathrooms upstairs where our event was were out of order, so everyone had to go downstairs to use the restrooms."}
{"text":"Went here the other day for a birthday celebration with the family. Getting there we realized we messed up the open table time and they were full. The hostess did a great job accommodating us and getting us in as early as she could, which was a half hour before my open table time! To pass the time we had martinis and the amazing nachos on the appetizer menu at the bar. When we got to the table everything was fine. Our waiter seemed to be overwhelmed with tables and it took a while to get drinks,bread, and orders done. The food was great! My mother and I  had the salmon with miso glaze, my father the filet and my brother the chicken parm. All were good and came out as ordered. I'm sure the service isn't like this all the time so if you're in the area it's definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Major improvements for this location. Gorgeous inside, with a warm homey feeling. If possibly, sit in the bar with Adam, Pete or Ang they've all been there since the beginning! Seasonal menus and the staff are what makes the place easy to come back to. Definitely know what special is going on for drinks the day you'll be there, it can really save you!"}
{"text":"We dined here tonight and had a great experience.  When seated, the room was very cold.  We asked about moving to the main dining room, but our server assured us they would warm it up, and they certainly did.  When we left, it was downright toasty in there.  
The story tonight was about our server.  She was excellent, friendly, professional, and even described several of their lower cost menu choices as her favorites (rather than the usual suggestions you get of how wonderful the most expensive item on the menu is).  She was very attentive, and gave the impression that she wanted to do whatever it took to make us happy customers.  Two minor service glitches that we had no problem overlooking were the length of time it took to get our bottle of wine, and I ordered their seasonal Butternut Squash soup, but was served shrimp bisque.  When I discovered the mixup, I decided to keep the bisque, but mentioned the error to our sever.  She apologized and offered to bring the correct soup.  We declined saying it would be too much.  She immediately said she'd take the soup off our bill, and then brought out a small taste of the squash soup so we would know how it tasted for \"the next time\".  The squash soup was much better!  The bisque is very rich and tastes strongly of Sherry, but it is also very salty.
My meal was their crab cake and petite filet.  The filet was cooked perfectly.  I asked for, and was given stone-ground mustard for the tasty crab cake.  The sides were also very good. The asparagus was cooked tender-crisp and the roasted red skin potatoes were so good they might have been my favorite item on the plate!  
My wife had their always reliable overnight pot roast.  We exchanged tastes of each others meals, and concurred that both were good choices.
We brought almost half of our meals home, but that left room for a small desert.  Our server suggested a scoop of their Dulce de Leche ice cream, and we took her up on it.  It proved to be, as the old light beer commercial used to say:  tastes great - less filling!  Our only complaint is their coffee.  It is rather weak and lacking in body.  But that's a pretty minor issue."}
{"text":"Atria's is a solid four stars. Nestled in the luxurious community of Murrysville, atria's offers fine dining, a semi glamorous atmosphere, glamorous people, great service, and great food. 

I went out on a limb and ordered something outside of the box. I decided to go with the shrimp and grits that was covered in a spicy Creole sauce. I also had a bowl of clam chowder before my meal. I was not disappointed! It scratched me right where I itched. My wife got crab bisque and a salad while my children split chicken fingers. I was more than pleased to see that they had east end big hop on draft. What a great experience.

As Arnold once said: \"I'll be back\""}
{"text":"\"Quality food at at an affordable price,\" I think not! My recent experience at Atria's was rather disappointing. 
The positives: I called to make reservations for 3 at 6:30 and was able to get in at 8pm last Friday night. When we arrived, they were able to accomodate us outside on the patio which was nice since it was such a beautiful evening. The Oktoberfest menu had a large selection of german food including apps, entrees and desserts. 

The negatives: The food. Although the menu seems to have a diverse selection of options, I was disappointed in the quality of the food, especially for the price. Our table started with the baked pretzel appetizer with mustard dipping sauce off of the Oktoberfest menu. The pretzels tasted like generic frozen pretzels I could buy at giant eagle. Nothing exciting there. I then ordered the chopped salad which was the only highlight of the meal as it was exactly as described on the menu and had a full days worth of veggies. For my entree, I ordered the bourbon glazed pot roast with vegetable gravy and red skin smashed potatoes. Although the bourbon added a nice sweetness to the pot roast, I wasn't able to fully enjoy the flavor due to the fact that my 3 peices of pot roast were 80% fat. Yes, I understand that pot roast is a fattier cut of beef. However, I do expect to be able to eat at least half of what I am served. I was thoroughly enjoying the red skin smashed potaties until I bit into a full clove of garlic. Don't get me wrong, I eat enough garlic to keep the Robert Pattinson's away but, I don't eat it raw or in whole cloves. In addition, the vegetable gravy was more of a soup that the pot roast and potatoes sat in. My dining companions were also not impressed with their meals. The Maine bay scallops were presented in a glorious fashion but fell short of taming a manly appetite. Three medium-large scallops and a side of rice for $20 is a bit excessive to me. 

The in betweens: Service. Although the server was friendly and accommodating, the food took quite some time to arrive and was barely warm. 
All in all, even though we were intrigued by the Oktoberfest menus, I probably won't be going back to Atria's anytime in the near future."}
{"text":"great food consistently ruined by poor service and underqualified management. 
yes, we showed up on a saturday without a reservation, and agreed to wait the 45 minutes quoted. but over an hour later with more than10 visible open tables we had still not been seated. after asking for the third time what was going on we were begrudgingly seated. the manager apologized and offered to pick up an appetizer so we thought everything would be ok. but it was not to be. excruciatingly slow and utterly indifferent service put the last nail in the coffin for us. we will have to find another location as this is the second time in 2 months that we have had the exact same experience here. a free appetizer only goes so far if your server treats your guests like she wishes they would just go away."}
{"text":"I organized my fraternity banquet here for a party of around 50. I worked with a nice lady named Natalie and she helped me select custom menus and layout of the dinner area. The decoration was amazing! We had christmas trees and tons of lights everywhere. The staff was great, everyone was friendly and super helpful. Food was great, buffet style appetizers and desserts and awesome entrees. I've been to the Atria's in Fox Chapel and both just gave us amazing service and great vibes.

Also, one of my friends drank too much and puked in their bathroom and left it a mess. But the staff was super friendly and cleaned it up with no extra charge. I love it. I recommend this place for any dinner event or formal or banquet or activity. It's such a pleasure to work with them. Best value, best views, best staff, best experience. 6/5."}
{"text":"They offer an amazing Sunday Jazz brunch.  The staff was incredibly friendly, the food was wonderful and the ambiance was awesome.  I highly recommend it.  Patricia our server did a wonderful job of welcoming us and explaining the cocktails"}
{"text":"I have called twice now to speak to the banquet manager. It's been two weeks and no one returned my call. When I called the lady who answered sounded exasperated both times when I asked for the banquet manager. 

Such a shame to lose business over bad customer service."}
{"text":"The crab cake was killer good. Veggies cooked to perfection. Service excellent. Everything was far better than I expected."}
{"text":"Made the mistake of going to dinner recently at Atria's and I'm not sure we will return. I hate sounding rude, but nothing about this place was impressive. We were sat in a small room directly to the right of the entrance and that really should be reserved for larger parties. It was completely awkward sitting in there with one loud table and just us two. Our service, including the hostess, and the food was nothing special. Bread for our dinner came out before our appetizer. Their pasta entrees don't include a salad or even a veggie side which is a little strange, imo. The spinach florentine and chicken parm were just eh. I think the best part of our dinner was the valet, he got us right out of there which is what we needed."}
{"text":"Stopped in specifically for the pot roast nachos, which have been amazing at other locations so I was very disappointed to discover they were out of pot roast. I decided on the pot pie which I've heard very good things about so it seemed like a good alternative. I was wrong.  It was basically a puffed pastry on top of thin gravy.  No chicken.  Not even one piece. No potatoes or any other filling except a few peas.  That was it.  I was starving so I ate the entire thing but was still hungry afterwards so I ate again as soon as I got home.  Extremely disappointing."}
{"text":"Atria's in Murrysville is located somewhat inconspicuously at one end of a small strip mall along William Penn Highway. Parking was ample.

As two of my three dining companions are retirees, we arrived quite early for dinner (about five-thirty) and were seated promptly. We had a reservation, but I don't think we needed it, but the dining room did fill up while we were there.

Earlier that day I had complained to one of my companions that having one's coat taken and hung up at restaurants was becoming too uncommon. At Atria's, our coats were taken and hung up, and I was pleased to be proved wrong so quickly.

The dining room and tables were more elegant than I expected given the reasonable price ranges on the menu. Although the room filled while we were there, the noise level remained comfortably subdued. We were able to have a conversation over dinner without shouting. Service was attentive but not intrusive.

Two of us had well-made $5 martinis. I had the Pork Filet Gorgonzola ($15.99) which arrived as three bacon-wrapped medallions on three potato pancakes. All of us enjoyed our meals. I had my left-overs for lunch a couple of days later.

Over all, a very nice little place to dine."}
{"text":"The place itself is a little too dark. We were seated upstairs in the back by the window and it was still to dark. There are some lighting on the walls but just didn't do much. I would suggest maybe some candles on the table. Food was ok. Just little too plain for the price. Our server was nice but just little too slow."}
{"text":"Great service and great food. I cater from Atria's all the time. They come well in advance and set everything up! When I need a nice hot lunch I call Atria's. The only suggestion I have is for their salad. The bin they use is too big and lately the salad has not been as green and fresh as it should. I would still order it again (not the chopped)."}
{"text":"This is a nice place.
The fried zucchini is a must have.  I had a Rachel (turkey & vole slaw) on rye, lots of meat and just the right amount of dressing. My wife had the Tomato Vodka Pasta, it was fantastic."}
{"text":"I *love* this place!

I recommend using Open Table or calling for a reservation ahead of time because this place gets PACKED.  Somehow I can always get a reservation right away, but without a reservation there's a wait.

They have a really nice outdoor patio that I like in the warmer months.  In the colder months its indoors, and the building used to be an old hotel.  It feels like an old building.  Its a nice restaurant but it does look a little bit dated upstairs with the green stripes on the walls.

BUT---are you here to check out the decor or are you here to EAT?

I effing love Atria's food.  It's probably so unhealthy but I don't care.  Why is it so good?  How???  I strongly recommend the Miso Glazed salmon, the meatloaf, the pot roast, the goat cheese ravioli and their reuben's are to die for.  Literally you might die, bc they are so tasty they've got to be FULL of butter.

No one ever ate a reuben for their health.

The pot roast nacho's are OUTSTANDING.  In fact ,any time I want to get my Dad to come to Atria's with me, I don't ask if he wants to go to Atria's, I ask if he is in the mood for Pot Roast Nachos.  Turns out, Dad's always in the mood for pot roast nachos.

The only thing on the menu I don't recommend are the fish tacos.  I had them on Saturday and they were just not excellent.  Still tasty though!

The service is outstanding.  Our waitress this past Saturday was Daya and she was so pleasant that we'll ask for her section when we come back.

They have a killer cocktail list too, the Blood Orange martini tastes like angels squeezed it from golden oranges in heaven.  ???  Ok, I don't know what that meant, it is just a damn good martini.

Also, I spent my formative childhood years in Stuttgart, Germany.  Their Oktoberfest menu is HANDS DOWN the most authentic, best tasting German food in Pittsburgh.  I get asked where to get the best German food all the time.  It's at Atria's, during their woefully limited Oktoberfest menu.

The Chicken Paprika is ...  AUSGEZIECHNET.  WUNDER BAR.  Really effing good.  

Everyone in Pittsburgh eats at Atria's, but if you havent yet, you really should make a reservation!"}
{"text":"Food was great service was excellent.  My only complaint was I arrived at restaurant at 9 pm and was told after being seated that due to restaurant being slow that they were closing early and kitchen started to break things down.  Hostess stated that we wouldn't be able to get things like mashed potatoes or rice.  The website states they are open till 11 pm!  So they were shutting kitchen 2 hours early and this was a Friday night!  Very disappointed that we had a limited menu to choose from we ended up just getting burgers that were very good but would rather have had a dinner.  So BEWARE if your going there for a late dinner."}
{"text":"Atrias is by far my favorite restaurant in Murrysville. The pot roast nachos are unreal and I crave them when I go back to Ny. I come back just for them! The chef is also really flexible. Staff is friendly and always welcoming. They have a great wine selection as well."}
{"text":"Boy has this place gone downhill! It used to be one of my favorite, \"go-to\" places in Peters, and we often ordered take out. But over the last few years the food quality has drastically slipped. 

On my last trip, a late afternoon after playing golf, we went to the bar area for a few appetizers. The Pot Roast nachos had about 2 tiny slivers of dried meat, the fried zucchini was all thick breading, and no taste. The Crab bisque was overly salty, and filled with shells. 

Recent take out orders have consisted of 2 fish sandwiches with a credit card sized piece of thin, dried out, fish (Now I'm not one of those people looking for a mega-giant sized piece of mediocre fried fish on a bun. But this was ridiculously tiny, and less than mediocre in taste) . .....And they gave me the wrong side salad. The order a few weeks after that was also wrong. Wrong soups this time. 

I d have to say that their burgers are very good. And sometimes they'll even get your order right when you request no mayo.Not often, but sometimes. That's about the only reason I gave them 2 stars instead of the 1 star they've really earned over the last few years. I've also had some great fillets there (and also some that were tougher than beef jerky), and some good ribs. But quality control is severely lacking, so you never know what to expect. Someone in your party will most likely leave disappointed.

I used to eat here about once a month for years. As the quality declined, so have my visits. Now I go, dragging my feet, a few times a year. But after my last few experiences, I think I'm done."}
{"text":"So I have been to Atria's on a number of occasions and one thing has become apparent to me... It gets worse each and every time.  

My husband and I decided to come here after work for a quick dinner and enjoy the outdoor dining at this location.  Although our service was good (not great, just good), everything else was less than decent.  The mahi mahi was not good at all, my asparagus seemed like it was fresh out of a freezer steambag, and even my salad dressing was yucky.  Maybe I'm just making bad menu choices, but if that is indeed the case, the menu for me is becoming more and more limited.  

I think this is a good spot to drop by for a drink and apps before a game at most."}
{"text":"Today i had the best soup i think I've ever had; Sherry Crab Bisque; out of this World awesome although my Caesar salad was very average.  My wife ordered the Miso glazed salmon which melted in your mouth it was so good!  The service was also extremely attentive and jovial; at one point we had three different wait staff check on us.  As for the dessert, it was very good but not great :)"}
{"text":"Sunday night, not too busy, seated right away. Took longer than usual for someone to get to me. Ordered the chicken Roma I think it was called. It was bland and despite asking for Parmesan cheese twice there still wasn't enough. And the first server who put it on couldn't get much to come out and then said she was new. Then she cranked it harder and subsequently stuck the cheese grater into my linguini... She apologized and offered to bring me a new dish but I didn't want to wait and wasn't going to eat all that linguini anyway so I just cut that area away and ate the rest. The funniest part was that I asked for more parm and the waitress brought over the same grater and after I told her about the other incident she commented, 'oh yeah I can see that' because obviously the other server didn't bother wiping the sauce off the grater and she just continued on, yuck!!! Sorry to say but I wouldn't recommend this place, food was marginal and service lacking!!! Btw they have some house pancetta salad that was drenched in really pungent vinegar based dressing, way overpowering!!! Need to tone it down."}
{"text":"what happened to this chain? 
we've been Atria's supporters for decades and have watched this chain, multiple locations, skimp on quality while maintaining (increasing?) prices. we gave up drinks at the ball park (we're season ticket holders) but thought we'd give MtL yet another chance - thinking our last poor experience was a fluke.  we shouldn't have wasted our time. 
the quality and taste of everything ranged from fair to poor. not only did we wait 75 minutes for our food, but it was really terrible. 
my husband (and the person at the table next to us) sent back Shrimp and Grits - the grits were like flavorless, chalky paste. I had the Gorgonzola pork tenderloins, the pork was cooked properly, but the only enjoyable aspect was the potato pancakes. we ended up splitting my meal because we waited another 25 min for his replacement of fish and chips, for which we still paid full price. no comped drinks, no apology beyond our waitress. nothing. 
the only positive was our waitress, Regina, was lovely. 

we're sad to see this local chain continues to go south. sadly, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, good food, decent price. Even when they make a mistake, they make it good as quickly as possible. Scott is an awesome server. Definitely coming back for $5 martini night as a girls night"}
{"text":"Solid if not fantastic Italian food. But the best part is it's right beside PNC Park. It's fun to sit outside and listen to a game going on while you munch. The seafood was much better than I'd have thought for such a touristy spot. Sometimes you just hit a place at the right time in the right mood, and everything works out great--you get exactly the kind of food you were hoping for, in a relaxing atmosphere and you just feel happy. This was the case when my wife and I had dinner here with my son on the first day of one of our trips to Pittsburgh. Oh, and they have a good beer selection."}
{"text":"I'm an avid Atrias goer and today was by far my FAVORITE experience. I got the chopped salad and crab bisque (my usual) and finished it off with the limoncello cake...HEAVEN!! The best part of the meal was having Jerry as our server. Just such a large personality! He's seriously the best!! We will DEFINITELY be back again!!"}
{"text":"I think the quality of food has been slowly going downhill. 
Over priced for the quality.  I now only go to Atria's for Oktoberfest. 
Also, I see the managers there acting like they are gods and the poor high school kids have to absorb their mid life ego power trips.  Almost told one of them off but didn't because you don't mess with people that serve your food."}
{"text":"Not sure why mediocrity is acceptable 
While the food quality is ok at best, the service is just okay, drinks are pricey servers eating in the open, bartenders munching on fruit, and they havent changed the menu in 5 years. Its BORING
 Miso salmon, with jasmine rice wow thats a game changer, maybe in 2005.
Revamp the menu, more fresh seafood, local influences, better choices, new pasta ideas, penne with vodka sauce??? Really ??? Its not 1985, create something. There are,100's of resources in the industry, reach out, reach up be something better."}
{"text":"Came for dinner on a Friday night at 8:30.  Service was on point and Friday night Mules were $6 so the price of a cocktail was cheaper than wine. Decor in the restaurant was cool to look at as it shows the history of Pittsburgh. This old house was once a family store turned restaurant.

The fa Diablo was amazing and the crab bisque was pretty tasty too. Hope to visit again and sit out on the patio for dinner.

Overall, a very good dinner and for $60 for 2 it was a great price."}
{"text":"I'm a regular customer. Usually great service and food. This evening was an exception. The server had no idea what was going on. The special was Smothered chicken for Retro Tuesday. He had no idea what this was. He then said no sides came with this meal they were an extra charge. After we ordered something else the people at the next table challenged this and they received the chicken with 2 sides. This ruined our dinner as the chicken was why we choose to dine there. Server training needed"}
{"text":"Came in late night during Light the Night, just for for drinks and a snack. Service was fast, but the salad and cup of soup were disappointing. The chopped salad had weird cheap ingredients like celery and carrot. I was excited about the crab bisque, but they must have been running low and it must have been half sherry because it tasted like I was taking a shot of cheap white wine with every bite. Hope the dinner fare is better."}
{"text":"We drive past Atria's every day, yet the reviews somehow held us away. On a whim, we decided to go to Atria's for Valentine's day. Yikes, poor move. I'm pretty easy, I can get down with the dollar menu at McDonalds. However, I am familiar and experienced with casual, casual fine dining. and upper end fine dining. On to the impressions:

Immediately pulled into the parking lot to see a truck heading straight for me. I squeezed between people standing in the snow and the vehicle coming towards me. I asked the valet if there was a separate entrance, but he assured me that I came in the correct way - the reason it is mandatory valet only. Sadly, the Valet was one of the high points of the night. We walk in to a friendly host, whom told us about the history of the restaurant while we waited - very nice. He also recommended informing our waiter that it was our first time for a free app - again, nice touch. The place looked like a cool spot to grab a drink or two... not a good meal. Upon being seated for the rest of our \"dinner\" my impressions were confirmed.

We were seated in a booth in the bar room next to the kitchen exit. Not what I would expect with a reservation, esp without being asked, but sure. I immediately informed out waiter that we would have the coursed \"Sweetheart Dinner\" - Cocktail, Salad, Surf and Turf, and Dessert. After a few minutes our cocktail arrived a Kir Royal. Not a bad drink, but nothing special. As our drinks came out, the Chef brought out a free App - Fried Zucchini - my favorite part of the meal. The salads came out fairly quickly, which was also pretty good.  We waited with empty plates for some time, while employees walked past us, not bothering to clear our plates for about 10 minutes.  Now the fun began - After waiting for quite some time without food or drinks - a major no, no with a coursed meal - our food came out. The touted steaks were about 3-4 ounces and burnt black. I asked for mine medium rare and my date asked for medium well. Mine was generously described as medium well (grey with light pink center) and my date's was not edible (burnt and charred exterior with a fully grey and tough interior). Both of our mini steaks tasted like ash. The lobster was like rubber... awful impression to leave for a date that had never had lobster (Had to promise to make the meal myself or go somewhere reputable soon). To my server's credit, I was eventually able to flag him down and get the steaks replaced with properly cooked ones, though equally miniature. Between the horrible food, slow service, we mercifully were able to flag down our server, and get our dessert boxed and check to go. The damage for the \"sweetheart dinner\" - two cocktails, a good side salad, an awful tiny \"filet\" and terrible lobster (I've never said terrible and lobster together :/ ), and two additional drinks (Captain Diet and a Beer) 110 (130 inc tip). We most definitely wont be back. Seriously, I wish I took pictures, this was a comically bad experience."}
{"text":"Group Luncheon at Atria's was excellent!

Booking an after-funeral luncheon at Atria's was easy. One initial phone call. A quick look at their website menu options. Confirming phone call. That's it.

The area was ready when we arrived. Completely setup. Looked nice.

Guests \"inhaled\" the fruit and cheese provided. Orders were promptly taken... preprinted menu choices made that process very easy. 

Beverages were offered, and refills were prompt.

Oh, yeah: food! Excellent. Taste? That is why we selected Atria's in the first place.

No restaurant can survive on food alone. It is really all about the staff; the people who make it happen... front and back of the house. Everyone was very professional, courteous and friendly. All worked hard. Very hard.

My wife and I have always enjoyed our visits to Atria's Restaurant and Tavern, so we were happy to provide an opportunity for many friends and relatives to share the Atria's dining experience.

Visit. Interact with the servers. Have a good time. (And enjoy an ice-cold glass of beer!)"}
{"text":"Went to Atrias for lunch today. Service was slow for soup and a salad. Cup of soup was $4.99 and a side salad served in a large-rimmed bowl was $9.99! With a coke, lunch was $20. Apparently they just changed the menu and dramatically increased the prices on everything. Food was ok but definitely not worth the price."}
{"text":"We went here after a Pirates game. Maybe not our best move but we were hungry. 

The staff was not that friendly. Probably because they were working all day of a game. We got drinks were the glasses were cracked almost all the way around. 
It was not cleanest either. 

2 of us ordered the chicken parm and it's a mixed bag. My friend thought it was pretty good with good flavor and a nice side of pasta. I thought it was sauce and cheese gravy to cover a low quality piece of chicken and the pasta was terrible. 

The kids liked the meatballs but mostly left the pasta untouched.

{"text":"My issues with several different Atria's are well chronicled & it all started with this one. I would never have gone back to another Atria's except our niece gave us a gift card for Christmas. We went to the one in Pleasant Hills & it had been a far better experience than I'd ever had at an Atria's. I sent an e-mail to their website about all of my experiences & praising the Pleasant Hills Location. I received an e-mail back from the manager of the Mt. Lebanon location requesting that I call him. We spoke for about 20 minutes & I explained what it was about this location that I didn't like. He was nice enough to invited my wife & I down for a visit.

They more than made up for any issues I had. The service was great. I had the Char Grilled Meatloaf & it was terrific. It came with jalapeno chedder cornbread that I would crawl on my hands & knees through a blizzard for.

Once again; Mr. Dearolf, thank you. We will be back."}
{"text":"This apparently was the first Atria's and thus is more old-fashioned than the other locations. 

Anyway, you have to go there for Oktoberfest! They have a special menu for this. For lunch recently, I had the Sauerbraten entree, which was phenomenal! You get really tender braised beef with raisins with spatzle noodles, a sweet/sour gravy, and red cabbage. Sooo good. This is why I love german food! Also (and just for Oktoberfest) had were their fresh baked pretzels with awesome honey mustard, A scrumptious (I don't care if it's an overused word, screw the haters) Black Forest Cherry Cake, and some on-the-house Bratwurst (the head chef brought it to us himself since it was our first time there). Atria's rules."}
{"text":"We came here with a friend before a show at Stage AE, and had a great dinner. Their steak is terrific as are their bbq pork quesadillas. Desserts are all amazing too (i recommend the peanut butter mousse). We've been to 3 Atria's so far, and they've all been good, but this was the best. Cool decor and great service too."}
{"text":"ATRIA's OCTOBER FEST serves up great food during the fall.  Great atmosphere coupled with authentic German classics.  
If you like authentic German food you'll love ATRIA's October Fest!"}
{"text":"The food is great and the service is wonderful. The server was so polite and always had our glasses filled. I had the stacked meat loaf and it was to die for!"}
{"text":"Located right next to PNC Park, so is a decent place to get a beer and some grub prior to game day. That and outdoor seating are main perks. Otherwise, food and prices are not worth a stop. This place will fill up on game day, but should be avoided when the Pirates aren't in town. It isn't a BAD experience. If you are siting outside and you have a view of Pittsburgh, it can't be that bad."}
{"text":"My husband and I met friends for lunch today to catch-up.  We moved away from the area a year ago and selected this favorite place for our lunch.  We talked a lot, however, we were not overly loud for their lunch crowd.  As we were leaving a couple of our six people, mentioned that we got very dirty looks from our waitress and the hostess.  They also mentioned how long it took us to get served.  After placing our order, we went 45 minutes before our lunch came.  I just can't imagine being treated that way.  I doubt we will ever return, and we plan a return trip in October to Pittsburgh!  Crab bisque and Crab cakes were not as good as I remembered.  After our meal was served, we were never approached by our waitress for about an hour.  This was mid week and 11:30 AM - 2:30 PM."}
{"text":"They were very friendly however, food was slow coming out.  The staff apologized and took off our appetizer which was nice.  The table beside us came in after us and was throwing a fit about their food not coming out so they took more off their bill.  We were there for a game so  there was a time crunch.  The food was very good (burgers) and we will go back. We'll just get there earlier."}
{"text":"POT ROAST NACHOS! Best nachos ever, hands down. You must try them.

The Atria's menu has something for everyone (I like the burgers) and they decorate the place charmingly at Christmastime. Their wine by the glass pours are good and they offer a decent variety. The place has an honest neighborhood feel and is a comfy casual place that is great for a family meal, but also good for a non-pretentious date spot.

Did I mention the pot roast nachos???"}
{"text":"Just heard that this Atria's is closing today.... I'm going to miss the most amazing Sherry Crab Bisque..."}
{"text":"Great pee Pirates game food, great outdoor seating. Best burger I have had in a long time."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, although the temperature was slightly cold when it arrived.  Portions could have been larger.  But all in all, it was a nice place, good food, good service.  We will be back."}
{"text":"\"Meh\" is right, I'm not quite sure what people like about this place.  It's so below average that I have no clue what the attraction is.  I initially went to Atria's b/c of all the hype and then I realized something, it's all hype - there is no substance to the hype.  The food was blah, the atmosphere was blah, the service was blah.  Maybe \"Meh\" isn't the right word - let's go with \"Blah\" for Atria's.  

There are so many places in and around Pittsburgh that are so much better so do yourself a favor and try one of those other places!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here today for the first time. The food was average with small portion sizes for the price. Also they fresh cut fries were soggy so they were probably held under a heat lamp to long.  It had a nice atmosphere with great service. Our waitress really made it a nice afternoon. She was attentive, friendly and informative."}
{"text":"Very cool older building with a lot of character.  I loved that they had free valet parking.  The restaurant was very busy but they squeezed in our party of 8 at the last minute.  Everyone loved their meals.  It was huge hit.  The staff are top notch.  We loved everything about this place."}
{"text":"We used to really enjoy Atria's food, atmosphere, and service.  During our last few visits, we have noticed a decline in the quality of all three.  Last night, we had reservations (which the restaurant called to confirm) to enjoy the Oktoberfest menu.   We were seated almost 30 minutes after our reservation time, but it appeared that some walk-ins were seated ahead of us. Our waitress, Cheryl, was great and did her best but the bar and kitchen were extremely slow.  One person in our party waited 20 minutes for their drink from the bar. When the food arrived after almost 40 minutes, it was lukewarm."}
{"text":"Stopped in here with the hubs for a late lunch one day. The place was not busy at all, just a handful of tables and no one at the bar. We had to wait several minutes for one of the two female bartenders to seat us, although like I said, there was no one at the bar. They were busy chatting while we stood there like morons. When one of the ladies finally did come over to seat us, she was friendly. We asked to sit at a booth, so she directed us to the dining room. 

Our waiter came out and took our order fairly quickly. My husband got a reuben and fries, which is his go-to. I ordered a crab cake sandwich and coleslaw. I questioned why there was also a crab cake with fries and cole slaw on the menu for the same price, and was told that the bun, lettuce and tomato takes the place of one of the sides. Okay weird but whatever I didn't want fries anyway. Our food came out pretty fast, but it should have since they weren't busy. The food was okay, but lacking for the price. My crab cake was good, but not even the size of the bun. And for $16.99, it should have been a lot bigger. Cole slaw was average. My husband said his reuben was good, but definitely not the best he ever had and the one he had at the Atria's by PNC was way better. Service was also lacking. For not being busy, our waiter was definitely not present enough. He did refill our drinks once, when they were completely empty. Also, he did not once ever ask how our meals were. Bill, with tip, came to around $40 - not worth it. Won't return anytime soon. 2 1/2 stars"}
{"text":"This was my first experience at Atria's. Our group of six stopped here for dinner prior to the ballgame Monday night. Our waitress cleaned off a table for us and took our drink order, while another waitress grabbed more chairs and brought us menus. Since we stayed a little longer than anticipated at our previous location, we only had about 45-50 minutes to order and eat before the Pirates game started. Someone in our party mentioned this to our waitress and she said that she could take care of us quickly (although it was our fault for being tardy, of course).

I, along with another friend, ordered the Bucco Louis' Grilled Chicken Sandwich with honey dijon, lettuce, tomato, swiss cheese, pineapple, and carmelized onions. (I left the pineapple off of mine). You have the choice of fries or homemade potato chips...I got the fries. My husband and another person in our party chose the Raise The Jolly Reuben. Someone else got the Ball Park Burger, and another the Angus Beef Sliders. Our food arrived promptly and everyone's plates looked very good. I am not a fan of Reuben's, but even my husband's food looked tasty. My chicken sandwich and fries were good. The only complaint was that the top of my bun looked buttered (it had this glossy look to it) and was a little soggy. Everyone agreed that their meals were good.

Our waitress was extremely friendly and efficient. We told her that one of the members of our group was from Ohio...and obviously not a Pittsburgh sports fan. Although, he was adventurous enough to come PNC anyway. She joked around with us, and was extremely easy going and social with us, making our visit very enjoyable. We come down to PNC a few times a season to catch a game and would definitely consider stopping here again next time."}
{"text":"This is a great place for small and large groups.  Great drink selection, the draft beer selection was pretty weak but the have a decent selection of beer in a bottle.  

The food is very good.  I had the smokehouse platter.  The ribs were very good. The platter also comes with smothered chicken   It was awesome.  I felt the chicken was the highlight of the plate.  Hand cut fries were good also.  I give this a big thumbs up."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Atrias..give most of my business to the Pleasant Hills location who, in my opinion..gets everything right..I guess, after eating at the Beverly Road location..all Atrias aren't equal. This was my second time at this location..and I agree with another reviewer..being put in the small room with one other table of diners was awkward..to say the least..there's no atmosphere and your conversations are heard by all..the backroom off the bar is no better..the Pleasant Hills location is the Taj Mahal compared to this one. Hubby ordered the pork chop and asked for it well done ( served raw in the middle) and my fish was awful ( thin and bought, I'm assuming, prebreaded.) I own a restaurant where our fish is hand breaded..the difference is like daylight and dark. Our server, who I'm hoping was new, didn't know the menu nor wines at all.  All in all, not a \"that was delicious, we'll be back experience\"..won't return until they get new chefs."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in our lunch today. Fish tacos were disgusting. My husband took one bite and spit it out. I should have done the same as I am now paying for eating it. Not sure if the sauce was bad or the fish. I didn't want to wait for something else and I feel bad sending food back. My husband got the pot roast which he said was very good. I don't know if we'll ever go there again. Disappointed..."}
{"text":"Very sub par. Definitely doesn't have turbo tap because it takes forever to get a beer. Also the ticket times are way too long. It shouldn't take 45 minutes to fry some chicken. Overall would not recommend."}
{"text":"This is one of our go-to spots because it's close and the food is decent. The service is hit or miss, though! John is awesome and the Octoberfest menu would keep us coming back anyway! Good happy hour deals, too."}
{"text":"The service was very good and I have no issue with that. Portion size is my issue. I ordered beef medallions with grilled shrimp. My meal consisted of 3 shrimp (normal size 1 bite each) and 2 tiny pieces of beef, not what I was expecting. Other people in my party had what I would consider normal sized portions and kept trying to offer me some of their good. The salads you add to you order are larger than what I was served. Thank god there were other places around as I had to stop to get dinner after over paying for a meal that most appetizers are larger than."}
{"text":"Food was fine, prices on most things within reason, house wine is inexpensive and drinkable.  Went early to avoid the rush, ended up waiting 50 min. between when our order was placed and when we were served.  Waitstaff did not check in  nearly enough during those 50 min.  However, when the food finally came and one of the orders was wrong, they made the change and did not charge us for the dish."}
{"text":"Chain restaurants, whether they be local or national, always worry me. I never think I'm going to actually enjoy them. A few weeks ago was my mother's birthday. She is a pretty picky eater who would much prefer a super burger from eat n' park than going to any fancy restaurant. Atria's was a good happy medium. The staff was so wonderful. Before even knowing that there was a birthday at the table, the manager came over with complimentary fried zucchini. I'm not big on fried foods but these were good. Even better because they were free. I didn't order an appetizer because of the free treats given to us by the manager but I did give into the advertisement of their crab cakes being the best in town. The crab cakes came with a parmesan risotto and grilled asparagus. I don't eat crab cakes a lot but I would imagine that the advertisement wasn't far from true. They were amazing! It was an extremely pleasant and surprising experience and my mom had a great birthday!"}
{"text":"Great dinner, nice food and very nice owners! They came to the table and made sure everything was alright! Good was very good - service, mediocre."}
{"text":"Lori our server was awsum !! Food was great recommend asking for her as a server ,the fingerling potatoes are to dye for"}
{"text":"I really wasn't thrilled with our meal here. The service was fine, although a bit slow for a not-so-busy Wednesday night. We started with the breaded zucchini, which was about 90% breading, 10% zucchini. The breading was much too heavy and you could barely taste the vegetable.

I had the parmesan crusted chicken with pasta, which seemed to be coated in the same breading they used on the zucchini, still too heavy and altogether flavorless. The chicken was cooked perfectly though, it just needed some spices and salt and pepper for goodness sake. The pasta was cooked well and the sauce was fine though. My husband was not thrilled with his pasta primavera, which was, strangely enough, very spicy (though the server did warn us about this beforehand, to her credit) and again, not much flavor and many of the veggies not cooked thoroughly."}
{"text":"Love Love Love Atria's Happy Hour.  Good food, great drink specials and a fun atmosphere to unwind with friends after work!"}
{"text":"Came here after a rainy and long pirates game and had some great food along with just as great service"}
{"text":"Not vegan-friendly. Animal products are in all the vegetable side dishes, except for the french fries."}
{"text":"This place was actually a house and I love it.  It's up scale yet homie and the service is more then kind.  Me and my beau went during happy hour, which is only downstairs but our waitress let us sit upstairs away from the crowd.  Appetizers were half priced along with most alcohol. 

We started with my beau's favorite Calamari and I ordered grilled vegetables. One word, perfect. Both were light and pleasant and didn't fill us up to to much. The portion size was def. enough for more then just the 2 of us but remember the Calmari was his FAVORITE. I ordered a moscato along with it while he had a simple beer. 

For dinner I had the waitress pick for me while my beau tried the Chicken Fresco.  The Chicken Fresco came with their homemade marinara and a balsamic glaze.  Not impressed, to plain for me but I grew up eating nothing but ethnic and flavor riched food.  The beau thought the same.  I was surprised with the Tri Tortellini and was happy. The pinenuts gave this plate exactly what it needed but it's nothing I couldn't make at home. 

The wait was a bit long for dinner because of our waitress and chef miscommunicating and we ended up with a free dessert!   We picked the strawberry wontons. When it came out the plate looked so pretty!!! But not with three wontons and a scoop of ice cream... Def a dessert for one not two. Needless to say it was very very good. I can say this dish was the best part of the experience. 

Overall, 4 out of 5 because the flavors are for people who are used to that style of cooking... I come from an ethnic family so flavors are a big deal to me!

{"text":"Having lived near this Atria's location in the past, I can say that I've spent more than my fair share of time at the PNC Park Atria's. My wife and I stopped in this past week, and for me, I was reminded of why I enjoy Atria's...but this having been our first time at Atria's together, and witnessing my wife's experience, I realized why the place could garner such low reviews.

For someone like myself, who's actually had enough positive and negative food experiences at Atria's to know exactly what to order and what to steer clear of, I can make the experience a positive one, but that's a situation I'm afforded now thanks to my previous patience and convenience. My wife, opting to stray from my suggestions had an awful dinner. Her plate of bland fish and asparagus left her turned off completely. Luckily, we were using a gift card, so it wasn't as frustrating for her as it could've been. Regardless, walking away from an entire plate of food is disheartening.

That led me to realize this: If you're only at Atria's once, you're odds aren't that great of having a good experience. That's just the reality of the situation. There are a handful of really good things on the menu that I LOVE. The parmesan crusted chicken is really good, although it can sometimes be a little too oily. The pot roast is excellent, but it's way too heavy for most of the year...ESPECIALLY during baseball season when they're busier. Their chili is really on-point...especially paired with their bread, and the salmon salad is excellent. Although, I don't like the salmon, so I swap the salmon for chicken for a great salad option. The carrot cake is insanely good, but truth be told, it's not homemade. I could care less, though, as it's still some of the best carrot cake I've ever eaten. Period. Other notable items are the pot roast nachos, crab cakes, red skin smashed potatoes, and the reuben.

That's really where the positives end, though. I've learned to steer clear of the burgers because of the inconsistency with which they're prepared. I've received more undercooked burgers at Atria's than any other restaurant, and it's just not worth the gamble anymore. My filets have always been perfectly-prepared, but the one time I got a strip it was practically burned on one side and undercooked on the other. Failing to cook burgers and steaks correctly isn't that surprising, but deciding to serve them to customers despite their incorrect preparation IS surprising...and poor.

I know that the last time I had salmon on my salad, the fish tasted \"off\" and I paid the price for it later. I've never given a single fish meal a chance there since (we're talking years now). Hence, my request for chicken on my salads now. Most of the meals that I've had are average, and I've practically tried the entirety of the menu over the years, so believe me when I say it.

Why do I continue to go? Well, because the few items that I do love, are crave-worthy, and having become a regular (less so, nowadays), the service that I received at the bar was always excellent. Daniel and Roy have always provided  great service to me, and good service goes the distance, as far I'm concerned, so it's been worth stopping in from time-to-time. Unfortunately, if I can't sit at the bar, I don't always stick around, as the service at the tables is really hit-or-miss. For every good server they have, they have two more that could care less about their jobs...especially during peak times.

Regardless, this is my favorite Atria's location, because it's the least \"stuffy\" and pretentious location of them all, but there's still a lot of room to improve...and I hope it does."}
{"text":"I decided to check out downtown Pittsburgh on my trip for a family visit recently. We took a walk around the area and this location caught our eye. It had outdoor seating and was right outside of PNC Park. We decided on the Pot Roast nachos as an appetizer. It was pretty good. Nice chunks of Pot Roast and various cheeses. I than decided on the Atria combo which had andouille sausage, Perogies, Chicken and Sauerkraut. I figured that this would be something different. The sausage was great and so were the perogies. I did not care for the chicken too much. It was dark meat with bread crumbs. I prefer white meat so that was probably the reason. I also tasted my friends steak  hoagie. I am from the area so I have had better. It was a little dry and not enough cheese and onions. The outdoors ambiance was great! Pittsburgh has a great downtown. Nothing like Detroit. It was alive, various things to do and was a beautiful city. Overall the restaurant was a good experience. The waiter was great and funny also. We also talked to some people sitting beside us. it made for a good time. However, I would opt for another place when I visit again."}
{"text":"We were in town for the day and wanted to grab a local bite. I am so glad we stopped in. The food was excellent, the service was too.

The ribs were out of this world...zesty, smoky and everything I was looking for.

The peanut butter mousse pie was a prefect finish to a fantastic meal.

If I had any critique it would be about the crab soup...high on flavor, but where was the crab?"}
{"text":"STAY AWAY...
We've been 3 times over the past few years, each time we say \"let's try it again\" followed by \"wish we'd done something else\".

Reminds me of the movie line \"Run away, run very far away\"

Last nite after Steelers/Jets was last straw. I hope the owner or general manager reads this. And think the health department should too.

Service is mediocre and slow. consistently. Waitress was ok in attitude.

After our soup starter (good french onion soup) we waited and waited and waited and waited for our mains. Noticing us staring at her, waitress stopped by, went into kitchen, came back and said we were next. my watch said 8:31. Then her manager came by and argued with me and said we were next, then at 8:52pm the horrible food finally arrived. That's 21 minutes to be next. In that time we watched 4 tables turn from being seated to drinks to mains to check down while we waited for our main. 

Manager embarrassed himself. Said they were busy and working our food and he had checked and would come soon. I told him about the 4 tables turning and he said no they didn't. then I said I used to manage restaurants and know what customer service and ticket times are and he challenged me and said no I didn;t and I had no idea what I was talking about. What an idiot! First rule of restaurant business is the customer is always right.

Then the food arrived. How hard is it to do chicken marsala with mushrooms, seriously? It was two soggy fried chicken tenders from the deep fryer (not pan sauteed) over a bowl of bowtie pasta with shrooms and a sauce. While the sauce did have some marsala in it, it was full of sour cream and tasted like stroganoff and a little funny. The Penne ala vodka was sauteed canned tomatoes and no flavor. We were so hungry we ate most and left.

1 hour later I was sick on the side of the road from the dinner and still feel really rough this morning."}
{"text":"Atria's is a local chain of nine restaurants serving American comfort foods, this location living just outside of PNC Park on Pittsburgh's North Shore. Founded by an Italian immigrant initially as a grocery store and then a post-prohibition watering hole in the 1930s, Atria's has become one of the city's popular culinary institutions if popularity is measured by the number of mouths the chain has fed over the years. With a menu featuring what a Californian like me would consider to be \"convincing-sounding\" Pittsburgh-y dishes such as \"Pot Roast Nachos,\" \"Tortellini Alfredo,\" and \"Black and Gold Pierogis,\" this was one of my initial introductions into how locals eat in the self-proclaimed \"City of Champions.\" While I would eventually find much more interesting food in Pittsburgh, I still consider this the best place to eat in the cluster of restaurants and taverns near the ballpark on Federal Street, an area that I've often traveled to for work over the past couple of years, and hence I've had many lunch meals at Atria's whether it be solo, with colleagues, or with my client.

The spot is a comfortable place to eat, especially when the weather is nice enough to sit out front. Service is friendly and accurate, though not engaging. Portions are large, but this is not \"clean\" food. There are layers of sauces, gravies, and cheese on many things, covering for lower-quality meats, seafood, and produce. Atria's does the simple things well enough -- their chili being an example. Moderately spicy, theirs is an aggressively \"beefy\" chili with just a small amount of beans, sprinkled with shredded cheddar jack, and crowned by corn tortilla chips -- it is probably my favorite menu item. They also do a good burger, well-sized, good char on the surface and cooked to your preference, served with a standard condiment mix of mayo, mustard, pickles, lettuce, onions, and tomato. Atria's is in the business of making food, not miracles.

Occasionally, you'll see something interesting and off-beat being offered as a special. This was the case earlier this year when Atria's was serving an Oktoberfest menu in June. I ordered the enormous Schweinshaxe (aka pork shank) which was served with two hearty sides: skin-on mashed potatoes and spaetzle, not to mention gravy. Despite the \"Cheesecake Factory\"-level portions, I came away a little disappointed. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the velvety softness and succulence of the pork -- but everything else was just a bit \"off.\" The gravy was too sweet. The potatoes were under-seasoned. The spaetzle, bizarrely mixed with saurkraut, was soggy and over-cooked. Such is the result when this restaurant tries to be ambitious.

I wouldn't recommend anyone go out of their way to dine at Atria's, but this is a place where getting a good-quality meal is a possibility if you choose wisely. You won't be disappointed if you stick with the simpler dishes here, and you should look for the items that have obviously been on their menu for decades.

{"text":"We stopped in after going to the Andy Warhol museum. I had been wanting to try it when I attended a Pirates games but I never got the chance. I must say, I'm glad I did. I had the fish tacos and they were excellent. The server was good and the location is great. Give them a try."}
{"text":"I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could. Food is usually pretty good. I've had the ribs here which were better than average. Reuben and burgers are always good. I usually get the southwest chicken salad with the peanut dressing. This weekend it was just ok.. The lettuce was a little limp and just soaked in dressing. Normally I'd say there wasn't enough.. Anyways it just wasn't great. Had to ask for bread which came out a little stale. Service was actually decent but they were slow since there wasn't a game. So it's \"good\" not great. The Atria's in Mt Lebanon is much better though in my opinion"}
{"text":"I ordered an Atria' salad with Poppyseed dressing. Their salads are delicious! It had bacon and egg which is a great value for $4.99. I also ordered the \"hand cut\" french fries with NO SALT!  The waiter/ manager even repeated my order when I came to pick it up emphasizing fries with NO SALT!  When I got my fries they were double dipped with salt? There is an obvious disconnect between the order taker and the kitchen help:-(. They're celebrating anniversary which means that their delicious fried zucchini is not on the menu:-(. Fried Zucchini will be back in June. Parking is valet so park elsewhere and walk."}

I actually really enjoyed the food here.

I'm not a pierogi fan, but my sweetie said they were really good and got them both times we were here.

Great pricing, great service, better than average food and a great location.

Yup... we'll be here again... hopefully during playoffs!!!!"}
{"text":"Well, everything is just grand in Pittsburgh when the October weather is so beautiful!! But we had a great 'lil Saturday lunch here at Atria's after walking our new puppy around the North Shore. They have plenty of outdoor tables (in the shade) and we grabbed a corner one with our pup. They were totally cool about it, and offered water, etc. The bf was starving per usual, so he started with the crab bisque, which he said was \"awesome\". He also had their spicy pasta entree, while I opted for a fresh house chopped salad and a glass of pinot grigio. The salad was super fresh, and they didn't skimp on any of the \"good veggies\". Only gripe is, I asked for no crumbled bleu cheese, and it came out with it. I didn't feel like complaining, so just picked it off. The salad definitely would have been more enjoyable for me without it (I don't eat cheese) but it was a nice size salad for the cost. It was also an Oktoberfest special, so bf got the Dunkel brew to drink. Our waitress was really nice and all in all, it was a good experience. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I feel bad about giving this place such a meh review but every time I go that's exactly how I feel when I leave. Atria's is one of those places that I've never had any type of memorable service experience or food experience for that matter.

I can't say the food is bad, but it's not really great either. I will say the service is always so. It's almost as if they don't realize you have other places to go; you can just sit at their restaurant all day. On the upside the busboy's and girls are hounding your table filling your water glass after taking a sip. So if you're a horse you won't go thirsty.

Honestly though. you are better off eating the park. I mean who doesn't love Manny's BBQ?"}
{"text":"Never Disappointed.  A usual stop for us, recently my husband and I shared an early dinner there on New Years Eve.  The staff was warm and friendly, they work well with each other.

Consistently great food, interresting menu that features seasonal dishes.you have got to try the pot roast nachos!"}
{"text":"I really don't see what the buzz is about with Atria. I found that our waitress was pretty rude and it was the kind of food you can get anywhere. They do have vegetarian options and the portions are shareable. Probably won't be back unless we have to meet people and I don't have a say in where we go."}
{"text":"It's not a trip to Atria's without trying their world class ribs! Portions were large and their chopped salad was the best I've had in a long time. Ribs were magnificent...although the chicken on my sampler platter was a tad dry. The coffee was outstanding and the perfect accompaniment to an amazing slice of carrot cake shared by two!  Our server, Anita made our dining experience more than pleasurable...she is a true asset to this fine establishment!"}
{"text":"Went with a friend on a busy Friday night. There were two rehearsal dinners. We waited about 30 minutes to be seated. Our waiter was very friendly and gave good suggestions for drinks and dinner. 

We started with the fried macaroni and cheese as an appetizer. They were very flavorful and quite rich. My friend enjoyed her chocolate martini. Unfortunately the power went out before our dinner arrived. After about 30 minutes we decided to settle our bill and head out. 

I recommend this restaurant. Wide variety of good options."}
{"text":"Visited for the MCG Holiday Jazz event and this place exceeded my expectations on all levels -- food, service, ambience, and entertainment.

Food:  We ordered a small cheese platter.  The chef actually came out and explained the cheeses on our plate.  Nice touch, though I have to admit to not necessarily knowing which cheese went with which explanation.  Nonetheless, all were quite tasty and better than I would have imagined a simple cheese platter would be.  

I ordered fish tacos which were quite tasty and my husband ordered the pork tenderloin, the Novemberfest special, which was also tasty from the bite I acquired from him, as were the squash bites I \"stole\".  

Service:  Greeted immediately upon arrival and ushered to our table right away, despite being very early for our reservations.  Offered drinks as soon as we arrived at our table and our server was always there when needed but not pushy when we weren't in need.

Ambience:  We sat in the small dining area next to the bar and near the stage.  Cozy, quaint, warm feel to it.  Nice venue to hear the jazz band while still being able to carry on a quiet conversation.

Entertainment:  I've been trying to like jazz for awhile now and not all that successfully.  Last night was a winner for jazz band quality and for the vocalist's quality.  Very nice, indeed."}
{"text":"I've had great meals here (steak salad) and I've had some okay meals here (bacon wrapped pork medallions). It's fine for a quick dinner (it's near our house) and their drinks are always great. But the food doesn't appear to be super fresh or cooked from scratch. The service is always great, however - super fast and friendly. We have some gift cards to use and will go back for that reason."}

{"text":"BEST CRAB BISQUE IN U.S!!!!!!!!!!!

Kept going back daily while in P town getting giant cup of it...wow...its unbelievable."}
{"text":"Atrias is known for their crab bisque, pot roast nachos and house made chips. ALL of them are delicious!  Their fish tacos are really good and really spicy. In fact they even come with a chipotle sour cream. I have had a couple if their pasta dishes and a couple if their salads and they did not disappoint. Prices compare to Applebee's or Chili's but the food is fresh and of better quality. There is an open view to the kitchen so you can see the chef and the assistants prepare the meals. The environment is welcoming-being slightly low lit. The decor is contemporary with a mix of lights and darks. The wait staff is outstanding. They not only wait on their own tables but woks an empty dish off your table if they see one. The servers know their menu and have nice recommendations as to what to order if needed. I recommend saving room for carrot cake!"}
{"text":"There are a couple of Atria restaurants in our area. We've been to this location the most. Tonight my husband and I were meeting young couple for dinner. The dining room was closed off for a private party so we sat in the bar area. 
For dinner I ordered Chicken Piccata. It came with smashed Red Russet potatoes, and asparagus. The chicken was tender and the asparagus was nicely done, but the potatoes were bland. My husband had the Chicken Pot Pie. This is not your Swanson chicken pot pie. This was made from scratch and almost as big as a dinner plate. It was toasted nicely and the pastry was flaky. My husband ate most if it but left some if the pastry shell. The young couple ordered the Pot Roast Nachos. It sounds a little weird but if you go to Atria's you should definitely try them.  This is not your momma's pot roast. It is cooked in sherry and it gives it a unique taste. Put that on top of nachos and it's like a marriage made in heaven. For dessert we all shared a piece if Lemoncello Cake. Normally I am a chocolate fan but this cake was light and airy with just enough lemon flavor that wasn't overpowering. It had shaved white chocolate on too and a raspberry drizzle. It was definitely our favorite part if the meal. 
We had great service and great food which makes for a great night."}

{"text":"This is a go to spot for me because the food is always on point. I've been many times and have never had a bad meal. I've also never had bad service. They have outside seating and offer free valet parking which is always a plus. They change their menu a bit which is nice to have a different variety of options but I was absolutely in love with their Greek salad and now I can't get it! So that's the one con...if you like something on the menu they may not have it the next time you go. The chopped salad...OMG it's a must every time...best side salad ever. Crab bisque is another must, always delicious. I recently had the seafood risotto special and it did not disappoint, huge portion! I tried the strawberry Bellini and can't wait to go back and get another. If you're looking for a great dinner with a wonderful atmosphere Atria's is the place to go!"}

Carpet could definitely be replaced. We were seated upstairs which was nice, with light from a coupe of windows. Wait staff was very attentive snd friendly. Good sense of humor. 
For drinks we both ordered the Honey Mule. Jim Beam Honey whiskey with ginger ale and lime. Very good. 
We had Sherry Crab soup to start. Sherry was the predominant flavor but still very good. We ordered 2 entrees to shared. Father's Day Filet Kabob with grilled veg. My friend ordered it medium. I prefer rare or medium rare but to my surprise it was delicious, very tender and tasty. I will be ordering a steak next time. And the Spicy Shrimp De Frivola with stuffed banana peppers. Penne pasta with just enough spicy kick. Was delicious. 
Will definitely be back for the service and fantastic food."}

Highlight of the meal was THE BEST sherry crab bisque I have ever tasted. Will go back for sure!"}

{"text":"Although my meat was dry, the food overall was delicious: my chicken breast smothered in mushrooms and onions with cheddar jack cheese, the homemade chips, and my wife's \"Pittsburgher\" kielbassi slices with pierogies, sour cream, sauerkraut, and mustard.  We were not brought or offered bread.  What brought down this rating was service problems which obviously were not the fault of our server.  I appreciated that the restaurant offered me a reservation when Open Table indicated that nothing was available on this day. The hostess did not seem to know how to handle a reservation and I do not believe that our arrival was matched to it. She asked another individual for assistance and I believe that person told her simply to seat us. After more than ten minutes had passed after we were seated without a server coming to the table, the hostess came over to ask if she could take a drink order.  She was not able to answer my question about whether the featured beers were draft or bottled.  Soon thereafter, our server, a charming and gracious young man, came to take the drink order.  We asked him to take our dinner order as well, given that this was stacking up to be a very lengthy meal.  More than fifteen minutes later, our entrees came, but no sign of my wife's wine and my beer.  I asked the young man who brought the food about our drinks and a few minutes later, our server came over, apologized, and told us how backed up the bar was.  He graciously told us that the drinks would be complimentary.  We received them more than five minutes after the arrival of our entrees.  These were not mixed drinks requiring anything special to dispense, simply beverages that had to be poured.  For almost the entire time we were there, a band was playing inside at a volume that was deafening.  We could not possibly have had our meal inside near the band as it would have been necessary to use sign language to converse and to order. We were seated outside as far away from the music as possible, yet it was still difficult to speak to each other over the din.  Additionally, the placement of the band in a small room makes it particularly difficult to snake in and out when coming in to use the restroom. The menu at this Atria's is a bit different from the traditional locations and some of the prices are not the same for items that are identical.  The homemade chips are $2.99 at traditional Atria's locations, $3.99 at PNC Park for a smaller portion."}
{"text":"I must be the minority who thinks this is way overrated.  For such a \"classy high end\" establishment you would think a server could handle more than 2 tables on a Sunday afternoon (3pm). It took over a half hour for nachos then my entree salad and husbands side salad came out together. 2 minutes later his entree came out. Horrible timing, slow, meal wasn't prepared as requested.  I could understand if they were slammed but literally maybe 5 tables occupied.  I also don't like how they restructured the salads on the menu with paying for a base then paying to add protein etc. At least side salads are now included with pasta dishes, but really they should be included if you order steak etc, too."}
{"text":"My fam has been going here for years now, and it always delivers. The atmosphere is cute and cozy, with fun decorations adorning the walls. The bar area is super comfortable, and the various small dining rooms are all unique. The food is good, definitely consistent.... and the staff are all really warm and professional. Actually some of them have worked there for years and years. I like it. A solid neighborhood establishment."}
{"text":"Atria's is always a solid choice of somewhere to go to eat, but I was a little disappointed by the portion sizes of my meal when I came out here the other day.  Two things really struck me and stuck with me.  First off, I ordered a side of spinach, and it was almost $3, and it really had barely anything in the bowl.  Don't get me wrong, it was delicious, but very minuscule.  Also, for my salad I decided I didn't want the extra fruit and tortilla strips in it, so it came out as requested, however, after I requested to not have the extra things, I found my plate to be extremely small compared to my mother and grandmas.  Come on, throw on some more lettuce or something.  Just cause I don't want the pineapple doesn't mean I'm not hungry."}
{"text":"Menu change again . No more crab cake sandwich. This place will give you a free appetizer if it's your first time there, but you have to tell them. They also have a birthday club where they send you a coupon for a free meal on your birthday. That's kinda nice for a night out for me and my wife."}
{"text":"I think the low marks for this place are unwarranted. Quality of food at this location is every bit as good as the other Atria's around town. Pot roast nachos are out of this world!"}
{"text":"I'm not a person who likes chains but Atria's is not your typical chain. Atria's is first class. Always clean and good food. Service can tend to be slow. Great bar with good bartenders. Think Cheers if it was set in Pittsburgh. Get the crab cakes and chopped salad!"}
{"text":"The food was not anything amazing--I had several types of pastas, which I only liked one in particular because of the spinach that came with the penne. They served some dessert that looked like it came from a supermarket party platter of marzipans and burnt hard chocolate chip cookies. I also asked for coffee and apparently it takes 40 minutes to make that. The waiter avoided eye contact after the I asked a second time and acted like I never asked for it."}
{"text":"Nothing special here. I went with a group. The beef was a little salty, and the breaded chicken parmesean was equally as unimpressive. The breading was soggy and lacked any crispiness. And the dessert was obviously catered from elsewhere, like a local supermarket dessert tray."}
{"text":"Friend and I started with red sangria.  It was pretty awesome.  Merlot + spiced rum and seasonal fruit.  I love a good sangria!

I had their Authentic Greek Salad + chicken.  The salad was good, even a hint of anchovy, though I could not find physical evidence.

Friend had a crab cake sandwich, which she proclaimed excellent - and I can tell you it was pretty excellent looking!

Service was attentive and happy.  Pricing was rather high...  high enough that if the service and sangria weren't so good, I'd skip the next visit without issue."}
{"text":"Atria's made our evening a great one last night. 
We had reservations for 15 for my Mother-In-Law's 60th Birthday dinner, at 6:30 on a Saturday night. We were seated immediately, which was impressive due to how busy the restaurant was. Everything that followed was equally as incredible.
We were permitted to bring our own cake (The Oakmonter from Oakmont Bakery - not much compares to that), and not only did our server present the cake with candles lit immediately following dinner, she took it back to the kitchen and promptly returned with plated slices for everyone in our group. 
Every single person in our party was elated with their meals, and we all left full and happy.
Also, no one made a fuss about our \"purposeful\" off key rendition of Happy Birthday (lol).
Atria's, your staff went above and beyond for us last night. We appreciated every detail, and will certainly return soon. Kudos to you all!"}
{"text":"One of our favorites. We've tried just about everything on the menu and haven't been disappointed. Portions are generous, but if you're not very hungry, you can do fine on just appetizers. Staff is usually great. An occasional stiff, but they're replaced quickly. There are a handful of Atria's in the area and I've tried a few. Quality is consistent across this small local chain. Go there. They have added brunch to their weekends. Special seasonal menus. Octoberfest. Mardi Gras. Seafood Étoufée. Beignets. They keep getting better."}
{"text":"Been coming to Atria's for 5+ years now and with the excellent service, nice peeps and great food selections... that's why I keep coming back! Taking my girl here for V'Day and she'll be impressed! Management goes out of their way to make sure your dining experience is the best."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of Atria's, but I like this one the best. It's still got that Cheers-y vibe to it with the all wooden bar and photos of the local sports team hung around the Tavern, but it's a bit more newly renovated than the others. 

They rolled out their Winter Warm Menu a few days ago and I was fortunately there to get pictures and got to try it all! The Pot Pie, Meatloaf, Stuffed Peppers, and Bone-In Filets are all beautiful dishes. But the twice baked potatoes and onion rings that come with the Meatloaf are TO DIE FOR. 

I also was privy to some bar action and got to try a cappuccino with baileys. I wish I knew more of what was in it because if the potatoes were to die for, this thing had me writing my will. Creamy and perfect."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a must in my book.
What a Delicious menu,  wonderful portion sizes,  very comfortable atmosphere.
Leaving you very satisfied!!!"}
{"text":"I would stay away from the Louisiana Lobster Pot.  First of all it's served in a bowl.  Description should read seafood pasta with chopped vegetables (didn't like red onions in my pasta). I've had bigger shrimp than the 1/2 lobster tail that is served on top. For the 26.99 they are asking, my opinion it's not worth the price.  Reading other reviews about Atrias, someone said their food is hit or miss.  I can't agree more.  This meal was a miss.  Server was polite but we had to ask for bread and grated cheese.  Who serves pasta without bread??  Zucchini appetizer was very good and desert was also good."}
{"text":"This place was pretty great. They have bottled root beer, a nice staff and as we had out company lunch here, they were very quick with being proactive to our needs. As if they were mind readers they were there refilling drinks before we could even ask. Their Quatro Dip is many layers of gooey goodness but their fried zucchini is the appetizer jackpot. I kept going back for more not caring that I could get full off of just that. For my entree I went with the jumbo sized crab cake touting itself as being oversized and it wasn't. I finished it in one sitting and I've seen crab cakes bigger at Mccormick. It was good though and had flavor. It wasn't anything to brag about. I enjoyed their hand-cut fries as I could easily tell they weren't frozen. I like this little place and when I'm on the North Shore I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"We came across Atria's looking for another restaurant but I was not disappointed! The Crab Bisque soup was creamy and delicious. I ordered chicken parmesan and it was fantastic as well. Ask for the cream vodka sauce! Portion was huge but it made a fine lunch the next day. Would definitely return to Atria's."}
{"text":"Atria's is currently running its Oktoberfest promotion, something I wasn't aware of considering this was my first trip to any of its franchises. How ironic is it that my first Atria's experience happened to be at THE first Atria's, the one founded 82 years ago? 

Kay and I have whizzed by what I'll refer to as Atria's Prime far too many times to be forgiven, especially considering that we've resided in its zip code for well over a year. Some weekend errands that took us up and down this South Hills corridor left us with excuses no more. We had to lunch here. 

A chipper lad acted as a valet, parking the Kaymobile safely. I doubt the other chain-ish Atria's offer this, but do not allow it to put you off if you're worried about dining casually at a casual price point. Our t-shirts and jeans were not frowned upon at the least, and my wallet wasn't left gasping when it came time to settle up. 

A hostess led us to an upstairs dining room that overlooked bustling Beverly Road. From the looks of Atria's Prime's exterior and interior, I felt as if I had been invited to a Thanksgiving dinner as the guest of a wealthy relative I didn't know. And in these Victorian-ish environs...I just felt like a burger. In spite of Oktoberfest, and the not entirely common dishes being offered for a limited time,  I required nothing more than a burger. 

Kay's enthusiasm over the special menu did little to dissuade me. Even tasting her splendid Sauerbraten entree, luscious braised beef, doughy, nutty spaetzle, tangy cabbage and all, failed to fill me with envy. 

I was too into that burger, man. 

Every Atria's has one burger on their bill of fare: The Award Winning Cheddar Burger. 

This bull of a burger carries with it no fancy or out-of-the-box accoutrements. Mayonnaise, mustard, coins of sour pickle, shredded lettuce, tomato, and onion are all that come with it, and they are placed neatly UNDERNEATH the cheddar-robed patty (not only does this prevent a mess, but it also keeps the bottom half of the burger bun cool), which in my case was ordered medium-rare, something their chef achieved with the steaming, gushing precision of a champion grillmaster. The bun glistens with butter. The most perfectly actualized housemade potato chips, sliced longways, THE ideal way, come with (or fries or cole slaw if you must...blah) this unassuming masterpiece (I asked for a ramekin of  their fresh buttermilk ranch dressing to dip the chips in and was a very thankful I did so). 

What? They're selling soft pretzel sticks and bratwurst this month and next you're telling me? 

Kay insisted on starting with the salted bread batons, and I thought I was at Olive Garden. Not that I hate the OG or their breadsticks, but they lacked sufficient chew factor to make them memorable. Docile is how I'd describe them. With spaghetti and a salad is the only way I'd have them again. 

The bratwurst was brought to our table on a complimentary basis to commemorate our first visit by the chef himself, his forehead happily beading water like a car's windshield in a rainstorm. That he ran upstairs to give us some of the German sausage in gravy for free and speak with us for a moment was heartwarming. Kay loved the bratwurst. I thought it to be a tad bland and rubbery, but I won't gripe about it much since I felt honored to have sampled it at no cost. 

Hungry minds can be kindred. Hence our simultaneous decision to have the Black Forest Cherry Cake for dessert. Each cornerstone of vicious,delicious, maliciously moist cake was filled with a tart, grisly cherry compote, and iced with a cadaver-white, cocoa shaving-laced buttercream frosting. Chocolate sauce outlined the body, a tuft of maraschino cherry-garnished whipped cream to held off some of the depravity, and a snowfall of powdered sugar to reminded us of dark days to come. A more fitting cake to celebrate the Season of the Witch there isn't. 

To paraphrase the Atria's motto, it ain't bad to eat here. 

P.S. Our good-humored waitress Kimberly provided nimble, top-notch service."}
{"text":"Yet another concert at Stage AE (Lamb of God with Testament, Killswitch Engage, and Huntress) provided Kay, myself, and our friend Cindi with an opportunity to try another Atria's. It is this location, one we'd tried in vain to get a table at months ago before another North Shore event, that I will grant my first full 5 star review rating to. Luckily, with nothing else but a thrash metal tour de force happening in the neighborhood on a weeknight, we were seated promptly without a wait. 

Befitting its nearness to the area's concert venues and stadiums, exposed brick and images of everyone from local athletes and rock stars populate the dimly lit scenery, making the diner wonder whether she or he accidentally wandered into a sports bar, hipster-shrimpster gastropub (GASP!), or a speakeasy for weary, weathered journalists. Having described the interiors, this is the most impressively decorated and laid-out Atria's I've dined in thus far. One can't feast on banisters and framed memorabilia, however, so onto the food...

The first pitch was a serving of BBQ Pork Quesadillas. Within tortilla triangles that were colored like a gila monster, the three of us noshed on a most succulent shredded pig that nibbled on our tongues playfully due to the embellishments of pico de gallo, cheddar jack, jalapeno, onions, and a pepper chutney. Sour cream tuned the spice volume a notch while adding a cool, creamy counterpunch to the Mexican pizza's rich, steamy, gooey insides. 

As I mentioned in a review of the Pleasant Hills Atria's, their signature, heavily-advertised (their TV adverts go 'all crab, no cake' or something like that) \"Best In The 'Burgh\" Crab Cakes had been an itch along my spine for several months. After almost ordering the less-costly meatloaf (I'll take care of it at the next Atria's I hit), I splurged and went in for the kill. 

Assisted by a bale of first-rate frites and a refreshingly creamless cole slaw, the crab cakes lived up to their much ballyhooed reputation. Filled with generous, dewy hunks of jumbo lump, each of the two clusters was an exercise in indulgence, particularly when I dredged every forkful of protein through the prime remoulade that was provided. 

Last course consisted of a dome of a confection that I believe was simply called a Chocolate Peanut Butter Mousse Cake. A fudge coating sheltered a heavy and heavily enjoyable candy-dotted mousse with a brownie acting as a basement, making for one scrumptious and imaginative structure that recalled an edible treat of a tribute to the demolished Civic (I won't call it Mellon) Arena. 

Lesseee....3  Atria's down, 5 more to go. Until then..hey, meatloaf, you're next. 

P.S. Michael, our waiter, provided service that was unflaggingly efficient and mindful.

P.P.S. In case yinz didn't know, legendary local doo-wop singer Johhny Angel supposedly co-owns the entire Atria's chain and performs at their various satellites from time to time with his backing band The Halos."}
{"text":"The drinks agree to die for and the pot roast nachos were amazing. The waiter Jonathan not only catered to us but actually drew is a map of places to see. Definitely a place to come back to."}
{"text":"Atria's is our go to restaurant.  The food is consistently good.  They make great martinis and the service is excellent.   Love the pot roast nachos!"}
{"text":"In a land where Burger King and Eat-n-Park (on the scale of Denny's) restaurants rule, Atria's is one in a hundred to this non-local foodie. My God, the atmosphere in Atria's is beautiful -- high ceilings, gold chandeliers, white tableclothes, and this is part of what dining out entails, right? A chance to be served in a place that does not resemble our homes. And, Atria's delivers. It offers fine dining in a lavish and warm setting for reasonable prices. It also has some fun seasonal activities; check the website, but at the Murrysville location, for example, they offer Oktoberfest and Murder Mystery dinners! The food is - as mentioned - delicious. We got the pumpkin ravioli, which was amazing -- except for the addition of pear tomatoes in this sweet dish. It was a bit weird. How about some real pears? 

If you like red meat, be sure to try the Bourbon-glazed pot roast; if you like seafood, the crab bisque is creamy and delicious. I do not recommend the new turkey burger, which was gamey, or the Chicken Marsala, which was tough and not tender or juicy.  

For lunch, I highly recommend the open-faced turkey sandwich, with homemade cranberry orange sauce, stuffing, and gravy: it was incredible! And, the caesar salad, which you can get with grilled chicken -- which is just wonderful! Really moist and tender. 

Atria's has a good selection of wine and specials on mixed drinks.  Atria's is a welcome and needed addition to Pittsburgh's cluster of bars, fried food and pizza shops, and fast food joints."}
{"text":"one of favorite palces in pittsburgh. food is fantastic and waitstaff is warm and friendly. never had a bad time. my favorite dish is the pork fillet gorgonzola . .delicious. lots of seasonal and weekly specials to keep it interesting. go. you wont regret it. they have  a bar area downstairs for more casual atmosphere and a more dining type atmosphere upstairs if you like a little less noise (although i wouldn'tcall it noisy at all). can't wait for summer to eat outside"}
{"text":"Held a company luncheon here. Linda was fantastic throughout the process. Linda, Anita and the rest of the staff were very helpful and accommodating the day of. The room was wonderful and the food was great. Would definitely recommend and look forward to returning for future events."}
{"text":"I was here for dinner with a couple of friends. It was our first time here. At our table we had ordered the salmon, and the tilapia and the crab cakes. My friend who had the crab cakes said there was very little filler in them and that they were very delicious, and she would definitely get them again. We had Sangria to drink. The bartender and our waitress was very nice and friendly. We split a carrot cake for dessert and it was awesome. The place had a nice atmosphere. We are definitely coming back."}
{"text":"We took my whole family here for Mother's Day brunch and it was actually awful. We had a party of 11 people. We made the reservations ahead of time and the day before they called to say there was a race in front of the restaurant and we couldn't park out front. My 80-year old grandma was coming with us and she has trouble walking. The restaurant apologized but had no options for handicapped parking with the race going on. My dad parked in town and wheeled her in a wheelchair across the bridge. This worked out fine, but when we arrived at the restaurant they had us at a table upstairs. We asked them to show us to the elevator. They didn't have one. So after all the discussion the day before about handicapped parking why on earth would they seat us upstairs? We had to wait for a table to be set up downstairs. Luckily they were not busy.  We were seated near an outside door and had space for the wheelchair but by the time we were ready to leave they added a table outside in front of the door so we had quite a bit of trouble maneuvering the wheelchair to get out! 

We also had trouble with the food. My mom and sister don't eat gluten so they ordered a meal that had potatoes listed as the side dish. It came out of the kitchen with noodles instead of the potatoes. They said they changed the menu. But that should be explained by the waitstaff when someone orders the meal! We also waited over 15 minutes before someone even took our order. 

I did enjoy my own meal but all of the other trouble was not worth it. We won't be back to this location and especially not on a holiday when we expected to go all out for our mothers and treat them to an expensive meal without any issues about seating and such!"}
{"text":"It is a tiny restaurant and parking lot but don't worry they do valet park all cars. Since we came during the holiday season, it was nicely decorated and felt very cozy inside.

I ordered the fish tacos, and my friend ordered the steak with gouda mac n' cheese. The fish tacos were very flavorful with a nice slaw and sauce on the fish. The fish did have that fishy aftertaste which I was not a fan of. The portion was good though for the price: three hearty tacos, rice, and beans. My friend said her steak and mac n' cheese were delicious and she was very satisfied. 

Overall, a decent restaurant for some classic dishes. Nothing though super memorable, so I don't know if I would come back."}
{"text":"ok, i don't want to judge all atria's by this one. in fact, i wouldn't even judge this atria's solely by this one experience. but let me tell you, i was highly disappointed.
i will point out the good parts of the night first. we arrived to see a band play. the entertainment was great, didn't cost extra (although there was a $20 minimum per person), and i liked the set up in the room where they played. also, the soup i got (crab bisque) was delicious!
ok, now, for the rest of the experience. first of all, our service was AWFUL. i don't know our server's name, and i know some of the wait wasn't his fault, as there was a large party upstairs. but it took at least ten minutes to even order our drinks, another 15 before we even got them. ten more minutes before we could order our food, and after the meal, we must have waited at least 15 if not 20 minutes for our check before one of the members in our party finally had to go up to our waiter and complain. i saw him checking on other tables, and it didn't seem like he had many tables to keep him so busy. as a server, myself, i always give my servers the benefit of the doubt, but it really got to be too much. the one thing i will say for him though, was that he was very nice. but for how much we waited, we should have had something comped or at least got some sort of apology BEFORE we had to complain.
the rest of the food and drinks were okay. good, but not enough to make up for the service. i had the berry mojito to drink and the greek salad to eat.
i'd try another atria's before i'd go back to this one. but now i'm weary of the restaurant all together."}
{"text":"The best part of the dinner was being able to sit outside. Our server was pleasant, but not very knowledgeable about the menu. She did not know what the catch of the day was nor if the ahi tuna salad was served on a bed of lettuce. (It does not come on a bed of lettuce...it is basically served with a side of cucumber.)  The tuna was requested rare and it was way overdone. The Reuben sandwich was the worst. The meat was super thick and bread was soggy. The meat should be thinly sliced and the bread should hold for the duration of the meal. The fries were decent. The blue cheese dressing was delicious. Also ordered the pot roast nachos...where was the pot roast? I felt like they barely put any meat on the nachos in order to save money or something. I've been to Atria's before and had much better experience, but this was pretty bad. Unsure if I would be willing to go back any time soon."}
{"text":"My husband and I had an excellent meal from their Octoberfest menu this week.  We started out with the cheese soup followed by the calimari, which was extremely tender. Our main courses were delicious and we had enough for lunch the next day.  My schnitzel was seasoned just right and the homemade spaetzel was yummy. My husband had the sausage meal and loved it.
We took desert home, the chocolate cherry cake, which was also delicious.
Dana, our server, was very attentive and personable.  She made our dining experience at Atria's even more enjoyable.
We will be back!"}
{"text":"This is a 3.5 star review.
I took my visiting friend here for Sunday brunch this past weekend and there were some ups and downs. Our server with an endearing KY accent was very warm and accommodating; even giving my friend a free cranberry juice. She always had a smile so that was really nice. However, there was only one other table and it did take a long time to get our food. 

This is a fancier place with some nice decor, so the prices definitely reflected this. The entire brunch menu had some nice choices but nothing under $14! Portions are medium sized for me, but my friend finished hers in all of 3 minutes... I was REALLY looking forward to those chocolate chip beignets but they were more like regular doughnuts; not puffy and light at all. Still great tasting but...not beignets. Also, Since all 3 of us ordered a brunch menu entree that includes beignets, I feel like we each should have gotten a small plate of 2 or something instead of 1 each. Our server did give us 4 in all (she mentioned it was an extra) so next time, I might not even go for these beignets. 
My fellow brunch mates thought everything tasted really good but I felt like my dish was a little blah. I ordered the chicken and waffles and the chicken was not seasoned at all! The batter was too light and wrong for this breakfast dish. I recommend against this dish here.

Anyways, it's a higher end restaurant in Murrysville and opens up a few more options for locals. I might check out the dinner options in the future."}
{"text":"Took the wife and kids for lunch as was very pleased with the experience.  The staff was friendly and the food was delicious.  We had the Baja Fish Tacos and Marsala Chicken Breast with fettuccine.  The kids had burgers and fries.  The prices were just what you would expect for the quality of food and service.  I will be going back again!"}
{"text":"We came here to take part in their Brunch with the Easter Bunny festivity.  The positive was that my meal was pretty good.  I had baja fish tacos which were pretty tasty.  My wife ordered off of the \"special Easter brunch\" menu.  Her enchiladas were good but were cold.  The service was slow and not efficient.  The bunny could have helped speed things up with some Easter magic."}
{"text":"I've been here a fee times and I'm not going to cover each meal individually..

The food is very good, and of the four or five different meals I've had I can't say anything bad about any.  My issue comes in with the expedience of the kitchen an poor service.  Every time I've been here I've waited at least and hour for my food, the last time about an hour and a half and two of the meals were salad, one meatloaf which you know is made ahead of time.  The manager did make this right and our would be $80 dollar bill was it in half.  The other problem are the servers, though friendly they are terribly slow, and aren't overly professional in that I've always had to ask for what the soups and specials are.  Not inly is good service slow, but I think we waited almost 20 minutes for two waters, a beer and a glass of wine last time we were in...  All other trips have been similar.

Solo food, nice joint, but painfully slow."}
{"text":"Well it has been a while since my last visit here so my girlfriend and I decided to have lunch there. Again we got the free valet parking. The staff was very friendly and asked where we wished to be seated. I let her choose since she had surgery recently so we ended up on the main floor.

The first thing we noticed was the place was very cold. We had wondered if they left the air conditioning on from the previous day. They were offering Italian specials so my friend opted for the eggplant Parmesan and salad. I decided to take the vegetable salad with chicken along with a cup of wedding soup. Although it took a long time to receive our food it was quite good.

I thought the presentation of the salad with the triangular shaped pita bread was marvelous. it wasn't overfilling.

Later on we both used the restroom only to find it was bone chilling cold and although clean in a deplorable state of disrepair. I really thought that a place like this that offers free valet parking would have nicer appearance. The first floor was fair in appearance and had a full bar. We sat at a booth.

However, the staff was attentive to our needs and will return as we see fit."}
{"text":"I love coming to PNC Park in the Summer. If i get here early enough i stop by atria's and have a scotch, Johnny Walker, rocks, no water, what did that scotch ever do to you? When i was eating meat I'd get the lobster bisque or a huge plate of pot roast nachos. The meat that covered those nachos were perfectly cooked with a nice char outside, moist and succulent inside. Lots of cheese and other nacho fixens. Good Stuff!

The burgers here are just as glorious, nice crisp outside, moist and tender inside, good bun, great bacon if i ordered it. Atria's is a great restaurant in PNC Park, but when i go to PNC Park, I want ballpark food. So I head to Atria's when the Bucs are out of town."}
{"text":"Drove up to free valet parking (remember cash for a tip, luckily I had some). The door was opened for my friend and I, we were promptly seared and warmly greeted by every employee we came into contact with. The dining room we were taken to was awkwardly small and w one larger table in there was as loud as the bar. And slightly less comfortable.
Our server was very attentive w many personal suggestions which were helpful. The food was quite good, was not a fan of the garlic vinaigrette, which the server has recommended. However my friend and I ate every course, and every bite! Lol. Idk what they put in the whipped butter they serve w the bread but it is amazing. I was pleasantly surprised with th quality and freshness of the Ahi, which I had for my main course. My friend said his burger reminded him of his grandmothers, exactly what he wanted. Prices are middle of the road, reasonable. We will be back and especially in the warm weather to enjoy the patio seating."}
{"text":"Our group of five visited Atria's for lunch a few days after Thanksgiving.  Our food spanned the gamut from OK to really off.  For example, the reuben sandwich was fine--a very normal, unexceptional reuben.  The crab bisque was extremely over salted (gross!), and the pumpkin bisque was tasted overly sweet, like there wasn't enough acid or saltiness to balance the dish.  In general, this is kinda what I would expect from a suburban restaurant attempting to be fine dining.  And perhaps these are kinks that will be worked out over time.

The service was not great.  As soon as we had finished eating our meal, the server never once came by to refill our water glasses (and we were thirsty after consuming the salt--er, i mean crab--bisque).  I could understand this behavior if the restaurant was busy and they needed to turn the table, but it was well after any meal time rush and the majority of the tables in the restaurant were unoccupied.  What gives?

So, while the experience wasn't horrible, it wasn't good enough to inspire me to return in the near future."}
{"text":"Dined here with the family tonight. But, they did messed up my mom's burger.... but me and my sisters dishes were great. I had something on the octoberfest menu. It was fantastic. They did mine correctly!!!! Service, was good. They, did give us a free dessert on the house. But still was kinda dissapointed about my mom's burger being cooked not right. But the second time was correct, it was just rest of us were done. I would still go back to atrias just not hamburger. But they have other great thing. Chicken parmesean was amazing. Chicken piccatta is pretty good. Overall, i will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Although Atria's has multiple locations, going to the Murrysville location is well worth it! I like to grab dinner there on Fridays at the Bar with the great bartenders, Peter and Ang, or sit in he dinning room. They have a great wine selection, even for their house wines. The appetizer selections include: Cheeseburger Sliders, Coconut Shrimp, Fried Zucchini, a Four Cheese Spinach Dip, and Pot Roast Nachos that could all be meals!! For my meal my go to is the New York Strip Steak!! It's delicious!! I suggest going Medium Rare, but medium works just as well. Friday's they also have Prime Rib that is on point! The Filet Mignon is another great option. Check out the menu for seasonal specials, and the website for special events. The bar fills up fast as does the dinning room. Reservations are not required, but I suggest them!!"}
{"text":"I love Atria's. I remember when the original location in Mt. Lebanon was an old man neighborhood bar where my friends and I would get beers from another friend's grandfather when he'd come home with a six pack. 
The food at this location as with all of the locations as always been spot on and I've never had an issue with quality, taste or service.
Of course my go-to fave would be the Pot Roast Nachos. 
Can't beat 'em!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to grab a drink and/or a snack before a ball game. Great staff and a large bar make this place perfect to meet friends. And the beer is way cheaper than beer in the park."}
{"text":"I have a dream. A dream that some day the North Shore will have a ton of amazing food options. I hope one day it will become a reality. For now, I think there's a smattering of okay-ish places and a lot of mediocrity. 

Maybe it's just the built in crowd. You come to a game, you gotta eat, right? And what are you going to eat? Either at a restaurant outside the stadium or inside. At this point I'd stick with inside for the novelty of it all. 

I stopped into Atria's on game day, but came in right as the first pitch was going out, so it wasn't packed in the least. Our server was obviously not into us, as well as serving that day, as she was pretty short with us the entire time. Sorry we bothered you...

The menu is incredibly limited with around 5 apps, 5 sandwiches and 5 main courses. I get that they're probably just limiting things for the crowded times, but I felt like nothing really called to me. I settled on going halfies and ordering an app and waiting until I was inside the stadium to get my \"main course.\" Crab fries, naturally. But that's beside the point.

The pieorgies we ordered were okay. They were doused in Parmesan cheese and a little overcooked, but it wasn't the worst thing I've ever had. Wasn't the best either. I think what really turned me off was the whole experience. Service, small selection and mediocre food. I should have just ordered two buckets of crab fries and called it a night!"}
{"text":"Ordered a burger medium, arrived well done and dry, bun was burnt and fries soggy.  Sent back and the next one was the same, although the bun was slightly less burnt this time.  My guess is they cooked it days ago and reheated.  Others we ate with had similar experiences with the exception of the salads.  Low quality food with poor preparation.  I can honestly say I have never had a good meal there."}
{"text":"This is a good local chain with about 7 locations.  I believe this is the first one and I used to stop here more often when I kept an office in the area.  I was there last week with some guys I used to work with and since we were getting the \"band back together\" we decided to hit up this South Hills institution because we were an institution of sorts years ago.  We got there at about 930 PM last Tuesday.  This is an immediate plus because many non major chain restaurants don't serve food past 9 or 10 PM during the weekdays in the burbs'.  The kitchen is open here until 11 PM.  The space itself is pretty cool.  It very much has a local watering hole feel to it.  They have valets that work during the dinner rush to park your car promptly with a smile.  In the Summer they have a patio area that is perfect for al fresco dining.  The interior itself is homely with dark wood, moderate lighting and the decorations on the walls are authentic and not the mass produced types at tj mcfunsters.  There is seating in both upstairs and downstairs and it is cozy while still providing privace from the table next to you.  On Tuesday we all sat at the bar and there was a pretty packed bar (surprising on a winter tuesday for most places, but I'd guess not this place), but all 5 of us were able to eventually get a seat.  The patrons were young and old, suits and jeans and for the most part friendly even though it was clear initially we weren't part of the usual clique'.  The food is nothing spectacular, but it is solid 3 star dining a step above olive garden and casual chain and not quite fine dining.   They had guiness on tap with always warms my heart.  The wine selection was decent and reasonably priced.  I was able to get a couple pours of a decent red malbec for under $10 per glass.  My buddies were able to find a few okay scotches to choose from and I think they had glenlivet and glenfiddich I think up to 24 yr. old.  The bartender, sarah I believe was very good, attentive and friendly.  This is the kind of bartender that makes it easy to grab a burger and a beer by yourself at a bar.  I started with a cup of the sherry crab bisque, which was a lot better than the last I had here.  It was thick and creamy without being too thick.  It also had noticeable chunks of crab.  I then had the chedder burger which was a big burger on a warm perfectly toasted bun oozing with cheese, however I wasn't asked how I would like it prepared so it was a little overcooked for my tastes.   I substituted asparagus for fries for $.50 more.  The asparagus were tiny and not that good, but I guess it's not the season.  Mike had the seared ahi tuna which was pretty good and better quality than I would have expected.  I think Trevor, Lloyd and Rob literally ordered everything on the appetizer menu.  I tried one of the caribbean shrimp which was a pretty good not overcooked large shrimp with tasty coconut breading.  They also had the mini burgers, pot roast nachos (pretty good I'd suggest trying), fromage dip (forgettable) and a few other things.  All in all a good neighborhood place that is a local franchise and worth your time if you are looking for an alternative to the mega chains."}
{"text":"Visited Atria's for October fest and was sadly disappointed.  We ordered the veal shank and sauerbraten, our favorites.  Both were tasty, but dry, almost as if they were left over from the night before.  Sides were very good, but really crushed since we normally have had great experiences at Atria's."}
{"text":"I was here on a business dinner and it firmly seated itself as the absolute WORST place I've ever eaten at. 
-hair in the food
-crab cakes were touted as amazing, in reality disgusting ice cream scoops of poor crab and mayonnaise 
-\"risotto\" uncooked and congealed to plate. 
-vegetables gummy and soaked in oil. Not properly prepped and served with woody stems. 

I was shocked this place turns a profit"}
{"text":"I eat at Atria's once a week. they have great food and drinks. in the fall I go there more often becauseof football."}
{"text":"We stopped at this place on our way from Pittsburg to Penn State college with family. Choosing it randomly we were very glad we did. Service is 5 stars and food is very delicious. Keep up with great work guys. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I have visited here a few times when in town, and have been delighted each time.

For starters, Crab Bisque. Just do it. Don't ask any questions, just do it.

From there, the seasonal menu really delights. I have yet to try anything I didn't enjoy. The valet might catch you off guard if you aren't prepared for it, but this place is a gem."}
{"text":"This place never fails to disappoint me.  Have been going to this restaurant ever since they first opened.  They once were a very good place. The last few years they have been going down hill.  The menu sucks. They only offer over priced food. The last time I was there the waitress brought our basket of bread and some butter, but no dishes to put the bread on. I was sitting near some corner shelves in the back room of the restaurant and had to get our own dishes off the shelf.  I ordered the sangria because it was advertised as one of the Friday night specials for $5.00 a glass, but was charged $9.00 on our bill.  $9.00 is a rather high price for any glass of sangria. The time before that we ordered take out and when my husband went to pick it up they had totally lost our order.  With all the new restaurants opening up in Murrysville, Atria's will be my last choice to go to for a meal."}
{"text":"I went to atrias a little bit back for their sunday brunch. I was really excited to hear that they had smoked salmon. We got there two hours before the brunch was supposed to stop, a reasonable arrival time I thought (although technically any time during that window should be fine). However, when we got there the buffet was well picked over. I thought perhaps they were going to bring out more food. I was mostly wrong. The pancakes were dry hockey pucks that tasted frozen. The smoked salmon I was so greatly looking forward to was gone and when I asked if they were going to bring out more I was VERY rudely answered \"no it's done\". It is hard to convey how rude this cook behind the buffet was but I was greatly offended (and I was very nice about it)! The food was not great and not worth the price at all. Go somewhere else for brunch."}
