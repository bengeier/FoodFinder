{"text":"Food was good but way too overpriced for the portion you get never again,me and my girlfriend felt like we were absolutely ripped off."}
{"text":"I use to visit this restaurant years ago and had not had the opportunity to revisit for quite some time because I was out of state, and I thought that it had closed for awhile. I was really glad that I returned to it and that the menu still had some of my old favorites that are not always easy to find. It has a nice diverse menu with some foods that you just can't always get, or at least not that taste like homemade; for example chicken paprikash with real dumplings. The paprikash does taste like maybe they add tomato to it, which I don't do at home, but it was good. The prices are not bad at all. I believe our bill came to under $45 for three adults and a toddler. I liked the 50's diner decor that it use to have better than the new look, but it is more open and roomier now. One item that we had a problem with was the spinach pie. The flavor was good, but there was not much of it. The waitress explained that they are homemade by a supplier, and that for whatever reason this batch had very little filling in it, but they took it off the menu with no problem and did not make excuses. I really appreciated the honesty and customer care. I will definitely be going back. The humus is also very good!  Visited October 2015"}
{"text":"I miss eating here.  It's a great place for families to go and has some great items like the white bean chili.  Our family still talk about how we wish we could go."}
{"text":"Best restaurant for comfort food in Amherst. From the Pierogi dinners, to the fresh lake perch, to the pizza that is Danny's signature dish, you will not be disappointed. I eat here at least weekly because the food is delicious and reasonably priced.  By the way did I mention the ice cream and home made HoHo cake!  The waitresses and the the cooks are top notch."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time tonight.  The service was generally ok, but i think the waitress must have been new, she wasn't as knowledgeable of the menu as she should have been.  The food was good, but the piece of chicken I got with my meal was tiny.  Otherwise not too bad of an experience and I would recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Burgers are good. It is worth the drive from Cleveland. The services is fair.   The \"Bet you can't\" Burger is not worth the effort. It would be easy to eat if it actually tasted good. FYI the bun is awful!!"}
{"text":"We are coming back! Often! The service, the fun atmosphere, and the FOOD! So delicious! I had the chicken gyro with their home made tzaziki sauce, my daughter was in heaven with their lemon pepper chicken, broccoli, and Syrian rice (pilaf with chicken broth), and my husband had the envy of them all, a taco fold over! Delicious!"}
{"text":"I made a trip down to Ohio so my man could look at a car. The whole experience lasted longer than expected so we stopped to get something at Sal & Al's after reading good reviews on Yelp.  We got a very young waitress (maybe 12). She was amazing. She seated us and brought us our water, even asked if we wanted lemon in the water. Throughout the meal other waitresses also helped us who were equally as personable.   There was a wide variety of food on the menu but, not so much that it was overwhelming. Both me and my date ended up getting Syrian specials. They did not disappoint. I would recommend this place anyone interested in good food and service."}
{"text":"I just happened to be passing by and noticed their nicely lit sign. I love little diners, so I decided to check it out. What a nice surprise! Very clean from what I saw and cleverly decorated. Two of my favorite comfort foods are on the menu...chicken paprikash and pierogi yum  I wasn't hungry enough for a full meal, so I ordered the pierogi sampler and a cup of the paprikash soup. Both homemade and soooooo good!!! And very filling! My server was Haley and she was great! Very welcoming and attentive, really nice young lady! The one thing that was a bit out of place was the salad bar or lack thereof. Not an appealing presentation, better off just making the salads behind the scene. Not opened for breakfast, but I'll bet they'd do a nice job if they were. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I dig it. Pretty cool car themed interior. Fair prices. Good service. Great menu and good quality food.  Awesome pizza. Quality perch. BBQ bacon cheeseburger with an onion ring was fan-freakin-tastic !  Do it - Do it."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our recent dinners here. We split chicken paprikas and a pepperoni pizza, along with some pretzels stick as an appetizer. The menu has many different options. Our boys really liked their chicken strips and fries- crunchy and delicious. At the end of our meal, desserts and ice cream were on hand. We will definitely try Sal and Al's again!"}
{"text":"love love sal & al's pizza!!!! it's the best ! You can tell the owner Danny was the creator of all his families fabulous restaurants ... !!"}
{"text":"Best fried perch, great onion rings, always friendly plus they have a ice cream shop in house. I come up once a month from Cincinnati and this is a go to spot. Chicken papriska and pier goods also. Excellent"}
{"text":"I love their Syrian salad, Syrian bread and hummus. Spinach pie was a bit sparse and dry. Definitely gonna stick with Salad next time. I had the Mediterranean platter."}
{"text":"Good food and good service. Several Syrian dishes that were very tasty. I had the meat loaf and bowl of the white chile. Very enjoyable to say the least. Several other items on the menu are worth a visit next week to try."}
{"text":"Great place good service, and quality food. Went with my wife and ordered corn beef sandwiches, it's not Joes or Slymens size but still a quality sandwich. Was surprised to find a good deli in Amherst, oh."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, a great stop for us and our two small kids.  Pizza crust is light and airy with a bit of garlicky goodness, causing us to eat more than we probably should have.  The meatloaf has sausage in it, making one of the best meatloaf sandwiches that I've ever had.   The only negative part of the meal was how incredibly slow the service was- and they weren't even crowded.  This was mostly irritating because it meant that we didn't have time to try a likely delicious dessert!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten here twice now and both times we have had the friendliest servers! The food is awesome and they even have a Syrian section on the menu. This place is very kid friendly. It is never really busy, which is a shame"}
{"text":"Best chicken paprika sh around.  Just like grammas...  this is an awesome diner. A true amherst local shop. If you are traveling through stop.  Great food and great people!!!"}
{"text":"Sal & Al's restaurant is very quaint and comfortable. The ambiance is quiet & relaxing. Food is well worth the trip, nothing fancy, just good comfort food! Shout out to Cindi, she was very welcoming & friendly... as we all know, hospitality is half of the pleasure of dining out! Look forward to stopping in again.... menu is full of scrumptious, fun food!  #SatsfiedCustomer"}
{"text":"Good food and a nice atmosphere. I stopped in for lunch with my parents and we all had a good time. No complaints and I will return in the future when the opportunity comes up."}
{"text":"What a great place, just went here as I read really good Yelp reviews and was just driving through the area.  The Diner has a great atmosphere, top notch wait staff (we had a young girl who was very friendly and was assisting the other staff and kept coming by to check on us -- superb waitress in training, we were both impressed).  The food was delicious, with a fine Syrian selection and various other diner type offerings.  We tried the Syrian selection and were quite pleased.  If you are in the area, go here, if you are just driving through, get hungry and stop by!"}
{"text":"If you didn't know this place was here you would drive right by.   The decor is very interesting with a music, car theme.  They have nice big booths, so parties of 6 or maybe even 8 could easily fit.      My husband started with the tomato basil soup which was extremely hot.   It was good, but a little too sweet.  He had a patty melt which was very good.  He didn't even eat the whole thing it was so big.   I had a fried buffalo chicken sandwich.  At first I was disappointed that it was two chicken tenders with sauce poured over them, but once I tasted it, I was no longer disappointed.   The bun was super fresh and the chicken was tender and the sauce had just the right zing.    Both meals were served with fair fries, at a more than ample portion.   Our iced tea tastes more like water which was our really only negative.  Service was very good and when I had first ordered a turkey Reuben but had asked if it was deli turkey or fresh roast turkey, she thought it was fresh roast.  Kudos to her for asking the cook and learned that it was deli turkey and told me so that I could change my order  Update:  Stopped in again on August 26 and everything was equally as good as last time.   This time I had the Philly Cheesesteak Wrap, made with chicken and it was served piping hot and had lots of flavor.   My husband had the same patty melt as last time and enjoyed it again.   He did try the chicken paprikash and although it was decent he said he has had much better."}
{"text":"Locally Family owned & operated, wonderful homemade food. Catering also available"}
{"text":"Came here with the family --  ordered ribs, wings, and the lake perch dinner.  All were excellent and were huge portions.  Service was prompt and attentive."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch 8*5*17 with the #NoInviteCrew for our first food review on local family owned businesses, the decor was nice, our server was awesome very attentive, very personable, even have us a in depth history of the ownership of the restaurant which I've found out we've been to other establishments that are/were owned by Danny & his family.       First came out the breadsticks, it was described as light & airy & I tell you I haven't had anything taste as delicious as them before, light & airy doesn't describe them, they melt in your mouth as soon as you bit into them, the marinara to a surprise was served warm never had it served like that before, I mentioned if the pizza dough is anything like the breadsticks this place is going to have one off the best pizzas in Ohio.       We had 2 family style pizzas 1 sausage, 1 pepperoni both had extra cheese, as soon as I bit into it you can tell the cheese was freshly grated, could tell the provolone/mozzarella blend, right amount of sauce some places either have to much or little to nothing sauce which was flavorful, the dough/crust was delicious.       My brothers had beers they complemented on how cold they were which they were given chilled glasses for them to drink out of.       Over all the experience was wonderful wool definitely go back again we highly recommend it, if we can give it more stars we would, keep up the great job we wish you much success..."}
{"text":"Great diner food    The White Chili is super and reflects the owners Middle East origin.with great seasoning but not spicy hot.  You would think you were in a Hungarian restaurant the Chicken Paprikash is that good.  And any of Rosie's Syrian dishes are good"}
{"text":"I love small, informal, comfort food type restaurants that are locally owned! Admittedly they can be a hit or miss proposition. However, when they are a hit it is a nice experience.  In all aspects, this was a hit! Located next to a polish bakery, the restaurant has a 60s diner feel to it. There are not a lot of tables. Service was prompt and attentive. The menu is varied.  I enjoyed my tomato bisque soup as a starter. My wife ordered a fried buffalo chicken sandwich and I had a patty melt. Both were very good. The patty melt was huge!  Prices are reasonable. We will certainly return."}
{"text":"Great place!!! Our service was a little slow, and the waitress apologized up and down. Our food came out hot and fresh and we got free dessert because of the wait. I didn't think it took that long, but apparently 25 mins for a main course was UN heard of! We got chicken papricash and burgers. Food was great! I will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and diner atmosphere.   Had the Syrian sold with chicken and my wife had the chicken sandwich.   Will definatley come back here."}
{"text":"I love eating here.  Their wings are great.  Their white chicken chili is great.  The owner really cares about his restaurant.  They strive to make the customer happy.  Mel who works there is the best server."}
{"text":"I give this place 5 stars just because the waitress (shit I forgot her name!! starts with a B?) was sooo awesome :). I ordered a Syrian salad with cajun fries and the salad was pretty good, pretty standard, but the FRIES! The fries are amazing!! Make sure to get them!! Everyone else I was with ordered all sorts of different things, and all the food was in the range of average to great. So if you're in this area, I suggest you try it out, even if just for the fries or for the amazing service! :} The atmosphere is reallyy cute, too; there are a lot of cute music decorations around the store, and it definitely has an old diner-feel."}
{"text":"Mediocre hash house fare at very best. The dining room is filthy and the whole \"greek\" theme is over the top. The owner should make his cooks clean instead  of taking so many cigarette breaks. oh yeah, change your oil in your friers. The stench is revolting!"}
{"text":"Went here a few months ago with my daughter. The food was very bland, not good at all.  Needless to say we won't be returning."}
{"text":"The food was okay. It wasn't something to write home about. Customer service wasn't the best either. The owner just sat there with wife or girlfriend and ordering people around. Instead of him getting up and checking on things his self."}
