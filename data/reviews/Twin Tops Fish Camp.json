{"text":"Very good fish camp with more than enough fish. We had the platter and brought home over half of it. It had oysters, crab, shrimp, perch, catfish and flounder. More than enough! Was excellent tasting. Will eat there again."}
{"text":"Family get together for dinner Saturday August 27th 6:30 p.m. after 30 minute wait for a table for a party of 7. The waitress brought out hush puppies to the table they were cooked in old grease and also our fried food. We have always enjoyed twin tops in the past and understand it's got new kitchen management. It was nasty food cooked in old grease We will never go back. I guess all things change."}
{"text":"Nice servers with little knowledge.  Food is passable but I wouldn't say good.  Atmosphere is redneck but if the food was good that would add to the rating.  It is the experience one is looking for when deciding to eat at such an establishment.  I enjoyed those I dined with, my brother and father.  The dirt track race after diner was a blast and still allowed coolers to be lugged in."}
{"text":"Fried seafood anyone? There seem to be quite a few fried seafood restaurants within close proximity of each other, but this one seemed highly recommended. It was hard to bring myself to eat any more as this was the 6th stop on a food tour. We ordered the green shrimp (fried) Senior platter to split 3 ways. Tender, small nuggets are lightly battered and fried to a light transparent golden color,  but they were only slightly crispy.  Hush puppies were not bad. I could not eat the baked potato served alongside the shrimp,  but I did find myself enviously eyeing the black pepper crusted fish several of my bus mates ordered."}
{"text":"The portions of seafood were small and the tarter & cocktail sauces were many times more than you need. I had rather have a little more seafood. Pricing is too high for the quality. Disappointed and won't be back."}
{"text":"I don't know how they stay in business here.

You go in, and are greeted by the most incredibly kind servers in the world.  The ambience is straight down-home; if you got this kind of sweet and genuinely Southern service in a major city, you'd think they were screwing around with you.  Everyone is \"sweetie\" or \"darlin'.\"   You get a ton of delicious and fresh hush puppies, and the fried pickle chips are to die for.  

Your order will consist of an obscene mound of whatever you order  I'm six foot two and two hundred pounds and I couldn't hope to choke down everything they put in front of me.  Unreal.   It's all pretty good deep-fried deliciousness in the old school style.

A warning: They don't take credit cards, and in lieu of a debit card reader, they actually have an ATM behind the register.  It's kind of a royal hassle, and the main reason this isn't a five-star joint. 

Summary: The sweet potatoes are to die for, the hush puppies are fabulous, the servers are a panoply of insanely sweet and amazingly Southern gals, and the fish itself is pretty danged good.  It's just a royal PITA to pay for your meal."}
{"text":"Great place for fish or shrimp, just make sure that you are ready to wait on a Friday or Saturday at 6pm. I normally try to get there before 6 or shortly after and it is still about a 10 minute wait but way worth it. 
Donna and Tasha are the best servers there plus they always take good care of me, while I am in so it helps quite a bit.

if you have rated this place less than 4 stars, you are un-American

{"text":"My Father and boyfriend are absolute addicts of this place. As a matter of fact, they drag me here pretty much every time I come into town. I'm not the biggest fried food fan, but this place does it right. The calabash fried shrimp, fried green shrimp, and salt and pepper fried flounder are great. And the crab legs are seriously the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"The all you can eat platter was more than I could finish! Service was great and very friendly wait staff! This is very family oriented and a great value for the price! Wish they served beer! Definitely plan on returning for another great meal!"}
{"text":"Donna was our waitress and she was awesome, very friendly and accommodating. 

THEY HAVE REAL BACON FOR THE SALAD BAR!!!!!

They have a great breading for the fried food, real ranch dressing, mountain dew on tap, oh and the squash was fresh squash with the homemade breading, so bonus there.  (Probably bc it was is in season)

There is a full fledge candy corner as tall as the ceiling and everybit of 20 ft long.  

So if your looking to get your calabash on, fish camp style,  I do recommend this place.   

I will be back here for sure."}
{"text":"We recently relocated to this area and I honestly had never heard of \"fish camps\" before. My son absolutely LOVES this place. He gets the calabash and I usually get catfish or shrimp. It has been consistently good. 

The salad bar has a lot of toppings to choose from including REAL bacon, boiled eggs, homemade ranch, and homemade 1000 island, etc. 

And (to top it off) the sweet tea is super sweet (if you're into that-which I am!)"}
{"text":"I have never been to a fish camp before. I'm brand new to Belmont. This place look rather deserted during midday during the week but this place explodes on the weekends!
I had attempted to eat light.
I told Lindsay my waitress I was a rookie. She sat down and explained everything, the differences between the Green Shrimp and the Calabash and whether to choose the whole fish r the filets. I opted for Fried Salt and Pepper Catfish filets and Regular Flounder filets. She even asked if I wanted more filets to take home. I barely made a dent with what I had on my plate! Holy cow! My \"Doggie Bag\" is overflowing! French fries, salad bar, coleslaw,hush puppies, and fish fish fish....."}
{"text":"I was not her for the decor as it is a fish camp. Looks like a 50'S interior. Fried seafood and lots of it. They have whiting all you can eat every night which includes a salad bar trip and one side for $7.75 I believe. They load up the first plate with so much fish I could not order more. Prices a very reasonable. They do have broiled on request on some items. I am a fried food fan so I go here once a month"}
{"text":"I ordered the #1 Special, which is: ALL YOU CAN EAT UNLIMITED flounder fillets, popcorn shrimp, and deviled crab. I had my choice of baked potato or fries, and I went with fries. Hush puppies and white slaw were provided with the meal. Sweet tea w/lemon. 

The special also included a trip to the salad bar, but I was there to chow down on seafood, so no rabbit food for me. 

* FRIED FLOUNDER? Not greasy, but not much flavor. No crispy crust. Average. 3/5.
* CALABASH SHRIMP? Generous serving. Not crunchy. Forgettable. 2.5/5.
* DEVILED CRABS? I've baked grocery store deviled crabs that were better. 2/5.
* FRENCH FRIES? Not very good, because they weren't crisp or hot. If I dined here again, I would go with a baked potato. 2/5.
* WHITE COLESLAW? Super finely chopped, creamy, pretty good actually. 3.5/5.
* HUSH PUPPIES? Barely warm, tasteless, and not worth wasting valuable tummy space. They provided a generous serving. 2/5.
* SWEET TEA w/LEMON. A-MA-ZINGLY GOOD. I lost count after five glasses. 5/5.
* TARTAR SAUCE and COCKTAIL SAUCE were very good. 4/5.

* SERVICE? My waitress had to have been close to eighty years old, but she did not stop moving for one second. She could walk and work me into the ground any day of the week! Plus, she knew every diner in the building. The servers were friendly and sweet. 4/5.

* CLEANLINESS? The restaurant appeared to be very clean; however, the plastic menu that I had was very dirty with either dried ketchup or cocktail sauce residue. YUCK! This was very unappetizing. I didn't see a sano rating posted anywhere. 3/5.

- Value? This restaurant definitely favors quantity over quality. Servings are very generous, and with the all you can eat option, the sky (or your pant's waistband) is the limit. My cost for basically two seafood platters was a tad over $17, plus tip. 
 
- There appear to be MANY regulars, many of which are long past retirement age. 

Locally, Jones Fish Camp in Denver and Long Creek Fish Camp in Dallas have better quality fried seafood for only a couple more dollars."}
{"text":"Im not a huge fish fan but took the family out on a friday night to check it out. The place was packed . First off its a legit old school southern fish camp. Its no frills but the servings are huge. Im a big fat guy and couldnt come close to finishing my plate. Quality wasnt really that great. But about the same as any fish joint at the beach.  Servers were super nice and there was a good vibe. We took enough home with us for a complete 2nd meal. For 2 pre teens and 2 adults the whole bill was $70 not awful for the amount of food. We will probably be checking it out again"}
{"text":"If you're looking to eat a ton of fried seafood, then this is your place.

Fried shrimp is my dad's favorite food. Growing up a couple of miles from the Gulf of Mexico, there was never a shortage of fresh seafood to fry up. As a matter of fact, where I come from, a fish fry is more common than a BBQ. So, being serves mounds of fried fish, shrimp and hush puppies takes me back to summer afternoons in the backyard with family and friends. 

I'm told they have excellent sweet tea, which I will have to try upon my next visit...which I expect won't be too long from now."}
{"text":"Everything was good except don't order all you can eat anything on a Friday or Saturday night. They will not bring it out fast enough. I waited 20 minutes for my first reorder just sitting there. If they can't do it on a weekend they shouldn't offer it on the weekend. Anywho, the other food was ok. The catfish with black pepper was  above average. If I try again it will be at 3 pm on a weekday."}
{"text":"After moving away 22 years ago, my wife and I returned to Twin Tops and memories of old. They say you can never return and find things the same or better. Not true in the case of Twin Tops - the sea food is as good and plentiful as we remember! The only difference is that we are now ordering from the senior menu. It is supposedly less food but it was plenty. The meals all came with a trip to the salad bar (which we should be eating). The sea scallops were large, sweet and lightly breaded. My wife got butterflied shrimp which she enjoyed and I got the green shrimp,  a friend got the fried oysters. All were good. Each dish came with coleslaw and choice of potato. If there was anything disappointing, it was the French Fries; they were not crisp but I had so much to eat, I didn't try them until after everything else was devoured. Twin Tops is back on our list of favorite places."}
{"text":"On one of our many trips to Charlotte we stopped for dinner at Twin Tops Fish Camp in Belmont. In addition to very tasty seafood - the fish and fried oysters were my favorite, this place also has a neat candy shop that will make you nostalgic for your favorite treats. I got a Charleston Chew.

Included with all meals is a generous portion of hush puppies and a salad bar. I was impressed that they even had gourmet toppings like Craisins (which, as an aside, are apparently extremely difficult to find in countries like Chile, where my cousin is currently studying; we got her a bag at Costco when she came to be in the wedding!) for the salad bar. The food is plentiful - next time we decided we only needed one plate! Fish camps are abundant in some parts of the NC Piedmont. There are several on the way to this place from the highway. I'm really glad this authentic kind of local food still exists."}
{"text":"Great family atmosphere. At first glance, I wasn't impressed. However, our server set down this delectable basket of fired goodness called...wait for it...\"hushpuppies\". I must say that im not a HP connoisseur yet these lil nuggets came with the most amazing dip/ sauce. The sauces always get me. Any who, girls grub time usually means we jet to something fancy but today we were feeling like a little seafood would do the body good. Boy, there is nothing little about these portions. I stuck to my purpose: JUMBO SHRIMP. I was in heaven. I got the half order which was a heafty 10-12 pieces. My friend got the plater which had a whopping 4 pieces of fish and green shrimp. It was soooo good I had to take my shrimp home. I didnt make it past the salad bar and potato. Lets just say that the food was good and prices were great for the portion size."}
{"text":"I grew up coming here every week with my family for our fish camp get together and yes, it is a huge thing in this area. Every family has their go-to fish camp and ours was always Twin Tops and for good reason too, they had the best seafood in town! 

I'm honestly not sure what I'm trying to say in this review. As described, I have this fond childhood memory of this place (we even had the same waitress every week for 15 years). But my most recent experience was less than stellar, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. The food is usually on point, but it seems like they changed the batter for the seafood? The oysters were small (seasonal I know), the scallops (I don't think they were anything other than skate?), the fish was overcooked and under seasoned, and the slaw was off. 

They have put in a salad bar I guess to be healthier? The irony is watching the locals get iceberg salads and loading it up with bacon and ranch then stuffing their faces with deliciously fried seafood. Honestly just kind of a confusing addition. 

I will be back because I love this place even if I'm in love with a memory. Hopefully the next time they will be on their A-game. 

ALWAYS FRIENDLY STAFF- which is a plus!"}
