{"text":"We recently moved into the area, and when looking to order Chinese food our friend recommended this place. Let me tell you we Love it!! Food is delicious, we've ordered from them twice already and will continue to. The best part is they deliver to your home which is perfect when you don't want to drive in this AZ heat. lol"}
{"text":"I don't understand why Mr. Cooks has only 3 stars. We've ordered for delivery three times in two months. Husband loves the beef with green peppers and onion and the Lo Mien noodles were fantastic. Chicken with fresh mushrooms and snow peas included more, water chestnuts, bamboo shoots and was delicious. I swooned over the egg rolls, one time my dinner was just them!  Husband of 35 years was stationed in the Philippines in the late 70's and has refused to eat Chinese food unless he makes it himself, memories of mystery meat.  I love Chinese and coaxed him into trying Mr. Cooks and we are both hooked. Food arrived hot with plenty of sauces"}
{"text":"Just went to Mr Cook's. Horrible service. Gal too busy on her cell phone. Stood there and ignored me for a couple minutes. When my food was ready she just plopped it on the counter and didn't say a word. I had to figure it out for myself. Now that I am eating the food at work it is substandard. The price they quote on line is not what I paid. I paid quite a lot more. The egg roll was extremely small and greasy, no flavor. The chicken lo mein is just ok. And hardly any chicken. I paid quite alot for just a bunch of noodles."}
{"text":"I've ordered delivery from here twice was a little nervous because of the ratings but have been happy both times . Really enjoy the kunj pow chicken ! Guys on the phone our always friendly :) delivery always under 25 min"}
{"text":"I ordered from here for the first time a few weeks ago based on the great reviews on here. It was not like any typical Chinese food I have ever eaten. You order your dish, but it comes with all vegetables, not traditional like in the food, they were on the side. I wouldn't normally mind but they were really soggy. Most Chinese places tell you which vegetables are in their food. The flavor of what I ordered wasn't even that good. I didn't end up eating it."}
{"text":"this restaurant had one of the filthiest restrooms that we have seen in a long time..the restrooms were located outside in the back of the building...they barely locked.there was no soap or a dispenser...the other restroom next to it,had rolls of toilet paper in the sink and it didn't lock properly either. As for the food..it was hard to tell,because when the bathrooms are that bad and there is no soap ..you wonder if they are washing their hands too. I am sorry for this review,because we were looking forward to having a new Chinese place to eat at in the neighborhood...and we like to support local business's,but we just couldn't get passed the uncleanliness ..."}
{"text":"I've never had Chinese food that tasted like absolutely nothing. Until today. The food was so bland that I am still trying to figure out how they took the naturally occurring flavors OUT of the food. We ordered egg drop soup, beef and broccoli, fried rice and sweet and sour chicken....except the sweet and sour chicken came WITH NO SWEET AND SOUR SAUCE....not on it, not on the side..none. Pretty disappointed since I very rarely order takeout."}
{"text":"I checked this place out for their take-out lunch special and I ordered the shrimp chow mein with fried rice. It was pretty tasty but I did notice the portion size seemed small. I guess that's what a lunch special means. Also the shrimp themselves were tiny. Good flavor seasoned the noodles and also the fried rice. My friend ordered general Tso's chicken and he can be picky about chinese food so I was surprised when he said he liked it enough to go back in the future. The staff seemed friendly enough when we showed up to grab the food but the atmosphere did seem like this is more of a carry-out type location. I will definitely looking forward to trying other things on the menu in hopes they have a dish that will really blow me away."}
{"text":"This Chinese is by far the best Chinese I've ever ate compared to the other Chinese food places in Phoenix. They are super fast with delivery and the food was nice and hot still when it arrived. I got the Mongolian chicken it was super tasty and the chicken was cooked super good."}
{"text":"Ordered from mr. Cook's Chinese based on other reviewers. This was the worst Chinese food I think I've ever had. After a few bites we ended up just throwing it away."}
{"text":"Every time I have ordered from them ether from grub hub or from my pay pal account my order has been screwed up because the don't have there stuff set up right if u speak to them on the phone the talk to you like you are stupid when u can barely speak English you should not talk to me like I'm stupid I call before and made a complaint about my order being wrong and the order being cooked like crap and manager the manager at giving me a credit when I called to get a credit Phil for the wrong food and it being curly the manager wasn't there and the person on the phone and told me well they didn't know how to find it so they couldn't help me and then when I finally got them to give me the credit they tried to charge me an extra they try to tell me I needed to order another $15 worth of food to get the delivery"}
{"text":"We order food here a lot its really good! Best part is they deliver it to you haha. Big portions as well it always hot. Friendly deliver driver :)"}
{"text":"Good chinese delivered in 30 min, very well and appropriately packaged  (sweet and sour sauce packaged separate from the pork/chicken/whatever so the breading stays crisp)."}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is always fantastic & delivery is usually quick. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and we orded the $5.95 lunch.  The food was cooked to order, hot and fresh.  The owners little daughter was helping bring the food out, she was really fun.  We had the pork chop suey, cashew chicken(delicious white meat) and broccoli beef.  The veggies on the chop suey were fresh, nicely cut and tasty.  I'll be back for sure, as we dig these little mom and pop joints.  Love supporting the local economy.  I thanked the cooks/owners and they really seemed to appreciated it."}
{"text":"I ordered through GrubHub; food came in the amount of time projected and the order was accurate.  However, the quality of the food was just ho-hum.  Too much grease.  Won't bother again as there are better places to order Chinese delivery."}
{"text":"Good food cooked to order.  However I am grossed out by the American kid working the counter because he has tobacco in his mouth and is spitting it in a cup in front of customers"}
{"text":"Mr Cooks has 2 guys that go door to door putting up flyers. They stole my last cigarette off the front porch and I called in and Mr Cook to tell him and he acted like he didn't speak English. Such BS."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery last night (saturday night). They do not de-vein the shrimp, the orange chicken tastes a lot like ketchup and they forgot part of the order (forgot the dumplings). I won't order from there again. there are a lot of options to not settle."}
{"text":"Always hot and fast.  Best chinese food in the north valley.  I'm not sure if its all bought in or house made but its tasty either way.  It always needs just a dash of salt but I'm ok with that.. you can always add some, you can't  take it away.  I have been searching for a place that has legit fried wontons.  Dragon palace has a spec of meat, if any (no exaggeration) and is pretty much fried dough. This place has a good teaspoon size portion wrapped in each one.   I also recommend sweet and sour pork! It's great! Delivery driver is super fast too.  Ordered delivery, live 10 minutes away. They were here in 20 and the food was too hot to eat.  When does that happen??"}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is fast, hot, delicious. The people are courteous and I just like the atmosphere. Mr. Cooks isn't a fancy dining place. Everything is served on paper plates and plastic utensils and for 6$ a meal... It's perfect in my opinion. Try it!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal take out! By far this is one of my favorite to go Chinese places. The staff is always super kind and helpful. Some of my favorite dishes include: the egg roles, chicken lo mien, sweet and sour chicken, and the jade vegetable(I think that's what it is called, though I may be mixing it up with something else). It does not take this place too long to make your food. I can call it in and start driving there and by the time I get there it is ready. The portion sizes tend to be a bit large, so be prepared for leftovers (which is a huge added plus). Overall I love going to this place!"}
{"text":"It's alright but the chicken is super dry and has too much in the middle so you end up eating and tasting dry unflavored chicken at the end of every bite. They also charge you for drinks on top of their combo prices so that's sorta whack."}
{"text":"do not order from this place! i got horrible food poisoning from the broccoli chicken on monday 1/2/17. i've ordered from this place twice before and did not get sick but i ordered the garlic chicken both times. i was throwing up for 12 hours a few hours after i had the broccoli chicken. i was so dehydrated from throwing up and could not keep water down for almost 24 hours."}
{"text":"always hot, flavorful and delicious! the only chinese place I order to go from in phoenix. I have tried so many places and been disappointed but Mr cooks has yet to leave us unsatisfied. the staff is friendly and the food comes fast. I haven't eaten inside but it did look dated. now I always get it to go. yummy!"}
{"text":"This is easily the nastiest Chinese food I've ever had. Will never eat from there again"}
{"text":"I ordered from here for the first time tonight. The people are nice and service fast, but the Dragon Phoenix was so bland I hardly ate it. Also, I got some Egg Drop soup and it was not hot - 106 degrees. Threw that away! You never know long it was sitting. What a waste of $15."}
{"text":"Not bad for 2 dinners and an appitizer for under 30 bucks.. including delivery. I ordered the sweet and sour chicken and it was good.. I was a little disappointed in the seseme chicken.. there was no seeds just some red sauce all over it, but again for the price including delivery I would order again if i didnt feel like cooking. The cheese wang tons were again just okay  Update! They now add sesame seeds! And my husband and I find ourselves ordering once a week here it's amazing!$"}
{"text":"Great food and fast delivery!  I am so glad that they now offer home delivery and accept credit cards.  Will definitely order again!"}
{"text":"This is the BEST Chinese food! Great selections for vegetarians. The food is fantastic, it's not greasy, nice size portions. I love it."}
{"text":"RUDE AS FUCK CUSTOMER SERVICE. I called for delivery and the guy might as well have slapped my face through the phone. He was being extremely fucking rude. I used to order here all the time but I'm done with this place."}
{"text":"Okay, I know when to give up.  I've now gotten food from Mr. Cooks three times and I've had a problem three times.  Twice my delivery order was missing something.  Yesterday I got a takeout order.  When I got home the soup (large) had leaked over everything.  There was only about 1/4 of the soup left.  The soup had nearly \"melted\" the carton of white rice.  What a mess!  Now, the food is not bad, but I just don't want to trust them to do the right thing."}
{"text":"First time ordering from here using the flyer they left on my door. It took an hour which I didn't mind. But when the food got here, there was no plastic ware, one order was wrong, and they didn't bring my drink. I don't think I will be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"This free-standing former Taco Bell in a strip mall located on the southeast corner of 32nd St. and E. Cactus Rd, had been Golden Bowl Chinese Food for decades. I was a regular customer of Golden Bowl as they had decent food at a very good price.  When Golden Bowl suddenly became Mr. Cook's, I was not happy. I assumed that the food would be the same, but with a higher price to pay for their purchase of the restaurant. I planned to eventually check them out, but failed to do so until last night.  A few days ago, I came home to find a Mr. Cook's menu taped to my front door. Perusing the menu, I noticed that the menu had changed from that of Golden Bowl.  Yes, the prices were a little higher than Golden Bowl....but then I noticed the \"Dinner Special\" menu at $7.45 per person that was actually LESS than what Golden Bowl's dinner menu had been.  So, my son and I ordered takeout of our standby fare that we use to initially compare Chinese restaurants.  Mine is Mongolian Beef and my son's is General Tso's Chicken.  I was very pleasantly surprised! The Mongolian Beef was some of best I've had anywhere. The strips of beef, the vegetables, and the sauce were all excellent.  The rice was perfectly cooked and not like a lump of mashed potatoes. In fact, the rice was the best I've EVER had. My Mongolian Beef was at least as good as that from another nearby restaurant that charges $10.45 for theirs.  My son also very much liked his General Tso's Chicken.  My portion was large enough that I had to finish it the next day,  As much as I liked Golden Bowl and its Chinese owners, with whom I spent much time just discussing current issues, I have to admit that Mr. Cook's food is much better.  We will now be frequent customers of Mr. Cooks.  The only suggestion I have is for the name. \"Mr. Cook's\" does not invoke images of good Chinese food in the minds of most who see it.  It sounds more like a grill of some sort.  In fact, the name was one of the things that initially put me off checking them out."}
{"text":"will not order again,I ordered 2 things and there was sand in the overcooked shrimp & the food was bland .I'm just very disappointed especially with the fact that the driver literally asked for gratuity even though it is included in the delivery fee when ordering,he didn't even bring the food to me.he calls me from the parking lot to get my food from him.well anyway I asked if he had change of a 5 dollar bill ,he responds with he has only fives and tens so basically he's expecting me to give him the five,so I do but that behavior and the not so stellar food is the reason I will not be back."}
{"text":"This is one of my go to Chinese spots in the area. Always quick and the food is really good! Cashew chicken, Mongolian beef, hot n sour soup, all good! The owners don't really speak English, but they are really nice. It's the kids who work the phone and register that are complete idiots."}
{"text":"Pan fried noodles, for 11.95, was nothing more than crunchy chow mien noodles (from a box) with meat and sauce. This place is an embarrassment for American Chinese. Coming from a city that has a Chinatown larger can one block, I have come to accept that good Chinese is limited in Phoenix but this is just wrong. I was going lazy and got delivery instead of driving to Nee House... NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"So I just ordered kung pao beef n pan fried noodles the flavor was good but the Kung Pao had 6 peanuts in it? And the Pan Fried noodles were like a dry ramen pack I buy at the store did you miss the pan fried part they were hard as a brick very hard to eat anyhow they are expensive too which I dont mind paying for if the food is done correctly not happy with this order!"}
{"text":"Tried this place a few times now and we have only experienced incredibly fast delivery service. Could be because we live right around the corner, but still. That gets a star. Every meal comes jam packed with loads of vegetables...another star, although sometimes the ratio of veggies to meat is too high. I do still want SOME meat in my dish. Unfortunately that is where the 'good' ends.  1. Icky meat. Have tried two different beef dishes and three different chickens and each of them had poor quality meat. The beef is so chewy that it takes two minutes to get through one piece, not good. And the chicken is just funky, like a springy sponge. 2. No flavor. After trying several different dishes, they all kind of taste the same, like the same sauce is used for everything. The sesame chicken at least tasted like sesame but was pretty dang dry. 3. Too much sauce. The underwhelming basic sauce that seems to be on everything, smothers what it is on. Except for that sesame chicken, dry as heck.  So two out of five...I will probably just look for another Chinese place."}
{"text":"In the world of fast food Chinese there is a bit to be desired out there but this place is above average. The portions are large, the prices are definitely fair And the service is fast. My two complaints are 1) I think they have consistency issues for example sometimes they will give you an egg roll with lunch sometimes they won't. Sometimes their soups are hot and sometimes they are just warm. 2) The female owner. If you work nearby and eat inside this woman is always and I mean ALwAYS on the phone the entire time with the loudest voice ever! It's almost as if she is arguing with someone every time I eat there. It's definitely not a relaxing mental break from work eating inside.  The potstickers are excellent. Veggies are always crisp and fresh."}
{"text":"Horrible food and service!!! Stay away from this place, the food is all previously frozen and tasteless!!  Not even worth the price or time, the service lacks in so many levels!! When I called in my order the man over the phone seemed annoyed that I called, I put that aside and still ordered as I was craving Chinese, and it wasn't even worth it. Trust me, stay away and go with your next best option!! Uhhhh, it was nasty!"}
{"text":"The ingredients were fresh and the taste was just right, without too much soy or sugar...  Mongolian Beef and Chicken with mushroom & snowpeas were delicious.  Me Cook's exceeded my expectations."}
{"text":"Your \"Happy Family\" meal was very very small. I've ordered from others near you and have gotten 3 times the portion size for the same money. To me, that's not nice. I will not order from you again because your food is certainly not the reason for the higher price. You are taking advantage of trusting people and soon the word will get out regarding your business. As you know, nothing sells better than word of mouth!"}
{"text":"I went today for lunch and here was the issues:  1) hot and sour soup was BLAND. Literally tasted like chicken broth. No flavor at all.  2) I ordered a lunch special which comes with an egg roll. Did not receive the egg roll.  3) asked if there was sweet and sour sauce in my bag (for the egg roll that didn't exist) and was told it would be $.50 extra! Really? $.50 for something every restaurant serves with their egg rolls? Umm no.  4) ordered the Mongolian beef extra spicy, it was milder than I'd ever had it there before when I ordered it regular.  5) Mongolian beef was 75% onion, 5% mushroom, 20% beef. I ordered Mongolian BEEF, not Mongolian onion.  6) as I was getting my bag from the counter I noticed a large bucket (like the orange home depot ones) sitting on the floor with a large wooden spoon in it, no lid, and full of red sauce (I'm assuming it was sweet and sour). Not a clean way to keep food. So turns out it was good I didn't get the sweet and sour sauce after all.  I will NOT be coming back. Ever."}
{"text":"I call the deliver  last night,food is good ,organ chicken so good,deliver is fast,l like it!"}
{"text":"Our new favorite Chinese restaurant! A gentleman left a menu on our door the other day and I spent the day staring it and planning dinner. We ordered take out tonight and it did not disappoint! We ordered two dinner specials--broccoli beef and cashew chickens. Both excellent. Meals also come with an egg roll. The food was amazing and we have leftovers! Our new \"go to\" restaurant for Chinese food."}
{"text":"Just ordered dinner from Mr. Cooks. Food arrived within 20 mins. The delivery man was very nice and the food was piping hot! Lemon chicken, sweet-and-sour pork and egg rolls were good! We would order again!"}
{"text":"Don't do it!! Horrible. They never showed up. We called 20 min. AFTER they were supposed to be there. They told us it was on its way. 15 min later we called again and they didn't answer. We called several times, they never picked up the phone and NEVSR showed up and as of now, still charged our card. Going to the better business bureau. This was not just bad business it's illegal. They took our money, lied, never showed up."}
{"text":"Fastest Chinese place I've ever been to! Our food was out in less than 10mins which none of the other places have ever been to were that fast. Super impressive but also kinda worries me. Like, why is it ready so fast lol...hmmm. Oh well. The food was tasty and served really hot! Only complaint and reason for my 4 out of 5 star is the grease. Now I know Chinese spots are known for their super greasy food but this place was on grease steroids. The amount of grease on my beef broccoli was extreme. Wasn't really fond of that."}
{"text":"My girlfriend is from Oroville and there's a restaurant called Tong Fong Low (aka Charlie's) out there. Upon moving here we looked for a Chinese place that was as great as Charlie's and it took us about a year. One day we got a little menu at our door and we decided to order from here. We were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food. Everything tasted amazing and we finally found our resident take out place! Deliverers are always friendly, timely, and had everything we ordered. Definitely glad we found this place!!"}
{"text":"Mr. Cooks has cleaned up the place, made it more customer friendly and appealing. Food is good, the servings are good. The downfall of this restaurant is the lady who is suppose to take your order. She is ALWAYS on the phone and I don't mean for business purposes but to talk to friends. She does not care about the business just who she is talking to. Sadly this will be the cause of this restaurant to close. She could be nice and helpful to customers but feels she is more important than any customer coming into their place. So sad as Mr. Cook has tried to make it a better place."}
{"text":"Not a fan. Delivery was super fast but the food was very bland. The fried rice had no flavor, my shrimp was really undercooked, and the egg drop soup needs salt. Most likely won't order from them again."}
{"text":"Our favorite is the orange chicken and the sweet and sour chicken."}
{"text":"From the beginning, they could not understand our phone number, address (we live on a street right next to cactus!) and our full order. After waiting over an hour and fifteen minutes, we finally receive our order, cold and incorrect.  I recommend not ordering from this restaurant if you want quality service!"}
{"text":"We get takeout from here all the time as it is one of the only places around that delivers. Food highlights: soups, dumplings, boneless spare ribs, General Tsos and Singapore noodles - all fantastic. Missing star: they don't handle well any large orders for pickup over the phone, where the pickup is multiple people paying (combo cash and cards). This really only matters for those who do group lunch ordering."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible horrible. We ordered take out for the first time. We tried to figure out what goes with what, the menu above the counter was confusing. No one knew any answers, they kept having to go to 1 lady to ask. Anyways we took our order home and it was literally inedible. My son and grandson ordered the orange chicken. We've never seen greasier food. The fried rice was so bland and tasteless. I ordered the hot and sour soup and it did not have a pinch of spice not even salt. It was water and starch with some tufo and other stuff. I also ordered the shrimp with lobster sauce and it was disgusting. The egg white was saw and the starch was uncooked. I ate the eggroll and spiced up the soup but I wish I didn't. Oh my stomach didn't like it at all. We all had bad stomachs all night. NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"Tried Mr. Cooks for the first time a couple of days ago.  Their customer service and delivery service was fantastic. The food was delicious.  We ordered the shrimp lo mein , sweet and sour chicken as well as their orange chicken and egg rolls, all of which were delicious. This is my new place for Chinese food delivery. Also found their prices and portion sizes to be just right."}
{"text":"We went at 3:27 pm so we got the lunch prices.  I ordered Szechwan chicken-hot and my husband got the General Tao's chicken -hot.  We did not eat there.  We are not restaurant snobs and were  hoping for a good local place.  But it was very hot in the small place.  We had a short drive home so food should still have been hot and crisp.   The general Tao's was very mushy!   Mine was salty and neither were hot and spicy.  The fried rice had very little flavor.  It didn't seem fresh.  Perhaps this was an off day but we won't go back because there are many other places to try"}
{"text":"Went here with my boys for dinner. I've been here in the past and was pretty good. I ordered chicken and broccoli and beef and broccoli. The chicken and broccoli was all broccoli, no meat. I took it back and told them. Then they bring us another order and it's alI vegetable oil. I went to show them and they acted like that was normal. I never  had Chinese food drenched in vegetable oil. It had to be a good 1/4 cup of vegetable oil in our food. No apologies or offer to remake the order.Now my stomach hurts. Worst Chinese food ever."}
{"text":"If only they didn't serve the food on plastic plate, plastic spoon & fork, styrofoam bowl, I would give this place 5 stars.   The food: AMAZING I came here for lunch (they have Lunch Special hours), I ordered sweet&sour chicken, the chicken was fresh! So delicious! They served the sauce separately.  But like I mentioned above, with the plastic spoon & fork, I couldn't cut the chicken and the spoon is small, it was kinda annoying specially when you're really hungry. I don't really care about the rice, to me the rice was fine.  Oh and also, you need to buy the drink from their fridge. I asked for water and I needed to buy the mineral water in bottle. I think they need to do something with the drinks because it's $1 for a small can of soda.  But overall, the food is delicious! I'll come back to try their other menu next time :)"}
{"text":"Their vegetable soup is delicious and I love their Lo Mein! There is not much to the soup, just a ton of veggies in a chicken or veggie broth. But if you're sick, which I was, it's perfect! The Lo Mein has TONS of delicious flavor! Much more than any other Lo Mein I've tried. Their fried rice is fair at best. I love that they deliver."}
{"text":"Sadly, we live in north Phoenix, and my wife loves Chinese food. We've ordered from Mr. Cooks several times, and always with fingers crossed. Mr. Cooks, we have to break up. Your Orange Chicken and General Tso's chicken are identical, so it's no wonder my wife is constantly confused with what she ordered last time. As well, the broccoli is ALWAYS overcooked, and beg and plead as I might for them to hold the peanuts in the underwhelming Kung Pao chicken, the never do. As sad as we will be to lose the best delivery driver in north Phoenix, we must move on, and tell our local friends to do so as well."}
{"text":"I pondered ordering from here for over a year because they put a flyer on my door. The pictures look good reviews seemed ok also but when I got my food it was not good. Looking at it looked ok but when I tasted it the chow mein left a weird film in my mouth and the vegetables fried rice had a odd taste to it that Made me feel like the pan it was cooked in had burnt residue in it or something. I tried to eat it because I was hungry but the lie caught up to me and I threw it all away. I wouldn't waste my money again eating here. I wanted it to be good but it wasn't.  Im sick of people throwing slop together with sweet and sour sauce here in the valley and calling it Chinese food!! Why cant we get good Chinese food here in phoenix."}
{"text":"This is the restaurant with least effort to make a customer feel welcome I've ever experienced. Besides using the dining area as storage for boxes of supplies,the lady at the counter acted as though we were intruding on her personal phone conversation,barley taking the time to answer any questions we had. We ordered the lunch specials, got a small foam cup of water with a wanton in it ,the waiter pointed to where we get the spoons. The Kung Pao Shrimp was fishy smelling,served with dried out fried rice, with some sort of coating over the stinky shrimp, two young men came in as we were leaving and were warned, thanked us and went somewhere else. I didn't ask for a refund, because I couldn't wait for the argument, why don't these Chinese people take this seriously, like some of the others in town,and this was their Grand Opening ! I wish that Yelp had a lower rating than one star just for people and places like this! We left full plates and went ti Iron Chef on Tatum, Chinese owned and operated,fantastic food,Great sushi and very friendly."}
{"text":"This is typical stodge drenched in red dye sauce. The dumplings were good and plentiful but the chicken chop suey tasted like it was cooked in hot salsa mixed with Ragu. The veggies had no snap and the place was generally run down and unclean. There is no bathroom on premises. Better value almost anywhere."}
{"text":"Fast delivery and delicious food. The food was hot and freshly made. By far the best Chinese food I've had in the area!"}
{"text":"The food is probably the worst I have ever had. The service is no where near the corner of happy and polite. Although I took into consideration it was the end of the day and its location. Two bites in and I couldn't even finish the peppered steak that had the soft texture of rubbery tofu or the gizzard textured orange chicken or odd tasting fried rice."}
{"text":"The man that took my order was knowledgeable of ingredients and patient while I asked about numerous dishes.  Delivery was quick and the girl was very pleasant.   So the crispy wonton noodles to go with the hot and sour soup were missing.   No fuss or muss I called the restaurant to complain but the lady was very nice and sent them right out.   The small Shrimp Lo mein was delicious  and perfect size for one serving."}
{"text":"Repeatedly knocked on my door to leave unwanted brochures in an apartment complex with explicit no soliciting signs."}
{"text":"Mr Cooks is not the most sophisticated or tastiest Chinese food in the valley, however, it is pretty good for delivery. The food is always hot, fresh, and they deliver VERY quickly. I ordered 2 dishes at 11:30 and it was at my door in 20 minutes. They're about 10 miles from me as well. I have ordered the fried rice (average, kid of greasy), the Singapore rice noodles (my favorite dish) and the vegetable main fun. The soup is unusually pretty bland and the egg foo young was the same. Find your favorite dishes that they do well, and you're solid."}
{"text":"DO NOT TRUST THIS BUSINESS WITH YOUR MONEY. I placed an order with Mr. Cooks Chinese Cuisine over 90 minutes ago and it still has not been delivered. I called and the first time I was told it was out for delivery. I waited 15 more minutes and I called again two more times. At this point the restaurant is closed and no one answered my second or third call. I am extremely upset and very hungry."}
{"text":"Seedy, but I thought I'd give them a chance. I stood at the counter for a couple of minutes with NO acknowledgement. I  walked out."}
{"text":"Really good food and customer service! would recomend this place again there chicken isn't soggy or overcooked like most places."}
{"text":"I love Mr.cooks its the best Chinese place around reasonable price and portions great flavor and delivery is quick and on time, and as a side note Its a hell of an improvement from the golden bowl that's for damn sure!"}
{"text":"Complained to the manager about their paper garbage taped to our garage, stuck in our door, and thrown in our yard. He rudely told me it's not his problem, that I'm inconveniencing him, and hung up on me. Will never go here even if they had the last glass of water in the desert."}
{"text":"Extremely fast delivery, great portions. On the downside, the hot and sour soup was average,  and the szechuan chicken was decent, but hardly going to blow you away."}
{"text":"Really decent  take out  Chinese  food.  Prices  are about  the. Same or less than others.  Take advantage  of their  lunch  specials!  Dumplings  are  good  and the  curry chicken is really good.  Large portions so usually leftovers  are the next  day 's lunch."}
{"text":"Amazing !! YOU HAVE TO TRY IT! Fresh, large portions, good selection. When you order out they are pretty quick. It's fun to watch them prepare the food too. My sister and brother in law love this place too. They are starting to be regulars...lol...."}
{"text":"We order from here once a week it's become our Sunday tradition. We always ask for delivery they are speedy and the quality of food is amazing! Love Mr. Cooks!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Arizona it's the only thing that taste like Midwest food the beef and broccoli is the best on the menu the beef is cooked  just right and is a great quality  so don't let the outside fool you stop in and try you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"We have ordered from this place four time. Two of the four times, they have delivered the wrong order. The Chinese is good. But good luck getting what you paid for. They won't even attempt to do anything to make up for it. I'm not sure if I will go back."}
{"text":"Mr. Cooks is a fairly good Chinese restaurant in the north highway 51 area. The food is consistently good, but the way they present their food is inconsistent. Sometimes the sweet and sour chicken is covered in sauce when you order it, sometimes the sauce is on the side, which is just strange to me. Also, the workers sometime ignore order requests. For instance, I have ordered no onions in the fried rice multiple times, was told it would be done, but onions still in the rice.... ok? However, they are super fast with pick up orders. Ready to be picked up within 15 min every time."}
{"text":"Good food.  Reasonable price.  Super-fast delivery."}
{"text":"Poor customer service and horrible delivery wait times.  The \"owner\" of this establishment was so incredibly rude to me when I called to complain about how long my delivery order was taking. The \"owner\" spoke to me like a defensive, immature teenage boy! I couldn't even believe he was the owner (still can't to this day). There is NO Chinese order that should take over 1 1/2 hours to deliver on a weeknight!! The owner proceeded to tell me that his driver was in an accident an \"almost died\" and somehow all I cared about is my food. I don't buy his BS excuse for his poor delivery service one bit. He sounded like a complete liar.  BOTTOM LINE: Horrible customer service, I will never  return or recommend."}
{"text":"I'll never try this place since they cannot read English. I have a sign on my front door at eye level which says no soliciting. Their marketing person always leaves a menu taped to the sign that says no soliciting. I called the manager and told him. The response was to take down my address so he can tell the salesperson to stay away from my house. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"It's always delivered so hot that we can hardly handle it. I don't know how it arrives so hot, but my husband and I are impressed. Delicious and easy for dinner."}
{"text":"Our Local Chinese Take-Out Go-To  This is the place where we always get our to-go Chinese food. I couldn't tell you how many times we've ordered from here. Having tried most of the other Chinese restaurants in the neighborhood, this is hands-down our favorite. We've yet to have something we didn't like and our order has been correct EVERY single time. Living 10 minutes away, we always pick up because the delivery wait is just too long. Pick-up is usually ready in 10-15 minutes, even though it is always crazy-busy every time we go.  Last night we ordered cheese wontons, fried dumplings, two egg rolls, and a small chicken with mushrooms and snow peas, which we split between two people and ran $22. Some of our other favorites include chicken with broccoli, general tso's chicken, the lo mein, the mein fun,and the subgum pan fried noodles. The only downside is that almost all of the sauces are a brown sauce with no entrees here that I've seen with a lighter sauce like you'd see in a lot of East Coast Chinese.  I wouldn't recommend eating in here - only take-out. Mr. Cooks is in an old Taco Bell and the seating is limited. The owner is surly and I don't think I've ever seen her smile. There is a new employee working every time we go in, but the food is spot on every time."}
{"text":"Definitely never going there again. The dish I ordered is all small noodles. I called to complain but they only made excuses. Not worth 10 for small noodles that I buy at the store for 2. I counted 2 strings of carrots, 2 onions, 1 green onion plus those really small shrimps that you can get at Frys for 5 a bag"}
{"text":"Ok, so this isn't fine dining. But as far as Chinese carryout goes, I thought it was great. Very clean inside. Food was piping hot. Enough food on the lunch special for my husband and I to share, so we ate lunch for 6 bucks. Can't beat that. Way better than panda express. We will be back."}
{"text":"My favorite is the beef snow peas, chicken curry, and the fried rice is amazing. I have not had anything from this place that is bad."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying that I hate Yelpers who write a review without trying the product or service. But for this review, I'm going to be \"that guy\" because I feel it's necessary and deserved.   The bottom line is that I will never patronize this establishment. I've had a no soliciting sign at my front door for years. Everyone respects it. Other restaurants, landscapers, religious folks, etc. Not Mr. Cook's. It's literally the only flyer I ever get, and it's continual.  They choose to disrespect my property, they don't deserve my business.  Edit 4/24/18: the door menu hanging continues. Just got another one last week."}
{"text":"We ordered 3 dinner specials; the Orange Chicken, Sesame Chicken and General Tso's Chicken. 2 with fried rice, one with brown rice. They got our orders right, but once we got home with them we couldn't tell them apart other than the fact that the Sesame Chicken had sesame seeds. The other two were completely indistinguishable and they basically all tasted the same, give or take some spice. All of the food was unremarkable. It wasn't that it was bad, it was just so \"meh.\"  I asked for extra vegetables in mine and they put one tiny broccoli crown.  My boyfriend thought the chicken may have once been frozen and de-thawed.  The egg rolls that came with the food were not that great."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place! We order at least once a week and try something different each time. I highly recommend their  Main Fun plate and my husband gets the sweet and sour pork. Delish!!"}
{"text":"Awful 1st experience with this establishment. Ordered through Eat24 and waited 2 hours for a delivery for an order that was wrong anyway. Didn't bother calling to correct the mistake because the food was not very good either. This will be a \"One & Done\" for us."}
{"text":"Nasty. Enormous chunks of underdone veggies in the vegetable fried rice, including celery, which should never be included in any kind of fried rice. The sauce in the beef and broccoli was tasteless, watery, and yet oily at the same time."}
{"text":"Mr. Cooks Chinese Cuisine has really good food. It is always cooked to order and they are usually always busy in the kitchen. The location is in an old Taco Bell from years past. I call it in or sometimes or I order at the counter and then sit and wait for it to be cooked. I can see everything that is going on in the kitchen. The employees are friendly and helpful. I know whenever I order any of their dishes: Mongolian beef, Shrimp in Lobster Sauce, Broccoli and Beef, Orange Chicken, etc., it will be prepared with the freshest ingredients and it will be hot. I highly recommend this restaurant, as we have tried a few since moving to the valley in 2004. You can't go wrong ordering from them when the craving sets in :)"}
{"text":"Where do I begin. Fist of all they charged me twice and secondly two of the tree things I ordered were wrong. I ordered a sesame chicken with brown rice and egg drop soup.  What I got was sesame chicken with WHITE RICE and NO egg drop soup. What I ate was meh. Nothing to special."}
{"text":"My last several experiences with Chinese delivery have been underwhelming at best and horrible in many cases. I got the menu on my door today and decided to give it a shot. Maybe it was my low expectations talking but I am impressed!  Food arrived as other reviewers promised - fast and piping hot.  I got the pork mein fun and sesame chicken. The meat in both dishes was tender and moist.  Combined together it made for a very tasty meal. I will be ordering again.  Next time will be the true test - Mongolian Beef and Potstickers- my favorite Chinese American staples. Stay tuned......"}
{"text":"Negative Four Stars-Four !  To call this ptomaine parlor a Chinese Restaurant is a hate crime.  The last time I had Chinese this bad was in Omaha, Nebraska.  Barely prepared Sweet and Sour Chicken, no vegetables, no onion, no pineapple, just lugs of deep fried McNuggets and red dipping sauce.  Salt and Pepper Shrimp, meh.  Old potstickers.  The White Rice was the only thing worth eating.  Phoenix, you really need a Good Chinese restaurant, because I've been to three so far and they were all LOUSY."}
{"text":"This is quite possibly the worst Chinese food I have ever ate.  The vegetable taste old. The soup tastes old.   Short changed at register.  I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"We came home to a menu taped to my front door. Too tired and late to cook and we did not want to eat out, so the two options were take out or delivery.  We decided to give Mr. Cooks a shot. Because they are so new I knew that they would have a few great Yelp reviews from either friends or family. Then I noticed one very bad review.  But what the heck, lets give it a try.  I called the number and to my surprise it was answered by an anglo sounding gentleman, he was very polite and took our order promptly.  I had the choice to pay with either cash or charge. With hesitation I gave him my credit card number. I wish delivery places either allowed us to order online securely or gave their drivers a square for the smart phone so I could pay securely. If you are the owner and you are reading your reviews: good for you, way to stay connected to your customers and get Square or use apple pay, something other than handing over the information on the phone.  We ordered three dishes: the General Tso chicken, teriyaki chicken and chicken fried rice for the kids.  We were told they would be here in :35 minutes. I started my stopwatch.  They delivered, food was here in :24 minutes. Courteous delivery guy, not afraid of dog.  It passed the test, the egg rolls were good, the General Tso chicken met all expectations and chicken fried rice was gobbled up by the kids. My wife did not particularly like the teriyaki chicken, but then again it was dark meat and not white meat, next time we will try to order with the white meat."}
{"text":"I wanted to love Mr Cooks but I just can't. The food being bland and the bathroom lacked both soap (not even a dispenser) and paper towels.  If I had not already ordered and paid I would have left. The food arrived on paper plates and the temperature of the food was inconsistent like it had been microwaved."}
{"text":"After leaving a menu on my door I decided to give Mr. Cooks a try with a delivery order. They got my order right and delivered in the time they told me they would be here. Since I was being on the bad side I ordered all my favorites of egg rolls, shrimp and lobster sauce and fried rice. Paid $1.00 extra for the fried rice. All of which was very good and no complaints. Even the leftovers two days later were still good and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I got home early and found a flyer for this place on my door. I figured me and my fiance never ordered carryout before and we both love Chinese so why not give it a shot.. it was absolutely horrible.. The guys who delivered it firstly criticized and made rude comments about my Halloween decorations then come to find that the food was cold and not very well cooed.  The won tons were mushy and my fiance's lemon chicken was very bland. The orange chicken tasted okay other then it was cold!. Now I know why we never dared to do carryout before, because of places like this. I Will Never Order From This Place Or Recommend It To anyone."}
{"text":"I am very very new to this state and area. I have ate at a couple of Chinese restaurants and find this place a good place to eat. I did not eat inside, but I did call for delivery. I was told the waiting time would be 45 mins. Our food was hot and delivered within 30 mins of my order placed. I ordered sesame chicken and Mei Fun noodles. Both were very good and made fresh. The kids loved it!"}
{"text":"Yuck! The worst Chinese food I've ever had. I could only take a few bites of it then I ended up throwing the rest of it out. The shrimp were like the ones you get out of the can. The hot and sour soup was thin and tasteless. I question if there was one fresh ingredients in the whole order. I understand that this is a popular place with law-enforcement. They deserve better!"}
{"text":"Great food!. Had cashew chicken, chicken fried rice, and an egg roll!. Good portion sizes.  Ordered delivery.  Told me it would be 45 minutes, and they were right on.  Food was hot and my order was correct."}
{"text":"Ordered food twice here its really good! I mean its no pf changs but seriously good! Best part is they deliver it to you haha. Big portions aswell.  Try the chicken and broccoli with garlic sauce, its really good probably my favorite. The chicken lo mein is really good  I honestly just mixed the two together and omg so bomb haha. I will be 400 lbs soon :). But anyway yeah I recommend either of those dishes, my girlfriend got the orange chicken and said it was \"alright.\"  I ate her left overs the next day.... was pretty good in my opinion.  So if your sitting there reading these reviews and thinking \"can they be trusted?\" The answer yes!"}
{"text":"Called for a delivery the girl on the phone was super nice. Delivery came quick and the driver was friendly, food was hot and delicious! Will definitely be ordering again! Thanks guys!! Happy to find a neighborhood place!"}
{"text":"The food is great! Probably the best Chinese I've ever had delivered. I've ordered 4 times in the last couple months and they've never let me down."}
{"text":"Egg rolls were kinda good so were the wontons. But the house fried rice was so bland! I couldn't even eat it! Kind of a waste of money at that's point. I wouldn't recommend the house fried rice to anyone."}
{"text":"So close to my house,  had to give it a try.  Just got hit and sour soup and crab rangoons. Delicious! I only went once when it was Golden Bowl and don't like the soup so I never went back.  Will have to try more based on this!"}
{"text":"horrible food.  tacky, dirty atmosphere.  honestly i'll never go back, the food quality is incredibly subpar."}
{"text":"Ah, Mr. Cooks... your food is delicious, Your menu is a tasty item menagerie. Your dining area cleanliness is suspicious, Always opt for pick-up or delivery.  I have never been disappointed with my meal, Egg rolls, sweet and sour pork all tasty. But the people on the phones, what's the deal? At least the food is always done hastily."}
{"text":"i don't even know where to start...i ordered through the yelp app and i called to confirm my order. they said delivery was in 45 mins. an hour later i called to find out where my food was and they said it was on its way. another hour later i called again to cancel my order she said please just give it a try and i said. i ordered 2 hours ago. im starving...the guy arrived. 30 minutes later. said he had gotten lost. i didn't tip but i paid for the food. which was wrong anyways and guess what? it was piping hot. they had just made it. i asked for noodles with vegetable. i got rice and vegetables and it was mushy. i was craving noodles and that completely ruined my meal. the food was tasteless and i will never order from this restaurant again. cheap and not worth it."}
{"text":"Not good. Don't waste your time. As I've said in prior reviews, I love tying new Chinese places and will continue to. I don't think I'll be coming back to Mr. Cooks. The Low mein was decent but the Orange chicken was gross. Very bready and sauce was red. Tasted like they may freeze everything and re heat? Not sure but not good. I didn't find a bug or anything, the food just isn't good. Judge for yourself if you want to be disappointed."}
{"text":"I order from here 05-13-17 for delivery.. I ordered 2 meals and got one rice..I ordered for delivery and had to go down and meet the driver to get my food..delivery is to my door not me going to the driver.the food was pretty good..but due to the missing rice and lazy driver won't go there again"}
{"text":"I have a tough time finding good Chinese food that is consistent. Mr Cooks has awesome low main while it's really oily it's also suuuuper tasty!!! Not a fan or their fried rice it tasted and looked like it was cooked in a microwave with little flavor. The pot stickers were amazing and while my egg rolls were good they aren't very full will little stuffed inside. Oh and all the sauces were delivered very cold as if they had just com out of the refrigerator."}
{"text":"I found my new to-go place for Chinese food. I have gotten a few things on their menu and have been happy with everything. I like how you can see them cooking in the back. The cashiers aren't the brightest, so be patient. Also, make sure if you ask for brown rice, they give it to you. Otherwise, really delicious food."}
{"text":"We have eaten here at least 5 times, lately The Food is average, but, the service is getting worst. Tonight we placed a order for Delivery, After 55 min, we call them. the Guy who answered the phone, says he dont have any order with that name or #. WTF. Then we get a phone  callback and he tells me our order is sitting on the counter waiting for pick up. we tell them no thank you its cold by Now. Never in our history have we done a pick up.  then i get a call from a woman, shes says they will make it fresh and have it there in 20 min. we say ok. 15 min later ding dong your cold food is here... No More Never again"}
{"text":"Fairly good--the food tastes a bit over cooked and grease but that's kind of how Chinese take out food is. They have generous portion sizes but are a little bit more pricey than expected. The thing that made me upset was it took 60mins for my food to arrive on a Tuesday night! Very log wait-might try again but not sure it's worth it."}
{"text":"We tried their delivery service on day after Thanksgiving.  It was getting late and we were too tired to cook or drive out somewhere for a take out.  We found the menu of this restaurant taped at our front door, and placed an order without expecting much.  Boy, were we wrong!  The nice young man showed up at our door in less than 20 minutes.  I had broccoli and chicken and my hubby had egg rolls and chicken lo mein.  All were very tasty.  They were neither greasy or overly salty, and portions were quite generous.  Solid 4 stars.  We will definitely be trying this place again for delivery or take out."}
{"text":"PLEASE STOP LEAVING YOUR MENU'S AT MY DOOR.  Approximately for 18 months you have left unwanted menu's at my front door.   Mr. Cooks \"salesmen\" that go door-to-door soliciting (what appears to be gross food via reviews), humor me. Viewing my camera, the solicitors look directly at the sign (presumably attempt to sound out no so-li-ci-ting) and STILL put the tape and menu.   I will not eat at your restaurant, I promise you this. So PLEASE STOP putting your menu's on EVERY door that says NO SOLICITING.   You are only hurting your business reviews for soliciting unwanted patrons who have NEVER even tried the food."}
{"text":"Love this place. They deliver for a reasonable fee! The food is delicious. The veggies are always fresh and all of the dishes taste as they should. I hate going to get Chinese food and it has no flavor or everything tastes the same. This place was not that. The egg drop soup was perfect when I was sick. The portion sizes are pretty good too."}
{"text":"Our first time ordering yesterday fast and accurate delivery the beef Egg Foo Yung was fabulous, huge and tasty!  Shrimp with Garlic Sauce was delicious and we really enjoyed our meal!"}
{"text":"Let me start with the customer service. The worst customer service I've had, the lady I was talking to was chatting away on her cell phone. The lady comes to the register after a good 15 minutes of just standing there while talking on the phone (by the way we were looking at her and my husband said \"I'll have the mongolian beef\") then she saids order? Lol. It's like hello we were ready to order! She takes our order then my husband gives her the $$ in her hand she places the change on the counter (I hate when people do that I just feel like it's rude) then walks away. We wait for our order then I decide I don't want to eat in so I approach the counter and say excuse me, excuse me, excuse me, hello? Hello excuse me! And nothing I get ignored by her and kitchen staff. Finally she looks at me and I tell her I would like this order to go instead. She saids ok and I go back to sitting down and waiting for our order. I waited for 10-15 minutes for our food. Now for the food part which I figured what the heck bad customer service I can work around that since they have delivery service I won't have to deal with the rudeness. I had the shrimp fried rice and let me say bland, boring, and no taste at all! I don't even think it had seasoning. I was so hungry and don't like to waste food so I try to make it eatable by adding salt, pepper, soy sauce, and siracha. Let me just say last time I ever eat from this place. If you like rude customer service and you like to enjoy bland boring food then stop searching this place is the right place for you!"}
{"text":"They've left their flyer/menu on our gate many times since we've moved into the neighborhood. I'm just sad that we didn't try this place sooner!! It's definitely a good place to order take out from if you're wanting some tasty Chinese food. From the outside of the venue, it looks like nothing special. Dingy and kinda beat up. The inside isn't any better. The food definitely takes all.  We erred on the side of caution and got all small orders. We had the veggie lo mein, stir fry green bean, and broccoli and tofu medley. These three items were enough for the both of us and we even had some left over. Everything was really good. My only complaint is that while the food was really nice and saucy...it was a bit much. The sodium could e toned down a bit. Luckily, this place was fairly vegetarian friendly...at super reasonable prices too! For all three items, I spent $19, not including tip. When I went to pick up my order (they told me 15 min) it was ready and still hot. They had a bunch of orders alongside mine. They managed to keep things in order and they even followed through with my request of no onions!!! Most places mess that up.   I was thrilled about how great my first experience was here. You bet we'll be ordering from here again.   PS they have a self serve sauce, utensil, and fortune cookie section. It's the small things."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a late lunch here on a Saturday afternoon.  Both of our meals had plenty of fresh vegetables and were generously proportioned, but beyond that they weren't anything remarkable.  The menu is about as standard as you can get.  There's no public restroom.  And the dining area is cluttered with restaurant supplies.  This restaurant feels/looks like a worn out old business that doesn't take a lot of pride in itself."}
{"text":"Family had told us about a dive chinese place we were all in!  We ordered 11 lunch specials for a football Sunday.  All of them were correct and great! The price was right also, around $6.  There was plenty of food to share and we had some leftovers and lunch the next day.  The wonton soup was a little flavorless, the eggdrop was great. The order was ready within the 10mins to drive there.  Yes, this is an old taco bell and they store stuff in the dining area.   The only this I would say that could need improvment are the eggrolls or spring rolls.  They were kind of bland.  That is part of a great chinese place IMO. We have a go to Chinese place when we visit now."}
{"text":"Went here today for the first time. And the last. Can't decide what was worse. The space stacked with stuff everywhere. The food from the greasy egg roll to the porkless pork lo mein to the odd tasting mushy fried rice. Or the service which after my third attempt to get my order still didn't have a clue. Don't waste your time. This place should be called Mr. Can't Cooks."}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised. Food was good and plenty. Not much room for dine in so pick up or delivery is a must."}
{"text":"Meh. I won't be ordering from this location again. I had their sweet and sour pork and it was bland. The sauce added nothing to the pork. The rice was over-cooked. I also had steamed dumplings; they were over-cooked."}
{"text":"I decided one day to order mr. Cooks after a menu on my front door. I had not looked at the yelp, nor looked at the \"decor\" because that doesn't matter to me. Taste of food matters. This is my second time ordering the food and it is beyond amazing. Every restaurant that just opens has a little rough patch. People who judge a place after 1 try the second week it opens are ignorant. I love the mein fun with wok shrimp. AMAZING.   After reading negative yelp reviews I realized that they come from people who have never had a job in a restaurant. You aren't ordering from a 5 star New York restaurant that p diddy visits.. Your ordering from a local restaurant. Get over it and support."}
{"text":"At first the quality was good, but I changed my mind after a few visits. You can't both rise prices and put less food on plate. Quality dropped too. I will have to look for a new place."}
{"text":"The absolute worst take out experience I ever had. I placed an order and illustrated I want my food spicy several times. It got to my house, I tried it, and realized not only it wasn't spicy, it had no flavor and extremely mild. I called the place back and the lady started yelling on the phone to me and then said \"fuck you\". I will make it my mission to get this place shut down"}
{"text":"Ordered as delivery through Yelp/Eat24. The food was very good and my significant other was pleased. I was a bit concerned since I ordered near their closing time, but I was surprised with the flavor, temperature, and packaging for takeout. Would order again.   The prices seem a bit high, but as long as quality doesn't slip, it's a good value."}
{"text":"Too many things wrong, not worth my time to write. And you shouldn't waste your time here."}
{"text":"Mister Cook's Chinese Cuisine is located in a clearly recognizable circa 1970's Taco Bell structure. Worse yet, in a Big Lots parking lot! That said, Mister Cook's seems to be a very promising successor to the Asian restaurant previously housed at this location.   I'm probably being a little generous with a five star review, but I wanted to get your attention. The ambiance does leave a little bit to be desired. I think they are still using the original Taco Bell seating! You order at the counter and food is served to you on a Styrofoam plate on a red plastic tray. You have your choice of chop sticks or plastic utensils. Mister Cook's is all about the food. And I'm fine with that!  I love all the dishes I've tried (so far). The menu is pretty standard Americanized Chinese, with all the usual items included. They do have a \"Diet Menu\" with five choices. And a $7.45 per person dinner special. They have a nice lunch special, served daily 11:00 - 3:00, priced at $5.25 - $6.35, depending on your main dish, served with rice and soup. I started with the Kung Pao Chicken and plan on working my way through the rest of the menu over time.  Mister Cook's is open seven days a week. They also offer take out and delivery. I'm looking forward to returning and hope to see the early opinions of some other Yelpers as well."}
{"text":"The delivery service is a separate company called Beyond Menu that delivers Mr Cook's orders. I've never had an issue with their delivery, but everyone has a different experience. We really  like Mr Cook's food. Everything is cooked fresh to order and its very reasonably priced. For fast Chinese, I prefer it over Panda Express and a lot less expensive."}
{"text":"I ordered online with Yelp. It was delivered relatively quickly and the order was correct. I ordered spicy chicken and it was pretty bland. The food seemed fresh and I might try another dish to give it another shot."}
{"text":"Wish I could give this place zero stars!! Worst customer service I have every experienced. I went in to pick up the food I ordered. Staff seemed frantic and clueless. They gave me my food and ran my credit card. I made the big mistake of not checking to see if the order was right. I'm driving home, and as I was pulling up to my house I receive a call from Mr Cooks asking if I could check my order because they thought I had the wrong bag. Sure enough, I had the wrong order. The girl asked if I could BRING IT BACK TO THE RESTAURANT! Because it was the holiday season, I guess I was feeling generous so I went back to the restaurant thinking okay they're going to give me my food and probably comp it for coming back. Nope, I arrived at the restaurant and they gave me my food without a sorry or an offer of anything for the inconvenience.  More than anything, I feel sorry for the people who are going to receive the food that was now 30 minutes old and had been traveled around Phoenix.  Mr Cooks is clearly cheap and don't care about customer service in the slightest. Never been so appalled in my entire life."}
{"text":"We ordered from here a couple nights ago and they delivered our food within 30 minutes! It was very fast and everything tasted good. We got the hunan chicken, sweet and sour chicken, and fried rice. We will order from here again because they are so efficient!"}
{"text":"We order the cheese won tons, orange chicken and house lo mein...my favorite is the hot & spicy shrimp.  It's consistently good, I love that they deliver and they are pretty fast.  It's hard to find good Chinese food in Phoenix, it's not my favorite Chinese but it is my favorite Chinese that delivers to my house...and there is something to be said about that on a lazy night!  They deliver pretty late too which is awesome for us!!"}
{"text":"If there was a no star review this is what I would give this place. I am a native of az and have pretty much eaten at the local good spots. However, was in a rush with a friend. The food was literally sitting in some goo sauce that was flavorless.  It's by fare the worst Chinese food place around. Don't waste your money"}
{"text":"Got some take-out from here. The sauce on the General Tso's chicken was good, and a bit spicier than most places that I've had it, but the chicken they used wasn't great.  The hot & sour soup was good but it was a pretty small portion. Didn't notice when I ordered that no egg roll was served with the lunch combo."}
{"text":"So despite some of the other reviews I had a great experience here! I got one of their menus put on my door and called them the following Sunday to order delivery. The person on the phone was nice and quick, read my order back to me to make sure it was accurate which is something I love! The quoted me 45 minutes and came right at 40 minutes. Our delivery girl was so nice and awesome!! We ordered the orange chicken special, Hunan chicken, and steamed dumplings. All the food was bomb. The orange chicken was lightly breaded and the veggies were so fresh. The Hunan chicken had the perfect amount of spice and also lots of fresh veggies, even tasted healthier then other deliveries I've had, wasn't greasy. And the steamed dumplings were the best part... I didn't want to share! I would highly recommend this place for quick, easy, tasty delivery!"}
{"text":"Great food! They always deliver fast and the food always arrives hot and fresh. Their delivery charge is minimal, and they are nice. They lose a star for a couple of reasons. They always forget napkins and cutlery / chopsticks, and their eggrolls are very unimpressive-also once ordered spring rolls and got those icky eggrolls instead."}
{"text":"Let's start with this first I have been eating at this pace since high school in 1990's  we'll know as the toilet bowl because they didn't have restrooms  actually they still don't strange huh, it has change ownership a few times I actually like the food maybe it's nostalgia, I order the same thing every time!!  it's like a high school run I get my stuff from aqua touch across the street then pick up parts from franks hobby bench the my order that's all I got to say check it out see what you think, that's my two cents thanks!!"}
{"text":"Great prices, fast delivery (even during a monsoon), friendly service both when placing order and at delivery. Food was hot, plentiful and tasty."}
{"text":"Very greasy Chinese food, cheap quality, poor quantity, not a good experience. Felt like done junk ghetto Chinese outlet restaurant. Think before you eat their food. We went with Chicken Fried rice, Chicken Lo Mein, Hunan Chicken."}
{"text":"I would not eat here again if the food was free.  I am by no means a picky eater but i ate in with 1 other person and no other customers.  My friend got their food 10 minutes before me and they forgot about the soup until after the food came.  I got the sesame chicken and have never had the sauce gloopy and a burnt red color it was gross.  The other persons pork was nothing but fat chunks and inedible.  One thing going for them is the prices are cheap and the portions are big but with most of the food not being edible it is not really worth it anyways."}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical of this little shop when I first saw it driving by and had no idea what it was.... I still remember when it was a Taco Bell when I was a little girl! Let me tell you I was pleasantly surprised when i chose them for Chinese takeout night this week. I ordered two egg rolls,which I usually don't like at most places, sweet and sour chicken dinner with a side of veggie lo mein. I loved everything and especially the egg rolls. They initially told me it may take up to 45 minutes and I was like okayyyyy but it arrived in about 15 minutes hot and steaming and really yummy! Thank you for feeding me! I will be ordering from here again real soon, definitely one of those gems you stumble upon!!!"}
{"text":"I came, I ate...... by the end......la cucarachas... this place was filthier than a Saigon whores a$#hole. I'd rather eat off Andre the giants dead taint, before I eat here again."}
{"text":"Food was unremarkable.  Not bad but nothing to right home about either. I was one of five in our party and two hours after four of us had been sick. Do not reccommend."}
