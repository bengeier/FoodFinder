{"text":"Great food and great service. It's always good when the staff knows you by name and know what you went to eat for lunch. Veggies and salads are always fresh and the homemade dressings are always delicious."}
{"text":"My family and I had lunch here today. It was fantastic! The service was very friendly and the Owner was so helpful since it was our first visit there. My husband had the turkey bacon ranch wrap and he loved it. I had the club sandwich and it was also very good. From the soup to the fries we were very impressed. We got a free cookie for checking in and they were delicious! You don't get home made cookies very often and wow, they were good! It's kind of hard to find and they close at three, but it's well worth the trip for lunch some day if your looking for a great lunch experience."}
{"text":"Hard to find.. basically an office building cafe.. ordered italian sub wrap to go.. got extra fillings in it I did not want or asked for.. one and done.."}
{"text":"Southwestern wrap is the best breakfast burrito I've had in some time. And at $5 it is a bargain! Looking forward to trying more from their menu. The restaurant is spacious and has an outdoor dining area also. Staff is friendly and hard working."}
{"text":"Since the place changed ownership the service is slow and the food is not as good as it was when Kelly owned and ran the place. I will not come back. I also saw the cook in the back cut raw chicken on the same board they were making sandwiches."}
{"text":"Try the bacon, egg, and cheese croissant. It is fresh and delicious! The coffee is great too."}
{"text":"Excellent place for lunch, food is fresh prepared and can taste the difference, light atmosphere and comfortable, good price too, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I don't know how to rate them. The hours are not correct on yelp. Only open Monday thru Friday 7-3. I came on a Saturday even though it was an office building. I was hopeful they were open based on the reviews and menu. I drove in from SC."}
{"text":"After passing this business several times I finally heard from the security in our business park that it was \"banging\" so I finally took the plunge and tried it today. I ordered a Chef's Salad and a Pink Lemonade...  IT WAS AMAZING. The portion is SUPER HUGE and all of the food is fresh and great tasting. They make the ranch from scratch and Samantha even brought me extra ranch and a jug of pink lemonade. I devoured about 5 forkfuls before I was so stuffed I left with a huge to go box of leftovers for dinner. I also tried the CRACK cookie and it was really good. The price is worth the quality of the food and the service you receive. Even the cooks in the back were kind enough to ask me how my food was and if i needed anything else!"}
{"text":"Been in town for business all week, eatting overpriced so so meals at my overpriced hotel. Found menus on Yelp with the highest rating in the area.  Pleasantly pleased to find a heart healty breakfast option at an affordable price.   I will be bragging about the quiet relaxing atmosphere and chef quality meal in tge morning meeting.  THANKS"}
{"text":"Food was excellent and so was the service. Would definitely go back. Not busy at all for lunch. The mustard sauce in the chicken wrap was amazing."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. They went outside their norm and made us breakfast after 10am and it was delicious. Great family business."}
{"text":"Very good food! We got 3 different sandwiches & all were great.  Service was also on par and very fast.  So glad we decided to go off the beaten path!"}
{"text":"I picked this restaurant based on previous reviews and the proximity to the airport. My husband said that \"never again\". The coffee was mediocre at best. The Hot tea his associate was having wasn't even close to HOT. That the food wasn't much better. Worst part was that he said the staff were grouchy and had bad attitudes. First time Yelp failed me. Who wrote these reviews? The owners??"}
{"text":"Care and love went into my salad, from the fresh ingredients, home made dressing and the personal friendly service, a great lunch made by great people. When you find a nice, privately owned cafe,  eat there often! It is hard for the small business owners to compete with the mega corporate \"Paneras\". I'll be back again soon."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant in the heart of the office park. I found it on accident coming into the complex and was definitely happy I stopped by for lunch. The grilled chicken salad was top notch and the portions were very generous! Definitely will stop by if I am there again."}
{"text":"The chicken bacon ranch wrap was excellent. The chicken was warm and had good flavor. The homemade chips were very tasty, but a few of them were a bit soggy. Service was quick."}
{"text":"My family ate breakfast here on the morning we needed to head home after having to evacuate from hurricane Irma. We wanted a satisfying and hearty breakfast knowing we'd be on the road for a long time dealing with the traffic of everyone trying to get home. We chose this placed based on the close proximity to our hotel, good Yelp reviews and yummy looking photos of their menu items. When we arrived, we thought the place wasn't open. The large refrigerated display cases at the front were completely empty and there went any other patrons at 9:40am. The person at the front had an attitude when directing us to sit at a table--far from inviting. Our waitress seemed to know nothing about the menu--constantly needed to ask someone in the kitchen to answer our simple inquiries. They didn't have any kind of juice. Not even orange juice (odd, for a place that serves breakfast). The coffee tasted fine but was luke-warm. The grits were cold and lumpy. The breakfast potatoes were completely burnt and mushy and looked absolutely nothing like the potatoes pictured on Yelp (which was part of the reason we chose to come here). The Diet Coke was flat and very watered down. The piece of ham in my ham and cheese croissant was maybe half the size of the croissant and looked and tasted like it was old and reheated multiple times. The croissant itself was the only decent thing about all of our meals--it was a generous size and tasted great. It's really frustrating having to rely on online reviews when we are forced to stay in an unfamiliar place and find that the establishment doesn't reflect the positive remarks in the slightest. The positive reviews must have been written by the owners or their management has recently gone completely downhill. We left disappointed and unsatisfied. I hope this review helps patrons find a better place to eat and motivates the management to hold a higher standard for their restaurant's food quality and customer service."}
{"text":"Family ran restaurant in a business park off Old Pineville.  The location is ideal especially to cater to the park tenants.  There's just one problem:  there ain't any, at least nearby.  A bonus is plenty of parking.  Consequently, when I arrived for breakfast around 9 AM, I was the only one there.  Mary, the owner's daughter, happily greeted me like other Yelper's stated.  Going forward things went well even if they had sold out of some basics, like biscuits.  The sourdough toast was a happy substitute.  And I was comped a free coffee to boot.  Nice touch.  Menu's has been in this location for about a year.  I can't tell if they'll make it or not.  The park is up for redevelopment so maybe it will help ring the register.  Until then, if you're a fan, go and support this one-off caf√© in South Charlotte."}
{"text":"I loved the atmosphere of the restaurant! I didn't love the food but it doesn't mean it wasn't amazing, I'm just not a \"southern\" breakfast kind of girl. I enjoyed it"}
{"text":"This is a really great place to have lunch. The food is always made to order. They always have a daily special. I highly recommend the homemade chips."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Seems like a lot of business ppl come here since it is in an office park but don't be fooled. Fresh, healthy and fast."}
{"text":"A little \"Hole in the Wall\" establishment offering basic GOOD food at very reasonable prices. If this place wasn't buried in a business park it would be packed daily."}
{"text":"Made the mistake of ordering delivery from this restaurant. First, their delivery fee is more expensive than the listed price. Second I was served a quesadilla with a green tortilla and the tiniest side of guacamole. And $7 for just a quesadilla is ridiculous. No side of chips or anything.  Also ordered a chicken salad and it was decent. An extra star for the fact that this restaurant uses mixed greens and not garbage iceberg lettuce. Would not go back."}
{"text":"Everything I've tried so far on the lunch menu has been tasty, minus the tomato bisque. For some reason today it was tomato water but my sandwich made up for it. The grown up grilled cheese which is a housemade pimento cheese with bacon, tomatoes and jalapenos definitely does NOT taste like the pimento cheese I had as a kid. I loved it. Grilled Reuben is another favorite. Honestly they could put anything between that buttery, grilled bread and I'd probably eat it. I'll continue to grab a bite from Menus in the future when I can..."}
{"text":"Good Food... Weird Location.  Don't let the location on the map folks you, this little spot is good.  It's in the heart of an office complex that isn't the most prestigious.  I got the grown up grilled cheese and loved it.  It was pretty greasy, but that didn't stop me from inhaling it until I felt sick.  I would recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"This place has two locations and the location at Red Oak recently closed, which was really disappointing. I still recommend you visit the other location nearby. The philly cheesesteak is seriously the best I've ever had and I lived in Philly for a year! The homemade buffalo chips are to die for and the BLT is incredible. Everything is made to order and the people are very friendly. The Red Oak blvd. location is now occupied by another restaurant that is not nearly as good :( Come back Menus! We miss you and your phillies!"}
{"text":"Have been there several times, could not believe I had not written a review yet!!! The food is fresh, and good, the service is above and beyond, they always give you a drink to check on to make sure the food is okay, have had breakfast, items from the take and bake menu, sandwiches, and the specials.  The warm home made chips are great, as is everything I have had there.  Mary and Samantha make you feel at home!!! My favorite, SO FAR, has been the Shepherd's Pie from the take and bake, it is all very good!!!!"}
{"text":"I had a very pleasant meal here today! A Georgia Rueben and fries. This little place has diner heart. Everything is cooked with homestyle flair. The food had good flavor, the portion wasn't too big, and everything was hot. The service was very good and the owners seem to be heavily involved in the business. This was just good comforting food without a lot of flair. This is a great place to have a simple lunch and just take a few minutes to relax and eat."}
{"text":"Hard to find, but the reviews looked good, so I persevered.  Staff all quiet pleasant and relaxed.  Had sausage & eggs. Eggs were fine, but the single sausage patty was very cheap tasting quality.   Overall a grade of \"Fair.\" Wanted to give better grade as they're so nice, but that sausage really is sad."}
{"text":"I loooooooove this place!!! From the daily made fresh soups, homeade cookies, awesome prices and delicious food, it's an all in one spot for good food, convenience and nice people. It's right down the street and I recommend everyone come here. Sometimes I have to wait a little bit during lunch rush but I realize since everything is made to order it's absolutely acceptable and I don't mind waiting a few minutes. Also, (lady with the brown hair makes the best food :)) not sure if she's an owner or just works there but she always makes my order consistent and delicious!! Definitely visit here multiple times a week and will be back again and again!!"}
{"text":"Good breakfast wraps and wraps for lunch. Staff isn't always friendly. Quick food and good quality. My fav fast and local lunch spot"}
{"text":"I honestly look forward to lunch everyday - the Cafe on Red Oak is in our office park in South Charlotte, and they serve the best lunch and breakfast of any restaurant around.  If you work in any of the many office complexes in South Charlotte, I highly recommend checking them out for lunch, breakfast or a snack, everything I've had here is phenomenal."}
{"text":"Thank you YELPERS for highlighting this somewhat hidden gem.  Fantastic service and flavorful food that is on point.  I have been here twice and have tried two breakfast items: croissant sandwich with bacon and southwestern wrap. Both were great, but the wrap stole my hungry !!  YUM, YUM GIMME SOME!!!  They cater and apparently have a thriving take and bake service.  Also, supporting Paleo and Whole 30 peeps with take and bake options. Can't wait to try lunch."}
{"text":"Little hidden gem of a cafe in oak hill business park. If your near def worth it to stop in. From the front entrance go down the stairs and to the right. Can also park around the right side of the building (down a small hill) cafe is to the left. Healthy wrap is awesome, very fresh ingredients and friendly folks."}
