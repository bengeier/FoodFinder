{"text":"Food was good. Service was OK. Liked the atmosphere. We sat outside and it started off well, but maybe they got slammed or something because our service suffered severely after."}
{"text":"We live nearby and absolutely love this place. Food, patio, servers, awesome!! Love to come here but cannot take the music. We go fairly early and the clientele is around 50. People at the next table mentioned the music and another couple left without ordering. (Might have been something else.) I have 2 daughters in their 30's and they thought music was annoying too. I want to keep coming but the music is ruining our experience. Please give it some thoughts owners, I beg you!"}
{"text":"It's so sad; this place had such promise.  I used to come here once a week for their specials.  They were always imaginative and never failed to make me feel like I was eating at a five-star restaurant.   Unfortunately,  this seems to have gone the way of the dire wolf, as the last few times I have been here, they seem to have reverted to an average restaurant in the middle of nowhere.  Hope they figure things out soon... businesses do not usually last in this location."}
{"text":"Wow.  Fantastic food. I had a grilled cheese and the tomato bisque.  Wife and kid split the fish sandwich dinner.  Fries were excellent.  Beers were priced well and the service was just as good.  Jarrod was our server and he was great.  Didn't have the pizza, but saw it...looked killer.  Will try it next time."}
{"text":"Love this place! Very nice clean extra detail on the decor. Food was great nice wine & cocktail list. Service was good. I usually go to wright place but not anymore!"}
{"text":"I want to give 5 stars but the food has been so inconsistent since they opened. After tonight's meal I don't think I will be eating here anymore. I ordered the BLT and the bacon was over cooked and the lettuce and tomato were not fresh. The risotto was dry white rice, corn and some melted cheese thrown on it. No where near the consistency of a creamy risotto-it was literally a side of rice.  I also ate here this past Tuesday and my Swiss burger was charred so badly that I could hardly eat it. However, the risotto was fabulous that night.  I love the location, the gluten free options and it something different than just going to firehouse or wright place all the time. I just wish their kitchen would put out consistent dishes."}
{"text":"If I could give these people a negative rating, I would!  Perfectly awful experience all the way around.  The service:  DEPLORABLE!!!  The \"new\" menu?!!  One new item, maybe two!  Sorely understaffed!!  We waited over an hour for our food and it was mediocre at best!  Such a disappointment - will NEVER go back!!!  Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"I've been here once before since it changed hands for dinner and had a great meal with good service. This time we went for lunch. We both had burgers and really loved them. The Tavern is a basic cheeseburger with lettuce tomato onion and pickle slices but fresh and a nice size. The bun was good and the sandwich didn't fall apart which I appreciate. My companion had the featured burger of the day and felt the same way.  The burgers come with home-made chips which are often tasteless but these were perfectly seasoned. My side of Cole slaw was also fresh and a generous portion. The service was friendly and attentive. I plan to come more often especially with the great patio."}
{"text":"Stopped here after a visit to Holden Arboretum with the family. The food was delicious and the service was awesome. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Bacon blue burger is my favorite. Live the sweet potato fries. Never have been disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner last night. We had jerk chicken and pork chops. We both liked our meals and would come back. The atmosphere was nice. The bartender, I think his name is Ryan was very friendly....introduced himself and asked our names. He called us by our names when asking if we needed any more drinks or how our meals were. It's a nice touch, makes you feel like you've been there before. Save room for the cupcakes. So good! I jokingly said I wanted a big glass of milk to wash it down and he offered to get me one. Lol We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I live right down the street from this restaurant and eat lunch/dinner here at least twice a week. Their food is absolutely delicious, but unfortunately their service doesn't match up. Anytime they are the slightest bit busy, plan on waiting 15 minutes for a drink and over an hour for your meal.  If you have a large party or young children, plan on keeping them entertained for a while. I understand this is a restaurant in the burbs so things should be a little more relaxed, but they have a few servers who just collecting tips and could care less about their customers. I just want to reiterate that the food and atmosphere is fantastic at the tavern. I am hopeful that management will identify and fix the lackluster service, because this place has everything else going for them."}
{"text":"Great place,Great food especially  the salmon..The service and staff are wonderfil.and who can beat a cupcake a day. Looking forward to  the summer patio."}
{"text":"Absolutely gorgeous on the inside.  Friendly staff, extensive menu, and a beautiful bar.  Plenty of beer on tap, ranging from Yuengling to Great Lakes to Kentucky Bourbon Ale.  Will be an asset to Kirtland and the surrounding area.  Perfect for stopping by if you're in the area on your way home from work.  Will be back often."}
{"text":"After being quoted 25 minutes for a table, after an HR and a half we never got seated and left.! Food is good but not worth the terrible service!"}
{"text":"Burger was just about ok, wings were terrible and badly under cooked, service was even worse. Really disappointed, won't be back."}
{"text":"Great dinner and drinks. Owner was very accommodating in adapting a few meals for our vegan palates. Spinach salad modified with fresh fruit of the day, the bean burger. Hummus, and fresh cut fries were all great. Try the vodka and mint drink on the cocktail menu."}
{"text":"The food was great but service was a big let down.  My wife and I were seated at 6 PM and waited fifteen minutes later a for a server to come by.  We ordered two beers which arrived reasonably on time.  We sipped our beer while waiting  for the server to come back for our order.  20 minutes later he showed up.  We waited another 30 minutes for our food to arrive.  There was only one server who covered both the dining room and the bar.  I asked him if this is normal and he said they had a couple of large parties (which we didn't see) and he didn't apologize for the long wait time.  When the food finally arrived, our complaints stopped.  My wife had a Cobb salad and I the fish dinner.  Both were excellent.  So, bottom line... 5 stars for the food but 1 star for the service.  Hopefully they will fix this."}
{"text":"I first heard of Tavern Six when I attended an event a few years ago and had one of their desserts.  I always filed it away in the back of my head, and tonight was the night to finally go check it out.  Lots of interesting specials greeted us upon entering the restaurant.  The overall experience was terrific, top to bottom. Bar service was friendly and very good. We sat down to eat dinner after waiting 30 min on a Friday night around 7pm. No problem--they had a packed house, and that is always a good sign.  Felecia was a very cute, smiling server who did an outstanding job.  Our food was very, very good. My fish sandwich was the best I have ever had in a restaurant. As a personal preference, I am not a fan of dill, so the dill tartar sauce wasn't appealing to me but nonetheless it tasted good.  I am old school and like relish and mayo but kudos to them for elevating the tartar sauce experience.  My son loved his breakfast burger, and hubs loves his Mac and cheese.  Fries were killer, too.  This is our new favorite place. Great atmosphere, great age range of people, delicious food, excellent service. Dig it.  And very inexpensive. Dinner for 3 was $55 before tip. Because Felecia was so good (and because I have a soft spot in my heart for young people who do a very good job) I tipped her 30%.  And she earned it!  We will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Nice place, friendly and efficient staff, good soup, but probably one of the worst quesadillas I have ever had.  For the price, very thin, mainly all tortilla, lacking a lot of meat and filling and too dry."}
{"text":"Food is good, service is fast, drinks are amazing.  Prices are alittle high but not unreasonable. We will be back again, really hope this place hangs in!!!"}
{"text":"went here with my entire family including out of towners. nice local bar and grill. my family was so happy with the service and food. our food ranged from burgers to wraps and salads. everyone was great. the owner was bussing our table too. we had 10 people. I made reservations and the table was ready when I walked in and I was early. I recommend this place to anyone. our servers Rachel and I cant remember the main serves name were so accommodating to all of us. great place, good food and good prices"}
{"text":"I had the fish dinner, excellent! The wife had the chicken salad, excellent! We were served by a young man by the name Steve. Friendly,  polite and attentive. Same kid a reviewer named Nicholas blasted. Maybe he had a bad night, nothing like nick described. no need to call people bad words on here nickky. Btw gave the kid double 40 percent tip to make up for you. maybe you should take your own advice and Stay blessed not stressed."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this newest try at this location. We arrived about 7:30 and stood waiting for about five minutes.  A waitress saw us, did not acknowledge us and ducked into the kitchen. Finally we seated ourselves. After another long wait, the same waitress reappeared, went to the one other occupied table and finally came over to greet us and provide menus, etc.  The bar area and outside seating seemed busier and she appeared to be the only employee other than the bartender. I ordered the tomato bisque which was served barely warm and a pulled pork sandwich which was nothing special. My partner ordered the grilled chicken with the risotto of the day (carrot and honey). The chicken and risotto were best characterized as bland. Our waitress appeared once more and then brought the check. I was totally disappointed. We might give it one more try."}
{"text":"We were looking for a new place to try and Tavern Six in Kirtland was suggested by a friend.  We were there on a Friday night and it was busy!  We had to wait a little while for a table but we were glad we did.  The bar was packed and it seemed like a lot of regulars but everyone was having a good time.  I had a veggie sandwich and my friend had a burger.  Both meals were very good and priced well.  Even though it was busy, the server was very responsive and friendly and we didn't feel rushed at all.  If you are ever in the Kirtland area, give Taven Six a try!"}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Kirtland! Love their wings and mac n cheese and they were so accommodating to our little one!"}
{"text":"The service here has come a long way. Great people, Great Menu, Great Food, Great Beer. Bodhi on draft!"}
{"text":"The chef seems a bit inexperienced. The sweet potato skins were not crunchy and not loaded with cheese or bacon. The kale in the kale salad was old and because of that the salad became inedible. The wings and the cherry chipotle sauce were very good. The place is clean and the service is fine. I don't think I will be back unless I am craving a burger."}
{"text":"Great food (haven't had anything I didn't love) and service! And the cupcakes are SOO good!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the atmosphere, the beer and the fabulous steak dinner. You can't go wrong with food or drink here."}
{"text":"Wish I would have checked this place out sooner!! Good beer selection, good appetizers, and Really great bartender Ryan. I will be back!!"}
{"text":"The service is very friendly and professional.  The food was very good.  I had the cherry chipotle pulled pork, which was among the best I've had.  My date had the grilled marinated chicken- two very tender and delicious breasts that were very juicy.  We shared a couple really good cupcakes for dessert, but they could have a bit more cake, and a little less icing.  Too bad we are visiting from Columbus, or we would come back again soon!"}
{"text":"I didn't order a full meal, but I will definitely be back to try it again in the future!  I stopped to meet friends and had drinks and one of the amazing spice cake cup cakes.  Our server was having a difficult shift, but she more than made up for it in her kindness and service for our party.    The patio is huge, which is rare for a Kirtland bar/restaurant.  I didn't pay much attention to inside as I just passed through.  Great addition to the restaurant scene, and from what I did see on the menu it offers some unique options!"}
{"text":"Went here for a date. He turned out to be a regrettable, lame, ass hat, but at least the burger I got at Tavern Six did not disappoint and my night was not a complete waste of a time.  I tried the Breakfast burger ($12) and the Tek's Mex ($11) one, both were good along with the fresh cut fries ($2 extra) and house chips. Every dish that I saw the waiter bring out looked tasty. Beer selection wasn't bad either. It did seem a bit busy inside so service was kind of slow, but that's totally understandable. Seating was a little snug with our table right at the bottom of some steps, but it wasn't too awful especially since I had two tv's to look at instead of my date.  I'd check this place out again if I was in the area, would just definitely not recommend meeting up with guys named Nolan on Tinder though. You're best off just bringing your cat as your date and sitting at the bar."}
{"text":"Disappointed.  We came from out of town. They weren't open on Memorial day, but gave no indication.  It wasn't listed on their website.  Called the restaurant and the number went to a fax #.  Then stopped by and no sign on the door indicating they wouldn't be open, just locked doors.   We were really looking forward to going after a visit to the Arboretum."}
{"text":"This was the worst dining experience of my life!!!!  I saw one waiter have to take care of the dining room and bar!  It took an hour to get our food and the order was wrong.  They forgot my husband's order all together!!!  These owners need to hire enough staff to take care of their customers!!"}
{"text":"Great tavern! There are several different areas. When you walk in, the ambiance is rustic, warm and welcoming with a huge brick fireplace. The two mounted TVs give you a view from any seat. This leads into a large bar with a good selection of liquor, beer and wine. There are a few TVs behind the bar. The ceiling tiles are black tin and set low to add to the coziness. The back wall here is lined with booth seating. Continue thru the bar & you'll find a more casual dining room with smaller TVs, tables and darts. There's a back door out to a patio and a few different decks with seating and large TVs and another large outdoor bar.    The staff was efficient and friendly working throughout all the spaces the weeknight we were there. The food was delicious. We had the wings. They were naked style and cooked crispy. The sauce was flavorful and the blue cheese was homemade. The fries were fresh cut and seasoned nicely, had them with a side of homemade ranch. Loved them. The burger was cooked perfectly medium. It was juicy and seasoned nicely. The menu was upscale bar food at great prices. They also had an impressive selection of dinners and a daily cupcake!   The place was clean including the restrooms. Can't wait to try more here!"}
{"text":"This isn't my first time here. Apparently my review was deleted or removed or something a few years ago. I actually love tavern 6. We used to live less than a mile away on Hobart road and it was extremely convenient for us to eat and walk home.   We started with the fish tacos. Which is our norm. We haven't been back in about a year and I was a little bummed when they came out. Only because they were a bit small. I was used to them being over stuffed with the slaw and goodness coming out of them. Today, they were virtually empty. But, they were still very tasty.   I had the Cobb salad and it was awesome! The chicken was cooked and seasoned perfectly. I also ordered some chips because they're the best! Husband had the club. Which he inhaled and loved!  We did have a cupcake, it was chocolate with BlackBerry frosting. It was moist and delicious. Still a bit bummed about my first review. However, that'll never stop me from returning. See y'all soon!"}
{"text":"Bar staff is condescending and rude. Met a group of people here for a birthday celebration. Paid for many songs on their Touch Tunes. Current soft country songs. Staff turned the volume practically to mute. Asked 3 different staff members behind the bar to please turn volume back up. A lot of eye-rolling, no more music. There were 10 of us planning to eat dinner here tonight. Not going to happen! NEXT!!!"}
{"text":"After a slow start, we were finally able to get a table for eight have a nice dinner with great service."}
{"text":"I'm in Ohio for business and decided to try this place based on the yelp pictures. We ended up getting bad/no service because the employees only really payed attention to the regulars. Our food took 50 minutes and my chicken was too dry to eat. I was unable to send it back in a timely manner because nobody came and checked on us, or even really looked our way. Needless to say I just ate McDonalds..  Save yourself the misery and just go somewhere else."}
{"text":"This restaurant is surprisingly nice.   I had a quick dinner with some friends and enjoyed a drink and a beverage in the dining room. It was just past peak dinnertime so it was a little noisy, but not unbearable. Our server was nice and helped me select an entree that could be made vegan. My non-vegan friends ordered a veggie burger, a salmon dish, and some tacos and were all pleased. The crowd favorite was the huge order of homemade chips that came with one friend's meal.   I'd definitely go back to Tavern Six again - especially to check out what seems like a great patio!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great decor, great food, and great beer. Wings are the best in the area!"}
{"text":"We've been in Kirtland 23 years. About time we get a restaurant worthy of the name. Tavern Six sounds like bar, but not bar grub. Good selection of draft beers-many a dozen, and burgers, etc. Not a great wine selection, but not too high priced either.  But loaded sweet potato skins, great pizza Mahi or salmon and risotto. Things \"bars\" never have. Try it. You'll find something you will like."}
{"text":"Food was very, very good.  We will lead with that.  Sweet potato skins, pulled pork mac n cheese, and spicy chicken club were all outstanding.  Basically, if you're looking for good food and couldn't care less about service.. this is your place.      That being said.. the service was decent at best (and that's being generous).  We waited forever for our waitress to take our drink order and we were sitting at the bar.  Our food came and our food went... three different servers took care of us. We are normally the type of people who tip 30% but it was hard to leave a tip when we didn't know who our server was. If we hadn't been sitting in the bar it'd be a totally different story and review... but we were.. in a Friday night at 6.. so yeah.    You want some good food.. check it out.. you want amazing service.. find somewhere else."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour and left very happy.  Drink prices were excellent during happy hour and very fair when not marked down.  Had their wings which were very good with their homemade hot sauce, fries, and the best Mac n cheese I have ever had.  Definitely some down home cooking going on here.  I sat at the bar and the bar tender was very friendly and I checked out some of the food coming out of the kitchen and it all looked amazing.   I will definitely be back and can't wait for warmer months as their patio looks really nice."}
{"text":"Amazing food great service and holy crap amazing french fries go to this restaurant and buy their food and spend your money on their cupcakes are freaking amazing"}
{"text":"ALWAYS consistent and good.  They change up the menu seasonly, and selections are always fresh and tasty.  Large portions, yummy creations.  Probably the best hummus I have ever had.  LOVE the homemade pita chips!  The back patio is so NICE and big.  It's a great place to enjoy a few drinks in the summer, and very family friendly."}
{"text":"Came on a Lent Friday and waited between 15-20 minutes before the reorder of AYCE fish came. Unacceptable."}
{"text":"This is a short drive from my parents house and has become our go to spot while we are in town and their go to when they don't feel like cooking!    Nice, clean, hometown sports bar with better food.  We've tried a lot of things over the years but my brother's favorite is the mac and cheese, my dad always gravitates to the fish tacos and depending on the rest of our moods we go burgers, wings, or even some of their lighter entrees like the salads or salmon. Everything is good, service is always pleasant and efficient (Felicia is our fav!) and the pricing is good too. They even have cupcakes!  Although full disclosure, I'm always too stuffed to order one.    The decor pays homage to Kirtland and it's successes without being too kitschy or overdone. Definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this place!!  My family and I eat Friday night dinners here every other month or so.  We've had nothing but exceptional service and everyone is so friendly.  The tomato basil soup with the grilled cheese bites are the best!  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times. Every time the food is great and every time, without exception...the service is absolutely atrocious. By service, I don't necessarily mean the servers who do the best they can and are attentive and good but are always stretched too thin. People come in and wait at the never staffed host stand. The time it takes to get food is inexcusable. It took 45 minutes to get an order of hummus/guacamole. It took...well, I don't know how long bc we are still waiting but it's now been over an hour and twenty minutes. Hire. More. Staff. A table near us complained bc they were waiting over an hour on their check. It's a poorly run restaurant. I've been here at least 7 times and it doesn't change. The staff are just undermanned. I assume they have one oven and frying pan in the kitchen. When people complain and nothing is done, that's reflective on management. Food good but don't come hungry or you'll starve."}
{"text":"My buddy and I had an overall average dining experience here, but I was pleasantly surprised at how good the food was. Atmosphere was relaxed and the service (from two different servers) was fair, at best.  I had fish and chips and my buddy ordered a burger with fries, certainly not anything special or unique; we just wanted a place to have a decent bite to eat while we enjoyed some good conversation.  We waited nearly 40 minutes to get our food during the six o'clock hour in the middle of the week. The restaurant had lots of tables available inside, but we wanted to sit outside on the patio to take advantage of a gorgeous early spring evening.  The fish was plentiful and my buddy's burger was huge and juicy--it looked to be about half a pound beef and a patty that was about four or five inches in diameter. To get a refill was a chore. We waited almost another 20 minutes to get a second round. By 8:00 the place was full and we waited a long time to get our check.  Oh--there was one other thing: The parking lot. It was dark when we left and the lot is poorly lit. We were parked near the front in a spot that looked like it was an add-on, so our space looked like it didn't belong. It rained earlier in the day. When I opened up my car door, I managed to step off the asphalt and in to about six inches of standing water and mud. I was not happy.  Good food, nice atmosphere, less than average service."}
{"text":"Wow, Ryan TR the bus boy/bartender is absolutely wonderful. He greeted us and gave us wonderful service. He bussed our meals in a timely fashion. Excellent pizza's. I give this a 5 star."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Sunday afternoon for a little \"hair of the dog.\" Oh yeah...... This place rocks.  We'll definitely be back!   The inside is very cute. Beers and cocktails are served in mason jars! I forget the name of the drink I ordered, but I remember that it was made with Titos, local honey, grapefruit juice and fresh basil. I hope they have a patio because this will be the perfect summertime drink!    The menu has a lot of variety and prices are reasonable.  We ordered the cuban and one of the burgers. Both had great flavor and were served with delicious house made chips.   Our service was impeccable. I believe the owner even stopped by to see how everything was. Our waitress informed us that cupcakes are made from scratch every morning and today's flavor was Samoa. You know, the chocolate/coconut girl scout cookies....... Wowza. Best cupcake ever!"}
