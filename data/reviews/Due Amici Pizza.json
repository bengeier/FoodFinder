{"text":"Super delicious pizza. I like their caprese slice, it is one delicious slice. The crust is always crispy and thin the way good ny style slices should be. And the toppings are top notch quality and thick so biting into the slice is like eating a good steak. Thick and juicy. Their dinner items are good, I stick with the red sauce items like spaghetti and meatballs or chicken parm. Their red sauce is very balanced, between sweet and tangy and is not too thick and not too thin. These are very simple dishes and pizza is a simple food, but it is so hard to find a place that does it just right. And consistently. This is a very traditional pizza place down to the simple chairs and tables. The place is a good size and clean."}
{"text":"I've tried most of the local pizza shops in the University Area and this one is the best so far.  The pie is huge, whether you buy by the slice or better yet, get the 16\".  Great crust, not too thin and not too thick; crunch on the outside but a delectable chew inside. It holds up well too, when you pick a slice up.  The sauce (which I think is key) is very tasty, good quality.  I've never had it too greasy, y'know when you pick up a slice and practically all the toppings and cheese fall out?  ...hate it when that happens.  My favorite is the mushroom but I've had others too.  They are very generous with the toppings.  I really love the caprese pie but it's senseless to pay $22+ for a pizza.  Value for the large one topping is worth it for me and I'd rather pay $15+ for that than any \"special\" your pizza chains will offer for their so-called pizzas.

I've always had mine to-go, but inside is a typical pizza joint; not much ambience.   It's always been busy though, every time I've been there and that can be any time of the day.  That's a good sign.

Sometimes, I wish they delivered but fortunately for me, I live close by."}
{"text":"Sounds redundant, but hands down best NY pizza in Charlotte area. Like Little Italy in NE Charlotte. Wish they would open another in SE! I treat myself once a week to a couple slices for lunch. Try them!"}
{"text":"I grew up north and the pizza was amazing.  I have had pizza from Chicago and New York and I have to say the pizza at Due Amici is every bit as good.  There sausage roll is also great.  I have had several different meals and have never been disappointed. My wife says they have the best Greek salad she has ever had."}
{"text":"You want real pizza by the slice NY style the Due Amici is the only place in the area even worth a stop.   Was very happy when I found this place and try and eat there at least once a week.    It even comes with a bit of Northern attitude which some can take or leave but it always makes me laugh a bit.


Their cannolis are amazing too I definitely think you should get em when they put em out fresh.  

My only complaint is no delivery but it only takes me a few minutes to get there and home so no biggie."}
{"text":"The best pizza around. It is a great place to grab a slice of New York style pizza, or even better to get a whole pie. There isn't a bad thing on the menu. The service is good. Besides, they are always busy, so you know people keep coming back for more. Always the first choice for pizza."}
{"text":"Ah-maz-ing. Seriously. Me and my husband eat pizza at least once a week and this place is my favorite NY style place."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time yesterday, after seeing the reviews I thought this place was going to be epic. When actually it was just alright. 4 slices of pizza and 2 drinks cost right under $20 and they basically just reheat what they have sitting on the counter. Crust was crunchy and the cheese was super stringy so that was a good thing. Just not one of those places that I would actually crave or want to go to. Nice people, just overpriced. Fuel pizza is on the same level in my opinion, this is just more of a family owned atmosphere."}
{"text":"Missing NY style Italian food, must come to this place. Great italian food, nice staff, reasonable prices and the desserts are great too. Will be coming back for more. This place is a must for good italian food and desserts."}
{"text":"Pretty good NY style pizza. The Stromboli's on the other hand are definitely subpar and \"pre-made\" as I was told I couldn't add anything to them."}
{"text":"Good NY style pizza. The Greek salads are great as well."}
{"text":"Not much In way of atmosphere but prices are great and food is good! Nice to have a New York style by-the-slice pizza place just around the corner"}
{"text":"Oh my god!!! Due Amici makes the best pizza in Charlotte. Just had a large pie with pepperoni on half and sausage on half. The pizza has a savory sweet aroma that fills the car on the way home and the house once there. The meats are the highest quality. The sausage isn't that crumbled stuff. It is thinly sliced sweet Italian sausage. The cheese has the perfect amount of oil. The sauce perfectly compliments the incredible crust, cheese and meats. To finish, had cannoli. All I can say is OH MY GOD IT WAS A GREAT DINNER!"}
{"text":"Probably the best pizza in Charlotte.  The Due Amici guys are from New York and offer several kinds of pizza that you simply cannot find anywhere else in Charlotte.  My only hang up is that they brought the New York prices with them.  No pizza in this world should exceed $10 to $12.  In the Northern states you can find plenty of places that have pizza this good all under $12.  Yet prices at Due Amicis exceed $18 and up to $21 per pizza.  Worth it?  Maybe so if your used to paying these prices.  I am not.    Enjoy!"}
{"text":"When I first moved down here a few months ago I was looking for an authentic, non chain pizza place.  I called the first time to place a call in order, and from the moment I heard the owner's heavy Sicilian accent I was hooked.  Due Amici is much more than just amazing pizza.  All of their pasta dishes and sandwiches are amazing. The best part is their clearly homemade marinara sauce, it is top notch! I have brought several family members and friends there when they visit and everyone has loved it. This place is my first review for a reason, as there are not enough positive adjectives in the English language to describe my love of this restaurant."}
{"text":"BEST pizza! Love the atmosphere with employees yelling out orders, nothing fancy and that's what makes it great! A must try!"}
{"text":"Food: Always great.  Never had anything bad.
Recommended: Garlic rolls, Caprese, Italian Sausage.  
Service:  Brisk and brusque.  Don't let em \"forget\" the cheesecake on take-out orders.
Environment: They have tables but this seems more of a take-out place.  Clean enough.
Value:  A littler higher than average & worth it.

Bottom line: Not a fan of the NY attitude, but definitely a fan of the NY Style pizza."}
{"text":"Always well prepared, hot and tasty food. Service is quick and the staff is made up of almost all family members. The owner is very friendly and if there isn't a line, enjoys to chat.

My family's standard order is Chicken Marsala dinner (comes with side of spaghetti, salad & bread), lasagna & a veggie roll.

The price is on the high side but worth it in taste, atmosphere and support of a local independent business."}
{"text":"If you want real New York style pizza, this is the best you'll get in Charlotte! Love this place!"}
{"text":"I am from New York City and i thought i will never find the same taste in Charlotte.  If you live in new york city and want the same pizza taste in charlotte, this is the only place you can eat the ny style pizza, including sicilian pizza and zeppolis. Don't forget to try their house salad with house dressing.  I highly recommend this place!

My next mission is to find the best Chinese food in charlotte or closest taste we used to eat in ny, no luck yet!"}
{"text":"It was good but compared to davincis it is below it. The crust was a bit too hard for my liking but what made up for it was their pizza sauce. It was quite a treat I should say but nothing over the top."}
{"text":"I'm from New Jersey, which makes me an expert on what good pizza and Italian food tastes like, and Due Amici is the real thing. You won't find better pizza anywhere else around here, and their tiramisu is nectar of the gods. I eat there all the time, and don't plan to change that!! Go to Due Amici for seriously good food, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is a family-owned restaurant with great food and very friendly service. Great pizza with delicious crust. I prefer to go here for lunch and grab a couple slices and a drink. Easy to get in and out and for a small restaurant has a pretty large menu. Their pasta dishes and tiramisu are great! The only downside is the prices, if you are buying quite a few pizzas be prepared to pay."}
{"text":"They have the best pizza! They have a special, delicious flavor unlike anywhere else. The portions are big. Great salads and desserts too! It's a little pricey, but that's because it's so much better than other pizza places."}
{"text":"1st time in the restaurant  food was great. I had a stuff pizza it was awesome also had the garlic knots , zepplins? The italian doughnut it was different but good and then I had my first ever cannoli! The texture was smooth and the taste was to excellent!  I can understand why it can be a weakness.  The 4 star rating was on the service we waited a long time for our meal then the had to be reminded  to bring our dessert.  So wouldn't recommend  to go on the weekend if you was good food and services."}
{"text":"Garlic knots are great with sauce. Really affordable and great place for pizza lovers if you don't want to eat while big pizza."}
{"text":"Good food for a reasonable price. Pizza and rolls are good. I will try the pasta next time."}
{"text":"I wish I lived closer but whenever I am anywhere near the university area I make sure to go. Some of the best pizza I've ever had and I've had lots of pizza in ny and nj. My review is solely on pizza since that's all I've ever had"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza in CHARLOTTE by far. Fro. The North originally and this is as close as it gets."}
{"text":"Great pizza, very popular in the neighborhood.  Pizza by the slice, great dinners and desserts, very generous toppings.  

Pros:  Authentic pizza, great variety, tons of toppings, family friendly (not so important to me, but always lots of kids), lots of entrees, strombolis, etc, great desserts.  

Cons: No delivery, sometimes a little rude (which makes it feel more authentic, actually ;) )

If you're in the area, stop in and grab a slice."}
{"text":"Miss this place so much!  Moved to Columbia SC 3 years ago and CANNOT get decent pizza anywhere. We were in Charlotte yesterday and made a point of stopping by.   Had pizza there and took a stuffed pizza home.  Still GREAT.  Thanks guys and keep up the great pizza!"}
{"text":"Not friendly at all . Acted irritated when we asked about sizes and wouldn't even show us or tell us how many slices  were in a pizza. Bad customer service!!!"}
{"text":"Pizza was really good but the dining in presentation needs a lot of work.  The New York style was delicious.  Need something more then paper plates.  We cut right through them."}
{"text":"My husband and I love coming here! It is our favorite pizza joint! I love how their sausage is sliced just like pepperoni! So delish!"}
{"text":"Despite the high reviews, I found almost nothing special here. The pizza slices tasted like cardboard. No flavor and dry and hard. I would not waste calories on this in the future. 

The garlic knots, however, were actually good. Most garlic knots are little hard bricks of dough. These were soft and yeasty with a real garlic flavor. 

Even though it's super convenient, I will not return. There are better pizza places I'm this area. Try DaVinci's off of Davis Lake and Harris instead."}
{"text":"I'm from NJ so I know good NY style pizza!  If that's what you're after.. I highly recommend this place.  The spinach ricotta white pizza is really good!  The only negative might be that there was a little too much grease on the pepperoni slice but that can easily be blotted away.

GREAT crust and flavor!  Finally.. I can be free from chain pizza!"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza we've had since moving to Charlotte from NY. Very friendly and accomodating staff and consistantly good food."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza. Just like you would get in NY!! I continue to go here because the price is right and the food is amazing!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza...my 4th time there. We only order assorted slices, have yet to order a full pie. Also just tried the rice ball, very tasty. Another big  plus, they sell Manhattan Special espresso soda1!! Modern clean bathroom. I recommend it and I will definitely return.."}
{"text":"My wife and I love Due Amici. The pizza is always great and they have these Jamaican type beef patties that they can add Mozzarella...anyways...I'm getting hungry thinking of it. Great family owned place, great family as well. Definitely an asset to the community."}
{"text":"Amazing cheesecake!!!!!!  We tried a slice to go and it was heaven.  Very good texture and thickness.  Also very fresh.  The crust was amazing too!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, and everything else.... those jalopenos will kill ya the next day...."}
{"text":"I wanted to quickly update my review, because they totally deserve it. When I first moved here I wasn't too pleased with the chicken rolls, when it comes to pizzareas I'm a tough critic, moving here from NY I wasn't sure if I was going to enjoy pizza and rolls as much as I did there. But, now after consistently ordering from here Because my husband was obsessed with their wings I have to Admit I'm so happy this is our local pizza spot. Customer service continues to amaze me. The chicken rolls, beef patties, pizza, and garlic knots are Exquisite. Also the hours are wonderful, my husband sometimes comes home late from work and when we want to order out everything closes so early, but not Due Amici Pizza. So if your looking for a good local pizza spot this is your place, Enjoy!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for NYC style pizza, this is the only place to go.  They have pizza, pasta and subs.  They have Italian ice and zeppole.

Fold a slice of pepperoni, close your eyes and take a bite.  All that's missing is the sound of taxis flying by."}
{"text":"New Yorker here! We've gotten pizza here a few times now, each time purchasing the buffalo chicken pizza. The smaller size is a great price for the size. My only complaint would be that the pizza needs a little more buffalo sauce made with less butter, and it should also be less messy. They should also try using feta cheese too! 

Overall, it's definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"5 stars when compared to any other pizza joint in the area.  

Due Amici is the ONLY place in the Charlotte or LKN area I have ever had that resembles a pie like up where I am from (1hr outside of NYC). 

A lot of people try to tell you to go here and go there....tonys/da vinci's.....I ahve tried a few of these places and my conclusion is that southern people don't know what pizza is!  If you want a real pizza then this is your only choice!

Also, their garlic knots, tira misu, and pasta sauce is GREAT"}
{"text":"I am from Brooklyn and Pizza is an important part of life. You can get good to great pizza anywhere. I have my favs when I go home. But in Charlotte they are just slowly rounding the corner. Here it is Due Amici.  I am seriously saying they have some real good pizza. Near perfect. I have no complaints. I don't even get extra cheese cause it really doesn't need it. It's tucked in the corner of a Supermarket strip mall and I want it to stay there. They really need to be in midtown but please don't ever move. Perfect"}
{"text":"Went to Due Amici's the other day:  it's near my house and has such amazing reviews, so might as well give it a shot. Boy, it did not disappoint. My hubs and I went up to order their veggie pizza, and were quickly guided away from ordering one of the largest sizes. I very much appreciated the input from such amazingly friendly owners. We finally ordered the medium veggie pizza, and was very glad we did not order the large. The medium is enough to feed a small family! LARGE pizzas! 

I've never been to New York, and I have never been to Italy, but I imagine the pizza to taste like what you may get at Due Amici Pizza. Large slices, of fresh ingredients, with an unique marinara sauce. The pizza dough is cooked well, but still melts in your mouth. 

They have calzones, pasta, and many other options on the menu. With how amazing their pizza is, I'm sure everything else is fantastic. I can't wait to go back and try it again!"}
{"text":"I come here because their pizza reminds me of home, NJ. I've been here far more than my two check-ins. The pizza is always very good and the slices large. The people who work there could be nicer. If they are from NJ or NYC, I guess I should expect that, but here in NC, I've grown used to people being overly nice."}
{"text":"Very good, authentic NY style pizza. It's in a no frills location, so take it home to enjoy."}
{"text":"This business greatly pertains to those in search of a great Italian take-out.

Their food. Speaking from experience, they put together a mean specialty pie called \"Caprese\" which features a fresh mozzarella-based pie, fresh tomatoes, roasted red peppers, a good amount of garlic, basil, and EVOO. This is extremely delicious, and I recommend a trial. Their pasta entrees are also very good. A favorite of ours is the \"Penne Rosario\", which is served over a pesto cream sauce. 

The venue itself is better suited for more of a quick eat, with bench-like seating arrangements. Not much décor. Dine-in is better suited for a lunchtime demographic. The overall location is generally decent but I feel like their business would fair much better in a larger commercial facility with a true \"dine-in\".  

Lastly, the owners are Italian. Always a plus when running an Italian business. 

For more info on this business, and/ or access their menu online see http://www.dueamicipizza.com/."}
{"text":"Checked Yelp for  a new pizza place and found this place, pizza was very good . Love NY style . Best pizza I have had in a long time. Try the Garlic Knots as an appetizer."}
{"text":"Very good NY style Pizza and the Greek Salad with grilled chicken is excellent.  Customer service is just okay (minus one star)."}
{"text":"Visiting my parents from the weekend they said this was a must. I must say it was delicious. True NY style. The owner is italian too. We got pepperoni ham and chicken wich was so yummy. The atmosphere is casual and there is a TV, it was on sports center (march madness). My mom got the gluten free which is not something most pizzerias offer. Something for everyone! I would absolutely come here again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Being from New York, I have come to miss and yet appreciate New York style pizza anywhere and time I can find it.  So its no wonder, I love and appreciate the pizza Due pumps out on a daily basis.

*I like that you can order pizza by the slice.  They usually have 4-6 pre-made pizzas  from which they are selling slices from.  I like to run a pepperoni slice and maybe a pepperoni/pineapple or pepp/shroom slice.  Either way, they throw your slice in one of their gigantic pizza ovens for about 6-8min (it always feels like a long time).  After which, they will take your pizza to your table if you are eating there or box it up for you if you are taking it to go.  

*I love the crust.  It is not exactly what I would call thin crust.  Its just thinner than your typical chain pizza slice.  Its soft, yet sturdy enough to support whatever toppings you have on your slice.  Speaking of toppings, they always put a plethora of toppings on every slice - hey better too much than too little right? 

*Prices are a little on the high side in my opinion.  When compared to the prices for a slice at places like Tony's and Fuel, Due Amici's slice is about a $1 - $1.50 more expensive.  Their whole pizzas aren't cheap either.  The price is what's keeping me from giving Due 5-stars.    

*Staff is always friendly and polite.  No complaints there.  There is also plenty of parking in the plaza Due is located in.  

Overall, the pizza is excellent.  Whether you are getting just a slice or a whole pizza, Due Amici won't disappoint.  Though its not exactly Mariella's Pizza across from Central Park, its as close are you are gonna get to Big Apple style pizza in the Queen City."}
{"text":"My wife and I moved to Charlotte back in 2006 and were hoping to find a great pizza place nearby. When we found Due Amici, we jumped for joy as this is as good as the places we went to in NY. If you are from Brooklyn, you should know the names, L&B Spumoni Gardens in Gravesend, LaVilla in Mill Basin and DeFaros in Midwood. Three great places and I would put Due Amici up against any of them. This is our Friday night place. They also serve great dinners as well as all kinds of pizza. Great place, great people. Give it a try.

{"text":"We are new to the area and one of the criteria for my family and I is to have a pizza shop that we can frequent 4-5 times a week. We've tried a couple and you can review my others if you like. After strategically reading and plotting I came across Due Amici. I had reserved hopes based off my previous experience with a yelp recommend akin for a Chinese spot, but needless to say I loaded my kids up and started out pilgrimage to find our new pizza Mecca. 

So we roll into this older BiLo shopping center strip mall and find the pizza joint. As I'm unloading my girls I ask a couple of patrons exiting, how the pizza was. They all responded with greening reviews. So my mouth began to water in anticipation. 

As soon as we walk in we are greeted with a \"hello\" and we can see their display cases full of good eats. From calzones, sfogliatelle, stiffed pizza, slices and more. 

Our standard family test is cheese pizza slices. So we ordered up 6 slices and 1 pepperoni and sausage. 

Now NY pizza is an art and these guys have a good grasp on it. Their cheese to sauce ratio is near damn perfect. Enough sauce to cover but not runny. The cheese was enough to cover the sauce but not too much to gag. Sauce had a very nice oregano, basil, salt and rich tomato profile. The slices held up to the fold and hold test. As soon you fold and hold it up. The front point shouldn't collapse and man was this slice perfection. It was crisp on the bottom but not too much. Cheese slices were just great. 
Oh yeah, cheese slices are only $2.20.

The pepperoni and sausage slice I got met all the above criteria that the cheese slices set the benchmark at but I was turned off from the sausage flavor. Now kudos for these guys not putting a frozen crumbled sausage that the chains use.  What it looks to me is they slice up leftover rope sausage maybe. How the turn off was from the flavor. The first thing I could taste was an overwhelming flavor of old pork grease. Now some people may like this and maybe this flavor isn't in my wheelhouse so I didn't discount it off on my review because we had a great experience. 

We were so stoked after our meal I got my girls and I a slice of their homemade NY cheesecake to finish off this meal. Well let's just say that my 2 year old was doing foodgasm \"YUMMY\" at the too of her lungs and doing a happy dance with each bite. I had to fight my 10 year old for about 4 bites as she scarfed it down like she hadn't had a meal in weeks. From the four bites I had, I'd definitely go back just for a slice of this creamy rich dessert treat.

Review #2 two days later.  We go back to hopefully have a repeat. I called at 8:00 to ask about closing. They said they didn't close until 9:00 and to come on in. So we load up and make the 20 minute drive over. By the time I unload my girls and we enter the door it's 8:25. I made note of it because when we walked in 75% of the dining room was closed. So we go to order. I ask again, is it cool that we eat?  I was then told by the gentleman, \"that after 8:30 they only do take outs and the dining room is closed. We could order but have to eat at home\". Well I disappointed my girls and we left with no pizza. My gripe is this. He should've told me when I called at 8:00. I also confirmed via Yelp. No where when googling their name did I come across this 30 minute before we close crap. I haven't decided yet but we may not go back. It just rubbed me the wrong way after calling ahead, wrestling with two yungjns and driving 20 minutes only to have to figure out what I'm doing for dinner again."}
{"text":"Great pizza, many style and types to choose from. Greek salad with their own homemade dressing is delicious. My only complaint is the lettuce to topping ratio is way off, I would like more olives, onions, tomatoes, or cucumber.  But never the less, I get one every time.   Over all very good"}
{"text":"Simply the best pizza in Charlotte .. True NY style ... Crust and sauce are so good ... The flavor and seasoning of the ground beef topping is absolutely delicious ... Great service too ... Superb!"}
{"text":"Located in the parking lot by Bi-Lo. Staff is very welcoming. 
Pizza by the slice available with many choices. A few different beers on tap. Two televisions on either side of the restaurant. They weren't huge so I would necessarily recommend going here to watch a game. However soccer was on the tube while we were there which was nice."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for 11years and consistently has been one of the best pizza places in Charlotte. Having lived up north, i am a fan of mom-n-pop NY-NJ pizza joints, and am glad Due Amici is close to my house"}
{"text":"What a major disappointment ! The only authentic New York part of this place is the RUDE SERVICE THEY GIVE YOU ! 
We ordered garlic knots And it came out a piece of dry bread barely covered with garlic for and no dipping sauce and when we asked for dipping sauce we were told it was 50 cents extra !! WTF!!!! Thought it could not get worse then the pizza came! Wish we could have the pizza first that way we could have used The damn GREASE TO DIP THE GARLIC BREAD IN!!

THIS PLACE SUCKS!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm here right now and I'm so distraught by the way the owner (I guess?) basically told us to go by 8:30 cause tonight they're closing early. Then in a very rude way told us to only sit on the right side of the restaurant cause they're cleaning and closing. By the way there's probably another 10 people here right now so I'm not sure why he's so eager to kick us out. Don't care what the food tastes like, he was rude enough that I don't want to come back."}
{"text":"Great pizza, a little too expensive. People are saying that the attitude is expected from New Yorkers, I disagree. I lived in NJ all my life and spent a great deal of time in NYC. Attitude is not the norm, that's just for TV shows. Anyway, if you are in a service business, your attitude should be to service your customers not disdain. Again, pizza is the closest to home than any other we have tried. We recommend."}
{"text":"I LOVE this pizza. I'm totally addicted to the crust and the fact that I can get broccoli and garlic as my toppings."}
{"text":"Great NY pizza!!  Very casual atmosphere.  A little out of the way, but worth the effort."}
{"text":"I love coming her for lunch with my girlfriends. THIS is old school Italian pizza! Delicious home made, fast service, clean....Mua! Ciao!"}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp and saw that the reviews were good. Glad we tried it. The food was good and the service was great. Long line to place your order but it moved quickly. People working there all seemed to care about providing good service. We had slices, garlic knots,, and garlic cheese bread. All were delicious. Would definitely recommend this place. It's a little far out of the way for us but we'll find a reason to go back!"}
{"text":"Looking for good NY pizza  by the slice or pie?  This is the place to go.  You will love the pizza and/or other pizza shop favs like garlic knots and Italian ice.  This is by far my favorite pizza place in Charlotte."}
{"text":"One of my favorite local pizzerias in Charlotte. I highly recommend getting an order of Garlic Knots before your main entree, or adding a side Greek Salad. Both are a delicious addition to their amazing pizza!"}
{"text":"As close as you can get to real NY/LI pizza that I've found in NC. Not only is it the best pizza place I've found but I actually place them ahead of some LI pizza spots back home. I've gone dairy free recently and don't eat there as often but decided to get some gnocchi the other night and it was delicious. We've never had a bad item off the menu including eggplant and chicken rolls, and all types of slices. Jumping on Postmates was huge also because their only downside was no delivery. All is right in the world now."}
{"text":"Good pizza if you like New York style.  The guys working the counter are keepin' it real, no southern hospitality found at this establishment.  Decent prices and the pizzas are HUGE!"}
{"text":"If your hungry and you're anywhere within a 20 mile radius oh my goodness you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Their pizza is amazing. The staff is very friendly. The only reason I did not give them a 5 is because the crust on the calzones is very hard. I always get spinach in mine and I think they have them pre-made and add the spinach and reheat it?  I would skip the calzone and get another dish because their food is really good."}
{"text":"I was looking for Hawthorne's and wasn't sure if I had missed it or not, when I saw Due Amici.  I had read some good reviews so decided to give up my previous search and try this place out.  I got there right when the lunch specials were ending at 2:30, and they were nice enough to let me order from that menu.  I went with the baked penne.  It was ready in under 10 minutes, the serving was huge, and it included some nice warm bread all for $7.51!  

It wasn't the best baked penne (ziti) I have ever had, but it was tasty and cheesey and great to dip the crusty bread in.  I have enough left for another meal also.  It was super slow in there at that time.  The guys behind the counter were very friendly.  I will definitely be back to try some more, and I am sure I will be able to up them to 4 stars!"}
{"text":"When I first tried the pie a few years back it rated as one of the best in Charlotte.  The quality has since declined a bit.  It's above average for Charlotte, but not by much.  The attitude of the staff and owner is often not pleasant.  I have also tried one sandwich and one pasta.  I found both to be average.  This is a pizza place, and not a bad one, but just not one of the best."}
{"text":"Stopped here on a humbug to grab a slice of pizza today. Google reviews were praising this place for their NY Style pizza. When I arrived, there were about 8 people inside eating their meals ... the TV was on the Yankees game (of course), and there were 2 men (one older, other in his 20's) behind the register. The first thing you notice is that there's a large selection of pizza, calzones, stromboli, deserts and other Italian favorites. First of all, I'm from the NY area so I like to \"think\" I know my pizza pretty well. After my eyes feasted across the glass display for a few minutes, I ended up ordering one of the veggie slices (all slices are pre-made, like in the city). The young man grabbed a slice (with his bare hands) and threw it in the oven. 5 minutes later \"veggie slice up\" rings across the restaurant . So I take my super large slice .. . That was placed inside a brown paper bag, with a genuine \"paper\" plate. No napkins are offered, nor placed in bag, so I grab a couple from one of the dispensers on the table. The atmosphere is not too friendly ... But not rude either. You get a sense of a real authentic Italian restaurant while you're visiting. In all honesty, I have to say ... the slice was actually pretty good ... Really ! The crust was thin NY Style, the sauce wasn't too sweet and the ingredients were fresh. Only thing I would have liked would be that somebody have some dang gloves on !!! Really dude ... it's 2017  Put some gloves on it !! Anyway, the pizza was definitely worth the visit but I'll have to be in a \"New York\" state of mind next time I visit . Worth a look"}
{"text":"If you're looking for perfection, you just found it. Great service, mouth watering food, great prices, and a good place to just sit and eat. Not very fancy, but it's just right for a casual lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Went this evening for a slice a cheese and canoli. This is a place I use visit often so had to swing by. The staff greets you and is quick to take your order. They make the canoli fresh, to order. The pizzas and knots are made and they heat them up. 
It was very tasty and enjoyable. I love the cheese pizza. It was hot, cheesy, and good. The garlic knots were yummy. They were not and had a wonderful taste. The canoli is the best I have had period. Wish I could take it back to Ohio. This is some place that I would come back for. I enjoy the staff, environment, and food."}
{"text":"Good food, but dont believe the time they tell you when you call for take out... i waited an additional 15 min. Not good for buisness."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Charlotte, hands down! I like to get it burnt! 

I also love the rice ball! I make a trip here every time I am in town, just for the rice ball.  

Also try the meat patty and meat roll. Both are excellent!"}
{"text":"Top 3 pizza joints. Wish they had a lake location. Sucks having to drive to university area for a great pizza. These guys are never really happy to see you. They are from New York so it's to be expected. They do have some of the best pizza around."}
{"text":"delicious NY style pizza. The wings are great and my favorite are the garlic knots. My SO & I moved to NC from up north, Me NJ & him NY. It has been tough finding pizza worth eating until we found Due Amici. Great place!"}
{"text":"Lunch with my son a couple of slices best pizza in Charlotte.  We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"This is a great little spot. It's cafe-style pizza joint; when you go in, you order from the counter,  they bake your slice fresh, then call out when it's ready. They sell pizza by the slice, as well as whole pizzas, calzones, and so-on. I had the caprese pizza by the slice (fresh mozzarella, tomato slices,  and roasted red peppers on a crispy, tasty crust), and 3 garlic knots. ...TO DIE FOR! The ingredients were fresh and they used them generously. The slices are huge and the garlic knots were soooooo soft and buttery. My friends had Sicilian and sausage pepperoni pass - also remarkable. This pizza is off the chain."}
{"text":"Best food on the planet. This is the place I go to every other day when I do have money. It's a great place, with warm people who are accepting as well. 

The food is great. Everything from their pizza to Italian ice is absolute fire (amazing.) I usually eat their garlic knots, so I will say, best garlic knots you'll ever have."}
{"text":"I love this place! The plain cheese pizza is fantastic and so is their house salad dressing! I also love the chicken parm & buffalo chicken pizzas. My hubby and I are definitely regulars."}
{"text":"One of few places my spouse and I can agree on . We love the pizza. It tastes like real New York pizza. The garlic knots are SO good and always fresh. The service is friendly and fast. We visit here at least 2-3 times a month."}
{"text":"I'm a fan. Price is right and the pizza is really good. They sell by the slice too. If you moved to Charlotte from up North, this is what you probably were looking for. The dining area is spacious and clean. Friendly staff. I just wish they delivered. But nothing beats eating a slice of pizza right out of the oven."}
{"text":"Pizza is amazing! We always get the veggie pizza it's so heavy and filling and seriously delicious.  
The Greek salad is good too!"}
{"text":"I've been checking out some new dishes at Due Amici.  Tonight, my kids and I shared an order of chicken parmesan and an order of spaghetti and meatballs.  The parm comes with bread and a side salad, while the spaghetti does not.  HUGE portions.  As I mentioned, we shared these 2 dishes, and still came home with some leftovers.  I have also tried the penne with chicken and broccoli (which I ordered with a pink sauce, instead of the standard alfredo).  All were above decent.  Meatballs were definitely homemade, and not out of a bag from a giant foodservice company.  I thought that some could have used a touch more flavor, but overall, each was enjoyed a lot.  I do think that I prefer the pizza, but it is great to have the option of some of the pasta dishes as a change of pace."}
{"text":"I used to get pizza here because it's really close to my house, but I tried DaVinci's Pizza on a whim and I decided that if I'm paying that much money for a NY pizza, I might as well get one that tastes better and actually has a staff that is friendly and seems happy that you've chosen to spend your money with them. I've never encountered more unfriendly, rude, and generally unhappy to be helping you people than the employees and management at Due Amici. The pizza is okay but the staff is AWFUL."}
{"text":"My fiance loves this place because it's one of the few pizza places where you can top pizza with ricotta cheese. They have yummy greasy NY style pizza...let's be real, if people complain about grease they shouldn't  be eating pizza lol. I also love their wings, super crisp and drenched in the perfect amount of sauce. For 10 pieces of wings and a 16in pizza I paid around $30, a little pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"Due Amici Pizza, the real deal in a city that's got some pretty legit pies!  A total shot in the dark when I elected to stop in here on a recent Saturday for lunch.  Not easy to find using Yelp's directions, but once I did it made a bit more sense with obvious recent construction.
A pizzeria with a glass cabinet of pre-made pies, and another with pre-made rolls!  Seeing this had potentially good NY possibilities, we ordered a White w/spinach, a Chicken Parm, a Cheese Sicilian, and a Meat Roll!  The white w/spinach was good, but not as good as most NY white pies.  The chicken parm slice was incredibly good with lots of breaded, pounded out, chicken topping each slice!  The meat roll was absolutely slammed with sausage and pepperoni including some great cheese!  The marinara was a nice change from the sauce on the pies, and to dip your roll or pie into was simply fantastic!
These guys do a fantastic job, and you'd be doing yourself a huge favor if you are familiar with NY pies to give these guys a shot!"}
{"text":"This pizza is amazing! New York style in North Carolina. The owner is really cool, talked to us about where he gets his ingredients and his philosophy on his restaurant."}
{"text":"Best Pizza in Charlotte - real NY style as one of the other reviewers stated (Chloe S.). I usually get a couple slices and a coke - sometimes the Chicken Parm Pizza - (1 slice is very filling) - The sauce, crust and cheese are all excellent. Paulie's brother has a pizza place up in Concord - same good pizza there too if you cannot make it down to Prosperity Church Rd. I've tried other stuff on the menu - which is also good but the 'za rules! (hence the 5 stars)."}
{"text":"I loved this place. Deli-style service with huge slices of pizza and italian cake/desserts that looked good. It's a very casual atmosphere that feels like New York. The pizza was good, not the best I've ever had - I'm not an expert on NY pizza, so if you are from there, ignore my review. One small thing: I was a little intimidated ordering because it's chaotic behind the counter with a New Yorker-type of guy (impatiently?) waiting for me to decide, even when there is no one else behind me. Again, I'm not from New York, and they weren't unfriendly or anything, but I like a slightly easier, less stressful ordering system. If you aren't a wimp like me and want a cheap-ish neighborhood place with good pizza, this is your place."}
{"text":"Decent pizza! That buffalo chicken pizza was horrible :-( the fried chicken on it was soggy and had a horrible taste. The other slices we had were great!!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite to eat in between my appointments today. I had never noticed this place before until I drove by it. Checked my yelp reviews first before I went in. Reviews were fair to good so I decided to give it a try. I went in about 11:30 AM today and I was surprised that there weren't many available types of pizza to buy. I would think that around lunch time they would have many more pizzas out for you to buy. I was only looking to buy one slice but I was forced to buy two because they have a five dollar minimum charge if you use a debit card. That's a bit annoying. Because I only want one slice of pizza. The pizza itself was just OK. Wasn't anything spectacular. Like many other reviewers stated, the crust was kind of like cardboard. They have some other things that looked pretty tasty like calzones, salads and hoagies. I may or may not return. Unenthused."}
{"text":"Many of my neighbors rave about this joint. The only thing I can write is that is convenient to Highland Creek. I know pizza. I have been in NYC. I have eat at good pizza places. Trust me, just another notch from your local places."}
{"text":"I liked the options of slices. Chicken parm and Italian entrees were huge passing by us! We got a pizza & shared the huge Greek salad. We also got 3 garlic knots for 1.50 with the homemade amazing Marinara sauce. 
Call ahead if your doing take out - can be a bit of a wait. Prices were good! We took leftovers home. For a 14\" inch pizza with toppings/garlic knots/large Greek salad and 2 beers it was $38. with lunch for the next day!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for lunch today.  I had a slice of cheese and a slice of chicken parmensan pizza... which ended up being way too much food!

I know it's a pretty casual lunch/dinner place, but I got a little turned off by their storage situation.  They have open shelving and all there extra napkins and cups are stored for all to see...  great for utility purposes, not so great if there is a mess on the shelves.  Maybe it's just the OCD coming out of me, but I'd rather not see stuff like that at a restaruant - it takes away the \"magic.\"

Dining room ambiance aside, there are a ton of pizzas to choose from (by the slice) and they warm it up in the oven.  You could be eating from door to cash register in 5-10min.  Definitely will come back and have many many lunches here... since they do have other offerings other than pizza."}
{"text":"Picked up my order and returned home with a cheese pizza rather than the supreme pizza I ordered. When I called the response was, \"it's ok because we only charged you for a cheese.\" I asked \"so i have to pay the price for an error on taking the order\" and I received the response of \"yes, that's how I see it.\" Well, Tony's pizza is where I'll be going from now on, thank you for making that decision for me.

Quick tip, tell people at the counter to take out their apple headphones and they'll probably hear their customers better."}
{"text":"I had a fluke of bad pizza.  Subsequent trips have been much improved.

I dine in and the service is minimal but friendly and easy going.  I have been converted to being a huge fan of the chicken and eggplant Parmesan.

THIS IS NOT AUTHENTIC ITALIAN!  This is your NY/Chicago style Americanized Italian food.  That is what I am looking for when I go here and I get such huge portions it makes me happy!"}
{"text":"In a word: delicious! I ordered the \"fresh\" slice (mozzarella, fresh basil and tomato sauce) and the pepperoni and sausage. The ingredients were so fresh and tasty. Tons of real mozzarella cheese and fresh herbs. The sausage was really good; shaved, not crumbles. My husband ordered the chicken Parmesan pizza and pepperoni. Both were excellent. The crust is crispy and the pizza was firm, not saggy, like at some places if that makes sense! At lunch, they have so many options to try. Lastly, the restaurant and the bathrooms were clean. That is huge. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Sicilian from Brooklyn here...this is the truth! This pizza is very authentic and very very good!!!"}
{"text":"This place is the closest to NY pizza you can get.  Haven't tried any other food there.  I am not on that side of town often, but when I'm there, I go for pizza.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Their pizza is DELICOUS.  Authentic, New York-style pizza.  We also really like the baked penne and lasagna.  While it's a little out-of-the-way for some folks, I highly recommend taking the drive because you're going to love their food!"}
{"text":"I was visiting Charlotte from Durham and my wife was craving NY pizza, so we came here expecting \"amazing NY pizza\" and \"the best pizza in Charlotte\". We each ordered a plain slice, our litmus test for pizza, and shared a Greek salad and a chicken parm hero. The slices were underwhelming. The sauce is bland and the cheese tastes like it's stale or something. Maybe everyone is REALLY tired of Pizza Hut around here, maybe a lot of people come here totally blunted? I don't know, but if you're from Brooklyn... did you live there or move down here as an infant and never try real NY pizza? 
\"The best Greek salad\" was iceberg lettuce with a few slices of red onion, some tomato and cucumbers and dry crappy feta crumbles. The dressing was pretty good, but I assume when someone says something is the best, that they've tried other Greek salads?
The chicken parm: the cutlets were pretty good, but a single layer of thin cutlets on bread with bland sauce and crappy cheese made us both just eat the cutlets plain. They really should have more chicken on there.
Still wanting something that satisfied us, we ordered the Margherita slice, as the friendly kid at the counter had recommended it. It was solid. Far better than anything we had had, but still, nothing spectacular.
I gave up at this point, but my wife wanted SOMETHING that really tasted great and NY-y, so she tried the garlic knots. Her review: \"Don't bother trying it.\"
The staff was all very friendly, however when I heard the owner was from LI, I said hi and that we were from LI and he muttered something and walked away. 2 minutes later he very rudely ordered a staffer to fill all the pepper shakers in such a way that my wife was shocked and said she would have quit. She also told me to report the women's room was disgusting. Piss-soaked toilet paper graciously adorned the toilet seat and the garbage was overflowing. 
THE BEST!"}
{"text":"There is no shortage of \"New York Style\" pizza places in the Charlotte area - especially as you get up to the Northeast. Funny how that works. It's not like they put them on the South side of town. Almost like a mini-map of the country or something. Anyway.

Due Amici, while currently a bit challenging to get to because of (or due to) the 485 construction, is worth a slight drive out of your way. There are other places that are simpler to find, and some are even right off of the freeway. But take the time and find your way to Due Amici and you can find a number of slices that are well worth the effort.

Naturally they have things other than pizza, as any good joint will, but if it's right there in the name, should you really try anything else?"}
{"text":"I stopped by to pick my son up some slices to bring home. First time in this restaurant and I read good reviews. The man who waited on me didn't greet me or respond to my saying it's my first time ordering their pizza. Although my son enjoyed the slices, I was not impressed with lack of friendliness or customer service."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place because of the great reviews. 
For starters, their website is terrible! None of the links under the menu tab work, so we couldn't browse the menu at all. So we were forced to go in and order instead of ordering over the phone and picking up.
Honestly, we didn't see what all the hype was about. Not saying the pizza was bad, but it was nothing great to write home about.
We decided to get a bunch of slices so we get to try different varieties. We had the spinach ricotta, veggie, all meat, mushroom and pepperoni and some other that I don't remember. The spinach ricotta was terrible. The all meat one was okay. I liked the veggie and the pepperoni, but I didn't think it was anything great.
Also, the prices are rather steep, especially for how mediocre their pizza is.
And no, this isn't the best pizza in Charlotte, give me a break. Pure Pizza and Da Vinci's surpass this place in quality, taste and value for your money."}
{"text":"Love the pizza from here! It was my first time and the pizza was just like New York pizza or better! Will be coming soon to try different things."}
{"text":"Horrible experience and will definitely not be ordering from this place ever again. Placed our order online and tried making an adjustment soon after. Literally called the store soon after we placed the order to add jalapeños and was told that it was impossible to make the change, and that it was too late. We didn't mind paying for the changes but still \"too late\" since they had already received the order. Horrible customer service!!! Good luck to you all, but you guys need some work to do."}
{"text":"I'm from Brooklyn.  Love Due Amici.  Haven't been to a pizza place in NC that comes close.  These guys are straight about of Bensonhurst and are about their business.  I go in, they take my order, prepare it perfectly, BOOM...DONE.  None of that mindless small talk, just good food, good prices, a taste of home.  I don't mind the trip, it is well worth it.  I don't do franchise pizza.

Pizza is true NY style.  Thin crust, perfect sauce, just the right amount of cheese.  Fold it in half while it is scorching hot and you're in heaven.  They also have the best chicken parm, and meatball heroes.   Oh, and honest to God real Italian ices.  It's like I am back on the block again.

If you are looking for better pizza in Charlotte/Concord. fuhgettaboutit!  Due Amici's is the truth!"}
{"text":"THE best NY style pizza around. Pizza by the slice in a ton of varieties, everything from cheese to buffalo chicken, which is really delicious, by the way! I'd eat here every day if I could!"}
{"text":"Theres no better place for pizza in charlotte than due amichis. This is the closest pizza to back home! I am so lucky to only live a few mins away."}
{"text":"Pizza Slice Review Only!

My dad is from NYC.  He is a purist like many pizza afficianados.  There is only one type of real pizza and it is New York Style and it has one topping-Cheese.  You order anything else on it and not only is it not longer true NY Pizza you just insulted my father.  Good job.

Also true NY pizza places MUST sell by the slice ALL DAY!  If you don't you fall into the category of NOT NY Style pizza.  

The guys at Due seem to be following the rules of NYSP to the letter.  Very good slices.  Wanted to give 4 1/2 stars but they get a round up for having garlic powder on hand for the pizza.  

$2 a slice.  I did wish they had a slice special for lunch...2 slices cheese and drink for $5 or something like that.  BUT still a decent price for the food.  Slices are large.

PS...I will probably never know what anything else here tastes like.  It could be amazing or awful.  I don't care.  You eat pizza at a pizza place.
Capisce!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza joint in charlotte. I love this pizza the sicilian is my personal favorite and my wife loves the meatball parm. The guy is a straight up new yorker and don't expect him to go out of his way to be nice to you. Even regulars might get a how ya doin from him and thats all. But you don't go there for the service you go there for the food and its deli style set up is perfect i love that you can look and pick the exact slice you want. Cant go wrong here"}
{"text":"Great NY style pizza in NC. I'm critical of pizza that claims to be NY style. However, this is it. Authentic, delicious, right amount of sauce and cheese.  They have plenty of variety.  Calzones, Italian ices, parmigiana sandwiches, etc. The real deal. I can't wait to go back. Next time a pie to go..."}
{"text":"Top notch! The owner is from Long Island, New York, and definitely knows how to make great pizza. We're both from around the same area, and I can agree that he makes better pizza than many of the pizza places on Long Island! If you like New York Style Pizza, this is the place to go. I would go out of my way to go here!"}
{"text":"I tried ordering some pizza from here because it's nearby and has a high rating here on yelp. All I can say is wow. The caprese pizza is super fresh and delicious. The price is definitely justified. I will be coming back."}
{"text":"This is my go-to spot for pizza that tastes EXACTLY like home (NJ/NY). Never been disappointed. One day I'll come and try a pasta dinner, but the pizza is so good that I never give anything else a 2nd look. 
Only complaint (which really isn't a complaint) is they don't make Zeppoli's daily (because people don't buy them that often)....but I make sure I get them when they're here. 
Great place!!"}
{"text":"Just moved to Charlotte and heard good things about this place! Family loved it!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza but caprese salad do not get. I spent 10 dollars on it and the tomatoes were disgusting!"}
{"text":"Everything was great! The pizza, the cake, the service, everything was great! My sister and I ordered the Caprese pizza and we both loved it. The tomatoes were so juicy. The pizza has a little zing to it that made the whole pizza delicious. By the time I finished the firsts one I wanted another one. I also ordered a tiramisu and it was good. It wasn't the best I have had but it was pretty good. The price was reasonable. Service was also great! Would definitely come back"}
{"text":"I went around 7:15 on a Saturday evening and they were extremely busy. So busy that it took about 35 minutes for us to get our order when we dined in. Luckily we ordered an appetizer to hold us over but we weren't expecting such a long wait. The staff seemed a little unbothered and weren't as friendly as I expected but maybe that's the NYC authenticity. Asking for a to go box seemed to be a big task for them.  (Hence the 3/5 stars). 

Food: Definitely order the garlic knots because they were heavenly. The pizza was really good--my favorite was the crust it had the perfect crunch.  The slices are huge so be prepared to take leftovers. I didn't order the donuts because we were full but they looked really good so definitely going to try that next time! 

All in all I would order the pizza again but I would probably call ahead and eat at home."}
{"text":"I only came in here to get a quick pick up slice at lunchtime for my friend for her birthday.  Some other employees have reported how good their pizza is and I have tasted their tiramisu, which was excellent.  The store is very clean and organized. The employees are welcoming and friendly.  They have many lunch specials with great prices to choose from, so I look forward to coming back soon to try some of them."}
{"text":"Small and authentic New York Pizza, subs, pasta and pastry. My favorite is the capresse pizza. They are good folks and know how to do Italian!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here for years and order catering for birthday parties and other special events.  Best pizza and Italian dishes you can find and super nice owners!"}
{"text":"Today was my first visit to Due Amici Pizza. My wife said she wanted pizza for dinner and after a quick yelp search, I saw that this location was the closest to me with the highest rating. 

The location was very clean and well kept. They had a lot of different dishes other than pizza to choose from. The staff greeted me warmly and was patient with me as I decided the type of pizza I wanted. After placing my order, I waited about 15 minutes or so and I was all set.

That pizza smelled amazing while driving home. I just knew my wife would love it! After getting home, I tried my first slice and it was delicious. My wife tried hers and she was not as impressed as I was. But let me be clear, it was not the restaurants fault! It had more to do with my toppings and the type of cheese. So I take the blame on this one. 

As I said, I liked it a lot and I'll be back when I am in the area. This time, I'll be more mindful about my choices and hopefully I'll find that perfect combination that'll win the wife over."}
{"text":"Great pizza!  Always great, always warm.  Gold garlic knots too.  Authentic family and great chefs."}
{"text":"Amazing REAL italian food! Very attentive, polite, caring staff. I havent had italian food this good since i left CT.My new favorite italian place!"}
{"text":"I've had pizza from coast to coast, and never had anything better! The meat roll, meatballs, hell, even the fries were fantastic! We also had dessert. Best cannoli outside Boston!"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza I have had in the ten years I've lived in Charlotte. I eat here almost once a week. The staff is always welcoming and the food is awesome."}
{"text":"The best real New York taste and style pizza I've found so far it's soooooo GOOD!! I'm from Nwe York so I know My pizza"}
{"text":"We have tried many places that serve NY style pizza, and this is the best we have had!  Their calamari is also surprisingly really good!  Would love it they served calamari pizza!"}
{"text":"Really good NY style pizza! The slices are huge, the toppings are delish, & the crust is just right. Pizza by the slice is always a great option. The garlic knots & desserts looked so good...I plan to try them. And the service was great! Definitely just found a new \"go to\" in the area."}
{"text":"OMG I am hooked on their greek salad!!!!!   I crave it, at least, weekly.  The dressing is so delish!  YUM!"}
{"text":"Pizza is awesome here! Wish they would deliver. They would make so much money. If you want real New York style pizza, this is the place. It beats Hawthornes Pizza."}
{"text":"This IS,,,,,,, the best food in Charlotte. I love this place.  I'm starting to venture out from my normal pizza and tried the meatball sub today. it was great.  now I'm a big guy and can eat but this thing was HUGE, I could only finish half of it. Great Pizza, Great Pasta, Great sandwiches and best of all, this place has a little character.  A great change from the typical fast food, chain, ding ding (Microwave) restaurant that seem to be everywhere in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town!  We ordered an appetizer, a pizza, salad and a chicken parm and it was OUT OF THIS WORLD!  We will be regulars now!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm in NC for business and after reading reviews on Yelp & Trip Advisor, I decided I wanted to try it. It was about a 15 minute drive to get there but I had called ahead and placed my order. It was ready when I arrived and correct. I couldn't wait to get back and try it! I got lost both on the way there and on the way back but I would get lost and go through rush-hour traffic again for this pie! I kept it simple for my first time and just ordered cheese and it was just as delicious as I had imagined it would be....big, floppy, cheesy pieces that are perfectly seasoned and sauced and foldable! I will surely miss this pizza once I leave but am so satisfied with deciding to try it! Definitely recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing Italian American food. The eggplant parm was super yummy. A little disappointed with the spinach pizza we ordered as I think it was frozen not fresh spinach. This is our go to pizza and Italian place!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza spot tied with Davincis. Long Island guys that know how to make good NY pizza. The difference is their dinners are also bomb.com. I'll get chicken or eggplant parm if I don't feel like cooking but wanna binge on carbs and it's always great. Nothing beets a slice of cheese pizza. But their caprese slice is also good too."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Charlotte imo. I've never had a negative experience or even a neutral experience at Due Amici. It has always been overwhelmingly positive. The pizza is amazing. The garlic knots are great. The wings are some of the best I've had (and it's not even their specialty). 5 stars all day."}
{"text":"Awesome place! The food is beyond Awesome! When my wife merely samples the meat roll I ordered and says, \" honey we will definitely come back here \"! The wings were sauced perfectly and had a crispy exterior but tender inside. Yes,  we will be back!"}
