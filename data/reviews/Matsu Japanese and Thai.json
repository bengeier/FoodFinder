{"text":"I stayed across the street at the Westin and this place looked liked a decent choice for dinner Settings : nice, like a luxurious living room Food: just decent (I only had sushis and makis in the ayce). Also note that the rolls were coming out in 4 pieces, rather small, instead of 6 or 8 p in some restaurants Service: not good. Waiter could not understand what I was saying (English nor French), luckily, I only had to cross my choices. Food was super slow to come out. No pro activity, like bringing some water. Was served someone else's order at a time. Price: very good"}
{"text":"I've been to Matsu few times since they started AYCE service in their restaurant since it's near my home. Their sushi and rolls from AYCE are neither wonderful nor terrible (although they lay too much rice bed under the sashimi for sushi). Their appetizers, woks, and noodles are pretty much tastes similar to Chinese Take-outs from food courts.   I would recommend Matsu when you are really hungry and craving for some rolls and sushi. Also, when they take AYCE orders, they miss one or two dishes from the orders, or hand out the dish to other tables.   However, I'm giving three stars because of their excellent service and manners from the manager and the rest of the service crew. Even when I frown and ask angrily for my missing orders, they smile and politely respond that they will re-submit the order. They also try to be available for your needs. And this may be only reason I return to Matsu.   Their price is also very decent. Until March 31st 2012, they have a promotion price for weekend AYCE - $14.99 for lunch."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE SERVICE!!!! i went there on mother's day, and i had the worst dinner there! their servers were full of attitude and the food came out so slow The worst part: the food was under average! I will never go there again."}
{"text":"This place sucks.  The wait staff are all clueless, you wait forever for your food, and the food was average or below average.  They forgot to serve our miso soup, and when we received it, it hardly had any miso paste in it and it looked basically like water with tofu in it.  The beef curry rice contained scrambled eggs in it.  It looked disgusting -who puts scrambled eggs in curry?  And it was not stated on the menu that the curry would have eggs in it.  Again, the wait staff were all clueless -most of them were in training, had no idea what was on the menu or what they were supposed to be serving.  This was my second time here.  The first time I remember my soup tasted weird and the food was just not tasty.  I figured since they had just opened, that would explain why things were not quite right.  It has been about a year, and things are about the same, if not worse.  Would not go back there again."}
{"text":"I work in the area and decided to try Matsu Sushi one day.  We normally go to Momiji Sushi down the street, where you can get a Bento Lunch Box for about $12 or so.  I was intrigued by the fact that lunch at Matsu is $12.99 for all you can eat, so it seemed like a good value and we gave it a try.  The decor is all highend, with 20 foot clear in the dining room and crown moulding on the ceiling, very nice and fancy with vases, Buddhas and other decoration.  Almost makes you think this is a money laundering operation, because they surely put over a million bucks in this place!  Matsu is #1 in my book for cleanliness and appearance, it's a very topshelf joint.  The food is excellent for the value.  The Salmon/Mango Sushi Pizza (Chef's Special) is probably the best thing I've ever eaten in my life.  I salivate just thinking about it... in fact, I think we're going to Matsu today at lunch... mmm...  The philadelphia rolls are great too, and we've tried just about everything on the menu at this point, and for $12.99 there is no complaining.  We come back at least once a week, so that must be a positive sign.  I should probably get my mercury levels checked...  The only bad comment I'd have is it seems to be hit or miss on quality depending what day you come (who the chef is, quality of fish, etc).  Some days we come and the Sushi Pizza rice patty is prepared correct, warmed to perfection and topped with mango, salmon and sauce and all the right garnishes.  Another day we come, and the Sushi pizza rice patty is served ice cold, and I get a slight shiver of disappointment.  One day I come and the Philadelphia rolls are amazing, with fresh salmon and mmm mmm mmm goodness.  The next I thought I had beef in my philadelphia rolls, but then I realized it was Salmon and the chef failed to remove some sections of the fish that are tougher and darker.   All in all, I give this place a solid 4/5.  For $12.99, I don't know how they stay in business for all you can eat at Lunch... I almost feel bad eating there so much, I'm going to lead them to bankruptcy!  At the end of the day, you can always nitpick, and find something wrong with just about every place.  There's good days, there's bad days, but the good ones seem to outweigh the bad!"}
{"text":"I went here today - Friday July 7th, 2012 at lunch time.  It wasn't very busy. When I first walked in, I loved the quietness. It was very spacious and had pretty decor. Chandaliers, mirrors, black carpet, decently comfy chairs. The ambiance was nice.  The lunch price was $12.99. With tax it came to around $15, which was cheap for AYCE.  The satay pad thai was nothing special, had the general taste to it.  The sushi was okay. There was a decently wide selection, even for a weekday. I had the red dragon roll, a mango and salmon handroll (which was actually tasty despite the weird combination) and a couple of plain salmon sushi. I enjoyed the salmon, the red dragon roll seemed slightly dry to me. The salmon sushi was fresh.  I only had one of the dimdums, which was the BBQ pork. It tasted normal, the meat inside wasn't dark brown and gross, it was good.  Then I had two of the chicken dishes - spicy chicken and mango chicken. They tasted SO similar except for the sauce and the other ingredients in them. So they just use the same chicken with different sauce.   The thing that ruined our lunch was the curry. It tasted really gross and nearly made my companion throw up - yes, it was that bad. Don't try the curry!  For dessert, we had the fried banana and also the free green tea/mango/strawberry/vanilla ice cream. Same old flavours, nothing special.  Most of the food was similar to fast food. I would have to say the sushi was better than my expectations. I would say, for the price it was definitely worth it. It would have been a 4-star review if it wasn't for the curry.  It was nice that the waiters were quick, patient with us, and let us stay around to talk for a long time. It was a good experience."}
{"text":"I went here on a Saturday afternoon for AYCE for a birthday party of 20. The restaurant was 60% at capacity.  Not the greatest AYCE! The food did not have flavor. Lack spices in curry. Sushi was okay, but minimum  presentation.  Decor was modern and clean.  The service was slow and staff was unorganized. I lost my appetite because food came out slow. We placed multiple orders for items that did not come out."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Wednesday afternoon. They jacked up the price because it was the holidays, even though Dec 28th isnt really a holiday for many... so lunch was $15, but for a few dollars does a Yelper not deter.... (I'll admit, I tried to haggle the price down since the manager was Chinese and I was in an obnoxious mood, but to no avail).  Anyways, the food was... surprisingly good. The sushi and all the japanese food was average to below average (except for the Uni Pizza, which was pretty good- I usually despise Japanese \"pizzas\"... \")... teriyaki chicken was dry and the sauce couldn't save it, sushi was average for an AYCE, rolls were average, but the Thai food was actually pretty good.   The curries was of the creamier variety, and served roti bread and fried fish (if you ordered the... fish). Thumb up.   The satay beef was really good. ThumbS up.   At this point, sadly, I had already gorged on average sushi and maki rolls, so I couldn't try any more of the thai food. But I'll be back to give it another try.   Dinner has a few more options. Notable MIA items from lunch were soft shell crab rolls and sashimi (which is the norm).  I'm hoping for dinner they have some coconut shrimp or some other Thai options.   Comparable to Spoon & Fork from what I can tell. Though I'll need to try dinner to make a fair comparison.   I'm only giving 3 stars because the *overall* quality is average, a few good items, a few bad. Plus I couldn't haggle the manager, so thumbs down there ;)"}
{"text":"Domo arigato mister Roboto  Thank you very much, Mr. Roboto Until the day (we) meet again Thank you very much, Mr. Roboto I want to know your secret  Japanese Thai?!?!  Not sure that's the best way to market themselves. They should really go with \"Pan Asian\" which is the category I've coined for that of Salad King, Mr. Thai, and Spring Rolls.  Every Chinese person who opens up one of these restaurants thinks they can cut fish and make pad thai, so why not do both since they make so much money?  Now having said that, I'm a fan of affordable Pan Asian food, just like I'm a fan of HK Café and Chinese people's take on European western food (some kind of red or white sauce on pasta = western food), it's the equivalent of Man Chu Wok and the Mandarin I guess, but then again, that's Chinese people's take on what they think Westerners like for Chinese food.  It's all quite confusing.  Anyways, Matsu is located in the same plaza as Wonder Pho and the Piazzaolo, and on the same block as the new Galleria.  Recently opened, it still smells like a brand new place.  So far, I'm a huge fan of the décor and lovely design.  Dark woods, variety of seating styles from tables to booths to even a glass encased room for one large table.    The food is what you'd expect.  The \"Thai\" food essentially is some kind of saucy food on rice or vermicelli.  Today I got the mango chicken, which was fairly on point.  The Lunch special comes with a spring roll and a Tom Yum soup which was a bit sour for my taste for $10.  My buddy for a Salmon Bento box, and it looked fairly decent, but if nothing to unremarkable.  Service was decent, again nothing of note.  All in all, I'm happy this neck of the woods finally has a pan-asian place, and it's a bonus it looks very nice on the inside.  So.. Thank you very much-o, Mr. Roboto.   Kilroy."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. Once when they opened about 1.5 years ago and about 4-5 months ago.  When they first opened, they were a-la-carte.  My girlfriend's food looked absolutely amazing and tasted good (the few bites I had).  My food? I constantly had to remind them and then after almost 1.5 hours of waiting, I said forget it.  Since they were just opening, I thought they would have improved the next time....boy was I wrong.   They were now AYCE, but it took over 1 hour to get our entrees and we had to constantly ask them.  At the 45 minute mark, they said \"we have a computer problem\".  Still, the food was good, but not worth the wait.   If they could serve food within 15-20 minutes like most normal restaurants, I would give them 4 stars, but the horrendous service downgrades it to two."}
{"text":"Line up = 1.5 hours First round of food =  15 minutes Second round of food = 20 min Third round = got up and left to Tim Horton's because we were overly hungry   Bill paid = $60 for nothing.  If I could, I would rate it negative stars.. not even 1."}
{"text":"This is now my favorite AYCE for sushi. They have a few rules such as no more than 3 orders of any one items....but they have a plethora of items. They feature more sashimi choices than any other restaurant so the '3 dish rule' works out well.   This place labels itself Japanese and Thai....but its missing some key Thai items....those great salad rolls for example.  Their sushi is also excellent the presentation very good and unlike other AYCE sushi joint they bring everything you order. The only thing they failed to bring out was the salmon roe sashimi and they omitted to point out that they were out of it. I had to ask 3 times until someone spoke up.  Its certainly on a par if not a nudge ahead of my Sushi place of record: Maison du Japon.  Go enjoy go again."}
{"text":"So, first of all, the lunch price is insane (in the really awesome way)... $12.99 for everything you want off of this menu: http://www.matsucuisine.com/menu.html.  They basically put an a la carte menu CHECKLIST at each table with a pencil and you check off everything you want. There is a large selection (especially for the price) of options in the following categories: appetizers, soup, dim sum, wok dishes, stir fries & noodles, curry and wraps, sushi, maki, \"Chef's Special\" (salmon pizza, salmon & mango pizza, and unagi & avocado pizza), hand rolls and dessert.  Second of all, if you have to do buffet, this is the civilized way to do it. Waiter service. Love it.  YOU try to restrain yourself. It's not easy.  What we ordered the first time I went with an overall thought or two for each:  Green tea - very nice. Only matched by the green tea at the Caesar Spa in the Days Hotel at Yonge & Carlton. Spring rolls - YUM!!! Yam tempura maki - a couple were slightly soggy, but A-OK. Avocado maki - avocado was a bit too far gone - too squishy. Inari sushi - Yummers, though rice could have been stickier. Edamame - unsalted and microwaved-tasting. Gross.  Beef enoki rolls - OK.  Where they lost the stars:  SERVICE - very friendly and energetic, unfortunately to a fault. Upon being seated, four different servers approached us and took our drink order. I was polite to the first one but COME ON. Three and four got a bit of my lip. Deservedly. - the above experience was repeated each time I have visited (three times now). - that said, I loved the enthusiasm and cheerfulness. You don't see that much. It was a refreshing break in the middle of the day. - the hot & sour and miso soups we ordered were served last... what?  - the above soup experience only happened the first time.  KITCHEN - edamame was unsalted the first time, oversalted the second, unsalted the third... - Miso soup is pretty flavourless. - something is happening with the sushi rice. Are you making it ahead of time, perhaps? A bit too firm and not sticky enough... like trying to use long-grain rice for sushi. It's not good.  DRINKS - awesome. - mid-day cocktails rule.  So, it's not great, but it's fine for what it is - better than a lot of downtown hole-in-the-wall sushi joints!   Final note: Decor, serving ware and bathrooms all get A+ grades!"}
{"text":"I want to give it 3 1/2 stars..but it won't let me...so i rounded up.  Surprisingly it is really nice inside - clean, modern touches..nothing cheesy..much more fancier than I would have thought for my hood :)   I went on Friday for the AYCE dinner ($25).  IMO that is a bit pricey...$20 would be ok.  The food portions are small..i guess this allows you to try a variety of dishes..which is good...but if you get 1 dish it;s kinda impossible to share if you want more than 2 bites!  Tried some spicy salmon (not bad), giner fried beef (was ok), basil chickn rice (yum), and a few other dishes.  I did try the mixed tempura and basically you get 1 shrimp and 2 pieces of veggies.  Everyone was really nice and polite - they explained how the menu worked and what certain dishes were.  I did not find the items spicy (even though they were indicated as such).  I might come back for the lunch (since its cheaper - I am assuming the menu is the same)."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness! Talk about a great AYCE sushi restaurant.  Everything that comes to the table is presented wonderfully.  They even plated the squid and scallop as an amuse bouche.  As well, the soft shell crab was cooked to perfection.  I have to admit that I had to order the crab three more times. The decor is stunning.  The staff is very knowledgeable.  Leo, one of the waiters offered great suggestions, especially the 'black pearl' maki roll.  You have to try it.   This place is owned by the same people as Ginza sushi on finch and on clark in Thornhill.  They clearly know what they are doing."}
{"text":"This is a Chinese run AYCE sushi place.  They are not Japanese or Thai people.  When you order 2 dishes they only give you 1 and you sit there waiting for the food that will never come.  The decor is nice but the food is awful. When you order the sushi the pieces are 1/8 of the size that you get in any sushi restaurant.  That's fine since it is an AYCE but they make you wait at least 1/2 before they would get you the next plate.  We went on a Saturday at 6:30pm.  It cost $25/pp. The place is not full.  I think they do a delay tactic so that you get fed up and leave because all of our food did not arrive and we left there at 8:30.  I got diarrhea right after eating at this place.  I will never go back.  Save your stomach.  Stay away!"}
{"text":"I discovered my new favourite restaurant last night, and I wanted to share the joy.  It's called Matsu. It's billed as a Japanese and Thai restaurant. Two of my very favourite types of food! They have an \"All You Can Taste\" special, which is $25 on the weekends and $20 Mon- Thurs. So not cheap, but lunch is cheaper.   Oh.My.God.  I have recently become obsessed with sushi (Maki rolls, specifically) and the sushi was awesome! Funnily enough, I had one of the worst sushi meals of my life on Wednesday when I went to a Bento and Sushi on Dundas at lunch, and then the best sushi of my life last night at Matsu. The Magic Mango maki roll was pure heaven. The \"Thai Style General Tao's Chicken\" was to die for.   The place is located on the south side of York Mills, about a block west of Don Mills. It doesn't look like much from the outside (it's in the middle of a strip plaza), but the decor inside is gorgeous.   If you like Japanese and Thai food, I would suggest you run to Matsu. Well, maybe drive, because you will barely be able to walk when you leave.  :tongue:"}
{"text":"It's an interesting mix: Japanese and Thai... But I really didn't enjoy my food at Matsu.  I may have been spoiled with the good food that I've had at AME and at other Japanese restaurants, but this place just wasn't up to my standards.  We ordered the tuna tartar, and I wasn't very happy with the presentation.  Just looked ilke a haphazard in a cup.  It was okay - but not worh the amount that we had paid for.  I had the black miso cod bento box.  It came with maki rolls, sushi, two fried dumpligns, the black cod, rice, etc.  The sushi was good, but I didn't like how there were the dumplings (just seemed to generic and lazy) and the black cod wasn't good at all.  I ended up having a rash after eating it.  I'm sure the sushi is great at Matsu, but for now, I'm not very impressed."}
{"text":"The service is great, I usually do not get the all you can eat menu. TIP: Ask for the regular menu its way cheaper that way and you get just what you need! the service is kind of funny, you will have about 4 different people serve you, they all come and ask you if you want water one after another. They are so sweet though. THeir green tea is to DIE for! Crispy beef is great!!"}
{"text":"Okay let me say the nice things first: Restaurant is nice and clean, menu selection is decent. They don't have some items that I really love at Japanese AYCE places such as salmon belly, and steamed egg but they have most of the items you would expect. Now onto the not so nice stuff: The taste of the food itself is mediocre. Some items to note: sashimi was fresh,  black pepper beef was a delicious surprise, rolls were below average, pineapple fried rice and pad thai was tasteless and a waste of belly space.  Our party tried a lot of other items too but nothing really stood out. The service was good at first but then they disappeared for a long time and never brought some of our items. I don't know what to say. It looks like the negatives outweigh the positives for this restaurant.  $20.99 on weekdays and $25.99 on weekend."}
{"text":"Tried Matsu for dinner last Friday. We ordered a couple of appetizers (deep-fried oysters and tuna tartare), one  signature maki (Atlantic), and 30-piece assorted sashimi. The quality of the sashimi was adequate, and they did offer uni and toro, but we did not try them. The oysters were delicious, without the sauce, the maki roll was really good too. It had a scallop on top of every piece. The ambiance is modern and not traditional at all (no earthenware), so it was strange drinking tea from a coffee cup. The service was good, they refilled our tea regularly, but it was not very busy. The pricing, not so good. Too pricey for the quality of food, and they charge you for tea!! Perhaps we are paying for the locale. I still would rather go to Gonoe which is just down the road."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place so much.  The decor is nice and the restaurant is clean - everything is pretty new.  The food is actually, chinese, japanese and thai.  There is a lot of choice from what you want to pick since it is a sit down all you can order and eat meal.  To be honest, the food isn't the greatest at all.  They oversauce a lot of items with high sodium sauces.  For example, the teriyaki chicken is dry, but it has a lot of sauce to cover up the taste.  Unfortunately, the best part of my meal was the mango ice cream and the green tea ice cream.   I think the owners hired their own personal friends in need of a job and not for experienced or skilled waitstaff help.  Unfortunately, of the two times that I have gone there, both times the wait staff have trouble communicating with their customers since they don't have very strong english skills at all.    Most recently when I went, we had to remind them three times to clear our plates (which add up in a table with the all you can eat dishes keep on coming).  They forgot to bring us water and clean utensils when we asked them.    In our most recent dinner there, I witnessed an incident where this one waitress acted really unprofessionally have an emotional fit and was yelling to her waitstaff colleague in mandarin complaining about a group customers and their order.  She had the outburst in front of a table of customers since she was frustrated by trying to place an order that they wanted.  It was clear the breakdown in communication is a big part of the waitstaff problem, but it was really unprofessional of her to have an emotional outburst in front of the paying clientele like that.  For four people, (no drinks ordered) and including tip it was a bit over $100.  Honestly, with the poor service and the not so great food, please save your money and go elsewhere.  It wasn't worth it to go to Matsu for dinner at all.  The night after that we went to Richtree markets, not far away from Matsu, for a birthday event for the same amount of people.  We had a great time, got treated really well and we paid $75, including tip for the dinner."}
{"text":"I came here last Friday for lunch and I wish the experience was better.   The food here was meh. Salmon sushi wasn't fresh and the tamago was ice cold. The maki was good, rolls were alright. Cooked food wasn't all that great. The \"satay\" isn't grilled - its steamed and has some satay sauce on top. The dumplings were odd for me. It has shitake mushrooms, wasn't fried or pan fried - was steamed. The sauce wasn't served separately, it was this pinkish vinegar poured on top. Although no one should be eating dim sum at a japanese all-you-can-eat, but it was offered on the menu and it wasn't all that great.   80% of our foods came, we would occasionally get doubles of something we didn't order. Service was o-k.   One thing I really disliked about this place is they charge you $2.00 per person for hot green tea. It wasn't something they asked if you want, they just put it on the table and they charge you $2.00 per person.  All in all, I wouldn't be returning to this place because this is probably one of the worst a-y-c-e places I've tried."}
{"text":"My fiance's family and I came here for Christmas eve dinner!   We stuck to ordering mostly the Japanese stuff. My fiance loved the udon and had a good 5-6 bowls himself. He also loved their special rolls (Matsu roll?) and downed 2 alone. I loved their seared white tuna fish sashimi and stayed away from most of the rolls. I didn't want to overstuff myself with sushi rice! They also had dim sum .. like warm egg custard buns (my fav) and shiu mai. For desserts, unlimited green tea and red bean ice cream for the win! Our party of 12 had at least 30 scoops all together. It didn't take them too long to bring out the food and very accommodating to us continuously adding to our order.   Probably not worth it for its price especially since I filled myself with mostly ice cream. But a great place to take a large group to.. especially for people who can't decided on what to eat!"}
{"text":"Fancy chandaliers with a wine bar stocked with more selection than your average sushi  AYCE restaurant. It does get busy around lunch time and lunch menu is quite extensive even at a price of $12.99 pp. Of course no sashimi, but I`m glad it included the dragons rolls. The red dragon roll could`ve brought this place up to a 4STAR if not for the chefs using smoked salmon instead of fresh.   Pad thai was a huge disappointment, especially if you`ve had authentic ones that are just bursting with flavors of tangy, sweet and spicy. This was plain BLAAANDDD!!!! I did not even touch it. Their beef udon soup was yummy. I asked for spicy sauce on the side and that ended my meal. No ice cream for dessert included, just deep fried banana.  I loved the servers. Very upbeat and friendly. Service was fast.  The fried calamari was on the chewy side with not a lot of the salt and pepper               ``UMPH`` I was expecting.   I have yet to try their dinner selection so I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"i live near the area so i found these place convenient if I get hungry or sushi cravings. i always doubt myself if I should give the restaurant a try because of the negative reviews i saw here in Yelp.  I treated my sister an AYCE dinner one night after work for teaching us a dance number for a company event. The place looks elegant with great chandeliers, huge mirrors on the wall, and spacious seatings inside the restaurant. They have dim lights which is a bit uncomfortable for me cause I couldn see the dinner menu clearly,   My sister and I were really hungry so we ordered a TON of entrees from the menu. (The servers will give you a green sheet wherein you check in the food that you like.) We ordered 16 pieces of fried shrimp tempura, one order of soft shell crab sushi, california roll, dynamite roll, salmon sushi roll, philadelphia roll, four pieces of spring rolls, 12 pieces of salmon sashimi, 4 pieces of white tuna sashimi, 4 pieces of surf clam, 4 pieces of pork siomai, 2 pieces of miso soup,  and i forgot the rest of our order.  i dont know how come we ordered these amount of food for the two of us but we were able to consume everything except for the shrimp tempura.  The sio mai is my favourite dish from Mat su! It tastes like spring rolls' pork siomai but just a little smaller. The spring rolls were so mouth watering too. The tempura were so disappointing. There were too MUCH breading and they were so DRYYY. Bleeh.  The sushi rolls were really big. I mean, the diameter is really wide. The fillings inside each rolls were generous enough to fill you up. i have a small body frame and so does my sister but we were still able to eat every sushi rolls that came in to our table The soft shell crab were soft and gooey in a good way. The salmon sashimi were soft and smooth.  I would come back again at Mat su and recommend it to other people.  *The only thing they need to improve is the decor outside cause it looks so simple and it contrasts the setting that they have inside the restaurant.  i also forgot to mention that the service is superb. They were prompt and courteous when I kept on asking what kind of roll is this and that because they have weird sushi names on the menu and i dont know what's inside each rolls."}
{"text":"Matsu now offers AYCE and a la carte. My Yelp friend got all excited since it is AYCE and he can really stuff his face with food.. and can eat all the ice cream he wants...   Lunch AYCE ($12.99) sounded awesome with this price, since the menu includes both Japanese and Thai food. But I found most of the food tasted bland especially the Thai food... and the sushi and sashimi were disappointed both in presentation and taste.   Dare I say, my maki rolls that I did at my sushi class looks so much better and taste better too!!?? I understand that the \"sushi chefs\" were all overwhelmed but when my rolls came out looks worse than what they have at T&T....   The only item we enjoyed the most are the ice cream.... I felt so much better when I ate my 6 little scoops of ice cream even when I am coughing... cough..cough cough..."}
