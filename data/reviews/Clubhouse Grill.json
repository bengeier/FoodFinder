{"text":"Decent place to watch the game. Food is cheap and decent. There's a little bit of everything from pool tables, darts, shuffle board or relax on the big patio with comfy chairs."}
{"text":"Food is great. Staff is great. Manager is cool. So many diverse activities on each different night of the week. On Wednesdays it turns into nightlife with free prizes from rebel ink and dance competitions with a great dj. The patio is awesome."}
{"text":"The outdoor patio and service were nice but the food was horrible. The sweet potato fries were the absolute worst I have ever tasted in my life and the sandwich wasn't all that great either. The fries tasted like mush soaked in grease and the \"Delight\" sandwich had the consistency of a leftover that had been heated up in the microwave. When I complained about the fries, the server told me to give them another try the next time I'm there but I won't be going back. They should have taken the fries off my bill."}
{"text":"really???  the are skimping back on the food......happy hour OK but wont go to eat again."}
{"text":"Food was great once they added corn beef to my corn beef hash. I don't agree with their policy of not seating parties so they don't overwhelm the kitchen, but once we were seated the server was great.   The bathroom was nasty.  It's very obvious they have new ownership and no management."}
{"text":"This is Arizona not podunk Pennsylvania, guacamole from a bag doesn't work here.  Worst chips and guac ever!  Maybe they took the \"add peas to guacamole\" thing seriously. 

I would have given 1 star but atleast the the service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"45 minutes for burger and fish. Fries way under done. Burger dry and fish was old. Draft beer tasted like lines needed cleaning left 3/4 of a beer on table. Service slow."}
{"text":"Good service. Bartender was fabulous. Dustin!! Nachos were a great portion. Never listen to reviews. Make your own decision about a restaurant. Not every time will be perfect. But. Tonight is!!"}
{"text":"Not sure what is going on with the service in this place recently. Takes forever to get someone to even get a drink order then you get attitude like your bothering them? This is a bar!? We used to be weekly regulars for breakfast and Happy Hour but looks like we may need to find a new hang out.  Also I know the patio is a smoking area but this is Arizona people! We  like to eat outside without getting lung cancer, CH should really consider making it a nonsmoking area. The diehards could step out into the front concourse area to smoke since they can't make it thru lunch without having 7 smokes.  Maybe we will be back when the service and attitude waitresses are  under control."}
{"text":"I had stopped by this place to check it out since I was in the area and let me tell you that will be my last... Where do I start... the food not good, I had ordered the sirloin steak dinner, and I know it's not a steak house but dang... that steak was like cardboard... steamed veggies were not cooked all the way... the mashed potatoes had a very weird taste to them... the waitress was too busy chatting with her co-worker friends who were off the clock and just hanging around... which also made the service really suck at this place... NO management around to keep those girls inline and felt bad for other customers as well. I would advise not to waste your money at this joint... Bad food and Horrible SERVICE!!!"}
{"text":"So my friend and I got off work and decided to find a place open after 12 am. Clubhouse grill met this criteria perfectly. So we arrived, me and my friend used the restroom and then on our way out the security guard said he needed to speak with me outside. We agreed, the logical assumption being we were likely overlooked getting our IDs checked as there was no one to check them at the door. Once outside, the security guard informed me that the bartender and the manager pointed me out as stumbling when I walked in, suggesting that I was drunk. He informed me that I was too intoxicated to be served. Surprised, we kind of laughed at the notion but cooperated ultimately not knowing the full dynamic of the situation. Our assumption is the bartender and the manager pointed out another person, but the security guard chose me incorrectly. This was disappointing as they didn't verify that we were intoxicated. We took this as a sign to not come back."}
{"text":"Bad food.  I would go for drinks to watch sports.  Everything is bad Sysco type food that makes you want to yap."}
{"text":"Monday night football and only two girls working . I don't think the air is working in this place it's very hot."}
{"text":"We went there to have a few drinks with friends.  We walked in happy and ready to have fun. We spotted our friends went over to sit at the booth next to them (there was no one waiting to be seated before us) and we're told we couldn't sit there because there had to be 5 people to sit at a booth.  I asked for a table and was told there were none available.  So again I asked if we could sit at a booth and explained there were 11 of us total we were just the last 4 to arrive (still no one else waiting to be seated) .  I was told no because a party of 5 might show up.  We went with the flow. We ordered our drinks and food and stood near the table to eat.  When a few of us had finished  our food we went over to the other side of the booth (the bar area) to finish our drinks and wait for everyone else. We were then approached by a waitress looking to take our drink order (we had drinks in our hands ) we told her we were good and she told us if we weren't going to order we needed to leave because there was no cover and if we stayed we had to order. We could of and probably should of gotten angry considering total we probably  just spent  $400.00 on food and drink there. We ended up laughing at how ridiculous the whole thing was and left. On the way out I stopped by and explained what happened to the manager and he said sorry but the rude treatment was necessary because sometimes with no cover people just come and hang  out. Ahhhhhh!  Polite people be warned this is no place for us."}
{"text":"I just moved to this area and stopped by for happy hour. The drinks (wine & beer) were pretty cheap, and they tasted that way. I probably shouldn't have expected more at $3 a glass. I noticed that very few people were eating, but I went ahead and ordered some fish tacos. Heads up, their menu choices are extremely limited. I should have taken that as my first clue as to not order something. The fish (fried cod) had too much batter, and the flour tortillas were dry. Add a little bit of lettuce and some diced tomatoes. I asked for a side of guacamole, but was told they don't serve it. Needless to say, I didn't finish it. 
The sign out front says that kids eat free 7 days a week. This is definitely NOT a family friendly place.  Plenty of pool tables, sports TV's and loud music is what they will see. And some raunchy language from those who had plenty of libations. If you are looking for cheap liquor, cheap food and a lot of bar noise, this is the place to go. As for me, I will be looking for \"happiness\" someplace else. 
The only reason I gave this dive one star is because the bartender was pretty attentive."}
{"text":"Just got back from eating there with my 4 year old daughter. They have a special for kids - free meal with adult meal. Last time i was there was 2 months ago -- it was horrible. Thought I'd give it a try again. Gave her the kids menu with pictures, etc. to draw on it but said they were out of crayons (which they also were 2 months ago.) She got 3 soggy, tiny pancakes and then started gagging when she ate some of the fruit. I decided to try it and wanted to throw it up too. It had a horrible flavor and was very soggy. My omelette was very dry, hash browns very greasy, and pancake completely soggy. In fact, I had to speed home because my stomach started knotting up -- luckily I made it in time. This restaurant/bar was good a couple of years ago--not sure what's happened. Good news, there's a new breakfast restaurant on Litchfield Rd and Van Buren which was excellent! Eggs And More?? Can't remember the name, but I'll have to find it and give them 5 stars along with Black Bear Diner."}
{"text":"Compared to my \"west-side\" experiences of the Valley of the Sun, this is a 5 Star sports bar. The food is high-quality and prepared wonderfully as well. Service is attentive and \"truly\" friendly. I love the joint. Very impressed."}
{"text":"THE. WORST. FOOD. ANYWHERE. ON. THE. WEST. SIDE.  I have tried their food 3 times just thinking I would order something else but no it's so bad I can't even finish half of it every single time. I gave it 2 stars because the atmosphere with all the tv's and the large secluded patio plus all the bar seating is great. Only go here if you want to drink."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, nice atmosphere, lots of space and good prices are what make people talk about this place because it is sure not the food.

Go to this place to have a nice time with your friends and have some affordable drinks.  Lots of TVs make this a good place to watch sports and all the room inside and out make you feel like you can sit back and relax.

We went for breakfast and the food was really poor quality.  Nothing tasted well made and it all seemed like low grade boxed/powdered.  I've never had bad biscuits and gravy before Clubhouse.  I've never had a bad pancake before either.  But somehow they managed both.  They need a little more pride in the kitchen and a better supplier.

But regardless of the the low quality food, I would still go back and just not really focus on the food.  As long as you have 0 expectations on the food quality, you'll have a good time."}
{"text":"Am here for a special event - my friends retirement. OMG.... The service is HORRIBLE! ..It took FOREVER to get drinks, food ...anything! (No matter who you ordered from). The food was also terrible. The best thing I had was a decent martini. The Kicker was that the \"special event menu\" is MORE EXPENSIVE than the regular menu and is VERY limited even though the event was NOT private. WOW! The manager was NOT empathetic... Will not be returning."}
{"text":"This place was extremely disappointing. I'm almost glad that we hated the food because the flies overtook our table and landed on EVERYTHING!!! Our service was also pretty poor since we were only checked on once about 2 minutes after the food was brought out and waited with a table full of food that we weren't eating for over 30 minutes. Never have we wanted to just get up and leave without paying but this place wore on our patience since we couldn't eat anything and the flies were obnoxious while we waited for our check. The waitress finally came and handed us the check and when we mentioned that the flies were so bad we didn't eat she just said \"oh yeah the flies have been killing us\" and then proceeded to charge us full price for our bill.  As we walked out the manager asked my husband how it was and he told him about the fly issue. The manager was very polite and told my husband he would void the bill which was very nice of him but the waitress sealed the deal on this one star review since she didn't even attempt to rectify the issue and neglected us for so long."}
{"text":"Stopped in this morning and tried breakfast and was pleasently surprised.  The \"Cardinal Sin\" omelet was outstanding as were the hashbrowns. Great place for breakfast."}
{"text":"Little bit of a hick bar but what do u expect on the outskirts of phx az.  Good food, friendly staff... 2 pool tables, 2 dart boards, couple video games and a seperate dinner area from bar area.  Only slightly negtive thing is country juke box..."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch on a weekday (around 11a).  I like the establishment - plenty of seating indoor and outdoor. There is a water fountain outside that my 2 year old loved. 

We ordered the Reuben meal with sweet potatoe fries, wings, and the French Toast kids meal with fruit.  The wings were extremely dry, so we asked for them to remake them.  The server apologized and brought out a fresh order. All the food was really good and the prices are affordable too. Will come back!"}
{"text":"We love this place . Great close location to my home. Breakfast could have more of a variety to choose from. Prices are reasonable and service is great."}
{"text":"Came here for Bloody Marys and breakfast...there were only four other people in the whole place and only two at the bar, where we sat. It took well over 5 minutes to get some terrible Bloody Marys. Overall, the breakfast wasn't very good, the omelette I had was good (it's hard to mess that up) and my girlfriend said the breakfast burrito was good as well, however the crispy bacon I ordered and the toast that I didn't order were both nasty. The bartender was extremely slow.  The bar itself seems decent, other than the foul smell in the bar area, and the prices were good. We won't be coming back..."}
{"text":"I really like this place. Usually good atmosphere and sweet service. If you are expecting something casual then it's a great spot. Today I went with my family.. it was my 6 year old graduation day from kindergarten and we were hungry so it was convenient.  Laws have recently changed dictating what kind of ID you need to provide to receive alcoholic beverages.  Our friend with us forgot her new ID and still tried to drink. She was completely in the wrong . The manager approached our table... and he was firm as he should be. He needs to protect the business. We were well aware of the situation and waiting on boxes so we can leave, but he does not let up. I can see he is scaring my 6 year old and I try to approach him quietly and he screams at me to not touch him in front of my son. My son is 6 does not understand what is going on... already saw that we were being lectured and asked to leave (which he deserved because of my friend). And now this manager is trying to make it seem as if I am out of control and attacking him.  I just wanted him to know we understand and we will leave so don't say anything more because you are scaring my son. I'm a 5 foot 90 pound girl with zero threats. I wish I would of tipped the waitress more than 10 dollars for approaching the situation professionally, thoughtful of my son, and with great service despite someone in our group being wrong for their actions. Thank you.. my 6 year old was not wrong and did not understand."}
{"text":"After my 1st review, the manager reached out to me addressing my issue. I am happy to say that she took are of the training issue because when I went back a 2nd time I was able to order my regular choice."}
{"text":"Steppin up their game, open floor. Craft beers, hoppin on the weekend. Great DJ! Great bar tenders, I dig it!"}
{"text":"Came here on January 18th to catch the 2nd football game of the night. 

Nice sport bar from the appearance.  2 U shaped bars with lots of tv's above to catch whatever may be on. 

We opted to sit out back since it was nice out and we are smokers. Beautiful patio with a waterfall and heat lamps. TV's outside with corn hole games. 

Only thing I would say is they need to improve on is a waitstaff. We had to continue to get up and go inside to get drinks.... I most likely would have drank more if it was easily accessible. 

Drinks were good.... we didn't eat anything so I can't comment on that."}
{"text":"This is the definition of a dive bar and spot for good eats. They have all sorts of different beers, and a good amount of top shelf spirits. The food is good, and inexpensive. This is also a great spot to go catch a UFC fight free of cover. 

Great Wait staff, Good Bartenders, and a ton of fun. We love this spot."}
{"text":"Wife and I have had breakfast there a few times since moving here in end of September and everything was okay.  Decided to go there for a late lunch yesterday and see how the lunch/dinner food was.  Things started a bit rough and went downhill.  First - table still had syrup all over it from breakfast.  Wife keeps wet wipes with her so we wiped it down.  Ordered drinks and her Cherry Coke had NO carbonation (sent it back and got tea).  Wife ordered Chicken Fried Steak and I just ordered Bacon Cheeseburger.  We were two of only 4 people on the dining side and it took about a 1/2 hour to get our meals.  Mine comes without the bacon.  Waitress takes it back and about 5 minutes later comes out with bacon overheated (yes, microwave bacon) to the point I could use as a chisel.  Before I even bite into my meal, the wife takes a bite of her CFS.  She has a funny look on her face and says it tasts strange.  I took a bit and could not even swallow it!!  I spit it out on a napkin.  The meat (not the sauce...the meat) had a huge sour taste.  Neither of us had EVER tasted anything like this.  At this point we are a bit frustrated, and are still figuring it to be a one off and not judging the whole establishment.  When the waitress comes over I mentioned to her that there is something wrong with the meat and we would just prefer to go somewhere else at this point.  I did state that they may want to check their storage and make sure everything was okay.  About 10 minutes later a manager (or at least by title) comes over.  He says he tasted it and it was fine (during our short conversation he states same thing 3 more times and at one point says he does not understand why we are being a problem).  He asks me why I have not even tried my burger and I stated that after tasting the meat, I am leary about eating here and that I was not going to eat in front of my wife (she was NOT going to accept anything else at this point).  After being very confrontational, unprofessional, and just a plain PUNK, the manager leaves.  We sat there for another 15 minutes waiting to see what they were going to bill us for before the waitress (now with HUGE attitude) bellows from across the dining hall, \"He has taken care of the bill...you all can leave\".

Go at your own risk.  My wife felt slightly sick for a few hours after we left.  That CFS was bad (I am quite certain rotten).  Service, attitude, etc. adds to their problems."}
{"text":"Sometimes it's just not the food that you rate.


The Clubhouse Grill is a good sport's bar with great service and friendly staff. There are TV's all over the place.  It doesn't get much better then watching every NFL game simultaneously on Sunday's.

The service is always top notch, drinks are refilled promptly and the servers are very attentive without being intrusive. However, the food entrées just aren't very good.  Some of the entrées are similar to cafeteria food and  barely warm when served.  

The Clubhouse Grill is one of the places I go to watch a \"game\", sometimes it's just not the food you rate."}
{"text":"We accompanied my mom here so she could play poker. We had a meal. My husband ordered Chicken Parmesan and I had the Coyote burger. The coyote burger was great. The chicken parm on the other hand arrived on top of a cold bed of pasta. We let the manager know. We didn't ask for anything. However I have been in the F&B industry for more than 10 years. As a manager I would have comped the meal, provided a dessert or comped one of the drinks as a gesture.  Nothing was done. Wait staff are great but either the manager doesn't have the power to make gestures like this or just doesn't care. We will be back but will never order the parm again."}
{"text":"Nice little dive bar. It's right around the corner from my house, so that's nice. Food is actually pretty good and it's not too costly. The only thing that made it lose a star was the darts. They had great dart boards, but all of the darts are either broken or crooked. Kind of a big reason why I went there. 

But if you're not a dart player, the bar is all around good!"}
{"text":"Checked it out because I was in the mood to play some pool but ended up not playing at all and leaving after a quick bite to eat and a drink.
The two pool tables are set up in a weird location that made me feel uncomfortable playing. The Philly cheese steak that I had was alright but the stick fries were a no-go. Someone explained that they're suppose to be that hard -but I'd rather not risk breaking a tooth in an attempt to eat french fries. My vodka cranberry was good.
Sat at the bar and people watched a bit - the staff, they're nice but seem inexperienced or uncomfortable with connecting with their customers. The manager hovered around the servers and by the kitchen more than walking his floor and checking on his bar staff and customers. He seemed bored and uninterested. 
But the TV set up for watching games at the bar is great."}
{"text":"The waitress today earned them another star she was great!  They also have opened up the area by removing all the booths, it looks pretty great!"}
{"text":"Terrible service and managers that don't care. Had my cc taken by the bartender to the be given to a waitress who was supposed to be taking over and at the end of the Night the waitress miss placed our credit card and instead of owning up to it being misplaced said that they give it back to us me in particular and the card wasn't even mine. So we waited for two hours for the police to arrive because our card is now believed to be stolen only to have the waitress come out apologizing suddenly after multiple lives of where the card was in it was in her shirt that she had taken off because it was warm. You would think you would've check your pockets before accusing that the card was given back. And not surprised that somebody else had the same thing happened to them we had hopedthat this would've been our new hangout spot but we will never go back again. And the food is not that great"}
{"text":"Beautiful Dog Friendly Patio with sweet calming 
waterfall. Great service by Kristel....puppy dog rescuer!! Sandwiches nice.,.fresh French fries!! An Oasis in Goodyear! Sadie sez 4 paws Up!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast this morning. Lots of lack of organization. Took forever to get coffee, and even longer to get a second cup. My husband ordered a cowboy omelet with hash browns and a pancake. He received something completely different than the cowboy omelet, the hash browns were cold and greasy and the pancake had been ready for a while. I ordered a number 3, which was bacon, two pancakes, and 2 eggs. I got my pancakes when my husbands breakfast came out. About 5 minutes later I got my bacon, about 10 minutes later I got my eggs. Not impressed at all."}
{"text":"From the old owners catering to his friends first to now the new owners and management having horrible horrible service, this place is something you should pass on.   Recently gave it another chance, Father's Day, and sat there for an hour while other people got their food and was told that they accidentally burned our breakfast. Come to find the waitress merely forgot to put it in and gave us no updates. Then the manager told us that we have not been waiting that long.   Zero customer service, mediocre food and a lot of weird clientele. Stay away."}
{"text":"I went here for breakfast on a Saturday and had the biscuits and gravy, which claim to be homemade.....I don't think so. The biscuits were very dry and the gravy tasted like crap. My husband had a pork chop with his eggs and  was very disappointed in the taste and it was very fatty. Will not go back for breakfast. I have heard that it is a nice place to hang out with friends for a drink."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, reasonable prices. I was there with a large crowd and Amber was our waitress. She did a great job and didn't miss a beat with the orders. First time there and it was a great overall experience. Would go again for sure."}
{"text":"Wasn't going to stop here because of all the.bad reviews but glad I did bartender was awesome food was typical bar food wasn't very busy so service was great would recommend stopping in playing some darts and pool on an off night. Also the patio was nice"}
{"text":"Great Bar to hang with friends or burn \"bored\" time.

The food was good and the price point made this a good value for the food and drinks. Weekly poker tournaments and scary-oke with actual cash prizes for the winners. It was a packed bar but still the food came out hot and fast. Minor glitch in my order but it was fixed with ease immediately. This would make a perfect UFC bar, so hopefully they will catch the trend soon. This is a great example of what a sports bar should be.

plus the sweet potato fries and secret sauce are pretty much the best thing I have ever tasted."}
{"text":"The first time I stumbled upon this place it was great! Great prices on drinks, fun with darts, good atmosphere with the dj. The second time I went back we went to get food. We waited forever for someone to even acknowledge our existence. The food came slow, and cold. It was overpriced for being cooked in a microwave. The third time we came my partner was told he could not vape. But there were three other couples at the bar that were vaping. We also tried to get the ladies night drink specials, they told us they started at 7 but then when we checked out with the receipt they told us it was not until 9 pm. SO I am very surprised that we could have such different interactions at this place. I really liked everything about it my first time checking it out but not sure I would ever be back after the food and the staff have no idea what is going on. Just a bit confusing."}
{"text":"10/28/2015
I love sitting outside at the ClubHouse Grill on Litchfield and Indian School. I was never over the moon about the food, but I have had good nachos there, and rubens, burgers, etc.... Today, however, changed my opinion. YUCK!
Three of us gals went in for lunch. I had an egg salad sandwich on wheat. It came toasted, with mayo spread on the bread. It was runny and had too much mayo in the egg salad to begin with. This came with cold, overcooked fries. My friend's fries were the same way and one had a toasted piece of sourdough bread on her sandwich that was almost burnt black and bounced like a hockey puck. OK, now comes the good part. After telling the waitress, (who said they always serve it that way - toasted) she brought me another egg salad sandwich, still with mayo spread on the inside and the bread was stale. She did bring a new basket of fries that were a little less cooked, but still tasted weird. Then the manager came out and proceeded to make excuses. She was flustered and mad and had an attitude with us. No apologetic talk or expression whatsoever. I would NOT recommend this place until they re-train their cook / and also take a second look at how they prepare and present their food. Yuck. the waitress apologized and tried to make it right several times, however, with one look at that food I would have never brought it out to a customer to begin with. The manager jst gets a big thumbs down from us.

The food was bad there today, but then came the bill. They had taken off my sandwich and discounted my friend's meal. Printed on the bill was the following:

% COMP; GR ANGRY FOOD OVERC  (meaning we were mad the food was overcooked?) - -- and

REPEATED COMPLAINTS

Really sets a nice tone to see that on your way out, and under it says
Thank You!
See you Soon!

Methinks not, indeed."}
{"text":"Used to have dammed good burger and fries.
Just been served the worst looking fries ever.
After tasting tonight's burger,  also the driest worst burger I have had and that includes McDonalds!!!"}
{"text":"I was regular here until today. My family comes here for breakfast almost every Sunday. Today, we were told we could not have a booth even though there was one available. The hostess told me it was reserved for football fans. We were seated a table where we were so close to the couple behind us I felt like I was sitting in his lap. We ordered our drinks and asked to speak to the manager about this new policy. Two more booths were open and were given to people who came after us. I finally got the manager who acted like he really did not care or want our business. I told him what happened and he asked me if they offered to put us on a waiting list for a booth. I told him it was never presented to me as an option as I was not a football customer as the hostess and our server said.  He said he'd be back and went to talk to the hostess. My server came back and asked if we were going to order food like we planned. I said no that I wanted to cash out. She told me the manager took care of my ticket. None of the regular servers were there. They were not slammed with people. There was no excuse for such shoddy customer service. They have lost my family as customers."}
{"text":"My sister in law went to this place hearing wonderful things. They have a wonderful back patio and were seated right away. Hostess was very nice and helpful with the menu. My sister in law ordered the Reuben and she loved it. I ordered the Buffalo wings and they came really DRY. Unfortunately I had to send them back. They came back delicious and tender. Minus one star for having to send my food back. Overall good. Will go back!"}
{"text":"Walking in noticed how greasy the place smells. The food was just as bad."}
{"text":"Not a bad sports bar. Couple of pool tables, several flat screen tv's and a half dozen of beers on tap.

They have a decent bar food menu. Had some of their wings. Their hot sauce is pretty hot and their \"extremely hot\" is well...extremely hot.

They also have some free wi-fi. This place is also kid friendly. Customer service was decent as well.

Looks like a bunch of locals that hang out. If you need to watch a certain sports event, then this venue is the place for people who live in Goodyear."}
{"text":"Loved it!  Great SERVICE by bartenders!  The owner was very friendly!  Great prices on food and drinks!  They have something fun going on every night!  We will be back!!"}
{"text":"I went there for breakfast with my husband and parents. I ordered the eggs, hashbrowns and toast. I like my hashbrowns crispy so I asked for them that way, done well. I received my order and the eggs were brown and I probably could have thrown them across the room and they would've stayed in one piece. The hashbrowns were warm and as raw and soft as could be without being raw. I told the waitress and she took my plate, returned it with the same hash browns blackened. I'm not being dramatic at all. Needless to say, I only ate the toast. While the waitress told the manager what happened, I had passed by to go to the bathroom and heard them talking. So I know the manager was aware. Just a side note, I also witnessed the cook shoving food into his mouth while cooking. Don't these people watch Kitchen Nightmares? So the manager didn't come over to see what the problem was. I will never eat here again. I ended up going across the street to Ground Control and getting a delicious breakfast sandwich. All I have to say is, eat at your own risk of yuckiness!!"}
{"text":"I should have trusted my fellow Yelpers and their horrible reviews, but we decided to give this place a shot and, well, you all were right. Flat beer and gross food. When we first entered we almost immediately felt we made the wrong choice going here. Total dive bar atmosphere. We decided to eat on the back patio and we were swarmed with cigarette smokers galore. Anyhow, we ordered a few draft beers and they tasted horribly flat and stale. My husband got the chicken wings and they came out with these marks on them like they were reheated on a flat grill top. He said they  didn't taste freshly cooked to order and
very dry. I don't know why I chose the chicken parmesan dinner at a sports bar, but I did, and it was a horrible decision. The sauce tasted like straight up canned tomato sauce with garlic powder all over it. The garlic bread was also just covered in fake garlic powder. So nasty. We definitely won't return."}
{"text":"Just had the worst experience EVER at this place. We were seated in a booth that was not only dirty but dilapidated and rickety. After ordering our drinks, we chose to sit outside instead. Big mistake. Paco and Maria were out there as well and proceeded to turn on the TV in order to watch their favorite Telemundo Soap Opera at the loudest level possible. When asked to lower the volume, they declined stating it wasn't possible. When we asked the staff for assistance, the timid little girl caved into their needs to have the volume at max level. Again we moved, back inside advising the outside scenario was unacceptable. When we came in, the server asked if we wanted our drinks in, too. Well, yes, that would be nice. Sadly, she had no clue who's was who's and didn't know what to do. We told her to bring us fresh coffee and waters, make it simple. At this point, we've been here 30 minutes & still have yet to be served. Is this how a restaurant makes it??  
Now, we have a table of 14 elderly fat people who seem to feel it necessary to squeeze in between my guest and their table. Coffee has been spilled and attitudes are flaring. Not a good experience whatsoever!!! This place may be fun at night but Sunday breakfast is NOT a place to go."}
{"text":"I like their new menu. I have been there twice since the new ownership. First time was ok, second time was a service disaster. Forgotten items, no drink refills without requesting each time, no follow up from the manager when problems developed. Nice enough server but obviously wasn't trained properly."}
{"text":"The DJ playing was amazing however the staff was asked by 15 people to turn up the air and the answer was they cant they don't have access. It's Summer what the heck. Advice leave someone in charge to control the air conditioner and clean the beer lines the beer was flat."}
{"text":"Clubhouse has a great layout for watching multiple games.  Food was good ... But The service was great!   Kayla was a great server, friendly and took great care of us."}
{"text":"There was a roach on the wall.   A roach.   A bloody roach!!!
We went there for dinner with friends.  We were in one of the booths. The wall had a hole in it where the table met the wall.  A roach crawled out!!  We tried to kill it but it's a roach, we were shocked.  It crawled on the table back to the wall and into the hole.  We stopped eating immediately.  They comped us the food.  We didn't eat it.  But we had to pay for the drinks.  I was looking for bugs in my drink.  I couldn't drink it.  I watched too much Bar Rescue.
Never going there again.  If you have 1 roach willing to come out of a wall in a crowded restaurant, there are thousands in the walls.  Gross gross gross."}
