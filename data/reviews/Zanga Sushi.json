{"text":"Sushis et makis sans aucune saveur, avec peu de poisson ou du poisson caoutchouteux. Je ne le recommande pas du tout, sans doute les pires sushis et makis que j'ai jamais mangés."}
{"text":"Commandé avec just eat. Impossible de savoir quels sont les sushis qui vous serons envoyés. De même, la promotion spéciale des pieces supplémentaires au delà de 25$ est une intox. Les sushis sont de qualité passable, je mets 3/5 pour le prix qui est correct pour une qualité moyenne."}
{"text":"Tried ordering from this place once and what I got were square shaped sushi pieces with paper thin slices of smelly fish. It didn't smell rotten, but as if it had been sitting at room temperature for a while. I couldn't even eat it, I gave all the fish to my cat. Very gross, I could only stomach the cucumber sushis. Not even the avocado ones because the avocado was old and brown!"}
{"text":"Awful sushi. Everything is just tempura filling. Very little fish. Got most of our order wrong. Would NEVER eat here again."}
{"text":"I've ordered from this place a few times from just-eat. The sushi is not great but the price was attractive. Everything filled with cucumber which leaves very little space for the fish itself. 

Sometimes it takes like it has been prepared hours before. The delivery person is always unfriendly and in a hurry. Not one of them have ever said \"hi\" or even thanked me for the tip offered. 

I've made a promise not to order from this place again. Even though it is quite cheap in comparison to other sushi restaurants that deliver in my area it is just not worthy."}
{"text":"Je n'ai pas du tout apprécié les sushis que je me suis fait livre..
Le poisson n'avait pas franchement de goût et les makis/futomakis étaient pour la plupart d'entre eux insipides....
Le pire est qu'en plus je les ai attendus plus d'une heure!
Le tout pour un prix pas mal élevé.....je ne renouvellerai pas l'expérience!"}
{"text":"Great Dragon roll (that came complimentary with the order of 30$+). We got some desert sushi, which were truly awful however (then again, when is desert sushi ever good). Ingredients taste fresh. 

The taste was quite good, would have rated it higher if not for the ridiculous (70 minute...!) wait after ordering for delivery."}
{"text":"So, I ordered from this place from Just Eat. They have a special - 6 free Hosomakis with an order over over 10$. I received my order but not the free Hosomakis that I was entitled to. I called the guy up on the phone (who made me wait on the line) and finally DENIED THAT THIS SPECIAL EVEN EXISTED. I mean, I have both the website and the flyer right in front of my face. I mean, does this guy take me for a complete moron??? I tell him that I will no longer be ordering from them in the future and this guy makes a \"oooh\" sound, in the tune of \"poor baby\", ie mocking me! Finally, he says that he will have a delivery guy bring them over, which never happened. 
Seriously, this place sucks a** for so many reasons."}
