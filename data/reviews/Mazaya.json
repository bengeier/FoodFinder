{"text":"Won't talk about the environment or the food . Sheeshas here are very good , and what keeps me from coming back here is the super friendly staff ! Always feel welcomed and comfortable."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with my coworkers. Other than us, there were two other tables, so we assumed service should be decent.. We were wrong.

Our server was incredibly slow doing everything. We watched one table try to pay, and the poor woman was at the counter for 5 to 10 minutes while the guy tried to figure out the debit machine. Perhaps it was down, so I can't 100% sure blame it on him. However, when we wanted to order, despite us having our menus in a pile he sat behind his bar and just chilled out. It took him another 5-10 minutes to pour 3 waters and 2 iced teas, and throughout our time there he never came around to check how things were, despite having time to sit at a table and smoke shisha. The plus side is he was very nice, and he immediately turned down the music when we asked.

However, when our food came, my friend and I had ordered tabouleh salad with our wraps. They wound up coming out with Greek salad. When my friend said 'This doesn't look like tabouleh' he assured us that our romaine lettuce with tomatoes was actually tabouleh. She had to speak up again to get the salads taken back and replaced with what we ordered. We also had to ask two different people to bring us cutlery.

As for the food itself, all my coworkers enjoyed it, but I didn't. I thought the tabouleh was too lemony - half the bowl it came in was filled with lemon juice. Also, the falafel itself was incredibly crunchy, to the point where it was like chewing on large grains of sand. I perfer mine a bit more smooth. The wrap it came in had obviously been sitting on the grill for too long, because it was like trying to bite through plastic. That being said, other than the chewy wraps my coworkers did like their food, so it is probably just an issue of preference.

I will never go back here, and I would not recommend the restaurant to anyone else. However, it may still have promise as a shisha bar."}
{"text":"First saj shawarma in Mississauga . Shawarma was good and fries crispy.

Plate was good"}
{"text":"Love this place, very good shisha amazing vibes n atmosphere, excellent food and beautiful belly dancers on Saturday evenings as well as a DJ. I recommend Mazaya to everyone."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. First off, they have a really nice patio and it is perfect to hang out on during the summer. Service is a bit inconsistent. I've been here on nights where's it's super busy and service was quite attentive. But, once I came in with a few school friends during the week and even though we were one of three tables, service was very slow. Our waitress had a very blase attitude and it took a really long time for our sheesha to arrive. At one point, I saw a guy hanging out behind the bar texting. I have worked in the industry and it is common knowledge that you should never let a customer see you on your personal phone. It's just unprofessional. The food is pretty good here. I got a Chicken Shawarma and it was yummy, but extremely garlicky. Now I love garlic, so this is not an issue for me. But, my friend found it to be too garlicky and she didn't enjoy it.

I can only give 3 stars because it is just okay. The food and sheesha are both good, but service is inconsistent. Sometimes, I've lucked out and had a great server. But, most of the time, the service has been extremely slow. I will say that I love their patio and would go back to hang out on it though."}
{"text":"I bought the shawarma pouting to go. It was in the worlds smallest box for $15 dollars I added a tip and services about 15 minutes longer than they said it would take. When I confronted server about my order being such a small portion for the price she assured me there was more in the box then I thought. There wasn't. :-/ disappointed feel ripped off"}
{"text":"Unfortunately we were not even served when we tried out Mazaya. My boyfriend ordered a hookah (I have never tried it before so I was excited to try) and we watched multiple tables who had sat down after us receive their pipes. We ordered tea and a drink, that arrived, but our food and our pipe had still not arrived. We cancelled the order for both after waiting for such a long time. Neither the server nor manager apologized, just let us pay for the drinks and walk out. Absolutely appalling service and I would never go back. I have worked in the restaurant and bar industry for a long time and every contact I have that has mentioned it has heard of my experience."}
{"text":"I have had many Shawarma sandwiches in Canada and they are pretty much in a pita bread which kind of makes it a North Americanized Shawarma except  here, it is as authentic as it gets and is by far the best Shawarma I've had anywhere in North America.
There are lots of very good and delicious Shawarma restaurants but they are all imitations but never duplicated properly until now. I had some of their freshly squeezed juice and enjoyed it very much.
Excellent job from service to the food which is very comparable to the middle eastern countries."}
{"text":"I'm not dealing with anymore hookah places in this city ever again. This one was just sketchy. Slow service and shifty eyes staring at you when you're wondering where your food is. If you have better things to do than run your cousins laundro.. I mean restaurant, then go do that and hand it over to someone who cares about customers."}
{"text":"The service is horrible.  Our server was miserable beyond anything I have seen. Didn't clear our table from food but sit doe with the table beside to party. No water. Never asked if we wanted anything else. Zero tip for her. My god. Get a clue."}
{"text":"It was our first time going to Mazaya as we have been meaning to try it for some time given it is conveniently located near our place.

The space is smaller than it appears from the outside. We were greeted and seated quickly. The service was slower than ideal and our waters were not refreshed during our stay.

Once the food finally arrived, it was decent and quite flavourful. The meat was a little dry but still very tasty. 

Lastly when requesting our bill there was a longer than expected wait."}
{"text":"Visited this place twice.  The food was exceptionally good however the service was terrible. On our first visit we requested plain rice instead of coconut and the server said no problem, second visit the sever said we only have coconut rice and we dont make plain rice ever even though several of their dishes are served with plain rice..   The second time we were also told that they lost there liquor license.  Music sucked and the entire time ghetto Mexican tunes were played, when we requested a more middle eastern feeling music they laughed and turned up the crap music .  Over all disappointed as the food was amazing."}
{"text":"Best Place EVER !!!!!!! 
Great atmosphere, food, music, variety of drinks and sheesha. 
Awesome location too. Marda Loop's best spot hands down. The space is beautiful, clean and friendly. Been there over a dozen times and always had great service and warm welcome. On busy nights they will make sure to help you find a table, never had to wait long to accommodate me even when it's packed. Love love love this place. Everyone should check it out."}
{"text":"I have been searching for the perfect shawerma sandwich for quite some time and I FOUND IT.. 
this place beats all the other ones.. the service is good and the food is delicious.. I I highly recommend the chicken shawerma, it is wrapped in SAJ bread which is a middle eastern signature and much tastier than pita and flatbread.
They have been in business a few months and I hope they continue because I am hooked.. they also offer home delivery in mississauga!"}
{"text":"Did this restaurant go out of business? Been there and it's closed, called several times with no reply.. please advise ... it's a pity because it was really good...
Looking forward to the reply"}
{"text":"When I heard that Mazaya had opened up in the old Narah building, I knew I had to check it out ASAP. I was not disappointed.

With a similar feel to the old Narah, Mazaya is a similar style with even better service. Having only had a lemonade and some double apple mint sheesha. Everything about my experience was of the highest quality, but my friend was less impressed with his coffee because he didn't know what to expect. I did not order any food but I will be back soon to try. The very nice waitress informed us that the full menu has not launched yet but it should be available starting Sept. 1.

I'll be back very soon and will definitely update after trying the food."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and terrible management. It's a perfect representation of the middle-east, minus the bloodshed of course!

The waitress was totally drunk which I found quite funny. The irony of a drunk blond under the scripture-like Arabic text was not lost on me. 

We waited forever for our food but I was very happy after the first bite. Their skewered meats are slightly on the over-cooked side but authentic nevertheless. 

I'll order their food if they deliver but I won't go back."}
{"text":"OMG! Mazaya was one of the best chicken shawarmas I tried in a very very long time in Mississauga! Ask for the shawarma to be in the Saj bread and garlic sauce/ pickles on the side! Magnificent taste! Decor was cute just like the place. See my video and pictures."}
{"text":"We arrived at this plaza in the mood for some Middle Eastern fare, and given that I didn't recognize Mazaya, I figured this would be a good opportunity to try something new.

It's a cool little joint with authentic plates decorating the walls and loud, ceaseless Arabic music playing over the speakers. (I'll admit that the music did get a little oppressive after a while.)

I decided to go with one of my favorite dishes, a Chicken Shawarma Wrap (\"tomato, cucumber, pickles, turnips\"). I placed the order and we took a seat to wait for our food.

We waited. And then we waited some more. After almost a half hour's worth of waiting, our food was finally ready. (Apparently the delay was due to the made-from-scratch preparation of my dining companion's falafel. Surely there's a way to offer fresh falafel without making the customer wait so long?)

Anyway, it's a good chicken shawarma wrap. The plentiful chicken tastes fresh and juicy, while the accompanying garlic sauce packs a lot of zing and flavor. The problem is, though, that you don't really taste much else aside from that garlic sauce. If there were any tomatoes, cucumber, or turnips in the wrap, I didn't taste them. There's an excessive saltiness to the dish that grows a little tiresome after a while (i.e. every bite is exactly the same).

Still, I happily ate the whole thing and I'd probably eat it again, although next time I might order a side dish to kind of break the monotony of the wrap."}
{"text":"Preface:  This is not a review based on an \"authentic\" shawarma as I don't have any first-hand knowledge of what that looks, tastes like.

Mazaya presents shawarma in a different way and that is why you might be drawn here.  As mentioned by other reviewers, shawarma is rolled up on saj, a flatbread.  Although it didn't have any specific taste, it was not as dry as pita.

Ordering:  I approached the cash, with a friend, as we had some questions.  It took the guy a moment to come out from the back.  There was no bell to summon him.

We asked whether or not the \"Mazaya Special\" (~$15), which is a chicken shawarma platter, was good enough for 2ppl to share and he said yes.  Then he proceeded to punch in \"Mixed Platter\" ($21) which was a few dollars more expensive.  I was confused as this \"Mixed Platter\" did not appear anywhere on the menu.  However, I let it slide since the guy said it contained 2 sandwiches and price was still ok for 2ppl.

As per my photo, the Mazaya Special consisted of rolled up chicken shawarma, with fries (similar to Costco), and a side dish of pickles.  Chicken itself was a tad too salty, which is very common for shawarma, and seasoning was slightly different than at other places that I have been too with hints of nutmeg/cinnamon &/or clove.  White sauce did not taste like garlic and did not have any specific taste.  Pickles were a nice addition to cut the salt of the meat.

Mazaya is an order at the counter, wait, and dine-in OR takeout.  Most of the patrons seemed to speak the same language as the man who ran the counter.

Service:  Man at the counter was apathetic when we had questions.  However, he seemed to lighten his tone after we finished eating and asked how everything was.

There seems to be A LOT of Middle Eastern places in this U-shaped plaza, so there is a lot of immediate competition.  The things that make Mazaya standout though seem to be decor and how food is presented."}
{"text":"I live in the area and frequent 33rd avenue shops, restaurants and services. The food is ok, but the service is pretty bad. I understand when people have \"off days\", so that might have been the case. They have a really good sheesha selection, so if you are just looking for sheesha and no meal, then it would be the place to go. I would go again for sheesha, but I would have dinner beforehand."}
{"text":"I've been coming here quite often to study for finals. The staff are always super friendly and helpful. Not to mention they don't seem to mind that I sit here for hours and study. Service has always been awesome and the food here is SO good. I have been a server for many years and most often during the day there is only one to two staff members on. They basically have to do everything including making the drinks  and sheesha, which when it gets busy is really impressive. The managers Tiffany and Corey are rad. They even give discounts to students and their $11 sheesha happy hour is such a good deal. I will definitely keep coming back."}
{"text":"This place has gone through so many owners, name changes and staff that unfortunately it wasn't for the better. What once used to be a popular place in a good location (especially in summer) with good food and sheesha, has lost most of this value and quality. The service has plummeted tremendously and is extremely poor. If you're not a regular or you don't have any connections to the staff/owners, don't expect them to be checking in with you. The weekends are not enjoyable at all as they BLAST their music in an extremely small space that you are forced to scream to have a conversation AND they randomly started to charge $5 cover for the weekend? Hard pass. The one star goes to the food, but I've had better."}
