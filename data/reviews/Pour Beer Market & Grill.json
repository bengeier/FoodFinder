{"text":"Good food. Great wait staff. Nice layout. Good drinks. However not everyone wants to watch UFC fights. 2 TV's playing crap comedy shows all the rest playing UFC. Hockey fans deserve a TV."}
{"text":"Un. Believable. We popped in here for brunch with some friends since there was a massive wait at a more popular breakfast place in the area. We had been here before to try the different craft beers, but had never experienced the food menu.  The decor is beautiful and whoever designed it has fabulous taste, but that is the extent of my positivity about this place.  I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich of sorts and what I got has turned me off chicken for the foreseeable future. The sandwich itself was bland, but being hungry I got through the first half kind of just deciding I would never order this particular item again if we came back. What I got with the first bite of my second half is what this review is about.   I bit into the sandwich and got a mouthful of grizzle and fat so I popped open the sandwich after spitting my bite out and pulled out a huge chunk of fat. My Hubs (not being as picky as me) thought I was over exaggerating and went to eat it and what he got he had to spit out as well.  After sending it back, someone (I am assuming a shift manager, she didn't introduce herself) came out and asked what was wrong with it. I explained my complaint and she said the kitchen staff had examined the carnage and agreed it was sub par.  I told her I was shocked that any person with half a brain would send something of this poor quality out of the kitchen, let alone expect a paying guest to consume it. She offered me 50% off my sandwich as a gesture of their apology. I laughed a little (while just shaking my head) because I didn't feel like arguing about it, but what if I had taken that half to eat first? Unfortunately she affected our servers tip and I believe she owes our server the difference.   So, I will \"take\" your 50% off the sandwich (a lousy apology, by the way, for my disturbing experience) and I will \"see\" you one review.  See you \"never\"!"}
{"text":"Was there last Saturday at about 11, sat down for 20 minutes with my girl and no serving staff came up to us at all. A few looked right at us as they walked by to the couple of occupied tables but other than that nothing. We left and went to another place in town but I am pretty concerned as we are a mixed race couple and were completely ignored. As we were leaving I noticed all the staff just hanging out at the bar with the bartender chit chatting. I don't think it's fair to say their behaviour was racist but completely without any class is probably accurate."}
{"text":"A great place to enjoy a great selection of beers on tap, either local or worldwide. Many beers are available by the bottle, some of them are really unique and hard to find. This place is nowhere near the level of Craft Beer Market (in Calgary, Edmonton, Vancouver, etc), but certainly a better selection than probably all other pubs in Airdrie. I will come back."}
{"text":"Arrived Friday March 10 around 8 pm was fairly busy got seated and forgotten.   Found menu selection not vegan friendly after waiting about 20 minutes no further contact from waitress for drinks although she did look at us but never got drinks served.   Mark this place for drinks only although happy hour value better across the street."}
{"text":"Decided to have dinner here based on the yelp reviews and was not disappointed.    They have a great beer selection and the waitress (Tia) was great offering suggestions right away without prompting.  I settled on the berries and cream which was a mix of fruli strawberry and velvet fog (wheat beer) I'm not a beer drinker and this was sooooo good.  Not too sweet but didn't have the beer taste that I dislike.  My friend and I both ordered the personal pizza since they were half off on Wednesday.  I got the carne and it was good but a touch on the salty side.  Also all of the sauce was pushed towards the crust.  My friend got the margherita pizza and he said if it didn't have cheddar on it that it would have been superb but he still liked it.   Service was really fast and quite friendly.  I would definitely dine here again as they have a very good menu."}
{"text":"We had high hopes for this place since it rated higher than other bars in Airdrie but we were disappointed by the food.  My pizza was bland and they didn't bring the parmesan cheese shaker I'd asked for. Service was good and prompt for the most part although they did forget one of the meals - everyone had finished their meal by the time we thought we should check on it and eventually it did arrive.  A friend commented on a strange taste from all the beers on tap that he'd tried and whilst the food wasn't awful none of us spoke highly of our meals and we'd probably choose to return to other bars in the area before coming back here.  Points for the decor though - the chandeliers were very pretty albeit seemed a little out of place."}
{"text":"The Gold standard for Calmari. Very lightly breaded, excellent tzatziki sauce and cooked to an amazing tenderness.  Bratwurst and mashed were gently seasoned. The sausage was quite lean and not greasy.  The Black & Blue was full of flavour, with just the right amount blue cheese. I did find the beef patty slightly over done for my taste.  Don't miss the extensive beer menu. The sampler paddle gives you four 5oz draft choices.  A bit on the noisy side, but great for groups."}
{"text":"Finally, a place to go in Airdrie that doesn't feel like a last resort when we don't want to drive into Calgary. Great food, great service, great ambiance! We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I recently moved to the area and since my husband loves different types of beers we gave this place a try. The decor is really beautifully designed and there are lots of TV screens which are great for watching sports. The food is quite good, the waitress told me that they make everything in house including the salad dressings and the food has been pretty good. I really like their salads but had the steak sandwich one evening and pizza the next. All fresh and tasty. The service has always been pretty good and I will totally go back."}
{"text":"This is for the location..  The name of this establishment is mispelled, it should be POOR. Poor service, poor food quality and poor dining experience!  Service was extremely slow, An hour for any food to appear and when it did the butter chicken was horrible. Rubbery chicken and mushy rice.  The manager actually told us he had three or for complaints about the chicken over the past three or for days about the chicken being rubbery. Don't you think that it kinda the first clue to do something about it?? Here is a hint, stopping using frozen chicken laden with water. Won't be back, ever!"}
{"text":"First time here, and we got in around 7:30 on a weeknight. The place was quiet, so we grabbed a booth in a vacant part of the bar.  The waitress got to us quickly, and the specials were quite good, but we opted to browse the drink menu and just share some appys. The bar has a very good beer selection, with a few hard to find picks as well. In a huge fan of Granville Island's Lion Winter Ale, and it was I tap, so grabbed a pint. My boyfriend got an IPA, and our friend grabbed a fruity beer, and contented ourselves looking at the menu. The waitress was super attentive, and took our orders quickly.   The apps we got we're good, but not fantastic. Veggie platter was large and with a good variety, but the broccoli was sad and limp, and some of the veggies were a bit flavorless. The fried pickle spears we ordered were also pretty good, with about 8 spears on a beer batter - not the best I've had (better with less batter), but I'd order them again.   Overall, a good experience. 4/5, taking a star for the veggie plate."}
{"text":"It's changed quite a bit since it was Dicks Pub. They have changed the menu, added a liqour store worth of beer, and made it a decent experience. Food is all ok, not the best in town, but I have only tried a few menu items. Tons of draft beer. I can't even guess at how many. Staff is pretty good at giving suggestions on what to try, so go out on a limb and try that new brew!"}
{"text":"Pour Beer Market is a HUGE improvement on what used to be in this location.  The ambiance is great. The restaurant is tastefully decorated.   The waitstaff are generally really good, and they work very hard. Sometimes it seems like it takes forever to get your beer/food/water but keeping in mind this isn't necessarily your servers fault, maybe the manager should have more staff on during peak times.   The food is fantastic. Either myself or my friends have tried a variety of things on the menu and none of us have been disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food, great service.  Love the Deep fried Dill Pickles, and the Parmesan Wings!  Bonus points for being within stumbling distance to home."}
{"text":"When we walked in our waitress greeted us in a rude manner just tossed the menus on the table. She was swearing every second word even calling he boss the c word. Very unprofessional the food was very below average for the price. Safe to say I will not be going back there."}
{"text":"This place has a bunch of beer menu including some non-alcohol. The server was very nice and friendly. Foods are good too. My wife had a vegie burger with a big mushroom and tomato, it was really great. My fish tacos are so huge that I had a hard time to manage in a good way. Only issue that make us give one less star out of 5 is the onion soup that was really salty. It might be over cooked or just old. but overall good and we will visit again"}
{"text":"After Our Last experience at Pour, We were very reluctant on trying it again.  But after speaking to Manager Tony, He reassured us that the service we had received was below their standards, and he would make our next dinning experience the best we ever had if we would give them a second chance.  Tonight we came in for dinner... The service:  She was the center a the fantastic evening we had! she was friendly and professional! She new the menu extensively, and she was so humble and gracious!   The Food; We started with the margheritta tarts, the flavor in this prefect little portion of cheesy tomato/basil was heaven in our mouths!!  My Husband had the Piri Piri Chicken w/Potato, The most amazing blend of citrus and spice, which they displayed beautifully across the plate.  I had the New York Steak cooked to perfection (Blue Rare)mouth-watering seasoned veggy, with a side ceasar accompanied with real bacon bits!!!!!!   That was the best steak i have ever had in my life, my husband is still drooling over his chicken.  I was so very happy i was able to talk to Tony, he completely rebuilt our faith in The Pour Beer Market & Grill and we will be returning for dinner again, in the very near future. :D"}
{"text":"A nice place with a huge variety of beers.  Everyone can find a beer they like here!"}
{"text":"Very pleasing selection of microbrews. Only complaint is that the front of the place makes it look like they're closed. No lights and they have some things leaned up against the inside, front windows."}
{"text":"Update: Tried this place a second time and was equally disappointed.   We asked the waitress what she recommended we eat, since the Stromboli's we tried the first time were so bad. She recommended pizza, said it was a fan favourite but honestly, I don't see why. The three of us each tried a different pizza and it was mediocre at best. The food here is definitely 2 stars.   In my first review I said their beer selection was amazing, and that I would definitely have drinks here again. Well, I take that back. EVERY beer I wanted to try was sold out, I'm talking 4-5 different beers! That's just poor management, I mean come on... the place is called The POUR!  I don't recommend this place AT ALL. Try somewhere else, don't waste your hard earned cash."}
{"text":"I'm a beer geek. The beer menu here is above average for a neighbourhood bar/chain, but there are no standout brews. The food is decent, but nothing standing out means this is just A-Ok."}
{"text":"We have been trying different pubs in the Airdrie area over the past 6 months and this place will certainly be removed from our list. Beer selection was average, food was below average and cocktail selection, despite having a large menu, was pitiful. Ordered an Old Fashioned and was given a glass of bourbon with a cherry and a sugar cube in it. There was even a picture of the drink in the menu as it should be presented. So a glass of bourbon (Bullet) and a sugar cube cost $14 - quite unbelievable.  So, obviously make your own decisions but we will never be going back."}
{"text":"Wow!  Very impressive new pub with a great beer selection, excellent food, a very nice (upscale) ambience, and incredible service from  a bevy of attractive and attentive servers. Think Earl's. I had the pizza and it was just excellent, a small pizza was too much for me, I took half of it home. They have some upscale beers that include free glasses to take home, wing nights (no take out), nice booths and lots of TV's.   Pour has raised the bar for eateries and drinking establishments in Airdrie."}
{"text":"The pizza is from scratch & it tastes it. They have Erdinger Hefe on tap so I'm in love. They weather is finally nice here so the patio is awesome. I just wish it would get dark earlier. It's kinda weird kickin' it when it's so bright out."}
{"text":"I've recently moved to Airdrie so have been slowly trying out some of the local pubs and restaurants.  My husband and I decided to give pour beer market a try and go for drinks and appies. My first impression of this place was less than stellar. First off there was a group of somewhat shady looking men smoking right outside the entrance. After walking through the cloud of smoke we entered the somewhat desolate looking bar. It was a Wednesday evening and mostly empty except for what looked to be a few regulars who stared at us when we came in like we didn't belong there. I also noticed that the layout of the bar was kind of odd without much flow and had a bit of a dirty look to it.  We quickly found a table and the waitress was prompt getting our drinks, though they were all out of the beer that was supposed to be on special. Also for a place called \"pour beer market\" I was underwhelmed with the beer selection. We then decided to take a look at the menu and my appetite was kind of turned off by the dirty menu. We ordered the nachos since there really wasn't much that appealed to us on the menu and nothing really unique. The nachos were your standard pub nachos, nothing to complain about there. We decided against ordering any more beer since we just weren't enjoying the atmosphere and the weird dance music.  All in all I would not return."}
