{"text":"I love what sushi cafe has to offer!  It's very clean and fresh... and decent prices and great quality food"}
{"text":"Delightful! Sushi was fresh and delicious. Price was cheaper than other places in the area and food came out quick. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I love a good sushi! Tried this place for the first time today and it was very good. I ordered the bowl  some pice of sushi it was very fresh tuna with great flavor. The sauce was really good. Excellent taste and spicy level was perfect. Thanjks guys!"}
{"text":"I saw this hidden new spot when I was driving past the shopping complex. The word \"sushi\" always catches my eye. Came back a few hours later to try it out. The owner is friendly and took the time to explain his creative new to-go concept. Anyone who enjoys sushi at home like I do, I recommend stopping by. Prices are amazing!"}
{"text":"Super quick, and delicious! They place the food in a convenient to-go box. It satisfies my sushi cravings"}
{"text":"I'm going with 3 stars, it almost got 4. In terms of value the place is a 5 star. In terms of quality, it's 3. The boxes are really good deals. If you want affordable rolls (all the basics), you'll find them here at an incredibly reasonable price. They also have a decent amount of cooked options. I just wasn't wow'd by anything, and my family got a vast array of stuff to try. So it needs a signature dish, but in terms of value - it's pretty top notch."}
{"text":"What's not to love? Easy, delicious sushi...in a setting where you can SEE your food being prepared! Good selection, great staff, clean restaurant...the cafe is intimate and cozy and I can't wait to go back..."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and clean place but fish was paper thin.  California roll was good my only problem was there was hardly any fish"}
{"text":"tl;dr THE IMO KOROKKE THOUGH. 

Since I left DFW I've been trying to find somewhere to fill the void Sushi Robata left in my soul. Sushi Cafe comes damn close. 

The prices are the best I've seen pretty much ever, I think. The menu isn't huge, but it covers the bases. ALSO IMO KOROKKE. It's so hard to find anywhere that does korokke at all, much less somewhere that does them... better than Robata?! The potatoes are so buttery and smooth, and the panko is done well too. The korokke comes with a mysterious orange sauce here, no idea what it's called. It's like a spicy mayo but with a little more heft to it. 

I got the crunch shrimp tempura roll and the red dragon roll. My only criticism is that the eel sauce on the red dragon roll was a little heavy handed, but not a big deal at all. It did leak over into my tempura roll, but whatever. 

They also have some desserts in a fridge case - matcha cheesecake and castella cake, which is basically a sponge cake. The castella is packaged in two slices of slightly different appearance, and I'm not sure of the difference. There's also some instant ramen bowls available, like Shin Bowl, and the odd matcha Pocky and Hi-Chew sorts of snacks. 

Another reviewer mentioned getting ill after having their order delivered. I noticed at the end of my tempura roll, after it had cooled down a bit, that something did taste a little iffy with the room-temperature tempura combined with the eel sauce. If you're getting delivery (and this applies to any sushi place in my opinion), make sure all the sauces are on the side, and don't get anything meant to be eaten piping hot. The korokke might be okay since potatoes hold heat well, but I'd keep the sushi to the cold-only variations."}
{"text":"Disgusting. I ordered 4 rolls. The spicy salmon has tempura that was completely stale, not crispy and oily. There was oil pools under the roll. As for the salmon avocado rolls, there was a bone in the salmon!! I nearly choked. If it wasn't for the fact that this was take out I would have definitely complained and demanded my money back. As it is this is unsafe food preparation and I'm considering complaining to the city's food inspectors."}
{"text":"My first time going to Sushi Cafe I was welcome with a friendly staff. The cashier guy took his time to explain the menu and recommend me tuna bowl which I enjoyed a lot definitely would be going back."}
{"text":"There was only one other table in the restaurant when we placed our order.  It took over 20 minutes to get the first roll out, then 20 minutes later the next roll came out.  By the time the last two rolls made it to the table (which they forgot), the other 3 people at the table had finished eating.  The sushi rolls tasted ok but they were poorly wrapped.  The iced tea was horrible, don't order it.  The menu is very limited so make sure you check it before coming (if you still come).  I'm not coming back, and don't recommend even for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Got the avocado and eel roll along with two pieces of unagi for takeout.. The unagi was really good and warm. The roll was good as well, but felt it had too much avocado. 3 chunks per piece. Flavor and textures were good. Next time I'd probably try the shrimp/eel/avocado roll."}
{"text":"Very kind and considerate service! And their poke box and green tea cheesecake is awesome too!!"}
{"text":"Fresh, cheap, run by great people, green tea cheesecake. It's a new place and needs to get popular! Everyone should try this place!"}
{"text":"sushi cafe!!!
New concept!
Very affordable and friendly staff!
\"BOX\" menu is my favorite.
Casual place u order and pay first.
Good for the quick meal!"}
{"text":"The food was good but my coworker found a hair fried in to her deep fried roll. If they wore hair nets I'd give them 5 stars."}
{"text":"Been here several times, so nice to have a great sushi place close to home.  I get the spicy tuna on crispy rice every time, it's my favorite!  But, everything we've tried is delicious."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot! Only down side is that it can take awhile to get your food. So if you're in a rush, might not be the best place to go. But, if you have the time, I would definitely come here if you want an affordable sushi lunch. I was so sad for awhile when they were closed =(

I like to get the monster box with a tuna monster roll. It also comes with 5 pieces of nigeri (tuna, salmon, shrimp, yellowtail and white fish). All of that for $10! It's a great deal and the fish is pretty good- not the best but what do you expect for $10?? The monster box used to be better though too.. it used to come with the fried potato which is delicious.. I was a little disappointed to see that not offered with the box anymore, but still a great place and deal for a sushi lunch."}
{"text":"The BEST poke bowl!!!  They never disappoint.  Ordered delivery a few times and I have special requests and they always get it right. Prices are right for what you get. I wish they still had the jalepeno poppers. They were so good!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delish! I'm picky with my sushi but they're fish here tasted fresh and was absolutely delectable! They're friendly and nice and did I mention it's delicious? I'm super full now and may crap my brain out but it was a pleasurable experience."}
{"text":"Unfortunately,  was very disappointed.  Service very slow , no explanation on menu, server couldn't explain anything either. Ordered a,spicy California Roll , it came with no avocado,  asked why server said they make a,spicy crab roll which us the same as California roll...but it wasn't and thsts not what we ordered. Well we ate it anyway , and it was awful ..got check and left will not go back again"}
{"text":"I have ordered from here before, and it was good. Today I ordered delivery and although the food got here rather quickly I was disappointed. The salmon monster rollito had one sliver of salmon in it. It wasn't even a good piece of salmon, it was like the tail end. The tuna monster rollito was 95% surimi. The one thing that was delicious was their chicken teriyaki. If I go back, I will not be ordering the \"monster rollitos.\""}
{"text":"Decided to stop by and give this place a try after reading the good reviews. I must say it's very simple yet the food was very tasty and satisfying. I gave only four stars because the setting inside was very plain and simple. Definitely didn't have the sushi restaurant vibe I'm use to. Not to mention they gave us our sushi in to go containers and that kind of caught us off guard but maybe they thought we were taking it to go, either way we will definitely be back again!!!!"}
{"text":"Bammm!!! Such quick and great quality food! Usually quick and high quality don't go together, but at Sushi Cafe, it's a different story. If you are craving sushi, just stop by and grab fresh and delicious food at sushi cafe! It was my first time visiting.  The staff is very friendly.  I'll definitely go back there with my friends for brunch and my family for a quick lunch or dinner!  Tip:  order first, pay the cashier, then find a seat.  

Pro : it's cheaper than I expected and it is a decent amount of food. It's very Clean!!! They put all the food in the container box so you can just eat and bring the rest home. The menu consist of Popular sushi  and Korean food. Delicious dessert (like green tea cheesecake.) 

Con :  It can be difficult to find. (It's behind auto zone) There is no table service or alcohol."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. I had the special 12 piece spicy roll $14.  Perfect size and price.  Service was friendly and fast. Clean place. Must go for quick sushi"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. My daughter found this place on Yelp and wanted to give it a try. I have to take her word for it because I am allergic to Seafood. 

She was very skeptical at first. She had only tried Sushi once in Virginia. Upon ordering the lady at the counter was very helpful in helping her to make a decision on what she wanted. I explained to her my allergy and she assured me that they have other items on the menu that did not contain seafood.

My daughter absolutely love her California rolls and cannot wait to go back. The prices are amazing it doesn't break the budget. The decor is very nice. This is definitely going to be on the top of our list of places to eat when we are undecided for dinner."}
{"text":"I saw this place on Yelp by total accident, but I'm so happy I stopped by!

It's a smaller sushi establishment that offers good deals on sushi. Though I just ordered salmon rolls, I'll be coming back to try their bento/box combos. The service was great and the food was pretty good. I even got a green tea cheesecake for checking in on Yelp! 

If you haven't yet, give this place a try if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"The sushi, sashimi, and roll all treated fresh and wonderful.  Only been here once but I've enjoyed the meal and the dining experience."}
{"text":"The food was so fresh. Service was lovely and prices were so reasonable. Tuna Poke was amazing!"}
{"text":"Love fresh sushi and this place is great for that. I ordered from home and they was on time. Driver was awesome. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I attend the dojo a couple doors down for this place, and we've been waiting in anticipation since the sign went up! The food here is really good! They're focus is somewhat healthier versions of US sushi. Def not the most traditional food, but quite tasty. The owners/staff were really friendly and took their time explaining their food and concept and went out of their way to be welcoming overall. 

   As I'm not a huge raw-fish fan, I went with the spicy pork bento, an order of gyoza, and an order of edamame (I was in a large group and intended to share some gyoza and edamame). Everything was quite tasty! I really enjoyed the pork, though it could have been spicier, and the rice was really good too! It's a mix of white and brown and topped with furikake. The meal also came with a few pickles, a small seaweed salad, and a gorokke (croquette). Their croquette is again, intended to be lighter, and is mixed with kabocha for a sweeter taste, rather than having a sauce. The gyoza also came without a sauce, but I found on both parts I wasn't quite missing anything. 

   The only kinda of negatives to watch out for, are that this place does all of its plating in to-go boxes. While this is super easy for a quick lunch or post-work out dinner, it may not be the most special date-night, if you're looking for something fancy. Also, the edamame are only lightly salted, not coated in the rock salt in used to. It's still really tasty, just not what I was expecting. Also, they don't have a liquor license, so no after-class beer and edamame at this time, which is probably better for my waist line anyway.

Overall a great little place. It's definitely going to be my new Friday night after-class hangout!"}
{"text":"Dry rice, dry chicken, and dry Hamachi...  One and done... spent $57. The caterpillar roll, salmon roll 4 orders Hamachi, chicken Bento..."}
{"text":"I came just to get avocado rolls. They're super good, fresh, and affordable. I was pleasantly surprised at how nice the service is for such a casual place! It's good for a vegan on a budget ~"}
{"text":"Seriously the BEST Poke bowl in town. I've been to plenty of other places and nothing compares. This place piles on the fish! Menu says it comes with 1/2 proud of fish and it is the TRUTH! I will forever come to this place. The staff is so friendly as well. Always welcoming you. They check on you and ask you how you food is. It's a great place!"}
{"text":"I had read the reviews and true as can be, they were waiting for me with a menu in hand when I walked through the door. I ordered to go and in about 10 minutes I was walking out the door. Fresh and fast not to mention good price. As I'm writing this, I think I'm gonna go back and get another order to go."}
{"text":"I love love love this place!! I have dined here several times and each time the fish is super fresh and delicious! The portions for the rice on the nigiri is perfect and generous. I highly recommend the monster box and poke bowls but honestly I've had several of the rolls and they are equally fantastic! 

You can't beat the service (fast!) and the price!! 
Thanks Sushi Cafe!"}
{"text":"Never disappoint us with fresh ingredients and warm hospitality! Thanks again Sushi Cafe."}
{"text":"Wow this place is amazing .... What a hidden gem .... Customer service was fantastic and food was off the wall good ..... Great job!!!! I will make sure all my friends know about this place."}
{"text":"Great sushi thats inexpensive for the dt core, and excellent customer service as the chef brought me a cup of tea while i was eating, even though this is more of a takeout rather than eat-in spot. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great place for sushi! Delicious rolls! I've gotten a couple to go orders there. Always ready before I get there. Great customer service! Always very friendly when I walk in! Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Great little spot to grab a quick  bite! The plates are yummy and easy on the wallet. They even made a special role for our 5 year old based on what she likes! We had the salmon burrito size role, korean beef plate, dumplings and a side of fried egg which my husband ordered more of!"}
{"text":"Unique, tried something new aside from AYCE. Some AYCE sushi have poor quality but not this one. fish are fresh. Presentation is very nice. Price is reasonable with good portion of fish. Order Came in a box with 4 sushi, 2 sushi type burrito and 2 crispy something with potato inside  (dont know the name) but it tasted good. Just wish theres more fillings in the burrito. 

Most importantly is that they are clean, they used gloves while making the sushi. I hate it when some places use their bare hands who knows where it touched. 

Staff is friendly and helpful.

Like this place and will definitely come back"}
{"text":"We love Sushi Cafe, there prices are so reasonable & their quality is fantastic... The best part is they deliver to our house!
We have ordered from them many times & have never been disappointed. I love their spicy tuna & crispy rice!
We have only eaten at the restaurant once, it was nice, but love their delivery option!

So glad too see that the rest of the neighborhood is enjoying them as much as we are so hopefully they can stay forever :)"}
{"text":"I love this place.. omg the cashier is great. Food is very delicious and great customer service."}
{"text":"Great sushi, for a really great price. The staff is so friendly and they recommend different things based on your order. They have quality fish all day. They are super fast for dine in and take out. Typically I don't get sushi for take out because it either takes to long or it just doesn't taste the same at home. I come here for lunch pretty frequently and usually spend less that $15 for a roll and a couple pieces of nigiri. Definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"Love this place, love this place, love this place. Super affordable sushi. I love their Monster boxes. Lots of food for about $10. I order via Grubhub today and have stopped by and ate via coupon from Radio Shopping show. It's become my go to for good affordable sushi that actually tastes good. I recommend their regular boxes or the monster boxes for a good lunch or dinner sized meal. I would even order this without a coupon by the way and I did."}
{"text":"Excellent food!  Everything we order is presented beautifully and taste is top notch! Sushi is excellent and fresh! Try the spicy edamame, its got its own twist and a new favorite of mine.  We go during the day and its not too busy.  Its a small, quaint restaurant, nice decor and great, friendly staff.  Prices are excellent also.  I give them 5 stars for everything, all the way around!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome for a cheap tasty lunch. All of their sushi rolls are affordable from $5.99 - $7.99 with filling portions as well. I always come here for the Green Dragon roll and Spicy Salmon because of how much they give you. Well worth it. The only thing to watch out for is how busy this place can get during prime time lunch hours. Between 12-1pm there is usually only one guy working cash and making sushi so you might find yourself waiting for about 15-20 minutes for your food. Other than that though, there are only good things to say about this sushi place."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Grub Hub delivers it and it stays good the whole way here. The fish is superb and the sauces are amazing. It is very reasonably priced and it is SO filling. Definitely my new favorite sushi spot in Henderson!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in town. The chicken bento box and Thai ice tea is my staple. Haven't even tried the sushi yet. Highly recommend! I think their name is really basic and generic sounding so it's a hidden gem. Very professional and clean. Not what you expect by just driving by."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have visited many sushi establishments throughout the LV area. We live in Henderson and came across Sushi Cafe. We originally visited because it was close to us, then we sat down and had an awesome experience. Not only is the sushi the BEST in the area, but the staff was great as well. It's clean, the food comes out fast, and was just overall a very pleasant experience. Also, if you live close they will deliver for free. Did I mention the prices are cheaper than most Sushi establishments? MUST VISIT if you want sushi!!!!!"}
{"text":"Their meal boxes are so good. I tried the bbq box and I was blown away. The quality of the food is good to. And you get such variety in the box it's a really good deal. It's actually a very good price considering the amount of food they give and the taste. My new go to food place since it's right next to my house also."}
{"text":"Been here twice now. I've had a good selection of their items. Excellent quality and taste at reasonable price. They have an open kitchen concept so the customers can see how clean the kitchen is!  Entrees are in the bento box tradition, can dine in or easy for take out. Just taste alone, the Korean bbq beef is the best."}
{"text":"Went here Saturday afternoon and I'm so glad I found this little gem. I got the Korean bar b que box ( if I could give this 10,000 stars I would) and a spicey tuna and Philly roll. The service was fast and the food was delivious!!!"}
{"text":"First time I tried this place and it was very delicious the sushi was fresh and the staff was very nice. I had Yellow Tail which melted in my mouth and freshwater eel that was sweet and very tasty. Also had the kiss of dragon which was spicy but very good. They ask you from a scale of 1 to 10 how spicy do you want it I love spicy food and I went with a seven which I think was a little hot next time I will try a 5 or 6 Maybe. Definitely recommend this place to others there is no sushi bar so don't expect to sit there only tables and a couple couches which was still fine I was okay with that."}
{"text":"Sushi Cafe is a brand new restaurant on Stephanie st. In Henderson and is specializing in the quick, casual, Asian style cafe. So far, it's only been open for a couple of days, and after trying it out, it's a decent place to go for a quick meal.

Sushi Cafe is right about next to Henry's American Grill. It's a small little shop, but is bright, clean, and very well maintained. It has a modern feel. After being explained the concept, I was intrigued.

This place is going for the fast, casual eatery. They are going for various boxes which include meats, seafood, and other items. They are also going for a different style of food where they are pairing some Asian ingredients with panini's. You can also order nigiri and sushi rolls by themselves. I ordered a monster box, which included a roll, and 4pcs of nigiri.

I ordered the Korean BBQ roll box which came with 4pcs of nigiri. I thought it was alright. Nothing stood out in bad way. It was a quick casual meal and how I thought would be expected. It was a decent meal.

Originally, I was going to give the food here 3.5 stars, but I rounded up with the really great service and value for what I received. Definitely different when it comes to their contemporaries like Zupas and Panera, but different in a good way."}
{"text":"Great local sushi restaurant! First time we tried this place. The sushi rolls were fresh and delicious. We will definitely be ordering again."}
{"text":"I was recommended this place from a friend because they told me they had sushi burritos. I came in for lunch to give it a try! It's tucked in a plaza so you have to look carefully while driving around the parking lot. 

Upon entering, to the left was a huge chalkboard that listed their box specials, and the cashier gave us a paper menu to look at. 

I decided to go with the Salmon burrito box special. I am pretty picky about what I like and don't like to eat, and I specified that I would like to have half salmon and half tuna, with crab mix, spicy mayo, and eel sauce. She told me that all of that would be added in there. However, when I received my burrito there wasn't any crab mix. 

The reason I am giving it 4 stars is because the food is actually pretty good for what you're paying. For $10, I got a sushi burrito (it's probably the size of 3 eggrolls), and 5 pieces of sashimi and 2 gyoza. At first I thought it was an okay deal, but it turned out to be more than filling!

Knocking off one star for customer service because it took us over 20 minutes to get our food (most likely because of deep frying the gyoza), and the lack of explanation of the menu. But overall I would come back here for lunch when I am craving sushi. I'll just remember to call it in"}
{"text":"We tried twice to try this place out a couple weeks ago but they were closed. Due to the great reviews, we remained persistent and third time was a charm! We arrived close to their posted closing time and they welcomed us, even allowed other diners after us too. This is not AYCE but I had my eye on a Monster Box and our hungry boys wanted to order a few rolls. The nice gentleman who took our order suggested we order from their party menu for more variety: a speciality roll, sushi, various sashimi. The quality of their fish was excellent esp for the price. For the 4 of us, our bill was under $45 and we left satisfied. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is spot on for friendliness and yummiest. We'll be back tomorrow after our softball game."}
{"text":"So good! I got their Bulgogi Monster Box and it was delicious. I'm not entirely sure what all the stuff in my box was (lol) but it ate it all! Service was also good, one of the guys took the time to walk me through the menu and help me decide what I wanted."}
{"text":"I like this place! We ordered \"box\" with fried cod for my daughter it was good quality and let me say I fell in love with their fried potato that came with it, and I ordered some more for the road. Then I got a lemon roll which is surprisingly delish! My husband got the jackpot roll and I'm gonna say i liked it a lot. We ordered the mix poke and seaweed salad which are pretty fresh and they make it by order. Overall I like the casual vibe and the not overwhelming menu and price. I recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place is the definition of a hidden gem, we honestly would've never seen it if we didn't stay in the same building.  We came here with a group of 5 around 7pm because we were hungry and needed something close.  We got 10 various rolls.  They were all handmade to order(including fried stuff) so it took a bit of time but it was  definitely worth it.  The value here is insane, I've never had a better deal on sushi before.  Everyone agreed that the sushi tasted fresh and was delicious.  We actually ended up coming here several more times throughout the weekend."}
{"text":"Sadly after visiting for the past several months, I will no longer be back. The food quality has really taken a tumble(fish is not fresh, borderline frozen/dried out when served), ordered a tempura roll and was served a lightly cooked roll which was mushy and not really edible, no music, soda machine no longer works, the waitress is fairly nice but she is not hygenic - both this visit and prior one I've seen her cough on her hands or without covering her mouth and also prep side dishes without gloves on or washing hands after touching money - very disgusting."}
{"text":"A delightful little lunch spot! Fun Asian box lunches and various sushi rolls in a fast-casual atmosphere. The food is fresh and fairly light, and I especially like how the rice is a white-brown combination.

The White Fish box was plenty of food for one, with two planks of fried fish on a bed of cabbage, with the rice and sides of seaweed salad, pickled veggies, tamago and some sort of sweet potato croquette? I liked everything enough to grab a takeout lemon roll for my guy, who inhaled it and assured me the fish was fresh.

Good addition to the area, focusing on fast lunch should make them a hit with the nearby office parks or for those visiting the nearby DMV. Props for giving this area another healthy option!"}
{"text":"Such great sushi and service! Kay is so sweet! My wife and I drive pretty far just to eat here. Amazing place!"}
{"text":"Found this \"cafe\" on yelp, and so we stopped in! Sushi was incredible, staff was extremely attentive and accommodating, and the cafe is clean and very welcoming. Sushi was absolutely fantastic- we will definitely be coming back!!"}
{"text":"This place is one of the greatest values I've found in my area.  The sushi is not super fantastic but it's definitely doable, especially for the price.   They have these \"monster boxes\" that come with two pieces of fried gyoza, 5 pieces Of nigiri and then a giant roll that's like a sushi burrito.   For $10!!!!!   It's not to be passed if you are a sushi fan."}
{"text":"Super delicious! I ordered the Bento Box with Tempura... Wowsers havent tasted that light crispy tempura batter in ages. Very very very good. Highly recommend. I also ordered the spicy tuna roll which was great too."}
{"text":"Great little sushi spot. Fast and easy and good! It's counter service so you walk up an order and grab yummy drinks from their fridge, or a make-it-yourself ramen bowl. Tuna poki was great as was the lemon roll. My son loves the bulgogi and ramen."}
{"text":"Spicy salmon roll contains a teeny bit of salmon and spider roll does not contain real soft crabs.

If you're only looking for cheap rice in a roll, that's great. Otherwise, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Small changes made here recently. They now have transitioned from fast casual (order/pay first) restaurant to actually having table service.  So if you are dining in, wait to be seated.  Also if you are dining in, your orders are served in dinnerware  instead of paper boxes. Little improvements like this are cool and good to see that owners listen to their customers feedback! Since I have seafood allergies, glad that they delicious options! My favorite here still is the Bulgogi box."}
{"text":"I live in Boulder City and my son and I made a special trip just to try Sushi Café out because of the reviews. We were impressed and very glad we made the 30 minute drive over. We had the Screaming O special, Spider Roll, Caterpillar, and Salmon Nigiri. The Sushi came quickly. Tasted so fresh. Great customer service. Very clean and relaxed atmosphere. We will definitely be coming back. For fresh sushi in the desert you should come here. The price is reasonable to boot."}
{"text":"Sushi was fresh, delicious, and wonderfully priced. Staff was quite friendly, too. Definitely have a new favorite sushi spot:))
Ps try the lemon roll, it's amazing!!"}
{"text":"This place is great! The sushi is fresh and taste super yummy! I definitely recommend"}
{"text":"I am afraid to share a review because I want to keep this gem to ourselves, but it is too good not to share. AMAZING sushi, AMAZING prices and AMAZING staff. By far the best Easter dinner ever."}
{"text":"Been there about 6 times already. The guys are very friendly and know their menu. Loved the poke appetizer. 
Now to serious business. The deep fried potato thingy is so crunchy and delicious! Yesterday i took my mom there. She had a box and really liked it. I had for the first time a tuna bowl. This is seriously the BEST tuna bowl ever. No joke. I felt it was very spicy. But itms me, i cant handle spicy. But it didnt matter i ate it all. It was huge. This guys don't disappoint. Everything i had so far has been excellent! The other day i had one meal that was like a burrito and it was delicious. 
One thing i love is that is very casual. 
My girls love the little panda bear cookies"}
{"text":"Places like these are why I signed up for Yelp in the first place.

As I write this review, I'm hesitant in a greedy way. I know as more attention is brought to places like these, prices will go up, but I feel responsible as a proper foodie and passionate lover of food that I must do what I can to help this restaurant succeed. I will sacrifice my ever loving greed to keep this place a hidden gem, and hopefully help this place make more restaurants closer to me!

Ok enough with the gross poetry. On to the real review:

Background: coming off a HORRENDOUS sushi experience near my house, I felt a gaping hole in my stomach with the need for good sushi redemption. Looked this place up, saw its prices and thought: welll if its just like Mac's Sushi in malls...not bad. 

Never expected something like this...MY GOD this place has the best Spicy Salmon roll for its price point. Legit. Real deal. #yesitsactuallyspicy! 

I can't tell you how many times I've ordered a simple spicy salmon roll at more expensive places...and have gotten just a tempura overload or too thicc salmon chunks.  The rice to filling ratio perfect! did I mention its ACTUALLY SPICY?!

The owner is very modest, kind, and welcoming. I live in North York and I'll find excuses to come down here to eat regularly. It's worth the extremely unreliable ttc rides, and busy people of dtown just to get there!"}
{"text":"One of the best sushi values you'll find! The service was excellent, food great and all for a price that'll keep us coming back. Awesome spot for sure!"}
{"text":"I got the spicy pork box and it was great. Good value for the money spent. Gf got the poke bowl and liked it a lot too."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've eaten sushi all around town and am rather particular. This little spot has become my favorite over the last year or so. Really good sushi, great prices and amazing staff. My toddler runs in the door looking for her favorite server. I would highly recommend Sushi Cafe. They treat you like family and have really good, fresh fish."}
{"text":"Came to Sushi Cafe again with the sister from San Diego and good friend. Even after the second time around, this place's food did not disappoint. Our hostess, Nuri was not working but the other lovely hostess gave is stellar service as well. 
My sister cannot stop raving about Sushi Cafe and nor can I. This is fast becoming my go-to place for sushi and Bulgogi cravings and I am glad to have found this place. 
As I've said on my last review, two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Staff is friendly, presentation is great! No name Roll is by far the most amazing roll I've ever had (and I consider myself a sushi snob ). Their Screaming Orgasm sauce is the best screaming o sauce I've ever had. I could drink it. The monster-ritos are very good as well. The spicy tuna one is great. I definitely recommend! The bulgogi is ok. Not the best I've had but it was good, although I wouldn't order it again."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I'll definitely be coming back! You get great, filling amount of food for an awesome price! My family got the rollritos (it's a sushi burrito) and they said it was awesome!! I got the bulgogi box and I was super satisfied. It was already a lot of food for me but the waitress came by and told me it didn't look like a lot to her so she gave me more! I also like how they have traditional Japanese drinks and snacks. Amazing place!!"}
{"text":"Best sushi I think I have ever had! Had the spicy crab roll, California roll and egg rolls- all super fresh. Service was incredibly fast and even though I took it to go, the seating area was clean and aesthetically pleasing. Found this place on Yelp and it did not disappoint. My new favorite sushi place!"}
{"text":"Saturday night and closed at 8:50 PM! Plus the tempura sauce tastes weird. Other than that, food is not bad for my first experience. They just need to stay open later."}
{"text":"This was my go to spot, but over the last several months, they have done away with their fried potatoes, korean fried chicken, and delivery. Food they have is still good, but their selections are getting smaller. Hope they expand again in the future."}
{"text":"The food at Sushi Cafe is really good and the place is clean and casual. The price is ok. I recommend it to my friends and family."}
{"text":"This place is great. The sushi is fresh and the staff is friendly. I highly recommend the screaming \"o\" roll! I'll definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Absolutely five stars.  First time here, right at happy hour.  Ambience is quaint, quiet and chill.  Service was very attentive and best quality. My server was Shizuka and if you get her you are lucky.  She knows her stuff!  The price range was perfect--not expensive and perfect portion sizes.  The food itself was worth the five stars alone.  The fried rice was light and full of flavor, and at the same time was not too oily.  The gyoza was cooked the right way and made on site, which was easy to tell by the balance of sight, texture and flavor. Hands down the best gyoza I've had at a restaurant in Vegas.  
Food was hot and fresh and beer was nice and cold.  I anticipate trying the ramen next time; I just did not have that much of an appetite today.  
I will be returning here from now on.  Perfect spot for a lunch or happy hour break!!"}
{"text":"This place is lit! So cheap and so good. Highly recommend! My chick and I ordered 5 different rolls and the total was $30. So much, she couldn't finish her food. And they made it fresh!"}
{"text":"The service was great. My friends and I got an assortment of different rolls and they were all just ok. Really slow considering it was peak dinner hours. Restaurant was clean and comfortable. The menu was small and nothing stood out to make this place different. I also found the food to be mediocre. I've had better sushi in town and I've had worse sushi in town. I'll go back at some point, because I can walk there from my apartment. That being said I wouldn't go out of my way to drive here for sushi. If you're stuck at the DMV or in the area definitely a good place to grab a bite though."}
{"text":"Inexpensive but great service, atmosphere, and flavor. Rolls are also large so pricing is seriously impressive."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!!! Omg you have to try their spicy pork box, Bulgogi box, Miso soup, spicy tuna rice crackers, their shrimp tempura and the tempura sauce its to die for.  You definitely have to come and try this place. Great flavor and you will not regret it! 110% loved it"}
{"text":"Super yummy and friendly! Just got some simple rolls to try it out and they were delish. My son loved the miso soup. We do aikido a few doors down and this place will make a great stop for a snack or meal before or after class. My cucumber salad was made fresh and i wasnt expecting anything out of the ordinary but i couldnt stop eating it. I cant wait to try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here for a few months, and was very disappointed. It seems like they have new owners. We used to get the monster box which would have sushi burrito a few pieces of California roll and some tempura, this time for that price we got was the sushi burrito and it only had one shrimp tempura inside. We will not go back again."}
{"text":"this place has good sushi, my only problem with this place is that it takes too long to place your order and to receive your order.
if you are in a rush this is not the place. 
took us over 1 hour from seating to paying for sashimi and 2 classic rolls.
FYI, they have vegan and vegetarian options that are not on the menu, but just ask."}
{"text":"Definitely coming back!!! The place is extremely clean, the food is amazing and the price is right! We had Philadelphia deep fried rolls, is just delicious! The fish taste very fresh... Can't wait to try others things from here."}
{"text":"I love their poke box! :) also the goroke that comes with it :) very nice staff as well."}
{"text":"I started coming here when they first opened and it was one of my favorite spots! Definitely would have given this place 5 stars before. Unfortunately, a lot has changed since they first opened. 

They got rid of some of my favorite menu items. When we asked why they no longer have it the server said it was simply because they could not afford it anymore. Quite sad because this place was an awesome sushi spot that served lunch boxes! The Korean bbq box was my personal favorite. Their lunch boxes comes with your choice of meat, seaweed salad, (2) potstickers, tamago, and rice.

We recently visited again and ordered the bulgogi box and a couple of sushi rolls. I got the spicy rainbow roll and it seems that the quality of fish is not as good anymore. 

The service is friendly and they redecorated the interior of the cafe but I would probably only return for the bulgogi box!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff who answered our questions thoroughly.  Had the Spider Roll ($7.95 for 5 pieces) and Uni Sushi Nigiri ($6.95 for 2 pieces) for lunch.  Enough to hit the spot.  The rice for the Spider Roll was warm, so that threw me off a little, but overall, clean locale, fresh ingredients, and clean presentation.  Took a panoramic shot of the inside since there were only the two of us there, but my pics of the rolls and the Shrimp Lunch Box that my friend ordered got deleted on accident."}
{"text":"I am forever craving sushi and decided to check out Sushi Cafe. I was immediately greeted and felted welcome. I love the concept of quick service. Prices are reasonable and the sushi was yummy! Can't wait to go back for more!"}
{"text":"I would give 5 stars but customer service to place a phone order is extremely poor.  The lady who takes phone orders couldn't understand anything I said and then accused me of calling in earlier and trying to order a tuna poke bowl?? I was asking for a salmon burrito or rollito as we had just been in a few days ago to get a spicy tuna and shrimp tempura burrito (as the lady called it) and they were both great.  Really disappointing.  Please put someone on the phone who can answer questions and provide a great experience so I'll want to come back again and again.  Won't be placing any more phone orders unfortunately.  Also wish the website was updated and loaded pictures."}
{"text":"Great value and very friendly staff.  Cute interior and very relaxing environment.  I love their crispy shrimp sushi burrito. I will come back!"}
{"text":"This place is amazeballs. Ordered delivery two nights in a row, that's how good it is. Now, I know the place is called Sushi Cafe, but I ordered it for the Korean nom-noms. I LOVE Korean food and this place has some really good Korean-style meats that you can get delivered which is awesome. There's no other place for this kind of food around here that delivers (I'm looking at YOU Jun's!). I had the fried philly-roll and it was good, but not really what I was excited about anyway. i really love dwaeji bulgogi so when I saw the spicy pork box, I knew I would like it and I did. It was le-noms.
Another thing that they have that's really good is the Korean style fried chicken. Of you are a fan of Korean fried chicken places like Kyochon, you should def try the fried chicken here. It's tasty! I highly recommend this place especially if you want Korean food without leaving the house!"}
{"text":"Fish was good quality, not A++, but at least A- (and that is after a 10-15 minute car ride in the Las Vegas summer). Delivery was fast and friendly. Great deal that delivery is free with $30 minimum order. You can get quite a bit for your money, tip your driver, and still come in under $40. I mostly order sushi, so the experience might be different for someone who prefers elaborate rolls or hot food. For my preferences, it is fast and the right price at a level of quality I find more than acceptable."}
{"text":"Tasty, authentic, and nice people. Good prices, too! I was impressed with the cleanliness as food is prepared. Husband got the bulgogi box and he enjoyed it a lot. I got all tempura rolls, like white peoples do lol jk"}
{"text":"I have been here a handful of times now. This is a very casual sushi place, with clean and simple decor. 
While I have never actually tasted the fish, I have had their veggie rolls and custom vegan rolls they make for me. Those have all been delicious! 
Also, the price is really fair, sometimes when you customize an order it can be up charged quite a bit. That is not the case here at sushi Café, as they charge me about five dollars for a custom vegan sushi roll. 
I've had the edamame a few times as well, & it always comes out warm and with a good amount of salt on it. Yum!
Their tea is also good. 
I like the way the seating is with the couches in the front for a relaxed ambiance. This is a very casual place so don't expect it to be trendy or high-end overpriced sushi. 
If you'd like a quick food stop with quick service and reasonable prices, then you should definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"The prices here are pretty good for sushi but the rolls had more rice than anything else and it didn't have much flavor.
But very nice staff and fast service."}
{"text":"Really love Sushi Cafe! Extremely quick and nice service, good sushi and big portions for an awesome price. The lemon roll is my fav. Just recently tried the tuna monster box and tuna tataki sushi and both were delicious! The tuna monster box is an incredible deal and worth the $10. The tuna monster roll (aka huge hand wrap/sushi burrito) had a generous portion of tuna in it which tasted really good. Definitely recommend sushi cafe for a quick sushi craving fix!"}
{"text":"Sushi Cafe is my absolute favorite restaurant in Henderson! I always get the combination poke bowl, where you get a hefty amount of fresh fish with a plethora of other sides in the bowl. I come here about once a week. They have recently renovated the tables and seating, with comfy couches and larger group seating. My only gripe is that the restaurant used to be a order-at-cashier spot, and now its more of a formal sit-down environment. However, we usually place our orders over the phone on the way there. Make sure to call beforehand!"}
{"text":"Cool little place right by my house that I happened upon.  Pretty small inside but the food is pretty great.  Not the best sushi I've had but I would definitely go back as it was tasty and relatively cheap!  No AYCE unfortunately and the menu is a little small but that's good because it cuts down on all of the clutter and you would hope they do what they have well.  It wasn't crowded too and we went just a little after dinner time!  Service was really good as well!"}
{"text":"Realky nice dinner tonight. The staff are friendly and the fiod was fresh and inexpensive.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"It's a great spot. The open space shows the cleanliness, and the staffs are super nice too!!!!. Plus the food is so bomb!!!!"}
{"text":"Although you'll probably end up with something that's okay to eat, it's become basically impossible to know beforehand what you are ordering.

We stopped by for dinner on a Monday evening. There was no one else there, so we were seated immediately.

We'd been here before, but it seems many things have changed.

Their menu is basically useless. There are no descriptions at all about what is in the dishes/rolls. And, unfortunately, our server's mastery of English was not good enough to explain what was in the food. They've also listed some roll names on their chalkboards, but again, no explanation of what they are and no prices.

Ultimately, our food was just okay. There are other restaurants nearby with equal or better quality food where you know exactly what you are ordering. Unless they fix this critical problem I think Sushi Cafe might be in for tough times ahead."}
{"text":"I had worked by St. Andrew station for 10 years+ and never noticed this gem. It actually has a coffee cup neon light as seen from the outside and you might most likely miss it. 
They have fulfilling options for around $6 which are great tasting such as the combo A,B,C which are mix of rice, meat, slaw, veggies. And they also serve sushi sets from all sorts along with things like seaweed salads. A very good find!"}
{"text":"Worked downtown for about ten years and never once heard someone talk about this place. Found it on Yelp and since it's only 5 minutes away from my office, why not give it a try. Had the black dragon roll (eel on top of tempura shrimp roll) for $7.99:

GOOD:
Affordable price, sushi roll made to order (Not available between rush hour of 12pm-1:30pm I think), friendly services, fresh ingredient
OK:
decent portion size
BAD:
The rice weren't cooked well. Wasn't soggy, but like a paste, can't really feel the texture of each individual rice (Didn't affect the taste too much though, maybe because I was there at the end of the lunch hour)

Overall is a good lunch choice, would definitely come back again, so glad to find another place to eat for lunch at work!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try something new, and it was a success! We got 3 Monster Boxes: 1 Shrimp Tempura and 2 Spicy Tuna and also a Tempura Box. Also got the lemon roll which was fantastic. Everything was delicious and not very pricy. It was definitely more than enough food (good thing) and very enjoyable. Right as we walked in we were greeted by the owner/manager, (not sure) and he explained everything on the menu since it was our first time. Overall, it was a great find. Unfortunately, there weren't many people and business is a bit slow, so hopefully it speeds up soon!"}
{"text":"Very Friendly staff and nice atmosphere. The menu was pretty basic and not overwhelming. The prices are very... very reasonable. Ordered a spider roll and three orders of California rolls for about $21 and change. Kids LOVED the California rolls and the spider roll was pretty good too. Can't go wrong here. Will definitely come back again and try more things on the menu. I am glad I found Sushi Cafe"}
{"text":"I came here with my 3 teenage kids and we had 2 orders of shrimp tempura and edamame for appetizers and wow. They are amazing. For our rolls we all shared and had to order more. I wish I had taken pictures. It we ate everything so quick. We had a spider roll, Philadelphia roll, caterpillar roll, and tempura spicy tuna roll. Then we order another tempura roll and a shrimp tempura roll. All were amazing. Service is impeccable. We are stuffed and happy. We will be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"That Umbrella Guy @ Sushi Cafe.

I've heard of this place before but never actually tried it. This place would be difficult to find if they didn't have a big sign out front.

Walking in, it's a really small place. And I mean, literally, 8 people standing around would probably fill it up. They have some stools facing the window, so you could choose to eat there if you want. It's a great view of University Ave.

I ordered a large lunch combo special for $5.99, which comes with rice, meat balls, chicken leg/thigh, and salad. The salad comes with broccoli and carrots, potato, sweet potato, beans and chickpeas, and coleslaw.

The box is hit-or-miss. I really enjoyed the chicken and the rice. The chicken was extremely tender and juicy, and the seasoning they add to it gave it great flavour. The rice was also moist with a hint of ginger. There are some \"meat balls\" which just look like chunks of chicken, but I'm not going to complain about naming.

The salad, on the other hand, was a bit strange. It was really sour, like they added way too much vinegar or something. The broccoli and carrots were also on the raw side (I'm not a fan of raw vegetables), and combined with the sour flavour it was a bit strange. Chickpeas and beans were also a bit sour. I wonder if it's something they added afterwards and whether I can have the sourness not included.

Looking at their menu, they have $4 wraps and sandwiches. I wonder if there's an option where I can just have more of that meat.

This is definitely one of the cheaper options in the financial district. If you're looking for a budget meal, I'd try this place."}
{"text":"I'm hardly ever on this side of town (Henderson), so I really had no clue on what grub was yay or nay for the area. My brother suggested this place, as I said I was craving some seafood. It's a cute little spot located in a not too busy shopping plaza. Walking in, my sis and I thought you walk up to the counter to order, so we sat our stuff down at a table. The gal working the counter quickly approached us with menus and said she would be right with us. She was helping some people standing by the counter (they were reading the wall menus). We ordered a beef bulgogi box which came with rice, seaweed salad, tamago and pickled veg. Also with our order was a miso soup, tuna poke and poke bowl (half ahi and half white fish). I felt like the bulgogi was a little on the dry side and wasn't as flavorful as other bulgogi dishes I've had in the past. I believe the tuna poke, for the price, was lacking in amount. The quality of the fish was excellent! The miso soup was basic and satisfying and the poke bowl was huuuuuuge. Yummy and HUGE. Just a heads up, the poke bowl came with a set variation of toppings and sauce. I'm sure it could be customizable, but I didn't bother to ask. I didn't mind, everything about that poke bowl was perfection! PS, skip the edamame."}
{"text":"I go to school around the area so I've been going to this place 1-2 times a week.. I always to-go the poki bowl. The options are salmon, tuna, white fish, or combo of all. It's ~$14 with tax. I always get the sauce on the side because it gets to salty with the spicy mayo added in. The portion is huuge. They also have FREE delivery within the 3 mile radius on orders over $30."}
{"text":"This was a perfect lunch spot! Ordered their monster box and didn't know that the sushi roll came out like a sushi burrito! It also included 5 pieces of nigiri and 2 pieces of gyoza all for $10. Service was great and food was fresh and delicious. Definitely new favorite spot"}
{"text":"We just left this place and it's an awesome concept! Interior is nice, bright and clean. Way different than the other places before which is a good thing! We received our food super fast which usually affects quality BUT this place proved that wrong! Quality was great and the sushi was fresh. Service is amazing, which always brings us back to places. The owners/sushi chefs were also friendly, funny, and talked to us about their menu and concept! We can tell these guys are dedicated and this will be a new place to grab a quick, quality piece of sushi when we're hungry!!!!!! Awesome jobs guys!!!! 

Ps. We expect the flower every time we eat here now ;)"}
{"text":"Sushi cafe offers delicious bowls, sushi and rolls.  The staff there are very nice.  The only complaint I have is half of the time they are close during their trading hours.   I tried calling them in several of occasion to place an order and they never answer their phone. It's been a very inconvenience for us making trip to the restaurant to find out they are close.  I would give them a five star if they operate accordingly."}
{"text":"Found a new hidden gem for sushi lunch on-the-go! I passed by this hidden mum and pop shop, it's a tiny takeout counter ran by a nice Asian couple. I didn't understand why this place had 5 stars on Yelp so I decided to come try for myself. The menu is very simple, only a number of rolls which are made fresh - I got a red dragon roll for $5.99, which is unbelievable. So for that price, this place is definitely worth a 5-star rating compared to all the on-the-go sushi counters. Sushi Cafe is perfect for a quick lunch takeout (let's not expect a la carte quality for $5.99 okay?), that being said, the rolls are fresh and tasty, totally exceeded my expectation. Will definitely come back again!!"}
{"text":"Excellent. Impressed and surprised. Will be coming back soon. Place is a bit small, unassuming and hidden, the food and price.... Fantastic."}
{"text":"We are in town for the weekend, and went on another Yelp review. Fresh and excellent! Great protein box. Delicious sushi. Must try!"}
{"text":"On first glance this place seems pretty insignificant because it's in the corner but don't let that discourage you. This food is delicious and really fresh. Checked in and got complimentary kurroke with my bulgogi box. I'll be coming back in the future."}
{"text":"This place is probably one of the best sushi places in town. Order the box and the monster box. Both are delicious. The sushi is at a relatively good price too. Good place for good quality sushi."}
{"text":"This was just meh for me. I had a tempura be to box. He tempura itself was good but the add one were... Meh. I also ordered a tuna roll, which wasn't bad but didn't leave me wanting more."}
{"text":"Woot woot, a sushi spot literally down the street from my house! 


I ate here two times, the first time I had the bbq Korean box and a shrimp tempura roll. The first time I ordered a Korean BBQ bento box and it was good, the meat was very tender and had  great sauce . The second time the meat was inedible, their was no sauce and the meat quality was downright horrible. I like to give everyone a chance but this place is going to have to step up if they are going to make it in this transit town. Their menu needs to be more descriptive. I didn't dare order something I had no idea of what it was. Their are too many sushi spots in town to have low quality sushi. The prices are good because your not getting the top quality, I would compare their sushi rolls to supermarkets like Smiths/Albertsons. You need to be consistent to stay in business as a new business, 

Their are plenty of sushi spots in the Valley but most are average. I hope this place gets their act together as far as their quality in meat goes or else they won't make it out here :/"}
{"text":"My new favorite sushi place. The price is great. The service is amazing. All around a great place. !!!"}
{"text":"As others have stated, Sushi Cafe is extremely clean and very fast with getting orders ready.  I walked in, looked at menu then ordered.  This was the longest part of the process - choosing what to get.  Once I ordered and paid for the spicy tuna roll, california roll and bulgogi box it was five minutes or less before my order was ready.

I took the sushi back to the hotel where my son and husband devoured it.  The review of the spicy tuna was that it was delicious and actually spicy.  (Too many times at other places 'spicy' tuna rolls are anything but spicy.)  The california roll was devoured without a word - so that's a plus, because it was a very picky eater eating it.

My only negative is that I had some fatty meat in the bulgogi box.  Granted, bulgogi will have fatty pieces, but there was one piece that I actually couldn't eat.  It wasn't bad enough to drop the star rating down to four, but thought I'd mention it. 

Overall, everything was delicious, fresh and ready fast!  When a restaurant is as clean as Sushi Cafe, it gives a person confidence that the food prep area is kept clean.

If I'm ever in the area again, I will definitely come back again.

*Side note* For a taste of something unique, try the Korean Nongshim (brand) shrimp crackers in the front.  These are hugely popular in Korea.  For me, I think they're nasty, but I don't like shrimp. ;)  (They're actually like chips and not crackers in the US traditional sense.)"}
{"text":"A must try place and for the price you shouldn't have any excuse not to try it. The food was delicious! Try it....go on try it."}
{"text":"Excellent pick for casual sushi! We've gotten delivery and take-out a few times and it hits the spot. My new favorite is the lemon roll (I did pick the lemon slices off, but you could still taste it). They are a little farther away and not as fancy as our usual place, but...I can see us ordering from Sushi Cafe more often."}
{"text":"Awesome little while in the wall. Only has salmon but it's super fresh, high quality and cheap. The owner is the chef so you get great service."}
{"text":"super nice people and food is cheap and fresh, great spot to get sushi for lunch :)"}
{"text":"Their bathroom is soo gross. They only have one toilet and no one in my family could use it the whole hour we were there."}
{"text":"Spot on! One thing you can't fake on sushi is quality and freshness. Didn't take long to figure out these guys knock it out of the park on both. I had tiger roll, deep fried philly and some sushi - eel, salmon w/ lemon, yellowtail, and super white tuna. Good prices too. 

Sushi Cafe just replaced my go to sushi restaurant. Fantastic."}
{"text":"I 10/10 would recommend!! Great customer service awesome choices for your sushi needs and great boba teas! This is a great place to come with friends or family and just enjoy yourselves the prices are also amazing!"}
{"text":"I love when I walk in and can see them cooking/preparing food.  I really love and will only eat at places that are clean.  Sushi cafe is clean, delicious, friendly, had a comfortable atmosphere and are quick.  Price was reasonable and we were full.  Definitely recommend and encourage you to give it a try.  They also carry specialty snacks and drinks.  Too bad they don't have a location choose to my house otherwise if be there at least 2 times a week!! Thanks you guys, it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Great place to get fresh sushi and other box lunch/dinners. Very tasty!  They're located behind Auto Zone so don't miss them!"}
{"text":"I've ordered Poke Bowls for delivery via Grub Hub, as the location is close to my work. AMAZING! The tuna poke bowl is full of goodies-avocado, seaweed salad, crab salad, rice, etc. The bowl is heaping full and I usually have to eat it in intervals throughout the day. Fast delivery and reasonable pricing. Got my coworkers addicted and now they're stalking the restaurant every day, even moreso now that they're 'closed' due to electrical problems. We really hope this  place opens again!"}
{"text":"I would have taken a pic but it was gone too fast! I had the spicy tuna with crispy rice and the crunchy tempura roll both were so good! The spicy tuna was extra spicy...yum! Super clean and quick...I had no idea this place was so close I'll definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, prices AND amazing service!! I've been here enough times to say this! The fish is always fresh and the service impecable! 5 stars!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, we come in an hour before they closed and we got lucky....no line, no wait. We had the Monster Box of Spicy Tuna, and it is really spicy! Very friendly, clean, and fresh. 1st time here, we are visiting from Texas, can't wait to eat here again. The Monster Box contains a lot of food, for $10 is a steal!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch before an appointment nearby.   I had seen friends pictures of these amazing lunch boxes and wanted to try one.  I got a little confused between the menu on the wall and the paper menu at the register.  I wasn't sure what to order.  I went with the shrimp tempura box and was surprised that it was a sushi burrito.  I love sushi burritos so no problem there.  Food took quite awhile to come out so I ended up eating it after my appointment.  It was still good but I think it would have been even better if I ate it right away.  Next time I will make sure to give myself more time."}
{"text":"Love this place! the food is always fresh, and i love the convenient monster boxes."}
{"text":"Fantastic \"hole-in-the-wall\" sushi restaurant. Very reasonably priced and the sushi is delicious with big portions (try the OMG roll, it's amazing!). Small place but not cramped. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This review is solely based on how this establishment handled my dissatisfaction. There's something to be said about accountability. All businesses are subjected to human error it's about how it's handled. They listened well and accommodated me. The first woman I encountered was extremely friendly and smiling and so was the second one. The cooks were smiling they handled the situation very gracefully and professionally. Thank you"}
{"text":"We went for lunch! All the sushi rolls were fresh and tasty. Staff was efficient. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Very kind, delicious sushi, and CHEAP! 

Ordered tons of food, and the total came out to $22! And the portions were huge. Definitely worthwhile. 

Not busy during lunch time, so if you want great food quick, come here!"}
{"text":"Really liked this place & was becoming a regular. Until I had the same issue 3 times. I always ask for soy wrapper & not seaweed, on rolls. Unless the main cashier ( I think the owner) is taking the order, I don't get the soy paper. Once,  I'd understand but both of the next  times I called in a to go order, I reminded them to make sure, due to the error. 3 times a $12 lunch, which I don't mind, but I need to be able to eat it. I hate seaweed & it ruined my lunch. When I told the regular manager/cashier my next time in, he says \"oh, that's too bad\". Yeah, too bad for you because you lost a customer."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!! Been a good handful of times.. So small and quaint.. service is friendly and fast!! I've ordered some rolls and they were very tasteeeee!! The poke salad is huge and very fresh.. I tear into my food before I can take pictures lol I will upload next time.."}
{"text":"I love this place! Very nice people running the cafe and the food is always good. 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"Ordered from here a few times and have not been disappointed. Always leery of ordering sushi for delivery but reviews were good so thought I'd try it. So much food! Especially if you order a monster box! The lemon roll was amazing! Hubby loves the Bulgogi box, really tender and flavorful. My new go to when I want sushi but am feeling too lazy to go out. Try this place!"}
{"text":"Great service, GREAT prices, GOOD food. This is a hidden gem.  The dining room is small but cute.  There was no wait on a Wednesday at 5pm for 2 and the bill was  $34 (4 rolls, edemame, cucumber salad,  one iced tea), we kind of overdid it ordering too  many rolls since it was our first time and the prices are so reasonable.  The Jack Pot roll was my favorite and the spicy tuna was really good.  I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"We're so glad this is new to the area! 
We've been waiting for a neighborhood sushi bar and this place is so good! 
Sushi is fresh and delicious! 
And the service is amazing."}
{"text":"This place has great food with a friendly atmosphere.  S.E., Jake, and Eugene who run the place are super friendly and will help you through the menu as you decide want you want to eat.

I had a Bulgogi Monster Box and it was DELICIOUS!  A roll, 6 pieces nigiri (including a piece of Tomago that I hadn't tried before and it was good!), seaweed salad, and this awesome fried goroke (?).  Whatever it was, it was good... All for $10!  A great value!

Go check this place out and say Hi to the guys!  If you want great sushi at very affordable prices, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Love it here, casual no muss no fuss. Vibe is totally alive. Korean and Japanese fusion. Fast and efficient. Relaxing place to kick back or hang out. Portions are plentiful and in good variety selection."}
{"text":"So worth it. The picked diago with jalapeño is something from Sushisamba at 1/4 the cost. So simple and delicious. Had the assorted poki that was quality and not overpowering where one flavor outweighs the other. As a previous reviewer stated, you can actually taste the fish and it is a good grade and not cut too thick.

Also has the Korean BBQ and Gyoza with my 10 year old. Both were legit! My son had his signature salmon sushi that he has everywhere we go and this one rated high for him.

Look forward to bringing the wife and cousins here. Truely great food that won't break the bank."}
{"text":"This is a great sushi restaurant.  I usually take it to go it only takes 15 minutes and never disappointed.  I've gone about 8 times in two months and always have to get at least one tempura Philadelphia roll.  The flavor is top notch.  The sushi tastes so fresh.  A hidden gem."}
{"text":"Interesting! I was craving Sushi last night but was to lazy to drive far to the usual place, so I ventured near home and tried The Sushi Cafe. I ordered California Rolls because they are pretty safe since I have never eaten here before. Wow!  Best California roll ever! They were huge and everything was so fresh. Just writing this makes me want to stop what I am doing and go there right now. The staff is very Friendly and prices are very reasonable. I totally recommend this place.. VERY VERY GOOD!"}
{"text":"How does one start a weekend in Las Vegas? May I suggest sushi in Henderson?

Last weekend, after arriving in town, I learned my brother was also in Vegas for a friend's wedding. We decided to meet near where he was staying, which is how we all ended up at the Sushi Cafe in Henderson. Naturally, he previewed the restaurant and noticed it had really good reviews. Considering he lives in San Francisco and loves sushi, this was all the convincing I needed.

The Sushi Cafe is in an interesting location in a strip mall, and it's nicely decorated. Right away, our group felt very comfortable in a clean, modern dining room that was nearly half full. Our server was very kind and took the time to answer our questions. I regret that I don't remember her name.

Most of those in our group chose either the Bulgogi or Spicy Pork boxes. My brother took his own road and selected the Dragon Roll and Edamame. Everyone present enjoyed their meals. And my verdict is this: These are the BEST pot stickers I have ever tried, anywhere!

The next time I'm in Vegas, I'm getting off the freeway at the Stephanie Street exit. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Ordered over the phone was told the food would be ready in 25 min. I only ordered 2 shrimp tempura rolls. When I got there it was empty so not sure why I was told it would take so long. The rolls were pretty filling. But I don't like that the sweet sauce was already poured in the bottom. I like to add my sauce as I go because I don't like to over load with the sweetness. Loved the crunchy topping which was optional. Will try again."}
{"text":"I can't get over the fact that they don't charge a delivery fee!! Have to love that. Wonderful sushi, reasonable prices. You have to try this place, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Passed thru Vegas on vacation & yelped for a sushi restaurant. Def got lucky this place is awesome!  $11 for a spicy crab roll and a crunchy California roll."}
{"text":"This sushi is TERRIBLE. The rice is soggy and the rolls are not packed tightly at all. The imitation crab meat they use is also sloppy and the ahi was just slapped on top of the Hawaiian roll but overall the presentation was awful. I've never not wanted to post a picture of my sushi, but this was a first. The fried tempura rolls were equally awful and overly thick. The nigiri squid and octopus sushi was still partially frozen when it was served. The best thing about this restaurant was the green tea and that was still served to me in the can with a straw. Bathroom was disgusting and the place just felt filthy overall. Stained seats and tables cluttered with dishes long after patrons had left. I'm from Hawaii and have had sushi in Japan, California, as well as many other states and countries and this place was by far the worst. I was lured here by the solid 4.5 star reviews and am now convinced that the people of Henderson, Nevada will never know or taste good sushi and the quality of service and cleanliness that the Japanese are known for. Never again!"}
{"text":"I would love to give this place 5 stars but...
The rolls and all are really good. My daughter and I would visit here 2-3 times a week. We even stayed loyal during their unfortunate closing and reopening. The superwhite is what brought us here the most. Then the superwhite was suddenly not available. And now I'm told they won't care it any longer. The price is average and the rolls are comparable to other places in the area. Unfortunately the superwhite is the game breaker. We live around the corner from here so we might stop in once a month or so. Sorry but if it's a more expensive fish then charge accordingly. Patrons like myself will happily pay."}
{"text":"I love this place! Been here about 5 times, staff is always very friendly, food is excellent and very affordable. I've recommended it to several of my friends and they all love it.I worry because it always seems empty in there, I hope it doesn't close."}
{"text":"Yeah pretty good stuff and affordable. I liked the cucumber role."}
{"text":"This place is so affordable yet the food is fresh and delicious! And the service is friendly and fast every single time! Definitely one of my favorite places to eat in Henderson."}
{"text":"Love the food, the atmosphere and the service. We came in the evening and it wasn't busy do I can speak on behalf of their busier times but for the time we came after a very long day, we were so glad we chose this place. This was our first time here, got the monster box (1 monster roll and 5 pieces of sushi) and a Philadelphia roll and both were fresh and delicious. Definitely recommend if an all you can eat is way out of your budget but still want great sushi for a great price."}
{"text":"Seems like their menu got cut short. 

I was craving for some sushi burrito and/or Korean fried chicken and since I am on a lunch break and this is the closest place to go I decided to come here. Walked in and went straight to the counter and I was given the menu expecting to order their lunch menu sushiritto and 5 (?) sushi combo. Apparently they no longer have this so I was a little disappointed. I asked if they have the KFC as well but they did not have it. 

I opted to order the bulgogi plate (~$10+) to go thinking that it would be tiny based on other people's photos. Opening it back in the office I was greeted by a cup of rice, seaweed salad, tamago , some dumplings and the bulgogi.

Rice was done well, seaweed was not too dry or salty, but I wish I didn't get the cucumbers under it, the tamago was sweet, but dumplings was alright. The bulgogi though... I've had better. It wasn't badddd per se but it was just...bulgogi. What I usually see people get wrong is that the meat gets really hard and dry but Sushi Cafe didn't have that. The juices also seeps down and kind of mix in with the rice which I have no complaints about. I would suggest less... purple cabbage(?) as it had a very bitter taste to it... but that's just me. Kimchi would be nice toooo!

All in all, I think I loved the seaweed the most. Will definitely need to try out the sushiritto later though."}
{"text":"Not coming back here! There card machine wasn't working and she started swiping my card like a mad woman! She even wanted to say all my credit card information out loud. The card number, expiration date, the CVS code, and my zip code. If you don't protection your customer information then you don't deserve my business."}
{"text":"The sushi is so very fresh and tasty! Loved the green tea cheesecake too. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Clean and excellent service. A great addition to our neighborhood. Did I mention the reasonable prices? Yep. I hope this place sticks around."}
{"text":"Friendly staff: we received a warm welcome when we came in, and the staff helped with describing menu items, and giving recommendations. Diverse menu: The food was prepared and delivered quickly, with a great presentation. Everything in the monster box I ordered was fresh and delicious. I would recommend the Sushi Cafe to anyone looking for a great and reasonably priced meal!"}
{"text":"This is a relatively quick sushi stop that is definitely a step above grabbing something from the supermarket. Tended by Japanese staff. The prices are very reasonable. Everything is made-to-order."}
{"text":"I come to Henderson pretty often for work and had a hankering for sushi so I called in a takeout order. The woman on the phone took my order easily and said 15-20 minutes. I showed up and my order was ready on time. The lady who rung me up was super friendly and even complimented my nails! I ordered a Crunch Shrimp Tempura Roll, a Dragon Roll and a Spicy Tuna Roll. I also got some edamame. It was super cheap and I got so much for my money. I honestly could not believe that the Spicy Tuna was only 3.95 and it was so big. The rolls were large and delicious. The fish was fresh and everything was prepared nicely. The edamame was still warm when I got back to my hotel room. I will definitely be back here again!"}
{"text":"Quality sushi for a great price! I've tried the Cali roll, spicy tuna, and the Mexican roll. They were all really good."}
{"text":"I have been here quite a few times already. I always get their tuna box or another one of the boxes. Comes with a sushi burrito, five piece of nigiri and some sort of breaded egg pie. Definetely one of my favorite lunch spots."}
{"text":"Made to order bento box type of restaurant in the furniture strip mall behind Nevada State high school. It is the order at the counter kind of casual place. Prices are decent and food is fresh."}
{"text":"It's a good place to grab your lunch and get back to work after the Goodlife gym on the other side of the building! I sitted inside for the first time and the lady even gave me a cup of hot green tea! They are quite focus of making good food which I like about. I tried the green dragon roll. It does not like some of the other reviewes mentioned that it's small. From my point of view, it's exactly the full size roll as you would get in a nice sushi restaurant. It's only 6.99 plus tax and my shrimp tempura inside the roll is hot and crispy!"}
{"text":"I love their bulgogi onigiri! It's so good! They also sell calpico here which is awesome because their hard to find in any retail store in Henderson XD"}
{"text":"Food was great and the delivery time was a lot faster than expected! Definitely ordering again."}
{"text":"This place is really cute and trendy. There weren't many people there, but I attribute that to it being in Henderson. The sushi was also a really good price and great portions. I'm really into this place and recommend it to all."}
{"text":"Small operations often come with so many challenges, but none harder then getting your name exposed. 
Sushi is very particular and I've had many many sushi experiences but have only returned to a few.
This place is underestimated.... I truly expected to be a one time experience, but was surprisingly delighted.
The rice is perfect, the flavors are excellent, and the fish was extra fresh.
Great pricing and great food. Gotta try it!"}
{"text":"I've only stopped by for a snack so far, but I was impressed. The food was good and fairly priced. They do things very efficiently to keep costs down without sacrificing quality. There was a large selection of dishes available, but I'm most excited about the fact that I can now get onigiri (rice balls) so close to home.

The staff was friendly and very attentive. The ambiance definitely leaned more towards a cafe than a sushi restaurant - there was no refrigerated display case on the counter containing the usual rainbow of sashimi. But overall, it was a new and unique take on the sushi experience. I look forward to future visits."}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking for a place to eat sushi and this place came up, so we gave it a try. By far the best sushi we have had in a long time. The service was great and the cafe is cute and clean. The lemon roll is by far my favorite and the spicy rolls are spicy. Everything is well priced as well. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who is knew to the area and looking for a fresh, fast, and clean dining experience!"}
{"text":"Yum!! I always come in about 1-3 times a week. The salmon bowl is to die for!! As are any of their monster boxes I frequently order. I live in the apartments right behind this place and I love coming here for my sushi fix."}
{"text":"My wife and I are sushi lovers .
But usually don't stray from our regular places .
However , we hesitantly stopped in here , and were BLOWN out of the water !! 
The sushi was incredibly fresh , and the service , was probably the best we have ever had.

Why doesn't this place have more reviews !!! 

Always going back . - Leighla and Vanessa"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place in town. The staff is incredibly warm and friendly and the sushi is fresh, delicious and very affordable. I almost don't want other people to know about my secret sushi spot because it's so great!"}
{"text":"Was in the area and wanted some Sushi.  We tried the Bulgogi Box and the Chicken Box and several Sushi Rolls.  It is setup to Order to Go but they have tables to stay in eat.  We were pleasantly surprised and would recommend."}
{"text":"I love this place because I can get sushi at an affordable price without having to leave Henderson! They definitely need to have more Asian food around this area and the popularity of Sushi Cafe is a good indicator of that.

I have tried the shrimp monster combo, bulgolgi combo, and the poke bowl (I almost spelled Pokeball instead...but there is a Pokestop nearby so farm away while waiting/eating!). 

Shrimp monster combo is my go to for takeout whenever I am craving for some sushi. For about $11, you get 5 pieces of nigiri, a croquette, and a shrimp tempura california roll style burrito. It is a bunch of food which can easily be enough for 2 meals. I highly recommend trying this if you don't know what you want lol. I did notice that the veggies they use in the burrito does vary at times (a low point was when they gave me a bunch of iceberg lettuce) so just be aware of that. 

The bulgolgi combo is pretty good as well. It comes with bulgolgi (duh), rice, seaweed salad, a croquette, and pickled onions(?). I decided to get this set since I wanted to try something besides the sushi and I wasn't disappointed. The only thing is that the meat portion seems small compared to how much rice you get. Also, the seaweed salad didn't taste as fresh as other places I have been to, but it isn't too bad. 

I got the Poke bowl here since I never had one, and figured it would be appropriate to try it here. You do get a ton of fish and can choose from veggies or salad. I opted for the salad option since I wanted a healthier option. The only gripe I have about this dish is they really drenched it with a lot of sauce. There was a bunch of flavor, but I got kinda sick halfway through my meal since my dish was literally swimming in the sauce lol...I'm not sure if it is like this in other places so I will have to update this post once I get more experience with this dish. 

This is a must try place if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"Oh man...I hate to give this place 2 stars since everyone seems to love it, but it is my honest review.

We ordered to go last night.  I ordered the Monster BBQ box and  hubby ordered the sashimi salad.

My BBQ BOX
-The calbi rolls were not good.  The meet was so chewy, that instead of wasting it, I gave it to Dolce, my adorable doggie.  She seems to love it, unfortunately, I am the one writing the review.
-The 4 piece nigiri are: shrimp, tuna, salmon, and another piece of I don't remember as they were all not good grade as they were chewy as well.  Didn't give this to Dolce as I don't know how she will react to this.
-The potato croquettes were yummy though.
-Seaweed salad - decent

Hubby's Sashimi Salad - not the traditional slices of sashimi you would find at other Sushi restaurant...they just topped the greens with poke style sashimi.  We didn't dig it very much.

Conclusion:  Fast take out place, but we will not be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"So let me just say, this is the most affordable yet fresh and superrrr good sushi I've had. I live very close so whenever I'm hungry for a roll or a sushi burrito or simply a couple nigiris, I come down here and I always spend under 20 dollars for REALLY good sushi!!!! I didn't trust it in the beginning because of the fact that it's cheap but when I decided to come here, I'm still so astonished !!! 

This is definitely my easy go-to sushi place! It's not a restaurant where you sit down and be served but food is made to order so it's definitely easy sushi whenever ! I love this place so much"}
{"text":"3 of the coolest owners. Great service and great food. It is now going to be our go to for take home."}
{"text":"WOW. I mean. WOW. Ate there for lunch for the first time today, and I want to have it again for dinner. I ordered the bowl; the fish and all of the ingredients were super fresh. We ordered the gyoza, potato cakes, and egg rolls--all were delicious. And the prices are a steal. 

One suggestion for the restaurant: please get on Postmates!"}
{"text":"Everything I ordered was delish I would definitely be back. Just sad they didn't have uni I hope they do the next time I come and they have great prices too."}
{"text":"So far so good, the staff is courteous and professional. The presentation and concept is fresh and exciting. We ordered 2 boxes, spicy tuna crispy rice, and gyoza all for $30 that's a deal. Including the Yelp check-in. Can't wait to take it home and dig in!"}
{"text":"Fish is very fresh. Prices are reasonable. Ahi poke is really yummy and flavorful. Portions are large. It is not busy, so food comes to you fast. Location is convenient.  Staff is helpful and nice. We will be back often!"}
{"text":"Great food. Affordable prices. Awesome customer service. One of my favorite places to get some sushi. Especially when I want to pick it up or have it delivered :)"}
{"text":"Went to this location on the way back to Vegas from the Hoover Dam. BEST SUSHI AND STAFF EVER!!!  If I could give it 6 stars I would! We are from Florida and used to fresh, amazing sushi...  This place delivers and then some. Very friendly staff and super reasonable prices."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The customer service is very good and they gave me a free green tea cheesecake"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a shot since the NBA playoffs were on, and they deliver.  Absolutely great and fresh sushi,order was placed through eat24 and came out perfect.  They even fully stocked me up with soy sauce and wasabi.  This will definitely be my only choice when it comes to delivering sushi!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! They have the best priced sushi I have ever seen, but haven't lowered the quality at all. They have basic rolls for $4! I come here all the time because of how delicious the food is and they have very friendly staff."}
{"text":"It was my first time here, and I came with my boyfriend after scrolling through new suggestions on Yelp. The first 60 reviews were relatively high and the restaurant looked nice and clean from the pictures, so we figured we'd try it. 
Just to mention, this was not our first choice on our list of Asian/sushi places. I settled with Sushi Cafe when I wasn't able to drive all the way to another sushi place on south eastern. It was close enough to be convenient and new enough to try it out. 
After giving it a chance, I'm thoroughly impressed and much happier than I would have been at the other place. It'll be my definite go-to place for quick and good quality food, plus the friendly service is a bonus. 
They also sell some authentic Asian desserts/snacks and drinks like cheesecake, pocky, calpico, tea, and hello panda. 
I will definitely come back for more!"}
{"text":"Great little place with great sushi for a great price. Guy at the counter was really nice and quick. Had the sushi combo and the rice to ingredient ratio was perfect - a thin layer of rice and a good amount of avocado and sushi."}
{"text":"I've been checking this place out before it opened and I want to say that it not only met my expectations but it went above. Sushi cafe has such a unique concept you've never seen before. The sushi is very fresh, the service is amazing, they are all super friendly. Defiantly worth checking it out!!!!!!(:"}
{"text":"Very good spot. The prices are very good. I hope in time they don't raise the prices. I got a lunch box and it was a lot of food for only 10$$ have not found cheaper sushi in Vegas. Very authentic and good selection."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful courteous service first time visiting. Prices amazed me I'm always used to purchasing sushi for twice as much. I have overdone myself this time. Only 4 minutes away, this is my new forever spot!!!"}
{"text":"This is my new spot to eat lunch when I have breaks in between classes! 

Right when I walked in, I already felt comfortable seeing lounge couches included as the dining seats. I had to take up this area good for 4 persons at a table. They have a back patio decor combined with Asian accents. Lighting is great along with the fixtures. I see that they have a sushi bar not in use and they should install bar stools along the counter. They can open up that concept to make the experience personal with the sushi chef.  

I took a picture of the menu, so you could find it in the photos to pick out your options. 

Personally, I ordered the Bulgogi Box $9.00 which comes complete with rice, seaweed salad and tamago. I also added a shrimp tempura appetizer. 

My friends all did sushi roll orders that start at $5.95 

The owner of the cafe complimented our lunch with a free waffle mochi ice cream w/ red bean paste and strawberry syrup toppings. He made our experience feel like top class!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to go on lunch break! You will be SHOCKED by how high the quality of food is for such a low price!! Owner is super nice and shows appreciation to his customers. The most important thing that I noticed about Sushi Café is how FRESH the ingredients are. Owner buys salmon, and any raw/fish products on a daily basis. If you call in around 4PM there wont be much left besides veggie options. Trust me that's a GOOD thing. I highly recommend the spicy salmon roll and the dynamite."}
{"text":"Wow this price gives you huge portions for a low price!  I got the green dragon roll and omg it was huge and it was only $5.99.  Going back to try their other lunch combos soon!  The price is quite unbelievable and the quality is good!  The quality is better than a lot of other sushi places and franchises in the financial district and the portions are just a bonus!  It is definitely better than sushi Q & sushi shop for a portion of the price.  I was surprised to not see a line up with this kind of quality and pricing!  But it might also be because I went around 1PM, but STILL!!!!!  My place to visit on a weekly basis since I work nearby."}
{"text":"This is my third time here. Each time has been fast and friendly service. It's a nice cozy little sushi place. It's right near my work and has great prices for the rolls ! They recently got boba too. So if you like boba, I'd try it !"}
{"text":"A great addition to the eateries littered all over Stephanie St over here in Henderson. I am literally 5 minutes away from this place and could not be more happy about it opening. It's a fast/casual sushi restaurant which is a nice sight to see in the LV sea of AYCE sushi joints. 

I've been here several times since Celina C. recommended it to me and I'm sure I will be back to satisfy that sushi craving that many of us get. I've gotten the Monster Box w/ kalbi roll, 5 pieces of nigiri, seaweed salad and potato croquette for ~$10. It's a pretty solid deal with a good amount of food. 

I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and taste of the fish on the nigiri. It was pretty good and fresh. Was it the BEST sushi I've ever tasted? No, but it's excellent value for what it is. I will have to come in again soon to try the POKE (They spell in 'poki' and it bothers me to no end. Us Hawaii folk know what's up, right?)

There is tons of parking in front of the restaurant and a good amount of seating inside the restaurant as well. I'm hoping this place picks up in business and sustains itself."}
{"text":"First time here. This place is right by our house and wanted to give it a try. We ordered the lemon roll, Hawaiian roll, ikura and poke salad. Not impressed. It was just Okay. Definitely nothing special."}
{"text":"Best quick eats in the area. I work up the street and this is my best option for a quick somewhat healthy lunch. I came here and got the Tuna Poke Bowl two days in a row. Soo good, fish quality and portion was great also!"}
{"text":"If you want good service and delicious yet affordable sushi--check this place out. I've been here twice and both experiences have been awesome! They are consistent with their service and food taste amazing. Cheap eats with good quality!"}
{"text":"Decent sushi. This place is very casual as far as sushi places go. The special rolls are cheaper (7.95) than other spots but once I started eating, I realized why. I ordered a dragon roll and the eel was only on top - the middle was filled with some sort of imitation crab mix. It wasn't bad just forgettable.

Friendly and fast service. It's cheap obviously but it's debatable whether or not it might be worth it to get better sushi for a few dollars more."}
{"text":"Great quality (and quantity) sushi! Not your typical sushi bar .... more of a to-go place.  Call in your orders and pick it up.  Prices are awesome - try the monster rolls and poke bowls. Their spicy tuna monster roll is the best!"}
{"text":"Stopped into this place for a quick bite and was not disappointed. I got a spicy tuna roll and 1 order each of salmon and yellowtail sashimi. The pricing is amazing for what you get. My sashimi cuts were generous, and only $4.95 for 4 slices of the salmon sashimi, and another $4.95 for 4 slices of the yellowtail sashimi. I'm really particular about spicy tuna and there's was pretty good. If you're looking for a fancy or super swanky sushi place, this isn't it, but if you enjoy sushi, sashimi, poke, and other items at a very reasonable price for what you get with a very laid back environment, this is for you. They will do free delivery if it's with a 3 mile radius with a $30 purchase, and are also available for delivery with some other delivery services. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The gentleman who took my order and rung me up was polite and kind when I asked for extra radish, he asked if I wanted a water cup since I didn't order a drink, and even came over to check on me later to make sure I had gotten enough radish. Fish quality was very good and very fresh, I'm still shocked at how inexpensive my sashimi was for such generous slices. I'm also very picky about sushi and quality, and while some of their rolls do have imitation crab, which I don't eat as it makes me ill, there is plenty of fresh selection and the prices can't be beat. I've been eating sushi since I was 6 and this will definitely be a great stop for me. I will definitely have this as a go to for when I just want a quick roll or two, I definitely can't say enough good things about this place."}
{"text":"My 1st time eating Sushi in Vegas. This place jis clean and friendly. The FOOD was fresh and yummy!!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a good and affordable sushi spot a while back and came across this little gem on Yelp. I went in to order food to go and was greeted by the very genuine team and owner. The owner and I chatted for a bit and when my food was ready he handed me my bag and told me he threw in a free dessert. I was very satisfied with the fresh rolls, tempura, seaweed salad and of course the dessert. This place is now my sushi home. I don't go anywhere else."}
{"text":"This place was recommended from a friend and it's a quaint, little sushi spot that has super affordable prices! I was surprised at the prices for all the rolls. The rolls are a little small, but they give about 6-8 rolls per order (makes up for the size). They have a lot of different entrees and appetizers as well if you're not looking for sushi.

It's really cheap and was perfect for my sushi fix without having to break my wallet. I would definitely come back when in the area!"}
{"text":"I loved the flavor and portion sizes. The pricing is great for the portions and service that you receive from this establishment. I'm excited about living less than a mile away from this sushi restaurant. I had the Philadelphia roll, it was fresh and plentiful."}
{"text":"They have Bento Boxes, Poki, Sushi Burritos as well as sushi?  Unexpected extra offerings everywhere.  I like mashups in songs and comic books when done correctly.  I was hopeful on my first visit on a Saturday afternoon at 12 PMish.  

Service: 3/5 They had only 3 employees total working this visit.  It appeared to be one manager, one Chef/Server and one hostess/server all trying to take care of a pretty busy lunch crowd.  They did their best but I had to ask for a refill and took awhile to find someone to get the check.  They were very friendly and they're 1 FTE from a smooth running place on this visit

Food: 4/5 Pleasantly surprised with variety of offerings.  I'm on this Bento Box trip so I went the Bulgogi Box which came with: rice, seaweed salad, tamago and gyoza.  Bulgogi was very tasty and everything else was up to par.  I noticed that you can order 2 pieces of Nigiri and fired away with the: yellowtail, Smelt Egg and the White Tuna.  Great quality for the p.rice which is coming up.

Value: 5/5 Bulgogi Box was $9.95 of amazing value.  Going to be doing a tour of all the boxes they offer on my next visits.  The Nigiri was $2.95 for 2 pieces which worked out perfectly as it allowed me to pick and choose and keep things relatively cheap while getting relatively full.  I'm looking forward to trying the Monster Box which is a Sushit Burrito with 5 pieces of Nigiri for $9.95.

Ambiance: 3.5 The tables seem to be made from some kind of old gate door with multiple planks of wood? Looks cool, but makes the table uneven.  No biggie.  Plenty of seating but this might be one of those places where I'll be ordering for pickup vs eating in.

Summary: A one stop place for Bento Boxes, Sushi (Nigiri and Rolls), Poki, and Sushi Burritos.  The offerings are extra af and I'm stoked to find this place.  I'll keep updating reviews as I keep trying new things. Good times coming. =)"}
{"text":"This place is legit! Gotta say, i'm impressed with the concept of fast food sushi to go style. Their spicy pork and regular bulgogi was DELICIOUS! The guy who works the front was so nice he came up to us to talk story and tell us the concept of their restaurant. He said they will soonbe delivering at NO EXTRA CHARGE within a 3 mile radius real soon also. As we were walking out, he gave us red bean mochi for free! How nice is that?!? Either way, great place!"}
{"text":"Came here with the sissy to try it out since it was a new place. First off, very clean and the workers are all so nice and polite. You can see them making your food . The prices are reasonable for the amount of food you get. I got the bulgogi box and it was tasty, sissy got california roll and spicy tuna, both rolls were delicious and fresh. We shared a spicy tuna with crispy rice app and that is a must have."}
{"text":"First of all, it was just freezing in the restaurant.  It really felt like a blast chiller.  Sushi was decent, however, deciphering the menu was a bit difficult.  They seriously need pictures in their menu!  Prices were decent, however, I was just not digging the sushi burrito.  It is so Americanized (bad thing), like rice and salad, with a little fish all rolled into one.  Filling yes, but not satisfying (ie not enough fish).  I suppose I prefer classic style Japanese sushi."}
{"text":"I would suggest this restaurant concept to any sushi lover!!! Concept is, fast, take-out like eatery but this is Why they are able to give you quality grade sushi; Fresh!!! They do not have waiters or waitresses, to help keep overhead costs down, & with what they save they are able to buy you Fresh grade sushi right from a Japanese Vendor, & (let's not kid ourselves) who knows fish better than those who created \"Sushi?\" ...when one eats sushi, 1st question you should ask restaurant is, \"where do you get your fish?\" ...very important question, to avoid Mercury, food poisoning, etc! Oh, & they cater too!!! I would recommend to anyone who loves sushi but don't want to spend loads of cash downtown on expensive restaurants just to get fresh sushi! & the owners are so friendly!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered 4 rolls and bulgogi box. Not worth $28. Taste ok, similar to Smiths. Bulgogi box had more rice than anything else."}
{"text":"Environment:
Coming into the cafe, you will immediately notice that it is pretty small, as there are only 4 seats and no public bathroom. However, being a small hole in the wall restaurant means that there's a good chance most customers will order their food to go.  


Cost & Portion:
Luckily when I was there there were only two other customers. I ordered 3 rolls, each took less than 5 minutes to come out. The price for the sushi is relatively low (average $6), so the portions tend to be smaller than regular sushi restaurants. If you come on a completely empty stomach than you'd need at least two rolls. 

Food Quality:
+ The portions may be small and the prices may seem cheap, but the quality is definitely reliable. The sushi is fresh and comes together very well. 
- The seaweed was a bit too tough, though this was only present in one of the three rolls.

Overall this is a good spot to grab some cheap, quality sushi while you're in downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"Back again. Been very busy but even after some time away the service and quality is solid. Of course they have most of the basic sushi options (which is perfect for me) but they know to offer comparable alternatives when they're out of a specific product. Great place that i hope never closes!"}
{"text":"Sushi cafe's salmon poke bowl is to die for!!!!! Ordered for pick up and my food was ready on time. My new favorite casual sushi spot!"}
{"text":"Fresh and quality!! Sushi and tempura are very good! Fish is fresh and good quality. Tempura items are cooked perfectly. All prices are reasonable and service is fast! There are many other Japanese grocery items to select from here as well, such as bottled drinks (Ramune & Calpico!!), ramen bowls, snacks. Bento boxes are a great deal too and come with other sides that many places don't give (tempura-fried kobucha squash [goroke] and sweet egg [tamago])
Even Japanese desserts are available: mochi cakes, green tea cheesecake, pound cakes.

They have a great thing going here and hopefully it stays around for a long time! I will be back, often!"}
{"text":"Legit sushi joint. Big fat rolls and not sll rice like most places. Friendly service. Not fancy but just right. Definitely will come back next time in town"}
{"text":"Took my husband and I a few mins to find. When you walk in it's set up pretty odd. You don't no whether to sit down and order or go up to the counter to order. 
The food was ok, texture of the spicy tuna was over done. My second roll was the red dragon and that would of been better if they hadn't doused it sauce. Husband got the box of spicy pork. 
Food: 2 out of 5
Service: 3 out of 5

Maybe the next visit will be better.."}
{"text":"Food is amazing with a price you can't beat. Service was great and the owners are way cool"}
{"text":"The name \"Sushi Cafe\" is a little misleading, disappointing and underwhelming. The last thing Sushi Cafe is, is just another sushi joint. Bento Cafe? Sushi burrito Cafe? Lunch box Cafe? Poki Cafe? All of those would bring more people in and would better describe their menu. 
I think the highlight of Sushi Cafe is their Protein Box lunches. Rice, veggies, seaweed salad, korokke, egg and your choice of meat = Protein box. The Monster Box includes a giant sushi burrito and 5 pieces of sushi. SUCH a good deal AND they serve it in those cute brown boxes and not styrofoam- yippeee! 
I've had the fried white fish and the chicken protein box.
Fried white fish: I was a little worried at first (it looked like the frozen fish sticks you can buy), but they were far from it. There was plenty of fish in it and it tasted GOOD. I loved it, but for me, having fried fish and also fried korokke in the box was a little too much fry for me. It put me into a food coma way too fast. 
Chicken protein box: yes, yes, yes. So much chicken! The sauce is in a container on the side so you don't have to be worried about it being drenched in teriyaki. 

The sushi bento boxes were another story. 
The quality of the nigiri was HORRIBLE and the giant rolls were pretty bad. The salmon in my roll was so tough I couldn't bite through it. It was like chewing on rubber- a couple of bites of that and I had to spit it out. It was easily the worst piece of fish I've ever had. I would not recommend ordering anything with raw fish from here. 

There is no AC in Sushi Cafe................................ I wouldn't recommend eating here, just taking out on your lunch break or on your way home. They also have some Japanese snacks, drinks (Calpis, etc) for sale and cup noodle with a hot water machine as well."}
{"text":"Love Sushi Cafe!  I always get either the Korean BBQ or Beef Bulgogi. I'm satisfied every time. I haven't ventured outside of their bento boxes but they have an assortment of fresh sushi and salads. Parking is extremely easy. The waitresses and cashier are always so friendly. Highly recommend Sushi Cafe to everyone!"}
{"text":"Usually I wait after going to sushi places a few times to determine star rating... But this place blew my socks off. Super cheap and super delicious! They don't have servers so you have to order from the cashier but I like it better that way. The cucumber salad has the perfect amount of vinegar and their sashimi is out. Of. This. World! The white tuna is the best! Keep up the great work, guys!"}
{"text":"Food is decent, however after almost two years, service is still inefficient. We were the only table of 6 people and they managed to forget one order"}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW!  The food here is fabulous!  Kiss of Fire roll was the best I have had! The service very attentive. Great prices, too!  I am so glad I found this place!"}
{"text":"Very clean restaurant with friendly staff. They are very helpful if you are not sure what to get! Great to see a local sushi place around the corner from my house that has a great variety of sushi options at a fair price. They even have hi-chew and yan-yan to keep your little ones entertained.

Just a tip - their rice seems to be a blend of a little bit of brown rice. Perhaps a little bit on the healthier side?"}
{"text":"Cafe style sushi restaurant located in a strip mall in Henderson. 

I was confused when I walked in because there were no signs to either sit at a table, wait for a table, or order at the counter. We were finally seated at one of the few tables.

The menu was very very small. The prices were reasonable. The sushi was ok.

If you are looking for a quick lunch or delivery this place will do, but don't come here for a nice dinner."}
{"text":"It's a cute spot to get quick and affordable sushi. I got the monster box for $10. Everyone there was nice. They even have ramen noodles there if you want. Seatings are for small parties or to go orders are what they seem to mostly cater to."}
{"text":"Love love love this sushi spot!!! I've been here multiple times already and they have really great, fresh sushi! The prices are extremely reasonably & very affordable, too. For 5 pieces of sashmi, tempura hand roll, & 2 pieces of gyoza is about $10! STEAL! 

This is great for lunch or dinner. The owners are very nice and welcoming. The inside is nice and clean, so no complaint there. 

I highly recommend this place and I will be returning customer as long as they are open! Check this place out if you haven't, totally worth it. :)"}
{"text":"2/15 allowed the chef to choose our sushi today. So tasty. The waitress still remembered our names after not coming for a month. Really good food, great price and comfortable atmosphere. Great family sushi place. 5 people stuffed with sushi $70"}
{"text":"I'm excited to have this new sushi restaurant so close to home. 

We were looking for something light for dinner to grab and take home last night. I have had this on my list and sushi is light so this was the winner.

My first impression is that the restaurant is very clean and simple. The employee working at the counter greeted us immediately. He gave us a paper menu to look at and help us decide what to order since we were obviously there for the first time.

Our order came up in about five minutes which I thought was fast for a walk in order. Everything was packaged nicely and they even included napkins, silverware, chopsticks, and soy sauce. 

All of the rolls we ordered were very good and fresh. They were notably better than other sushi I've had recently. The Lemon Roll was my favorite and the lemon added a great twist to the flavor. The Shrimp Tempura Roll was delicious and had plenty of crunchy topping. The Mexican Roll had the perfect amount of avocado on top and the right amount of heat. My edamame wasn't very tender and not my favorite item. The Green Tea Cheesecake sounded interesting, but was not my cup of tea, pun intended. There was nothing wrong with the cheesecake, it just wasn't my thing.

The menu definitely offers more than just rolls so I'm excited to return and try more of the menu items."}
{"text":"Excellent, fresh sushi and very friendly staff. Delivery too! We've already made plans to come back later this week!"}
{"text":"Very cool place. Love the menu. I have had lunch a few time and Sushi Cafe never disappoints. First time I ordered too much not realizing how filling the portions were but I did get a chance to try a few items. I highly recommend the Tuna Bowl. It is truly the best place I have experienced in the area and food is always fresh and tasty. The place is also very clean and it has very comfortable couch style seating."}
{"text":"first off, I would post a pic of da food but it's in my tummy! sushi was pretty good slammed 3 rolls off da bat, bulgogi mean, prices Akamai! place is def on da radar."}
{"text":"I was optimistic about this place from the beginning! We saw this sushi spot on the way home from work one day, and decided to come by that weekend. First thought going inside, is how comfy and cute the place is! There's plenty of tables to sit if an influx of customers come in all at once! They have a cute waiting area too, if you're a customer ordering to go. The menu was small and simple, and everything was priced fairly well! We ordered one bulgogi box, a lemon roll, a red dragon roll, a tiger roll and a caterpillar roll for under $50. Safe to say, we were both full and satisfied with our meal! I will definitely be coming back here again, for either a light lunch or heavy dinner! The service was great to boot!"}
{"text":"Wow! I ate there for the first time last week and am already dreaming about what I will get next time I go back, and that should be SOON! I love, love, loved this place. Very nice people, good service, and most of all the freshest, most imaginative and creative sushi presentation in this area. I really didn't expect much, so I was thrilled at how luscious my lunch - got the Monster Box  - was. Actually, there was only one glitch: almost too much food! (How bad can that be, right?) Strangely (or not so strangely) I was able - or should I say willing - to get it all down and I was happily stuffed as I left the restaurant. Of course, sushi being sushi, it was all good. It's a healthy way to fill up. Just wonderful. Don't miss out on this one. Let's make it a super popular spot so that it will stay with us for a long time. Thanks for the great meal! Oh, and by the way, the place has a nice atmosphere, very minimalist, gleaming wood tables, so clean and pleasant. And quiet. That's a big one for me. I hate noisy restaurants."}
{"text":"Our waitress, whose name is Nuri, was an extraordinary server.  She clearly explained everything to us and was very responsive. She had excellent suggestions and make sure we had everything we needed. She gave us a few tips and was very friendly to our kids. In addition the food was truly delicious. The rules are the best. We highly advocate for the  shrimp tempura roll and my absolute diehard favorite which was the Philadelphia roll.   The edamame and the seaweed salad was also delicious.  The Edamame beans were perfect with some delicious kosher sea salt.   

You will not be disappointed.  If your experience will be anything like ours, you'll be very glad you came. We were here at 8 PM and didn't feel rushed even though it was the end of the day.  

The service was fast and delightful.  

All five members of my family rated it as a six out of five stars"}
{"text":"Waited in line for 20 mins. Waited for my order for 15. A family of 3 we're in line after me ordered 3 monsters and received their order before me.           (I ordered 2 basic rolls). My order was wrong so I  let the lady know and all I got was attitude. She said I would have to wait because other customers are in front of me. WAIT?! I wouldn't mind waiting for my order to be fixed but I'm not waiting for 3 other customers food to be made before mine gets fixed."}
{"text":"We have been looking for a chill tasty sushi place close to our home and we found it! We walked in and we're immediately greeted and given a menu. I ordered the assorted poki and my wife the crunch shrimp tempura roll and the Hawaii roll. We sat and said, \"I hope this place is good\". We were already liking the vibe. To our surprise it was! It was so fresh!! You can tell it was made with love lol Anyway, we are forever customers!"}
{"text":"This place has been around for some time, it is quite a shady take-out restaurant located on the corner of a building at ground level...at first glance you would not consider going in here for coffee, sandwiches or SUSHI!

They offer breakfast sandwiches, lunch sandwiches, coffee, tea and a bunch of sushi during the lunch rush..at an amazing price!

For those of you who know North York..this is the Sushi Bong of the financial district.

I got a green dragon roll for $5.99 (8 pieces).. they also have 12 piece spicy salmon for $4.99 and a bunch of other combinations for an insanely cheap price..the ingredients are fresh. The size of the rolls are generous with large chunks of avocado! 

There is not much seating in the cramped space, a handful of bar seats along the window.. But there are tons of food courts steps away connected to the PATH. 

They only open until 4PM."}
{"text":"This Cafe is so convenient for me as i do work next door to them, and i have only been there twice, but I'll for sure be going here more often.

I was introduced to this place by my coworker because everyone goes here for their lunch break. I was not disappointed with anything i got from there, and now I'm just a little addicted to their boba tea.

The employees are super nice, and they explain everything on the menu. At first i was skeptical because i only get boba from the boba place by my house since the quality is perfect over there + I've been going there since middle school. After trying it a couple times here i have learned to like it, it's a bit different, but it's refreshing and delicious."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is awesome. I had a combo bowl and it was so much food I couldn't finish it all. The place is very clean and the staff is very helpful with their menu and super friendly. Thank you for the great service!"}
{"text":"5 Stars *****

Yes. It was that good. It was some of the best poke I have had in Vegas. They don't smother the fish in sea salt and oil like some places do. You can actually taste the fish. They also fried us some tofu, which was not on the menu. That was nice of them. The yellowtail hand roll and the dragon roll were also excellent.

The kitchen and dining area were very clean. The staff was very friendly. It was definitely worth the drive from Summerlin. I recommend that you stop in and have some poke or whatever else you care to try. I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Got the spicy pork bowl and sushirrito bowl. Delicious! Comes with fried potato and seaweed salad. Great for lunch!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Tuna Poke Bowl Salad and it was one of the  best. The price is reasonable and the food is really good. The staff is very nice and we were well taken care of"}
{"text":"This place is really good. The fish is fresh and the service is friendly and super accommodating. The bowl and monster box are my favorite. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I keep coming back here but since my last review, I've ordered off the menu. It's so delicious too! Ive tried numerous rolls and haven't been disappointed with any of them. The staff is quiet and focused. I have zero complaints about here. It's so affordable and so good!"}
{"text":"OMG. Amazing food. Fresh, healthy, good prices, very nice owner,  great sushi.  I will be back here a lot  THE BEST"}
{"text":"I've had this place bookmarked for a while, but it's so far away from my house. Since I was on this side of town, I decided to stop by with my best friend. We came in around 6:45/7? On a Thursday night. It wasn't packed, probably 2 tables occupied. 

Their menu doesn't have a lot but I consider that a good thing. I opted for the tempura box & we shared a jackpot roll. She ordered the Korean BBQ box. I didn't expect to see a lot of food in the box that I ordered but, to my surprise, it came with other stuff besides the tempura & rice! It also had tamago, gyoza, seaweed salad, and pickled something. I didn't try the pickled thing but everything in my box was amazing. The tempura was plentiful and definitely wasn't too heavy. I wish they put furikake on the rice (maybe I'll ask for that next time). I tried her Korean BBQ & it was alright, nothing spectacular. The jackpot roll was really good! It had a little kick to it. 

Service was great! The server made sure our waters were always filled and asked us how everything was frequently. There are many Japanese/sushi places next to me so idk if I'd go all the way to the other side of town, but I'll definitely stop by if I'm around the area!"}
{"text":"This place is really worth checking out. For a mom and pop shop the service is super friendly, the place is very clean and actually quite hip. I got the bulgogi box and it was super tasty. The owner is really nice and professional. They have so many options here you can try and I will definitely be back to try the sushi.plenty of parking in the strip mall and the nice dining area would make it great to sit down with some friends and family. Prices are very reasonable to and the portions are good. The owner even showed me order my make sure it was right. With such great service and such good food, I will definitely make this place my go to for lunches and dinner to go. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"From 5 stars to 1 star after they re-opened with new ownership of management. My husband picked it up for dinner tonight... first my tuna was grey colored. Never a good sign, but I tasted it and then continued to pluck the rest out of my bowl and throw away. Next, I took a bite of my masago sushi... and I can't remember the last time I spit out my food, but immediately I gagged and spit it out. The eggs had gone rancid. Part of me wants to go back and ask for a refund, but instead I'll show my disdain by not going back. And hoping what I did eat doesn't come back up.  So sad... it used to be so good! And it's so close to my house!"}
{"text":"Great little spot for a sushi fix! The sushi tastes great and fresh and the service is really good. It's a really good value for the price because the portions are generous and taste is 10/10!"}
{"text":"Always good to see a new place open up close to home. Now I have a favorite Sushi place. The meal I had was healthy, delicious, and high quality. Clean and friendly staff. It can't get any better than this. I highly recommend \"Sushi Cafe\". The grilled chicken is excellent too and you can get it in the offered \"Box\" size, which is also perfect for one person. More than enough food and you won't leave hungry. Great value too!"}
{"text":"Great food, service, and they deliver.  Nice little Sushi Cafe in Henderson"}
{"text":"Excelente lugar, cerca de union station para cuándo haces escala y necesitas algo rápido y cerca, pero no quiere decir que por ello sea solo cumplidor, sino que además rebasa la espectativa. Sin duda lo recomiendo y regresaria."}
{"text":"This place is \"ok\". .. Everytime I've gone here I've purchased sushi to go and Everytime I'm somewhat disappointed.. I feel it's like going to Smith's and buying the prepackaged sushi. I've gotten a poke bowl there once as well and it doesn't compare to the many poke express companies... It actually turned me off from eating poke bowls for months. The restaurant is cute but food not so much."}
{"text":"Great tasting dragon rolls and gyoza! Speedy service. I will probably order here again :)"}
{"text":"Amazing, fresh, and delicious sushi. Good to grab and go, eat there, or for delivery. Great prices also! I found my new sushi spot! I love it"}
{"text":"I was afraid to try this place because I'm a sushi snob. I got the rock and roll, and the salmon bowl with salad no rice. The rock and roll was packed with tuna! And it was cheap! I dipped it in eel sauce and it was amazing. The jam pack the sushi with raw fish. The prices are very reasonable. The service is great. The place is clean."}
{"text":"The green dragon roll was quite delicious and filling. Very small place so it's quite easy to miss; had to stumble back and forth a bit to find where heenan pl was LOL (my lack of directional sense also contributed to that). They raised their prices - the green dragon roll was originally 5.99 and it's now 6.99."}
{"text":"Sushi Cafe is a hidden gem on University Avenue. Walk too quickly and you'll miss it (and you'll kick yourself for doing so). 
It's a spot best for pickup only. You can choose PATH food court to enjoy your sushi score. 
I've been several times and realized I hadn't shared my thoughts with my fellow Yelpers. 
Prices: pretty good for what you get. Portion sizes are quite generous. Red Dragon Roll for $5.99 - fresh salmon, generous shrimp tempura sizing. They'll make it to order or choose from a prepackaged offering. 
Miso soup is piping hot (be careful!) but delicious just the same. 
The lady and gentleman who run the place are super friendly. They always greet me with a warm \"hello\" and they are thankful for your patronage. 
If you're looking for a quick sushi pickup - check out this little spot. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"This is my 3rd time here and I won't be coming back due to the fact that the lady up front at the cashier is a total rude BITCH. The simple questions I asked about the menu she couldn't even answer with giving me a face that I could   love to punch in the face. Bitch I can go other places and spend money. Food is ok but now I'm not even coming back in the future"}
{"text":"This is a self service type of restaurant. You order want you want, grab your own beverages, or what's around that you want. There's even noodles you can buy and a hot water dispenser for it. Everything is in plastic containers to easily go or be tossed. The cashier was very friendly and came around to check on the guests.

I got the poke bowl. You get a lot for your money. I couldn't even put a dent in it. I took the rest home. The bowl isn't simple with just poke and rice. There's also salad, avocado, ginger, imitation crab, and all these little things to add more flavor to every bite. There was something spicy in it so if you can't handle hot, beware.

Overall, I like this place. I will be back. Great lunch spot. The cashier was nice enough to give us a free dessert. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Fantastic quality food! Really loved this place nice amazing sushi rolls and sushi burrito. Great portion  and very fresh! Also the prices are awesome! I am always served by Kay she makes you feel at home, one of my new go to's in town!"}
{"text":"Seriously so good! Been to a couple sushi places in town definitely one of my favorites. Awesome customer service and genuine people. Love the atmosphere and the foods a plus too."}
{"text":"Their food is really good and service has always been great. There was a day where they closed early, but other than that everything's always been good. My boyfriend is a fan of their salmon poke bowl, and I love their lemon sushi roll. I'll keep coming back to this hole in the wall."}
{"text":"First time visiting - extremely friendly and the bulgogi box was delicious. Seemed like more of a takeout place, and for 9.95 - the bulgogi box was really good."}
{"text":"It took me a couple of days to write my review but I finally did it!!! Totally recommend this place everything is delicious and the service what can I say it's just amazing KK was fantastic!.... she talked to us recommended new stuff from there menu and whatever we didn't knew she will take her time to explain and let us try it was really nice of her and quick service.... what else can you ask for cute place, amazing customer service, food and quick service."}
{"text":"Food was great, staff was very friendly and establishment very clean.  Will definitely come back when in town again."}
{"text":"This place was super cozy! I love the seats! Couches! I love sushi and the selection here was not only delicious but the prices are seriously decent!"}
{"text":"This is not a fancy place, but everything we've tried has been great!   We especially like the poke bowls - salmon, tuna, whitefish, combo - all good.  We've had sushi, rolls, baked - all yummy.   Friendly staff, and some sofa tables that are very comfortable.  And the prices are very reasonable about 1/2 of what a sushi bar charges, and frankly better quality than some.  We keep coming."}
{"text":"I really like the food and prices here but had a very bad experience with a Yelp order. Showed up and they had not seen my order (about 30 minutes after ordering) I was told it would be ready in 20 minutes so I left and came back. 30 minutes later they had still not started making my food! After about 10 minutes of waiting in the restaurant I finally got my food. It was good, as always, but the service was horrible."}
{"text":"Sushi cafe is just what this part of Henderson needed. A casual place to get Asian food (mainly Japanese and Korean food) or a quick to go meal. Sometimes you just have want a sushi roll or two without committing to AYCE. I got the box with the Korean BBQ, which was marinated sliced beef. It came with some pretty good sides like seaweed salad, egg, and goroke (a croquette made with some kabocha squash and potato). The sushi is legit here, it's fresh and tasty. My favorites are the lemon roll and jackpot roll. Customer service is very friendly and the owners took time to chat and get feedback, which is always a nice touch. There are even snacks to go like instant ramen bowls, rice balls, and some candy.

{"text":"I wouldn't come here for a poke bowl... You can't choose what you want like an actual poke place does. I order a sushi burrito basically and squid sashimi. Also it would have been nice to have more choice of sashimi instead of 1 type of fish for the 6 pieces. And also I would go somewhere else if you like variety bc their menu is pretty small. The squid I got for sashimi was poor quality"}
{"text":"This place needs to be discovered by more people.  So far, I've been her twice and have not been disappointed. The Monster Box and poke bowl is really good and for a great price.  The staff is nice as well.  Would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi place I've been to! Great atmosphere, amazing prices, and perfect staff! 

I would definitely recommend this place and will be eating here again!"}
{"text":"Found this place accidentally. Originally looking for a poke place, but most were closed by 9. This place closed at 10 (on Tuesday), and it was a great find. I spoke to one of the employees and mentioned they had only been open 5 weeks. We were pleased with our choices. I ordered the tuna poke bowl and the portion was beyond my expectation. I could only finish half, but was tasty. My boyfriend ordered the shrimp tempura roll, spicy crab roll and the lemon roll. Our favorite, the lemon roll. Great, fresh taste! Planning on going back to try the other sushi items and their spicy pork bowl! Prices are also reasonable."}
{"text":"Eat here all the time. The sushi is always good and fresh and the prices aren't bad. Would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Love the place! Is very nice and clean, affordable prices and easy menu to follow, the food is really good! Customer service is fast and very friendly, Jay made sure the we are comfortable and answer any questions we have. I will recommended the place 100 % definitely will come back."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town and we found this place. Amazing sushi! If you like spicy, ask for the Kiss of Fire roll. Great customer service. I only wish they had a location in California."}
{"text":"I work right next door and usually go to another place for all you can eat, but I was craving sushi and looked through the reviews and saw someone's picture and wanted it. I showed the man the picture of someone else's review and that's exactly what I got. Very good service and my meal was so tasteful. Would definitely recommend this place and come back for more!"}
{"text":"I've been getting their rolls to go and so far have tried the lemon roll, spider roll, spicy rainbow, and their shrimp tempura monster roll, which all tasted great. Staff is also very nice and quick at making my take out order. Overall my experience here is great, but the prices for the rolls may be a little high compared to other sushi places. However I don't mind since it's one of the only good sushi places by my area."}
{"text":"Great!
The food, drink and service!
Very friendly

Also they have a very unique menu
Including triangular sushi, instant noodle, and bento boxes!(with sweet potato croquet!)

I had their bento boxes with my friends and my favorite was the korean bulgogi box.

I strongly recommend you to try their rolls too bc they r not expensive for a special roll and it has a good quality!"}
{"text":"Unremarkable.
Everything is served in disposable plastic or paper. No table service, place your order at the counter. No hot tea. Interesting concept, we won't be back. The food was quite ordinary."}
{"text":"I started coming here about a year ago and I must say that this is my go-to sushi place. They are a smaller establishment but the quality is very high! Their sushi is excellent and their other dishes (including poki and sashimi) follow suit. Over the last 8 months they have done some serious remodeling and I am in LOVE! It's not just the scenery it's the service. It's more like a restaurant now, service wise, and the atmosphere is borderline \"hipster coffee shop\". 12/10 would recommend to a friend!"}
{"text":"Let's just say that it's about time a sushi joint opened up in this area. With so many business around we needed a quick sushi fix in the neighborhood. Saw my Niece post a review about this and was shocked! I never heard of it...I never even knew it existed. Raved about it all last week to my coworkers and we finally went there for lunch today. I couldn't be more satisfied! We got the monster roll box. Different types and all were delicious! For $10.77, you get your money worth and it's excellent sushi I may add. Fish was fresh! Monster box came with a monster sushi (sushi burrito), 5 piece of sushi (diff fish) and two fried mashed potato tempura (don't know the name) but that was good. It's mash potato and mashed sweet potato deep fried! HEAVEN! Staff was nice and friendly. Answered all our questions. Place was spacious and clean. Prices are more than affordable! This is a must try place. Only two downfall was it was hot inside. They had a big fan blowing but not sure if the AC was not fully working or what. Also, I would recommend to add more spicy mayo. We had 3 different monster rolls (sushi burritos) and all lacked spicy mayo but still amazing flavors."}
{"text":"Our first time coming here. We got the tempura bento box, shrimp tempura roll and California Maki . Also the miso soup. All.of it was delicious. Generous portions, tasty food and very good prices. Service was also very attentive. We would come back here for sure."}
{"text":"My husband and I found this little cafe after waiting a whole day at the DMV, we were absolutely famished. We were immediately greeted with very friendly staff. He assisted us and gave us great advice for our order. Better yet, the food is awesome! Definitely will be back for more."}
{"text":"Found this little gem today and I'm glad stopped here to give it a chance because it's pretty good! It's located next to this aikido place and a church so keep an eye out for it because you might miss it. 

Anyways, you can either have your food to go or dine in. I ordered a spider roll and the roll is pretty good size wise and as tasty as it looks. Too home a seaweed salad and the portion is very generous too. 

The staff here are friendly and love you tell you about the menu so if you have any questions they'll be sure to answer them for you.

Next time I would really like to try their boxes but I couldn't because I can't eat meat this week. :( I'll be back for you, Sushi Cafe!"}
{"text":"Nice casual sushi place for a quick lunch. I got the lemon roll, Alaska roll, and California roll. I loved the lemon roll, the others were ok. Great customer service. I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"The waitress was extremely rude to us and rushed us to decide when we were the only people there. 

We chose to check this place out, because it had good reviews. (I question the validity of their reviews now,). We chose to dine in at a time that wasn't busy, specifically to avoid the rush and go when it wouldn't be stressful for the staff. We were literally the only people there and the waitress STILL pressured us to choose what we wanted as soon as we sat down. She made it even worse, because when we said we needed a minute to decide she rolled her eyes at us. We just stood up and left after that. It was ridiculous. I don't know if that person was filling in for someone, or having a bad day, but we never prompted that kind of rude behavior. I will never go here again, because it was an awful experience. Learn some common courtesy and manners."}
{"text":"Hands down you cant find another place that gives you the same quality for the money sushi in Henderson. Always friendly, always quick, order is always correct. Everything is top quality (even the sashimi), but the lemon roll is insane and you MUST get it. Do yourself a favor and stop eating bad grocery store sushi when you are in a rush - go here!"}
{"text":"What a cute little cafe! A SUSHI cafe, even! 

I was a bit thrown off by how we order. I thought they'd sit you first but you have to order first, and if you're eating \"for here\", they'll tell you to sit and they bring your food to you, then you pay when you're done eating. The only menu I saw were boards on the wall so it was hard to see what I was ordering. There were just names and I didn't know what was in any of the rolls. I had to depend on Yelp (thank you!). 

Service was great, though! The cashier/waitress was very friendly. The wait for our food wasn't too bad either. 

I ordered a combo bowl. I was hesitant about the price (~$12) but when I saw what was actually included in my bowl, I understood why. I got raw salmon, spicy tuna, surimi crab, seaweed salad, masago, avocado, ginger, rice, some greens, and probably other things that were hidden under everything else. I enjoyed by food and was happy to be bringing home leftovers. 

The price for a roll is pretty affordable and two rolls can fill you up. I'd definitely come here for rolls if I don't want to spend so much on AYCE. ~$4.50 for nigiri may be pushing it, so I'll probably do AYCE somewhere else for that."}
{"text":"I have been here three times and every time I got exactly what I expected.  Fast friendly service at a great price. The sushi is great for the price. Definitely not a date night place but for a quick bite to eat you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I waited to leave this review. The last 4 orders have been disappointingly smaller, eel was chewy, uncooked. The rolls used to be quality and bigger pirtions and they have gotten much smaller. I wont be returning anymore. :("}
{"text":"This place is super good value. Fresh, fresh sushi for so cheap! It's definitely a hidden gem near University and Front Street. Perfect for a cheap lunch. Look for the red quartz building."}
{"text":"Loved it! I ordered the Bar B q with Sushi box. It was fresh and delicious. I will be going back soon. They deliver too"}
{"text":"Fresh and quick.  Very good food.  Love it!  The had a Poke Bowl on special that came with 8 oz of sushi!"}
{"text":"Great food for a great price. It's kinda tucked away in a strip mall, behind Auto Zone. Definitely a hidden gem."}
{"text":"I'm glad Sushi Cafe opened up! We could use more Asian restaurants on Stephanie St! The cafe itself is clean and quiet. The service was really fast, which I really enjoyed since other sushi restaurants take forever just to get take out sometimes! The employees were very kind as well.

I tried the Salmon Roll which was fresh and simple. I've also tried the Monster Box with the Bulgogi roll that comes with 5 pieces of sushi, seaweed salad and goroke. It was a decent amount of food that will not make you overly full! I love the variety as well!"}
{"text":"This is now our go-to spot for take out sushi and boxes because the prices are completely affordable and they're fast, damn fast, like Usain Bolt fast. This is perfect for your time constrained lunches or if you're too hungry and don't want to sit in a restaurant and wait.

I've ordered take out three times. Once through Eat24 and the other two times, I called in. I tried to get there before my order was finished the last time I called and I couldn't beat them. The quality wasn't sacrificed despite the speed with neatly made rolls and fresh fish with every order. I usually get the poke or a box and the rest of the family will split a bunch of basic rolls. The boxes have plenty of food which include rice, egg, seaweed salad, and korroke (potato croquette).The food has been good every time with the only slip up being the rice being too wet and mushy with one order. But in the end, you'll be pleased with the amount of food you get for the price you pay.

There can be a little bit of a language barrier if you call in your order. There's plenty of seating if you decide to eat there. The restaurant is clean with an open kitchen. And all of the guys working there are super friendly. They repeat the order completely before you leave and they had no issue abiding by my request for extra ginger after the order was finished. I didn't have the bow count meter on when I last stopped in, but I think I hit about 6 bows to the fine gentleman at the register when I last picked up my order."}
{"text":"I dined in the other day. Very impressed with the quality of the sushi and the service! It's a small place and if you want to eat there, they will seat you and wait on you. While I was there at least 5 people came in to pick up to-go orders. I was a little confused with all the menus on the walls and the daily specials so I just ordered from the menu that they gave me and I wasn't disappointed. I ordered a tiger roll, seaweed salad and an iced green tea. Came up to about $12. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"This is the best sushi you can pay for at its price. I have grown to learn that the owner is an incredibly accommodating man, and the sushi is always impeccably fresh. I highly recommend you stopping by for a quick bite if you haven't already, and giving the green dragon and avocado roll a try. It's an amazing restaurant, and I have become a regular. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"The quality of the fish is great and the combos are reasonably priced. I usually get the monster box and the jackpot roll (my fave)! This is a great place to go for sushi when you don't feel like eating ayce but still need to satisfy your cravings."}
{"text":"I really love this sushi spot, especially since it's on the other side of my fence for my house. It is a hidden gem Tucktaway in a shopping center. The quality is so amazing and the price is absolutely perfect! It is a cute, family owned restaurant and definitely a place that I go to often"}
{"text":"Ordered take out for four people.  I ordered platter #1, a tuna poke box and a korean bbq box.  You definitely get a lot of food for the price, but I was not a big fan of the sushi rice.  They use a combo of brown rice and white rice...and it just makes the texture a little off putting.  I wish they offered just a normal sushi rice option.  Also, the Korean bbq box looked a lot like the bulgogi box for some reason.  The meat was in little pieces unlike the picture they have depicted.  Overall not a bad fast food sushi/bento option but nothing really special either."}
{"text":"I love Japanese cuisine. In particular, I really like sushi. In this place they are able to cook perfectly. The prices for sushi and friendly staff were very good."}
{"text":"A hidden gem! The fish is really good quality especially for the price. I ordered the salmon fish bowl, it's basically a poke bowl with all the helpings. Seaweed salad, rice, cucumber, spicy tuna, LOTS of spicy mayo (so order it less or without if you don't like spicy mayo so much), and half a pound of salmon!! So good, and very good price. We also got a \"sushi burrito\" which they call the monster roll meal. Also wonderful. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"This was such a nice place to stop by for lunch. 

I ordered the salmon bowl and the dragon roll, and they were both so fresh and satisfying. This was my first time having a sushi bowl, and it was delicious. A little spicy, but very tasty. 

I love that their menu is simple. A lot of sushi restaurants lately are constantly trying to one-up the competition by making these crazy, special rolls- which are still delicious- but it's nice to tone it down every now and then and just let the fresh fish speak for itself."}
{"text":"It is amazingly tasty with reasonable prices! I ordered bowl for my self and my friend order a sushibox, we are both satisfied with our choice. iam going to miss this place once i go back to chicago, two tumbs up!"}
{"text":"Hmmmm. If I did this review back during my first visit, it would be 5 stars.. but they've changed..

About a year ago, a Monster Box was a Sushi burrito, 4 pieces of Nigiri, and 2 potstickers for $9.99.. Fast forward to about 6 months ago, and the sushi burrito was $9.99 alone, with the Monster box coming in at $13 or so. That's cool. Inflation. I come in 2 weeks ago, and asked for the Monster Box. The lady who's ALWAYS at the register (more on her later), said they don't have that anymore, but she'll \"hook me up with it as a special.\" She rang me up. Came to over $16. She just charged me regular prices for all 3 items. That THREE price changes in less than a year. Not cool. Not consistent.

Back to the lady. I understand she has to sell people on their product but she's literally borderline harassing. Twice in the past few months, me and my ex visited and she pushes and pushes and pushes their special rolls. Even after you tell her no, not interested, she walks by asking, \"Are you sure?\" ...and even walked someone else's special roll past us to show us. We finally ordered it to shut her up. It was AMAZING! ..but that's besides the point. I eat sushi all over the country. Never am I pressured EVERY time I go. Even when ordering the Monster Box to go, she tries to get you to get the special. It's really annoying.

Will I be back? Yep. I'm leaving here right now actually. Would I come a lot more if they had consistent pricing and the lady at front had a muzzle? Absolutely.

Also: Call ahead. Twice in the past year, they were closed without notice, even though Store Hours sign said open.."}
{"text":"The restaurant is clean and pretty, and the employees were nice. The food is priced well and tasted great! I got a cali roll and spicy crab roll w/ side of edamame. It's nothing super special or different, but it's made well and it's a really clean environment which is important to me when eating sushi! They also have some random Japanese chips, drinks, snacks, etc. in the store. The chocolate panda cookies are good."}
{"text":"Yummy sushi - I was expecting it to be more of a restaurant but the place is small and only has a few tables. However, everything we had was fresh and tasty. I LOVED my tempura shrimp rollito. It is a sushi burrito :) also the lemon roll was super good and refreshing - perfect for this hot weather. Will come back :)"}
{"text":"Perfect sushi, perfect prices! Salmon and yellowtail sashimi was super delicious and their rolls are huuuuge! Can't beat the prices either. Very happy we found this spot to satisfy our sushi cravings."}
{"text":"We went here for the first time. We ordered the Salmon monster box, scallops sashimi, BBQ monster box and spider roll. The food was excellent and very fresh. The customer service was excellent.  They very patient and polite. We will be coming here for sure in the near future. I give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"Worst place to eat, ordered a sushi burrito yesterday around 230pm & spent the evening throwing up. Not sure if the salmon was bad or the sauces, just know I spent the night sick. I can't even eat anything today, please beware. I will never go back."}
{"text":"Food is great at this place. Descent price and the quality of food is great. Used to be open on Sundays but they are now closed on this day."}
{"text":"We ordered the bulgogi box, Spicy Monster roll monster box, and spicy rainbow roll. Everything was amazing! The tuna was good portions and fresh. There was quite a bit of meat in the bulgogi box. It also included some tasty crunchy korokke. Portions were perfect on everything. Will come again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! The prices are incredible for what you get; I couldn't believe the sizes of the rolls for the price here. Always wonderful service and the rolls are outstanding! So happy to have found Sushi Cafe"}
{"text":"Hidden gem in Henderson. Their poke bowls are delicious and served with large portions of fish. Good food, friendly service. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi great prices. Cool little spot. I recommend the monster sushi roll simply delicious."}
{"text":"I really enjoy their food. I've come here numerous times and tried their monster boxes and sushi. Great service and great food and prices"}
{"text":"I was very pleased with the prices along with the food. My first visit was perfect. However, my second visit was a bit unpleasant because I was on lunch break and due to slow service, I had only 10 minutes to eat my food. My only piece of advice would be to be super attentive to those dining in. Taking their order as soon as they say they are ready to order and getting those orders in asap because some people are limited on time."}
{"text":"Yummmm I love this place for a quick bite of sushi and the staff is very pleasant and attentive. Check them out,  they're a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Good little spot. Simple menu and fairly priced. I got the tuna monster box and it's worth every penny. Just enough to fill me up. I will be back on Monday."}
{"text":"My family was looking for a sushi place for dinner,  we didn't want AYCE or go far from home,  I stumbled across Sushi Cafe. We were extremely impressed. The food was amazingly fresh, the flavors bold and the service was pleasant. The cost can't be beat, we left satisfied and for half of what all you can pay for a family of 4 at AYCE. I will be coming back!!!"}
{"text":"This is an amazing sushi spot in Henderson! I highly recommend! Also the service is amazing! :-)"}
{"text":"The BBQ beef lunch box was an excellent choice, 5 stars for having a good amount of lean meat and a little bit of everything to compliment the meal.  It came with seaweed salad, sweet fried potatoes pieces, white fluffy rice, pickled garlic and what not and all for under $10.  

The sushi rolls, were not so good here for me.  I had the spicy tuna roll and was it an overload of sodium.  I guess they haven't gotten the mixture of spiciness against the salt ratio down pack. It was major turn off, so it made the rest of my perception of this place go from oh I can totally do this drive for this food to never mind.  I can't imagine what their poke would taste like if they can't even mix spicy tuna.  The up side to it all, the fish is good and the price is probably a pretty good price point.  The sushi rolls weren't good at all, but the nigiri such hamachi, tuna and salmon weren't bad for $2.95 a set.  

For me, the box all the way if I would come back for a 3rd visit."}
{"text":"Pro price was great around 7
Con reading the reviews had high expectations but the sushi was regular tasting."}
{"text":"Can I just state that I love this little sushi cafe and I hope they never close down. This is the perfect cheap, fast food type sushi place to go to. I've been there a couple of times now and they've never disappointed. They do pick up through the phone and Yelp, dine in, and to go. I've done all four and definitely had great experiences every time. Their customer service is pretty awesome and their prices are really good for the quality. Make sure you grab the lemon roll, which comes with ponzu sauce (YUM!) and the salmon nigiri. Good portions, fresh fish, and fast/awesome service. 5 stars for me!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for lunch after a few friends recommended it. I ordered the cucumber hosomaki, avocado hosomaki, and the spider roll. Im sorry to say the only thing that wasn't bad was the cucumber hosomaki. Its kind of surprising that they would serve under-ripe avocado that was as hard as a rock. The spider roll was pretty disappointing too because it also included the rock hard avocado and the crab appears to be the regular imitation kind rather than an actual soft-shell crab. Im really disappointed because I work kind of close and was hoping this could be my regular sushi spot - but messing up an avocado roll?"}
{"text":"After reading a few of the reviews I decided to take my little brother who was visiting in to try some sushi. He is super picky like me but I knew we would find some stuff we both liked. When we walked in there was only one person who had ordered takeout. It was on a Monday around 2pm. The host was very welcoming and told us to sit where ever we liked. We took our seats and started looking at the menu. They have a pretty good variety of items at a really decent price. Our waitress/host came back to take our drink order, we both ordered fountain drinks which we could have poured ourselves but she insisted on doing it for us. When she brought our drinks over she asked my brother to taste his because it looked flat. It was indeed so she instead brought him over a canned soda. I felt that was a step above what most places would do. We ended up ordering an appetizer and 4 rolls. Everything was absolutely amazing! The rolls were perfect and tasted so fresh. The service was great and the price could not be beat. In CA my husband and I had a place we would go to regularly and never left paying under $40 (not including tip) our order was pretty similar to what my brother and I ordered here. The price we paid at Sushi Cafe was only $22.95 (again not including tip) that is a huge price difference for basically the same meal! I am totally going to bring my husband here! If you like quality food and good service you need to check this place out."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying the first three times we went here, they would have gotten a five star review. Food was fantastic. Server was friendly. Recently, though, I have been having issues getting the phone answered. Yesterday was date night and we were looking forward to sushi. Called. No answer. Decided to go in person. There was a sign on the door \"break time 4-5:30.\" Ok. I can wait 40 minutes. I called 7 times from 5:30-6 with no answer. This is really poor customer service and I just don't feel good about giving them my business anymore. Really disappointed because their OMG roll really was OMG."}
{"text":"I  have been there twice for take out orders. The people are always willing to help, it didn't take long to get my food and the rolls I had were EXCELLENT both tines. When I got there the second time, some of the workers were having dinner. As soon as my order was finalized,  they got up from their meals to put mine together! That really impressed me!
There's really nothing negative I could say about the place!"}
