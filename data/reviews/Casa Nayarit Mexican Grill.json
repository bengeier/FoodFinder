{"text":"Simple tasty authentic Mexican food in Bethel Park. This unassuming little building hides one of the areas hidden food gems. My father and I both had the Burritos Mexicanos...
Think Chipotle burrito but made fresh  (and tasted way better) and toped with guacamole, salsa, cheese, and sour creamThe beef inside tastes like it was a slow cooked barbecue of the highest quality. It had just enough if a tang to to be satisfying but not quite spicy. My dad enjoyed two hot sauces at the table, one hot and one EXTREMELY hot.

Service was friendly and helpful in understanding the HUGE menu. Being unused to many Mexican food terms the glossary in the back was helpful
(But I have a feeling anything you order here is going to be amazing)

They don't have a liquor license yet, but it's BYOB!

Anyways, I have a new favorite local restaurant! I think I'll be back in a few weeks for dinner."}
{"text":"The most accurate way to describe Casa Nayarit is a somewhat authentic Mexican restaurant which takes many liberties with the Pittsburgh palate.  Judging from their true Mexican dishes Casa Nayarit deserves more than 3 stars, however, the compromised menu drops their authenticity and limits their overall rating in my mind.  

Here is my candid review:  

The legitimate authenticity in part:  decor, price point, their salsas (tomatillo is roasted and amazing though their roja is way too mild - catering to the area), dishes such as bistec a la mexicana, ttampiquena, molcajete, camerones diablo, carnitas verde, carnitas ranchero, carne asada, enchiladas verde, tacos de pescada, huevos a la mexicana, & the friendly native language Spanish employees and more. I wonder why they do not serve mole other than perhaps the chefs are not from Oaxaca (hence the Nayarit name) and they don't want to sell the amazing sauce short of its true glory. 

The standard Americanized liberties:  flour tortillas as the default option, giant burritos (burritos are not a true Mexican dish but places like Juarez and Sinoloa will serve a version due to the blurring Tex Mex lines in Northern Mexico), hard shell tacos, having to ask for lime wedges, lettuce and cheese as taco toppings (that is a BIG no-no, they should at least give customers a Mexican option with cilantro, onion and tomatillo sauce), no Jarritos, cheese smothered refried beans rather than true black or pinto beans, tortillas with melted cheese dip, as well as some other things on their menu.  

All in all, Casa Nayarit is a mid-Atlantic Mexican restaurant who must make financial ends meet hence the mostly understandable decisions to cater to all clientele.  They do a very good job, mostly, in using fresh, quality ingredients while trying to balance some of their root cuisine with a heavy Tex-Mex influence and food American palates are accustom to eating.  Their quality of food has always been excellent even when some of the flavors have been on the mild side.  I have been a customer around 30 times and ordered a large part of their menu. I have left pleased with taste of their dishes much more often than not. I wish they would add more spice to some of their traditional, authentic, genuine Mexican dishes, though. Having written that, they do have more than their share of the Hispanic community who eat in their restaurant.  That community seems to order a Molcajete.  It is an amazingly tasty, super flavorful, unique dish made in their own certain way served in a traditional molcajete.

For the most part, if you want AUTHENTIC, KNOW what you are ordering, and are very specific you can be very pleased. If you think you know authentic and order chips with cheese or a fajita burrito you will still be happy because the quality will be good. If you just want Americanized Mexican they have a place on the menu for you too. This is a nice, semi authentic restaurant (but please add soft corn tortillas as standard) on the verge of taking too many Tex Mex chances which distance themselves from their true Mexican roots. 

Food comparable to:  El Campesino with a more home style but less authentic feel. Recommended but YMMV."}
{"text":"This is a family favorite- we have been here often since it opened.  My favorite dish is the carne asada tacos, but everything I've tried has been great.  My son is a fan of the Taquitos Mexicanos, and my husband loves every shrimp dish they have.  The service is fantastic, and we love that it is BYOB."}
{"text":"Just discovered this place today and decided to check it out. Definitely do not judge a book by it's over. Walking in, it was a great atmosphere. This place is BYOB, no need to elaborate any further. Our waiter was very attentive and for how busy it was, we were filled up with our chips/drinks as soon as they were running low. The food was fantastic. I was beyond satisfied with the taste and the portion for the price. We will definitely become regulars at this place."}
{"text":"My favorte local Mexican restaurant!!  My favorite is the \"chili Colorado\"!!  Everything on the menu is tasty and authentic. Fast good service"}
{"text":"This small restaurant is defiantly a diamond in the rough. Outside does need a lil work, but the staff was great. Very good customer service and very friendly. The inside does have a couple flat screens for local sports.
Above all else the food is amazing. Everyone at my table throughly enjoyed their meal. Also this place has the best salsa in town! 

I defiantly recommend stoping by to check it out. Prices are very good as well. You get your money's worth for sure.
As stated they do not have a liquor license yet but it is BYOB."}
{"text":"UPDATE:  I was not able to log in to YELP so I had to create a new account.  Here is my candid, honest UPDATED Casa Nayarit review:

The most accurate way to describe Casa Nayarit is a somewhat authentic Mexican restaurant which takes many liberties with the Pittsburgh palate.  Judging from their true Mexican dishes Casa Nayarit deserves at least 3 stars, however, the noticeably compromised menu with many mild, bland dishes drops their authenticity and limits their overall rating in my mind.  

The legitimate authenticity in part:  decor, price point, their salsas (tomatillo is roasted and very, very good though their roja is way too mild - catering to the area), dishes such as bistec a la mexicana, tampiquena, molcajete, camerones diablo, carnitas verde, carnitas ranchero, carne asada, enchiladas verde, tacos de pescada, huevos a la mexicana, & the friendly native language Spanish employees and more.

The standard Americanized liberties:  flour tortillas as the default option, giant burritos (burritos are not a true Mexican dish but places like Juarez will serve a version due to the blurring Tex Mex lines in Northern Mexico), hard shell tacos, no lime wedges, lettuce and cheese as taco toppings (that is a BIG no-no, they should at least give customers a Mexican option with cilantro, onion and radish), no Jarritos, cheese smothered over a lot of their food,  tortillas with melted cheese dip, as well as some other things on their menu.  

All in all, Casa Nayarit is a mid-Atlantic Mexican restaurant who must make financial ends meet hence the mostly understandable decisions to cater to all clientele.  They USED to do a very good job, mostly, in using fresh, quality ingredients while trying to balance some of their root cuisine with a heavy Tex-Mex influence and food American palates are accustom to eating. HOWEVER, as of late their food has been substandard taking MANY short cuts.  Also, their food's flavors are firmly on the mild side.  I have been a customer around 30 times and ordered a large part of their menu. I USED to leave pleased with taste of their dishes much more often than not though they are much, much more hit and miss (mostly miss) now. I still wish they would add more spice to some of their traditional, genuine Mexican dishes. Having written that, they do have more than their share of the Hispanic community who eat in their restaurant.  That community seems to order a Molcajete.  It is an amazingly tasty, super flavorful, unique dish made in their own certain way served in a traditional molcajete.  Its almost a cross between Texas fajitas and Mexico City's tampiquena.

For the most part, if you want AUTHENTIC, KNOW what you are ordering, and are very specific you may be pleased. If you think you know authentic and order chips with cheese or a fajita burrito you will still be happy because the quality for that kind of palate is generally pretty good. If you just want Americanized Mexican they have a BIG place on the menu for you too. This is a nice, semi authentic restaurant (but please add soft corn tortillas as standard) on the verge of taking too many Tex Mex chances which distance themselves from their true Mexican roots.

Food comparable to:  El Campesino but somehow with a more home style yet less authentic feel. Recommended but YMMV."}
{"text":"Compatible to west coast Mexican cuisine. The only tex-mex locally that I have had better than this is El Paso in  Calcutta Ohio. The service was above outstanding and for that I would give this Restraunt a 5."}
{"text":"Seriously good Mexican food with a friendly staff and great service.  I can't wait until the liquor license comes through.  I've tried lots of things but HIGHLY recommend the pina loca.   It is like a fajita in a pineapple.  Great mix of flavors."}
{"text":"Small unpretentious restaurants always seem to deliver - and Casa Nayarit did!!  We munched heartily on the crisp hearty chips and the smooth flavorful salsa while looking over their very diverse menu. There's fajitas, seafood, carne asada, carnitas, and combination plates galore.
I had the carne asada with a side of chili rellenos!!! LOVED the chili rellenos!!! So good that I ordered 3 to go!!! The carne asada was good - but just wasn't as flavorful as others I've enjoyed- and missing grill marks too. The guacamole was good as were the beef tacos and enchiladas. We brought with us our own margaritas and really enjoyed our meal!! Service was great and very attentive. Loved the typical low key atmosphere with serapes and sombreros on the wall- delighted too with a large picture window in the back letting in natural light. The bench seats were very comfortable and not worn out as many are. I was delighted when I got home and in my bag with my chili rellenos was a bag of chips, a small container of salsa and extra sauce for my rellenos!!! The extra sauce seemed spicier than what was on the one I had with dinner - a great surprise!! We'll be back!! Just wish it were closer to us!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent home style Mexican food. Great service, simple atmosphere, BYOB and amazing food. What else can you ask for? 
Me and my wife had Authentic Chile Rehlanos and Shrimp Diavalo.  We enjoyed both. I would go there again and again. Great little hidden gem in Bethel park"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places. It's a great lunch and dinner destination. The food is fantastic and the staff is friendly and efficient. The whole family loves to eat there even my picky little one."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant  because it was new to area but when I walked in all the employees were sitting down eating, they got up and sat me. The tortilla were great but salsa seen like it can from a jar.I order a burrito it was extremely small for $6, but I may try again but first impression was not good at all."}
{"text":"I badly wanted to love it here. Bethel park doesn't have a single good restaurant, let alone Mexican food. 
Pros: I ordered the special texas. The chimichanga was good. But the quesadilla was sitting in a pool of watery green liquid that completely ruined it, and turned the tortilla into a mass of goo. Blah! Otherwise, it would've been pretty decent. 

The chips and salsa were standard, nothing special. 

Someone ordered fatitas. They give an enormous skillet of meat. Easily enough for 3 (or two very large appetite portions).  
The kids menu is the best bargain. $3.99 gets you a taco, quesadilla, and fries. Not bad. The 3 year old ate more than I did. 

The prices are decent. 6 adults and a child for around $90.00. 

Cons: they're not set up to handle more than one party bigger than 4. It's almost all 4 person booths.

The mess under our booth was...disturbing. I won't post the picture, but trust me when I tell you to keep your eyes above the table. I'm still not sure what I saw...but I'm hoping it was a piece of beef, and not what it looked like...

3 people out of 6 were not feeling well in the middle of the night.  It'll be quite a while before I crave Mexican food again.  :("}
{"text":"Heard the food here was good . Ordered takeout which was an adventure as they only have 1 phone line and when I did get thru they asked Me to hold and set the phone down for 5 minutes I head everything going on then they hung up. Decided to just go there and order . They were fairly busy but not crowded food only took 20 minutes to cook. Got home to eat the food was soggy and lacked much taste so not impressed. Will give it another try at some point since they are new but will eat in next time."}
{"text":"I hope people keep coming here because everything in this spot goes outta business.  Great prices.  Food is excellent.  Although, in my opinion, the combination plates and lunch isn't as good as ordering from the sections labeled chicken, beef, seafood, etc.  Free chips and salsa with meal and it's unlimited.  Bring your own bottle.  Only minor complaint is the menu is too big and confusing.  I think some of the lesser ordered items could be taken off.  Voy a terminar aquí"}
{"text":"This is my favorite mexican restaurant. Everything is very good, and they are fast. My only complaint is that the quality varies a little bit, but that is probably to be expected when it is house made by a variety of cooks."}
{"text":"Service was great! BYOB for now. The food was spot-on as far as authentic Mexican. The nachos with cheese was delicious, the nachos were baked with the cheese melted on top. So yummy. We ordered fajitas, large portions and inexpensive. The only downside is their parking situation but would definitely return."}
{"text":"Great food & service! BYOB is great. They give you margarita glasses with salt & ice."}
{"text":"Nice little place. Food and service were good. I had the chicken chimi, nice size portion and very tasty. My husband had the jumbo burrito, it was huge. I would go back."}
{"text":"Five stars HAPPY!!!!!   Having just returned from the State of Nayarit, Mexico, I was delighted when a friend here in Pittsburgh told me of Casa Nayarit.  I couldn't wait to give it a try. In three words, I loved it. I walked in and asked the waiter in Spanish if he was from Tepic, capital of Nayarit state. He smiled and said he was from near there. I sat down, satisfied that Nayarit  was not just a named picked out of the air. 

The ambience felt very authentic, with Mexican channels showing futbol (soccer) on two flat screen TV's (in separate sections of the rather small restaurant.) Mexican prints are on the wall. Lots of Mexican restaurants look like a movie set of what Mexico is thought to look like. Casa Nayarit looks like a restaurant in Mexico that caters to locals. 

Started with chips and salsa. The homemade corn chips were excellent, 
(as were the tortillas with my main course, which I suspect were also homemade, though I forgot to ask.)  The sauce was not great but there were bottles of two different hot sauces on the table which took care of the situation just fine. 

For a main course I ordered shrimp with onion and green pepper. The shrimp were cooked to perfection. The vegetables were al dente and tasty. The dish came with rice and beans that were also delicious. I was reminded of the lunch I thoroughly enjoyed in Tepic, Nayarit, on May 1. I had no room for dessert so I can't help you there. I left totally happy and will return soon.

Please note that the only signage faces the side street from which there is no access to the restaurant. If you approach on South Park Road, it's the red building set back from a parking lot. ALSO NOTE THAT THE RESTAURANT IS CLOSED ON MONDAY, something I found out the hard way. As other reviewers have noted, it's BYOB, no license at least for now. 

I get the sense that every dish will be as great as the shrimp dish I had, and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Excellent, authentic Mexican that is consistently good.  We have been there numerous times and have ordered take out from them as well, and we are never disappointed."}
{"text":"Very fast service, very fresh tasting food, and a very reasonably priced menu. A bit shady looking from the outside, and the parking is less than ideal, but the food is totally worth parking across the street for."}
{"text":"All you need to know is order the Durango burrito!!  One of the best meals I have ever had"}
{"text":"Anyone who says this place is \"just not that good\", is loco en la cabeza.  I have tried like a 3rd of the menu at this point and am yet to be disappointed.  Since I found out about this place I have gone some weeks, multiple times.  It's delicious, the staff is super friendly and the food comes out quick.  Anyone that can find something to complain about this place wasn't hugged enough as a child."}
{"text":"A small but really wonderful restaurant.  Every thing we ordered was freash and extremely tasty.  The salsa is made in house.  We had the tamales with rice and beans. Outstanding and very recommend. 
The restaurant is BYOB."}
{"text":"This restaurant serves truly \"Authentic Mexican Food\" perfectly prepared. Their salsa (homemade) is out of this world.  They offer many lunch specials, and my wife and I have never found anything on their menu that wasn't the best prepared, presented and most tasty Mexican food we have ever eaten.   

We have often stopped in to get a pint or two of their salsa to go when we are having a party or tailgate, and everyone always comments on how great the salsa is and asks where we got it. They don't sell it bottled, you get it in a styrofoam container and it is half the price you would pay for some name brand bottled commercially produced salsa. I cannot recommend it enough.

They don't have a liquor license, so it is BYOB. Can't wait till they get a license so that we can enjoy a Margarita with our meal. 

We truly love this restaurant and stop in there every chance we get. IT IS THAT GOOD!"}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food in the South Hills! They have a solid sized menu with lots of great options. I will definitely be going back to try more!  The staff was very nice and quick.  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Coming from eating at places local to where I lived like Cozumel in Greensburg and Gran Agave in Homestead this is average. The atmosphere is below average, they don't serve alcohol. salsa average, parking is a pain, and the food is average. The service was good or slightly above average. We were so looking forward to a good Mexican place close to Upper St Clair.  S"}
{"text":"So nice to have an authentic Mexican restaurant in the South Hills! Charming atmosphere, friendly & quick service, delicious & hot food for the price! Starter was free warm chips and salsa. I had Shrimp Chimichangas, and they were loaded with hot grilled shrimp, sweet peppers and tomatoes rolled in a crunchy fried tortilla. Topped with sour cream, fresh guacamole, lettuce and tomato, served with refried beans - delicious!! Hubby had a combo plate of one beef and one chicken chimi, and it was also delicious. Recommended, and we will be back!!"}
{"text":"The food was good enough.  I did have a chicken bone (not a tiny one either) in my quesadilla so that was a little disappointing, but it happens.  Our big problem was that our waitress brought the bill and credit card to our table that actually belonged to the couple at the table next to us.  She never brought our bill but handed us someone else's credit card.  I'd call that a huge problem.  My husband looked at it expecting it to be our bill, saw a credit card, and before he could say anything, she was gone.  We straightened it out ourselves, exchanged conversation with the couple, and waited for our bill.  Fifteen minutes later...nothing.  My husband actually had to get up, find the waitress, and ask for our bill.  She laughed it off when she realized that she gave us the other peoples credit card and said, \"Oh, that's funny.\"  No, not really.  I would maybe go back but I would never pay with a credit card."}
{"text":"This place is awesome - both food and staff. Menu is extensive and we actually like the fact that it's BYOB. Not sure why other people stand in line for a Mexican place that costs as much, if not more, and doesn't give you free chips and salsa. Food is authentic. Dined in several times and never disappointed."}
{"text":"Food is very good. Servings have gotten smaller since they first opened. A few times we got takeout and had to wait ten or fifteen minutes longer than when the food was supposed to be ready. Still my go to for Mexican food"}
{"text":"The food here is great, portions are big l, and it is priced well. I love that it's BYOB and it is well located for people in its surrounding areas. If you bring tequila they will make the rest of the margarita for you. I've been waiting for something I like to go in that space for so long and finally I think this one is here to stay."}
{"text":"Their food and service were ok, having eaten at their sister restaurants in Bridgeville and Allequipa I can honestly say I their food want the best. However compared to other Mexican, this place is heads above the rest. Decor could really use some work tho."}
{"text":"This is the best authentic Mexican food I have ever had. The service was great and the food was A++++."}
{"text":"Excellent!!! Why did it take so long for me to dine here? Very authentic.Glad to see so far it has escaped the curse of the corner of Church St and South Park Rd. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"I stopped into Casa Navarit while on a business trip thanks to the positive reviews on Yelp. I'm a huge fan of the chimichanga, so when I saw they had these with shrimp, I didn't need to read any further on the menu. It was a great choice! Absolutely delicious. So good, in fact, that I decided to treat myself to a bowl of fried ice cream. Also worth the price of admission. 

The service was fast and attentive. I highly recommend this restaurant. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I've never eaten in the restaurant so this is solely about take out. The food is great. I like the burritos and the pork is just spicy enough without being hard to eat. They don't overload it with too much rice and beans as filler. The pico is good and the orders come with chips and salsa. 

I saw that the website hints at online ordering is coming soon which would alleviate any of the headache that is calling in a takeout order. Frankly, wherever they are answering the phone is just super loud and as a result, it's always hard to hear on both ends of the phone. It has caused a delay or mix up of orders in the past, but that hasn't deterred me as of yet. It is a quality, local, non-chain restaurant nearby that I am happy to support."}
{"text":"You can tell the owner cares about this place as he is waiting tables and helping everyone as needed. The food was nothing to write home about unfortunately. The price is right, and I like to support local business, so I would try it again since I haven't been here in about a year now."}
{"text":"Great food, great service but nothing fancy about this hole in the wall. 
I ordered the chimichangas and they were full of flavor. The beans were okay but I usually prefer rice. 
The desserts of deep fried ice cream were fabulous as mine had a honey, sugary crust and the wifes just a plain shell."}
{"text":"Great food, OK ambiance, good service, not expensive and good portion sizes. Will visit again."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places for Mexican food. Their staff if very friendly and service id very good/prompt. This place is BYOB. A nice hidden gem."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican restaurant in South Hills! Clean and pleasant atmosphere. Great service.  The owner spoke Spanish with us and modified a menu item to meet my wife's request. Everything was fresh tasting, well prepared and served quickly. 

We can definitely recommend the carnitas!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Restaurant was very clean. We even noticed them cleaning the menus. 

We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Oh how the mighty have fallen!  We've been coming here since the place opened a year and half or so ago.  Maybe it's been a little longer.  

We went this evening, May 4, 2016 and were happy to see a mostly full restaurant.  We ordered our usual queso dip and \"Fajitas Valarta\" for 2.  The first sign something was a little off was the queso.   I commented that it was runny.  Ok, maybe it's just the way the batch was made, move on, right?

Next the fajitas for 2 came out sizzling just like it always does.  This time however, the plate featured LOTS of peppers and onions sizzling and little else.  There were 5 or so shrimp, like always, but very little in the way of beef or chicken.  Very little.  

I actually called the waiter over and asked if this is how the dish is made now.  He said that they have cut the portions but it did seem small.  He took it to the kitchen and was quickly turned around.  He apologized and said that this is how the dish is now served.  We said ok and just stared at it - stuck in that moment where you decide if you're going to take one for the team and eat or roll.  We decided we'd eat and just not return, lesson learned.  However, as I sat there for another minute or two I was so disgusted that I decided to portion out the chicken and beef.  In doing so we determined we had about 2oz of chicken and maybe 2 oz of beef to go with our 5 shrimp.  This is for a \"fajitas for 2\" combo, mind you.  I should have taken a picture of the beef and chicken separated out but the waiter took it back before I thought to do it.  He again apologized and we politely told him we wouldn't be back if this is the new reality.

I'm thinking that without the revenue a liquor license would generate that the Casa can't make the margins they need to survive.  It's a pity because it was previously a nice place considering the quality of the food and portions.  Take that away though and you have just another restaurant operator trying to pull the wool over your eyes.  Hasta La Vista, Casa Nayarit."}
{"text":"The food was okay. I ordered a vegetarian platter with a chalupa, spinach burrito and spinach quesadilla. The quesadilla used American cheese. The spinach was either from a can or frozen. I just wasn't wowed by the meal."}
{"text":"I can't pass up an invite to grab some Mexican food and this place did not disappoint. The decor isn't anything to write home about but that's fine with me. Took note that the sign on the door says BYOB. We were immediately greeted by a friendly server. He noticed that we had an infant with us and grabbed us a high chair. I brought my indecisive mother along who was taking her sweet time reading the menu. He was very patient with us and provided fast and friendly service. While chatting and enjoying some chips and salsa I noticed how welcoming the environment Is. The staff were all in an upbeat mood which can really add more to a dining experience. Several people had come in with their own alcohol and were having a good time. You can tell this is a favorite spot in the area. The parking lot was starting to fill up quickly. Our food was very flavorful. I hate going to locations where everything tastes the same and bland. I got the fajita burrito which was huge and delicious. Forgot to snap a picture before devouring most of it. Also sampled the Chile Verde (my fave) Chile Relleno and Azteca Burrito. The Chili Verde was not spicy to me but the flavors were on point. The menu has many options which is great for vegetarians or others who are picky eaters. Also note to be cautious getting in and out of the parking lot. The road it's on is pretty busy and people come zipping by."}
{"text":"I've driven by this place a million times, not even batting an eye. Decided to stop in today. Food was so good! Service was great, everyone was very nice. I really liked my chicken chimichangas (I'm not a fan of guacamole, but theirs is so fresh, I've never had anything like it), and the rice was tasty. The sopapillas were delicious, but I think my favorite thing was the appetizer queso fundido. Creamy dip with a little kick, served with warm soft tortillas. I would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about this place!! BYOB is awesome, and if you bring your own tequila, they'll make you margs! Food is authentic and delicious! So happy that something is finally doing well in this location! Buen Provecho!"}
{"text":"I ate here last night with my family. I had a salad which was small for the cost. Tasted okay. Everyone else ordered huge dinners which consisted of carnitas, fajitas, enchiladas, etc... They mostly complained about the tortillas being extremely gummy in texture and the salsa was very acidic, like it had gone bad. Today they are all sick. I am not sure how they are getting all these great reviews. The food was mediocre at best and prices were about average. The layout inside was weird and seemed shady. There was a disgusting mess under one of our booths. I won't be going back here again."}
{"text":"Good food. Super affordable. Excellent and friendly service. Def the best \"real Mexican(ish)\" that I've found in the South Hills Village. BYOB for now. If you bring your own tequila, they will make you a pretty awesome margarita. I'll def be back."}
{"text":"Our 2nd visit and brought our teenage son along. Great chips and homemade salsa, great portions, food is delicious and priced right. Couple that with the fast and friendly service you've got a gem of a Mexican restaurant tucked away in the South Hills.  Oh we'll be back promise!"}
{"text":"Don't let the outside turn you away. The foots was great. Try the big Texas would deff come back."}
{"text":"Wow, what a great meal! I had the Pollo Adobe which is a thin but large chicken breast under a wonderful mixture of spinach, green bell pepper, mushrooms, tomatos, and probably other good veggies.  It also comes with rice (very good!) and beans. On another plate you get three hot flour tortillas wrapped in foil.  Now, I am not sure if I should eat the tortillas fajita-style by putting my dinner into the tortilla or eat the tortilla separately the way you would eat garlic bread with spaghetti.  So I did both! (As a kid in So Cal, we would eat the hot tortillas with butter before the meal came, the way we have chips and salsa before the meal nowadays.)

Regardless of how I should eat it, it tasted great and I left nothing on my plate. Looking forward to next time!!

One thing to note: this place is byob."}
{"text":"This was our first time eating here, and it did not disappoint. The food was great, lots of vegetarian options. The place was so busy on a Wednesday night that we had a tough time finding parking, so we figured it would be good. The service was great - very nice people. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My Wife and I have been here 2 times in the last week. So far the food has been very good and the service has been friendly. I wish they had tortilla soup. The prices are very reasonable. My wife really likes their fried ice cream. Margaritas and Coronas would be a good addition also but not a deal breaker. We will be back soon. Nice place."}
{"text":"So my girlfriend and I  REALLY have a thing for Mexican food. We have spent much time abroad in Mexico, Chile, Argentina, Guatemala and Peru. We love Latin American culture and cuisine. It's our thing. So of course I have been searching a place close by that we can check out. Lo and behold, we found one of Bethel Parks hidden gems, Casa Nayarit.

Casa Nayarit lies tucked away on South Park Road in an inconspicuous little building which I'm pretty sure used to be some sort of rec center. As someone who has enjoyed Mexican cuisine so authentic it was literally in Mexico, this is authentic and absolutely delicious. I got chile rellenos, beans and rice. If you don't know what a chile relleno is, its basically a baked pepper stuffed with queso and smothered in sauce. They were so good! The only negative thing about this place is that they don't have their liquor license yet (soon!), but it is BYOB! I highly recommend this place to anyone who enjoys Mexican food."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner for the first time after having driven by dozens of times. We will definitely be back. The food was delicious!!  So fresh and hot!  My husband was planning to take half of his dinner home for later but before we knew it, his plate was clean. The staff was very friendly,as well. We really can't wait to go back!  Thank you for a delicious meal."}
{"text":"Food was average. Pretty much what you'd expect from a Mexican restaurant. The portions felt a little small, which results in my 4-star rating."}
{"text":"I get to be the first to Review Casa Nayarit! Bethel Park has lacked a Mexican Restaurant for a very long time. We have been eagerly waiting for it to open. They do not have their Alcohol license yet, but it's coming. We were greeted with warm chips and Salsa and ordered some white Queso. I had the #11 Combo(Beef Burrito, Enchilada and Taco), my wife had the Burrito Deluxe and my daughter had a Taco salad. Everything was delivered piping hot and was delicious. We were not disappointed. Service was great as well. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Really delicious food. I can finally stop going to Mad-Mex when I'm in the mood for a pork burrito. Had the burrito San Jose--awesome! love the cheese sauce.

Ambiance could use a shift, the room was really brightly lit and gives off a diner-like feel, which the restaurant is a few notches above at least. The acoustics are pretty terrible, sound bounces off the walls so even though the music isn't played loudly, its difficult to hear your tablemates over the din of conversations when the place is full. Service was fantastic and speedy with refills of drinks and chips. BYOB. We brought a bottle of wine and they uncorked it free of charge."}
{"text":"We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Casa Nayarit! The burrito was better than the enchilada, but both were good. The salsa was excellent and the chips were unsalted, which we enjoy. The service was great and the prices were vey reasonable. Please visit this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place does not look like much from the outside but the food was excellent and the wait staff was friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Food and price is great and ready really almost immediately but almost 45 minutes total time for a quick lunch special. Wait times to sit, order, and pay were the majority of the time spent."}
{"text":"Very average.

Looks divish from the outside, but the interior is bright and inviting.  Typical sombreros and mexican blankets on the walls.

I ordered the Chimichangas.  Very average taste, but dedinitely smaller than at most places.  Looked more like enchiladas.  Good guac and chips."}
{"text":"Very good authentic Mexican fare, great prices and excellent service!  And it is BYOB which is a definite plus."}
{"text":"My family and I go every single Wednesday. The food and service get better every single time. You got so much food for a great price. The staff are absolutely wonderful! Everyone needs to try the special dinner!"}
{"text":"Happy that this place is here! We went on a Sunday evening and gave this place a shot rather than our regular Mexican spot. Service was wonderful - very friendly staff. Our food came out quick and tasted great. Love all the vegetarian options. Also, kid and family friendly. Spacious, clean and easy to find. Parking in front, not sure where there is more parking. Decently priced. We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. Nice place to go, right here in Bethel Park. They need to redo the entrance and exterior to make it more inviting. And of course their liquor license."}
{"text":"The hubs and I were in the area to see about a tire pressure issue with the Mini. We were going to go to two nearby Consignment furniture stores afterwards but I started feeling a rumbling in my tummy and knew I needed to eat before checking out the furniture stores. We went on YELP and this restaurant came up. It was literally 2 minutes from where we were. 
We saw the sign but then saw the building. The sign said OPEN but it didn't look like it. My husband tried the door and it opened so he went in. There was a second set of doors. You still are feeling a little iffy but once you open the second door you see the signs of a Mexican restaurant-sombreros. 
We were seated quickly. The place was about half full. The menu offered over 20 Lunch options. While we were checking out the menu our server brought us complimentary chips and salsa. You know how sometimes a little thing can make a big difference?? Well they don't bring you a bowl of salsa. They bring a small carafe of salsa and an empty bowl to pour it into. I love this idea because you don't waste salsa. I hate  when people waste food. A lot of times people will barely touch their bowl of salsa and it just gets pitched. This small gesture eliminates waste. (Hopping off my soapbox now).
I had ordered a chicken burrito topped with cheese sauce. It came with sour cream, pico, and a guacamole dip. The chicken was shredded. It had been marinated and it was moist. There was also a side of rice. Sometimes rice can be served a little hard but this was cooked just right. I left a \"happy plate\" (meaning I cleaned my plate). I tried my husband's food-a chicken enchilada and a cheese enchilada. I really liked the enchilada sauce. I would definitely order enchiladas the next time I go in. 
We really enjoyed our lunch and we already know that we'll go back soon."}
{"text":"Great food with even better service. 

This is not the best Mexican I've ever had, but you will NOT be disappointed. The food is very good. Chips are hot and fresh. The salsa is great as is the white queso (not included). 

Our meals were above average (chicken chimichanga and spinach enchiladas) and our desert was amazing. Order the sopapillas! Cool little spot in Bethel Park. Worth checking out."}
{"text":"Passed by this place a few weeks ago and was intrigued - it looked like it might be better than the (sad) \"mexican\" places we've been to since moving here from the West Coast.  The place was crowded and surprisingly enough there were quite a few spanish-speakers, so it was a great sign that this place was worth a try.  The menu is quite extensive with favorites like chile colorado, chilaquiles, flan, carnitas, etc.  (No mole, though)  The salsa was good, and the chips were thick and warm, and the waiters were overloaded but quite nice.
I got the chile verde and my honey got the carnitas.  Mine was quite good and nicely spicy and his was not as good (we were expecting small char-grilled chunks instead of big simmered pieces) BUT with all the options on the menu we were quite delighted and excited about coming back.

That said, we felt completely MSG \"snowed\" afterward, and so will try it a couple more times to see if choosing something else will help.

But YES, I'd definitely recommend it as a really good option if you're tired of the bland places that serve french fries with their fajitas.  (You know who you are)"}
{"text":"This place is close to my house, so I was hoping it would be excellent, but it was \"meh\" at best. Chile Verde (normally my favorite dish) was underwhelming, with the sauce lacking fresh spices. It tasted almost too sour. The storefront is pretty uninviting as well, looking more like a dive bar than a Mexican restaurant, although I wouldn't have cared if the food was decent. Their service was prompt, but I don't know if I will go back."}
{"text":"BYOB. Chips and fresh salsa upon arrival with refills.  Got the kids quesadilla, fries and taco (#3) and the Parrillada Mexican for two. It was all really delicious. Service was fast as well."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food. Kind of a worn old building, but it reminded us of our favorite west coast Mexican restaurants so it added to the authenticity. Great service & the best Mexican food these So Cal transplants have had in the burgh. BYOB"}
{"text":"My wife and I get food here all the time. Great food!  I would highly recommend the queso fundido!  The guacamole is great and the BYOB is a plus. Don't let the outside fool you because the food is delicious"}
{"text":"Love this little gem. Food was authentic and incredibly good.  The menu has a wealth of choices and prices are really affordable.  We have been back a few times since our first visit and simply love this place.  If you're in the south hills you really should stop by and try this place out."}
{"text":"Very good Tex-Mex food and plenty of it.  And the excellent service is the cherry on the top.  Can't wait until their liquor license comes through and we can have margaritas with our meal.  The only negative, and it's really piddly, is that the sopapillas are really disappointing.  It seems like they just used some tortilla chips and put cinnamon sugar and whipped cream on them.  I'm used to puffy pillows of fried dough that you then drizzle honey on.  No worries, I didn't come for the dessert and we will definitely be regulars here!"}
{"text":"Friendly service.  Good prices.  About 12 booths and 4 or 5 tables.  There is a little bar area, not sure if it will be used or if they plan on getting a liquor license.  
The salsa and chips were good.  The chips were warm and the salsa had fresh cilantro.  The food came out fast.  Had the chicken burrito with rice.  The rice was good.  The chicken was in need of some seasoning."}
{"text":"Our \"go to\" place when we want Mexican food.  Authentic, family run place that's always busy.  Staff is friendly and the food is yummy!  I never turn down a chance to go here."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here 4 times and every single time the food, service, and price were phenomenal!! This is our new favorite place to eat!! They have amazing rice, beans, sweet tea, and we just ordered churros and fried ice cream ... :0"}
{"text":"I only come here for Mexican food ! Think it's the best and the people are super nice. Price are reasonable. My favorite is the Carnitas Dinner . The best !!! !!!!"}
{"text":"We had a Moms' Night Out here with a group of about 8-10 moms and had a wonderful time.  The food was very good, large portions, and reasonably priced.  We loved the BYOB and that they didn't charge a \"cork\" fee or give us any problems about it, especially when one mom brought a bag of supplies to make a specialty drink.   The only reason I did 4 stars instead of 5 was that our server didn't really come over much to check on us.  I had a diet coke and was always waiting a long time for refills. Overall we appreciated that they accommodated our group so well.

The parking lot is a little tight, but that wasn't a huge problem."}
{"text":"Sorry, but I was not impressed at all. The place has a very authentic atmosphere, but the food .. Not so much. After living in Arizona I know what good authentic Mexican food is, and this place missed it. I hope it was just a one-time bad experience. However, I won't be back to find out."}
{"text":"I had lunch with the family at Casa Nayarit today. This was my first time and it won't be the last. The restaurant is tucked away off South Park Drive and is on the smaller side, but the food is delicious. 

We had a table for 8. My choice was the Pollo con Crema and rice. The portions were generous but not too huge and everything was delicious. Service was lovely too. I think they rock the salsa world - I could eat the salsa and chips nonstop if left to my own devices. So very yummy!"}
{"text":"Great food, Friendly staff and Really Affordable!!!
I just found my new favorite restaurant. And there portions are really generous I have enough food left over to have a nice lunch tomorrow"}
{"text":"Chips & Salsa are very good and fresh.  Burrito superior is amazing.  Love the pulled chicken.  Queso is very tasty.  Really nothing here I ordered that I didn't enjoy."}
{"text":"Its not that the place is terrible, its just not that good.  There are so many better Mexican places to choose from this is one you can skip.

On the plus side, the chips and salsa were good and it isn't very expensive."}
{"text":"Wow what a great surprise!  Visiting Pittsburgh. Excellent lunch specials. Queso fundidto excellent!"}
