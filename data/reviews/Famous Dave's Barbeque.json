{"text":"Worst service I've had at a resturant in a long time.  If I could I would rate this lower than one star. Food was cold, I had to pull teeth to get a drink refill and my server was rude."}
{"text":"What an awful restaurant. Food was salty and pre cooked. I ordered a cheeseburger with no seasoning or salt and the waitress assured me that the meat is not pre seasoned, so thought I'd be safe. No. The meat was doused with so much salt I couldn't eat it. When I told the waitress about it, she insisted that nothing was added to the meat and asked if I would like her to take it away and offered no other solution to the problem. I can see why this place is empty at dinner time. Won't be coming back here ever again."}
{"text":"Ordered burgers medium well! They came out pink and bloody ! Gross  ..
The sever said yep, we're having a problem with the cook? Wtf ? If you know there's a problem how about fixing it once !? Mfers.."}
{"text":"Waited 10 min for a waiter to help us . The place was not busy. Waiter finally came by but walk out. Not sure if I'll be back"}
{"text":"Had a pretty bad experience here.  Took 10 min to get a soda at the bar, almost 20 to even order. Asked the bartender and the manager and the hostess to change the channel for us, no one could figure it out. While I like famous faves, I would not return to this location."}
{"text":"Portions are large, ribs are tender, sauces are flavorful and prices are fair.  I'm not sure what else you can ask for in a BBQ joint."}
{"text":"I use to like this place. I was disappointed when they serve us left over ribs. Meat was so tough, dry, didn't fall off the bone at all. It's like a bad beef jerky."}
{"text":"There's not a lot I can say about this place you shouldn't already know. Food is AMAZING!!! Staff is AMAZING!!! And the atmosphere is simply like being at home. This is going to be a go to for our family special dinners."}
{"text":"Slow service. Good ribs. OK chicken, fries tasted weird. Ignored by waiter while waiting for food. Probably won't go back, I like Lucille's better."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for over 2 years. Today is seen a roach. Nobody did anything. Gross. Never coming back."}
{"text":"I have not been any place like this  before ...Famous Dave.. It's horrible .. Horrible ...I order food to go ..how cheap it could be ..I  order potato wedges even its a small portion ..the potato wedges  they gave  me is worst then a kids meal ..they give u with this  big box but there are only a few little  piece  of  potato wedges in the box ..You better off go to KFC u would get more  potato wedges then that for a fast food place ..and I order  Cesar salad ..again  it's so small  portion for almost  nine dollar  ..and the worst parts is when I came home there's no Cesar dressing  at all ..I end up  eating my salad with no dressing ..I would not recommend to order any food to go from there .. It' ridiculous how much they give u for the price u pay for.. Never again I would go there . Worst place ever!!!!"}
{"text":"Where to start??
The hostess was polite she sat us down.
Mind you, this restaurant wasn't even busy. It was a family before us. 
Back to the story. 
Our server was Marina, seemed scared to even talk to us. We ordered from the Happy Hour; Nachos and Rib Tips. My sister and I can't eat onion. We asked her does anything have onions, she said no. 
A couple comes in and they are sat down as well two tables down from us. The first family, my sister and I are just seating down looking at one another confused  what's taking so long. Well, our server and another server are just at that third table that got sat down. 20-30 min pass by we can't even get attention. Thank god for the hostess, she tells her, hey I think your food is ready... Our server yeah yeah yeah I'll get it soon. Hostess brings out the food and goes to the server, doesn't even move or grab the plates just pointes at the our table. Hostess gives us our food, sees I need a refill, server then comes ask is everything ok. Doesn't even let us answer sees I need a refill just leaves. So now the hostess and server bring me two cups. Its ok I'll drink it I don't care at this point. So rib tips are good up until my sister finds a hair. We get to the nachos looks like throw up. We go through it find onions. Im like wtf at this point. Servers are at this third table talking talking and talking. I want to leave at this point. So our server walks by I raise my hand and tell her can we have our bill please. This is were she acts nice oh please take your time.. I'm just like really? Anyways I know bad service when I see it! Actually you can feel it. It was wack, just because we ordered Happy Hour and water doesn't give you the right to treat us like nothing. What happened to customer service? Doesn't that matter nowadays? Overall i wouldn't even give this place a star, but thanks to the hostess!"}
{"text":"Ribs and the Burnt Ends are great.  Don't get the corn on the cob, they are soggy like they have been soaking in water all day.  Corn bread is good.  With ribs & burnt ends the pickles you get with it are a little spicy."}
{"text":"Love this place! Here almost every Monday.  My kids love the food. Love the ultimate burgee and ribs are great."}
{"text":"We had dinner on Tuesday Feb. 21st and the food was great. I would like to tell you about our server, Jasmyn P. She is what a server should be like. She was always there for drink refills and kept us informed as to the status of our dinner. Also, the manager came by to check on us to see if everything was ok."}
{"text":"I went months ago, and I'll never return! A young black man had our table and I've never had service this terrible. We ordered waters when we sat down he took our order and when our food came out I asked where our water were. He came back few min later with it I asked for two beers, and started eating. By the time our food was almost gone he checked on us and I asked where the beers were, his reply was we're all out of beer without caring he'd left us waiting for 30min. At 8pm on a Tuesday and you couldn't have told me this when I ordered it, obviously they're not out he was just lazy. There was only 3 tables and two servers, if you don't want to serve tables get a different job. I'm an over tipper because I was a server and now a cocktail server but this was my first time I put a 0 in the tip line! Management must be as lazy as their employees because when I worked at a restaurant we knew we were expected to be attentive and efficient, not to mention aware of the customers and knowledgeable of menu items. We were ready to walk out after ordering but we wanted to try the food, we should have done just that, walk out! Also no one was greeted that came in I watched 4 parties leave, they need a host or at least servers on the floor not talking behind the wall, ps customers can see you slacking off. I hope this place closes soon so a better restaurant can take its place that I can go to by the house. I will be contacting the main office!"}
{"text":"Food was really good. Ribs were great the brisket wasn't bad and the chicken was juicy and flavorful. However, from the moment we walked in the door the service was just absent. There were numerous people waiting in the foyer with no hostess to be found for at least five minutes, this should have been our first red flag. The restaurant was dead but we had to wait for a table to be wiped down. Second red flag. Ordered a beer with dinner and it took until food was served to get it. Never a single water refill and waiting for a check took at least ten minutes. Had to send the family to the car while I waited to cash out. Could've been a great evening but the service overshadowed the food....in a bad way."}
{"text":"Famous Jaimie was amazing.  My two daughters loved her and she made the night out great for the family.  The food as always was perfect especially the brisket.  Thanks Jaimie."}
{"text":"Just had the BBQ mixed platter. 
Very tasty and filling as well!!! The sauce spitting fire is perfect.
Side dish fries and corn bread. Im stuffed !!! well priced location is close to everything in Henderson. desert's are off the hook!!! if you can manage to finish it. Over all good!!"}
{"text":"So we went to eat and we always go to this location and they are always super busy and we always have to wait because of this you know but we never mind because the service and food are always worth it. Today we went I noticed there was new people we get there was no one there it was pretty much empty we get there and we were a total of 8 people a big party I know they told us five minutes so we can get the table ready that was fine we waited fifteen minutes later people started coming in and we were still waiting and they were sitting parties as big as ours and we were still waiting 45 minutes later after complaining and complaining they take us to our table we order and it took for ever and once the food gets it's way to salty the waitress went 3 times to our table to take our order leave the drinks and give us the check we complained but it was never addressed and then I see cockroaches coming out from the kitchen after that I felt sick to my stomach because we had just finished eating and yes I took pictures it so gross and all the new personal that they have are slow and rude we will not be coming back"}
{"text":"The food was alright but the costumer service was terrible the girls would be sitting at the table with the guy costumers flirting and wouldn't check up to see how we were doing they only checked up on us once and we had to get up to ask for the check because they never came to us terrible experience the costumer service was horrible would not recommend."}
{"text":"Nice BBq joint, everything tasted real good, or maybe I just love BBQ!
Special mention to the pecan pie, terrific!"}
{"text":"First off, customer service from beginning to end was excellent.  The food on the other hand was good but not great. It's obviously a chain, so I understand recipes and portions need to be consistent. Today the food was lacking in true BBQ authenticity.  The meat was dried up, and the BBQ chicken tender sauce had an odd tinge to it. We were surprised the waitress didn't notice one meal had not been touched, but we chose not to make a fuss since she was attentive and on point.  Not many choices on that side if town, but worth the trip overall."}
{"text":"This location rocks.  Always helpful service, and the food is consistently perfect.   They smoke that meat until it is falling off the bones.   

Never hugely busy for eat-in service, but the take-out side does really well.  Typically you don't have to wait more than a few minutes even you if walk in and order.  Phone service can be a bit slow on Friday nights though."}
{"text":"Great place, good food. Our goto quick lunch place.  Do the Key Lime our while you are here.  Great burgers here as well."}
{"text":"I ordered to go. I went to the To Go section in the back and was met with a lot of friendliness coming in. I ordered the Louisiana Style Ribs. It is very good. They also have the BBQ sauce packets that you can take with you. I found that very convenient because the ribs are so big they tend to last me for two days. I use the packets when I reheat the ribs and it taste just as savory even the next day.   If you are a cornbread lover, I recommend ordering a couple more extra. It is buttery, soft, and just so delicious!"}
{"text":"i love it! will come back soon !!!"}
{"text":"Service was good. Kitchen was slow. Moderately expensive, compares to Joes crab shack pricing. Overall good not great."}
{"text":"Management Needed: Waited 45 minutes to get a pick up order with no apology or explanation from the manager. If you have an opportunity to eat out, do not go to this establishment due to its poor service and poor attitude"}
{"text":"Really I come here for the bread pudding....its my favorite...of anywhere!   I ordered the salmon with grilled pineapple and steamed broccoli....I didnt leave a morsel.  The salmon had a pineapple glaze which was out of this world tasty!  Ill be back for both the salmon and bread pudding! Service was good too."}
{"text":"Best of the best place for a delicious happy hour or bring the family in for a great dinner! 's! Yummy locals favorite BBC place!"}
{"text":"Great REGULAR mac and cheese. I don't really care for the Dave's Mac and cheese. I love their tips. Not so much of the catfish fingers and cod fan. But overall it's close to my home and next to the mall!!!"}
{"text":"I used to like Famous Dave's, went in today a Monday. It was dead, took 15 minutes to be seated and then to a dirty booth. Won't be going back to this place again. Went to Lucille's instead, fantastic service and food."}
{"text":"I lived in TX most of my life and I have attended and even judged BBQ cookoffs, so I know BBQ. This place was a one-off to which I will never return. I ordered the \"Texas Beef Brisket\" dinner, hubby ordered the \"Georgia Chopped Pork\". He was quite happy with his pork, which he said was very tender. I tasted a tiny bite and it was greasy, bland and fatty. But yes, tender....because of all the fat. He had potato salad as one of his sides and it was LOADED with onion. My brisket was the worst I have had in my life, and several hours later, I am still feeling sick. It was tough, rubbery and SO salty. Based on the texture, appearance and taste, it appeared to be cooked several days ago (or weeks? I don't know), frozen, then thawed and sliced as needed, as the rubbery texture testified to improper cooking and re-heating (possibly multiple times and possibly by microwave). I was so desperately hungry I slathered on the sauce, of which there were 5 to choose from (2 of which I liked but that is why they give you options), and ate it anyway. I ordered the mac & cheese and green beans as my sides. The mac & cheese was edible, despite the use of powdered cheese (yes I know, but I had to try it) but had a bit of jalapeno which gave it some interest. The green beans were soggy, wrinkled and overcooked, again, probably previously frozen and thawed as needed. They would do better to just serve the canned variety. I had to laugh at the perfectly proportioned bowls the sides were served in, it appeared they were also prepared ahead of time and heated as needed. The corn muffin was the best part of the meal but had so much sugar in it, it was more like a cupcake than a \"corn muffin\" to be served with a savory meal. This is no dig on the service, the girls were all friendly, but the food was just terrible. This is my .02 and I am entitled to it. But I won't ever go back."}
{"text":"I'm new to the Henderson area and stopped in for lunch. I was very excited to find such a great BBQ place. I ate the beef brisket and ribs, with a corn muffin and sweet tea. The meal was fantastic! Everything was delicious and the staff were very friendly. I'd definitely recommend it if you haven't tried it."}
{"text":"Have been there multiple times we always recieve excellent service. Great food and good prices!"}
{"text":"I have been very impressed with this location. The ribs and chicken are amazing and the corn on the cob is always fresh and deliciously sweet. We used to go to the Lake Mead and Rainbow location. However the staff, restaurant cleanliness, and overall food quality have made this location the one we frequent. Julie and Noemi are both great. They greet customers with a smile and ensure that the orders are right the first time. I have witnessed Julie handle the 4th of July crowd with patience and excellent customer service ( even when several customers were rude to her and others in the line.) She never lost her smile. Noemi even acknowledges regular customers by name and remembers their orders. Again, I highly recommend this location. It's nice to know that friendly customer service and quality are the norm not exception here."}
{"text":"So, some people think a BBQ chain could'nt actually have good BBQ. 
I'd have to disagree, their BBQ is pretty darn good. 

The portions are very generous. On monday's, they've been having children's menu selection for $0.99 which is perfect for the little one's. Plus, you dont have to feel bad if they dont finish it. 
My husband and I split the \"que for two\": chicken, 4 bones,brisket and 2 sides. The brisket is YUM! Chicken and Ribs are just as good! We could not finish the meal, tastes just as good the next day too! =D

I do have to say that this last visit the service was lacking.. I'm not completely sure if the server we happen to have was new, but she took quite some time to take our order and refill our drinks. She actually had 2 tables leave right after ordering their drinks because of the long wait.
Otherwise she was nice and she compensated by giving my children free cornbreads to take home, nice!"}
{"text":"My second fav. bbq in vegas the  first is buzz's.  FD is very consistent ,been there at least 20 x and food always good. The ribs and brisket very tender . Most bbq joints treat there sides like afterthoughts not FD , All the sides ive had in the past were always good. cornbread , beans, green beans,potato salad  and cole slaw."}
{"text":"What a great place for families! We got the combo platters and shared...very economical and everyone was pleased. The Mac and cheese was a hit with the kids and the ribs and brisket were outstanding."}
{"text":"Slab tuesday! Yummy! St.louis ribs! Bacon mac&cheese! Baked beans! BIG DADDY APPROVES!"}
{"text":"Ordered to go. Got a slab of St Louis Ribs and a whole country roasted chicken. Total cost $40. The chicken was good maybe a little small. The ribs here are no longer fall off the bone. They are tough, and underdone.  We like them tender, fall off the bone. So for ribs, we will be going elsewhere. 
Sorry Famous Dave's you will no longer be getting our business when we are in the mood for ribs."}
{"text":"A really good place to eat for your typical BBQ food. They've got a pretty good family pack, kid's menu, and burgers. They do take a while to sit people though."}
{"text":"Sometimes you need BBQ that sets your tongue ablaze with smokey deliciousness, and sometimes you want something that's more affordable but satisfying.  Famous Dave's offers both.
  In a traditional wooden motif, Famous Dave's has a good affordable lunch menu, and a great array of different barbecued items to eat.  I also am a stickler for good sauce, and Famous Dave's has everything from sweet, to spicy, to even their own BBQ-style mustard that's wonderfully tangy and unique.
  Whether it was the baby back ribs, the brisket, or the pulled pork, it all was spectacular, and came out quickly and efficiently.  Even the sides were great, with a mac and cheese that had the subtle crunch of peppers in it, or the cornbread that was hot, flaky, and not too sweet.
  Reasonable lunch menus were nicely priced, although not as generous as the dinner platters, food-wise."}
{"text":"So happy hour  wings and fries basket $4.99. 

Let the portion tell u if this is worthy for $4.99. I should have rather go to wingstop pay regular price because the wings would be twice size as these. And fries?? 9 pieces?? Really famous daves!??? Your reputation is going down the gutter... You just lost 3 customers. Your a disappointment. And when asked your server. Portion matters if it happy hour. He said happy hour always small portion. Ive eaten here before and this portion is not small its NOT worthy of $4.99! Thats just as saying if you go to a bar for happy hour for a beer they will give you half a bottle because its happy hour???? Rip off!"}
{"text":"Everytime we come here, we always order the family feast. The serving is overwhelming. I love the ribs and brisket. (the sides too!) Can't get enough of it. The ambiance is nice too. I just wish the servers a little more attentive to the tables they're serving cox the last time we were there, it took a while before the waiter refilled our drinks."}
{"text":"HUGE portions - the cost is super reasonable for quality and size. Only complaint was almost $2.50 for soft drinks. I know it's a common markup for restaurants but it annoys me.

Kids meals are great value and the lunch specials had some great combinations.

Service was good natured and friendly - no fawning or trying too hard - a definite thumbs up."}
{"text":"Been here about 5 times now. Never a bad experience. Brisket, Ribs Chicken...it's all bomb!

The portions are great and I still wish they were bigger so I don't feel fat ordering 2! lol

Everything is tender and juicy, never dry like a lot of BBQ Joints. They have the formula down pat. I haven't even tried any of the many sauces they make, I'm not that into dousing BBQ with sauce. If it's made right, it doesn't need any and they always make it right. But if sauce is your thing, I'm sure they have one for you. There's like 6 types on the table."}
{"text":"So, let me say that BBQ is not my favorite meal, but Dave's is better than most. Full entree's are huge. Better to stick with the lunch specials. Love the chopped pork sand and always order it with coleslaw on top (which they call Mississippi style, but it is served all over the south that way). I order it naked (without BBQ sauce) because the sauces are way to smokey and spicy-hot for my taste and (like most everywhere else) they gob it on and spoil the sandwich. Order a single plate of anything else to share unless you are super hungry or want to take a meal home in a box too! Service always seems pleasant and reasonably quick given how busy the restaurant usually is."}
{"text":"Just happened to visit this location after a round of golf..Had the rib and chicken combo w/beans and coleslaw.. EVERYTHING was great.. The ribs didn't need the extra sauces, it had enough flavor by itself.. I'm glad our GPS suggested this place..I will definitely eat here again on my next visit to Las Vegas.."}
{"text":"Love their food...great ribs and yum burnt ends! Staff is always very nice as well. Tonight bartender is a doll 

Lately though it seems like they are trying to cut so many corners to save money I hope they are doing ok. The last cut are these wine glasses that are about the size of a thimble. No likey!!"}
{"text":"NOTHING FAMOUS ABOUT THIS PLACE. Horrible portions especially for a barbecue place. I got a two meat combo with an extra meat side of catfish an paid extra and two sides with it. I dont eat alot and ate it ALL. And didnt enjoy while i did, brisket isn't moist AT ALL. Its like the microwavable kind I Swear on my life. The mac an cheese is not baked or anything its like the kind you get in a frozen box lunch meal. DO NOT GET THE CATFISH, when they say strips they mean it! I paid extra for 3 french fry sized strips of catfish. Who knows if it was even catfish. NOONE was in this place when we went and now we know why. Dont think this place will last long, the corn muffin was great though, but a million muffins cant help this place."}
{"text":"After a long day at work I was starving for some bomb food. My date suggested we go to famous daves to try it out. I had to wait a minute or 2 for the hostess to seat us. We had requested Amy (she is an awesome server btw), but she was already cut so Ms.Kristen I believe took care of us. She was a super great too. Even though we got there a little bit before closing, she let us take our time with no rush. I am very particular about how my servers take care of me, because of the simple fact that I am young. However Ms. Kristen did a phenomenal job. I was a little hesitant of eating here because I'm not a huge fan of bbq, but man do I take it back. I had the cedar salmon. It was scrumptious.  My date had the feast for 1. He said it was awesome. Both us finished our meals. We even eat dessert. I forgot what it's called. I think something Blondie. Very good. Thanks!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch spots with my friends. The food is always good and the service is always friendly. Dave's Mac and cheese and the spicy pickles are my favorite."}
{"text":"My partner and I visited Famous Dave's a couple weeks ago, so I apologize for the late review. We are huge fans of BBQ in general, and enjoy eating here when we come. It was a Thursday night. We arrived around 8:30 PM and found an empty lobby with no host to sit us down for at least 3 full minutes. Finally, the host came and sat us down. It took another 7 minutes to see our waitress who came over and took our drink order, as well as our food order since we had so much time. We saw our waitress a total of 3 times the entire night - taking our order, delivering food and delivering our check just 5 minutes after we got our food, even though she insisted she wasn't rushing us. Her failure to stay attentive to us and other tables caused her tip to suffer. It wasn't terribly busy but a decent size crowd for a Thursday. We will come back again soon, but we will be critiquing customer service extra hard on our next visit. Oh, by the way, the ribs were great as always! We shared a full rack of baby back ribs. The Mac and Cheese was kind of bland though."}
{"text":"If you want good bbq and the best service you have ever experienced see René at Famous Daves Henderson that pretty lady with an amazing personality knows her stuff"}
{"text":"Oh the day after my Bday. I woke up not when I wanted and had a mild headache going, but the parents were in town so I hopped out of bed and was on time. 

My mom loves coming here so this was an easy choice for me as well. The past few times we came here I notice we been ordering the same choice, All American BBQ Feast with some added ribs and Brisket. Every time we visit here the food is consistent as well as the service. This time around the highlights for me were the corn muffins, BBQ chicken, ribs, and Lemonade. The slaw had a little more liquid that normal but nothing major. 

When we came it was not that busy so we had excellent service and the manager even dropped in to check if everything was going good. All in all, it was a good Sunday meal."}
{"text":"(From a few weeks ago) First of all, the food was great as usual. No complaints in that department. Stacie was our server... whole other story. I have never heard a server refer to her customers as \"Young Lady, Young Man, Babe, or Sweetie\" so many times in my life. Every single time she approached any of her tables EACH of these \"terms of endearments\" came out of her mouth. I lost count after about the 30-40 times we heard or experienced them. So unprofessional and annoying. And then when we refused her offer of dessert she \"jokingly\" called us lightweights. C'mon now, really? We couldn't have gotten out of there fast enough. In fact, my son and I left my very irritated husband sitting at the table to handle the check while we ran for the car. Guess we'll stick with the Blue Diamond location that we usually go to because there's NO way we could ever sit and listen to that again. Also, I wouldn't want to be humiliated by her in the event we opted for using the \"Sissy Sauce\" as she called one of the choices. Wow, I don't think I've ever left a restaurant feeling so bullied before...

On the other hand, Don (I believe he was the manager on duty) was very helpful and attentive.  :)"}
{"text":"This place has been my favorite BBQ place in town for years...until now!!  We placed a takeout order on Tues night. The food was old...super dry ribs AND beef brisket AND cornbread. I just called the manager to tell them how awful the experience was.  She did not care at all !! She hung up on me!! She explained that the food had to be returned within 24 hours for anything to be done about it. Unfortunately,  I have been suffering from an adverse reaction to medication that I was unable to even get out of bed yesterday. Obviously, calling Famous Dave's was not a priority. I told her that I would spread the word about this horrible experience and I would not be returning as a customer.  She did not care in the least. As th GM, she couldn't do anything.  Maybe if I call the manager on duty that night, that Mgr could do something if I bring in the receipt and the food. I call BS!! If she is the GM, she has the power to make it right. Shame on you Famous Dave's! ! This person should not be managing a customer service business! !"}
{"text":"Went tonight - hadn't been in a few yrs, & what a disappointment.

I ordered four bones that came w\two sides. I had chips & dirty rice. Upon the 1st bite of the bones, they were chewy; they tasted good, but chewy? Who knows how long they were sitting there {as Nancy M stated whose took five mins}. I don't think we waited \"that long...\" They did bring a replacement & were nice about it; those were tender, so why not bring THOSE out to begin with?? You could tell the difference straightaway just by looking @ them; if I could tell, they could  tell.

Their version of dirty rice is NOT the case. IDK what I'd call it {besides dry & not dirty} - maybe UNdirty rice. For me to leave over \ not eat the rice, ya KNOW {well now ya know} it's gotta be BAD. The chips were to have a rub on them. I couldn't taste it, so for plain homemade chips, that's what they were.

Corn muffins were real good; literally fell apart & had a good taste.

IDK what happened to this place..."}
{"text":"Eh, just average. Food was ok. Server was good. Wasn't too busy n got seated right away on a Saturday night. The food came out quick, got our plates before the appetizer, weird. Ordered Burnt Ends on the appetizer, some of it was tough n some of it was tender. Chicken was ok, a lil dry. Burger n ribs were good and the drinks stayed full. Everything was ok but I remember it being better before this trip."}
{"text":"Late night (9pm, not really late night in Vegas....) dinner with Dad.
Luckily he had a coupon or we would have called it and left after not even receiving water for 12 minutes, our Bud Light and a Spiked Lemonade took 17 minutes.
We opted for the BBQ for 2, for which we had a coupon. That was the best part....
Awkward extremely bright lights at the tables, the Manager walked by several times smiling ( we have no idea what for-- this was not a happy place to be) but never stopped to check in, neither did our server -- ever-- or any of the other 4 servers who were too busy detailing their closed sections to high-tail it out as soon as they could. Our server did have time to stand and chat it up with her friends at the table across the way-- proving she has a personality but not willing to share it with us. Too bad, having been in the service industry and FOH manager for years, I'm an excellent tipper for good service. 
Such a bummer, really wanted to enjoy our time together but this was definitely NOT the place for that!
Astoundingly awful service. Poor Management to overlook a table trying to get your attention and make it right before we left.
Two thumbs wayyyy down!"}
{"text":"Deeeelicious food! The ribs and brisket are amazing. Its one of our favorite spots now."}
{"text":"This place was not good at all. We changed something on our order and when the food came it was the original order. So we told our waitress and she looked at us like she was so confused and didn't know what we were talking about. She got a little rude to us probably due to misunderstanding but as someone in the service industry I would expect professionalism. She went back to the kitchen and we heard her yelling at someone. Again a lack of professionalism. Our food came back out fast but almost too fast. As if they just gave us some plate that had been sitting out. The food was dry and bland. I drenched my food in BBQ sauce for the flavor. When we ordered our beer the one I wanted was out. The best part of our meal was the corn bread. It was butter and flaky and delicious. The variety of BBQ sauce was also really nice. We had a lot of fun trying each sauce. It adds for fun table conversation. the happy hour is a great deal even though they ran out of the beer I wanted."}
{"text":"Went to dinner last night at 6.  Got sat by hostess - restaurant not busy at all.  She said that server would be right with us, so we waited and waited and waited.  No server.  Hostess stopping by again and said that server would be right with us.  Again waited and waited and waited.  Again no server.  Got up to leave - as we're leaving the same hostess tells us to have a good night.  Wow!  Last two times we've been here service has been terrible.  Came tonight to give them one more chance.  NEVER AGAIN!  Went to Billie's barbecue - had a great experience."}
{"text":"I was in the flamingo /215 area when gf proclaimed it's dinner time - first thought was a burger but found out kilroys kitchen is not open ( also noticed while driving to kilroy's that joe's crap shack closed - that surprised me. ) We were then thinking bbq - i prefer Buzz but the gf wanted to give Famous Dave's \" one last chance .\" 

I've now been to this location two times, and the Blue Diamond spot three times. 

For a \"chain\" the place ain't bad. As with most bbq places, they have consistency problems - especially the brisket and pulled pork - of the 2, i favor the brisket. The chicken is ok but truthfully, i try to avoid bbq chicken when i hit a bbq place. 

I like the sauce variety, love the corn muffins and the mac and cheese works for me. the ribs were meh , the bread pudding - love the sauce the bread is way to light for my taste - more french toast like then bread pudding. 

I'll stick with Buzz but in a pinch, sure, I'll hit Famous Dave's ( even if their commercial's annoy me ! )"}
{"text":"LOVE this place and with the new lunch prices will go more often.
They have a birthday club where you can buy 1 get 1 free meal up to 15.00 which is a really good deal.
Had the brisket and ribs combo for lunch you WILL be filled up..EVERYTHING tasted fantatsic.."}
{"text":"i really enjoyed this place. the ambiance is very comfortable. i loved the decor. very clean. the waitstaff is very friendly. the food is delicious. we had the ribs and the frito pie and both were phenomenal. will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"So I decided to treat myself to some Famous Daves BBQ today for lunch.  Ordered. The bee tips with fries, beef brisket slider & a pork slider.
The beef tips are delicious & well worth the price.  The beef brisket slider was tasty but lacked much meat actually on the bread.
The pork slider was just horrible & full of just fat instead of any meat.  Horrible, horrible, horrible.  No one at the restaurant cared about my experience or taste of the food.  
Side note, my Arnold planet was refreshing & my waitress was very nice."}
{"text":"Coming from a person who does not like BBQ, this means a lot, LOL! I'm not a saucy BBQ person & I'm not big on meats being slightly sweet, but I have to say that Famous Dave's definitely changed my outlook on BBQ. 

My husband & I (hesitantly) decided to come here for dinner. It's the location by 215/Flamingo next to the LVAC. There's lots of open seating & the service was very prompt. Shout out to our server, Mike?, he was so awesome & really took care of us.

We ordered the appetizer sampler that came with fried catfish, chicken tenders, boneless (or you can get bone-in) wings, rib tips, onion rings & 4 sauces (BBQ, blue cheese, remoulade, & a sweet chili). It was delicious... I think we made ourselves full from that alone.

There was a $3 off deal for the brisket plate, so I got that & hubby got the chopped pork plate. All plates come with a corn muffin & two sides, so we both got the famous fries & Mac n cheese with an extra side of potato salad. Let me tell you when the plates came out, it's a LOT of food! ... well as I mentioned earlier we were probably full from the appetizer, but it's still a good amount of food! Both meats sit on a slice of white bread & OMG the cornbread muffin was warm, steaming & deliciously sweet. The mac n cheese was packed w/ flavor, but I'm not a fan of the corn in it. Potato salad was just your average, not over the top amazing. And the fries were thick cut wedges.

On to the meats... they were MOIST, which is usually a big issue for pork. But they were super moist & don't need any BBQ sauce unless you're that person that likes it slathered. Very delicious!

Would definitely recommend coming here!

Review for 12/23 - Came here for lunchtime but brought the family along as well since we had such a good experience at DINNER. Sorry to say our lunchtime experience was upsetting. We ordered the Family Platter that feeds 4-6 people. The chicken was still bleeding & pink inside so we asked for the manager. The manager said, \"That's bone marrow..\" ... bone marrow is in the bone & isn't pink or bleeding. Anyway, our server kindly replaced it for some sausage links. To our dismay, they were burnt on one side. Again, we asked our server to replace it & he did while throwing in a few more corn muffins. 

Sorry, but the lunch experience wasn't the best & could use some work. Will be coming here for dinner from now on."}
{"text":"I love that I can enjoy delicious BBQ while still counting calories! I had BBQ chicken breast that was so juicy, firecracker green beans, mashed red potatoes, and half of a cornbread muffin for under 450 calories! And it was SO good!!"}
{"text":"I Had the \"Big Slab\" take out, IT SUCKED!!! This place has gone downhill fast! Ribs looked like dried jerky on a bone.. I'm not going back!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow. Just wow. I told myself I would never go to a food chain restaurant after TGIFriday nightmare, BUT this place is amazing! Waaaayyyy better than any chain ribs/BBQ I've eaten at on the west coast. Fall off the bone ribs and hearty sauces. Best part is there is an array of deliciousness (sauce) on the table to choose from! Wilber beans are tasty. My favorite sauce has got to be the Texas pit mixed with devils spit! So delicious with a surprising kick at the end (heat). The staff here are friendly and attentive.  

Lunch specials are perfect for your stomach and your pocket! Overall a good atmosphere for laid back BBQ feel. Famous Dave's makes thee best host to a BBQ dinner with family and friends! They also have BBQ catering perfect for the summer! Come down and check it out! You will NOT be disappointed! Get your grub on!"}
{"text":"Their picture looks nice doesn't it? Don't be fooled. Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere. Went to this location for father's day last night. We were a party of 11...2 father's 2 wives 5 children a Grampa and a grandma (me) Got seated and server took our order. I ordered a burger and fries. The others ordered rib feast, brisket, tacos, mac n cheese, fries, slaw, corn muffins 4 kids plates, etc etc etc...A while later server comes and tells us there was no more brisket and you can have pork in it's place. Really? Have you priced brisket compared to pork? Didn't want that but accepted it. The food finally comes after about a 30 min wait. Three little strips of fatty brisket sitting on the plates. Server said \"We found some brisket.\" WHAT?! You FOUND some brisket? Where? In the garbage after it was cut off from the good part that was served to another customer? Server proceeds to give everyone their food. Except me. The burger and fries person. After everyone starts eating the server comes back and tells me that there is no burger cooked. It apparently got overlooked. But no worries...we will get it right up and your burger will be taken off the bill. Fine. I'm a patient person. Furthermore I don't complain in a restaurant. Spit turns my stomach. By the time my burger came out everyone was almost finished eating. Server puts my burger in front of me with mac and cheese next to it and no fries. She tells me they are out of fries but some are coming up. I sit there so disgusted I can't eat. Then she comes with the fries. Thinking they are hot and fresh and just made (which was why I had to wait right?) I had one. Cold and old like they were taken off of someone's plate! That did it I was done. The server the whole time was apologizing and we kept telling her it wasn't her fault. She felt so bad she said this is not right and I'm going to get the manager for you. We did not ask to see the manager. The manager comes to our table and instead of understanding we have been wronged and being apologetic he just stands there looking at us like yeah?..what's the problem? By that point we were just over it and wanted to leave. My burger was taken off the bill and we were given 20% off the bill but what we all really wanted on father's day was a nice meal at Famous Daves which is now Infamous Dave's to all of us! I sat through the whole meal with my family drinking iced tea and having one nasty fry that made me want to puke! This place SUCKS! DO NOT GO!!!!"}
{"text":"The food here was decent. I liked the brisket that I got. What really killed it for me was my server. She was rude to me but was perfectly nice to my husband. When I ordered  my son a fruit punch and a sundae, she seemed to get overly annoyed with me and said, 'If he has the fruit punch and sundae, he is going to be up all night.'. I told her I really didn't care, especially because it wasn't her place to really say anything, but I ignored it. It turns out, she got the dessert for the other two kids but didn't get him his sundae, forcing her opinion on us. He had to sit there without his dessert while the other kids ate theirs. I am so pissed at that server. I wish I could get her fired for her treatment of me and my son."}
{"text":"I was not sure what to expect. We had friends in town who wanted barbecue. I am not a big barbecue fan, so I turned to Yelp. I choose this place as the reviews were decent and i live on this side of town Also I had seen the commercial. 

Well I have to say from the minute we arrived I knew I made a good choice. The hostess was very nice. Even though our friends had not yet arrived we were seated right away. 

We ordered drinks, they kept checking back to see if we wanted appetizers or refills. 

The food was good. I am allergic to pork so I had to watch what I ordered. 

My BF and myself ordered the feast for two. It really is enough for 3 or 4. They put the ribs on a separate platter for us. BF said ribs were very good. I thought the chicken was good, loved the coleslaw and fries. The brisket was fork tender. Our friends had ribs and really enjoyed them. 

Would go back again."}
{"text":"Great BBQ. The servings are generous, unlimited BBQ sauce perfect for eating or taking out.

Highly recommend this place if you're in need or serving a party or just want something to eat during the upcoming football season"}
{"text":"I'm usually very pleased with the staff, food, and overalls experience. However one of the only reasons I eat there is because of their sauce Wilbur's revenge. This last time I went they were out so I was slightly disappointed but the food was still good just not as hot as I'd like it. Very friendly staff and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"It was all I had hoped for and more! It had been awhile since I'd been to a famous daves, but when my boyfriend and I went today everything was perfect. Rakia was attentive & the brisket/ Mac n cheese/ cornbread were our favorite parts. The little potato wedges are good too! If you're trying to feast, great place to go :)"}
{"text":"Great service,great ribs couldn't ask for a better dinner!"}
{"text":"Burnt ends are a must! Been here about 5-6x, never the same experience twice. Some days excellent, some days above average. But never a bad experience."}
{"text":"With all that I heard I finally decided to go and try this famous place for barbecue last month and it's awesome! I've now been back three times and the food has great taste and customer service is excellent. Didn't have to wait long to be seated as soon as we walked in we were greeted. Didn't wait long for our food and they have great portions there's family feasts to share and be able to try a little of everything. Sound level was perfect good for family's or just to hang out and have a good meal. Definitely will recommend and be back for more ."}
{"text":"Maybe I didn't order what makes this Dave guy so famous because I was hardly blown away. Ribs were great but not earth shattering. The brisket was just ok and barely that, as were the potato wedges, however the mash and baked beans were pretty good. The sauces were all fairly good except for the sweet one which I thought was excellent. The service was great and the atmosphere just makes you feel like having BBQ. I will try other BBQ spots but I also see a return visit in my future. Definitely a good experience."}
{"text":"Got the combo special and it was perfect. Everything was made fresh and the beef brisket was delicious. All the meat was tender and the sides were really good."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Waitress had a smoke while we waited for drink refills. Nice! Manager (female) clueless.  Me and my family wont return. I ate here about a month ago and the service was lacking as well. You will be out of business soon."}
{"text":"This last time, we arrived about 7:30 pm on Friday.  There were 3-4 tables of people waiting to be seated ahead of us.  We were told our wait would be 20-30 minutes - a party of 4.  I walked through the restaurant to restrooms and found 40-50% of the tables empty but set and ready, and the bar completely empty.  We were seated about 30 minutes later.  Our drinks order was taken, and a few minutes later our meal orders were placed. It took about 15 minutes to receive our drinks.  Our meals weren't received until 8:45-8:50 pm, and that was only 3 of our 4 plates.  The food was closer to cold then hot and the 3 of us were done before the 4th plate was served ~ at least that one was hot.  All of our dishes were dry and over cooked.  This was the 3rd time we've been to his location, and all have been similar experiences.  Other locations have been okay, overpriced but decent.  I think we are done with Dave's."}
{"text":"We've been to this location a few times now and are consistently dissapointed, from popular menu items not available to being given the wrong items. Famous Dave's has always been a delicious go to for our family but this location does not live up to the usual greatness We've come to expect. Last night's dinner was the final disappointment. Our server was nice enough and the food came out quick. However, the quality of the food was sub par. I ordered the Dave's Sassy Barbeque Salad with Beef Brisket, which I love most of the time. Last night the meat, if it could even be called that, was 90% chopped fat rib meat. It was visually unappealing and inedible.
I would like to say we'll continue to give it a chance but we won't be back."}
{"text":"The food was good I LOVED our server Ashley she was polite, attentive and made the whole experience great"}
{"text":"I have been to this location numerous times. I usually ask for Drew or Debra - They are the best! They are very friendly and attentive to my needs.

I love their St. Louis-Style Spareribs with the Wilbur beans and garlic red-skin mashed potatoes! They have several choices of sauces. But, I enjoy the Texas Pit sauce. If you don't specify your rib sauce in advance of the order, your ribs will come coated in the Rich & Sassy sauce. You can alway apply your own sauces after, but it may have a mixture of flavors.

I enjoy their sweet tea too!"}
{"text":"There are not many BBQ places by my house and I am yet to find one of the BBQ stands we use to have back home in the midwest. They greet when when you walk in the door which i love, Its iffy if you give you the homemade chips to eat with BBQ sauce when you are waiting on your food. The service could use a tad bit of improvment, consistancy in if you get the chips, checking back to see if you need something, there have been many times we never got refills on our drinks or had to wait a long time to get check and togo boxes. The food is tasty sometimes the ribs can be tough but they have no prob taking them back and replacing them. I would not recomend the ribtips they tend to be over cooked. My husbands favorite is the sweetwater catfish he has never had a complaint about them. I love the mac n cheese with corn and jalapeno's in them so tasty it's my favorie side they offer. We used them for potluck at work and I was impressed that the food stayed warm and it was tasty like if we ate it at the resturant."}
{"text":"One of the better BBQ joints in Las Vegas for my taste. I've been stuck going to rolling smoke but always disappointed at how much fat is in the brisket 

I tried a variety of things on the menu.  I asked for lean brisket and that's what I got. Nice smoke ring. Delicious flavor. Great when it was fresh and amazing as a left over later. 

Pulled chicken was boring. Skip it. The bbq chicken was just that. BBQ chicken. It wasn't smoked. Again not worth the trip.  

The burnt ends. Omg I ended up getting two orders. They are so good. Swimming in a caramelized sauce.  I couldn't get enough.  It's probably the only thing I'd order next time. 

The sides: mash potato and Mac and cheese were about average.  The corn was fresh and crisp. The onion straws were salty and addictive.  The corn bread biscuit was heavenly.  

I gotta stop eating like this or my pants won't fit."}
{"text":"We've been in here a few times and their service and barbecue is really good... but, that's about it for me. Their sides just don't do it for me and when it comes to barbecue, sides matter. 

I have ordered the mac & cheese, baked beans, french fries and side salad during my two visits. The side salad is about the only side that I have enjoyed. Perhaps it's just my personal preference, but I didn't enjoy the jalapeños in the macaroni, I didn't enjoy how runny the baked beans were and the french fries could have used a little seasoning. 

The barbecue chicken sandwich I ordered, however, was awesome! They have various barbecue sauces at the table that you can add as well. My lunch date had the ribs and I got to try those too... also really good. Oh! I almost forgot, the cornbread is pretty good too. 

I'm not sure what I was expecting... when I think barbecue I think of a fusion of southern and soul food. I had never tried macaroni with jalapeños, and was open to it... but once I actually had them I realized why no one that I know had made them. 

So! In conclusion... rhe service is great and the barbecue is bomb - which is why you'd be visiting Famous Daves anyhow... just have an appetite for some interesting spins on the side dishes."}
{"text":"I ate here yesterday and I had the meal called the feast for one.  The prices were a little high but not un usuall for a bbq resturant.  They have these spicy pickles that are really good and their coleslaw is very good too.  The service was good and the food took about 20-25 minutes"}
{"text":"Ribs and Brisket over cooked and dry, burnt ends like beef jerky with Bbq sauce.....service bout the same high point was the grilled pineapple. At least they got something right....shame cuz other locations I have eaten at weren't bad"}
{"text":"Dave Anderson has created a chain fo BBQ restaurants that provide delicious BBQ at a reasonable price.  The feast for two is really enough for four, and the deep fried pickles are a great way to start.  But if you want a great side, their spicy dill pickles are a great accompaniment to the BBQ.  Also, if you like your sauce spicy, ask for Wilbur's Revenge sauce.  If that doesn't wake up your taste buds, nothing will."}
{"text":"We got a family meal and was very impressed with the quality and value.  The sides: Corn Bread, Mash, and Fries were probably the best I've ever had, and the BBQ was very good.  The consensus between 4 people was an excellent meal!  Lastly the packaging was very good, one big platter so we just had to open it up and start eating with no mess or hassles."}
{"text":"I wouldn't have picked a BBQ place because I don't eat beef, however, I was with my husband Dave and our kids and had to try Famous Dave's. I had the pork and it was tender and had great barbecue sauce.  For sides I chose dirty rice and broccoli which were nicely seasoned.  My kids all had cheeseburgers which they said were ok. Dave enjoyed his steak and potatoes. Over good but not great BBQ."}
{"text":"What a deal ! Lunch combo, $ 6.95. two peaces BBQ ribs, BBQ chicken breast, cold slaw. Four types of BBQ sauces Very tasty ! I'm coming back to this place for sure !"}
{"text":"racist.   foods good but service was rediculously rude, unattentive and clearly racist. *Note: this is for the Famous Dave's on Sunset."}
{"text":"These ribs are the best ever! I like the variety of sauces as well. My favorite is \"Devils Spit\". We always order the Famous Dave's Margarita to drink and they're yummy! The only reason I knocked off 1 star is the service is typically slow, good but slooow!"}
{"text":"FDBBQ is just plain tasty and this particular location is no exception.  Conveniently located in the area of the Galleria Mall or Sunset Station Hotel & Casino.  Need some BBQ before a movie, bowling or shopping then this is the place.  The service is friendly and attentive.  Lunch is my preferred time to visit as it is not very busy.  The food be it fried pickles, corn bread, BBQ brisket or the nice and dirty sweet tea is as good as it can get.  The \"As good as it gets\" means for a commercially owned, scorched animal protein sort of way."}
{"text":"I LOVE BBQ.  I haven't eaten at Dave's for almost a year and decided to order takeout. The customer service is wonderful.  The food, I was really dissapointed! The quality and flavor has changed. The Wilbur beans which once was a hit was terrible.  The sauce tasted like it was ketchup! The St. Louis ribs were hard and the recipe was different as well. I ended up tossing the sides. The cornbread muffin crumbled before it got to my mouth. The boxes have gotten bigger and the portions have gotten significantly smaller. Considering this is a BBQ place, I was super disappointed. The customer service is what is holding the 3 stars."}
{"text":"Service was decent. I had one of the brisket burgers and it was good. Fries were tasty and the variety of BBQ sauces on the table was convenient and tasty. Cornbread muffins were delicious. We were sat right away. Was not very busy on a Saturday evening."}
{"text":"For Las Vegas, this is really good barbecue. But I've been around and had some of the best ... and it doesnt match up. So if you've eaten barbecue in the south, midwest, or east coast, this will be very average fare.

If it wasnt located near me, I wouldnt make effort to go and eat here.

With that said, I recommend them. The food is very consistent, the service is great, and the place is clean."}
{"text":"Still love the Famous BBQ!  We stopped in for a lunch visit.  We were seated right away and our waitress was at our table in a flash.  She was great! Always kept our drinks filled and very pleasant!

I don't know if this was a new promotional special.... but they have a 2 for $25 deal.   This included an appetizer, two different meats in each entree and dessert to share!  We chose to go with the BBQ nachos with pork.  YUM! I love their nachos.  I thought it would be a smaller portion since it was part of their special. I was wrong!  It was a huge plate and piled high! So much toppings and they didn't skimp on the pork either!  Love it!

For my entree I had the bbq chicken and Georgia chopped pork.  This was accompanied by a half corn on the cob, one side and a corn muffin.  SO MUCH FOOD!    The bbq chicken was very moist and had a great flavor!  The Georgia chopped pork is always great.   My belly was very very happy about my meal choice! 

For the cherry on top, Bread Pudding!  I actually never tried this before I met my husband.  He got me hooked for sure! It was a huge piece that was covered with a delightful pecan sauce.  Not to mention vanilla ice cream and whipped cream on each side of it.  Oh yes.  After all of that food, I was surprised I was able to eat dessert!   SO WORTH THE CALORIES!

I love this place.  We've tried Lucilles BBQ but still would rather go to Dave's.  I think they have better BBQ sauces and much better pricing.  Just this yelpers opinion.  :-)"}
{"text":"Our waitress was Ashley she was terrible, she acted like she was on drugs .The potato salad was salty ,the ribs were salty . there food has gone downhill I will never go back there are again."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. Food was tasty as expected. Service was spot on.  Never had a problem at any Famous Dave's establishment.  Totally satisfied with my visit"}
{"text":"*NOTE: I WENT TO THE NEW FAMOUS DAVE'S ON SUNSET BUT ITS NOT LISTED YET*

Holy bananas Batman!  Every girl loves her some finger-lickin' BBQ, and Dave's has it.   They recently opening up a new location on Sunset and Stephanie (THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!!!) and I finally frequented the restaurant tonight and just wow.  Just know now that if you go there at dinner time THERE WILL BE A WAIT (why do I feel like I'm going to use capital letters throughout this entire review?  Oh because Dave's is EFFING AMAZING).  Anyway, so prepare for the wait.  They quoted us with a party of 2 for 35 mins but really was like 15.  

So we get seated.   Immediately our waiter was there, greeting us and asking if we ever been there.  After small pleasantries we ordered a few alcoholic drinks.  I got a mai tai and my boyfriend got this YoMamaPunch or something.  Either way simply DELICIOUS.  Sometimes when you go to places and order an $8 drink it tastes like poop.  Literally.  Poop.  But not this time; the drinks were perfectly blended with the right amount of alcohol and not too much sweetness.

We then ordered the feast for 2.  The menu should actually say feast for 4, but hey, its BBQ.  The ribs were falling off the bone, the brisket was melting in our mouths, and the chicken flew into our  mouths.  Not to mention the subtly sweet corn on the cob and cornbread muffins.  The baked beans had a bit of an exciting kick to them, and the mac n cheese was gone as soon as we smelled it.  

So, ya know, it was good.  

The check was quick, but not too quick, we were asked by the manager how the food tasted, the bill wasn't that expensive, and the staff even said goodbye when we left!

I will go again.  And you need to go.  Like now.  Go!"}
{"text":"Fun and delicious barbecue! 
It's been a really long time since I've been here, months actually. Tonight was dead but I didn't mind that because I didn't remember the food being as tasty as it was!
They offer a 3 course meal that is super cheap and the portions are fairly small which is perfect. It ended up being the perfect amount of food with the best little sweet bite at the end, a kahlua brownie bite with vanilla ice cream. 
I love the fact that they have 6 different sauces to choose from at your table and you can try them all! From super sweet brown sugar to intensely spicy. 
The atmosphere is very casual and on a cold evening there's a large fire place in the middle of the room which was the perfect touch. 
They have several great specials and a daily happy hour so I took a pic of the current ones."}
{"text":"I usually do not like barbecue places, but the feast for two is so delicious and it also helps that the staff is very friendly and helpful. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"The meat (brisket) was overly fatty-I understand that they need some fat while cooking to develop the flavor, but almost 1/3 of my entree was fat. The sides were good, and the service was perfectly fine, but I thought it was overpriced for what I got."}
{"text":"Famous Dave's ribs are the best in town and I've tried a lot of different barbecue houses. Their wedge potatoes are incredibly delicious and the corn bread muffins are awesome. The service is friendly and the place is clean with an open roomy atmosphere. This is one of my favorite restaurants and I recommend it to anyone who likes barbecue."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of Dave.

I've gone to this location a handful of times. I've never been too impressed.

The food is mediocre at best. Anyone can grill/smoke meat, then slather it with BBQ sauce.

The service has always been good. The servers are exceptional at conveying the menu.

The restaurant and bathrooms are always clean. 

It's not the best BBQ, but I'd go there again!"}
{"text":"For the price you can't go wrong.... we normally split the platter for 2 and always have some left over.  I am not a fan of their chicken but everything else is great. .. the Devils spit must go on everything!"}
{"text":"I just love Famous Dave's BBQ! I personally think the service, food and atmosphere is the best here in Las Vegas/Henderson whenit comes to BBQ. We love Dave's Dills (not on the menu! Just ask for them!) and all the specials they run. The flavor of the BBQ is the best and you can share a meal with someone and not eat it all! Don't waste your time with other BBQ places, just go the best!"}
{"text":"Just saw this place after visiting Galleria Mall a bit curios of the smoke ribs. It did not disappoint the smoke ribs was perfectly balance and the the chicken is moist. They have all the extra sauces on the side that was awesome and the server was very attentive to our needs. THROW AWAY YOUR GRILL just come here and eat. You'll thank me for it."}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for barbeque than this is the place to go! You get your money's worth here. Very tasty and your food comes out nice and hot. The server was very nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Don't normally care for bbq but I'm a fan of famous daves!"}
{"text":"Food is good. Very delicious and decadent. For a Sunday evening, they're busy with a lot of family members laughing and having a great time that gives an ambiance of home. The meat is cooked to perfection with the meat of the ribs falling off of the bones. The brisket is very soft and tender. This is our second time at Dave's and we will make sure we follow up with more visits. Customer service is good. We were sat in less than 15 minutes and our hostess came to our table to take our drink orders immediately. Food came out really fast and the rest is history. 
Make sure you come and visit Dave's and you will be in bbq bliss!"}
{"text":"The good news is Famous Dave's brought back the sweet jalapeño dipping sauce after removing it from the menu years ago. My catfish thanks you. 

The bad news is the brisket was tough, chewy, sinewy, funny colored and completely inedible."}
{"text":"Service was alright. At first I ordered the beef tips but that had more fat on them than meat and the taste otherwise was ok. I returned this for the ribs which did \"fall off the bone\" and are somewhat tasty provided you add a heap of bbq sauce with them. The sides I ordered were the mac and cheese and dirty rice. *sigh* the mac and cheese was watery and bland and the rice was dry and tasteless. The manager came out and introduced himself which I thought was nice. The best part of my meal was the strawberry lemonade I ordered which reminded me of koolaid 0_o. Now on to my husband's meal... he ordered the brisket which came out looking like SPAM! Lol this place is mediocre at best and everything tasted as if it was frozen then warmed up in the microwave.. yuck. Needless to say the facility was pretty clean which is always a plus. Now the best part... Me and my husband are still having the runs from eating at this place 5 days ago. Never again smh."}
{"text":"Is Very good and food very yummy waitress very fast and very polite and inside is very dark. Place Is very far from me but is worth it and very good price. They deserve the tips."}
{"text":"Food is always good. Feasts give you enough to share and reasonable priced.  Most of the time you get good service and wait times are pretty short.  Great for large groups."}
{"text":"Hubby and I have been disappointed the last few visits here, but decided to give it one more try today.  It will be our final meal there.  We arrived at 3:30 and the place was almost empty.  There were several waitstaffers milling around but it still took a long time for one of them to take our drink order, and she was obviously pissed off we had interrupted her while she was hanging with her coworkers.  We waited a long time for our food.  My husband's corn on the cob was ice cold and his cornbread muffin was stale.  I got the brisket sandwich which was terrible.  The sandwich bun was dried out and hard.  There was very little meat on the sandwich, and what little was there was cold and grisly.  I really can't believe they served such a horrible mess.  My husband's ribs were okay although barely room temperature.  We both had beans and fries, which were good.  We then waited forever for the check.  There are too many BBQ places in the area - Lucilles and Dickeys are the best - to waste your time and money here.  I also won't spend money eating at a restaurant where the waitstaff acts like it's an imposition to wait on you.  Avoid."}
{"text":"Made my order immediately.   GRUB GUB blew them off and this company had to eat the order.  Sorry guys.  And to hell with GRUB HUB.  A service you can't rate in yelp."}
{"text":"Famous Dave's is a great chain. The portions are huge and we always go home with leftovers no matter how hungry we were when we came! We have been plenty of times and rarely have planned it. Any time we were near one we followed our noses to the great smells constantly coming from the place. The macaroni is to die for and the ribs fall off the bone without struggle. Deliciousness when you feel you want to get messy while eating and have an ache for some good bbq."}
{"text":"Out of all the Famous Dave locations, me and le boyfriend love this location mostly because the service has always been amazing!  We probably come to this location at most twice a year.  Not to mention it's not that bad in price for a great an all-american bbq!

Today, we celebrated the boyfriend's \"birfday\" (his request).  I called a few hours before arriving to reserve a table for 10 people at 6pm, and they couldn't promise a reservation, but they delivered!  We only waited a few minutes after arriving for them to set up the table.  Staff was kind and friendly, and apologize if there was delay with the food. We ordered 1 all-american family feast, a feast for 2, and two other people ordered an entrees for themselves, but it was a lot of food! They were even kind enough to store the cake and put a candle on the cake, since we forgot! Lol! We love the staff here,  hence the 5 stars."}
{"text":"Good solid BBQ. You know what to expect and get it. Service is always good and ribs are great.  Just wish they served beef ribs. Oh well. Still solid BBQ"}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday with the email I got from them. Buy an entrée and two drinks get an entrée free. 
Our waitress Denise was really nice and personable. We got here right when the doors opened and it smelled like a BBQ was going on!! We got our drinks promptly, basket of their chips and a wish of Happy Birthday from our waitress.
My husband ordered the brisket platter and was informed by the waitress since it is wed. they have a special on the lunch for 9.99 :) I got the Georgia Pork. Everything was delicious. They even brought me a free chocolate sundae for my bday!!
My only complaint is the floor was really sticky under the table and the table also. My husband used the wipies and it seemed to help the table.
We will be back tho"}
{"text":"Food and service were phenomenal! The manager Timo was awesome and Christine provided us with the best service we've have in so so long. We'd give it additional stars if allowed."}
{"text":"If you love burgers..........prepare to fall madly in love!


On the new menu.........brisket grinded into burgers!!!!"}
{"text":"I love everything about this place.  It may be a little expensive, but you get a great meal, lots of it, and the service has always been fantastic.  I don't remember the waitress's name, but she was very pleasant and on top of her game.  We didn't have to wait for drinks or any other needs we may have had.  When I began placing my order she realized that what I was ordering could be ordered in a different menu selection and cost me less for essentially the same thing, so she recommended I change (which I did) and I appreciated her letting me know.  The food was fabulous."}
{"text":"I am 7mths pregnant and was craving BBQ. I ordered 2 southside rib tip meals for me and my husband for pick up and was more than satisfied. They were super quick, really friendly and the food was amazing!!!! I will definitely be going back!!"}
{"text":"Well. This was our first time going to this location.  I must say, my husband and I were impressed. We ordered the fried onions, beef brisket nachos, and hamburgers, they were ALL so delicious. 
*But*.... as usual, there is always a but, we will not give them 5 stars because the food was great but the service was mediocre. Our waitress was actually good. It was the other employees that are a negative to the place. None smiled. The hostess seemed bothered that she had to seat customers and even leaving didn't even say bye or thank you or something, ANYTHING!!!! Plus, the food took forever to be served to us. 
But like I mentioned earlier, the food was great.  So we might just have to go again knowing that if we're lucky we'll have a great waitress just not good service overall."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. Our waitress Kat was awesome, and since we had never been she advised my wife and I to try the feast for 2. Excellent choice. Came with ribs, baked beans, corn on the cob, cornbread muffins, coleslaw, 1/2 a chicken, and your choice of another bbq item and we chose the brisket. Everything was delicious. Add in the happy hour beer special of buy 1 get 1 free, and I was a happy camper."}
{"text":"Bring a large appetite here because the food is a belly buster!  I ordered the half slab of st. louis style ribs combo.  The ribs were so delicious!   Also, be sure to get their famous french fries!  They too were awesome!  I'm addicted to good bbq food, so when I find a good place, I do a double take and try again to be sure.   And so, I came here again and the food was still awesome!"}
{"text":"Really strong taste everything was covered in sauce.  My friend who like John Mull's Meats did not like Famous Dave's.  I like Rollin' Smoke Barbecue.

Hawaii guy in Vegas."}
{"text":"First off, I have eaten here exactly three times (I try to give everything a fair chance), and it is nowhere near as good as the other Famous Dave's.  The staff are depressing (no smiles), and everyone walks around like they'd rather be somewhere else.  First reason to go to a different one.  I like to go to restaurants where the staff smiles, and makes you feel welcome.
It was 11 am and our waitress wanted to know if we wanted margaritas.  Really?  At 11 am?  How many alcoholics come into this place?  She should have asked if we wanted anything to drink, and just left it at that.  Are there really that many people who are drinking before noon?  (not that I'm slamming those who do, but really)...
It took quite a long time for our food to arrive, and we only ordered hamburgers.  It wasn't full and took longer than it should have.
Lastly, and this is the one which bothers me the most - we have a punch card where if you buy 5 lunches you get one free.  Except you don't.  Unless you're a single diner.  It works like this:  When you buy a lunch they punch the card, and after 5 punches, you get a free lunch.  BUT, if there are two of you, they make you use TWO cards, so you're actually buying TEN lunches to get one.  In reality, when you buy two lunches, there should be two punches on one card.  That's the way it works at other restaurants I have cards at - they don't make you purchase two lunches and then punch it only one time.  Their little \"free lunch punch card\" is misleading and needs to be changed."}
{"text":"The wife and I decided to take our youngest daughter and her husband to Famous Dave's; she is very pregnant and realizes life as she knows it is changing forever. They are very happy and so are we, so we were glad to treat them tonight. We had a very enjoyable time; we got in line around 4:30 PM and were seated by 5:00 PM. Our son-in law had the spicy sausage, daughter had choice of two meats, wife had chicken, and I had the pulled pork (Memphis Style). Memphis style puts the slaw on the pulled pork, and that will give you another side to go with the meal. The root beer float was very good and I shared that with the wife. A very good time, for a little more fun call the phone number and ask for Ali, She cannot help you get seated any faster, nor can she make an appointment, but she is fun to talk to. So make that call!"}
{"text":"They have reasonable lunch specials. I think the rest of the menu is over priced. Went for lunch with a buy one get one half off. The bill came to $38 for two people with tip and the coupon. We drank water but the expensive plates we chose weren't even good. Ribs were dry and hard to eat. The burnt ends ended up in the trash. Mashed potatoes... How do you mess that up?  Ask Dave.  The beans were ok. The corn bread was sweet and delicious. Didn't have my water refilled till long after it was empty. Wish this place was better. The location is convenient. It's never busy but maybe this is why?"}
{"text":"Awesome BBQ ribs with amazingly hot hot sauce!  You can share the largest size and on Tuesday night they are $5 of for $17.99.  The beans, slaw, corn and cornbread are great also!  Service has also been awesome two times now.

{"text":"So the food is good but I have to say some of the staff is just flat out rude. We walked in the door at 10:35 PM on a Saturday night and we got the evil eye from the bar tender and one of the bus boys. So stupid. I promise you the owner where ever he is did not right this situation into his business plan back in the day. However, the waitress quickly learned that we did not really feel welcome and she made up for all the negativity we received from the bar area. The food was good and the service was great. I wish I could remember the waitress's name because she was great."}
{"text":"I am a 34 year old man who went in with my wife a few days after I renewed my license I wanted to try one of there new mixed drinks but when I was carded me a 34 year old 6 ft 300 lb man was carded and toled because me license was expiered  that the would not serve me. The 34 year old man so we left and I never plan to go back."}
{"text":"Food was pretty tasty but the service was sooooo slow! Although our waitress was friendly, sitting for 15 minutes without a soda refill is unacceptable! Our table had no BBQ sauce either.... So our food was dropped off, and we were not checked on for 15 minutes more, we actually had to signal for our waitress to come over; I thought she should have come on her own. It made the meal stressful because we had to be our own servers in a sense and also suffer from neglect."}
{"text":"Bummers! Ordered some sides to go, they didnt get the order correct.  Called and even though its a 25 min drive for us each  way all they could offer was to replace what they missed.  No compensation wow!"}
{"text":"The service was great and the food was awesome the ribs were so tender the meat came right off the bone , and that rub used on the chicken was screaming with flavor , it was my aunts birthday and her first time eating there and it was perfect , she lives in Calif i told her there's a famous Dave's at shoreline village in long beach or waitress was Renea and she was awesome didn't even have to ask for drink refills , we had the feast for 4-6 ppl it's well worth the cost of $62"}
{"text":"BBQ was pretty good the service was fast and friendly the sweet tea could be sweeter but all in all we had a great meal...the music sucks though couldn't wait to get out of there cause it was driving me crazy!"}
{"text":"The other night, on the 24th we dine in with my family to celebrate my birthday here. Food is great up to the bones. Sauce is awesome. But most of all, our server Mike would not make the night complete without his excellent service. He provided us with great service, attends to our needs, accommodate all our needs! Thumbs up and a shout out to Mike! Recommendable! We def sure come back here! Thank you Mike!"}
{"text":"We went here for dinner, and we're surprised at how comfortable it was there. 

We ordered the onion strings appetizer, they were a little soggy but not bad, the mayo sauce was very heavy so I didn't eat too much of it. 

For dinner we got the feast for 2 and it was such a big portion we had to bring th e rest home in 3 boxes, everything was prepaired very well. My only critic on the dinner was the sausage, which was not what I had been expecting. 

All in all we will be coming back here. I would recommend coming here if your in the mood for great bbq comfort food."}
{"text":"We decided to get bbq for dinner tonight and came to daves! When we arrived we were greated by a very friendly hostess told that there was a wait which was fine because we were waiting for friends. We waited about 15 minutes and we're finally seated. 

Our entrees were served before our appetizer, but the manager actually offered to comp the appetizer for us due to this, which was very nice. The food was great as always! Our waitress was a bit slow on the drink refills. She only smiled towards the end when we were about to pay, maybe that was her way of asking for a tip?

All of that said this location doesn't really offer anything unique besides the big greeting bear sculpture when you walk in."}
{"text":"Famous Dave's BBQ is popular for a reason and that reason is that their food is delicious and reasonably priced. The service at this location is very good and the restaurant itself is clean and a nice place to have a meal.

I'm not a BBQ connoisseur, so I can't attest to any of the finer points of BBQ. But the BBQ at Famous Dave's tastes really good to me."}
{"text":"I first heard about Famous Dave's on the food network challenge bbq show and so when I saw that there were multiple locations in Las Vegas, I had to try one out. Now I've had BBQ in a lot of different places and this is more of your restaurant style BBQ than your hole in the wall joint. For the price they charge and the amount of food they give you it is definitely worth trying out. We got to try/sample the ribs, brisket, sausage and chicken wings. All were well done, but the ribs were probably my favorite. They had numerous different sauces, none that were too spicy and I like my sauces spicy so this is something they need to work on. Overall a good place to get some BBQ at a very affordable price."}
{"text":"It been while since had my short rib action on so was looking forward too coming Famous Dave's with my sister-in-law and my nieces. The bbq short ribs never disappoint me! I use too be fan of Tony Roma still am but Famous Dave's took over the number one spot. The meat is just as tender as Tony Roma but bigger cuts of ribs so get your rib on. I really enjoy fact that get selection of sauces choose from and best of all on the table so never have ask for more sauce. I am fan of the spicy sauce and the sweet traditional one. I had rib tips also since went with two meat combo. Don't order the rib tips. I wish ordered different one they have few choices. Also have plenty choices of sides too choose from I went with mac and cheese, and baked beans. The mac and cheese could have been more creamier and more cheese. Even the baked beans nothing special both were ok. The only reason come here and excited all about the short ribs. Oh the cornbread muffins too! -) Other thing love! It always nice hot out of the oven and take top bun off see steam coming out and moist on the inside. Beautiful! My sister-in-law ordered the soup of the day wild rice soup. It was not very good at all. The soup tasted bland no depth in flavor and sad. I love the ribs have nothing but kudos.

The service not as attentive came too filling up my nieces sodas or presences during our meal. She did look busy with few tables but really not take much effort too check in once in while. I ask different waitress for refill soda for the girls. It came too getting the bill again like where did she go?

Whenever need for short ribs and cornbread muffin Famous Dave's my go spot! ONly reason not get four star two things nothing much wow factor. The wow I do enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Well, quite simply the food is amazing and will leave you wanting more. The ribs are awesome. The BURGERS are made from brisket and yes it makes a HUGE difference is taste. The drinks are tasty too.

The SERVICE however is lacking on some days.......hmmmmm"}
{"text":"Great service, very attentive waitress and manager asked every customer if the service was up to par..."}
{"text":"This place is ok...rib tips were kind of hard and brisket was overcooked. Overpriced for what you get and nothing like real Texas BBQ"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for years now when one opened in Buffalo, NY where I'm originally from. It's taken me 3-4 years! lol  I've always gotten great bbq at Lucille's out here in Vegas, so Famous Dave's opening right around the corner from my house was exciting. BF and I went in on Friday around 4pm.  We had the onion straws for an appetizer and they were good, buttery taste to them. I liked them better than Lucille's actually.  The remoulade that came with it was so good! He ordered the brisket and the special they had going on, buck a bone which was that you can order up to 6 ribs for a buck a piece to your entree. I ordered the pulled chicken sandwich memphis style with coleslaw on it. My side was the spicy green beans, and his sides were bbq baked beans and garlic mashed potatoes. The brisket for him was disappointing. It was tough, and overcooked it seemed. The waiter gladly let him order something else so he had the pork platter which was just the meat and bread since he already had a full plate.  Waiter's name was Mike, and he was awesome! He let bf take the brisket home. My chicken sandwich was great! The sauce was perfect, the slaw was tasty, green beans were meh...needs more butter or something on them and the bacon needs to be cooked or something.  Overall, it was a great experience! As I type this, brisket is still in the fridge, so BF is not a fan."}
{"text":"After a long morning at The Color Run, the dynamic trio finally made it to Famous Daves BBQ. We were immediately greeted by an insanely sweet server who went above and beyond to make sure everyone was satisfied.

While waiting for our food, our server brought us some great BBQ chips to sample different sauces (we had a toss up between sweet and spicy and devil's spit). We ordered the onion straws for an appetizer and were not disappointed.

At our table we ordered beef brisket, pulled pork, and ribs. The side of jalapeno mac and cheese was a hit. All of the meats were awesome too (nothing was left but empty plates). The ribs fell off the bone, but were almost a little too mushy.

At the end of our meal the manager came over and introduced herself. She thanked us for visiting and gave us a free bottle of our favorite bbq sauce. I thought this was a great way to get us to come back and a tactic that is rarely seen these days.

 All in all it wasnt the absolute greatest bbq but the service made it a reason I will most likely be back for more"}
{"text":"Great food, best ribs in town. Great sauces too. Pricey though, and always a wait on weekends. Call and Make a reservation. The full rack is filling a great meal!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last night.Shared a burnt ends and rib combo with cole slaw,broccoli,and a corn muffin.We also shared a caesars salad,which was good.We had just started on the salad when the entree came out barely warm.The server offered to microwave it .No thanks.They had plenty of time to heat the entree while we were eating the salad,why bring it out too soon and nearly cold?Ribs were tough,not falling off the bone,burnt ends were good,broccoli was good.Corn muffins were a zero,dry no taste.Cole slaw needed help too,no taste,dry.Service was ok.No reason to go back.Lots of places have better bbq."}
{"text":"I came here because I love their sauce and figured that their BBQ would be good also. I was a bit disappointed, to be honest.

Came for lunch and ordered the lunch special ribs with sausage and brisket. The ribs were good so I can't complain about them. The sausage?... I've had better. The brisket was a bit dry and flavorless... had it not been for me adding a good amount of their sauce that they have ready on the tables. 

The service was really good but I was disappointed with the food. I would hate to think that they were relying on their food to compliment their BBQ sauces and not the other way around.

I have no problem going back if I'm in the neighborhood... but I'd rather spend my money for BBQ at Pot Liquor in Town Square."}
{"text":"I had a pulled chicken sandwich with Mac n cheese. The sandwich was pretty good! I've had pulled chicken before and this was a bit chunky compared to what I had before, but it was still pretty yummy. I felt like it could have had more flavor though, it was like they basically smothered it with sauce so they could cover up the fact the chicken had no taste. But it filled me up well... The Mac n cheese was seriously bland. I didn't taste a thing while eating it, it was odd. I felt fine after so at least no poisoning. But I wish I could have tasted more of my food, maybe next time? I liked their menu! Service was great!!! The food came before I knew it!! That was very impressive! I like the quickness for sure!"}
{"text":"Quick, delicious, not too overpriced. Great place to bring the family, or just go ham all by yourself."}
{"text":"I gave this place 3 out of 5 stars, It's kinda like that nice guy you'll hangout with but would never tell your friends about.  The food is decent, but I had better."}
{"text":"1st time on a Sunday afternoon. Manager and staff very helpful on what to order. Wonderful service. Happy hour menu on Sunday is grrreat. Everything was delicious."}
{"text":"Dined here late on a Sunday evening. By the following Monday morning I was quite ill with severe nausea, cramps, headache and fever. I am in the hospitality business and know the symptoms caused by improper food handling. In addition on the Southern Nevada Health District website you can see deficiencies in their most recent inspection. Contact with this chain resulted in no contact from the restaurant manager but a referral to their insurance company, who not surprisingly disagrees that I was sick. I only gave one star because zero is not an option."}
{"text":"The service was great, but the food not so much. The ribs were all fat. I got about 1 bite off of each of them. The nachos were incredibly salty and there were about 5 chips buried under all toppings. I used to love this place but the quality of food has really gone down. We definitely won't be back. And what the hell is that loud ass train sounding thing that keeps going off?"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever! Sat at the bar on a busy day so we expected some what of a wait, but what we experienced was far beyond expectations. After about 20 minutes pur order was taken, after several patrons that entered after us had their orders taken first. 40 minutes after that those that ordered around the same time as us got their food. At about one hour and fifteen minutes our food still hadn't arrived. They assured us it was coming soon. When we asked why the persons that ordered immediately before us had gotten their food about 30 minutes ago, they had no answer. I've eaten plenty of BBQ, normally things like we ordered are prepared in big quantities so service is never an issue. Famous Daves must have the most screwed up kitchen in town if they can't get you two orders of beef brisket within and hour and a half! Finally I flagged down the manager, he was apathetic. We left an hour and a half after arrival, no food. Just a new found desire to spare as many people from visiting Famous Daves as possible."}
{"text":"To me Famous Dave's isn't bad, but it is not my first pick for BBQ either. I enjoy the variety of sauces at every table, and on 2 occasions (not this last one) have been offered the sauce tour where they explain each one to you. Very amusing and helpful in choosing which fits you. I like spicy so I go with the devils spit or the mustard looking one. I even mix the 2 sometimes. (Trust me on that- BOMB) 
I ordered the 2 meat combo with cod and a hotlink. The cod was cooked perfect and had a yummy crust. The hotlink was just ok. I enjoyed my daughters potato salad more than my garlic mashed red taters. Our waitress Tashalee (I think I got that right) was pretty on top of it. She even had some small Super Bowl talk with us and was adamant about making sure we were satisfied at all times. She would get 5 stars. 
I'd come back to this location. However I'd be lying if I said it was my favorite BBQ in town."}
{"text":"I go to the LVAC  that's near this location and it always smells amazing so I finally decided to go with the husband for BBQ. The 3 portion meal was perfect size for me. My pork ribs were delicious and tried ask the sauces they had to offer that were on the table.  Mashed potatoes had a good flavor too. The chocolate brownie desert was great at the end.  My husband got a meat variety plate that had a nice variety choices. Overall,  everything was fantastic. Our waitress was friendly and bit overbearing and everything was timed nicely.  Definitely week be returning."}
{"text":"Came for valentines day dinner early to beat the crowd. Ordered the Feast special, food was excellent.  The brownie dessert  was amazing.  server Rene was the best, made us feel right at home. Will be back to have her as our server."}
{"text":"Omg I always come here because the food is so damn good! Great selection and everything on the menu is amazing. Friendly Staff, take out orders are quick, I'm never disappointed!"}
{"text":"I ordered to go and when I got there 15 minutes after I ordered, the food was ready to go. We got ribs and spicy mac and cheese.  The spicy mac and cheese is a favorite of ours.  The ribs, as one other reviewer stated, do have some of the smaller bones and aren't of perfect quality, but they are cooked to near perfection.  The only other ding I would give is that the large sides are significantly smaller in size than they were a year ago.  But I would still give this place 4 1/2 stars if they had a half star rating."}
{"text":"Daves is a good middle class BBQ joint it's not uber cheap and blan like some hole in the wall places also it's not overly pricey like the upscale ones. They used to give you free chips but they stopped :(. I usually split the que for 2 (WHICH IS NOT ON THE MENU ANYMORE BUT THEY STILL OFFER IT) or go during lunch hours and get one of their great lunch deals. My favorite is their pork, whether it be chopped or on ribs they have very delicious pork. A favorite side dish of mine is the Jalapeno mac n cheese. Even the burgers they offer are pretty good. Also you have about 8 different delicious BBQ sauces to dunk your food in, all have their own unique flavor. The staff has always been nice to me. And for those complaining about the decor , your'e not eating the decorations who cares what's on the wall as long as the foods good."}
{"text":"Bottom line: Bad service but delicious food! 

We sat with empty cups for more than half of our meal and didn't get refills until long after we brought it to the attention of our server. Out of the three of us that we're dining together they only got one of our orders right. The server actually had an attitude with us as well. We didn't like that too much! 

Will not be visiting this location again! 

They only get two stars because they have good food. They also don't give you very big portions. They are cheap with their sides"}
{"text":"Everything about this place is just okay. From the ambience, food, service, and everything in between.

I've been to this Famous Dave's location a handful of times and nothing really stands out to me. The restaurant is located right next to the Galleria Mall at Sunset and is rarely ever busy... At least the times I've dined here.

During my most recent visit with my boyfriend, there was a short 10 minute wait. We arrived and there were two parties ahead of us, both couples as well. The host then proceeded to call another couple who arrived after us and had it not been for the couple letting the host know that we were supposed to be seated before them, we would've still been waiting. The host did this twice in the ten minutes that we were waiting there.

We sat at a table next to the bar and already had an idea of what we were going to order. We both ordered the Two-Meat Combo. You choose two meats (obviously) and it's served with two sides and a corn bread muffin. I chose the Texas Beef Brisket and chicken tenders with Famous Fries and Wilbur Beans. I was disappointed with the brisket because it was way too dry and it was flavored just like beef jerky. If I wanted beef jerky, I could've gone to Terrible Herbst down the street. Yes, I was that person who ordered chicken tenders at a BBQ joint. What a mistake! The chicken tenders were also dry and had no type of seasoning in the breading whatsoever. My sides were decent. You can't possibly go wrong with potato wedges! I probably wouldn't order the Wilbur Beans again. This dish was more like a soup and not thickened like the type of baked beans that I'm used to.

The best thing about Famous Dave's is their signature BBQ sauces. Each sauce is available for you to try at your table! My favorite is definitely the Georgia Mustard. It's tangy and has just the right amount of heat! The Georgia Mustard went on everything.

Like I said, this place is just okay. I probably won't be returning here for a while!"}
{"text":"Being from Texas we eat bbq often so perhaps my expectation that BBQ ribs should not be tough & undercooked is unreasonable. Not. Waitress noticed that we weren't eating them & declined a to go box so she was bright enough to ask why. When I told her she let her manager know. Also a good move. Manager then stops by our table & offers to give us more of the same undercooked ribs. Ummmm, no I don't think so. I believe he needs to go back thru restaurant management 101. Who wants more of what they just didn't eat because it's undercooked ? His explanation was we've been busy & didn't have enough cooked thoroughly. Well then DON'T serve them !
Who wants to pay a fair amount of $$ for something inedible ?? Says he can't comp anything off our bill, he needed the higher level Mgr to bless it & he wasn't present. I didn't ask for a reduction but having worked in the restaurant industry when younger, this would have been a total comp situation. Perhaps isolated incident but we won't be returning. Train your staff before you leave them without the authority to resolve a food quality issue. 

This info is for brother Yelpers. Not looking to be contacted by this restaurant's management for any comp, I wouldn't eat there again."}
{"text":"Awesome service. Our server was super attentive. The food was really good I had the ribs and the BBQ chicken and it was so good. I also had mashed potatoes and they were real not instant.  The decor was fun and super retro."}
{"text":"Aaron is a great server and the food is really good! The brisket is a Lille dry but the pulled pork is so good! Great mashed potatoes and great Mac n cheese! Will be back. (:"}
{"text":"Great food.

Rene is the best waiter EVER. 

Ask for her, super nice.

Easy parking, sports."}
{"text":"OMG! i had the best experience today! their service was on point! we had a server annette, she was excellent and funny! they had 6 different sauces to choose from and she gave a very descriptive \"sauce tour\". it was cute! i ordered bbq chicken that comes with corn on a cob, cornbread and two sides. jalepeno mac and cheese and garlic mashed potatoes sides were so delicious! i loved their cornbread! definitely consider sharing cause everyone in our party couldn't finish their meals!"}
{"text":"Service was \"okay\" the BBQ IS DECENT but I come here for my family they love it ! I'm on a Keto diet so I ordered the Dave's burger minus the bun ,it was great except this pitiful wedge like lettuce they offered. Overall the sauce is good  meat is tasty. Server was easily overwhelmed."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum!!  We had great service and the food was very good.  This was my first time to Famous Dave's and was very pleased.  I had the ribs and the hot link and they were so delicious.  And I am not a fan of corn bread but it was sooooooo good.  I personally love this place, two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Good food absolutely terrible service.  The place could be empty and they still make you wait for a seat."}
{"text":"My friend and I were feening for some good BBQ and a lot of my friends recommended this place! Right when we walked in it took a couple minutes for us to get seated because there was nobody at the front. Once she finally showed up we got seated very quickly. My friend and I both ordered the beef brisket. With the beef brisket you are able to choose whatever two sides, I got potato wedges and sweet corn, and my friend got potato wedges and cole slaw. Our waitress got one of our orders wrong, and when we told her it was wrong she looked at us so confused like we were crazy? Also it took her forever to bring out ranch? It wasn't even busy at the restaurant! Also I don't know why, but our table we sat at was the only table around us that didn't have their little tray of different BBQ sauces. We didn't even realize until we finished our food, because it was our first time there. The beef brisket was very dry and tough, I wasn't able to finish it. Our waitress only came back to check up on our table like once or twice and it took her forever to come bring us a togo box and check. I don't think I'll be coming back here, unless someone would offer to pay for my food haha."}
{"text":"Luckily, my son and I arrived a bit before 5 pm, and were very glad we did, as the dining room started filling up very quickly when the 5 o'clock hour hit.  I suggest if you don't have time to wait, do like we did and get here early for dinner.  If you have time to wait, do it...you'll be glad you did, eating here is worth almost any amount of waiting time.

As usual, my son ordered his full rack of baby back ribs, with corn (sweet and tender!) and fries as his sides that came with his dinner.  He ordered an add-on dinner salad for only $2.49 extra, which I ate, and it was not only very large, but loaded with extras, including chopped hard boiled egg, cucumber, tomatoes, cheese, etc.  It was not a disappointing lettuce-and-croutons-only salad, that's for sure!  

Our server kindly suggested that the basket of chicken wings I ordered be made \"plain\" since my son and I have very different tastes when it comes to the type of sauces we prefer on our wings.  This was an excellent suggestion, and I am passing it along to y'all because you'll end up with crispy-skin wings that you can dress with any of a half a dozen different barbeque sauces that are right at your table at all times.

NOTE! The wing basket comes with carrot and celery sticks (YUM!) so ask for them to be served on the side, in a different basket so the waters from the vegetables don't get your wings soggy or, as my son said, \"contaminate\" your wings, lol.

We had great service, as we always do here.  The parking is ample, being in the mall parking lot.  There's plenty of handicapped parking in front too.  Being next to the mall, dining here after a long shopping day makes for an excellent ending to a beautiful day out."}
{"text":"This is a decent steakhouse if you're looking for a quick dinner on a Friday with little to no wait. Food is good and sides are better than average."}
{"text":"Well here again not much has changed. Brisket is really fatty, 4 out of the 5 ribs are good. Last one was all gristle. Salad was rubbery and the side where ok. 

Oh well"}
{"text":"I always get meaty ribs when I come here until tonight. It was no problem, they replaced with super meaty ones and a couple extra to boot! Thanks Famous Dave's!"}
{"text":"Always a good place to eat when craving some BBQ. For a large food chain, the food is good. BBQ sauce is smokin', priced fair for the portions and the staff is always very nice. Cornbread is a must!"}
{"text":"Famous Dave's offers good bbq at a reasonable price.  They use a gas cooking method, so it is not smoked traditionally.

I have found the food and service here to be good and reliable.  Particular items I have enjoyed include the beef brisket (best thing on their menu), beans, and their desserts are very good and of a sharing size (particularly the bread pudding and the pecan pie).

Good option for a family restaurant."}
{"text":"Wonderful BBQ place, and definitely something that I didn't expect when I moved away from the South.  I personally partake in their to-go area a lot mainly because it's a lot of good southern cooking, and usually it's a pretty quick turn around.

I personally love their St. Louis style BBQ ribs, which is very succulent, and absolutely fantastic tasting.  The Famous Dave's BBQ sauce is also a lot sweeter and definitely one of the better BBQ sauces.  It's more like Kansas City and Texas, and less like the vinegary North Carolina style.

To date, we haven't had any issues with to-go, of which is definitely good since there seems to be a lot of forgetful kitchens where they forget to place items in for to-go orders.  At least in my experience."}
{"text":"Bartender said ribs were fall off the bone ribs.
They were far from.
$17 for tough ribs.
I should have sent them back."}
{"text":"Not impressed with portion of food served. Normally we can't finish our plates. I however was impressed with the fast service as they brought our food out within 10 minuets of ordering it."}
{"text":"I was really surprised that the food was just ok. Not even good. I was craving bbq for a while and remembered Famous Daves being pretty decent so my family and I went for an earlier dinner on a Saturday night a couple of weeks earlier.

They were not too busy, we were seated in about 5 minutes. i ordered the 2 meat combo that included brisket and chopped pork. Both were on the dry side. The brisket had great flavor and was tender but overcooked. The pork was not chopped pork like i had in San Diego. it was pork chunks and lacked the moisture that I had at other locations. The dirty rice side dish was excellent! very moist and flavorful. 

My kids chicken tender meals were anything but tender. Also dry and hard. my kids nor my husband and I even touched the chicken. 
 
Our server was nice enough. Overall the food just wasn't that great so I really doubt I will be going back any time soon. 

Wish we had a Phil's BBQ in Vegas!!!!"}
{"text":"Lunch today was awesome....
We all had the 1/2 rack ribs and mac n cheese steamed broccoli... 

Service was very good during a busy Holiday !!"}
{"text":"Terrible!!! We were craving ribs and grabbed dinner here. Never again. We ordered the same exact thing but somehow my ribs were burned and inedible and the hubby's ribs were meaty and delicious looking, but so salty it burnt my tongue. Only reason I'm not leaving 1 Star is the sides were pretty good. But if your specialty is ribs and bbq that's not great."}
{"text":"I love this BBQ. You can't go with something anybody can eat. The BBQ brisket of course is my favorite but the samplers and the feasts are to die for as well. Everyone can get a little bit of everything to enjoy or A LOT depending on your party size. You don't have to get BBQ either. That's why all can be happy. I have always left with leftovers to enjoy for lunch the next day and it's still just as good. The service is good and  sometimes your there when it's packed and I understand that or sometimes you get somebody in training but the service will still be good.. I do prefer dine in over take out. Just incase you need any extra goodness like the amazing sauces. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Not sure what all the complaints are about re the staff. They were very nice and attentive to me. The BBQ, however, is not so great. Inexpensive, but for a small amount more you could go to the Red Rock Casino and have vastly superior BBQ."}
{"text":"My go to bar. I am there 2 or 3 times a week.
Spend about $400 a month there.
Manager refused to by a round on the house!
Really !!!
U gotta be kidding!
Won't go back!!!
Find another bar!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love Dave's Q! In search of some comfort food? This is the place. Bummer they stopped happy houring food. What were you thinking Dave?????"}
{"text":"Keep coming here ever since my cousin first took me here. I used to be a Tony Romas fan but now I am a Famous Dave fan now. The service is always good and the food is very tasty and delicious. The BBQ ribs are the tastiest ribs you will ever taste including the sauces they have. 100% would recommend to my friends."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere and the staff is really nice, but the food is only average. The cost of the food is on par with most sit down restaurant chains.  If you are wanting some good BBQ food, I would look somewhere else.  Lucille's is close, but a little pricier. Memphis BBQ is amazing and extremely reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Wow, some of the best ribs, great sides and good portions! The wife and I split a full rack of St. Louis ribs, with a huge baked potato and a couple of sides. We had enough for a nice snack the next day."}
{"text":"My family and I recently went to this Famous Dave's location after a long day of shopping.  It was around 6:30 pm.  We were seated pretty fast and service was decent.  Food was okay had better.  Walked out of the restaurant and this is where the problem begins.  Our car had been broken into.  Window smashed and things stolen.  Car was parked right against the place near the entrance.  I went back in to see if anyone had seen anything when the hostess informed me someone had come in a half hour ago and reported it.  Well thanks for trying to find the owner of the car.  The manager came out but offered really nothing and basically ran inside when the police came never to be seen again.  The general manager was suppose to come out but never did.  I had to search for someone to clean up the glass.  I just think this is poor customer care.  I was at their place eating parked in their parking lot.  We were informed this isn't the first time this has happened there either.  I did contact the company by email, got a generic response that is suppose to be forwarded on but haven't heard anything else.  I know my family and I will not be returning to this location and if they never respond to my email probably any other location because that just tells me they don't care about their customers.  I suggested too you should think twice before parking your car there because it will probably happen again,."}
{"text":"For 4 people we had the \"serves 2-3 people platter\" which included brisket, chicken, & ribs, beans, coleslaw, potato fries, & cornbread & still had leftovers but are glad we didn't order the \"serves 6-7 people platter\".  Everything was great & we got to try all of the sauces with everyone choosing their own fave, mine was the spicy one with the devil on the bottle!"}
{"text":"2 stars for the manager that swings by each table to see how your meal is.

I appreciate that he does that so I don't tell him that the number of flies at this location is alarming. I also don't say anything about the lack of air conditioning. All three things are standard at this location.
The food is just okay. The meat and sides are 10 times tastier at the Rainbow location. If I am in the mood for BBQ, I will pass on this location and drive to the other location to satisfy the craving.

Enjoy. If you want an authentic picnic experience of heat and flies."}
{"text":"I'm not much of a meat eater, but was craving some BBQ one night after a long day at work. We arrived around 8:30 and it was dead. Our server only had three tables, so when it took her ten minutes to get our drink I was a little irritated. The food wasn't what I remembered of Famous Dave's. The brisket was the only thing I enjoyed off of the platter for two. The sides were bland and the meat had tons of fat on it. When it was time to pay, I had to ASK for  refill and then never received it. My server was Tashalee, so if you go make sure you DON'T get her as your server."}
{"text":"Seriously this is the best bar b q place in town. They have a variety of diffrent sauces at your table. The rib tips are the best such huge portions. Now the mashed potatoes are seriously crazy good! The chili was not very good and upset my stomach. But overal service is great, food is amazing, and the portions are outrageously huge. A must try, this is the best BBQ in town people !!"}
{"text":"After a few months of service hiccups Famous Dave's on Flamingo got it right. It's perfect for Saturday lunch when the crowds are not too heavy. The baked potato for lunch is my favorite and you have to kick it off with fried pickles. 

Having the packaged hand wipes on the table is a great move. Anyone can clean up after the meal because sometimes you just gotta lick your fingers here."}
{"text":"The Feast for Two easily feeds 3 people for $38 plus you can sub out the soggy corn for a different side (upcharge).  Ours came with:

- pulled pork  5  stars
- Ribs  5  stars
- chicken  4  stars

  SIDES
- beans 5 stars
- salted fries 5 stars
- pineapple planks (no Cajon) 5 stars
- Mac and cheese  5 stars


We had boxed leftovers too!  I wish the AC wasn't on 60 degrees!"}
{"text":"Good spot to come when you want some simple BBQ. It's hit or miss here, sometimes the ribs are dry as well as the brisket. But other times it's fall off the bone amazing and delicious. They have about 4 or 5 types of sauce. And amazing drinks. Can't lie the drinks here are pretty damn good. I personally always sit at the bar, but I know it's VERY family friendly. So anytime you feel like some quick good BBQ check it out. Oh, and the service was super good. From what I have seen everyone is friendly."}
{"text":"We've gotten take out from here a couple of times and eaten there once. Everytime the food was great!

Our dine in experience there was pleasant as well.

Never had a complaint and love their food."}
{"text":"Ate there on yesterday (19 March 2017) at around 5P.  I wish that I had gotten the name of the waitress.  She was really mean.  My husband and I were afraid to ask questions because when we did she would bite our heads off.  Her facial expressions were mean as well as her hand gestures.  We ended up with food that we didn't want just because we did not want to upset the waitress.

I also would like to mention that FD's should not get into the fried chicken business.  It doesn't fit the theme and it was over cooked based on sight and taste.  Our mean waitress said it would not be taken off our bill, but the manager did take it off."}
{"text":"Good enough barbecue, but Lucille's is much better.  I like the hot barbecue sauce."}
{"text":"Dry meat and soggy vegetables. Too bad."}
{"text":"Repeatedly bad hard stale leather like old rib tips I repeat ripp-off.too many times. Just discard your old meat thats been sitting around and stop passing it off in your carry-out orders."}
{"text":"After a couple of years of looking, I know that there are no great bbq restaurants in the LV area. I've come to like Famous Dave's as much for what it is as for what it isn't and for simply not sucking as much as the rest. 

First of all, the food is good and the service is good. I'd give 3.5 stars if I could. 

Anyone with a closed minded singular view of bbq, such as texas  or carolina or memphis or santa rosa is sure to find it all wrong. However, If you enjoy slow cooked meat, you'll find something to like at Famous Dave's. They have a variety of meats and styles and sauces and sides etc, there is something for everyone. When I have a craving for ribs, I now go to Famous Dave's. It is far easier and cheaper than doing it myself or going to L.A.

As for how it sucks less than the rest - The service is always good and friendly. The table, menus etc are always clean. They have comfortable seating.They have metal cutlery, not horrible little plastic things. They have never been out of anything or \"not ready yet\" either. They don't act like my showing up has interfered with their day, they even act glad to have me there, all of which puts them far ahead of every other place in town I've tried."}
{"text":"Myself and my wife have been going to Famous Dave's before they came to Henderson. We have traveled to both the Rainbow and Blue diamond location before the Henderson  one was built. We USE to like to go twice a week, now, we will probably go back to our old place: Memphis BBQ. We just went the other day, to Dave's, Tuesday and wouldn't you know they \"took away\" the everyday specials and the catfish!!  No more Big Rib Tuesdays, Beef it up Wednesday's, wing specials, ect...\"Thanks Dave\"!!  just like the rest of the money hungry restaurants here in Vegas and Henderson!!  Tease people for a few months and then........\"BAM!!  take away the specials. What you get now is a small bowl of crusty, burnt, three day old wannabe potato chips that I would not give to a homeless person. That's typical, we've  all seen it before and will continue to see it later.  Hey here's a little side note. Have you ever seen \"ALL\" of these places closing up due too GREED??? I know we have and if they keep going the way they are they will fall right in behind the rest. This \"WAS\" a nice place to go and eat fairly cheep. But now....better keep drivin by. Your best bet is to go to Memphis BBQ.  At least Mike Mill's has his daily specials!!!!!  They have been here in Vegas WAY longer than Famous Dave's has.  Good luck, Dave!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Famous Dave's 2 meat lunch special $9.99. I always get the St. Louis Ribs and the BBQ wings (sweet and sassy BBQ flavor). You get two ribs, six wings, one side and a corn muffin. The wings are always very  flavorful. The ribs have a bit of smoke with a nice sweetness to them. Their potato salad is clearly made fresh and is very good too. I also ordered a side salad ($3.49) and it was a good size and fresh! Additional sides are reasonably priced at $2.49.
Our to go order was packaged nicely. It took us 30 minutes to get home and everything was still intact and food stayed warm."}
{"text":"USED TO BE one of my favorite happy hour spots but I will NEVER go to another famous Dave's again in my life. The past couple times I went the servers had no idea about happy hour we had to ask 5 people before someone finally told us what the specials were. We went back today and DOUBLE CHECKED THE WEBSITE BEFORE WE LEFT to make sure they still had happy hour and of course the website said \"Saturday and Sunday happy hour all day at the bar\". This improperly trained wait staff again had no idea about happy hour but then when we got passed around from person to person we finally spoke with a manager who informed us that they NO LONGER HONOR HAPPY HOUR despite the fact that it's CLEARLY listed on the website. Then when we expressed our frustrations they offered no accommodations for their obvious mistake. It is 2018, Accurate information on a website is not only expected, but a necessity. ESP from a larger chain such as Famous Dave's."}
{"text":"I've been to this location three times, at three different times a day, and it is always LOUSY.  Never again.   How Famous Dave's has won any awards is beyond comprehension.  The food is mediocre at best.  It is never hot, always lukewarm like it's been microwaved.  The brisket should NEVER come with sauce on it.  As a Texan, that is against the law there!  It is fatty, too.  The last time I went in was to try the Cheese Covered Burnt Ends that they ran commercials for.  It failed to say in the commercials that they are \"Jalapeno Cheese\" Burnt Ends.  That is quite an omission.  And even worse than the food there, is the HORRIBLE service.  All three times, I've had servers that looked like it was a chore to serve me.  The Blue Diamond location is slightly better, especially the service.  But as a Texan, who has eaten some of the greatest BBQ ever, I can say that \"Famous Dave\" should be ashamed of this stuff.  And this location needs a major overhaul."}
{"text":"The margarita's and the chopped pork were good, and my waiter was great. Sadly, the rest of the food was lacking. The macaroni cheese was clearly velveeta over some overcooked noodles. Good homestyle mac and cheese would have at least had the addition of some real cheese to firm it up a bit. The green beans.. Well, it was clear that someone heard the idea green beans with bacon, and just ran with it without ever having had them before. Green beans steamed to almost limpness, with a few bacon bits tossed on top, as a last minute half assed effort. Meh, I'll just go downtown and get Rollin' Smoke next time I have a craving."}
{"text":"As far as BBQ outside of Kansas City goes, this place rocks.  Large portions, outstanding side-dishes, and several choices of sauce on the table - you won't leave here hungry!  

Its obvious the cook their meats low and slow. The ribs are tender and fall off the bone.  For sides, they offer several options, including drunken apples, Wilbur beans (which are blended with smoked pork, Texas beef brisket, hot link sausage and jalapeño peppers)  Mac & cheese, redskinned mash potatoes and their famous fries. They also have healthier side dish options like Green beans and broccoli.   If you like spicy sauce, like I do, try the Devil's spit . . . so GOOD!

I never have room for dessert, but they have some good looking sweets available."}
{"text":"First time here and thoroughly impressed! The manager came by to greet me not even 30 seconds after taking a seat. My server is friendly and full of energy. I asked for his recommendation regarding my order and he articulated very well! I had not tried one of the items I was asking recommendation on and he brought me a free sample to see if I liked it. Then after discovering I had not been here before my server took me on a \"sauce tour\" breaking down all their bbq sauces while I sampled them. Each sauce is amazing in its own right! You sample the sauces with their house made potato chips which are fantastic as well. My meal was delicious! If I could give more than 5 stars I would...no wonder they are called Famous Dave's!"}
{"text":"The mac and cheese and ribs were great.  We had a party of twenty and it took over two hours for me to get my food! I got two refills of tea during three hours i was there!  Don't  do a large party. They can't really accomadate you. The cornbread is just sweet cornbread. Nothing special about it. The meats definately were exceptional otherwise i would have given no stars. Had the service been good i would rate a 4!"}
{"text":"We've been here twice in the past month and both times had an outstanding experience. The rib and burnt end combo was excellent. Sides are mostly very good. Wasn't crazy about the Mac and cheese...a little too creamy for me but most people probably like it that way. The ribs are excellent. Tender and flavorful. Last time I had the cedar plank salmon. Delish. The corn muffins are out of this world. Great service both times. Friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Eating in the bar tonight. Clean, great food and great service. But being from .CA and the micro brew capital of the us I'm having a rough time choosing a beer. That's just me being a snob though. Haha"}
{"text":"Terrible service I mean terrible didn't even refill our drinks at all and I could see the waitress flirting in the back while we were waiting to even order our food."}
{"text":"Cockroach running up the wall next to us while we were dining there last night. Waitress was extremely apologetic, but we were not comped or anything by the manager. Not that we were expecting to be comped, it's just that it's not the way I would personally run my business. Well they didn't catch the roach, and it didn't seem to bother the manager that much.

That said, the food was delicious. Too bad the roach had already spoiled our appetite...can't help but wonder if there were any critters in the kitchen as well."}
{"text":"We've been a fan of Famous Daves for several years now, driving across town to the location on Blue Diamond Road because it was worth the drive from Henderson. Now that there is a location near us we were pleased to have a Famous Daves close by. The Henderson location was just as good as the Blue Diamond restaurant, but something changed las year and the last Que for 2 was pretty lousy. I acutally like the BBQ burger instead, but the place should have good BBQ ribs, but sadly something has changed it's tough, soggy ribs with no real taste like it used to be. I left uneaten meat that is fatty left on the bone. The sides are tiny tiny and they seem to be saving on product for some reason. Even the corn bread muffin is 1/3 the size it used to be. I could go on and on, but why waste time typing here? this place is lousy, Famous Dave should be ashamed. I'll pay a bit more and head back to Lucilles BBQ in Green Valley."}
{"text":"Not bad! Not bad! I was craving some good chicken bbq. So I asked the hubs if we could come here. I think the last time I've been to a Famous Dave's BBQ was 6 years ago in Washington. It wasn't too crowded and we got seated pretty fast. I mean we didn't have the kids so it was easy for a party of 2. 

We both ordered the bbq chicken and side salad. Ok I got the side salad the hubs got the mash, corn bread and beans.  We didn't want to go over board this dinner.  Just was a simple chicken bbq dinner. The chicken was cook so good and juicy. The side salad is well a side salad. The hubs mash, beans and corn bread was oh so yummy.  I added a little bit more bbq sauce since it's right on the table."}
{"text":"Best part was the service! This is one of the few restaurants that didn't look at my funny or give me an attitude when I asked for a virgin margarita. In fact it was extremely tasty and hit the spot! Since I am not used to southern cooking, some of the stuff tasted a little weird to me, but their wings and the sauces are yummy and the service has been really outstanding. Waiters/waitresses went out of their way to figure out what had dairy and what didn't for me (I don't do milk) and that made an impression on me."}
{"text":"I've been to several events catered by Famous Dave's and have ventured inside the restaurant on several occasions. I have never really been let down by Dave's, but have never really been blown away by any of the items I've eaten.

I applaud that the interior and exterior is decorated perfectly in an unabashed country backyard BBQ fashion! Typically there is a very short wait before you are seated and the joint is pretty big and able to seat quite a large number of customers. I have never had an issue with the service and was quite pleased with the friendliness of the staff.

The items I have had from Dave's include the brisket, ribs, jalapeno macaroni and cheese, corn bread, and I have sampled their brownies. I thought that the brisket and ribs were Dave's strong suit as they should be at an establishment such as this. The meat was moist and tender with just the right amount of BBQ sauce and of course if you did need more sauce, several different kind of BBQ sauce bottles are available on each table. As for the jalapeno macaroni and cheese I have heard everyone rave about, I was not that impressed. Don't get me wrong, it was good! Unfortunately it was not my favorite mac n' cheese I've ever had. The cornbread was decent and on-par with that of Cracker Barrel's, if I had to compare. The brownies were a bit dry but did come with a bit of chocolate sauce that fell short of remedying this issue.

One item that did catch my eye on the menu were the cheesy burnt tips which I will have to come back try, so an updated review may be forthcoming in the near future!"}
{"text":"Famous daves never disappoints. I recommend having the Q for 2. All you want in one dish."}
{"text":"When we walked in, it smelled so good and my boyfriend and I were excited! We sat at a very huge booth.
Server came over and got us our drinks and he was super nice. I got an ice tea with Splenda and when there was none at the table, he said he'd go find some. Waiting and waiting, we get our appetizers and food before he remembers that he couldn't find any. A good 30 minutes without anything to drink, because he couldn't find it and forgot to tell me. 
Switched to a water, and ate my meal. The meal was good besides the chicken tenders. They tasted sour almost, so I didn't eat them."}
{"text":"I have been to this location a handful of times and I have enjoyed every time. The location isn't only perfect, but the ambience is great as well.

The food is always great, I have never had a complaint here about the food. The service is always good too, the servers have always been A+ in my experience.

I would recommend this place to everyone and I'm confused why it's ratings aren't higher? If you're looking for some good food and happen to be in the area, stop by here, you'll love it!"}
{"text":"This is a heart attack waiting to happen.   Grease meat and over portions American style.   Come here often if you want a slow suicide."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch, portions were small.  Took 20 mins to check out after eating because they were understaffed."}
{"text":"Great service. I adored the trash can lid that the 3 meat platter was served on. Hilarious! 

I feel that being a chain, this place sure knows good BBQ. I'm from Texas, trust me. Since I don't have that luxury of BBQ on every corner anymore at my disposal, this place does not disappoint and is my new substitute BBQ place here in Vegas. 

The 3 meat combo had everything we wanted off the menu so we did it for two people. Brisket, Ribs and Chicken!! Brisket and the Ribs were my favorite. Juicy not over cooked. Chicken was good as well.  The sides were plenty and we subbed the coleslaw for veggies. Jalepeno mac-n-cheese was surprisingly good.  Lots of food left over actually and so worth it; for the price you can't beat it and so I strongly recommend it. 

We ordered sweet teas and they were perfect! Not too sweet and its probably a disgrace to call it sweet tea bc it was more like half and half tea.  I just relocated from South Carolina and the tea down there is sweet. I mean DIABETES sweet! I was worried it would be true southern iced tea but it wasn't. And I was glad for it! 

The only thing we didn't order was dessert. This place is quite good. Much better value and quality than Buzz BBQ. I think that Memphis has good Carolina BBQ so if you are into pulled pork, you should try them first. Famous Dave's also has Pulled Pork but Memphis has more choices for that."}
{"text":"This is a hard review!

The good:  service was fast, customer service was excellent.  Our waitress was a true gem!  

The bad:
The table was sticky and so was the menu.
I had hair in my cole slaw that wasnt mine.
The BBQ sandwich has two separate bones.

 I am willing to try again, maybe.  Just not anytime soon."}
{"text":"This visit was awesome!  Famous Dave's is a chain so you just never know what you will get!  

The manager came by and checked on us, he had a great personality! 

Food was as expected & service was prompt!  

Consumer suggestion:  ease up on the ice in your beverages.  :-)"}
{"text":"Famous Dave's lives up to their advertisement on their meats. Tastes pretty good, & the meats just fall off the bone. In addition, their sides are tasty. I recommend their jalapeño macaroni & cornbread. The place itself was built & decorated very cute! It all plays well with the theme. I wish I saw it get more busy because when I went, it was super slow. Yet the service was still nice. Make sure you go ahead & try all their interesting BBQ sauces on the table. It can enhance your BBQ greatly. Also, if your names Dave or like David, you get a deal. Aren't you guys lucky?!"}
{"text":"Yeah, it's a chain but it's still one of the best bets for barbeque in the city. Better, in my opinion, than Memphis Championship BBQ but not as good as Lucille's.The food is consistently good and you get plenty of it for the money. 1/2 slab of ribs, corn, cornbread, and two sides for $12. You'll leave satisfied. All the other menu items I've tried in the past have been solid. On Monday's kids eat for $0.99 with the purchase of a regular entree. The service at this location was a little slow last time we went, but usually they're pretty dependable."}
{"text":"The meat is great.  I love the BBQ sauce options.  The brisket is a must, the ribs are great (get them \"naked\" and put your own sauce on), and the sausage link is wonderful.  The sides are meh...the service is meh.  I like their lunch specials- just enough food.  
When you are craving meat, this place will satisfy that urge."}
{"text":"The food is amazing and CONSISTENT at this location.  
The bartender on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights is friendly and fun.
Sit at the bar and enjoy their happy hour!"}
{"text":"So let me start off by saying Debra is the sweetest ever.. She was basically almost off her shift & seen we haven't been helped yet so she took our orders right away. As for the other servers, they were nice BUT very very VERY slow, it took us 5 minutes to get seated & service was just slow.. I went around 9pm for happy hour so they weren't even busy...best thing on the happy hour menu are the nachos, it was super delicious! Very disappointed about the wings and fries basket because the wings are super tiny and they basically give you like 6 fries smh.. Usually even for happy hour the fries are suppose to be more than half way full but not over here lol I will definitely be back for the nachos & beers though!! :)"}
{"text":"so sad to hear that this location closed up. Deb our server will be greatly missed. She's the one who pretty much tells us what we decide for dinner.  Pretty cool."}
{"text":"First time here and my family loved it, our waitress (Chelsea) was great she gave us different options!! We order the BBQ platter!! It was big for all us!! My twins my husband and my self! Perfect side!! We will definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"Wow.  The Ultimate BBQ Burger was possibly the best burger I've eaten.  

Delicious sauce (liked the Sassy one and Sweet one).  The chopped pork is great, ribs are really good (although I prefer the baby backs served at the Dave's in my CA hometown), brisket is yummy, and the best chicken fingers ever.  Cornbread muffins to die for.  The beans were pretty good.  The BBQ chicken is pretty good.  I didn't care for the catfish fingers (too lemon peppery for me) or the hot link so much.  Good onion strings and pretty good bread pudding.  

My only suggestion would be for them to have better side dishes like sweet potato fries and mac & cheese.

Great service, too."}
{"text":"Food was okay.  Server charged dinner price after I pointed at the lunch menu.  I tried to point it out to her but she was adamant about the order. Oh well. I won't be going back there again."}
{"text":"It's sad when we have to admit that \"the best\" BBQ comes from a Wisconsin chain restaurant - I mean, what the heck does Wisconsin know about BBQ? 

But being \"good\" BBQ in Vegas is a dubious honor, when there is NO good BBQ to be found anywhere in Vegas.

 Still, the food is not that bad, although the service could use some serious adjustment."}
{"text":"Food is always good. I Love that they have specials alot of the time. Sometimes service is a bit slow specially when they were short staff."}
{"text":"Food was not bad . I was trying to tell  more friend about this place but customers  service was so messed up. They think because we look were not going to pay good tip so they dont put much attention to us 

First , we ordered the food and the server threw  the food to us  harshley like i felt like  she didn't  want to serve us .
Second , they were  sitting  next to guys and did not  focus on the other customers but the customers  they were sitting with they were even flirting with them
And asked them like how much they gonna tipping them . I dont care what they doing but they horrible to didn't care about different  customers . And should be and act  professional  because they make the other customers feel uncomfortable  because  they are flirting and talking about things that shouldnt ve discussed at wour even more worse if its with a customer  and theres kids around horrible customer service  not only for our waiter but there were others that would stop to chat and talk to them rather then attending  the rest of the  customers .
They act like hookers in the works please dont be like that guys . You are guys are server not  hookers . We didnt even finish our food because of how uncomfortable we felt ."}
{"text":"First time to have bbq in Las Vegas, I think. Not the best choice but it was the closest. It was just OK. If I were wasted, it probably would have tasted amazing. 

The ribs were by no means what-so-ever falling off of the bone. In fact, some effort needed to be applied to tearing it off. Sides were just okay. However, it is pretty much what I expected it to be and that is Mediocre. 

To Go service was pleasant and fast.

I'm glad I didn't spend more than $20 on this. 

I doubt I will be back."}
{"text":"Been here before and really enjoyed the food and portions were large. AND...they serve alcohol!! Great bbq place."}
{"text":"Been a fan of famous Daves since I first tried em back in 2007. So I decided to try their henderson location and their to go menu at the same time. And I'm glad I did. Order was perfect, service was outstanding and they even have bbq sauce packets of some of their more popular sauces so you can have the in restaurant experience at home. I guess it's the lil things I notice most. Great job"}
{"text":"Went there yesterday. Great service by Stephanie our waitress. Food was good. Even the manager checked in several times through out our meal."}
{"text":"Famous Dave's BBQ is a chain.....that's right a chain. They serve darn good Q. I love their sides: the creamy slaw(ummmmm), those friggin beans with bits of brisket,ribs, and links (omg). 

Dave's serves great st louis style ribs, rockin hot links, and darn good bbq chicken. I like that they have many brews on tap and that the place has raised booths. Service is efficient and nice. If you are in vegas like I am all the time....check out famous Dave's."}
{"text":"Service was great. Ordered the beef brisket and rib tips with mac and cheese and mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes were alright but the mac and cheese is a must try."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with my boys. They sat us down right away, no wait. Lunch menu is great, a lot too choose from. Drinks are good. Our server was very friendly too. Great experience."}
{"text":"Went to this location for Veteran's Day. I have been to many Famous Dave's, they've all been great, and this day was just as excellent. I'm leaving the 5-star review because my mother and I received our meals for free that day, it was wonderful and thoughtful to be honored for serving America. Please see ASHLEY B for 5-star service."}
{"text":"Love me some BBQ! Despite being a chain, they typically do pretty well at it. Seems each restaurant has a uniqueness to it, just enough to keep it fresh. 
Funny thing is, I never order the ribs here. I can make those at home. I get the brisket, links, pulled smoked pork....making me hungry as I write this.

I made the unintentional mistake of ordering the 'off the menu' BBQ sauce, Bubba's Revenge and let me tell you what, I like it spicy but this stuff was liquid fire. Great flavor but just a bit too much. I mixed it with the regular stuff to create my own version so was able to enjoy it.

Dave does it right, in my book. and I always enjoy it."}
{"text":"For a chain, it's pretty decent BBQ. There's always more food than you can eat too, so prepare for a doggie bag (does anyone call it that anymore?) The meat combos are the way to go if you want to try a variety. If you know what you like you can narrow that down to your fave. If you have an ass made of steel, try the Wilbur's Revenge sauce...you'll feel that the next day, I guarantee it. Personally I mix the Texax Pit and Sweet Zesty, nice smokey sweet kick. Give it a try and give me credit ;)"}
{"text":"Got to the restaurant and we were seated right away, getting acknowledged once we were seated is a different story. There weren't many patrons dining at the time and for the server to take way too long to greet us is unacceptable. Giving 2 stars because the food was delicious but the service warrants no stars."}
{"text":"We had a birthday party of 12 and had a wonderful meal. Our server Travis was amazing. We ordered 2 feasts and some appetizers and drinks. We had 4 kids meals which were huge portions.  Everything was delicious. We also enjoyed the staff singing Happy Birthday. There will definitely be a return visit in the near future."}
{"text":"We would always split between us a full slab of ribs which were really good with two sides. If we were starving it wasn't enough, hungry within an hour. Depends on the slab but it's a hit or miss if you get a lot of meat on the bones. The sides aren't that big compared to other bbq places we've been to. The service is excellent but the ribs at times could've been a bit meatier. Overall tasty food and very good service."}
{"text":"Me and my fiancé when this place,and it's our first time to try the famous dave's we got so disappointed  the food is so cold.its okey if the first food was cold,but the second time. Not unexcused..where so excited that what happened."}
{"text":"This is a great place for picking up to go items for my family.  We love their ribs.  We call ahead and the food is always ready with little wait."}
{"text":"This review is for Famous Dave's Take Out service, which I was impressed with.  They have reserved parking and a separate entrance for take out (somewhat standard), but the service and packaging as well as the food actually being hot and tasty when I got home is what surprised me.  I was not expecting this level of attention to detail from this chain considering the service I've had dining in the restaurant in the past.

We got the All American Feast for Two- $36.99, but it could have fed 4 easily!  It included a 1/2 rack of St. Louis Spareribs, 1/2 a Roasted Chicken, Brisket or Chopped Pork (we got the pork), Corn on the cob, Corn Bread and three sides. Everything was packaged on a Deli platter which kept everything in place without being squished or getting mushy from steam.  The sides were in Styrofoam containers on the platter.  You were also able to grab packets of sauce, hand wipes, etc. to take with you.

Everything tasted really fresh and it was still hot when we got home.  I would definitely recommend their take-out."}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday night to celebrate my brothers birthday.  They weren't very busy, so our party of 8 was seated with a few minutes.  Our server was awesome.  She was very attentive and had a good sense of humor.  We got a family meal and an appetizer sampler, which was plenty for all of us with some to take home.  We all shared a banana pudding, which is also a jumbo size that 2-4 can easily share.  Everything was good to very good.  BBQ is generally expensive, but all 8 of us stuffed ourselves for just about $100."}
{"text":"Famous Dave's is great!! When I walked in I knew I was in for a treat!! They have the best drinks there! You have yo try their In-famous Margarita ...it has moonshine in it!! Yes I said moonshine! When you go you have to try the cod fish and the brisket it is so good!! The BBQ sauces are out of this world. Service is great and the prices are not cheap but not expensive it is a great atmosphere for fun and family will definitely be back to taste some more stuff of the menu!!! Definitely recommend this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Had a waitress by the name of Rene who was SOOO rude. Tried to force us to order what she wanted ( and no not suggested ) and then got upset when we told her that's not what we wanted she proceeded to be rude the the entire night and at the end came to bring us cookies and THREW them on the table in front of each person. Never coming back again. If you don't like your job find another."}
{"text":"The food was delicious .. the service was a little slow mainly on refills of drinks. None of us got cornbread muffins which is the only reason I gave 4 stars. I love the mac n cheese with the jalapeño in it. Best Mac n cheese ever."}
{"text":"Dave's was yummy as usual. Service was quick, food was tasty, and prices are relatively low for a barbecue restaurant. Also portions are large enough to be shared. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We stop here about every time we visit Vegas.
The ribs, BBQ Chicken, Chicken tenders, pulled pork were excellent as usual."}
{"text":"Always great tasting barbecue & great size portions too! I inhaled the pulled pork. So damn good!! Had a signature drink & banana pudding for dessert! Will be back!!"}
{"text":"I am not experienced with BBQ so take that into account when you read this review.  I came here yesterday for take out.  I got two dinner combos--a Georgia chopped pork with the sides of Wilbur beans and garlic red skin mashed potatoes.  The other combo was a Texas beef brisket with sides of potato salad and Dave's cheesy mac and cheese.  Both came with a corn  bread muffin.

We enjoyed the dinner, perhaps because it was a different kind of meal for us.  It was quick.  I didn't call the order in but went there and ordered at their To Go section.  The wait was about 5 minutes.  Customer service was very good and I was soon on my way.

The only thing I regret is all the plastic used for take out.  Some recyclable, some not.  I think another time, I'd just go and eat there rather than bring home so much that will end in the landfill.

I'll be back but I need to try some of the other BBQ places in town including one recommended highly by Nelson Q.  He never steers me wrong."}
{"text":"Service was great. Food was great. Restaurant and restrooms were super clean. Food is fairly priced. Not much more I can say... Best BBQ I've ever had."}
{"text":"What the heck Famous Dave's?  Take out order was subpar.

Check out the picture of the miniature corn bread.  Bought 1/2 dozen to accompany the Feast.  Unacceptable that I was charged full price for half a muffin.  Overall, the quality of food was down tonight.

Fries were not finished cooking.  Brisket taste was off.  No BBQ sauce.  Really disappointed."}
{"text":"Not pleased with the wait, they had 11 open tables from where we could see and we were told it was a 20 minute wait?!? Finally found out it was due to them having a few larger groups, so the kitchen would be backed up, with all the empty tables shouldn't that balance out the group? Can they not handle groups? Obviously they are not use to a crowd..."}
{"text":"Great BBQ at decent prices. Especially at happy hour. Stop in the the bar and see Detroit Dave, he will take good care of you !!"}
{"text":"Second time here and phenomenal service both times! I had the brisket today and it was to die for, it literally melted in my mouth. We will definitely be back. Thank you so much to Alyssa D for the incredible service!!"}
{"text":"Let me first start by saying that I am not a BBQ fan.  However, when I visited Corky's BBQ in Memphis, TN I fell in love with BBQ.  So when a friend invited us to \"Famous Dave's BBQ\" I was hesitant but I went along.

Wow!  It was tasty!  I actually ordered the salmon but had a taste of my hubbys BBQ and I loved it.  The cole slaw? Yee-haw, down right the best I've had in loooong time.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I ate lunch here today. First time visitor. The service was very good and attentive. I had the ribs and brisket. The ribs were to die for. They warm warm the meat fell off the bone and the taste fantastic. The brisket was also very tasteful. I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Normally it is a good meal. We both ordered the 3 course option which seemed like a good value. The meat was warm but the sides we just about cold. After we thought ohh at least there is going to be dessert. The server comes by and says do you want your check. He brought us boxes and I agreed and paid. I should have said something but we walked out without being offered the 3rd course of our meal. It was a good run while it lasted Famous Dave. On to the next place..."}
{"text":"Came in around 2:30pm for a late lunch. They had great lunch specials that lasted til 4pm and the prices ranged from $7-$9.

I had to wait 25min before being seated. The hostess informed me they only had 1 server and bartender and that's why I had to wait. However, as I sat down I saw that they were not understaffed with 3 servers and 1 bartender. I don't understand why she told me different. It seemed they didn't have an efficient way to handle the tables. The few people inside looked like they were waiting for a while as well.

The food was not spectacular. I ordered a 2 meat lunch combo as well as 2 extra meats.
I had the beef brisket, St. Louis style ribs, rib tips, hot link.

The St. Louis ribs were okay 3/5. They were a little dry but edible. I appreciated how they weren't over sauced.

The hot link was not to my taste 2/5, would not get again. It was more fatty than meaty and had a heavy pepper taste, but no smoky taste that I prefer.

Rib tips were good 4/5. I really enjoyed the crisp of the skin.

The potatoe salad was interesting. 2/5. It was more of a mixture of coleslaw, potatoes and egg that was watered down. It was pretty bland and it was room temp instead of cold.

The brisket 1/5 was terribly dry. And parts were inedible.

Best part was the corn bread muffin! FREAKING DELICIOUS

I would prefer to spend a little more and go to another BBQ place like lucilles or try a mom n pop shop."}
{"text":"I was somewhat let down. I have had Famous Daves a handful of times in the past and enjoyed the food. I enjoyed it enough to sign up for their email club, and for doing so I received a buy one entree get one free coupon because my birthday is in September. My husband and I decided to use the coupon this past Wednesday evening.

A side note: Contrary to another recently posted review, Famous Daves DOES still have the weekly specials, as of mid-September of 2011. We were offered special pricing on the brisket meal due to it being 'Beef it Up Wednesday'. I was in the mood for ribs though, so I got a combo plate that included ribs and chopped pork. 

The last time I had Famous Daves, I remember trying to pick up a rib with a fork and having the meat fall off the bone, it was so tender. This time the ribs were not tender at all, I had to work to get the meat off the bone.  The chopped pork was ok. I prfer pulled pork, but that's just a personal preference. My husband enjoyed the chicken sandwich he ordered, but thought the diablo bbq sauce was weak. I still love the corn bread muffins. 

I debated making this a 2 star review because well, I HAVE had better... But at the same time, it wasn't that bad. Our server was decent, friendly enough and pretty efficient. And with the coupon, the price was great. So 3 stars, but next time I am craving ribs I will be headed to either Tony Roma's or Lucille's."}
{"text":"I love me some good BBQ. For a chain, Famous Dave's is some pretty awesome BBQ. I'd rather go here then Tony Roma's or Memphis BBQ any day.

At my work, we usually do our own thing for lunch Monday-Thursday and then go to lunch together on Fridays. This week, I got to pick where we had lunch, and I was feeling like some BBQ. So we decided to give this Famous Dave's location a shot.

I ended up splitting the 'BBQ for 2' meal with a coworker... $19.99 and got got ribs, chicken, and brisket plus french fries and two more sides of our choice, as well as 2 cornbread muffins. We got the baked beans and the fried pickles for our sides. I had never had fried pickles before trying them at Famous Daves. Wow, so good. 

When the plate of food came out I tried to grab a rib with my fork and the bone fell right off the meat, back onto the plate. I love that they have 5 different sauces on the table for us to try. I also love that I walked out completely full with a bag full of leftovers. Great food, great prices."}
{"text":"This is my first visit to this location and I'm still a fan of Famous Dave's Barbeque...=)

Service: Our server was friendly and kept the drinks fresh throughout the meal for our party of 8 on a late Saturday lunch.  Orders were taken correctly and had no issues with splitting the bill at the end of the meal.  Very competent service for a chain restaurant.

All American BBQ Feast:  Per the website: \"A full slab of St. Louis-Style Spareribs, a whole Country-Roasted Chicken,  1/2 lb. of either Texas Beef Brisket or Georgia Chopped Pork, Creamy Coleslaw, Famous Fries, Wilbur Beans, six pieces of Sweet Corn and four Corn Bread Muffins\"  We had relatives from the Philippines and we wanted to show them some food in the good ol USA that would no be common from there and the All American delivered.  The spareribs were on point and the country roasted chicken was juicy and flavorful.  I love that the Corn Bread Muffins come out hot so the butter just melts when it meats the muffins.

Ambiance: Casual dining with country influenced steelo complete with lots of wood.  Wooden floors, tables complete with checkered red and white serving paper with the All American Feast.  They keep a roll of paper towels at the table which is perfect for messy dining when eating ribs with your hands.

Famous Dave's has consistently delivered on the food and I'm glad that this location in particular came through for our guests from out of the country.  This is a go to place when BBQ dining enters the conversation.  Enjoy yourself, it's a celebration! =)"}
{"text":"If you like food that taste like it came from a hospital then enjoy your bland flavorless food. Came out warm and dry. Definitely felt disrespected that they would think it's okay to serve food at that temperature."}
{"text":"The Texas pit sauce.....try it!! 
Really great service, great food, great sauce. I think we will try to go back before we leave vegas :)"}
{"text":"My first time here was in June 29, 2017 and I'm in beyond satisfied with the food quality, the venue, parking spaces and the outstanding service of our waiter. He was very attentive of our needs and was always there to reach if we needed some thing. He was very accommodating to all of us. There 9 people on our party and we left that place almost rolling out on a wheelchair for all the food we stuffed our faces. We ordered their fiesta platter (2) of them and we were so surprised how generous that platter is. It was a great birthday celebration for us and it was the best decision for us to try that place. Famous Daves please keep up the quality and great service. Thank you for an amazing experience! We'll be back again!"}
{"text":"I am kind of over this place. The past few times we have visited this location the service is horrible. There will be 20 plus tables empty and we have to wait because they are not staffed accordingly. This is a bbq joint mind you, everything is already cooked and mostly just needs to be plated. If you can not serve patrons close your doors and go away and let another buisness come in. Safe yourself time and frustration and choose another restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place... the food is always delicious and we always have a 
to-go box left over.  The servers are always very nice, friendly and helpful.  I love the ribs and hot links.  The various sauces and very nce.....  The reason they don't get 5 stars has to do with the speed at which you can walk in, have lunch, and leave.  It is better to have about an Hour or more as it may take some time to be seated, and then place your order.   Then there is the wait time for the food, which is usually good, but then again to receive your bill, etc... it all takes time, which you may not have.  One thing they could do is seat people faster, or hand out menus when they arrive so that while waiting, they could be picking out their meals.    
I am a member of their email club.  They send out a free meal for birthdays ( with purchase of a meal).   Dave's personal life story is inspiring..... If you like hot sauce.... order the Wilbur's Revenge Sauce.  It is the Hottest BBQ sauce ever!!
Enjoy!"}
{"text":"...my family & I ate here last wk. While running our card for payment, their payment system went down, & we were told they had to \"re-boot system, \" as to reason why it took them so long to \"ring us up.\" Over the weekend I log on to our bank account & see that we have 2 charges, for the same amount, fr Famous Dave's on the same night! So they must have ran the card Before their system froze & ran it again when it came back online. Since this was over $70.00 charge, with a tip, I called the restaurant to notify them, this morning..  I spoke to \"Deb,\"...she said she was the Manager...they NEED a new Manager!!!!!! While trying to explain to her what happened,  she would not let me get a word in edge-wise...she just said, well it's your banks fault & you need to talk to them if they take it twice...Wait?! What?! Your waitress ran my card TWICE, that is why I have the two (same) charges! WHY is it my bank's fault. I was \"trying\" my best to explain to her that I would have to file a Fraud Report with my bank, that is ONLY way the bank will reverse the charge...when I know that all she could have said was, come in with the same card, when you see the second charge post, & we'll reverse the charge to that card! NO, she went on interrupting me...how in the world is this person a \"manager\"?...good managers are suppose to LISTEN to the complaint, & try to SOLVE the problem, & defuse any issue(s)...I couldn't even get a word in edge-wise!!!!! Why should I have to go to my bank, in her words, \"it's your bank's fault for letting it go through two times...& you would have to fix it with them!\" Listen, my bank wasn't the one who charged me! It say's Famous Dave's on the 2 charges! I was trying to tell her that I would allow 2-4 dys for the charges to be fixed, if I still see 2 charges fr Famous Dave's after three dys have past, then I would come in with my bank account info, on my smart phone, showing where the 2 charges have been deducted so Manager can do Reversal to the same card...I never got to finish my sentence because,once again, I was cut-off mid sentence...\"Deb\" would not listen to my complaint & would not budge on the fact that they made a mistake, sorry we ran the same card twice! ... Somehow, it was real \"easy\" to find the charge & 4 ending numbers to the card that was used...so there must have been issue...with every card/person using a charge/bebit card when their system crashed...& I was one of the few who waited this long to bring it to their attention. Long story short, I hung up on their so-called manager!...she needs SERIOUS training in Billing & Customer Care! ...if I go to my bank to \"reverse the charge\" it will take me having to file a Fraud Report & it can take up to 30 dys to get the money back! Where does \"Deb,\" live, \"under a rock?\" That she has never dealt with a bank!!!! Everyone knows that a business/restaurant, can do a reversal & it would take a few dys to credit back charge! ...my family & I WERE regulars there, to the point where even the waitress knows what drinks to bring us even before we ask, & she does...we are Not ever returning to this restaurant!!! & thank goodness for the internet & \"word of mouth,\" because I will let all my friends know to avoid this place. Or PAY IN CASH ONLY!!! Listen this so-called manager, I dealt with, was very abnoxious to the wrong person...I ran companies for a living, & I know to go to the Attorney General & the BBB, when you're dealing with \"money matters,\" & issues like these. I will be filing an Attorney General complaint against Famous Dave's if I see a second charge post in a few days, & my bank doesn't reverse it! I shouldn't have to go through the inconveniences because YOUR waitress ran our card TWICE!!!!! YOU, the manager should have listened, apologized for the inconveniences, & tried your best to resolve the issue; not argue with your customer & putting blame on their bank! That's the appropriate response! Deb needs to be sent to a Certified Management Class! Too bad employees like Deb are the reason businesses do bad, at times!"}
{"text":"3  stars. My customer wanted to come here BC it's convenient and not busy. We were seated asap just after the lunch hour began.

I just ate BBQ at their NLV location so I opted for the Cajun chicken sandwich with onion strings. The sandwich was just ok and the strings were soggy and greasy. I would definitely not order these again! The food was sub par but friendly waitress Annette really made up the slack.

I'd stick to the BBQ and avoid those nasty onion strings, If not for the friendly service I would have given only 2 stars at best."}
{"text":"The Famous Dave's Blue Diamond location is way better than this location. First - the bathrooms at this location were dirty-  Seat covers were not replenished & just plain yucky!!!   As many times as we have eaten at the Blue Diamond location the bathrooms have always been clean. 
The food just lacked the usual BBQ yumminess that we so enjoy at the other location. 
The complimentary potato chips that were given to us in a small bowl looked like the bottom of your potato chip bag - tiny broken up chips/crumbs - weird... The BF thinks they just gave us a bowl from a departing customers table cause it just didn't seem like a new bowl. We all had to change out our sweet teas cause there was nothing sweet about it - the waitress said that the person making the tea didn't brew it right, BUMMER!!!!
Now, don't get me wrong - the corn muffins were still good and our food was OK just not what we would call yummy like how we'd feel after we ate at the other Famous Dave's. So maybe all the problems are due to them just opening not too long ago, I don't know.... Maybe, we will give it another try a few months from now. Who knows, I'm not psychic!!!!"}
{"text":"Famous Dave's is always good when nothing else sounds good.  It isn't super fancy or special, but it gets the job done when you want some traditional American BBQ quick!

The menu is diverse and has a lot of American favorites on the menu from BBQ beef, pork, and chicken, burgers, fish options, and even salads.  My favorite items are the BBQ pulled pork and the catfish fingers.  YUMMY! I will almost always get one or the other almost every time I visit a Famous Dave's.  Hey, I know what I like!  They also have some great side items to add to your meal.  The spicy mac n' cheese is quite a highlight and delightful, if I do say so.

The desserts here are really pretty good as well.  My favorite new dessert is the Banana Pudding dessert.  It is really, really good!  I have to admit that it is at least as good or maybe even better than my mom's Banana Pudding.  Yummy for your tummy!
I also have to give props to Famous Dave's because they have Sweet Tea!  It is so hard to find Sweet Tea out West, so whenever I do, I am all over it like white on rice.  I love me some Sweet Tea!  Yummy!

Overall, the food here is good, the service is good, and the price is low.  If you just can't decide what you want to eat, you know you can find something good at Famous Dave's."}
{"text":"Who knew food on a trash can lid could be so good?  My family apparently because they knew exactly what to order on what would be my first visit to Famous Dave's (shocking I know).  We ordered an All-American Feast to feed the five of us and we hadleft overs.  Thats a lot of food.  There was a whole chicken, brisket, a rack of ribs, baked beans, cole slaw, corn on the cob, corn bread muffins and potato wedges.  We also ordered fried onion strings and fried pickles as appetizers.  We left so full.  

The ribs were tender and fell of the bones.  I don't like ribs and tore into these like nobody's business.  The brisket, while fatty (we were warned), was delicious and had a beautiful smoke ring. The bark on it was awesome.  I could not stop eating it.  I wash the was more on the platter even with all the other goodness going on.  The cole slaw was traditional as were the beans.  Good but traditional.  The potato wedges were a good way to try all of the six BBQ sauces Famous Dave's has to offer.  There are five on the table and the sixth (XXX) you have to ask for because it is so hot.  I didn't find it so bad but I only used it sparingly on a starchy vessel.  That seemd to cut the heat to more manageable than I've heard in stories from my dad.  The one part of the meal I was not happy with was the corn on the cob.  It was overcooked and soggy for my liking but that is pretty normal from a busy restaurant in my experience.  They can't very well cook it to order.    Aside from that, even the leftovers were bangin'.  

I will be sure to stop back by here on a few sproadic Wednesdays as they have a Wednesday night special.  I can't remember exactly what it is but there is brisket and a $10.99 price tag.  Maybe a once a month visit is not out of the realm of possibility."}
{"text":"Overall experience was all right. The waitress was excellent.  Plates are huge & every customer was leaving with left overs. Their meat tasted very smoked but their sauces were very different. One favorite was rich & saucy sauce but you got to try devils spit! Whoooooooooo"}
{"text":"We come here with my in-laws when they are in town. They love BBQ, and we know what to expect from Famous Daves. 

We always start with the Onion Strings. They are crispy, slightly greasy and really flavorful. They come with a rèmoulade sauce. Once you start eating these, it's difficult to stop. 

We each got the 2 meat lunch special. I got the BBQ chicken, and the ribs. It was 1/4 chicken with a dry rub, and two ribs. I was served the white meat chicken, while my mother-in-law was given dark meat. There was quite a bit of meat on both the chicken and the ribs. We each got a corn muffin along with the meat, and a choice of a side. I got the potato salad, which had a bit of what I am guessing was pickle relish. I am not a fan of relish, but it was just a touch and was pretty tasty. 

My MIL asked for extra butter, and was given a small cup of whipped butter. What comes with the muffins are small plastic containers of butter, so this was a nice touch. I like that there is roll of paper towels at the table...no need to ask for extra napkins...and many different BBQ sauces to choose from. If you have never been to Famous Dave's, they will describe each of the sauces for you. 
Always good service, and consistently good food."}
{"text":"I'm totally not impressed....food always too salty, getting cedar plank salmon was a big mistake, fillet itself was so small (3 oz) with two cheap side item and it's $16????? I can pay for the same price and get a much better salmon meal at CPK!  do they seriously think they can keep customer coming back by serving over priced small portion food?everything just taste so salty, fish is covered with sweet sauce, so much I could barely taste the fish, rice is way too salty, I even start to have headache afterward, service was really good though, just wish they made better food and price is more reasonable, not coming back."}
{"text":"Okay, went back a couple weeks ago, much better experience.  Food was great, service was wonderful, and atmosphere seemed different.  Ribs especially were delicious, cooked perfect.  Hope they keep it up."}
{"text":"Bad service at this store. Would not return to this place. Unfortunately the food is great so I will have to go to another location. Rakia S. Was very rude. It was my sons birthday and she did not even acknowledge him or say happy birthday. I ordered the special rib tips (from 2-6 pm). We were sat at 5:53pm and she took our order at 5:56 pm. She came back and said that she was 2min. Late for getting the special price. Did not offer an apology or compensation. I did not eat as this was going to be my meal.  Very disappointed in the customer service.from this waitress."}
{"text":"This place is a chain that I'd never heard of or been to before, so I was really excited to go check it out during a business trip in Las Vegas.  Tuesday special was a discount off \"The Big Slab\" ribs, so my manager and I shared an order.  That was a better deal than each of us getting a 4-bone dinner.  :)  

St. Louis-Style Spareribs, a corn bread muffin, with two sides (we chose fresh steamed broccoli and grilled pineapple steaks)...  we were in hog heaven.  I normally can chow down a lot but was totally stuffed and we couldn't even finish our meal.  

Since it was our first time visiting, the server brought out a basket of potato chips and explained all the different sauces on the table.  I'm not a huge BBQ person, but it was fun to try all the different flavors and notice the nuances between each kind of sauce.  

Definitely a fun place to enjoy dinner with a group, and the decor is fun and quirky.  The server was super nice, and the food was plentiful and delicious."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service. They have wonderful managers who deal with any issues. Great place if you have food allergies. The manger will come to the table and discuss each item with you. 
The servers never \"forget\" about you. The greet right away, visit and check back often. Might be the best \"family BBQ chain\" in the country."}
{"text":"The best experience I've had in a restaurant is a while. Erik is wonderful! So kind and so polite! The food tatsed good. We did find a few hairs in one of our dishes, which was a first for us. We told Erik that there was a few hairs, not expecting anything. We were going to pay for the food anyways. But the maangma made our whole meal free. This place is great"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here as a last-minute decision. I have to say that it was a good decision. I had the Cedar Plank Salmon and my boyfriend had the ribs. Our sides were: mashed potatoes, fries, steamed broccoli and coleslaw. Both meals came with cornbread. Everything was delicious. The salmon had a lot of flavor. The ribs were juicy. The rum punch that I had was also tasteful. Customer service was great. Our server was Amanda, who gave great recommendations. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"A while back we used to like Memphis BBQ until we had the BBQ at Famous Dave's. We've been to the other location at Blue Diamond several times. We came here on sunday (our 1st visit to this location) to cash in on a birthday coupon promotion- buy one entree, get one free (join the club online). We requested a booth. There is a ton of seating here (several dining rooms) and there is ample parking as well. There was a pretty good lunch crowd here; also family-friendly. This location used to be a steakhouse but the chain failed and closed up shop. 

All tables come equipped with salt, pepper, ketchup, a roll of paper towel, some menus and the five signature sauces- rich and sassy (my favorite), devil's spit (very hot), georgia mustard (vinegar based), sweet and zesty (another good one), and texas pit (tomato based). We forgot which ones we liked so we sampled them all.  

On the back of the menu, there is a set of daily early bird specials, so that's what we ordered- the two meat special that came with one side and a corn bread muffin, and we opted for an extra side for $2.29. (After our drinks came, we got a small salted and seasoned freshly made chips.) I chose the brisket and the roasted chicken while my husband got the chopped pork and brisket (said that there was some fatty pieces and that the skin made it crunchy, so he will not order this again). There was very little fat on the brisket which was a good thing (I always cut the fat off everything). Several slices with some sauce topped a single slice of soft white bread (I took a bite but didn't finish it). The chicken (breast and wing) was really good, moist, not overdone, though I didn't finish it. For my sides, I chose the mac & cheese (hint of jalapenos) and the fries (thick, skin-on, crisp). The mac & cheese was excellent. I liked the fries too, not greasy and mushy. I gave some fries to my husband. My husband got the mac & cheese and coleslaw. I took my corn muffin home to eat later. We'd been craving BBQ and this really hit the spot.

Service was really good. Both our drinks, and food came out pretty quickly. Our server came to check on us several times, and gave us refills without us asking (love that). He was also helpful when it came to the menu, we had questions on the heat of the mac & cheese (my husband can take a hint but not much).

We want to come back soon for the advertised special, the Que for Two @ $19.99- such a great value."}
{"text":"Chain BBQ place with pretty darn good BBQ.  Big portions and lots of menu options, . Brisket is really good.  Great Happy Hour in the afternoon and late night.  Nightly specials early week are good also.  Have eaten at two locations and both were good.  Contrary to another review this place is very clean and well kept.  Expect to spend around $18 per person with soft drinks plus or minus $4 depending on your order."}
{"text":"The food and the service here is terrible. My husband and I wanted to get lunch here because the prices were reasonable but the waitress basically talked us out of it. I always take leftovers home but the food was   so nasty I didn't even bother. The waitress seemed bothered if we ever asked for anything. I'm a dealer and work in the service industry and always tip at least 20 percent,  I only tipped 10 percent today. I had a groupon and was still extremely disappointed. Don't waste your time or money here! Lucilles has way better food and service if you're in the mood for barbecue."}
{"text":"Has been awhile since I had been to a famous dave's and thought we would give them a try. 
We were sat right away by a friendly hostess. Our server was super busy with her tables but still attentive and friendly. Our food arrived and was better than I had remembered. The beef brisket is still my favorite. 

The variety of BBQ sauces was fun to try. 

We will go back for sure."}
{"text":"A couple of friends of mine (you know who you are) suggested we all go here after work.  One friend of mine said it was VERY good BBQ, to which I said I've had very good BBQ and I'll believe it when I taste it.

He didn't exaggerate one bit.

The food was phenomenal!  The service was outstanding.  The manager came by to make sure we were enjoying it, and even made some well received recommendations.  

Not only would I go back again, but I can't wait to take my wife, too!"}
{"text":"I make sure to have a group of ppl with me so we can feast on a bigger meal altogether and save money. Their food is so damn good and I enjoy eating here. I also like the fact that it's not too packed so you don't have to worry about a long wait"}
{"text":"This place is completely average. Has horrible ribs. They were so dry they didnt even come off of the bone. It was basically a huge disappointment cause the place smelled amazing"}
{"text":"So-so-so good ribs and chicken.Fries very delicious I never eat before like this one fries.Thanks."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, good BBQ and friendly servers. My wife loved the BBQ Nachos."}
{"text":"Bad service, unreliable food ! Skip it

Annoying that I always get the same thing suddenly they tell me you can't get after their ridiculous happy hours is over! Lost my business"}
{"text":"I crave their wings every so often. They have a great crisp on the skin, and slathered with sauce. Yum. 
I used to just order wings for dinner (I'd get the two meat combo, with double wings) but I recently tried the ribs and they are quite good!

I love corn bread, so the muffin they give with every meal is always finished off. The crisp sweet crust is perfect.

I am not a huge fan of their sides. The green beans are from a can -yuck, the mac n cheese always kinda dry? I dunno, I just get the apples and corn.

My boyfriend got the two meat combo last night, and the portion of meat seemed much smaller than normal.  Luckily for him, I had a rib and three wings I couldn't finish for him.

I know BBQ is by nature salty, but I was parched all night and today. I even woke up in the middle of the night needing to refill my bedside water glass."}
{"text":"Food is always consistent here. Feast for one is definitely enough for two if you're not starving! 
Ribs: meaty & not caked with tons of sauce. Add a side of two for $3.99
Draft beer: $5.50 reg price 
Spool of paper towels for your messy hands. Needed with the wipes! 

Food is always hot, fresh & yummy here!
Great quick 4th of July meal without all the mess in your own kitchen! 

Aaron was a nice & good server!!"}
{"text":"I ordered take out from here and got the All American BBQ platter. It came with beef brisket, ribs, chicken, fries, beans, cornbread, corn on the cob and mashed potatoes. The ribs were the best meat, the beans were salty because there was too much bacon in it. The cornbread was delicious and it was like a muffin. I also ordered the chicken ceaser salad, and the ceaser dressing and croutons were really good. The fries were soso. The chicken and wild rice soup was not what i was expecting because it came creamy."}
{"text":"I've never been dissatisfied with the food. It's always delicious. Previously, I had a bad experience with the service, but Tino, the GM took good care of me and my family. We went back last night and Renee was an incredible waitress. I will definitely be asking for her the next time we go. 
Thank you Tino for your hospitality!"}
{"text":"hard to find in Vegas, is good BBQ, and Daves hits the spot, try the chili next time, awesomeness"}
{"text":"I'm not entirely sure why I keep returning to Famous Dave's. Is it the ease of the establishment? The name brand? I don't know. Their BBQ is not the best, nor is it the worst, but I am certain I could find better BBQ, even in Vegas, if I tried a little harder. I guess I'm just lazy.

I came here with my mom, niece, and a friend for dinner. The place was busy, and it was the middle of the week. Our waitress was nice and brought our food out quickly. 

My friend got a rack of ribs, my niece got hot wings, I got the rib tips, and my mother got the brisket. We all ended up ordering broccoli for a side and I got their mac n cheese. I have to admit, their mac n cheese is really good. It has jalapeno chopped up in it. As for my meat, I was, as usual, somewhat disappointed. Most of it was too hard to even bite off. What the hecks? Why doesn't it just fall right off? I get it, it's the tips, so they're kind of like burnt ends... but I DID NOT order burnt ends! They don't even serve those.. I don't think so anyway.

My mom said her brisket was good and my friend said the ribs were pretty good too.

I just think there's better BBQ to be had elsewhere. Some mom and pop shop somewhere in this big city is waiting for me to find their delicious BBQ...."}
{"text":"Pulled pork is very tender and tasty and the cornbread melts in your mouth. Portions are huge so go with an appetite! always order to go so I'm not sure the dining experience, a little pricy too."}
{"text":"This Famous Dave's is better than others that I normally eat at. Our waiter Eric (or Rick) was the best. Eric made our dining experience (4 star food /5 star service)  We will definitely return."}
{"text":"This is ABSOLUTELY the WORST Famous Dave's in town. Save your money and go to the one over on N. Rainbow; it's only about a 10 minute longer drive if you take the Summerlin Pkwy to the 95 N.  The staff over there is MUCH friendlier and infinitely more attentive.. the employees at the W. Flamingo location are beyond apathetic AT BEST.  

Expect to not have a single drink refill throughout your entire dining experience, oh and make sure you're well hydrated upon entry because it'll take them AT LEAST 15 minutes to get you your drinks in the first place, and that's only IF you're lucky enough to get acknowledged by your waiter/waitress within the first 20 minutes that you're there. 

I've been going here for YEARS now, and literally the past THREE times the service has been the worst of ANY restaurant I've EVER been to.. in a row!

1st time: I had a couple of friends in town from California and they wanted to go somewhere good for lunch.  I suggested Famous Dave's and little did I know that it would be the beginning of the end.  Not ONE drink refill throughout the entire dining experience.  We ended up ordering one of the share able plates and when the waitress could FINALLY be bothered to bring around our paycheck.. she charged us for the one that was more expensive!  My friend being the kind and non-confrontational person that she is, ended up paying the bill while forbidding any of us to make a fuss.

2nd time:  Came here with my girlfriend.  We were sat at a booth and waited for almost TWENTY MINUTES before ANYONE came over to take our drink orders or even acknowledge our presence after initially being sat.  FINALLY the waitress came over and took our drink orders; she wasn't apologetic at all.  We MADE SURE to order our meal along with our drinks since it was unknown if we would see our apathetic waitress again.  Our food came out, and since my girlfriend and I were parched we finished our drinks rather quickly.  There was a party of four sitting directly next to us; our waitress came and checked on them and proceeded to ignore us.  After we had finished our meal without any drink refills, we then sat around and waited for the bill for another FIFTEEN MINUTES before we finally decided to speak to a manager.  After explaining the absolutely terrible service, we then see our waitress approaching us with our two drinks, HAH!  Where was she 24 minutes ago?  It seemed as though she saw us speaking to the manager and ran back to the refill station as quick as she could.  The manager gave us a discount, and I wrote it off as a fluke despite the first incident.

3rd and final time:  We decided to go out to dinner yesterday after not having been to this Famous Dave's for a year (we were still traumatized from our last horrible experience here).  Upon walking in, the hostess/host was nowhere to be found, so we stood around waiting to be seated. We were seen by multiple staff members, and not a SINGLE person acknowledged us.  A family that had just finished eating their meal, whom had seen how long we had been waiting to be sat literally approached us and told us not to eat here.  Apparently their food was so terrible (they said it came out cold) that they had to send it back, AND they had terrible service on top of that.

I will NEVER go to this Famous Dave's location again.  I'm pretty sure anybody leaving good reviews are either friends/family of the staff, or the staff members themselves.

Save yourself the money and go to the one on N. Rainbow by the Best in the West shopping center.  You WILL thank me because while the staff at this location may be absolutely god awful, Famous Dave's food is still delicious at their other locations! :)"}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ.. And I'm from Texas! I had the \"jacked and stacked\" brisket burger, absolutely delicious. Very flavorful on hot buttery bread. The coleslaw on the side was hands down the best I've ever had. I'll always make a trip here every time I come to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"We love Famous Dave's. All around best BBQ on our side of town. We usually dine but this time we ordered to-go for my mom's birthday dinner, we were able to feed 8 people plus leftovers for $100..not bad. Food is always good and the to-go staff was so nice, the woman working at the counter even noticed my military I.d. In my wallet and offered a discount. Great experience all around"}
{"text":"Had dinner with the family here tonight for the first time. I have to say it was pretty good and for all the food you get the price was reasonable. I had the platter for one. Came with a variety of meats and 3 sides and bread. Boyfriend had the St. Louis ribs platter and he enjoyed them. Ribs weren't really to meaty but for the price it was fine."}
{"text":"Lunch menu is a great value for the money. We still brought leftovers home. The kids meals rocked."}
{"text":"Just back from lunch . First time at Famous Dave's . I'm not a bar b q person but thought we would give it a try. Was it great!,, service was top of the line to match the food! Will be back for more! The ribs melt in your mouth,a must try"}
{"text":"The food was not good. The ribs were dry and the meat did not fall off the bone. I was not impressed at all. The servers were friendly, it didn't make up for the food."}
{"text":"Today was ok i think my waitress was new...food was good service couldve been better"}
{"text":"Well,  for a week I was Googling BBQ ribs, while waiting to finally get paid so I can come here and pig out for the first time.  So when I finally got there--- it was on.  

I walked in, and *BAM* 20 trophies in my face from having the best BBQ.  Okay, a good reassurance.  The hostess and server was quick, friendly, attentive, and efficient.  I got to sample the different bottles of BBQ sauce with their homemade potato chips.  Loved the \"Rich & Sassy\" and the \"Texas\" sauce.  I ordered a sweet tea, and shared an order of the XXL Ribs (a slab of 12 ribs) with the mister.  For the sides, we picked cole slaw, mac n cheese, potato salad and it came with a cornbread muffin.  Mm--mmm...fall-off-the-bone, savory, and sweet.  We ordered the Famous Dave's bread pudding at the end of our meal.  (Not your average, sloppy bread pudding you see in the dessert section at a buffet).  

Overall,  it was a fulfilling experience.  Great service, tasty food.  I recommend it.  

**BTW,  if your name is DAVE,  you get an entree for free on August 14 for Dave's Day."}
{"text":"I am updating my previous review.  The manager of this restaurant contacted me by phone and has since apologized for their \"mistake\" regarding the Veteran's meal.  He informed me that they re-opened the special menu again that day after similar situations with other veterans.  The manager has also sent me a hand written letter apologizing again and included a gift of a free meal.  
Thank you for stepping up and fixing the problem."}
{"text":"Seated us in a booth that had very little space between table and abdomen on both sides. Food was served within 5 minutes of ordering, so I imagine large vats of items kept warm on steam tables. My chopped pork was dry; wasn't attracted by the sauce labeled \"Devil's Spit.\" Yech. Service was attentive"}
{"text":"Always try to come here when we visit Vegas. There's no real bbq places in Hawaii.  Glad my brother and sister in law introduced us to this place. Had the St Louis rib combo w/roast chicken. Very good, first time having the roast chicken. Moist and tasty."}
{"text":"I ordered the shrimp and meat combo, which gives you two skewers of BBQ shrimp, a choice of meat, two sides, and corn on the cob.  I chose rib tips for my meat and mashed potatoes and beans for my two sides.  Everything was good except for the rib tips, which is a major part of the meal.  I found them to be mostly tough and overcooked.

I've had Famous Dave's before at the North Rainbow location and I remember enjoying it, so I'm hoping this was just a one off thing.  As it is, I can only give this place three stars.  Perhaps another meat type would be more enjoyable."}
{"text":"Okay the service was very good.  Grant G is very nice.
Decorations are okay, the place is cute.
The food was soooo disapointing!    The corn muffin crumbled into hundreds of crumbs.  The broccoli was beyond salty.  The stuffed potato with pulled chicken was luke warm.  Nothing about it was hot.
Go to Lucille's at the Red Rock Casino if you want a good lunch special with a barbeque stuffed potato.  Not only is it good and served warm-it is bigger.  After seeing all the awards this place has received I am puzzled."}
{"text":"They have great deal on lunch special menu! BBQ Ribs are great as always. Their rib tips, brisket & grilled pineapple are awesome too!"}
{"text":"Famous Dave's likes to forget to bring you your corn muffin (happened 3 times). I would have given 5 stars but the corn muffin is the best part so I hate waiting for them to go get one once they realize the mistake."}
{"text":"Saturday night when everyone is out shopping for Christmas in this restaurant is located inside of mall ring Circle in Henderson Nevada. Ironic every table is empty but they said it's a 20-minute wait because the servers can't handle the amount of volume. Nice."}
{"text":"Knowing this restaurant is a chain you would think there food would continue to be great since it already has its name out there. I was wrong. The food was disgusting. Mac & cheese was more like soup, the sauce wasn't even that cheesey. Potato salad was bland bland bland, except the huge chunk of onion you might bite into. The brisket was so fatty it was gross. I know you can't always choose how much fat comes on the meat and I hate fat but even cutting off all of it from the portion I got only equaled out to about 2 slices of brisket. Can't forget about the starter salad which had brown lettuce all up in it. If you want GOOD BBQ, go to Lucielles over at Red Rock. Best BBQ hands down."}
{"text":"Family wanted to go out for dinner as a group, there were 15 of us. That's a lot of people.  We called ahead and they had a table to accommodate our needs. 
As a group, we ordered 2 family platters that came with 3 meats each, 2 large sides and cornbread.  Even with 15 people,  there was still a lot of left over food on the platters to bring home. 
The ribs were amazing, fall off the bone delish! 
The pulled pork was amazing, adding the Texas Pittsburgh bbq sauce to it was awesome! 
The bbq..Holy yumminess!!
I didn't try the sides but heard they were good. We had Mac and cheese, mashes potatoes,  Cole slaw and baked beans.
Oh and the cornbread was pretty amazing too!!
 If you are in the area craving bbq, go here!!"}
{"text":"Famous Dave's reinforces the thought that chains suck. I had such a bad experience back in April 2011 when this location opened that I didn't go back for awhile. 14 months later I finally decided to give them another try and place a carry out order. 

The person who took my order over the phone was nice and helpful. Apparently there is a special website: famousdaveslv.com that has the local menu on it which differs somewhat from the national menu. After taking a look at it we settled on mac & cheese from the kids menu with a side of spiced apples, Texas Beef Brisket with spicy mac & cheese and cole slaw, and a BBQ Chicken Sandwich with a side of Wilbur Beans. $29 got us three little black plastic boxes and a styrofoam cup of milk for the kids meal. 

So when we get it home we open the bag up and we're looking at $30 worth of food and we're like where's it at? Appearances / non-standard portion sizes aside, it didn't taste much better and all the Rich & Sassy sauce you can smother it with didn't help. The brisket was over cooked and tasted like double corrugated cardboard. The spicy apples looked like someone dumped a big spoonful of spice on top and it looked bad and tasted like crap. The BBQ chicken? Awful! Bleech! Boring, flat, I thought this was BBQ? It sure doesn't taste like any BBQ I know! And being from Kansas City, one of the 4 established American capitals of BBQ I know BBQ. 

I could go on and on but the fact is the dog ate well last night with half the brisket going to him, my 2 year old ended up spitting out the mac and cheese and the apples, and pretty much everything else ended up being put in a nice 30 gal plastic trash bag for Republic Services to take it where it belongs. The landfill. It was so bad I found myself thinking Sysco's horrible \"BBQ\" meat - just add their special food service sauce\" would have tasted better than this slop. 

I promised my wife that for as long as we live in Vegas, I will never ask her to have Famous Dave's again. Ugh, why did I torture my family by thinking this would be any good? They deserve better, and so do you. Don't go here.

Edit: After finishing writing this review I looked over at the dog bowl and the brisket is still there. He even moved it out of the way to get to the dog food under it. Seeing that I created a new list: Even the Dog won't eat it. And my dog likes almost everything so this is kinda weird when he won't touch it."}
{"text":"For some reason this place is losing its touch..."}
{"text":"I ordered a huge feast lol anyway chicken was alright, BBQ ribs were bomb, brisket was meh lol. I may just go back for the BBQ ribs and slaw that's about it."}
{"text":"Not so Famous Dave's, came here to eat because I pass by this restaurant a lot and looked like some where I would like to try. Big mistake, walked in and the hostess was telling everyone that it would be \"just a few minutes\" to be seated when in fact it was more like 15 minutes wait  for a table. When we were seated the male host that sat us told us our server would be back with our menus, which I found it odd to be seated without menus. Waited another 15 minutes before we were acknowledged by a server. The bartender walked by whom was very friendly and asked if we have been helped and if we had menus. When we told her no, he brought us menus and offered to get us started with drinks. When we ordered two beers  on draft, which mine tasted like some kind of soap in the cup and the other beer was flat. When our server Diamond showed up we told her about the issues with our drinks and she corrected them quickly. However when our order was taken it was very wrong. We ordered the Pulled chicken nachos which we got brisket nachos, I ordered a pulled pork sandwich with cheese and the cheese looked like it was bitten and was actually just a slice of sand which cheese and the pulled pork was just that, pulled pork on a bun with a piece of bitten sand which cheese. My husband ordered the select your own two and it was very dry pieces of meat. Manager came by our table and just said hi but went to all the other tables and had full conversations with them. Not sure if a racist thing because we were brown but food was not good and service was ok I guess.. the bartender was great!! That bartender needs to find another job somewhere else cause she's wasting her talent at a place that runs this way. The managers should go through a Real training because this place lacks customer service. If this was my brand I would be very upset that my hard work is hiring people that allow places to operate like this. So long story short, I don't recommend this place. You can make this stuff at home!"}
{"text":"This place has one of the best BBQs, Denise was a great servant, the food was great, portion was enough, not too much and not little, just enough."}
{"text":"Long review ahead... This was an incredibly poor quality visit.

I was so disappointed with this place when we took my husband for his birthday. We were expecting a large group of people for the celebrations, so, being a courteous diner, I called them to notify them at 1pm that we'd be showing up with a large group at 7pm, so they could be prepared. (We were expecting 18 at the time, and we know that can be hard to accommodate...) The girl seemed disinterested in taking any information, and said she would know who we were and be prepared. 

I became wary about two hours later, so I called and spoke to some rude man who kept interrupting me with \"We don't do reservations.\" I'm sorry, but when it's a large party, you TAKE A FUCKING RESERVATION so that you don't end up with a ton of annoyed people cluttering up your lobby area while waiting for you to be prepared for something that was called in hours before.

Since it was too late at that time to change plans, we showed up. We had to wait 20+ minutes to be seated, had to ask numerous times for serving plates for our appetizers, etc... We also told them at the beginning of ordering how we would be splitting the checks up, and we were very specific about it. The server/bartender said he understood and would make sure it was taken care of. 

Service was slow as shit, the drinks were extremely weak, and when one of our guests asked what items did not have MSG (she's allergic to it) the bartender took over 30 minutes to tell her that... he didn't know. (Upon calling corporate, I found out that they have allergen menus for people with all sorts of allergies...)
The only thing he was sure about was that the macaroni and cheese side dish did not contain it. (He gave her a tiny side dish of it for free, but didn't offer her a larger portion, so she had about three bites to eat for dinner... she decided to go to McDonalds after, so she could actually have food.)

When it came time to split the check, the bartender fucked it up. He charged one of our guests who was just paying for his girlfriend and himself, the amount for most of the group... roughly 15x what he was expecting to pay. This fuck up brought the guest 15 cents away from overdraft. It took over 30 minutes to get them to correct their mistake, and the bartender said after the screw up \"Well I didn't think you guys were going to tip anyway...\" (For the record, he got a 20% tip, even though the staff really didn't deserve any...)

Called their corporate office and explained this fiasco to their customer relations department. Was promised a callback the next day, haven't heard from them at all. It's been 3 weeks. No attempt to rectify the situation or retain us as customers. 

Thanks, but I'll go to Memphis or somewhere that actually gives a shit about their customers next time... screw you guys at Famous Dave's.

TL;DR version - Rude/neglectful service, improper billing on people's credit cards, uninterested corporate complaints department... Not going back."}
{"text":"The services was outstanding the food was delicious. We enjoyed our Father Day dinner. Not sure why rated low because our experience was amazing."}
{"text":"Saturday night in December. Stopped by this Henderson location since we were in the area. Started out with the sampler appatizer. As soon as the server brought the stack of sampler plates, we got suspicious when 3 out of the 4 plates had unwashed BBQ sauce left on them. We cleaned two plates ourselves and asked for one replacement,  but the replacement had unwashed BBQ sauce on it too. Getting nervous about this location. When the sampler appatizer came,  the black plastic service tongs were sticky. Held them up to the light and sure enough, clearly not washed at all. They had BBQ finger prints all over them.  

That was the last straw. The manager came by about then and I told him that his location is too dirty to trust and that we couldn't eat there. I suggested he needs to do alot cleaning and employee training and we walked out.

Luckily,  there's a Miller's Ale House right up the street and an Outback across from that."}
{"text":"Max took my take out order for work. 4 separate orders. He was so friendly ans helpful! I  will be goi5back because of him! Thanks Max!"}
{"text":"Love it!  I went to Famous Dave's last night and they did NOT disappoint.  Although my order was \"to go\", the service was excellent.  I ordered the St. Louis Rib 'n Meat Combo and the Fried Catfish entree.  Everything was very well-seasoned and delicious.  Everything was exactly as I ordered and it came out ready to go in a very short amount of time.  Next time I will order it to eat there, but it's just as good for takeaway.  So what if it's a chain?  As long as the food and the service is great, I'll keep going back!"}
{"text":"We went today and ordered 4 lunch specials.  All of the food was very tasty.  Even more so than the other locations.  I find this interesting as I would think it's the same recipe and preparation.  The only complaint I have is that most of the food was warm vs hot.  I mean like sitting around for a while warm.  Still tasted good though.  If it were just food, it would have been 3 stars.  Our server, John, was awesome.  Attentive, helpful, patient, and spot on.  For that we added another star."}
{"text":"We were here on Saturday and the food was good but the service was pretty bad. We began by ordering a water and an iced tea. The woman who waited in us brought 2 iced teas. So as not to cause her more work even though she made the mistake, I told her I would keep the erroneously delivered iced tea. (Not in those words- I just said \" oh it's ok I'll drink this.) We received no refills of said ice tea and when the food came, my husbands sides were wrong. He told her he ordered pineapple, not corn so she goes back to the kitchen and gets the pineapple but when she sets it down she says \"That's a good way to get a third side.\" I was surprised since SHE made the error- not my husband. Throughout our interactions she seemed like she was on drugs. Completely strange. At the end of our meal, ironically, she delivered my water. When the bill came, we were charged for her errors!The food was good- the waitress was spacey!"}
{"text":"Ridiculous. Came in at about 4:10 the place had maybe a total of 10 other costumers in there took about 10 minutes to be seated fine , but than proceeded to wait 15 minutes without menus tried waving someone down was ignored , after 20 minutes I have had enough I'm walking out and never coming back , a shame was really looking forward to trying the bread pudding."}
{"text":"You know its good bbq when your bone falls to you're plate and you just keep eating without notice.  The food is always cooked to perfection here, except the corn lol which is ok, they do meat so well it doesn't matter if they screw up on the veggies.  I know some restaurant chains start to get complacent with the service the longer they are open for, not saying this place will,  but its new location, if you visit now you're going to get the best they have to offer"}
{"text":"We had \"Famous Tad\" and he was a great server! He got our drinks quickly and we were never dry. Before our meals came out Tad went over the different BBQ sauces which was nice. Our lunch came out quickly and was delicious as always. The lunch special is the way to go! Our family of 5 ate and had sodas/tea for under $50."}
{"text":"Recently I went to my local famous Dave's for barbecue with a buddy of mine. It was so yummy and the service was great. 

The waitress Jasmine had great recommendations which I'm sure wasn't difficult considering everything on the menu was delicious. Regardless she was as sweet as honey barbecue sauce so sweet I asked to speak with the manager just to complement her. When the manager came out to meet me he was extremely nice as well. 

Before leaving Jasmine brought me out a gift. She gifted me with a to-go box with six free muffins to take home. I couldn't believe. I had a muffin each day for almost a week and I cannot wait to go back to Famous Dave's for more"}
{"text":"We have been here on a number of occasions and have not been disappointed once. We always get the burnt end for an appetizer and the feast for 2 for our meal. The waitresses are always extremely nice and seem happy to be serving us. When ever we want good BBQ we never go anywhere else but here."}
{"text":"Oversized portions. Enough for lunch tomorrow. They do barbecue the way it's supposed to be done, with a rub, not sauce. The sides aren't the same old same-old. Grilled pineapple is top notch.

This location has great service (thank you Renee). Ended a tough week on a good note.

Tip: desserts are way too much for one person. Share!"}
{"text":"This is a relatively new place so maybe they are still working out the kinks. 
My 1st visit here was on Easter Sunday right after church. The service was awesome. . also right after opening so the staff is on their best behavior w/ i'm sure lots of mgmt watching.  I was complimented several times on the way to the table and our drinks were filled and food was great!
ENTREES: I ordered the manhandler (brisket and a smidge of sausage on top) The bf ordered the brisket plate. Both were great. 
SIDES: I went w/ the beans OMG so good. Bf went w/ mac n cheese.. good but nowhere near as good as blue's bbq was that closed down on the other side of the galleria. . (for not paying rent from what I hear)

2nd VISIT: nowhere near as good. It was like night and day from our 1st visit and left a lot to be desiered. . . 

We arrived around 745.. not too late. we ordered the que for 2. perfect for us.
RIBS: the ribs were eh. the 1st piece was good but as you moved further in to the rib the worse they got and harder and not falling off the bone, by the last rib they were just plain tough. 
BRISKET: it was ok. not as good as 1st visit
CHICKEN: pretty good. didnt have it the 1st time so we had nothing to compare it to.  it was good but I was too full to have more than a bite. 

Beans were great again. . how can u mess up beans? 

SERVICE: omg. . WOW. the girl never refilled our drinks not even once. my bf was tempted to go fill his own glass. i dared him to but he never did. i gave him the rest of my tea. so then I was thirsty. the girl disappeared on us after 20 minutes of us being done we had to ask another waitress nearby if she could bring our ck b/c we just wanted to get out of there. 

the girl showed up long enough to bring the ck. w/e - not sure if i'll go bk. this left a bad taste in my mouth. We are from TX and this place is nowhere near as good as TX bbq but its as close as we can get in this area. . but my love works too hard for his $ to spend it at a place that cant give us consistent food. . 

the bf had to ask for a plate not once but 2x.. . as well as paper towels b/c our booth had none. finally the waitress brought his plate out and gave us papertowels from another booth. we couldve donethat... It was just an all around bad experience. ah well you live & learn, right? 

note: the ribs @ the rainbow location were just like this too. . good on 1 side and tough on the other end. . .not good. . just plain not good."}
{"text":"I wasn't too extremely impressed with this place but I needed to take my dad somewhere other than Lucille's.  I love Lucille's but he has to go there every time he comes to town, and he comes to town quite often.  There really wasn't anything memorable about my visit other than the waitress being just as annoying as my dad.  Not really her fault though because he was egging her on.  The food was fine.  The service was fine.  There was nothing special.  Even the Pecan Pie was just okay.  At the end of the day, I will probably stick with Lucille's unless someone tells me of a better BBQ place."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I work here.. so you can either take this review as being biased or kinda like an insider view on it.

I've worked at Applebees & Buzz BBQ.. so I know how a restaurant works. I can tell if something is iffy. 

I just wanna state that this place is OBSESSED with food quality. It's pretty insane, actually. They throw away anything that's not used within two hours. I was really heart broken by this.. just thinking about those delicious little yellow corn muffins not fulfilling their destiny as something yummy in someone's tummy really saddened me. 

Everything here is pretty good. If you haven't tried the Texas Manhandler sandwich (hot link & brisket) I recommend that you do. They come served up with these hell-fire pickles that makes any sandwich mouth-watering. (I made spam sandwich one day and ate it with some leftover pickles I had.. I ate about six of the sandwiches just because the pickles made them taste so good). The bread pudding is amazing. I don't even like bread pudding, but the one we have here got me craving for it ever since I first had it. Craved it so much that I couldn't wait til the next time I went to work, so I decided to try another place's bread pudding to satisfy myself. I took three bites but it was a no go. So i ended up getting one of ours that same night after my shift lol.

Anyway, I just wanted to write this review because on Father's Day, I heard one of my coworker's tables complain to her about how the ribs aren't fresh and how they come out so fast because we make them ahead of time.

Pretty much all the meats here are smoked, then thrown on the grill when its ordered. If you didn't know that.. you should have read the menu more. The smoking part is done ahead of time, of course, but nothing is really ready to serve until it is ordered. Everything the cooks do is in small enough batches that would be used up in an hour or two.. since like I said, we throw them out after the 2nd hour.

This place seriously serves up quality food. It's pretty impressive, especially because it is a chain restaurant. With over 3 years of restaurant experience, I've seen some questionable things done. Never once have I seen anything off putting here."}
{"text":"One of the best rib joints in town. Service was excellent. Ribs were perfect. The brisket was a little over done and dry today.possiblely because we were there late and they were starting to close. Normally the brisket is delightful.  I asked for unsalted fries and that is what I got.Been there too many times as my waist line can testify too. Corn bread is the best. Highly recommend Famous Dave's."}
{"text":"We've been here before and we always ask for the Que for Two. It used to be on the menu and it is still available if you ask. It's plenty of food for my wife, daughter and myself and we still have food to go. To start off I love the chips that are served and the seasoning is great. Also I love the Arnold Palmer (Half tea and half lemonade). There is also a good variety of sauces to choose from. There's nothing much more I can say about this place other than the food is very good and prefer this place to Lucille's located at the district."}
{"text":"I usually don't review chains this large (or chains in general) unless I have a specific reason to do so.  Chains are just that, chains.  They are typically the same everywhere.  But, I do have a reason to review Famous Dave's, and it's not a good one.  I used to work near Famous Dave's and we ate here often, if not once a week, definitely once every 2 weeks for lunch.  My favorite was the Cajun chicken sandwich.  A Cajun spiced chicken breast with spicy remoulade on a soft but firm bun with fried onions, cheese, and veggies.  It was fantastic.

Well, I don't work near here anymore, but the wife and I were out the other day and decided to hit up Famous Dave's for nostalgia purposes.  We were seated immediately and drink orders taken promptly.  So far so good.  I ordered my usual sandwich.  When it arrived, the bun was different.  Vastly different.  It was sort of like a weak ciabatta, but crumbly.  It fell apart almost immediately after I started eating.  No integrity whatsoever.  The chicken was not seasoned, it was just a grilled piece of chicken on the bun.  And, it was left on the grill too long in spots, so those great char grilled marks turned into burned spots on the chicken that gave you a bitter flavor.  There were several of them.  The onions and sauce were the same, which I expected.  But, the devil's in the details, and the failure to season the chicken was a substantial failure.  Even with the sauce I liked and fried onions (always a good addition to anything) the sandwich couldn't be saved.

We will probably return and give it another shot.  I did enjoy many lunches there in the past, but I hadn't been in over a year.  So, I'm worried this is how things are done now at this location.  But, like I said, I'll give it another chance."}
{"text":"The restaurant was overall good in service brisket was good, loaded potato was good, BUT DO NOT ORDER FAMOUS DAVES MAC AND FUCKIN CHEESE IT HAD MF CORN IN IT ! I just wanna know who tf puts corn in the Mac and cheese oh i know. WYPIPO! I almost choked on my whole life, i should've just choked and said i was dying to get a check but i was so shook bruh, this was so disrespectful to my MOUTH, TASTE BUDS AIN NO WHAT IT JUST TOOK. I'm just so flabbergasted bruh. I'm in shock. My tongue immediately rejected and ejected that shit out my mouth. just saying y'all stay safe."}
{"text":"The restaurant is empty and there's no staff. We waited 10 mins before we even saw a host. Then he asked if we could \"wait 15 minutes because we're short staffed and a server just went on break\". So we said ok,can we at least be seated while we wait? \"No\", he said, \"there's no tables\". The place is empty mind you! So I said \"there's a table right there!\" The kid says \"yeah but I'd have to get it ready.\" Needless to say we left."}
{"text":"Good food but excellent service. KOJO met my expectation as a phenomenal server and went above and beyond. He gave us a great menu tour and offered great selections along with with cooking techniques.

I did not feel like he was up selling me at all but instead describing very well and let us decide how we wanted to dine.

We went with the feast for one (1/4 roast chicken, spare ribs, and brisket) with corn on the cob, baked beans, Mac and cheese, corn muffins, and french fries. We also ordered the \"famous hour special\" (same as happy hour) barbecue spare ribs tips. 

KOJO started off by dropping off some homemade barbecue chips and proceeded to go through all of Famous Dave's signature sauces. From the sweetest to the most spiciest. I enjoy all of their sauces and ended up mixing their spiciest (habanero blend) with their sweetest for a nice balance. The chips were very crispy and well seasoned. KOJO also dropped a lot of knowledge and ingredients of each sauce... Creating an interactive experience.

Next our barbecue spare ribs tip dropped off. It was a very nice portion that came with fries for $6.99! I love how tender those pieces of meat where and kept dipping away in heavenly sauces.

Then bam! Our feast for one was dropped off. What a huge plate! Definitely shareable between two hungry people! The roasted chicken was crispy and juicy. No dryness to detect. The brisket was tender and served on top of a garlic toast. The baked beans were very sweet (a lil too much for me) and my guest loved the Mac and cheese (which had a nice jalapeño kick to it). The corn muffin was moist (not the best I've ever had) and the corn on the cob was alright. My only disappointment was the spare ribs were a bit on the drier side, not something I'd expect since the spare ribs tips and chicken were so moist.

After everything, KOJO suggested we take a survey to earn a free dessert which he was happy to pack to-go as we were too full to eat more. The banana pudding was delightful. 

Although we did have very few hiccups in food quality, I'd say the service has earned the 1 star from a 3 to a 4. Had we not receive wonderful service from KOJO, my rating would be a 3 star. I'd even go as far as a 4.5 because of KOJO.

I'll give it another shot in the near future!"}
{"text":"Service was good. I just didn't care for the ribs and this is why I went there. The ribs were fatty and lacked flavor. They reminded me of $5 rib packs I can buy at fresh and easy to heat up in the microwave. The drinks were tasty and they have good happy hour."}
{"text":"I had the unfortunate experience of eating at Famous Dave's last night. 
The bad experience started right at the front door. There were 2 young hostesses to greet us. We were told there would be a 10 minute wait. We were able to see into the dining room and saw at least 20 empty tables! We waited about 15 minutes to get seated, having to endure the two hostesses talking about Christmas shopping, gifts, etc.  
after being seated our server came right over to take our drinks order. She brought them right over, only bringing one straw for two drinks! I ordered the burnt ends sandwich with corn on the cob. The food was brought out quick enough but we still had only one straw and no eating utensils!
My burnt ends were so tough and fatty I couldn't chew them. The server came over to see if everything was alright. I said \"no\" and she replied \"oh, ok\" and walked away. I are the frozen corn on the cob. When she brought our check, she noticed I hadn't eaten the meat and asked me if I wanted a doggie bag. I told her the meat was terrible and she replied \"oh, i'm sorry. That's a shame\"
We paid the bill and left, knowing we'd never be back again."}
{"text":"After being sick, I was ready to get back in the carnivorous festivities.  Earlier that day, I passed the Famous Dave's and thought, \"I'm going to try it tonight.\"  This location is super close to my house and super convenient.  I love BBQ so this is a match made in BBQ heaven.  

This restaurant is in Mall Ring circle right off of Sunset Ave.  I decided to take out for the sake of my sickness.  I called in to place my order and Kelsie was my hostess. It was a very awkward greeting. She literally said \"thank you for calling famous Dave's how can I help you- oh my goodness!\" I asked her if she was alright and she didn't answer me, so I just ordered.  The restaurant is a warm comforting place, similar to other BBQ restaurants.  The thing about BBQ restaurants is that you feel like you're on someone's porch. There's lots of knock knack decorations all over the place. There's a separate area for the to-go orders.  By that door, there's a help yourself bucket full of moist towelettes, BBQ sauce packed and plastic utensils. Very convenient.  The takeout  area is spacious and allows for a bunch of people which I fully appreciate!

For dinner, I got the Rib and Burnt End plate for $18.49.  You get a 1/3 portion of St. Louis ribs, a heaping serving of burnt ends served on Texas toast.  The two sides I chose was the corn on a cob and potato salad.  This plate also came with a corn bread muffin, pickled onions and pickle chips.  The St. Louis ribs were a little more marbleized than the baby back ribs that I'm used to.  It was just seasoned, not mopped with BBQ sauce.  The burnt ends were a little too salty for me.  Brisket ends, charred up with BBQ sauce and more seasoning.  The corn bread muffin was literally my saving grace to the saltiness of the burnt ends.  It was perfectly baked.  I thought the potato salad was too much with the onion flavor, could have gone a little less with that.  The corn was also perfectly prepared.  Two small cuts of cobs great side!

Overall, I've tasted better BBQ, however, this place is still good.  It's conveniently located and prepares food very quickly.  I'll certainly be back for the ribs, you better your bottom dollar!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome from the food to employees. We dine in on Sundays n I order takeout during the week. They never disappoint us. My kids Love their ribs. Their desserts are also delicious. This place has become one of my faves!"}
{"text":"I'm normally not a big bbq fan and I'm not a big meat eater but on a rare occasion I've had a good bbq brisket sandwich or pulled pork.  I looked at their website and the prices seemed good and I loved the side dishes so I figured I'd give this place a try today for lunch, and WOW I'm glad I did :-)  I thought this place was gonna have a walk up counter to order from and then sit down wherever you want, like any other fast casual place.  But I walked in and to my surprise it's a regular full service restaurant with a host, and wait staff.   The host pointed out today's special and when the server came over, she was pleasant but that was really about it. She wasn't rude or anything at all, but I mentioned I needed a little time to look over the menu because it was my first time here and that would be kind of a hint to her to suggest something really good or maybe tell me about the 5 bottles of sauces on my table.  I ordered the brisket basket with the mac n cheese and the baked beans. All I can say is yum yum yum.  My food wasn't drenched in bbq sauce (which is perfect for me.  I don't mind some sauce, just not a ton) The cornbread muffin was great, so was the juicy corn cob. I loved the 2 sides I picked. The mac n cheese had a little spicyness to it and the beans were flavorful.  The brisket was very tender and I even tried the mustard sauce they had on the table and that was the perfect complement to the meat.  I would DEFINITELY come back again. 

The only small drawback was, when I was finished I waited almost 5-7 minutes for my server to come by and bring me my check. She was no where to be seen anywhere in the dining room. I saw 4 other servers constantly walking around and taking care of their guests, but my server was M.I.A. As a restaurant manager I technically hold the other servers accountable as well because no one else came by to check on me.  

I always talk to my service team about always look around the dining room and help any guest in need and provide table attentiveness. This did not happen here.  But the food was great and I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"AWESOME food, atmosphere and server.  Our server TashaLee was the BEST.  She knew about everything on the menu and made suggestions when we didn't know exactly what we wanted.  Gave personal recommendations and honest opinions. The food was MORE than enough and very well prepared.  The whole decor of the place makes you feel at home and extremely well fed.   The happy hour appetizers are very well priced and the drinks look delicious."}
{"text":"***YELP 100 CHALLENGE 24/100***

We have been to Famous Dave's several times and I've always enjoyed their food. It's far from being the best BBQ but certainly not the worst either. Our last visit prior to yesterdays lunch was last September. My husband swears their burnt end appetizer is half the portion size they were before. Honestly, I don't remember but it certainly wasn't up to par to the $8.99 price tag. We usually order their BBQ feast that comes with a little bit of everything: Ribs, Brisket, Chicken, fries, coleslaw, corn, beans, and corn bread. It's plenty of food for 3 people to share. Normally I really enjoy the ribs and brisket but this past visit the brisket was really dry and unappetizing. The flavor was there but it sorely lacked the moisture and juices. The ribs and everything else were good though so I enjoyed that. The banana pudding is huge and definitely satiates."}
{"text":"I've never had a worse experience in my life at ANY public establishment.  Last night, my husband and I decided to treat ourselves and go out.  We walked into a crowded lobby and there was no receptionist.  We tried to see if there was even anyone available, wondering if we should just leave.  The place wasn't even that busy.  Finally, after five minutes, someone walks up to the reception podium.  No smile.  No \"Welcome to Famous Dave's\".  She picked up a marker and looked down at her board.  \"Name\".  My husband gave his name and she said that it'd be a few minutes and walked off again.  I told my husband that we should just go, that if this was in indication of the service, then it wasn't worth it.  But we'd been there many times before and he was willing to overlook the cold welcome to still have a nice evening.

So we get seated by the same angsty girl and she then proceeds to tell us how she's a \"bus girl and shouldn't even be doing this and she was sorry for the wait to be seated and that it was the family in front of us to blame because they wanted a booth and not a table-how ridiculous could they be right\".  There were over fifteen booths or tables empty and cleaned.  I didn't see what her problem was or why she was giving me some excuse for her poor service.  Neither of us saw her even grin the entire dinner, let alone offer any hospitality.  Then came the wait.  We ordered an order of burnt ends, a slab of ribs, and a burger.  The burnt ends came out in a reasonable time.  But we had to wait an additional 45 minutes.  When we asked why it was taking so long, our waitress replied that it was because they were waiting for the burger to cook. Are you kidding me?!  45 minutes to cook one burger!

When we finally got the food, we had a few bites and decided to take the rest home.  Our evening was a bust, the staff was cleaning up and gossiping with each other, and we had been there for too long.  Our bill was just over $55 and so we paid with $100.  The waitress took the bill, opened it on the way to her computer, and exclaimed that she hoped she'd have change and made change at the other table.  She returned the changed and slipped off to clean and talk with the rest of the staff.  I opened it to find the last straw on the camel's back to be broken.  She'd given me all the bills, but not the change.  I guess she decided that she'd just keep that for a tip or decided with her infinite judgement that it wasn't important enough to give me what was owed.

My friends and family were disgusted to hear about my experience and won't be returning there either.  We can make our own barbecue and have much better service from each other than Famous Dave's even knows how to provide."}
{"text":"When we first moved to Vegas a couple of years ago, Famous Dave's was our favorite BBQ place.  It's still okay - we love the BBQ sauce and corn muffins - but we like Lucille's much better.  The meat is more tender there, and you can tell it was cooked with love.  I find FD's to be more...generic.  It's close to our house, so we still visit once in a while, but it's nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Good BBQ chicken and ribs!  Fall off the bone for both and very moist and tender.  The BBQ sauces are very good, my favorites include devil's spit and texas pit.

One thing that is different in this location is that they have a lunch card that you will have a free lunch after 5 visits.  This place is not that busy anymore, was packed when it first opened."}
{"text":"We love to go here the food is great, and you can't beat the lunch deals. Our waitress Denise hadn't saw us in a while, but still remembered our names , which made us feel nice I had the Sweet Water Catfish, and St.Louis Spare Ribs, & Mac & Cheese. My husband had the chopped pork. Simply great!"}
{"text":"First time to a real barbeque restaurant.  Wonderful experience.  Friendly and attentive staff.  We liked the sample sauces explained and provided.  I had the brisket, my wife had the sampler.  Both were excellent."}
{"text":"Our waitress, Denise, was very unfriendly.  She came by our table multiple times wanting to take our order. While we were ordering, my wife decided to change her order. Denise seemed agitated that she was changing her order.  When our order came it was missing several things. Side orders, and not one butter on anyones plate. So we had to flag her down several times to get the rest of our stuff. We had to flag her down to get refills and then she brought the wrong drink refills and we had to flag her down again to get the right ones.  The food was great as usual. But our server was not friendly at all. Very snippy and short with us. She brought the check minutes after our food arrived. What???? Who brings you the check immediately???  We wanted the receipt (our copy) that had the information on it to fill out the survey and she kept it.  What? We asked her for it when we were leaving an she practically ignored us. We had to ask another associate to get the manager. (We were afraid to ask Denise for the Manager as we didnt want anymore backlash).  Finally as we were by the front door leaving the manager came out. The manager told us she wished she would have known sooner and she couldve remedied the situation. She finally got us the receipt with survey information and expressed she didnt like to get negative feedback via these surveys. At this point it was too late.  We will continue to eat there and hope we dont get the same waitress. I would recommend this location just make sure you get a good server.  Thanks for reading."}
{"text":"Understaffed =No service :( 
I had a hankering for some rib tips this past week and was very happy when a \"Q for 2\" advertisement appeared in my email on Thursday. I had to call in 2x because I was on hold the first time for a really long time and I was at work taking a break and couldn't really wait that long. I waited a few minutes and called back. The girl who answered the phone didn't like that I had called back but I told her I was on break at work and couldn't hold that long. She put me on hold again and then came back to the line in a few minutes. I called in my order about 4:30 pm for pickup at 6:30. I had not seen in the advertisement that this was a different \"Q for 2\" type of special... When I ordered my usual and my husband's order the girl got a lil testy and stated that the special was for 2 types of meat, not 2 different plates, like I had ordered before. No worries, I rolled with it and even ordered an extra side of rib tips to enjoy the next day. The girl on the phone got kinda short with me but I figured she was busy and advised her I would be there at 6:15 or 6:30.  When I came in to get my food at 6:15 that day, there were 2 people ahead of me and I noticed that right after I got there there were about 4-6 people behind me. The girl behind being the counter was \"Fabulous Jennifer\" and she knew exactly what I had ordered and rang up my order. I told her sorry about the mix up on the phone, I was expecting the usual \"Q for 2\" special... Etc... she picked up the phone and started talking to another customer, ignoring me. I walked over to the side wall and stood waiting... and I waited. And waited. And waited. And waited. Pretty soon it was obvious that the people ahead of me AND behind me were getting their food before me. I had stood waiting for 35 minutes when I saw a young man named \"Fabulous Thomas\" and asked if he could check on my food. \"Fabulous Jennifer\" had slinked off to the kitchen some minutes before, leaving a whole line of people waiting. She eventually came back with bags and bags of food ... But not my food. (I never saw \"Fabulous Thomas\" again)  I thought for sure my ordeal might be over soon because surely my food would be one of those bags, but no... She gave away bag after bag of food, hardly looking over at me where I still stood in the corner. The lobby was all cleared, not a customer in sight ...They had all walked in, ordered their food, waited 5-10 minutes, reviewed their order with her, and then left... With their food. (When I say reviewed their order I mean that she opened the cartons and showed them that what they had ordered was in the carton.) I asked her \"what about me\" she looked at me, sighed and said \"I'll go check.\" Some 10 minutes later she comes back and says, \"yours will be ready in a lil bit\" and answered the phone. By this time I'm thinking of getting a refund and going somewhere else. So she gets off the phone and I say..\"so, what's the problem? What happened to my order?\" And she's like \"oh, there was just a mix up in the kitchen.. Yours will be out soon...\" And I said \" How long is soon?\" And she wrinkles her face and says \"about 5 minutes\" And so I very calmly and politely asked if I could please speak with the manager. \"Fabulous Jennifer\" said \"Certainly\" and went back to a room of the side of the kitchen. After another 5-7 minutes, she comes out with a bag of food, drops it on the counter and picks up the phone, totally ignoring the fact that she's supposed to show me my order, like she did with everyone else... So, I say to her, \"oh. So you're NOT going to show me my food? Ok then\" and I opened the bag and started looking at my food myself. Her jaw dropped and she quickly put the person on the phone on hold and tried to show me the rest of the food, because she knew her manager was coming out. 
The manager came out with a big smile and warm greeting, not unlike the nurses in a children's hospital..\"how are YOU today?\" I said \"not great.\" The manager said \"I heard that you're not great- I apologize, we've been very short staffed in the kitchen, and look at me! I'm wearing a red apron too, so that means I've been working the front line, cooking along with the staff\" I nodded and said that I just wanted to tell her that I had ordered my food at 4:30, and got there at 6:15, and EVERY SINGLE person before AND after me has been served. I said I just had one question, \"Is there any point to my ordering 2 hours before pickup if I have to wait THIS long for food, or should I just drop by in person and wait?\" The manager said \"oh no, it's usually always better to call in ahead of time, it's just today is really busy, we have a special going on, you know, and we are short staffed..\" I said \"uh huh, ok thanks\" and turned to leave. As I'm heading out the door, the manager yells to me, \" have a FABULOUS day!\" I'm like yah, I'm for sure gonna YELP this visit!....Not sure if we'll be back...Tucky's on Boulder might be my new favorite..."}
{"text":"About as lackluster as BBQ gets. There is nothing at Famous Dave's beyond mediocre. And the service is curt at best, flat out rude at worst. 

The food is about 1 step above TGIFridays or Applebees when it comes to BBQ. If you're looking for something more authentic and tasty, I'd recommend checking out Lucille's BBQ. Significantly better food, and far, far better service."}
{"text":"First time coming to this place and it happened to be in Las Vegas but it was what everyone wanted. Got their lunch pulled bbq chicken sandwich which was nothing special. It came with a side. I got Mac and cheese but it was cold. Switched to the fries which they allowed but they were fresh/scolding hot. The corn bread is worth a try for $1.25. The waitress today was not having a good day. She came off very slow and rude to all parties at the table.  Will not return to famous Dave's"}
{"text":"It took me awhile to drive out here because it's so far from Green Valley. Although I'm not a huge BBQ fan, I prefer either Memphis or Lucille's to this place. 

Started the meal off with an Abita Purple Haze. I was so psyched they had it on draft - until it arrived. It was bright orange and nothing like an Abita Purple Haze. Suck. Had to send it back. 

BBQ was good, not great. Loved their variety of sauces. I was very happy they had a slider set called the BBQ Buddies. You get to try a mini version of all their sandwiches (hot link, chicken, pulled pork, brisket). Awesome way to try a sampling of their menu. Chicken was eh, but the other sandwiches were all good. 

Overall not a bad place to go for some BBQ, but make the drive to Henderson for Lucille's next time instead - it's better."}
{"text":"Bleh. The food here was terrible. If I'm going to get BBQ, it's definitely not going to be here. I always knew the food here was mediocre & thats why I never went, but I came for a dinner I was invited too and my meal couldnt have been worse. I got a brisket salad which was cold and plain. The service was ok."}
{"text":"Tashalee is awesome. Thank you. And the feast for two was awesome. Probably enough for four people if you order extra corn bread. Because I'm not giving mine up. LOL."}
{"text":"disappointing. brisket was dry. mac and cheese was cold. to be honest, little pricey for the amount of food you get"}
{"text":"The place is empty - there's at the very least 4 tables of 4+seats open, clean and ready - and several booths. But at the check in counter, the hostess is giving everyone a 30min wait because - and I quote : \"I'm the only person cleaning and preparing tables - sorry!!\".
We asked to speak to a manager who said \"I don't know what to tell ya, I'm busy taking care of the kitchen\". 

In the meantime, we've seen three parties of 5+ leave because of the wait.  This is a Thursday evening , there shouldn't be such long wait. 

This place is losing business because they need to either hire my staff or retrain their staff to be more efficient.  

Once I'm served the food, I will update the review , but it doesn't look too promising, since we've been finally seated and after 5 minutes I still haven't seen a waitress... 
Unbelievably bad service, and even worse management. Whoever owns this place, needs to come and see why they're losing money"}
{"text":"The pork platter was good. I'm from Alabama, so it's hard to please me. The sides of corn on the cob and mashed potatoes were excellent. The selection of barbecue sauces could have been better."}
{"text":"Wow, what a disappointment. How hard is it to make at least average BBQ? Apparently really hard for this joint. Ribs were tough as shoe leather, Mac and cheese Luke warm, burnt ends rubbery oh potato chips and muffin OK. Service, lack luster and slow even though there were almost as many workers as patrons. Atmosphere, dead. Oh, and so overpriced, what a waste of $20 ...went back with un- eaten meal. Manager said she would not refund but sure happy to have her plastic bowl back. Place empty at lunch hour... You don't have to wonder why."}
{"text":"The brisket was really fatty, and the rib tips were so salty that they were inedible.  Service was also bad.  How many times should you have to ask for silverware?  My first visit, and I will never go back."}
{"text":"Terrible service! The server cleared our table once the whole entire meal. She wasn't really friendly. A meal that should have taken 50 minutes on a not busy night took us almost 90. We waited 25 minutes for her to pick up our check. It then took her 10 minutes to bring it back. She was horrible. All of the other servers just looked at us as they walked by. 

The food was decent but not great. Onion strings in the appetizer is no good. It was basically battered soggy onions. I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"BBQ is BBQ- This is a chain and that is what you get. It is always good and never have to wait for a seat. Great place to go with  family and the servers are all awesome!"}
{"text":"Everything was going good.... until i bit on my corn bread & saw a hair in it! Gross! And the worst part is That I was almost done with my meal...  and when I told the waitress there was a hair in my corn bread she asked if I wanted another one!? Lmao like really? No I do not want another one! Lol 
They should really make the people in the kitchen wear hair nets or something because this was gross!"}
{"text":"We often crave BBQ and this is one of our favorite places for it.  Each time we come in, the food is excellent.  My husband loves their ribs and the meat just falls off the bone.  

I love the sausage and enjoy getting the fire cracker green beans.  They recently added some new sides like mac and cheese, the dinner salads look good.  We usually eat too much and end up bring some home, one thing good about that, the left overs is just as good!"}
{"text":"BBQ . . . mmmmm mmmmm . . . good.  A little (a lot) off the strip, but pretty much worth the drive. 

The food was fantastic. Got the family meal (enough for 2/3 people) and we had to convince ourselves that we didn't NEED to finish it all.  We had:  beef brisket, BBQ pork ribs, chicken, jalapeño mac and cheese, corn bread (very good), dirty rice and corn.  I didn't care for the corn, but everything else was very good. 

Our server made my experience great.  She was attentive, upbeat, knowledgable and, above all, friendly.  And, to top it off, the manager came by, thanked me and gave me a bottle of sauce with a $10 gift card. 

Awesome experience!"}
{"text":"I went here for my dad's birthday because he LOVES BBQ. Full disclosure: we lived in the BBQ capital Kansas City for a few years, so I expect a lot from BBQ. Anyway, since it's new, it was packed, however, we only had to wait ten minutes for a table. The service was great. And the seating area was very roomy. We ordered the onion strings as an appetizer and they were amazing! The sauce that went with it was perfect!
We ordered the georgia pork, rib tips, and the texas beef brisket. The pork was very tender and delicious, although I think anything would taste good in their BBQ sauce. The rib tips weren't what we expected. They were very hard and did not have much meat on them. The brisket was just OK. It wasn't anything to write home about. 
Overall this place is a good place to go for BBQ in Henderson, however if you want real BBQ, you'll have to go to the midwest."}
{"text":"The food here is really good, but the service is quite minimalistic. There were long periods of time when all of the wait staff was either in the restroom or in the kitchen. From where I was sitting, I could see them getting drinks- for themselves... We had to ask repeatedly for someone to bring us the check. It wasn't crowded either. Luckily, as I said before, the food is really good. Maybe get carry out?"}
{"text":"Very good BBQ! I usually get a slab of ribs with one of their excellent cocktails. Try the shiners punch! Its got a real kick and will get you happy quick. They have six different sauces so there are plenty of options to go with the diverse menu filled with a multitude of delicious BBQ entrees. The wait is a little bit, they are usually busy which you'll understand why after you try the food. They also have to go, which I always use if I have a party at the house. Excellent choice if you need a BBQ fix."}
{"text":"I've eaten here about 20 times in the last 2 years. Cheap lunch specials and good happy hour. Every table has a happy hour menu, so if you come at the right time you can get domestic draft beers for $1.99. I've tried a lot of different menu items and usually stick to pulled pork sandwiches, barbeque chicken and the happy hour nachos for $4.99... which is a barbeque-style nachos topped with baked beans and pulled chicken! Yum!"}
{"text":"Many sauces. Combo platter feeds more than a small family with leftovers to spare. Riblets are a must."}
{"text":"Very yummy food and very nice folks who work there, they honor my email coupons and  answer all of my crazy questions ( like where can I get the onions they pickle with the rib ends?) not sure but they took my email to let me know when they are on store shelves!"}
{"text":"I've been to 2 Famous Dave's restaurants and the food never disappoints! I will say one thing, the restaurant was very dark... Kind of creepy."}
{"text":"I'm trying to eat less meat but the boyfriend loves meat and he wanted barbecue so we decided on Famous Dave's since we both have never been.

We came around 9:30 PM on a Sunday night, 30 minutes before they were closing. We were gonna come earlier but The Walking Dead was on and it didn't end til 9 PM. 

Our waitress was Stephanie and I thought she was great! She was very friendly and bubbly! The manager even said hi and welcomed us as he walked by.

Even though I'm trying to eat less meat, I still ordered the Texas Beef Brisket w/mac and cheese, and fries (can't go to a BBQ place and not eat meat).  My boyfriend ordered the combo with the ribs and brisket w/mac and cheese, and fries. The brisket was tender and full of flavor. I didn't try any of the bf's ribs but he said it was good even though it was not \"fall off the bone ribs\". I liked the mac and cheese as it had bits of jalapeno in it to give it a little kick, however my bf didn't care too much for it. We both liked the fries, it wasn't greasy.

I noticed that the host seated a huge party of 10 or 12 people about 5 minutes before closing time, and I thought that was really cool of them. I'm not sure how many restaurants out there will still seat a huge party right before closing time. 

I only ate half my meal so I got a to-go box but ended up leaving it on the table when we left. I remembered when we were already in the car and were about to leave the parking lot. My boyfriend tried going back in but they had already locked the doors so he ended up calling the restaurant. The manager answered and he was nice enough to bring the to-go box out to my bf who was waiting outside."}
{"text":"Excellent old school BBQ.And a wide variety of different sauces.excellent sides.mack n cheese my favorite."}
{"text":"a southern style BBq in our own backyard.  fresh, and great smiling service."}
{"text":"I go here often on my lunch break. service is great! Food is great! my lunch is only 1 hour. They are always fast with bringing out the food."}
{"text":"I allow myself to go out for a meal once a week and that usually means my family wants to join me.  And that is O.K. with me.... every once in a while.  And, with that said... tonight we went to Famous Daves BBQ near the Galleria Mall.  

 - We went early (5 pm.)  I came in with my folks and aunt so of course they want to eat early.  It seems that as soon as you hit a certain age your clock changes or something.  But, I'll deal with it.  So needless to say, we were seated right away and our drink orders were taken.  Rachel was our server for the night and she was on top of it!!!  Brought us out chips and to make sure we were good.

 - And, no kidding... Less than 10 minutes later our food came out.  I have never had problems with the food here.  It has always been plentiful and comes out hot.  I couldn't eat my fries for the first 5 minutes of our meal.  No complaints though.  I had the ribs and wing platter.  

Side note:  Maybe this is just me... I love ribs and BBQ sauce but I always feel weird eating ribs in public.  I feel like a slob because I know that sooner or later it's going to get all over me.  Anyhow, back to my review.

 - The rest of my family were very happy with their meals as well.  I got a \"to go box\" partly because I was getting full and the other was the slob like feeling I was having.  My aunt then said let's do dessert.  So, Rachel brought out a dessert menu and I said to my family... \"Let's share a couple of desserts\"  They weren't having any of it because they wanted their own.  Even though we all ended up having the Hot Fudge Sundae.  They came out and they were huge.  We ended up leaving a lot of it on the table.  I reminded them that we should have split them.  I think Rachel thought it was funny as well as she chuckled a couple of times at us sitting in front of these huge desserts.  I felt like a total glutton...

 -  For 4 meals with dessert, soda's and a couple of glasses of wine... the bill came out to 108 bucks / 130 after tip.  It was a good meal but I only gave it 4 stars because of the gluttonous feeling I felt tonight..."}
{"text":"People love to hate on the chains.  I remember an old school yelper used to say that a BBQ restaurant automatically sucks if all the chairs match in there.  Funny but not true.

I got the facebook coupon they were offering in the beginning of July and the ribs were great.  I think a lot of people automatically prejudge because its a chain.  Everyone would be loving this if these ribs were served on a garbage can top in someone's backyard."}
{"text":"I've read some reviews about the bad service before I went there tonight. All I wanna say is the service that we've received was GREAT! And food was so delicious! P.s. if u have dogs at home, bring them some bones, rinse the sauce. they will love it!"}
{"text":"Service was a bit slow, but she was nice.  However, ribs were: dry, old, and impossible to bite through. Our server said she would tell the manager.  She still ran our card for payment and we left without anyone coming to see us."}
{"text":"Just finished up our big meal from Dave's and it was really great. Took it to-go. We got the BBQ nachos (which is an appetizer and they're huge and affordable), burnt ends app, two meat combo and loaded baked potato. Everything was awesome. Well cooked, wasn't cold, prepared very well. Highly recommended. Famous Dave's is a great spot for great BBQ."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 entrees and an appetizer.  Before we know it the entrees get served and no appetizer is in sight.  When we brought it to the servers attention, she said she would go check on it and bring it asap.  I explained to her that typically appetizers are for PRIOR to receiving your dinner not during.  I ordered the pulled pork sandwich w/ broccoli side, my husband ordered the pulled pork meal.  The pork was very dry, and the broccoli wasn't prepared properly at all.  There was no seasoning nor butter on it, just plain warm broccoli.  The service was acceptable, but the food could have been better.  Most likely will try the Memphis BBQ place next time we decide to get BBQ.  Disappointing!"}
{"text":"I have been here once before and it was ok.  Today went out with friend and he said we should give it another chance.  

We stood by hottest station for almost 10 minutes.  Had I contact from several servers but that was about it.

When we were finally sat we asked for table in dining room and we were taken to bar.

I ordered the chicken tenders.  BIG mistake.  I figure tenders would be fresh but nope they are frozen and since so skinny they aren't cooked right parts were ok and other hard.  Mac & cheese was good last time but this time it was plain.

Bout only part of mean that was good was the corn bread muffin.  Oh and the potato soup was amazing.

But service and rest of food left something to be desired. And I think I can safely say I won't be back."}
{"text":"Denise needs a personality check.  She is in the wrong business to be working wth public.  Came in first time today and the hostess was
Super nice and very clean facility

The food was pretty good too.  The Mac n cheese was pretty amazing. We came in at lunch and we got two meats, corn bread and Mac n cheese for $9. 

It's Monday and if you are military you get 20% off and 99¢ kids meal.  

The manager did come by and check on us. He was friendly and nice."}
{"text":"Famous Dave's is one of those restaurants that pull you in by the smell of bbq goodness. This particular restaurant has excellent service but the food is a little bit of a let down. The waitstaff are always attentive and helpful here, even when the place is hopping.

The food though is a little lacking. The smoked bbq chicken is good, but rubbery. The ribs have almost no meat, save some serious slabs of fat, and the corn on the cob is too small. However, the brisket is pretty good. They have several sauces, which are all relatively sweet (except the Georgia sauce - which I love), so I hope you have your sweet tooth ready. 

Service - 5 stars
Food - 3 stars

I'll give them the benefit of the doubt at 4."}
{"text":"Perhaps this area is plagued with poor service restaurants since we didn't have very much luck at the Red Robin near by. We met my parents here, who were already seated. I laughed as we approached the table since it was a both that would only accommodate 4 at best. My mother answered my laugh, reiterated they told the hostess it was a party of 5 and this is the option they were given. Not acceptable! There were only a handful of people in the restaurant since we were here for a late lunch/early dinner and plenty of other options to choose from. A nearby waiter looked perplexed as to why were given this particular seating option as well and provided us another both that would easy accommodate up to 6 people. The service after this wasn't much better either. We waited extremely long periods of time to get drinks, then food order, etc., again..there wasn't an overload of people here dining. My dad explained to the waitress that he could not eat anything spicy but wanted to try the Mac n cheese. She offered the macaroni and cheese without the jalapeños as an option. Can you guess what came with his meal when we finally received it...mmhmmm. When we let her know, she seemed surprised that we were asking for the mac n cheese without the jalapeños, like she had never suggested it in the first place..just weird. No bread was offered to the tables prior to the meal, which is usually a staple. My meal was good in flavor, not as spicy as I would have thought, being the Cajun catfish with a sweet dipping sauce with jalapeños. The portion size was also decent for the price. Overall disappointed in the time we spent here and the service."}
{"text":"This place is okay if you just want some barbecue is a chain restaurant so sometimes it's good sometimes it's not it depends on which one you go to!!"}
{"text":"I got the que for 2 and the amount of food you get is enough for 1 but not for 2. The food was lukewarm temperature wise. Also had the beef brisket as a third item that tasted blah. I saw that they have a happy hour from 9 to close chicken wings and fries for 5 and bbq tips for 7. Might go back and try that otherwise probably not."}
{"text":"I don't know why people like this place everything taste the same. Everything has barbecue sauce on it making everything taste the same. And cold . Expensive on top of that ."}
{"text":"This location is seriously lacking in comparison to others (the Blue Diamond location mainly).  My boyfriend and I went here last night at 8 for dinner and it was dead.  I didn't mind too much at first because I thought we were going to be constantly checked up on because of the lack of parties there, but boy was I wrong.  We got placed in the back on the restaurant and it took the waiter 25 minutes to even realize that we were there and take our drink orders!!! Wth?! Also many other staff members walked right by us not asking if we were okay because I kept looking around for service.  Finally a girl that was cleaning saw us and grabbed the server right anyway. Ugh.  We were waiting for a party so we decided to just order drinks to start.  We sat there for a good while not being checked up on, with no sauces on our table, or even asked if we wanted appetizers while we waited.  I was livid.  When the waiter finally did come back, we decided to just order before he disappeared again.  Also while we were sitting there were at least 6 staff members (the hostess included) just standing around chit-chatting in the empty area.  I noticed that the hostess was annoyed to be called to the front when patrons arrived.

When we did get our food, it was tasty as usual.  The service and professionalism was just lacking for a restaurant that was soooo empty.  We waited most of the night for any decent service and this is unacceptable because obviously the waiters/waitresses had nothing to do because they were able to be standing in the back area RIGHT BY US chit-chatting.

I must say Dave's, you either need better management at this location or to get rid of the slackers who get mad when they have to do their job (the hostess)."}
{"text":"My husband and I both love the restaurant.  We always get Juan as our waiter and he is fab.  I wish they had more tables though can be tough to get into.  You get lots for your money and it definitely tastes like BBQ should!"}
{"text":"Sunday, June 29, I called in a take-out. A BBQ Chicken meal and an order of Ribs. Well, the chicken was sooo tiny that it hardly fed one. Plus it was very dry. The Ribs were not much better and the two orders were 40.00. Oh my, what has happened to Famous Dave's? I used to really like their food?Well, not any more?"}
{"text":"My most recent experience was awful. I have been there twice in total. The first time was about 6 months prior, and that time is was OK. Decent food and service. Nothing special. 

However, last night it was a train wreck. I  ordered my food which was 2 meats with 2 sides. Country chicken and wings with sides being Mac and cheese and mashed potatoes. We also ordered their onion strings as an appetizer and a cpl of cocktails. 

The onion strings took 40 minutes to get, and when she finally brought them the waitress told me they were out of the country chicken. What? You're telling me this just now? It's been 45 minutes... But I was nice about it because I never blame the waitress for the problem, it's 99% of the time the management. I changed my order to some rib tips instead of the country chicken and we waited for the food. 

When we finally get the food, i receive the wings AND the country chicken... so apparently they did have it after all. Weird. She then tells me they are out of mashed potatoes which was one of my sides. Really? Again, just telling me this now? So I say just bring me another Mac and cheese then. Both Mac and cheeses were barely warm, and actually more on the cold side. 

She comes back with rib tips and says it's courtesy of the chef... so there's the rib tips I switched too... what the hell is going on here? 

We ate the food, paid the bill and left. Never going back there again. The waitress was really nice and sweet though. I didn't blame her. The management of this location must just have no idea how to run a restaurant. Either that or the cooks are clueless as well."}
{"text":"Food: The rib tips were tender and flavorful. The breading on the catfish was tasty. The cornbread was sweet and moist. The lunch portions were perfect.

Service: Friendly, attentive

Ambience: Good for families

You really can't ask for much more from a BBQ restaurant."}
{"text":"ALWAYS great food! We've eaten here so many times and they've never disappointed. I seem to always gravitate towards the rib tips and again this time the tips were cooked to perfection and leaves you hanging for more!!! Can't wait for my next Famous Daves dinner"}
{"text":"Wow ~ I have heard so much about this place and yet with this hype I leave upset with my Husband and Son spending a lot of money and still be hungry when we left!!
When we arrived it was just me and my husband. We told the hostess our son would be coming, She sat us at a table with the menu's , No one ever came over to see if we wanted anything while we waited for our son to show up.
My husband wanted to order a drink while we waited and nothing.
Then after our son showed up our server comes over and we said we were really hungry, Mind you my husband and son are over 6' tall and have big appetites. She says to order the family meal for 4. We figured that had to be enough for all 3 of us. Well my son was very hungry and he could have ate this all by himself. I didn't even get much to eat but I wanted him to enjoy himself because we were there for a early birthday dinner.
Needless to say we all wondered if we should order more food but we decided that after getting this and spending so much on it we told the server that this was definitely not worth the money for the amount of food we got. He had nothing to say except we have a lot of people get that.
I am serious it was a joke. A chain restaurant with so much hype that it was not a place I would go for BBQ again! 
I have to say Ellis Island has the best BBQ don't waste your money here!  This location is pretty far for anyone not living here.
We would not go back here and do not recommend it ~ We have had MUCH better and much better BBQ sauce."}
{"text":"Decent BBQ food. I love the rib here. Catfish is pretty salty. 
I've been to a few Famous Dave in a few states, same quality of food everywhere.
I would go back and forth between this and Lucille's."}
{"text":"The place was pretty much empty on a Thursday night at 830pm which struck me as kind of weird.  It had a certain sticky feel to it.  The service was fine.

The ribs were very good.  The spicy mac and cheese side was awesome, and both the coleslaw and the potato salad were very good.  The hot link was a bit large and a bit coarsely ground for my taste.  The portions were, in general, ridiculous.  The selection of sauces was great and I loved the Devil's Spit sauce.

Overall, I'd say solid and I'd come again for the ribs, the sauce, and potato salad."}
{"text":"Frequent visitor here. Always get the ribs and split them with my girlfriend and it's plenty of food, will actually have some leftovers as well. Once in awhile the fries will be cold but they fix it and bring me fresh ones right away. Service good for the most part though sometimes you have to hunt them down for a refill or your check but nothing too bad. Not the best bbq I have ever had but good enough to eat a few times a month."}
{"text":"Mmmmm yummy, my hubby Chris loves taking me here to get our fix of American barbecue in all of its glory! 

No matter what we order it is always consistently good every single time as well as the great service!

We took advantage of there BBQ for two limited time promotion which included an appetizer two entrees and dessert!

The food here is very good, tasty, cooked well, generous with a lot of variety as well!

We are never let down when we come here to eat.

We like their selection of BBQ sauces on the table as well as their spicy sweet pickles!

The bread pudding is delicious as well as the brisket or pulled pork nachos!

I am spoiled by my husband and Mr. Famous Dave himself! Thank you! :)"}
{"text":"Food is good. Service is probably the worst we have had in a long while. 
Besides the long time to get food, our drinks were empty for at least 15 minutes each time, our male server was condescending, and did not smile once. I felt like leaving the place in a hurry. It was horrible service. 

Our orders were incorrect and he made sure we felt guilty about it. 

He managed to disappear for 20 minutes intervals. The other servers did not bother checking in after seeing us with empty glasses. 

They need some serious training here."}
{"text":"We ordered a take out of ribs and salmon and were very disappointing with both. On a scale of 1-10 we gave them both a \"2\".  The fish was over-cooked and the ribs were tough while lacking flavor and tasted like they had been re-heated several times. Probably the worst ribs I have ever had.  Called the next day to report to the manager and they insisted that we bring the food back in for a coupon?  I obliged and after having the manger scrounge through our eaten food while questioning why there was not more uneaten food  I decided to take a pass on the coupon. Go across the street to Outback for better food and service.

{"text":"I ordered the beef brisket salad. It was on the lunch special. The dressing they used was sweet and tangy. The perfect combination for the salad. The service was great and fast, and very friendly. The environment was comfortable and laid back. I always have a great experience here."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Ordered 4 hours prior and the food was not ready. It took an additional 30 minutes.  No apologies given."}
{"text":"Warm salad, cold chili. Over cooked dry ribs and a skin on the Mac n cheese. Two stars because the Wilber bean were good this time. Service was slow because they had a large group in the back according to our server. The only thing brought to the table in a timely fashion was the check."}
{"text":"This place is great!  The staff is so friendly and happy to serve you.  The brisket is AMAZING, I could eat pounds of it at a time!"}
{"text":"I am not the biggest fan of BBQ, but I do have a hankering from time to time. We were recently in the area and decided to give this place a try. 

They have a number of lunch specials, as well as day of the week deals. My mom opted for the full rack of spare ribs for $18,99 that comes with two sides and a corn muffin. For sides we chose grilled pineapple and garlic mashed potatoes. While we waited our server brought out their freshly made BBQ chips so we could sample all their sauces. She went over all the flavors and we sampled them all. 

Our meals arrived and the food was good. This is one of the better chains around and I would have no reservations about returning here for another meal if I'm in the mood for more BBQ, which is usually a rare occasion."}
