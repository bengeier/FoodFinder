{"text":"This place was horrible. It was not clean. The staff did not seem very friendly, and to top it off, it was extremely cold. I will definitely not be going back."}
{"text":"It's a pretty cool concept but I had some problems. 

It started out fine. We were happy that we were only one of two groups in the theatre on a random Tuesday afternoon. We ordered an extremely expensive pizza which was ok. Then we ordered chips and queso. A young man very quickly brought food to our table. But it wasn't what we ordered, it was some cinnamon buns or something not even close. 10 minutes or so later, our server picked it up. Another 10 or 15 minutes went by, and our server brought some chips and salsa to us, explaining that they were making some fresh queso. After another five or so minutes, she brought what we actually ordered, along with our check (and no apology for the ridiculous wait). Our check? It was maybe halfway through the movie! I guess she was done with us. She came by to pick it up before I could put money in it (because I wasn't ready to pay...for one thing I like to be able to SEE my bill before I pay it), and then again, but this time she stood there watching me until I put money in it. We never saw her again after that. I would have ordered more food but never got the chance, and that really irritates me. It was my birthday.

The food is SO overpriced!!"}
{"text":"After waiting an hour, we were told the kitchen couldn't make what I ordered. An HOUR goes by before you figure that out?! The burger my husband ordered was burned. 
This was supposed to be dinner and a movie.
He tried to go buy popcorn, but no one at the bar would acknowledge him so we left the theater starving and pissed."}
{"text":"The service has definitely slipped from the last time i visited.  It took over an hour for a sex on the beach (3 ingredients, come on!) and the ladies next to me never got their glasses of wine they ordered at the beginning of the movie. The server still brought them a check with the wine on there and they had to tell the server \"no we never got them\" and the server said \"oh they're on the way, but there is only 15 minutes left in the movie, did you still want them?\"  If you're going to be a business of serving food and drinks during a movie, you sure probably perform as such.  They kept saying the bar was behind but it doesn't take 2 hours to mix drinks.  Very disappointing, won't be back."}
{"text":"This place has a really cool concept.  I love the fact that you can eat and drink good food while you relax in comfy seating and enjoy your evening.  Staff was great when we went.  We are going back our second time next week with a living social deal.  Looking forward to seeing if its just as good the next time."}
{"text":"I have to disagree with the other reviews as my experience was nothing but negative. My best girlfriend and I went there one evening in search of an experience that I had whilst I was in California. We received two free tickets to any movie of our liking and even though it is close to forty minutes away from the house we decided to go. Upon arrival we gave them our free tickets, and they gave us nasty looks. We ordered the tickets for Thor 2, and the attendant said that he would be right back. He came back a few minutes later and brought with him a manager. She told us that she cannot honor these tickets on a new release. It said in the paper good for any free movie. She then told us that the free movies were on a list and these were the only ones from which we could pick. We argued for five minutes, and she gave us nothing but attitude. She kept interrupting us, and we said that the ticket clearly stated that it was good for any film. She said in this condescending voice that we did not understand what she was saying; that we obviously did not read the information correctly. I work in mortgages and loans and my best girlfriend is a financial advisor. We are used to reading contracts all the time. I asked for her manager, and their store manager begrudgingly gave us a ticket. Her attitude towards us was a facade of niceness. 
We were not the only ones complaining as other people were in the same situation. They let everyone into the film of their choice regardless of what they saw. The majority of the people saw Thor 2. Some of the people thanked us for being assertive and expressing our valid opinion to the management team. We arrived inside, and there was a server who came to greet us. She asked if she could bring us anything to drink or eat. We declined because we ate earlier. She said that if we needed anything to hold our card up and she would come. About a hour into the movie my friend became thirsty. We held up our card and nobody came. She walked to get something to drink but another person stopped her. She told us that she would get our server. Our server never came. At the end of the movie the woman took tips at the door and thanked us for coming. She asked if we would like to leave a tip. I said absolutely not because she never did anything for us. I am not the type of person to complain about bad service, but I will complain if the service is beyond terrible. The concept is great, but they need to take some customer service advice from the theatre I went to in California. This would include  having a push button to notify the attendant that you need something, and hire people who give great customer service. I will never go back to this theatre! I will frequent my normal theatre(s) on Monroe Road or Park Road. Even though they are not as up to date with indoor fixtures, there is something that they have that Cinnebarre will never have. That would be great customer service and attendants who smile and thank you for your patronage."}
{"text":"Upon walking into the theatre the first thing that hit me was the stench! I can still remember the rotten smell of sour milk (or worse) as I type this review six hours later at home. 

There is a reason why the ticket booth is outside the cinema because by the time you realize how bad the place looks and smells, I'm not sure anyone would consider staying for a movie and (God forbid) eat anything here.  Lucky we only wandered inside for a look as the movie we wanted to see was sold out. 

Avoid at all costs - or at least take a step inside before you buy tickets."}
{"text":"This is a good concept that needs some TLC.
We went to see Iron Man 3 today. The floors were sticky, the menus were dirty, our $13 pizza was cold and small (but good)....the service was slow, but she was very nice. They dropped off food to us twice that wasn't ours then walked away. When they brought our pizza I asked for plates and they never came back, so we just used a paper towel. Then to top it off, we went to the restroom and none of the stalls we picked had T.P.!  
We saw the 1:00 movie, one would think everything would be clean and stocked and ready to go for the day? 
If they keep this going, they won't be there for long. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I took my grandmother here to see Now you see me and we loved the grilled cheese with tomatoe soup.  I also liked that it was reasonably priced.  You put your pad up to let them know you are ordering and they come to serve you througout the movie.  I also liked the chocolate shakes.  I wish they had trays instead of built in bars, as I felt I had to reach for my food and couldn't move it out of the way once I was finished.  Pay attention to the paper towels under the bar because they don't hand out napkins.  My only complaint is that the wheel chair seating is lousy and there is only room for one -- so the disabled person has to sit alone and in a corner where the viewing is lousy.  Most disabled people do not go to movies by themselves.  That was poor thinking on the part of the theater architect."}
{"text":"As with most theaters these days, it is completely over priced- even more so. A package of twizzlers and 2 packs of sour patch kids: $19.95! What? So the movie was only $7.50 per person to get in but they're slamming you on the snacks. This is for the totally lazy, I don't come to the theater to have my candy brought to me at my seat. I got it myself at the bar. This is great for a date but not for kids goin to see Night at the Museum. What a waste."}
{"text":"Will not be going back. My first draw that was tickets were $7 and had high hopes for this place. Sign out front says buy tickets at the bar. Walk in and we see a lot of employees waiting around or on break eating but did not one said a word. Simply \"hi\" goes a long way. The only person really working was the bartender and it felt awkward you ask to buy tickets when the person it ordering a drink  - but we moved on and headed to the theater. It was 90F outside and it was 100F inside the theater. Was that not something to mention when I bought the tickets and you knew I was going to be in that theater (seemed like the only one with the issue)? I thought we could push through it but ended up leaving during the pre-views after I had no idea how I was supposed to do this for the next 2 hours. You are supposed to relax, not end up with heat stroke. Asked for a refund no problem - I guess they expected it after the only other people in the theater did the same thing."}
{"text":"Never wasting money here again.  Overpriced bar food with terrible service.  Waitress took our order, food was brought out by different person.  No drinks and no waitress in sight.  After 10 minutes my wife offered to go get them from the bar herself.  She had to end up waiting another 10 minutes in line to get the drinks (missing the movie).  Then about 20 minutes after that, nearly done with meal and a different waitress comes up to bring our originally ordered drinks.  When I say drinks I mean sodas - no special bar drink or something.  Poorly managed.  Those sodas were $5 each.  Never offered a refill or anything.  This place is bullshit."}
{"text":"I went into cinnabarre for the first time a couple days ago and it was awesome! The theatre was small so it felt like a home movie theatre. My server parisa recommended a missippi mudslide milkshake to me and I loved it! Overall the service, food, and experience were great."}
{"text":"The food is decent and reasonable prices. Movie tickets are very reasonably priced! Love Mondays!!! $6 movie tixs and kids eat free! Awesome!"}
{"text":"Wheels have come off here. Walked right in - no one checked our ticket. Anyone want to see a free movie - come to this place !!!  No one taking food orders - NO ONE !!! People in the theater are all pissed.

Ran out of some beer, ran out of some food.  People bringing in food from Taco Bell it is so bad.

Seriously don't come here - this is awful.

Place used to be great - THE WHEELS HAVE COME OFF THE BUS HERE. They must be for sale, no one cares. Staff doesn't care. 

One of the biggest money making nights - They should just shut down ......"}
{"text":"Theater doesn't understand its own concept. I can go to any movie theatre and watch a movie.  Went there so we could eat a meal during our movie. Sat down before previews started and turned on our order light. Finally visited by a server 40 minutes into the movie. Waited an hour, no food.  Movie was ending told them not to bring our food.  Managers response\" not our fault we didn't staff properly\".  Must be grooming their managers for success in the real world.  Better off going to a real movie theater and watching your movie with snacks. Save the meal for before or after the theater."}
{"text":"Looooooong story short I will never be going back to this theater as this is the second terrible experience I've had there. The employees are actually nice... If you can get one to acknowledge you... But none of them have any idea what's going on here and there is zero organization. 

I am not even sure where to begin with this review... We walked in and walk right over to the bar thinking it would be easier to get at least our drinks ahead of time. We sat at the bar as at least five bar staff walked back and forth passed us as if we didn't even exist. 10 minutes later I finally decided to ask if we were in the wrong place to be served or should we move else where. After walking in circles the employee I questioned found someone to take our order. Another 10 minutes, for a bucket of beer, we finally could head to our movie. We now realize no one has checked our online pre paid tickets and no one is even at the front to do so. After wandering the halls we found the theater. We walked in and realized there are NO seats! The waiter taking care of that theater walks right passed the six people that are now trying to figure out what to do. We walked back out to the bar to find the manager already doling out other refunds to other guests. When we explained the problem the employee replied \"Ut oh! Well you guys can go see another movie...\" We let him know we were not interested and just want to leave at this point. We were finally refunded our movie and after pointing out that we were definitely not interested in hanging out at the bar to finish what we had ordered they refunded our drinks as well. Thank goodness."}
{"text":"No one asked me how I wanted my burger cooked so I assumed that it would be well-done.  Well it was not but it was so dressed up, I couldn't figure what was off about the texture until halfway through the burger.  I had to shine my phone light on it to figure it out.  They did not charge me for the burger so they fixed the problem but I hope they're working on preventing it in the future.  Besides that, the atmosphere was nice and the promotions even nicer."}
{"text":"My husband and i were really excited to use our Living Social deal on our first trip to the Cinebarre. We thought the concept of food and drink while watching a moving is awesome.  This place however falls really short of expectations. 

We get into the hot, muggy theater with sticky floors and find our seats about 20 minutes before the movie starts. The waiter takes orders from everyone around us and skips us. Once the previews were about half over her comes and takes our order. 10 minutes after that we get our drinks. Our movie started at 7:50 about 8:55 we finally received our food. I ordered the chicken sandwich. It was cold and tough. About three minutes after receiving my food i received my check. Seriously can i try to enjoy my cold chicken before you make me pay for it!! 

I was so excited to have a date night here but i definitely will not return. I can see an overpriced movie somewhere else!!"}
{"text":"Great spot! I was surprised to not see a higher ranking. Obviously a movie theater that's been around +10 yrs is going to show age. Also, If I want a gourmet meal I don't go to a movie theater. The pizza is the best thing I've found on the menu and who doesn't want a tall beer when they're catching a flick? Yeah this might be blue collar indulgences but people need to recognize what the niche of this theater is and enjoy it...don't blast it for something it isn't trying to be. If you're in the mood for a \"burger\" enjoy it, don't complain that it isn't filet mignon. The Ol beef analogy."}
{"text":"Okay food, drinks, movie...what is not to love??  I have gotten some hefty tabs here-mostly because we ate and drank plenty with the movie (instead of ordering dinner I would suggest a pitcher and maybe an appetizer).  My husband loves movies here since during the night it is adult only and you can relax with a beer."}
{"text":"Service here is HORRIBLE. Couldn't get service in the theater so we went to the lobby. The girl behind the counter told us to go back to our seats to order. I told her our situation and asked if we could order here. Her response, \"Sure, if you want to wait\". Won't be returning to this place even though it's 1/4 mile from my house."}
{"text":"Make no mistake, this place is the best movie experience you'll ever have!! The menu is perfect. They have THE BEST popcorn I've ever had, THE BEST burger in Charlotte, THE BEST pizza ever!! Obviously I love this place because of the menu and the service. I don't even bother with other theaters. This place ROCKS!!"}
{"text":"Cinnebare is a great concept- you don't have to do any work really except write down your food and drink orders and watch the movie. That said, the concept is often poorly executed, I've noticed there three or four times I've been here. 

On a Saturday night, we were one of ten other people getting tickets at the counter for the later and last movie showings of the day. The girl working the counter seemed to have no idea or concern of what she was supposed to be doing. We watched her pour drinks and take people's money for movie tickets, and then walk straight over to her friend and start talking with her friend about some bracelet she just got. It took us 15 minutes to get our tickets and drinks... Which I'd understand if the place was slammed, but it really wasn't. Where was her back up? I saw a \"management\" type in a black polo walking around, and judging by her conversations, I don't think she had much of a handle on her job either. 

After finally getting our ticket situation figured out, we head to our movie and sit down in one of the smaller theatres. I assume they save the smaller ones for movies that have been out for a while. Cute idea, but you can hear other people's conversations around you. It's also right by the back exit where they roll trashcans out to the dumpsters, which can also be noisy. You'd think this job would be a stupid easy way for a server to make money, if they're good at what they're doing, but ours only made an appearance when she peeked in and saw a whiteboard propped up (I caught her popping her head in the door a few times)."}
{"text":"I have one word: gross. I got sick when I went there from their chicken tenders. The only thing good on thief menu is popcorn."}
{"text":"Cinebaree would be the best dine-in movie theater in CLT if they were to add comfortable seats/chairs. Ijs 
Movie tickets are cheap and the food is really tasty (body snatchers are my fav)"}
{"text":"I used to LOVE this place when it first changed over to this concept. But every time I go it gets worse. This time, we got there 45 minutes early knowing it was going to be busy. No one even took our order until 40 minutes later, then our bucket of beer arrived...One. Hour. Later. I could have walked to Harris Teeter, bought beer and ice, and walked back in that amount of time. Then our food came an hour after that. So we waited over 2.5 hours for lukewarm burgers. I get that they're busy, but the movie ended before I had time to finish my food!"}
{"text":"Because I used to enjoy this a few years back (and similar venues), i didn't want to write a poor review but after (3) consistently BAD visits/experiences over the past year, prompted me to write this.  Despite the food/drinks being way overpriced (yes, we expect the 500% markup), one would expect it to be at least mediocre and somewhat ontime...however getting an order over an hour later (movie winding up) and bad food on top of that, pretty much does it for me.  Off to try Cinemark in Matthews..of course Village Theater in Ballantyne is solid, just hit and miss with movie selection."}
{"text":"We went to the movies there last night, we order dinner and drinks. Dinner was okay we're still waiting for our drinks they never arrived. Movie started and we never saw the waitress again. Left alone with no drinks in the dark this place sucks!!"}
{"text":"This is the only way to see a movie. The servers are fantastic. The bar has an AMAZING selection! Food is great! I like to get pizza. And their desserts! Incredible! I get \"half-baked\" it's warm cookies and it's delicious. Also, the menu items are movie inspired names and it's so clever!"}
{"text":"I wanted to give Cinebarre a ZERO star rating, but you are required to hit one star. WORST experience I have ever had at a movie theater. We were one of the first families to arrive tonight (30 min. before movie start time), ordered our dinner, and it came 2 HOURS later- at the end of the movie. Everyone else had their food. The manager did NOTHING -no apology, explanation, free drink, movie ticket, etc. SHAME ON YOU, Cinebarre. This is not the first time, we gave you a few chances when similar things happened in the past. Never again..."}
{"text":"This place could be a success IF they did something about the smell in the theaters. I've bn to it twice n each time I should hv enjoyed the blockbuster movies but the overpowering stench made it unbearable. If they had they place professionally sanitized, maybe it would save it from barely existing to profitable. I'd give it a 5-star rating then n visit more. I hope the owners will read this ... Or management."}
{"text":"'High concept' is both a descriptive term for and a denigration of Hollywood films that purport to deliver something novel but turn out to be disappointingly formulaic.

In a business where popcorn and a Coke and a stiff old seat were the norm for decades in every city and every cinema, the idea of serving food & beverages, including alcohol, in a stadium-style auditorium with mini-tables, drink-holders and large comfortable chairs is 'high concept' also.

But novelties wear off and the high concept of Cinebarre has been mostly undone by the old bugbear of declining standards in housekeeping and service.

1) If you arrive early for a film and want to buy a drink at the expansive bar in the lobby...tough.  You are informed that 'you can order in the theater.'  By the bartender.  Apparently, tending the bar means turning people away from the bar.  Surely the opposite of the business plan?  It must also be a difficult way to make tips.

2) A seating area with benches, tables, stools, etc. is presumably for the consumption of said beverages but with few, if any, bar sales it stayed empty and some signage etc had been chucked in the corner.

3) The place was FREEZING during a winter visit.  I like A/C.  I dislike hot weather and any place inside that is too warm.  At the time of visit it was an unusually cold weather pattern outside but it didn't seem the heat had been running at all with or without the outside doors opening frequently as is typical of any business.  The lobby was a meat locker and the auditorium only marginally better.  We were obliged to wear our coats and scarves throughout the film.

4) The place reeked of stale beer.  If you've cleaned up after a party or worked at an establishment that serves alcohol then you know the smell of beer spilled or simply left out in containers too long.  Lobby, hallways, auditoriums.  It was pervasive and overpowering.

5) The worst trend in cinema:  pre-film commercials.  Lots of them.  Played at the same volume as the feature film!  $35 for two people to listen to 30 min of adverts?  They were so loud it even made communicating with the waitress difficult.  Is it any wonder people are staying on their couches with their big screens and Netflix?  No ads, no preachy PSAs, set the volume where you like.

Personal discomfort aside, it's amazing that companies can invest so much in land, facilities and staff only to engage in practices that drive the paying customer away."}
{"text":"First time here and i thought the overall Experience was ok. our server was Gretchen and she was very nice. i ordered a beer which came out warm and flat. the pizza i ordered was the gladiator (no olives). reading the other reviews i thought this was safe. it took soooooooo long (almost and hour) to come out but its was well worth the  wait. the pizza was AWESOME and hot! I read some complaints online about the temperature in the theater being to cold, well they must have read the review cuz it was hot as hell in the theater. YOU NEED TO PAY IN CASH it took so long for my check to get picked up that im glad i read the reviews that suggested cash payments (if i used my card i might still be there waiting) 
overall
PROS: the pizza was good, the concept was good, the theatre was no freezing, plenty of leg room. silent service (wasnt disturbed by servers walking or noise. relatively clean eating space
CONS: the food is expensive. everything takes FOREVER (not the waitresses fault), my beer was flat, and there was something wrong with one of the speakers in the theaters (kept going in an out) 
would i go again....YES!"}
{"text":"Having been to iPic before and really enjoyed the experience I was terribly disappointed with this place. From the moment we walked in I was hit with the smell of stale beer, the floors were sticky and dirty. We really wanted to see the movie and since we bought the tickets online didn't know what to expect so we entered the theatre... The smell of nasty fried food was in the air and I didn't even want to order bottled water, the entire time it felt like I'm surrounded by filth, avoided touching more than I absolutely had to. I would not recommend this place to anyone I like. Big disappointment. We'll not be going back until there is a massive overhaul."}
{"text":"I took my 3 children, a friend and her son to see Turbo today at noon and was turned away because my youngest is 11 months old.  The server was rude and the management was not helpful.  The policy does not make sense if you allow children under 3 to attend 1 day per week (the policy states that no children under 3 are allowed except on \"Cry Baby Day\" and the server didn't know what day that was).  The whole situation wasn't handled well and I refuse to go back."}
{"text":"Cinebarre, a movie theater chain that is tailored toward the grown-up crowd recently opened in the Arboretum.  The theater places restrictions on small children and minors under the age of 18 without being accompanied by a parent or legal guardian (sorry older siblings don't count), providing an environment free of crying babies and rowdy teens.  

In Charlotte, this concept of adult-only dinner and a movie at the same time was popularized with the opening of the Epicentre Theater in Uptown Charlotte a few years ago.  The opening of the Cinebarre makes it a perfect destination for people in South Charlotte, Union County, and those who may not want to go to uptown all the time to get this type of experience.

The look of this theater is very sleek industrial with a touch of nightclub lounge.  The waiters coming in and out during the film were not very noticeable.  This system is also conducive to outing loud speakers, obnoxious behavior, texters, and other disruptors without needing to leave the theater since you can just flag down a waiter.  Indeed this system worked for me during my outing as it stopped a person in front of me from endlessly texting (that backlight from the phone is a huge distraction for me).

It is recommend that if you plan on getting more than just popcorn (they use real butter), you should arrive about 20 to 30 minutes before the movie starts in order to have your food ready before the movie begins.  However, if you happen to come late or just as the movie is starting you can order food anytime during the film.  The menu offers a variety of different quality foods and beverages: 

*Domestic & Premium beers
*Red & White Wines
*Sparking - Sorry upscale people they don't offer Veuve Clicquot or Roederer Cristal, but they have Moët & Chandon.
*Sandwiches (named after famous movies) offer options for both meat-lovers and herbivores.
* Finger food, \"The Replacements,\" that range in fries, chips & salsa, chicken strips, and popcorn to name a few. 
*They also offer breakfast on Sundays before 2:00p.m.
*Dessert options for the sweet-toothed.

There is a small kids' menu for when children can attend on \"Cry Baby Day\" every Tuesdays.

Ticket prices are comparable to many other movie theaters in the area, they also offer student, senior, and military discounts.  Plus, they have a $5.00 Tuesdays and on other days Cinebarre offers a Matinee discount.

Personally, I had a nice time and I would definitely come back to see another movie.  Come to Cinebarre and watch a movie over dinner, but don't forget to tip your server before you leave.  ;-)"}
{"text":"The Cinebarre is certainly a unique and mostly enjoyable movie going experience. I guess my caveat for others would be to know what you're getting into because I feel this is an establishment that caters to a certain young adult, casual movie date kind of crowd. It's not a place I would even really consider taking kids or even an adult movie buff for various reasons. For starters, you really need to get there at least 30 minutes before the movie starts. You'll need time to find some nice seats and place in your food orders while there's still adequate light. Once the movie starts, you'll be force to your mobile device as a makeshift flash light (a small reading light would be a novel idea) The theater is designed in such a way that provides the staff lanes to get in and out of rows without blocking your view however at times they can distract from intimacy of the film flow especially when taking order from late stragglers after the movie has already started.   The food and drink selection offers good variety. Everything I've had has actually been quite tasty (although I've heard other people who have not shared my sentiments), pizza was fresh and full of flavor and the \"princess leias\" (mini cinnamon buns you can get w\ ice cream) are my favorite. It is a nice feeling to have access to adult beverages if you feel the need for a tipsy movie experience. Service can be hit or miss depending on how packed the theater is but they're usually pretty friendly and helpful. The screen\sound is pretty average across the board although I've been in some where the screen seemed a bit dim or the sound wasn't quite as strong. Definitely not a place to come to on a budget, if you include the price of movie tickets, couple drinks, couple of snacks easily could spend $60 before you even realize it.  Bottom line is this, if you need a good one stop shop movie date night on a flick you aren't dying to see every detail of, by all means this is a worthwhile experience. Don't expect the best movie watching experience nor the best food around as you could probably find a separate restaurant/movie that would better suit particular tastes. For all it attempts to do, it gets a lot right even though it may not doing any one thing exceptionally well."}
{"text":"Three out of the last four movies, our order was taken by a waitperson. The remaining time, nobody ever showed up. Of the three times our order was actually taken, no food arrived twice. The remaining time it took an hour to get the food. Today, no food. The people next to us got their food after a 90 minute wait. As you would guess, the food isn't very good, even when it is delivered, so I guess our experiences are actually positive, we managed to avoid having to eat it. Incompetently managed, mediocre food at best, why come here? The only positive is the buttered popcorn, all else should be avoided. We are going to start bringing our own food."}
{"text":"Food a bit pricey for what you get but you are paying for it to be served at a theatre. ..of course there is a premium.   Typical bar food but I wouldn't have expected anything else.   Wouldn't mind if it was a bit cleaner."}
{"text":"Probably the best theater ever. Waitress service in thw theater, full menu and full  bar available to be delivered throughout the move. Very comfy seats too!
After my first visit I am wondering why all theaters aren't like this. Ticket prices were less than a lot of theaters, food was very reasonably priced and the sound/picture quality was excellent.
I'd highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Disgusting inside. Usually a solid experience, but was deeply disappointed... short-staffed and behind schedule which meant the theater didn't get cleaned between movies."}
{"text":"I've been to Cinebarre twice now and enjoyed both experiences. Good beer selections that include some microbrews on draft and bottle. The flat bread pizzas are good and tasty. Can be pricy if you order too much, but still a fun time. I took my wife and two boys to see Jurrasic World and everyone enjoyed the experience. Easy to order and service doesn't interfere with the movie. We watch most movies at home these days but found this to be a cool option that we would try again."}
{"text":"Sorry...we have no butter for the popcorn. Seriously? You're a movie theater. Setting that aside, the pizza and chicken fingers were decent. The youngest enjoyed her grilled cheese. But the no butter thing earns you two stars, which I think is generous."}
{"text":"I was excited about this theater opening and was hoping it would live up to my expectations.   I've gone several times, the first time was when they first opened.  Had some drinks at the bar before we went in, ordered food once we sat down.   The pizza was pretty good but cold, as was the food my friend ordered.   Service was horrible as well.    A few months later I thought I would give it another shot (maybe things had improved) ....nope same cold food and annoying server that kept interrupting the movie to pick up the check before I was done eating!  I had to tell him to leave me alone it was so bad.  The sound quality is also majorly lacking in this theater.   Sadly the nicest part of this venue is the bathroom.   (Really nice)  lol Anyway recently tried Studio Movie Grill in the Epicenter and was top notch compared and believe it or not cheaper."}
{"text":"A nice place to see a movie where you can order food and drinks and served inside the theater. A good size theater with spacious leg room and a bench to put your food. Salt, pepper, ketchup and paper towel roll are conveniently placed on the bench. Kids under 18 need to be accompanied by adults."}
{"text":"Great place to go for dinner and a movie all wrapped up into one..... There obviously aren't a lot of places to compare this to in the Charlotte area but Cinebarre is a much better experience than Mez in my opinion. The rows of seats in each theater are set up with a companion row of raised bar shelves right in front of where you are sitting and that is where your condiments are located as well as a place you can set your drink if you'd like as well as any food you want to order. The ordering system is pretty simple, there is a notepad where you just write in what you want in sections such as \"drink,apps,main dish, desserts\". Then the waiters will stop by and pick up your sheet and run your order. The layout of this place is a real good idea because to accomplish the waiter service they have just removed every other row of seats in order to make a alley for the servers to get to in so they can move around to every person seated without drawing any attention away from the screen. Also, if you want to, you can clarify with the waiter what you specifically wanted with your order if need be or you can just simply be more detailed when you list your order on the notepad and they will grab the tab and run your order without any fanfare. I found the ordering system to be similar to comedy clubs. Also, when the wait staff does need to interact with you they always seem to use whispered tones since after all you are in a theater and they don't want to bug any of the people around you too much.

As for the food, they pretty much have a lot of your standard \"bar food\" such as pizza, chicken tenders and chips/salsa. We were fortunate enough to get to sample most everything they had and it was all pretty much par for the course. 

The price of a ticket just to see a movie is 10$ for a standard, 7.50$ for a matinee and they have a 5$ tuesdays special. With the prices set around 4$ a beer and 12.50$ for a pizza you could get into a moderately priced evening of around 30-40$+ if you hit a movie here whilst hungry and thirsty. 

This probably isn't the cheapest movie option out there but for sure it is a nice way to treat yourself if you'd like to have some top notch service with your movie."}
{"text":"Concept?  5 stars.  Food?  1 star.  Service?  5 stars.  Theater setup?  3 stars.  Average: 3 stars.  

The concept is fantastic. The bartenders and servers do a solid job and are super customer service oriented.  Nothing I love more than a beer delivered to my seat during a great flick!

The food was unfortunately inedible.  The sliders tasted like microwaved frozen White Castle burgers. The fries were frozen and heated then cold again.  The pickle chips....don't even go there.  They are over-salted industrial metallic tasting discs covered in a hard fried cold thick tasteless batter. Might be frozen and re-heated as well.  The pizza next to me didn't look half bad and I admit I had food envy after tasting my fare.  Couldn't eat more than 1 pickle.

I wasn't too fussed about the food, as we went to drink some beer while watching a fun movie.  We accomplished that!  I do love the concept so much that I'll give the food a pass.  Although can you imagine how great it would be if they stepped up the kitchen and actually cooked instead of microwaving everything?  It would be a true joy.  

Next time I'll stick to beer and popcorn.  Although I could just sneak some beers into Stonecrest and buy a tub of popcorn...but I'm an upstanding citizen and don't like to break the rules (much;)...."}
{"text":"If I had the option to give zero stars I would considering the fact that neither I nor my husband received our food, and we were in different theaters! No one ever came to tell either one of us that we were not going to get our food.  At least my server had the presence of mind to take my sandwich off the bill but my husband was presented with the full bill.  Total lack of care and attention.  At least the movie I saw was entertaining."}
{"text":"Expect what you get for with this place, naturally.  However, BEWARE that they sometimes show movies in this room the size of a walk-in closet.  This NEEDS to be disclosed in their movie listings before people drive all the way over there and discover they are going to be stuffed in what the manager told us was the \"birthday party room\"!!  Seriously?   How can you put a first run movie...the day it comes out...with big name actors...in such a theater?   I wouldn't even go watch a last run movie in that small dungeon!  There seriously needs to be a GIANT asterik in the listings for whatever is shown in those.***

The only thing going for this place is the rosemary popcorn.  Super good!"}
{"text":"Came here with my husband on Friday night to watch The Commuter. At first we loved the look of the place, felt really retro and different. We arrived in the theater in our seats around 8:00pm for our 8:30pm showing. We sat and waited for someone to come and take our order for about 10 minutes. We then ordered chicken tenders for my husband, and a mozzarella sticks and garlic knots appetizer tray for me around 8:15. We also ordered waters and a shake. They promptly brought out our beverages which was great. The movie started around 8:45, still no food. 9pm, still no food. We pressed the button for our waitress to come out so we could get an update on our food, but no one came until around 9:30. At 9:30 she rewrote our order and said it'll be out shortly. At 10pm the waitress came out again and said they'll be putting our order in to-go boxes since the movie is almost over. At 10:15 she came out and gave us two boxes with two orders of chicken tenders because they didn't have enough time to make the appetizer tray. 

They're service is an absolute joke so i don't recommend going here if you're hungry. :)"}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan.

I recently broke my leg, so my ability to get out and about has been hindered, but that didn't stop me from having an amazing time at Cinebarre.

As soon as you walk in, you see these huge posters of some classics draping the walls.  From Jaws to Vertigo, to anything in between.  Many of films I would love to see at this venue.

I sat at the bar waiting on others to show.  We decided to get a few apps while waiting.  The goldfingers are some mighty tasty chicken fingers.  Arabian nights, some great hummus with some tang.  I also tasted the chasing amy.  That is one I've got to get a hold of again and get a little more than a bite.  Its basically a grilled cheese with tomato soup, but it seemed deeper than that, almost like a tomato bisque, have to get more than a bite next time, HAVE TO.

While sitting at the bar, I encountered a few different friendly staff members but one that seemed to take a special interest in making sure that my drinks stayed properly filled was Lauren, highly recommended.  After proper libations it was time to get to the theater to watch the campaign(great movie btw).

Even on crutches is wasn't that hard for me to get around.  As soon as we sat down we were introduced to our server Allie.  She was like a little ninja running drinks and food for us without disturbing us or the ones around us.  The 2 pizza's we ordered were both great but the chicken run definitely stood out.  A great bbq chicken pizza, reminiscent of the first time I ever tried a California pizza kitchen, maybe even better.  The other, the braveheart was good, just not as good.  All this time Allie is bringing us some house red.

Afterwards, I sat at the bar and talked to who I assume was a manager, maybe even had some ownership interest(forget the name), about what he plans to do in the future.  As well as finding out what specials they have.  I hope I talked him into putting an IPA on tap.  They've got a decent selection, but it just isn't complete without at least 1 ipa.  My only complaint.

All in all, it was an absolutely great experience and will hopefully fill a well needed niche in Charlotte.  Your turn to take the neighborhood kids to the movie? Why not have a couple glasses of wine.  Want to take a date to dinner and a movie, but want it more interactive than 2 people just staring at a screen for 2 hours?  The perfect spot.  So many excuses to go.

Specials:
All week matinees are only 7.50 till 6pm
Monday-kids eat free
Tuesday-$5 movies
Wednesday-$2 domestic pints(be sure to ask which ones)
Brunch menu on weekends starting at 9:45am

SEE YOU THERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'd had this place bookmarked for a while, so when I finally had the opportunity to visit I was super excited. 

The setup is similar to other theaters where you can eat full meals and drink, you write what you'd like from the menu and prop the card up and they bring it out to you.

It's typical movie prices here, but I love they the items are all named I reference to movies. I kept it simple and just ordered the bowl of popcorn and a coke. Everything was fine, my only complaint is how far the tables are from the seats! I wish there was a tray that folded out or down so I didn't have to reach so far for the food. Perhaps this is only a problem in the higher rows...next time I'll sit lower and see if the table seat ratio is better. 

But overall I enjoyed the movie and my experience. The service was good and there are a couple other menu items I'm looking forward to trying. It makes for so fun date night or girls day out so I'm sure I'll be back!"}
{"text":"$5 movie Tuesday's! Doesn't get much better then that. I have gone to Cinnebarre several times now, the first couple of times I went, the service was a bit spotty as they were working out their kinks. It was not a big deal for me. All new businesses have growing pains. It seems to me that they have it down pretty good now. I do recommend getting to the theater at least 15 to 20 minutes before the show starts. I also prefer to get a bucket of beer ahead of time, that way I do not have to wait for the servers or mess with the menu cards during the movie. You also basically get a free beer when you buy a bucket. There are no beer specials on $5 Tuesday's. However, all other days of the week they have really good drink specials. The menu is pretty basic with some apps, pizza, sandwiches, and burgers. Personally, I would stick with the pizza. The veggie burger is pretty good also and is probably the only somewhat healthy thing on the menu."}
{"text":"I've tried this place time and time again.... And it's still the same awful experience every time. I'm not really sure why I kept giving it more tries. The customer service is absolutely horrible. Every once in a while we will get a great server, but usually not. I am a server myself so I understand the job. No one ever makes us feel welcomed or comfortable in any way. No one ever checks back on us or our food. I believe in earning your tip. And that requires some kind of service. Literally all the the server ever does is take the order and puts the order in the computer and never comes back, until the check is ready of course. And every time we are there, it's a completely new management staff. That says something doesn't it? I think the concept of the theater is great, but they do a poor job of executing it. Should really consider going back to the old theater that was there before. I mean what's the point of having servers if they do absolutely nothing. Oh and also when you ever have a problem don't even bother saying anything, they could care less. The servers just moan and grown and don't even bother to get a manager. Read all of the other reviews below mine..... Save your time and money.. Do not go here."}
{"text":"If I could give this a zero I would. When we walked in, there was a sign for \"$10 bucket of beers\". Then we ordered two buckets of coors light. When we got our check they were $20 each!  They screwed the people around us too. I absolutely will not be coming back here. Don't waste your money of him on these scammers."}
{"text":"I have been to Cinebarre previously and was not impressed but when I went this past Friday to see the release of Gangster Squad my faith was renewed in this place. 

Our server Garret did a great job with our theater. I'm not sure if he enlisted help or if they have a team mentality but I thought everything was brought to us as efficiently as possible. 

The popcorn is brought to you in a big silver bowl and if you want butter they use real butter that gives it a very homemade taste. My husband got a pitcher of beer which I believe was $13 for yuengling. Definitely not that bad for a Friday night. 

The drinks were very good. I got a sangria and my friend got a mimosa. All of the drinks have clever movie related names which I thought was cute. They are line priced with a regular bar, but I thought they were well worth the price. 

This was a great experience. I think an action movie or a comedy would be best to see here because people are fidgeting the entire time, and you need a not serious movie to be able to fully enjoy it. 

They also have fun events which I would like to partake in including brunch on the weekends and $5 tickets before noon on the weekends. 

I think one of the things I appreciated most was that you can get a pitcher of girls drinks. I do not drink beer so anytime I can get a cider or a pitcher of mimosas I am one happy girl. 

Just one last side note is that I have found free tickets to this theater in the Charlotte Observer so be on the lookout! 

The only reason why I did not give this 5 stars is that the waiter mixed up our orders when giving us the check. We were a group of four split into 2 pairs and there wasn't any way to tell him what went on what ticket because they drop it about 2/3s of the way through the movie. 

I had a fantastic time and we will be back!"}
{"text":"While I wished that my first experience at a movie theater as such would be pleasant...it was far from it. I invited friends and family to go to see South Paw here as a anniversary/birthday event for myself and my husband. When we ordered our food I was hoping to have great food returned to me in a timely fashion...did not happen. When my food was brought to me my shrimp was crunchy and my fries were burnt. I guess they assumed I wouldn't be able to tell since it was dark...wrong! Anyways, the servers were great and professional but the cooks need a lot more work. I don't know what goes on in the kitchen back there but they need to get it together. 

Oh before I leave this comment I will say that there was an issue with one of the servers. They failed to acknowledge the party sitting in between my family and I. This couple had been sitting in their seat before my group arrived. However, our order was taken first and the servers never greeted or took the couples order. It wasn't until the wife began to get really upset and started getting upset with us (as if we did something) until I realized what had happened. I immediately went and got a server and informed them of the issue. 

I probably will not be returning to eat. If I do go back I'll only order a drink...which I hope doesn't get burnt...who burns WATER?!"}
{"text":"Cinebarre's concept sounds good in theory. However, they way that it is executed here takes away from the experience of going to the movies. First off, your seat has a counter in front of it with a white board to write on. You leave the board with an order, stick it standing up, and someone comes to read it and bring you what you wrote down. The problem for a small woman like me is that this counter/table thing in front of the chairs obstructs my view of the movie screen. It is extremely distracting to have wait staff walking around the theater during the entire movie. Its hard to order because you cant see the menu or the board you are writing on. You have to fish through your purse and use your phone for light. This is also very distracting to the people around you trying to pay attention to the movie. The food itself is average and way over priced. I prefer the traditional grab dinner and then going to a movie rather than trying to do both at once."}
{"text":"Positives: Our server was really friendly and the movie was good.

Drawbacks: The bar area smelled like they were mopping it with a dirty mop. 
They did not understand how fandango tickets worked or they did not have plans to receive people with fandango tickets so I ended up standing in line even though I had a prepurchase tickets.
Since we were coming for A late lunch we ordered quite a few things off the menu. While our food came quicker than other patrons it was burnt  and mediocre at best. 
Final thoughts: Great concept very poor execution. This has the potential to be a great place if they could get their act together."}
{"text":"I like this place,.... It has potential. I've been to theaters with the similar makeup ( Alamo Draft house in Austin) so I had a comparison.  Cinebarre does well to mix  a casual vibe with a more commercial feel.  I love the fact that you can eat/drink while watching your movie.  The wait staff is very attentive and the food is good.  I've had their pizzas, chicken tenders,fries and fried pickles and they were all up to par. They have a pretty decent beer selection with bucket specials. It's also reasonably priced for the area.
    I am excited that they play The Walking Dead on Sundays.....I just think that's really cool.  
    I look forward to them expanding their repertoire and hopefully adding Indie flicks and festivals."}
{"text":"Came here on date night last Saturday and had a great time. Arrived a little early and some a drink and some apps at the bar. Service was friendly and prompt and the chicken fingers and mozzarella sticks were quite tasty, especially the chicken fingers. 

We then moved into the theatre where we placed an order for some popcorn with REAL butter and a pitcher of beer. Again, service was prompt and friendly enough but it was busy. 

In order to get a good seat make sure you get there 20-30 minutes early and just order a drink, a snack and sit back and relax until the movie starts."}
{"text":"The theater was clean and comfortable. They were out of hamburgers and other food items. ..we went on Sunday ! Only thing being served was fried foods!  The prices are too high for what we received. We purchased 3 meals and 4 drinks and it was over $70!  We
Will return to theater but will not eat our dinner  or any food there again!"}
{"text":"I am hooked.  Yes,  it costs more but it's worth it to me:
No sticky floors
No obnoxious patrons due to their age policy
Great food and drinks without leaving my seat

Awe... Some!"}
{"text":"Great place for a quick casual dinner & a movie.  The service was pretty efficient and prices are very reasonable. Love the fact that you can sit down and get \"table service\" while in your seat for the film.  After the movie, there is also a pool table if you want to hang out and shoot a little pool while you have another bevvie."}
{"text":"If anyone is a popcorn snob, Cinebarre has the best popcorn.  It is served in a large stainless bowl and it taste like its coated with salt and real butter.  I could not believe how good it was!

Cinebarre also offers bar food, brunch on Sunday, early movies, booze, $5 Tuesdays, they also show TV shows on certain nights and they were showing the Super Bowl when we were leaving..  

Seems like a nice neighborhood bar vibe even if you aren't seeing a movie.  A great place for private events too.  A great addition and let's face it, sometimes when you want to see a movie, you do go to one that serves booze, even if it is a trek."}
{"text":"It's a cool experience. I would not suggest going however for a movie you know will be crowded because you're all up on the person beside you (Which can be good if you like or know the people on both sides of you) and have to eat and share counter space and it gets to be a lot if you actually want to eat. The food here is good. The last time we went to a late showing and weren't let in until after the previews had started because they were still cleaning which kind of sucked but overall I love this place."}
{"text":"I'll just copy and paste the email I sent to the company:

I just wanted to leave some feedback on my visit to your Charlotte theater this morning.  I took my three year old daughter to her first movie, hoping it would be a great experience.  I've never been to a theater with a full menu, she loves to snack while watching movies.  I thought this was going to be an over-the-top-amazing trip for her.  We arrived and purchased our tickets to see The Croods from the bar - the woman who completed our transaction didn't say a word, other than giving me the total when I asked for \"two to The Croods\" - no personality, conversation, smile whatsoever.  The place was entirely empty. We sat down in an extremely dark and from what I could see unclean (trash on floor, sticky counters, etc.) theater and waited for ten minutes before a server appeared to take our order.  She didn't really give us any information about how the ordering process worked except to tell me that she would drop the check 45 minutes before the movie was over.  We ordered a chicken strip meal, a diet coke, a kids chicken strip meal and popcorn.  That's well over $50 with tip, food and tickets included.  The chicken was tough, overcooked and not worth eating.  The french fries were the only decent part of the experience. The popcorn was burnt and stale - likely leftover from the night before.  The movie was cute, and my daughter loved it.  The experience was horrible and I won't recommend your theater to friends.  I can't believe you charge what you do for food that could be made better in a bar and popcorn that isn't even fresh.  A movie theater that serves old popcorn and charges almost $8 for it?  Is that the business plan you have in place?  Honestly, I can't believe you expect people to pay so much for such a poor experience.

I hate to be such a negative nancy, and I do choose to leave feedback with companies when I've had an exceptional experience as well, but this was by far the worst and most expensive-for-what-you-got experience I've had lately.

Thanks for your time,
Jillian"}
{"text":"This is the best kept secret that needs to be leaked..... great date night and ask for Bailey  or Gabriel or Michael.. hell the whole staff was awesome..."}
{"text":"So, Cinebarre can be just a theatre, just a bar, just a restaurant, just a hangout spot in the evening (pool tables and live music on some nights), or all of these compiled into one spot for an outing. I'm not usually keen on theatres that show national releases, but Cinebarre makes for a unique experience that is accessible, can be affordable, and one that can be had on a whim, if need be. 

The staff is so friendly and they really work to make sure you come in and get what you're expectations beckon for. We walked in, intending to have brunch and a movie, and they asked us if we wanted to order our food before we went in to the theatre. Once seated, our server came to our seats within a minutes to take our order and make sure we had correct the menus. Where the brunch menu isn't anything spectacular, the fact that they take your order, serve you, and bring you the check all before the movie is over is just fantastic and pain-free.   

One of the other things I love about this joint is $5 Tuesdays. Much like some of our other AMC theatres in town that do $5 weeknights, you can check out a movie on a Tuesday for so cheap. Two for the price of one. Makes it a little easier to justify a few drinks before and during the film. 

Bathrooms are also spectacular. Dual entrances/exits, excelerator hand dryers, clean as a whistle. Much appreciated on this front. 

So happy that a cool and easy place like this is south of Uptown. Looking forward to many films to come. Hopefully the hobbit in December! Cheers, Cinebarre!"}
{"text":"Arrived to find out a 1:50 showing wasn't showing after all, even though it was listed on their website.. Next showing for the movie wa 3   hours later .Apparently, Cinebarre is in the process of being taken over and showtimes  are getting mixed up! Frustrating. Exceptionally small theatre, too, maybe only 20 seats."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Cinebarre - I love the dining and movie concept. My hubby and I got a chance to visit on the 4th of July for a matinee, we caught an early show so it wasn't super busy but the service was just a nice.

We arrived 30 minutes before the show and was able to place an order.  We weren't super hungry but you have to have popcorn!  The popcorn here is awesome - fresh, hot and buttery! They also show indie shorts before the movie - which is cool!

A few folks during the movie made additional orders and it wasn't at all distracting - which I appreciate! 

I think we'd venture out again to Cinebarre on a more happening night when we can take advantage of the bar and adults only atmosphere."}
{"text":"I really was excited to check this place out.  Unfortunately, our experience was a disappointment.  The place looks really cool and it's a great idea... just executed poorly.  We paid $10 for a Long Island.  I'd be surprised if there was even an ounce of Aristocrat premix in it.  I've had many a Long Island in my time and this was surely all sour mix.  Neither my husband nor I could bring ourselves to drink it.  I got a mudslide which was good.. but again... I feel certain I was shorted on alcohol for the price I paid ($10).  I was freezing the entire time but I guess that's typical for a movie theatre.  All in all I felt everything was ridiculously overpriced even for movie theatre standards.  To top it off, there was no toilet paper in the bathroom stalls.  

I left frustrated.  I definitely would have bought more than one drink even at $10 had it been made correctly.  I feel like I got cheated and for that I'll never go back.  Bad business."}
{"text":"I avoided this place for two years thinking it was too expensive for me. I was right and wrong. The movie tickets were about the same as you'll find elsewhere. The food is a bit expensive. I got a burger and fries, my wife got a pizza. If I could do it again, I'd get a pizza, but both weren't worth what I paid. I recommend getting something that can be eaten by hand because once the lights go out, you can't see the food. We got a bucket of beer (5 for the price of 4). Again, $5 for a bud light is a little pricey in my opinion. I ended up spending about $60 for food alone. There is much better food in Charlotte for that price.

But I suppose it's about the experience. If you go, get there early and get in your seat. The theaters are pretty small. My wife and I went straight in and picked seats right in the middle (in hopes that people wouldn't walk between us and our food if they got up during the movie). A group of 8 or so women that purchased tickets in front of us stopped at the bar in the lobby. They got into the theater later and couldn't sit together. You can order drinks in the theater, no need to stop at the bar. The service we got was excellent. I'm glad I experienced Cinebarre, but I probably won't be back.

I did see an ad that said they open during Panthers games for free with drink specials. That might be worth checking out."}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times. 

This place is enjoyable.

The employees are  nice and welcoming.

The seats are comfortable and the sound is good.


There is more than popcorn or candy here .

You can get pizza, burgers, milkshakes and desserts. 

There is a stocked bar too.

I'm just not a fan of employees delivering food/drinks in the middle of a movie and people chomping down on stuff too ...nom nom nom....chomp chomp chomp"}
{"text":"Save your time and money.  No customer service and no food service. Can't imagine how this business stays operating with subpar service."}
{"text":"How did I not know there was a movie theater that offered tickets for less than $7???!!! 

I mean in an era where tickets are like $10/$11, this is a steal. A STEAL I TELL YOU!!! AND I GETS LIQUOR??!! Get outta here! 

Now if you like some upscale, really clean, up to date place, this ain't for you. But if you're cool with the vintage ambiance, greasy menus, old moldy mothball smell, and spaced out seats from the bar then you'll like this place. 

Alls I need is some decent food (if I want it) and to be able to watch my movie in peace. All at an affordable price. 

I ordered the moonsticks (mozzarella sticks) and they were good. Soooo good. Maybe it's because I haven't had these in a while. But damn I love me some mozzarella sticks. I also had an alcoholic drink (strawberries and something or another). It was aight. I had a cold and was hoping this would open up my nose some. 

The only annoying part was that my drink came waaaaaay later after the movie started. I made sure to place my order at a reasonable enough time to get it before the movie started. I had to press the button to get an update on this. She came to tell me that they were swamped so it was taking a while to get to it. I'm fine with that, but I'd like to get an update without pressing the button. I mean I waited like 30 or so minutes for a drink. Maybe I'm having a flashback of Studio Movie Grill when I had horrible service not once but twice. 

I'll go back. No one or place is perfect and besides waiting a while for my drink, I mean that's nothing compared to having to pay stupid prices for other movie theaters. Also, it doesn't look like that many people have either caught on to this place or they just ain't feelin it. That's okay by me! More space/food for me!"}
{"text":"As far as movie theatres go, it's ok. Nothing too fancy. I know others get excited about having a waitress to take your order while watching the movie but I think it's somewhat annoying. The tables are set too high in the theatre so if you're short like me, it's hard to see the screen over the tables. I also don't really like having someone run the orders back and forth in front of me while watching the movie. With all these complaints, I guess I won't really need to come back to this theatre. I can continue to bring in my own popcorn and drink somewhere else:)"}
{"text":"Seriously understaffed... poorly organized.
Fine when it's not a big movie but really poorly handled for large movies"}
{"text":"Once was enough for me. My friend and I went one day to witness an experience of food and cocktails whilst watching a nice film. I received, on random, two free tickets to a movie of my choosing. I called a friend, and we chose the dreaded Hitman film. As we arrived, there were not too many cars in the parking lot. The place was deserted for a Friday evening. I showed them my tickets and the person grabbed her manager. The manager came out and told us that Hitman did not apply to the films from which we could pick. On the ticket there were no exclusions at all as stated. She said that they had to start putting on certain exclusions due to film popularity. We could only see four films that everybody had seen that came out earlier in the summer. We complained until she begrudgingly let us in. It was her attitude that was horrible. 
We went inside. The theatre smelt nasty. Midway through the movie, I went to get popcorn. I went to exit and the server stopped me. She stated that she would come right up to take our order. She never came. At the end, she apologized and asked if we wanted to leave a tip. Never before have I been so angry. We went to a different manager, and complained. She wrote us a free pass to another movie. I told her to keep them, and that we would never be back at this awful place. I will never go there again. If anyone has had similar experiences I would love to hear them"}
{"text":"I cannot wait to bring my husband here for date night. 

We don't even have to leave our seats to be served! They have a well-thought concept! They offer personal pizzas (which are large enough for two to share, unless you are super hungry), a variety of beers and wine, milkshakes, and more. When you want to order, you just shift your order vertically and it will grab the attention of your server with very minimal distraction, if any.

Looking forward to my return."}
{"text":"Bar food and a bar in the way. The thing that drives me the most crazy about this place is that they have a BAR in front of you where you sit as your table. For someone who is 5'4\" this bar is almost eye level so I have to sit on the edge of my seat to see. Wth. 

The food is ok but definitely food you would get at a tavern.  It's the most convenient theater to my house but many times we will drive further away to other theaters that are more comfortable."}
{"text":"This movie theater used to be good but not anymore.  The waiters our horrible they bring out cold food, no drinks and when you need extra service they are no where to be found.  I just came back from the theater and I was so disappointed with the experience today.  I would ask to speak to the manager but I don't want to be bothered with these guys anymore.  The floors are still sticky, honestly if I could give 0 stars I would.  I bet if people stop going there you would get management to respond and look to get things better.  I'm taking my business to smg in the epicenter."}
{"text":"So I was very excited with I heard this was opening near my house. The Arboretum had gone down hill for awhile and I knew they were trying to revitalize it and I thought that this theater would help. So here's what I do like... they are convenient and have a full bar and serve things like coke floats!! They also show Monday night football, Downton Abbey and the Oscars on the big screen (how cool is that!!). They don't allow underage children in the theater unattended and I've seen them repeatedly enforce this rule.  The seating is fairly decent no worse or better than any other theater so yay for that. However the things I don't like kind of get in the way. So here we go: the food is gross! Pretty much everything I have tried here has been sub par and I know many a bar who serves better bar food which is essentially what Cinebarre is dishing out. The fried pickles, mozzarella sticks, pizza, burgers, french fries, hummus (how do you mess up hummus??), everything, it's all just gross.  The only upside is their brownie which was pretty good and the popcorn which is also good and plentiful.  I want to love this place but I just can't get past the yucky food :-/  

One other thing I'm not a big fan of is that they have pool tables and a bar that people can loiter around regardless of whether or not they are seeing a movie.  You get a lot of people visiting their friends who are working and just hanging about and I foresee that leading to trouble in the future."}
{"text":"Annoyed every time I come here now. Used to be great but has gotten worse with each visit. Bad management I think. Ahh, confirmed that. Just now, my wife's wine glass had lipstick on it. Not her's, new glass. Management was huffy.  Not anymore. Trying Epicenter dinner theater."}
{"text":"It's changed hands or something and now they serve all that delicious craft beer in plastic glasses.  Yes Plastics. Like at some sort of outdoor concert. I don't know what's going on with the food either but it wasn't that great to begin with and now it's just completely a mess :(  We keep trying and trying to go here because the concept is amazing but every time we go it's just a mess. They also don't do the ice bucket at 6 good beers anymore! But will be happy to serve you could beer in a plastic pitcher with plastic glasses. Yuck. Yuck. Yuck. 
I do so wish they could get it together......they just keep going in the opposite direction.  From now on...we go to theatre on Monroe Rd."}
{"text":"At a normal movie theater a soda is like $8-$10.  At cinebarre I can get a beer for $4.  Alright cinebarre, you cleary friggin win.  A ticket at Cinebarre is about the same as anywhere else you would go to see a movie.  The food here is not bad at all and I really do like their pizza combinations and names.  There servers are never in your way and all you have to do is write your order on a piece of paper and push into the slot inf ront of you.  Voila your food and beverage have arrived.  The waiters and waitresses never get in the way either when you are ordering and when people are ordering in front of you.

The only thing to take away from this is at that in can get a little expensive for a date night .  Figure $21 for the movie and our meal 4 beers and 2 pizzas ($44) has turned going to the movies into a $70 experience. I t does feel nice to feel like you are at home with a nice movie and your food and drink around you, but at this price i might just skip the food next time."}
{"text":"This is something fun and different to do with just your date of a bunch of friends. Cinebarre has a welcoming u-shaped bar when you walk in and a wide variety of beer and wine. I saw posters that said they have $5 movie nights (think it was tues or wed) and then they also have $2 draft nights on either tues or wed. Sorry. Cant recall. Had some wine while exploring in here :) I was here during a Yelp event and sampled their fried pickles, tomato soup/grilled cheese sandwich, chips and salsa and pizza. All good, but pizza was like the pizza I make at home. Very fresh and not doughy with cornmeal crust. I built my own and it did not disappoint. It was even delivered to me during the movie (The Campaign) and I enjoyed it with a Stella."}
{"text":"I originally left a Yelp tip that the Fandango times were wrong for this theater, as Fandango said the show I wanted to see started at 1:20 and the Cinebarre website and the marquee behind the young lady selling tickets said 1:05.  From Cinebarre's website that said to arrive 20-30 minutes prior to the show to get settled and order, my arrival time was 12:45.  I sat in that f'in theater for almost an hour before the move actually started.  That was not a happy beginning to my theater-going experience - get it together.

The young lady sitting in front of the incorrect movie time selling tickets was very pleasant.  A Thursday 1:05 pm (1:20 pm!!!!) show cost $7.50.  The facilities inside included a huge bar and some pool tables.  Chairs around.  Everything was very clean.  The bathrooms were numerous and clean (no paper towels, but they do have the super high powered hot air hand-dryers). 

I went to a movie that had been out for a while, so it was in the smallest theater at the end - I guesstimate it held about 50ish seats.  The seats were comfy, plenty of leg room.  The arms do not go up and down like most theaters do anymore.  There is a counter that runs along the length of the row in the small theater, with paper towels mounted below the counter.  There was wheelchair accessible seating at the top of this theater.

About 10 minutes prior to the movie, a young man came in and took my order and said that 40 minutes into the show he would be coming through with the check to take care of.  

First came my popcorn with butter ($7.50) served in a metal mixing bowl.  Meh.  I've had better, I don't see the AWESOME POPCORN that I read in some of the other reviews.  It seemed to have actual butter on it, which was fine, but the popcorn wasn't fluffy, it was kind of pitiful.  Where's my drink?  While I was waiting on my drink, my popcorn was getting cold.  About 10 minutes later, here comes my 32 oz. Coke ($5), served in a hard plastic cup with ice like a restaurant.  About 10 minutes after that, here comes my Half Baked ($6), which is 4 chocolate chip cookies that were warm from the oven - they were awesome and the highlight of the visit.  But for 6 bucks, I could have made a couple of dozen take and bake Tollhouse cookies - but whatevs, it's a movie, I expect to overpay.  

The delivery of the items, for everyone in the theater, was a mess.  Whoever was serving the food would just come in the theater and look around asking if that row ordered the item.  Luckily, only 3 other rows were seated - but wtf?  There are numbers on the end of the aisles, correspond the order with that, right?  I was not impressed - not at all.  I hope there is a better system in place on Friday and Saturday nights, and maybe this sloppy service is just during the week when it's slow.  Never again.  

The movie itself and sound were fine.  The sound was a little loud, but that drowned out the ill-behaved children, so that was fine.  The theater was cold, but I have no complaints about that - it was 91 degrees outside, so I enjoyed the cool air.  

The entire theater was clean and the staff were friendly, but overall, I was not impressed.  I'll stick to Ballantyne and Stonecrest where I can get my own popcorn and drink prior to the movie at the same time."}
{"text":"Went here with family and friends. First, as with any new establishment, there will be some bugs to work out. We had some drinks at the bar before the start of our movie. My sister ordered some potato skins. We had to ask twice about them as they were very tardy to our bellies. They were average in quality. We sat down to watch our movie, they took out every other row to add in row-length tables. You circle what you want on the small menus and hand them in to your server. So here's where another bug comes in, of the four of us attending a very hilarious Will Farrell movie, only myself and my friend next to me managed to receive our food. My sister and her husband never got theirs. :( But, we approached a manager upon our exit and she gladly handed over some complimentary tickets for our next visit. All in all, a great idea, just needs tweaking."}
{"text":"The cheap movie makes up for the food cost that is mediocre - kids love the idea of dinner with the movie so we like it. Small seating area in the theater so get there early if you want to sit together."}
{"text":"This place has awesome deals ! Mondays- Thursdays they have $6 movies all day. And keep in mind, that's ALL Movies .... Even new releases. 

The popcorn and milkshakes are delish! The service really depends on how crowded the movies are."}
{"text":"Just learned that all admission is $5 on Tuesdays and Wed. is $2 draft. I got a huge mimosa in a beer glass for about $5. Also saw a sign about Monday Night Football being shown at Cinebarre- worth checking out!"}
{"text":"There is just no reason to go to any other movie theater.  My movie watching experience is greatly enhanced by the very comfortable seats, the high quality beer, and the ability to have some decent food.  Yes I often think of Billy Connolly screaming \"eat at home.\" but I enjoy this perk greatly.  The set up is quite clever, you take your seat, there is a menu and some notepads.  The waiter comes by and you hand them your order and you can swipe your card right there.  If you need another beer during the movie you just push the button and then they come by and take your order.  Is there sometimes a delay?  Of course there is!  If only there was something you could do while you were waiting!!!!   Is the food four star dining?  No!  But it is quite decent.  I would like to see this trend continue and expand because I very much enjoy having a quality beer and a comfortable seat while watching a movie."}
{"text":"I was here for lunch and a movie.  The food is better at McD's, honestly.  Service was ok considering they're trying to not get in the way of the movie.  I had chicken fingers but I suspect they were microwaved they were so rubbery.  

I really wanted to give this place a better review, I had high hopes going in.  But, it was pricey for what you get and sub-par food with little taste.

One redeeming quality:  They show student films instead of tons of commercials.  That was really cool.  Go for that, and to see a movie, but skip the food."}
{"text":"Shitty service and rude bartenders! That beeotch Megan with the blonde top knot working the bar with an attitude needs to step back and check herself. I tried killing her with kindness but she burned that bridge to the ground. I can't help that Cinnebarr and Fandango are not on the same page. I can't help that my digital 50 Shades of Grey ticket said theater 2 but theater 2 was showing Paddington and Megan missed how to freaking print a ticket day (which she printed for the same theater). I can't help the entire theater smells like a brewery. I can't help you Cinnebarr were unprepared for the rush on 50 Shades of Grey movie but I had  your $10.50, walked up to your ticket counter prepared and you were not prepared for me or any of the 50 ppl (pun intended) in your lobby. I was a loyal customer b/c you had a niche in the market but now I'd rather eat afterward or maybe b4 as the smell may kill my appetite  

Note: the pitcher of Sangria we ordered never came. Instead we got a bucket of beers with 3 dirty glasses."}
{"text":"Love the concept - and if I was just writing this for the movies it would be 4 stars. However, the food leaves much to be desired and the service is very juvenile..."}
{"text":"I'm a very positive person, but I'm hard pressed to find a positive thing to say about my experience here. The venue is nice and staff is friendly, but after that it goes downhill. The lines on Friday night are crazy so get there early if you want to actually see a show. We were there 30 mins early and order a pizza, some appetizers and a bottle of wine. It tookTWO hours to even get a glass of water, let along our meal. Once we finally got our food, at which point the movie was almost over, it was COLD. In my opinion, there is no excuse for that. The concept of this theater is great, but with the horrible food and service, I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Ticket prices are very reasonable for what you're getting.  I love the ability to order in the theater.  I got the chicken tenders and an OMB Copper.  Great meal!  Also, it doesn't allow kids under 18 without an adult, and no kids under 3, period.  So, if you want to go see a movie without distraction, this is a good option."}
{"text":"We used to like this cinema a lot because it's close to our house and has decent food. The past few times we've been, it has not been that great of experience. It seems like the service is super slow and they seem to always be out of something. After tonight's experience I doubt we will be returning. Not only did we (and the people next to us) have our lights on for service for a solid 15 minutes before the server made his way to us, we were told that if the food couldn't be put in the fryer, then we couldn't order it. Unbelievable. I truly don't understand why you would be telling customers that when you have a super extensive menu. So basically our only options were fries and chicken tenders. So my husband and I each ordered that because it was our only food option. When it came out, my husband had no sauce with his chicken tenders and both of our fries were cold. He was told twice that the sauce was coming, we never got it. Super disappointed in the whole experience, thank goodness we used a gift card for our tickets. It was a waste of 30 dollars, not including the money we spent on food."}
{"text":"Used to be a regular here but as many reviewers have noted things have taken a bad turn. First the ticket seller doesn't ask for my regal card and then when I offer it and she disregards me and then she shares that I'll need a manager --no apology for her error.  Then my theater is an icebox literally. I'm in my heavy winter coat and still freezing while others go to their cars to get coats and blankets. Food  service is slow and expensive with consistently cold fries. All in all I won't be in a hurry to go back."}
{"text":"It's a decent concept, but not certain I enjoyed it. Customer service is good and the theater is relatively clean. We did not use the restroom, so I cannot speak to this. Wasn't bad but not great. I think they are trying to do a little too much and they are not great at it."}
{"text":"The food is always good,  most of the time wait staff is great but have an issue with front of house business.   

First they say you can't get the \"point\"  for the purchase of your ticket if you get your ticket through fandango.   OK really cause the Regal app for purchasing is powered by fandango. 

Second if you get food through the movie,  be careful as they add random charges to it without you knowing.   Be sure to go over your bill with fine tooth comb.   

Third,  their new computer system adds random taxes but doesn't state it anywhere on the bill except in the Cc total line. So technically they are stealing and most people are not catching it.   We brought it to the managers attention and she couldnt do a thing about it. 

Great for a movie but other wise don't purchase anything there since they like to scam people's cards."}
{"text":"This is a great way to enjoy a movie. Full bar, draft beer, pub fare, all while sitting in your comfortable theater seat. 

The venue was great. I will still go see IMAX movies when there is a great action flick out, but for a great relaxing night at the movies, this can't be beat. Waitress service at your seat with a bar in front of you for your food and drinks is great. Whenever I needed a refill or we decided to have something else to munch on, just wrote down our needs on a white board and the waitress came right over to take care of us. 

Highly recommend you try this if you haven't before. We will definitely be back. It has redefined our movie nights!"}
{"text":"We were in theater 11 on 11/11/17 to see Orient Express. The theater felt like is was not heated at all. The temperature in the theater was colder inside than it was outside. (It was 50 outside). We let the waitress know we were not comfortable before the previews and noted that everyone in the theater were still in their coats. Just before the feature started we again asked the waitress to raise the temperature. She said that she informed her manager Vanessa and the temperature was raised. We decided to stay, but the temperature did not appear to change. Needless to say, snowy scenes were very cold. We gave up asking for heat and stayed. At no time during the show did we feel any change in temperature.
After the show, we noted how much warmer it was in the hall than in theater 11.
As we left, we asked to talk with the manager, Vanessa, and she told us the temperature in the theater was not in her control. All she could do was to call a number and request a three degree increase. 
This is clearly unacceptable. Why would a business deliberately place patrons health at risk by not making paying customers comfortable?
Vanessa made no apology and offered no alternative.
Clearly, this theater should be avoided when the outside temperature is below 50. We will not be back."}
{"text":"I absolutely do enjoy this experience!

It's quite unique to be able to sit down at a bar before a movie, which makes it the perfect date spot, although I wish they served liquor : / Just wine & beer.

The décor is cool & has a hipster meets industrial meets modern look.

The staff isn't as accommodating as I would like but its still a great experience! You get to order food from your seat, you have a little table in front of you to eat at, and no one's view is affected whatsoever by this clever idea to eat & drink at your seat!

The BEST thing they offer, by far though, is their once a month LIVE Rocky Horror Picture Show experience! Its definitely a MUST but be sure to buy the PROP BAG, its just not the same at all without it : )"}
{"text":"Note, this review is a little biased... 
I came here for my very first Cinebarre experience, and what can I say? I had a blast. Of course, this was during the Yelp Elite event. However, I'm going to give it a review as if I was there without the event. Now, you must be wondering... What did they do to the old theater?

Well, they remodeled it. Put a bar in the lobby, as well as two billiard tables, a small corner stage (with single seat couches), and basically covered the walls with pictures of the greatest movies of all time. They also added a menu filled with amazing food too, just a small detail... So yeah, I guess you could say they have changed quite a bit. 

So how this works is that after you buy your movie ticket, you can either hang out in the lounge, bar, what have you. Or, you can go inside the movie theater and order food. I noticed when I walked in there were tables right in front of the seats. Sticking out and laying sideways was their ordering form. Also, laying on the table is their full menu. Now, order what you're craving, put that piece of paper upwards and someone will come and jot your order down. Then, either during the movie or before, someone will come by and just drop off your food. And, the food can be ordered anytime during the movie.

Now, understand that they will be walking in front of your view even though I was really happy and amazed to see that they were trying their best not to, which I sympathize them for breaking their back. So, personally I think this feeling of a movie theater with food gives it more of a \"home-esque type of feeling. Oh, and those napkins? UNDER THE TABLE!! I totally did not see them as they were very hidden, which was awesome.

There's one problem I saw during the movie. Since there's a table in the front, it's going to be hard for people that are \"vertically challenged\". Now, it's not horrible, but at the same time it's going to block a little of the view unless everything is moved out of the way. Hey, eating a full pizza (that's delicious) can give some reason for the blocked view, right?

*I recommend going early if ordering food. Because if you have trouble seeing in the dark it's going to be hard to read that menu.. Even though they do not completely turn off the lights it's still dark*

Now, during the end of the movie they will come up to you and ask for your money if you did order food. (Either that, or you can charge it right there on the spot when you order the food I believe.) 

Overall, my experience was unbelievable. I enjoyed every aspect of it and even though there were some downsides I really respect all those who work there, as I can imagine how big their staff is! The service was superb and I will definitely come here if I decide to eat dinner, and want to watch a movie at the same time. Now, that's what I call knocking two birds out with one stone."}
{"text":"Had a great time out at the movies today! Not over crowded for a rainy Saturday! Service was quick and polite.  Prices were not that bad for service during a movie. Had a really laid back and fun atmosphere! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This was a unique and interesting experience in movies and dining. This is my first in-movie server dining experience and I really liked it. I went to see the movie Loopers and it did not seem like there were nearly the pre-movie ads that I usually see at movies, BIG PLUS. The waiter was friendly, helpful, and I left him a nice tip (he earned it). 

The chairs were a little uncomfortable, I guess I am used to fabric seats that have some movement. 

The food was yummy, however it would be nice to have a healthy option as a side for sandwiches other than fries. The grilled cheese and tomato soup was too die for! So delicious. 

I liked the cozy, small theater experience. It would have been nice to have small lights above the food in order to see what you are eating. Loved the decor, bar, great movie posters throughout. These people are on the right track."}
{"text":"No one took our tickets when we entered and anyone could have just come in and seen any movie for free. No one at the bar helped us when we had been sitting here for 15 minutes. They say to arrive 30 minutes before your movie but food orders weren't taken until 5 minutes before the movie and weren't delivered until 35 minutes before the movie ENDED. The only helpful thing was that the tickets were cheap and our entire theaters concessions were comped for the bad service."}
{"text":"When I heard about the Cinebarre, I thought, \"this is too good to be true\". But, here you have it, folks-- straight from the horse's mouth: such a heaven on Earth exists.

The Arboretum Cinemas was a typical hangout for my friends and I when we were in high school, but compared to Regal, it was pretty dumpy. As an adult, I would never have thought of venturing back there, but since the renovation, it's made a new name for itself. Think 21 and uppers. 

I absolutely love that on most nights, only 18 and up are permitted entry, and although you will see families there, it's not the norm.  I know that if my husband and I want to go have a few beers, a juicy burger, and catch a new flick, we can do all of those things in one fell swoop. 

A few weeks ago we had our date night at the Cinebarre. Because we arrived early, we sat at the bar which was reminiscent of Happy Days and ordered beers and burgers. My blue cheese burger was to die for. It came on one of those massive, spongy buns that doesn't disintegrate from a few minutes worth of burger grease and melting cheese; it stood its ground and held that patty all the way until the last bite. 

The beers on tap are noteworthy too. Although they of course offer the regular ol' Budweiser, Millers/Coors, we found Ranger, Highland Gaelic and other tasty delights. After stuffing our faces, we played some pool, and then went to look for some seats.

The theaters are all pretty small, which creates a more intimate setting. What's nice is that you don't have a huge crowd of people all around you, which ultimately compels some folks to think that it's okay to whisper, talk, text, or be rude and disruptive in general. The only drawback in some of the smallest show rooms is that if you don't get a spot on the very back row, you wind up with a sore neck at the end of the movie from tilting back the whole showing. 

Now-- here is what absolutely kicks @$$ about this theater-- ready?!
You can order beer during the movie!!! I know-- I'm as easily pleased as I am amused, and if you know me at all, you know how I love to laugh. But seriously, waitresses come around during the movie to check on their patrons, and if you have your order card standing up tall, they come grab it and fulfill your order. Their popcorn is really yummy and not loaded with all of that fake oily MSG-laden butter like other movie cinemas, so I always order it and of course a bag of candy. Candy is candy, so sadly there is nothing special to report on that front (Hint hint Cinebarre!! Maybe you ought to try your hand at specialty truffles or some other dessert delicacy!). 

The service is always good, and on every occasion that I have been to the Cinebarre, I have left happy. It's a fun night out and something a little different."}
{"text":"Sound for the movies blows but nice environment. Didn't eat the food, but loved getting a glass of wine with a movie. In the future I won't see movies that need surround sound at this place, but other types of movies will be great."}
{"text":"Save yourself a headache. Poor service and the rudest bar tender I have ever dealt with. After we had not been waited on as previews were almost over I went to the bar to see if I could place an order and was told, not unless I wanted to sit at the bar and wait 30 minutes. I went back to my seat and finally was able to place an order just as the movie started. The cold mediocre popcorn came in a steel bowl 30 minutes later with no drinks in sight. They showed up 15 minutes after that. The friends that came with us didn't receive their sodas until an hour into the movie. They were not given a ticket to sign but they were charged after they left. They should have been comped. What a lousy setup!
Needless to say, 4 more lost patrons."}
{"text":"We enjoyed \"42\" it was a great movie, but we were absolutely miserable due to the freezing temperatures in the theatre.  I asked the waitress to have the air turned off, but it was useless.  I recommend bringing your winter jacket and wear closed toe shoes!!!!!!!!  We only ordered drinks and warm cookies, they were fresh and yummy."}
{"text":"Coming from the Los Angeles area, I really did love the concept of this place. They have a full bar and games/pool and such, to enjoy when you arrive before your movie. In town for Christmas, we though it was a great chance to catch the new Star Wars. My husband and I had two rounds of drinks at the bar, then headed into the theater. We then had two more rounds of drinks inside the theater. My major gripe/complaint is that the charges for my drinks at the bar were not the same as what we were charged in the theater. We were drinking double shots of Jameson, on the rocks, with a little water. At the bar, we were charged $17 for each round (two drinks total). In the theater, it was double that, around $36 for two drinks. Imagine my surprise when we get two appetizers ($15 total for the apps), and two drinks each, and the bill is $85! They charged for each shot, at the rate of the first shots. When you order a double, you should never charge for each shot. The second (double) shot should always come at a discount of some sort. I'm not sure what their business practice is, but that just doesn't seem right. $85 for 4 drinks and two apps? Ridiculous. I wouldn't have ordered drinks inside the theater if I knew that was going to happen. Either the bartender out front didn't know how to charge correctly, or the server inside didn't. Was not very happy with our experience, and felt very ripped off. Won't return. It's distracting, anyways. Especially when the food runner is delivering things throughout the theater and barely even trying to whisper."}
{"text":"This was a great first experience.  With such affordable ticket prices, I expected that I would pay exorbitantly for my food and beer.  That wasn't the case and a nice surprise.  Beer was on par with most bars for premium draft and the food was a mid-price.  Beer selection was good and the food was good as well.  I will be back."}
{"text":"If you enjoy sound so loud it makes your ears ring, then this is the place for you.  We asked several times for the sound to be turned down and it never was.  Don't understand why a theatre thinks it is OK for the sound to be so loud it is far beyond comfortable."}
{"text":"I was very pleasantly surprised.  I've only ever been to one theatre before this that served alcohol and food and it was a long time ago in college.  I loved the setup.

I wasn't sure how they'd pull this off.  Comfy seats with plenty of leg room and a bartop to eat/drink from. And for theatre food....i thought the fried pickles and blue cheese burger was way above average.  

I even got to drink a decent french rose.  

The screen and sound were excellent.  

I will definitely see a movie here again.  Kudos to a theater trying to think outside the box."}
{"text":"Christmas movies are always a chaotic experience I imagine for theaters. I had a a complicated refund and the manager went out of his way to help me correct. He also brought my phone back to the theater because I forgot it and then got roped into taking an inpatient customers order. He took the order without complaint or hesitation. Truly impressed. This has not been my experience especially with the uptown studio movie grill!"}
{"text":"I couldn't think of any knocks against this theater.

First, it is not your traditional theater. It is age 18 and over only. So kids and crying babies are not allowed in the theater (except on Mondays when kids eat free) They also have a $5 movie night on Tuesdays and other special events (check the site for these. Ex. Breakfast club on Sat and Sun and College night with $2 domestic pints). The concept is a movie theater you can go kid-free and enjoy a drink and even food during the movie.

When you walk in you can see murals of classic and blockbuster movie posters lining the entire place. It has a very cool vibe for nostalgia. The lobby is very open and comfortable with a bar in the middle serving your favorite drinks and a lounge area complete with pool table. At the bar, they have TVs showing silent movies.

Once inside the theater, the rows are spaced nicely and each has a bar area complete with menus, condiments, and they even thought to put a roll of paper towels underneath the bar. Waitresses pop their heads in from time to time and you can signal them you are ready to order just by putting your menu vertical. They are very discrete taking your order so not to interrupt the movie for others.

And the food? I went to an event where we got to sample many of their offerings. I did not have one bad thing. The pizzas, sliders, grilled cheese, brownies, nachos...all were delicious. I would easily consider this an all in one destination if I were to decide on a dinner and movie night.

And because of the bar area and lounge area in the lobby, you could make this a stress free dinner and movie date place."}
{"text":"Hands down the best place to catch a movie. I mean who doesn't love to watch movies drink beer and have tasty food at the same time! I try very hard to go to all my movies at this place it's amazing period."}
{"text":"Both of my experiences at this theater were awful. The first time I went, it was not great. They did not have mozzarella sticks (did not mention while ordering), and then after the waitress returned with the food she mentioned it. The food we ordered was worse than expected (we did not have high expectations to begin with). We ended up going back there this passed weekend and they did not have anything at all. The staff was embarrassed and we were for them. They didn't have any candy, coke, mozzarella sucks (again), milkshakes or ice cream at all, or fries. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"One word- GROSS! Okay two words - FILTHY. I had to read some of the other reviews to see if I went on an off day. I'm not the only person complaining of the uncleanliness of this place! Sunday evening 7pm showing (premium price movie ticket). We arrived 30 min before showing so we could order our food and drinks before the movie. The theater room was unclean. Tabs from the previous customers were still on the table ledge. Ok, I gave them benefit-of-the-doubt that we were early. We waited on the side aisle thinking someone will come and clean right? There was a Nalgene water bottle on the table. An employee came in and saw us standing there and from the looks of her and comment she didn't know why we were not seated. We said to her that we didn't sit down because the tables were not cleared yet. She apologized and said she will get the person who worked the last shift come and clean up and that it should've been cleaned. Another employee came in and picked up all the tabs, pulled off some paper towels and wiped a spot here and there. No cleaner spray, no all over wipe down and the Nalgene bottle was still there. My husband's complaint was he couldn't find any clean seats and that the food was too pricey. If we hadn't already paid and looked forward to a movie night out, I would leave. The first employee came back and said the person who worked the shift already left work so the person who actually cleaned wasn't the one responsible. We pointed out the Nalgene bottle was not picked up even after the other employee 'cleaned'. How could you clean and miss the Nalgene bottle?!?!? Now came the food, one beer, one cocktail, side of or french fries, one pizza and wings (total $65- ridicous!!). GROSS! The marguerita cocktail was made with bottled mix not lime juice as stated on the description. French fries were cold and dry, tasted like frozen fries and was a very small portion. I didn't eat the pizza nor wings so I won't comment but my son said the pizza was not good. It didn't look good to me. I've been here when this theatre changed to Cinebarre and liked the food even though its pricey. It appears as if they haven't cleaned this place since then. The hallway reeks. Just a bad experience all around. Nothing good to say about it. This place will close if they continue with highly priced horrible food and filthy seats/table. The few good reviews I have read are based on the concept of movie and food. We have been to Asheville Pizza and Brewery who had this concept down. Cinebarre needs to learn from APB. Charlotteans have other better options in town or drive to Ashville and see how this concept should really be."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever and they do not care.  I can't believe Regal would put their name on such an establishment.  The staff always seems annoyed and that they hate being there and not enough staff on duty.  This is not a fluke thing, I am the fool that gave them 3 chances.  2 servers a screening is not enough.  I went to the counter to order to save time, she said \"I am not authorized to run the cash register\".  When I pointed out that she was running a credit card and just saw her hand someone cash, she rolled her eyes on walked off.  We left the theatre and drove 7 minutes to Cinemark for a WONDERFUL experience. Trust me, it is worth the drive and was 7 dollars cheaper too.  They even served drinks.  Avoid the joke of Cinebarre and go to another place, they are the worst in service and you will just be frustrated with the lack of service and hospitality."}
{"text":"It is quite a hike for us from Uptown but it is worth it when you get there.  Plenty of parking and easy to find.  The lobby is huge and has a pool table while you wait for your movie to start!  The bar has a nice selection of beer and wine.  The food is movie-themed - very fun!  While you are in the theatre, it is easy to place a dinner order and your food comes out pretty quickly.  The pizzas are great and the waiter keeps coming back to check to see if you are ok.  Great spot!"}
{"text":"I like the idea here..basically more than just a standard movie theatre.  This is pretty much a movie theatre with waiter service for beer/wine and basic bar food.  Don't get me wrong, I love the fact that you can have a beer while watching a movie (and someone brings it to you), but i guess my expectations were higher.  You can't pick your seats which is a bummer.  Worth considering and definitely much better than the old standby theatre."}
{"text":"I must have asked 8 times to 8 different people for them to fix the focus problem.  After 45 min and my eyes and head hurting from looking at a blurry screen, I had to walk out."}
{"text":"Loved the popcorn in the stainless bowl.  Service was great! Sangria with a flic?  I'm in!"}
{"text":"I've been to Cinebarre so many times since they opened. I was so excited when the \"new\" (back then) dining/movie concept came so close to home!

I love being able to squish a movie and dinner together - otherwise a movie never happens for me. I also love that you have adult beverage options, a couple of times they even had specials. You can do a pitcher or a bucket of beer if you think you'd like more than 2 beers in 2 hours and don't want to have to wait on the waiter. 

We've been lucky with the service, but I have seen it get rough for other people before. Going early exponentially increases your chances of good service. They obviously have a routine and coming in late screws it up for them. Does everyone know how it works by now? I bet you do, so I'll skip that part. 

I've tried a few things that were surprisingly good. The BBQ chicken pizza = very good, the grilled chicken sandwich = pretty good, sliders = pretty good. Popcorn = hotter and better than a \"real\" movie theater. Also tried the hummus once, but felt like the serving size was too small for the price.

I will say the food/drinks here are pricey. As others said, you can easily drop $60 before you know what happened. I thought it was bad news on my last trip that they recently increased their prices. But, it's not something we do every weekend and it's definitely a good idea for a date night. 

They have $6 movies on Tuesdays too!"}
{"text":"So I walked into the theater, which was aaaallllllll the way in the back.  There were about six rows total with a long bar to put your food/drink.  I thought \"ok, where are the rest of the seats?\"  I literally turned around.  Nope!  There aren't 15 more rows behind me.  This is it.

After getting a good laugh at the size of the theater, I took a seat and looked over the menu.  It took a little while for the waitress to show up and take the order (about ten minutes) even though we had the button pushed.  I ordered a glass of red wine with a burger and side salad.  Wine was a little slow to come out, while food came out pretty quickly.  Wine was good, and so was the food.  I would recommend the burger if you go.

Overall, a decent experience.  The menu is pretty standard (pizza, burgers, sandwiches)...almost like you're eating at a sit-down restaurant with a movie and no cloth napkins.  I would recommend this place if you want to do \"dinner and a movie\", but at the same time.  It's great to go see a show around dinner time when it's too early to go out before, but too late to eat after.  This gives you the best of both worlds."}
{"text":"Caved and went back recently because friends wanted to. This place is still a nightmare. One server for a packed theatre. Not a single employee in sight to check tickets and direct you to your theatre. When you do track down an employee they are total jerks. Honestly it feels like you're on a hidden camera show but the big haha reveal never happens. They actually oversold our showing by 5-6 people. These people ended up sitting on the floor to watch the movie. On. The. Floor. Y'all the floors in this theatre are the stuff of nightmares. Sticky and covered in trash. 

The cool thing is now so many theaters are putting in reclining seats and bars/better food options. So you can get pretty close to the experience that this trainwreck is supposed to offer but actually have a good time! 

Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place just based on the concept alone and don't get me wrong the concept of sitting down and being served by a waiter/waitress is great.  But that alone doesn't make me fall in love.  I need great food and I need the food to be delivered timely more importantly.  That's about the only downside to the place but unfortunately, hungry me doesn't like that.

The upside to the place is the decent beer selection and the nice atmosphere found at the bar.  I really like the large stainless bar and the seating is comfy."}
{"text":"Horrible terrible service EVERY.SINGLE.TIME. Don't bother complaining though because it will not fix the problem. The only reason I have gone here as much as I have is because if you are actually able to order food it's usually pretty damn good. Love their sliders and fireball whiskey shots!!! It's just unfortunate that the service and prices are so miserable. Also, if your under 18 they probably won't let you in without someone 21 or older. They turned away my son and his girlfriend. Good news is that it's not usually very crowded. I can't imagine why.  Sorry for the harsh review but that's what happens when your service is consistently bad and you obviously don't care!"}
{"text":"First, I would never say this is in Quail Hollow. This is smack dab in the Arboretum. 

My first two times I went to Cinebarre I was NOT a fan at all, but kept being dragged back because it is convenient and movie times seem to work with my schedule better. I have now gone several times and have become a fan, mostly because of the food!  

As far as the movie experience goes, it is OK.  Because of the nature of the seating, you have a bar almost at eye level which takes some getting used to. And while having wait service through the movie sounds like a great idea, it is annoying when a waitress comes by with you bill 40 minutes before the movie is over. It absolutely ruins the movie since at that point you have to lean forward and try to quietly have a business transaction with the waitress while not bothering anyone around you AND not missing any of the movie.   And I will guarantee you that at some point during the movie, someone will accidentally kick the metal cover to the stands and make a loud dinging noise. 

So why do I like it? The FOOD IS SO GOOD.  You can't beat the convenience of dinner and a movie at the same place, especially around the Arboretum/Stonecrest area where wait times for dinner on a Friday night can be over an hour at some places. At Cinebarre, you can go, sit, order, and not miss any of your movie.  I tend to go to bed early because I am super cool, so getting dinner AND then staying up late enough to see a movie was not happening for me.  This way my old, tired butt can watch a movie and have dinner and still be home in bed by 10 on a Friday night.  (Again, it's because I am so cool). 

On to the food, which has really changed my opinion of this place.  I am not a meat eater, so I LOVE the Braveheart pizza which is spinach, sun dried tomatoes, artichokes, garlic and goat cheese.  Not only does it taste good, it is big enough for two people to split for $13.  In addition to a variety pizzas, they have the standard bar fare of cheese sticks, chicken fingers, wings, all of which have adorable movie themed names like \"Some Like It Hot Wings\", \"Children of the Popcorn\" and \"Soylent Greens Salad\".   There is also a full bar that serves wine, beer and mixed drinks including a Donnie Daiquiri and a Lolita Margarita.  And don't forget about dessert!  Try the Princess Leis, 6 cinnamon rolls dripping in vanilla cream frosting. 

This past Sunday I went to the 10:50 am movie, which in retrospect is a GREAT time to go. We had 6 people in our theater and the ticket price was a mere $6 vs the normal $10.50 rate. (TIP: Movies are $6 ALL DAY on Tuesdays).   The full menu was available but they also have a brunch menu available Saturday and Sundays before 2pm. I had a hard time choosing between the French Connection french toast, the Desperado burrito with scrambled eggs, peppers, black beans and cheddar but ended up choosing the Breakfast of Champions, a pizza with ranchero sauce, scrambled eggs, goat cheese, spinach and tomato. It was DELICIOUS.  I ate half of it there, reheated the rest later the day and am craving it so much I am thinking of going to the movies again this coming Sunday just so I can have the pizza. 

Is it perfect?  No....but given the other theaters around town, I'd choose Cinbarre any day."}
{"text":"Sooooo disappointing. We went here on a Thursday at 4 for an animated child's movie. There was no one at front so we went inside to purchase tickets.  Here they informed us that our 2 year old was not welcomed at this theatre. I was speechless. I reminded them that we were going to see a kids animated G rated movie. They told us that they only allow 3 and up at this theatre. I think it's a ridiculous policy; however you can refuse business to whom ever you want. But truly it's an inconvenience to tell our kids we are going to a movie and then disappoint once we are there in a policy they do not have posted on their site or building. My husband and I frequent this theatre on a weekly basis for date night but after this we will not be giving them our business."}
{"text":"Here's what they do well: food is ok (a bit pricey) and the wait staff is pleasant. 

Here's what we had an issue with: 1) we went for NYE showing of The Last Jedi and the volume for the trailers was OVERWHELMING! There were 6 of us and all of us were extremely uncomfortable. My husband's hearing isn't the best and even he was blown away by it. It was causing extreme agitation for one of our daughters to the point she had to retreat to the top to manage. We asked the staff about the volume and we were told the volume wasn't going to be as bad for the movie. 2) It was a cold evening (under 30 degrees outside) and my husband kept his coat on, as did my daughters. I had a vest and my puffy coat on as well as my scarf. Still cold. 

My .02 worth. Really the review should be 2.5"}
{"text":"It's a great concept, but it was just kind of ok to me. My service was slower than I wanted it to be and I had to sit on the edge of my seat in order to reach the eating area in front of me. They told me that they don't have to-go cups, so you're drinking out of a standard glass if you have a non-alchoholic beverage. It was very dark and I was worried about sloshing. The movie experience was great but the dining experience was kind of uncomfortable for me. In my opinion it would have made more sense to have rows of long/narrow tables with comfortable swivel bar chairs."}
{"text":"Well this was our first and definitely last time visiting this theater! The only good thing about it was the movie. The theater smelled quite old and dank. My daughter and I wanted to try this theater because friends mentioned they had gone there so we decided to give it a try, well big mistake the staff was almost non-existent and we decided to order food and really wished we hadn't because it was terrible. Do not go here and if you do eat before you go we had the chicken tenders with what was supposed to be honey mustard but it tasted like the spicy mustard I often get at a Chinese restaurant but it was horrible and burned my sinuses like fire and the tenders didn't seem to be cooked well and the cinnamon rolls were cooked too much and the icing would kill a diabetic it was straight sugar no chaser! Avoid this place like the plague!"}
{"text":"Good food considering its a theater. The burger is excellent.  But the waitstaff is terrible and slow."}
{"text":"Ok, here's the situation.  It was a Saturday afternoon and raining cats and dogs. What to do with my 5 year old daughter?  Go to the movies right?  So off we go to Stonecrest.  When I couldn't find a parking space I knew I was in trouble.  Of course every soccer mom and their kid had the same idea and the movie was sold out.  CRAP.

I go on my trusty phone and saw the same movie was at Cinnebarre.  I'm a man who learns lessons quickly and I purchased my ticket online through Fandango and we drove to the Arboretum.  I was a bit skeptical because when I was younger I went to the same theater with my friends so I thought it would be a bit run down.

It's a bit different here you know?  When you walk in there's a nice sized bar with tables and chairs.  I even saw a pool table.  We were early and walked into the theatre and again, different.  There are less seats, but they were comfy....leather high backs with a row table in front with a menu and an ordering card.  Everything on the menu from Appetizers (wings, cheese sticks, hummus and pita chips) to full on meals (pizza, burgers, etc...).  I ordered the popcorn for my daughter and I along with 2 dinks (32 OZ).  Prices weren't that concerning to me since you're in a movie theatre and nothing seemed unreasonable.  They had a full beer and wine menu also for the people that are into it.

The waiter came buy and answered questions.  He wasn't the friendliest, and customer servicy, but whatever I was there for the movie.  We got our drinks and popcorn before the move and it was served in a silver bowl like at home with real butter.  Very classy.

It was a good experience, and I think the reason I liked Cinnebarre so much is that it wasn't crowded with 5 million people.  I like that.  The food and drinks being served was an added bonus.  Great place for a date IMO.  If I were to nit pick I'd have them clean the menus up literally, they kind of stuck to the table.

Other than that.  Nice experience.  I will be back."}
{"text":"This place rocks the Casbah! 

As the shell of the old theater that used to be there, Cinebarre is exactly what this area of town needed - a fun, easy going place to take a date, your kids, your mom out for a nice night. 

Forget the stuffiness of Mez's theaters uptown and the bad parking at Ballantyne Village, Cinebarre has ample parking, great food, full bar AND great movies showing all the time!

We really got the red carpet treatment over here - from the Braveheart pizza I had (vegetarian, amazing, better than Brixx and Mellow Mushroom!) to the comfy seats and great flick (Will Ferrel rocks), the only thing that could've made my experience better was if it was a double feature.

With a $5 Tuesday special for movies and a menu I can't wait to try more of, I'll definitely be back - with friends!"}
{"text":"The drinks are overpriced and the movie selection isn't the broadest, but I have a good damn time at Cinebarre every night I go. I could blame it on the alcohol, which is right around $10 a drink whether you're having a simple rum and Coke or a grown-up milkshake (and they aren't stingy with the pour), but I won't. Something comes through at Cinebarre; you can tell the proprietors really love movies! It's in the awesome poster art hung on the walls, the comfortably intimate theaters that periodically house special screenings and hold movies way longer than other first-run places, so if you waited around for a flick you really want to see, chances are you can catch it here. They've successfully created just a good, laid-back adult cinephile vibe. And the floors are never sticky."}
{"text":"I have raved about this place since going here for the first time a week ago. I can drink while watching a movie? And wait...you'll bring me more drinks and I don't have to get up? And you're sure I can watch the movie while eating and drinking? Sold! This is a neat place. The seats were comfortable and the theater is spacious. 

That was all I needed to hear. The food is to be expected...classic American fare. Nothing extraordinary, but the Pamburger was pretty good. 

The only drawback is you can't see what you're eating since it's so dark, but a cell phone works in a pinch. The table is also quite far from the table, so you can't lounge back and ear, but you can get over that. 

All in all, an enjoyable experience. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"I saw a movie here on a Sunday afternoon with my boyfriend when the weather was gorgeous outside but we really wanted to see a movie. It was not very busy in the theater but that is to be expected on a gorgeous Sunday afternoon. 

This was our first visit and I was very curious about how customers could eat dinner and drink beer while watching a movie in a theater. 

I was impressed! While we did not order food, we did order drinks. The ordering process is explained on order forms kept on the bar in front of your seats. There are ample menus available and while I was doubtful at first about the response time from wait staff, I was pleasantly surprised. Everything was delivered in a very timely manner and our check was brought just before the movie ended giving us time to pay but allowing for time to order anything else we wanted. 

The logistics of this process amaze me and they do it very well."}
{"text":"Nice idea.....saw Taken 2 last night. Had a pretty good time. The table is far from the seat so you have to put tray on your lap. I had chicken strips. Very generous portion and fries were as well....both were good. My husband had Cineburger and that was not that great. He said he did not like it. I had a bite and agreed. I also had a Splash (mix drink) it has Sangria in it - good- and my husband had bud light. We had dessert included was Princess Leias cinnamon rolls....they were not as soft and fresh as we were expecting. All of this had a total of $41.  Bar is nice and the drink prices are reasonable. Just wish they had a better food menu that included more options."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time Tuesday. I was very impressed. Small theaters, great menu. Great vegetarian options and everything was very good."}
{"text":"I hope this review actually makes it to the owner/operator of the theatre. This is the 3rd time that we have come to Cinebarre and not received something that was actually on the menu and had to wait 10 - 15
minutes at the bar for someone to process our fandango pre purchased tickets. 

1. The concept of serving food and drinks is awesome and sets the theatre apart. It just is consistently not up to my already low expectations when you do not even have candy or milkshakes during the movie. 

2. If you're going to offer fandango per purchase tickets you should probably have a machine to process them like other theaters as the wait defeats the purpose of pre purchasing. 

The theater, the seats and the location are great. Just offer what you advertise and everything will fall under 5 starts pretty quickly."}
{"text":"We went to see Finding Dory on a saturday night. There were barely any people in the theater which was nice. The service was prompt and the food was decent. We had the blue chz/buffalo burger and chz pizza with fries. The soft drinks are $4 a pop though so thats a little steep but overall we really enjoyed the experience. The commercials are loud but I hope this encourages people to visit the Arboretum Cinebarre cause' it was enjoyable for us."}
{"text":"We saw Independence Day Resurgence here and were unimpressed. It was warm in theatre, hot in the lobby and sweltering in the bathroom. The floors were so sticky, I actually walked out of my sandal. 

The chairs don't recline here and the way the tables are set up in front of the seats, there's no where to prop your feet up. I felt fidgety the entire time. 

Some pros... The table service is a nice touch (although a little distracting once the movie starts), the beer selection is decent and the french fries were good. All in all, I'm going to stick with my \"home\" theatre on Monroe Road from here on out..."}
{"text":"Opening weekend for Black Panther and the service is worse than it's ever been. No servers, no one taking tickets, I literally walked right in and sat down and didn't show my ticket to anyone. No one taking orders for food. Opening weekend for Beauty & The Beast was top notch service. So yeah...today is NOT the typical service for this place. Makes you wonder what the motive is. Highly disappointing and I will definitely let everyone know."}
{"text":"I used to like Cinebarre but they seem to be stuck in a downward spiral. Service is sorely unapproachable and even rude at times. The food is not worth it. Used to love their burgers but they are so greasy and gross now that I can't stand it. The drinks are the only redeeming part of the Cinebarre experience anymore. We even tried to see a movie one afternoon and the movie didn't work. We're promised they would show it at 3:30, and it didn't work a second time. Ended up spending 4 hours there playing pool and waiting for a movie that we never even saw. But the management did give several return passes and free appetizer coupons. 

I do hope Cinebarre pulls out of this rut they have been in. I love the location and want to love it but it just keeps disappointing... C'mon guys!"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved it. Very comfortable recliners, with trays that swing in front of you to put food and drink on. They bring the food to the theater after you order upfront. I would give it a five if it  weren't for the fact that on the way out, we saw a waiter eating someone's food as he was taking it to deliver to the diner. I'm know, It's hard to believe."}
{"text":"I think I like the concept of Cinebarre more-so than the execution.  Granted I remember going to the Arboretum Theater before it changed hands so the place has definitely transformed.  We were trying to catch a movie on Saturday evening so it was pretty crowded and we got there without much time to experience the bar area.

Just ordering a milkshake for my one \"let's see how this goes\" went ok.  My order sat up on the counter/table for a while, but the nice girl got to it and it came out relatively in good time.  

I'm not a big fan of how the table and seats are oriented, you almost have to get up out of your chair to reach something or put your drink down (it was a little awkward).  The epicenter theater has me spoiled with their swivel tables.

Overall, it wasn't a bad experience.  I just would not have gone out of my way to see a movie here like I would see one downtown."}
{"text":"Seating in the theatre was good with plenty of room so the servers didn't become a distraction during the movie.  I had the kiddie hotdog w/fries & it was ok but is difficult to dress when the lights are down) & the Princess Leia cinnamon rolls!  I loved the cinnamon rolls, but eat them right away because they get a little tough after the cool down.

This is a great venue & I look forward to going again!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times before, and have enjoyed the movies and food.  However,...

It's Sunday night and my wife, two friends and I am looking forward to seeing the new movie Edge of Tomorrow, a Tom Cruise film, at 7:35.  We get there and order drinks, and start to enjoy some previews.  Though, we all notice that the lower half of the screen is a bit out of focus.  It almost seemed as if the lower half was in 3D.  So, we mention this to our nice server, and she goes to tell the manager.  

Just as the movie starts we see an adjustment to the focus, and it seems better.  However, now just the lower 20% of the screen is still out of focus.  It also seems to not be so greatly focused on any quick motions, which this film has a lot, as it's a high-action film.  So, we mention it to our server again, and she says she'll take care of it. 

Well, we finished the movie, with the lower 20% out of focus, and the bad focus on high-action scenes.  On our way out we don't see a manager, so I tell the only server I see at the moment.  We tell her that the film seemed out of focus, and she says, \"was it theater 7?\"  Funny she asked that, as it was.  She continues to let us know its been a continual issue with that theater, as its their 3D theater, and the management is trying to fix it.  Though, that doesn't help us, as we've seen it already.  Why let more people see a movie in that theater knowing there is an issue?  It amazes me that this continues going on.  The previews of this film on my home tv look 20 times better in quality than this theater 7.  It shouldn't be that different.  

More people will see a movie in this theater at regular cost, and will also be bothered by the quality.  That's, to me, a really poor management decision.  People buying tickets to a film in that theater should be told before they complete their purchase, to make a decision to see it or not, and also get a partial or full refund after they see the movie, as the quality is the worst I've ever seen on a movie screen.  And this includes Park Rd's movie theater.

The server was nice.  The food our friends had was good.  The film was great!  The quality of the theater was poor.  Really poor for $10.50 a person.  2 stars."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place and gave it a few tries but I won't be back again unless someone drags me here.  I actually like that its cold in the theater (aren't they all?) but what I don't like is how every time I'm stuck waiting for 10 minutes or longer after the movie is over for my check or card back.  In one experience they brought the wrong order and it took 30 minutes to flag someone down to explain the issue.  If your going to do this type of theater then hire enough people to handle big movies or offer limited service.  Seats are at least somewhat comfy."}
{"text":"Good experience at Cinebarre.  Been twice, the food is very good, prices are in one with any moderate priced restaurant.  At an AMC in Concord, I paid $20 for a lg popcorn and 2 sodas.  You'll pay less here and the popcorn is fresh and with real butter.  Pizza was good, nachos were awesome, so I'd definitely recommend if you want to snack while catching a flick.  Tuesday's are $5 ticket days so that is cool too!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Cinebarre for a Yelp Elite event a few months back and had been waiting for an opportunity to bring our son and my Mom there .  A rainy day on our vacation was the perfect opportunity!  

The theaters are decent size, the seats are pretty comfortable, and the service is good.  We did learn that it's best to get to the theater approx 20 minutes before the movie so drinks arrive before the movie begins.  We cut it close for the first show so we didn't any of our drinks or snacks until well after the movie began.  

Between the 4 of us, we sampled a handful of different items and we enjoyed them all!  The Popcorn is delicious!...we're talking \"real\" butter!   My Mom had the \"Chocolat\" (warm brownie with a small dish of ice cream), my Son had a Vanilla Shake (served in a classic Shake Glass with a straw AND a spoon) and the \"Goldfingers\" (Chicken fingers with fries...HUGE portion, BTW), my husband and I shared the \"Slideways\" (4 cheeseburger slides) and they were really excellent!  We both took a bite and looked at each other in amazement...who would have expected a movie theater to produce such well-seasoned juicy beef patties with caramelized onions on \"toasted\" buns.  We were blown away!  (I have no idea how we missed these at the Yelp event!)  The food is restuarant/bar food...NOT movie theater food so when you see the prices, please keep that in mind.  

In between movies, we played some pool to pass the time.  When not playing pool, we had some comfy couches to sit on...brilliant idea Cinebarre!   The overall decor is so much fun.  My teenage son really enjoyed looking at all of the \"old\" movie posters...Night of the Living Dead, Godfather, Ghostbusters, just to name a few.  They also play really good music in the bar/pool table/sitting areas.

My family had a really good day and we look forward to going back again!"}
{"text":"What can be bad about drinking beer and watching a movie?  I have had no service issue like others.  The service has been great and the food is good for a movie theater.  They have $6 minutes Monday-Thursday.  The seats are fine.  They may not be as comfortable as some other movie theaters, but did I mention, you can drink alcohol.  If you don't care about that, go somewhere else, but this serves a niche."}
{"text":"I really like the concept here and overall they do a great job making the movie experience  a bit more  special:

Vast food menu (though decidedly less refined than Mez). Think pizza, fried apps, desserts, burgers, snacks. The food was pretty tasty and they deliver to you quietly and efficiently throughout the movie. I found that the movie was not interrupted in the least by their presence. 

 Huge Perk- not having to get up and miss any of the movie (such is the case with Mez). Prices are decent, a soda and appetizer was $12. We did get our food before the drinks and it definitely took a good 20 minutes to get our food. We were not given refills on fountain drinks, so watch your salt intake  : ) 

Seats- Spacious and comfortable leather, a great view wherever you're seated. There is a small bar-like table in front of you though you may have to sit on the edge of your seat a bit to reach if you're a smaller individual or have a child with you.  

Tickets are very reasonable at $10...and they offer $5 Tuesday movie nights.

I will definitely return as I like that they bring the food to you and it's priced right."}
{"text":"Absolute worst experience ever at this theater. They have gone so far down hill it is sad. From the moment we bought our tickets it was horrible. The girl working the ticket sales desk was clearly under the influence as she couldn't seem to keep her eyes open and continued to mumble how she couldn't get our gift cards to work. Her eyes kept rolling around in her head. At one point, when asked what she said, she had no idea what she had said only seconds before...seriously crazy. The manager was finally called. A short, stout girl came to the front on her cell phone. Never once made eye contact or apologized for the employee who was clearly on pills. We still had to pay for one of the tickets in cash because the girl couldn't figure it out. But the gift cards worked fine inside...shocking. We ordered when we got into the theater, half the food never came. It was all on the bill though. We had to ask for it to be removed. Needless to say we will NEVER COME BACK TO THIS SAD EXCUSS OF A BUSINESS. Regal Entertainment should be embarrassed to own the establishment. Get off the drugs, get off the cell phones and please try to create a semi pleasurable experience for the people who still choose to watch movies at Cinebarre. Get high when you get off work and all is good with us. We are not hard to please I can assure you. Really wish we would have received AMC gift cards..oh well."}
{"text":"For many years, the dinner-and-a-movie experience did not go well, at least in Charlotte. Now it seems to be doing much better. Or at least better. Though the seats in Studio Movie Grille are way more comfortable, the service at Cinebarre is - on most viewings - a lot better.

The menu offerings are also better at Cinebarre, though even those have gone down since they opened, both in quality and quantity. What's worse is the drinks are priced closer to a move theater than a restaurant - yet they want you to think you are in a restaurant. It's a little odd, actually.

After attending a few movies, the best thing to do is generally to eat out front in the bar area, then go in and watch a movie with whatever leftovers you may have, so you can nibble through the movie. And unfortunately, you don't get refills - even on water. It's a shame, since the drinks can be a bit pricey. Understandable on alcohol, but for a rather expensive soft drink? It would be a nice touch.

The theaters themselves are also hit or miss. The larger ones (with mostly stadium seating) are solid. The smaller ones are pretty bad, since they had to rip out half the rows. Definitely go for newer movies, as older ones can get a little dicey.

Also available are television premieres, such as The Walking Dead and even some events like football - those can be free (of course, the food isn't). Those are more interesting, so you might want to check them out."}
{"text":"waitstaff in bar was not as great as the one in the theatre.  she was terrific!  food was ok, not fabulous but ok.  probably wouldn't eat dinner there again but maybe the popcorn which is served in a bowl (not a typical popcorn bowl, but a metal bowl).  wine and beer selection is good (no liquor here).  be careful about keeping your drinks on the table while you are eating.  unfortunately i knocked mine over from the chair drink holder and made a mess.  the waitress brought me another without charging which was very nice."}
{"text":"There's no better way to enjoy a movie.  Seriously!  You can get popcorn too but why not enjoy an entire meal and really feast during the movie.  If you've never been, Cinebarre is a hybrid movie theatre and restaurant.  The seats are stadium-style traditional high-back movie seats and there is a small bar-like table.  

While Cinebarre is billed as a movie theatre for adults (since you can get alcohol too), it's not a bad place to enjoy a matinee with the kiddos."}
{"text":"Initial impression upon walking in -- Neat. 

I've been to theaters similar to this on the West Coast and I really miss having beer and food delivered to me at my seat. Its such a novelty. 

Came here on a Thursday afternoon and it was pretty empty, which I was pleased to see because there is just something about having a whole theater to yourself that is fun.  

I ordered the grilled cheese & tomato soup. It was alright, but definitely not worth the 11.50 plus the two extra dollars for bacon. It came to me luke warm and then I had to wait on them to make the tomato soup which also came to me luke warm. The tomato soup tasted like straight up marinara sauce. My sister ordered a pizza and she said it was pretty good and seemed to enjoy it. 

The girl came half way during the movie with the bill, which we found kinda odd. Kinda hard to see what I'm paying for in the dark. Wasn't really ready to pay for that until the end of the movie, but whatever. 

I think I will be back next time I am in the Charlotte area. Its not an ever day thing for sure because of how expensive it is, but it is something different to do every now and then."}
{"text":"I'd been wanting to try Cinebarre for awhile, so my husband and I were excited when the living social deal was posted a couple of weeks ago.  We arrived about 7:05 for a 7:15 movie.  Our server greeted us quickly and explained the process.  She took our appetizer order and we settled in for the show.  

It took 35 minutes for our appetizer to arrive...and it was kind of cold.  Our order had been \"in the rack\" for someone to pick it up since about 7:15, but the person who delivered our appetizer didn't take it.  Finally, at 7:50, I headed out to find our server and ran into her just outside the theater -- she apologized and said she'd been tied up in another theater.  

Sometime between 7:50 and 8:35, when our dinner finally arrived, our server stopped by and said that our food would be out soon.  However, before the food arrived, our server dropped off the check!!!  She'd explained at the beginning that it was their policy to collect payment before the movie was over, but I felt like she could've held the check a few minutes until our food arrived.  She did not pick up the payment, but did drop it back off.

My husband and I both got burgers, which were delicious -- but the service was so terrible, I don't know that we'll go back.  She seemed kind of irritated that we had a living social, but we still had good tip money!"}
{"text":"Normally we go to Regal Stonecrest but the theater was sold out for the new Star  Wars movie so we decided to check out Cinebarre.  The movie started at 11:30 but we arrive around 10:40 to get good seats.  We quickly scanned the menu and hit the button for service but no one ever came.  Eventually my daughter went to the lobby to see if she could place her order but they don't do that and you have to wait for the server.  By now the theater is getting full and more people have hit their lights for service.  Now it's 11:30 the previews are starting and finally  several servers have shown up.   But now the theater is full. Everyone wants to place an order and there is no priority of who the server gets to.  the movie now starts, and the server finally approaches. so I have to twist my body to read the opening as the server takes our order and processes a payment.  It's very distracting having servers walk back and forth thru the entire movie. While the concept of a meal with your movie is a good idea.  Cinnebarre can not execute it properly.  I will never go back to this theater!"}
{"text":"I hate to be the debbie downer here but this place truly stinks. We went for dinner & a movie. I live near Carolina Cinemas in Matthews so I guess I've been spoiled lately? We walked in and it smelled like a mixture of sour beer, moldy washcloths and a splash of fresh vomit. I couldn't understand why no one else was gagging. Once we made it into the theater it wasn't quite as over powering or maybe I was desensitized. 

The menu is limited and the seats are okay. But everything felt kinda sticky - and that along with the stench was enough to put me off of this theater for a very long time. 

Full disclosure: I did eat food here too (I can't believe it either). It was okay, and they have a large beer/wine selection."}
{"text":"Cinebarre reminds me of what royalty probably experienced back in the day. The commoners would go to the \"regular\" theater for their version of entertainment.... because you know, they all had movie theaters back then. 

While the normal folk go to their regular movie, the royal crowd goes to the theater AND had dinner served to them... I mean how much more special can you feel at a place???

So, In case you haven't guessed it by now, Cinebarre is NOT your typical theater. Now it's a bit pricey but I'll pay it all day long for the service and menu that they offer here. YES, MENU!!! Not feeling like checking out the latest movie, no prob, they have you covered. This place has a bar, pool tables and a juke box in the lobby. 

Contrary to what you may believe, the food is actually REALLY good! I figured when I came here awhile ago for a Yelp event that it would be OK food, but man they fooled me. WOW. I would seriously come here just for dinner if it were closer. 

When you go into your theater and get comfy, there is a little shelf type table in front of you with a pencil and a menu. You go over your food and drink selection with a server who comes and checks on you throughout the movie!!! Not only can you order the norm, you can also order alcohol. 

I love the place aesthetically speaking too. When you walk in, huge movie posters from the past grace the walls, and take you back to your younger days. We were met with a nice surprise as well, not only do they have those posters, they also offer a throwback for the nostalgic and whimsical folks like myself on the first Friday of every month... The Rocky Horror Picture Show!! They have actors that even act the movie out while it's playing. We didn't get to go this time, but the first Friday in March, it's a date!!! 

I really have nothing bad to say about this place. It's such a cool concept, and I don't know why someone didn't implement it sooner. The only thing I wish, is that it were a bit closer to home. I'm so selfish. :)"}
{"text":"This is the kind of novelty we need in CLT! This emerging chain has the coolest concept - a movie theatre with a bar in the lobby and a restaurant that delivers at your seat during the movie. What's not to love?

The bar/lobby is expansive with a stylish mix of brushed stainless steel and black leather, offering plenty of places to hang out. The over-sized vintage-looking movie posters are absolutely incredible and add a fun flair. The bar has several great offerings and prices are on-par with other area establishments. You can order from the bar during the movie, too!

Every few rows of seats in each theatre has been removed to make room for a diner-bar-style arrangement with menus and order pads. How it works: you write the order ticket and leave it in the metal bar sticking up so the servers can see it during the show. Order food and drinks this way; they come around, scan the bar code for your seat and key everything in on a wireless device. When ready, they deliver! By removing every so many rows, they can come and go without disrupting the others. The crew is really nice and on top of things - great service all the way around. How awesome!

The food you have to choose from (with clever movie title names) is pretty darn awesome. Sandwiches, burgers, pizza, and customary bar-type apps (wings, fries, etc). Great tasting and perfect flick food.

Dinner and movie was never more fun!"}
{"text":"I've probably been to Cinebarre forty or fifty times since it opened so this is a review of my experiences overall.

If there were one thing I could change about Cinebarre is I wish anyone under the age of 21 was banned from the premises period, but that's not going to happen. There are frequently adults with kids especially on the weekend when every-other-weekend dads take their kids to see terribly age-inappropriate movies.  The other problem is when there is a kids' movie that causes the kitchen to get backed-up.

Cinebarre does NOT have reserved seating. I find this to be a POSITIVE thing. I have been to a number of the reserved seating movie theaters around my problem with the practice is it gives people a license to be late. People figure \"hey, I am guaranteed the seat of my choice so I can walk in whenever the hell I want, even if it is 10 minutes after the movie has started which is 25 minutes after the published start time thanks to previews, and crawl over and disturb the people who were on time.\"

So on that note, we always get there 45 minutes before the published show time... really. Now you might be thinking that's a pain, but you need to remember the food factor.
Part of the problem with eating at the movies is of course you're in the dark.  If you get there 45 minutes early and order right away, chances are you'll be done eating by the time the lights go out.

Also, we never go on Friday or Saturday night, especially to see a brand-new movie.  Too many people. Kitchen too backed up. Too many people getting there late. YES I am going to sigh and roll my eyes at you if you arrive ten minutes after the published start time and want to crawl over me. When you say to me \"this isn't your living room well guess what, it's NOT YOUR EITHER! Get here on time!\"

Food. I like their pizza. I've not tried much else. My wife seems to like their chicken fingers, potato skins, etc. I know a lot of people like that they bring the popcorn in big stainless steel bowls, but those things make a lot of racket when they hit the floor.

We used to like to go in the morning on the weekend, but they stopped their breakfast menu.

If you have a problem with food, service, etc. talk politely to a manager. When there has a been a problem, the managers have always taken care of it.

Over all, it is our first choice for the movies, but yes by the time you've bought your tickets, food, and drinks, it's $50."}
{"text":"We have visited Cinebarre once and had dinner while viewing.  We're vegetarians and luckily were able to find a baked potato and salad we could share.  Beer prices weren't horrible. The really odd thing is the lack of light by which you're able to order - yes, I realize it's a theater, and like another reviewer said: come early so you can order with some semblance of light.  The theater was not very clean and it does not appear they wipe down after each viewing.  I would recommend you save your clams and eat at an actual restaurant instead of here.  We may try visiting again with a BOGO coupon but we will not pay full price for this theater.  I agree with the majority of other reviewers: in theory this theater might work but it does not in practice.  They get two stars for a relatively diverse menu and comfortable seats."}
{"text":"NEW UPDATE:  taking the star back away.  Paying $40 for two burgers, fries, and sodas just sucks.  The food is below average, and always overcooked.  Add $15 for two tickets, and it's $60 for lunch and a movie.
They definitely give you the movie theater experience - everything is overpriced.


UPDATE - Adding a star, as I have been back twice since the last review.  Both times were very good.  Appetizer beat the main course to my seat, food was hot, tasted great, etc.  I'm glad we have a theater with a menu nearby; I'll keep visiting this place.


I have been there twice.  The first time was great; food was good, the ambiance is excellent, and the overall experience was very positive.  I went today for the second time.  This time, I was in a much larger theater.  My appetizer and main course showed up at the same time, it took them forever to bring my drink out, and the food was lukewarm upon arrival.  My burger was mediocre, the service was awful, and I was unhappy with the whole deal.
I'll probably give this place one more chance, just to see if today was the exception or the rule.  Until then, they get two stars."}
{"text":"On an evening I had a ticket to a movie, I arrived 15 minutes prior to the start time. There was no one to direct me to the correct theater, and when I finally guessed at which one it was, I was told it was sold out.

Because this is the Arboretum, this is near nowhere and took 25 minutes to drive to. 

As a consolation, the theatre gave me a voucher for a free drink, which was nice. What was not nice was the 20 minutes I waited before anyone at the bar even acknowledged me. The two stars instead of one is only because I did, indeed, get a lukewarm glass of house wine in a soda glass. 

The theatre is a relic that needs to be banished into the minds of history. 

There are enough places to go watch a movie in Charlotte that are far superior. Your living room, for example."}
{"text":"Nothing wrong with the movie and/or seating.  They need to get out of the food and beverage business!  Ordered 2 adult beverages before the movie.  Never delivered but the credit card was run even after being assured by the manager that it would not be transacted.  Called 2 days later to discuss with the manager.  Put on hold for over 10 minutes and finally hung up.  Horrible service experience ruined a good afternoon movie experience."}
{"text":"Went to see a private showing scheduled to begin at 730. At 745 an announcement was made that due to technical difficulties it would be an hour before it began. 
I got passes for another night, but as thus theater is 30 miles from my house, highly unlikely that I will use. 
I see prior reviews that cite technical issues. Maybe it's time to get the equipment back up to par."}
{"text":"Headed to Cinnebarre for the first this evening to watch a movie with my book club. I was very disappointed in the layout. I am on the shorter side (5'3\") and the counter in front of our seats was too tall by about 5 inches. I had to stretch up to see the bottom of the movie screen. It was also very cold, although I was wearing a sweater, and had to wear my coat the entire time. We did not order food so I cannot comment on the service or quality. I prefer to watch my movies with an un-obstructed view."}
{"text":"I'm glad to see I'm not alone in my bad experiences here. I've given this place two chances, but the bartenders have ruined it for me. 

Both times I came in, sat at the bar, and waited for a good 8-10 minutes without being acknowledged. It wasn't busy either time and there were multiple bartenders working. Once I had to move to right in front of a bartender before she asked me what I wanted. The other time I had to flag one down and ask if I could order.

On top of that, the bartenders were rude and insulting. The experience that stood out the most was when I stood up after receiving my drink to walk over to the lounge area and sit on a couch instead of at the bar, and the bartender asked if I was leaving. She wanted to make sure I knew the drink wasn't \"to go.\"

Yep, pretty sure I know I can't take my alcoholic beverage out onto the streets. Thanks for the insult to my intelligence, though. 

To top it off, the counters in the theater are way too high. As someone else said, they're difficult to see over unless you're sitting in one of the first few rows. 

I've been to other theaters that execute the same concept with friendlier service and a much better menu. (If I'm spending a lot on food, I don't want a chicken sandwich or a side of fries. How about some more creative menu options?)

I'll stick to places like AMC's Fork and Screen. Here's hoping they open one in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Went with my sons to see the Hobbit. Cinebarre has a nice bar area and there were a few folks hanging out having drinks while waiting for the show. I would like it a little better if they put a couple of small lights on the bar in the theater so you can see to pay your bill during the movie. Nice place, with a good menu. The food is pretty pricey though (10.50 for 5 potato skins and 10.00 for a milkshake) bit what do you expect at a movie theater. Popcorn is a good choice at about 6.00 for a big bowl with REAL BUTTER!!
We ha e been several times and will definitely go again. By far the best way to see a movie in Charlotte!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went with another couple to see the movie Sully yesterday.  The staff was polite, professional, and the movie was great.  I would have given 5 stars, but the kitchen was apparently overwhelmed and our food never came out.  The server apologized profusely, and it had not been my experience on previous occasions, so we just enjoyed the popcorn, beer and a movie.  I also miss the reclining chairs of the other places that serve food in the theater, and the others also let you pick from the available seating, rather than trying to find seats on your own."}
{"text":"Honestly, the only good thing about this movie theater tonight was the movie \"Joy,\" which I would absolutely recommend.

First of all, the theater is overpriced. We spent $50 on two sandwiches, two drinks, and a brownie. Second of all, the bar is too far from the chairs, and, in order to eat over it, I had to scoot to the very edge of the chair which was pretty uncomfortable. All that being said, had everything else been okay, I wouldn't give this theater a one star. Unfortunately, everything else was NOT okay.

We arrived early to see the movie at 7:30 PM, sitting down at about 7:15 PM. Right off of the bat, the movie was fairly difficult to hear (low volume). We ordered two sandwiches with queso for fries, and a brownie to split for dessert at 7:30 PM (we were hungry!), as well as two drinks (this all took place during the previews, though the wait staff are supposed to make their rounds well before the movie start time).

We got our drinks shortly after ordering. That was good. And, at about 7:45 PM, our order came! Except--it was our brownie and ice cream. No sandwiches. So then we asked the waitress, \"hey, where are our sandwiches?\" and she assured us that she would go check on them. Here starts the waiting game. 8:15 PM rolls around--no sandwiches. We turn on that fancy red light to alert a staff member. 8:45 PM comes and goes, and finally a waiter runs up to our table (it took 30 minutes for someone to even respond to our alert). He hurriedly runs away and brings back our two sandwiches. They were super cold and kind of gross. By this time our ice cream is just water and the brownies are cold.

Now I'm home and I have a stomach ache. Never ever going back."}
{"text":"Not my favorite place for a movie, lots of different small screening rooms that a waitress comes around and serves  food and beverages. I thought it was a little dirty.

Food is adequate and a little overpriced - you can just go in the lobby and drink at the bar and shoot pool if you choose.

Casual dress, large Aboretum shopping mall surrounds the theater with that huge parking lot."}
{"text":"Hello Friends,

Now I coulda sworn I've written a review once I left here way back when!!! No worries!!

Nice setup. 
Bar at the entrance where you may purchase tickets, drinks, & food (which is pretty freakin good considering. A few pool tables. 

Imagin seatin at any movie, add about a foot & 1/2 of leg room. That's where you eat. No worries. When your done and want to sit back it doesn't block your view. Kinda like Bubba Gump or you run of the mill Brazilian restaurant where you inform someone you would like service by placing your order sheet out in the open!!

Pretty cool. Mother & Child days are on Tuesdays (all movies 5 snaps). Just in case you are thinking like I did, can I come even if I'm not 1 a mother 2 no child!! Answer. YES!!

I noticed they show NFL games in Sundays. Wow. Great idea. Had I not already had my NFL Ticket to see my Tampa Bay Buccaneers, I woulda checked that out. Maybe next!!

{"text":"We frequent this cinnebarre for the convenience factor and concept.  The food typically is 4 star, what happened yesterday needs to be corrected.. We orders out usual popcorn, which is freshly popped with real butter. As for food we tried something we have never tried. Grilled cheese, which is accompanied with Annie's tomato soup. We liked that idea instead of fries and planned on sharing. The sandwich itself for $11 was cold and the soup.. Uh it was more like chunky luke warm tomato paste. I'm not sure what happened but we told waitress it wasn't we were expecting. So we just ordered side of fries... They were hot when brought out and crispy! I always order the splash, it's my favorite drink. It's a nice size glass of sangria that is always consistent! The drinks and most items on menu are, but there are a few you need to watch out for.. I wish they would get better about majority of food items on the menu since this is their concept! Really should of rated it 2 stars as there were only 6 other people in the theatre on a Tuesday. Personally unacceptable to have had to wait 15 mins after movie started for her to come back and place our order, I don't know why she was SO busy. I guess the other theaters.. But this is where they need more servers.. My sandwich shouldn't of been cold and really who the heck hasn't tasted that soup in the kitchen.. Good grief. Try this place, it is truly an awesome experience when everything is done the right and on time way! Management needs to get in there and get to work with the staff. Hope it gets better..."}
{"text":"Horrible.  Seemed like they had plenty of staff, but no one looks up from the bar.   The place smelled terrible i assume from the filthy bathrooms.    It was a kids movie and it started almost 20 minutes late because they couldn't get the screen working.  A waitress finally arrives and complains about the other theatre that is sold out and they are busy.  seems annoyed at us because we want to order food.   So We order,  food arrives with about 10 minutes to go in the movie.    Had been before and had a great experience, but not going back again."}
{"text":"I love going during the week but this time I tried it on a date. I always rationalize my experience. This time I won't. We went to see an older movie about 6 weeks therefore it was a smaller venue. The room was completely filthy, there was 5 of us couples standing around waiting to sit down. I had to go get management. It tool 5 mins for her to chorale enough employees to come clean the room and wipe down the tables. After that the previews were almost finished and no one came to get our drink orders untill the movie was 15 mins in. I had to yet again physically find an employee for that too. Our food came in room temp with old stale fries; not once did they come refill our drinks... 

Oh and my date was home on military leave and hadn't been in clt  since 2010. He was not impressed. Way to go guys..."}
{"text":"Went to CineBarre to watch Star Wars: the Force Awakens in 3D scheduled for 6:40 pm. Walked in as a first timer after paying for tickets online. Ticket windows and customer service kiosks were empty so there was no one to check my QR code ticket (and they were never checked) or ask which theatre I needed to find. After finally finding the theatre with no help of the ample yet unapproaching staff, I found my place in line.

6:40 came and went and the Russian cartoons about bus stops, dance moves, ant Hills, and robots with magnifying glasses continued to play as the previews... I consider myself inclusive, it was just odd, different than any other pre-movie entertainment I've seen.  Approaching 7pm, the waitress finally came to take our order and offered no indication of moving start time or update. 

Now half an hour past the stated start time, I'm getting some great commercials.on Charleston, SC at a painfully high volume, and the actual previews begin! Whoo hooo!

Enjoyed the movie, and never received 3D glasses and saw no one else with them...assuming it was just a standard film sold as 3D online. Disappointing. 

For what it's worth, the service was pretty fast and reliable for food and drink in the theatre. 

This is my first and last time in this venue. Will recommend other options to friends and family unless they're really into Russian cartoons."}
{"text":"GREAT CONCEPT. Poorly executed. I wanted to see a few different movies and have multiple experiences before I wrote this. 

For starters the ticket prices are a steal! BUT they make their money from their food and drink sales. The service is VERY slow, I mean 47minutes for a hamburger and cold fries slow. And then there was cheese on it that I didn't order (and cheese costs extra too). The burger wasn't good, McDonalds quality. Then I never got my popcorn that I ordered. Then after all of that my bill was just completely wrong so it took another 20 minutes to track down my server and get it corrected. They did give me a voucher for a free movie ticket but again, they make their money from food sales. 

Also two of the three screens for the movies either had a line through it or a yellow splotch.

Skip the concept. Just go to Stonecrest and have a typical movie experience! Plus their popcorn is better!"}
{"text":"Don't get the potato skins... They are dry and disappointing. Good popcorn with real butter is nice though! I prefer epicenter...but this is convinient to those who live in the Providence area."}
{"text":"\"Vincent: But you know what the funniest thing about Europe is?
Jules: What?

I'm telling you, I must be in Europe because I'm drinking beer out of a frosty glass in a movie theater! Cinebarre (located in the old Arboretum movie theater) is the new \"it\" place for catching a movie and getting your grub & drink on! I got a chance to check out this place the other day. Cool setup! When you enter the lobby you're greeted with a huge U shaped bar. They've got a small stage for musical acts & even a couple of pool tables. The theater is set up with nice, plush chairs & a long, thin table that runs the length of the each row for your food & drinks. The waiters will wait on you throughout the movie. Great pizza, beer, & the brownies were fantastic! They offer a full menu. The staff is friendly and helpful. Looking forward to catching a few more flix here!"}
{"text":"Some say \"If you can't say something nice don't say anything at all\". So with that in mind I will say that this movie theater successfully played a movie...OH! aaaannnd they serve booze to hopefully get you drunk enough to not notice how terrible the food is.

I guess I can't end my review like that so let me expand.

From the moment we arrived at the theater and tried to park I was already not loving it...at least 10 spots were wasted due to fools that felt that they were entitled to 2 parking spaces for their vehicle. This isn't the establishments fault however, merely that of their clientele. Next we walk in and have absolutely no idea where to go or who to show our prepaid tickets to. So we are wandering around trying to find the theater that our movie is in and finally an employee notices us and instead of checking our tickets yelled to us that it was in auditorium #4. Guess we didn't need to pre-purchase our tickets or purchase them at all. 

Now on to the food....oh the food. We ordered rosemary and truffle oil popcorn ($9) and yes it came out in a silver metal bowl like when you make popcorn at home. But unlike the popcorn I make at home this had absolutely ZERO flavor. Not a trace of rosemary nor truffle oil let alone any salt whatsoever. It merely tasted like popcorn straight out of the air popper. The word \"styrofoam\" came to mind. The way ordering is set up in this place doesn't really make it easy to let someone know if something is not right. Regardless, it was enough popcorn to equal a small popcorn at any other theater with no flavor at all and they had the nerve to charge $9 for it. Silly. THEN my friend passed down and offered me some pizza. After taking a bite I can see why she was attempting to pawn off an almost entirely whole pizza to the people around her. It was practically inedible. Mediocre dough doused in a bottled bbq sauce, burnt veggies and something only slightly resembling chicken.

Let me put it this way...contrary to the fact that I hadn't eaten all day and was STARVING I wasn't even desperate enough to eat any of the overpriced bland popcorn or the mess this place tried to pass off as pizza. 

I just gave 2 stars because the employees weren't jerks and now I know that if I come back here I might not even have to pay the $11 for the movie ticket. I just have to remember to pack my own snacks in my purse next time."}
{"text":"Worst service known to man kind. Understaffed on a weekend with a premier movie out isn't great business sense.  Even if they gave it away I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Woohoo! I had a good time!

I refuse to back off of that 5th star just because I was a guest of Yelp's....

The food is really good, and exactly appropriate for things you'll need to eat in the dark and without a table. Well priced, too, when compared to what traditional theaters charge for snacks... and this is real food. I had to take home a box.

The seats are really comfy, Leather and clean and far enough from the little table/counter that you don't feel obligated to eat or drink. But you'll want to anyway. 

The staff is courteous and the service excellent. I'll be a regular, I'm ok with that."}
{"text":"It's been a few days since my trip to Cinebarre and I have almost come down from my high... This place is beyond... 

Upon entering, there's an open space with pool tables on each side and a bar in the middle... The bar shows random silent movies on a television in the middle, which I thought was kinda cool... I ended up seeing something called Queen Kelly... Definitely weird, but pretty funny... I'm not sure if it was supposed to be, though... lol  There's also a jukebox (is that still what they're called now?) opposite the bar with all the latest jams...

The food?  Good gracious, I think I wanted to order everything! The items on the menu have really funny movie themed names which I enjoyed because I'm just a dork like that... A couple of the guys next to me got the wings and I was kind of sad I didn't... But hey, that's what repeat visits are for... I got the potato skins and they were some of the best I've had... The skins were properly oiled and salted, the insides were fluffy and the toppings were plentiful... The only reason I didn't finish them there is because I wanted to make room for the popcorn... Okay, the popcorn... You know how people say this particular item is just like mama used to make?  This popcorn is just like my mama used to make... And I'm not kidding... It's real butter, guys and dolls...  Not that yellow stuff we've become accustomed to at movies nowadays... Completely changes the flavor in a magical way...  The popcorn is seasoned without being incredibly salty and comes in a stainless steel bowl (which prevents that loud ass crinkling noise that comes with the paper bags)... Now, I'm not sure if it's unlimited because I was rolling solo that night, so I didn't eat the whole bowl, but it's worth an ask!

Now the setup... This is ultimately awesome, but it has some drawbacks... Between the rows of seating are actual lowered aisles where the servers can walk upright without blocking your view instead of crouching down to walk and/or take your order... That's got to make it so much easier for them and the viewers... The seats themselves are different than Studio Movie Grill... Instead of having the little tray top table that swivels around to your lap, there's a long table in front of the entire row...  My favorite part is the personal roll of paper towels hanging beneath for your convenience... No more asking for extra napkins or having to brush your hands off because your server's taking a while... The ordering process rawks! You check out the menu from the table, write down what you want on one of the white sheets provided and slip it into the holder... The server comes to pick it up and take it away... Then they bring back what you ordered... There you go!  It's that simple... The only thing that bugged me a little is that the table's so far away, you kind of have to sit on the edge of the chair to reach... I guess only if you're short like me, maybe...  lol  

I loved this place and I will soooooo be heading back there again...  

Bonus:  They show The Walking Dead on Sundays for free!  I didn't find this out until the end of the season, though... I am all up in there for next season's premiere, though..."}
{"text":"I go to the movies often enough to have a favorite theatre and this is my go to spot! The theatre is clean and the food is pretty good and competitive price wise with others in the area. I also like the fact that I can also enjoy lunch or dinner with my movie that is probably my favorite part of this theatre experience! Staff is friendly and professional"}
{"text":"Nice and clean. Comfortable seats with the option to dine-in while watching your movie, just press the button and your waiter will serve you. I suppose it's a pretty novel idea. The only downside is you can't prop your feet up on anything and the chairs don't have a recliner option for your feet. The bar out front is fully stocked and there is a nice lounge reception area complete with a pool table. Matinee showings are $6.22 with tax included in the ticket price. One thing I wish this theater and other theaters in the area offered was midnight showings on opening night. I have not found a single theater that does that in Charlotte. However, this theater is a solid choice. The staff are friendly, parking unlimited, safe area, etc."}
{"text":"Not a fan.  First time here.  Didn't know it's a restaurant/bar with a movie theatre.  If you like people walking in front of you, ordering and delivering food, while you're trying to watch the movie, annoying, then this is the place for you.

Last time I'll come here-I wanted to leave."}
{"text":"I see they now check bags, which is odd. Never seen that in a theater before and believe me I have been to a lot of theaters all over the world. 
 So don't bring your bags ladies or be prepared to open them up. However, it's just's a quick peek, nothing to serious, but still."}
{"text":"Save yourself from spending way to much money. This place is horrible. We came to a movie and expected good service but that didn't happen. We ordered right at previews and did not receive our food until the end of the movie. The price for what we ordered was ridiculous. A pretzel, chicken fingers, two children pizzas, lemonade, Sprite, sweet tea and a water-$53! Never again!"}
{"text":"Needs to be more like the place in the epicenter. Hate how you have to write your order on a dry erase board. The movie we saw was in a theater with 2 rows so we were starring straight up which isn't fun for your neck or easy to eat."}
{"text":"This was my first time back since the Yelp Event about a year ago, and although we enjoyed ourselves I don't know if we're in any hurry to return.

Even though they set you up with a bar feel when you walk in, looking at some of the prices you quickly remember you're in a movie theater (that's still \"working on\" the liquor license). We were the only two at the bar, so I drank my over priced wine and eventually ordered a $5 box of candy for the movie (how could you not?). 

At about ten til the movie was supposed to start we figured we'd move into the theater, but they were still cleaning it. So we waited til after the showtime started to go in. Not a huge deal, we were in a fairly tiny (under 50 person) theater for a movie that had been out for quite some time, but I was unimpressed by the \"cleaning\". I'm not sure if the fries they left on the floor two seats over from me were there to tempt me in to ordering some, but it definitely kept me in a seat closer to the door. We didn't have any paper towels, it just reeked of stale food and many things were sticky... it kind of threw me back to those days in the freshman dorm. 

We opted not to eat anything but our candy and enjoyed the movie, I have to say the server for our theater was great. I saw people order food at the beginning and noticed their empty plates at the end but never saw her bring the food or anything else. 

The staff was pleasant, and I think it's great that they show breaking bad and panthers games for free on a huge screen... but getting to have a pizza and a beer while watching a movie here still doesn't put this theater above the ones I usually go to. I'm glad it's still an option though."}
{"text":"Not an ideal place for good food, nor is it an ideal place to watch a feature film - so why not slap em both together, charge a premium, and overfill the theaters with patrons - brilliant!

I will say that there is a possibility the movie we saw, Dark Knight Rises which has been out for a while, may have been relegated to their \"on-the-way-out\" theater, but the accommodations were quite cramped.  

That said, the experience is pretty cool, and if you've never been to a dinner theater, it's a good time.  

I'll also give a shout out to the staff.  While paying for our food and drinks at the end of the movie, I accidentally dropped $40 in cash (two $20's) onto the floor.  It was dark, I didn't see, blah blah.  I noticed the blunder on the way home, and after I cooled off from cussing my own name repeatedly, called Cinebarre in a desperate hope that the waiter had a good heart.

Well to her, and the credit of all the staff, she did.  She turned it in, and I was able to go back that night and pick it up.  I was so grateful, I came back the next day and gave her a fat tip and a thank you note.  It really was a nice feeling to know some people are still good in this world!"}
{"text":"You want to eat and drink while you watch a movie? Yep, they do that here.

There's no central concession stand, per se. They have a bar. And a few pool tables. And some places to eat in the lobby area. Or you can just go to your (reserved) seat in the movie theatre, press a button and a waiter/waitress comes to take your order.

The menu has interesting and humorous movie-themed items listed. \"Dial M for Mozzarella\" mozzarella sticks. \"Pretzels at Tiffany's\" pretzel sticks. \"Pickler on the roof\" fried pickles. \"The girl with the bacon tattoo\" potato skins. I think you get the idea. Prices seem to be about the same that you'd pay in a restaurant. The popcorn is bottomless.

More than 25 minutes of previews and coming attractions, during which they kept the lights on. I guess so people can see what they're eating? Once the lights went down, the quality of the movie and the sound was very good. Comfy seats with adjustable armrests. I enjoyed the movie."}
{"text":"We came here for  a screening last night, and it was kind of a disaster. We arrived an hour early because I had a feeling it would be packed..and I was right. There was a crowd surrounding the bar when we got there. I went straight for the ticket counter of course... don't want to get turned away because there are no seats when you get there so early. I glanced at the menu and thought ok, I'll just order in the theater (the Italian sodas caught my eye), I was glad it was one of those order and dine in theaters. 

But, after 25 minutes of waiting we were told that we must push the button before 7:30p to order anything from the seats. Not a problem, the order button was pushed but after 20 minutes of waiting... we were then told that there was only ONE SERVER assigned to the entire theater for a screening. That's just plain silly, why would you do that? You already aren't charging for the tickets since its a screening.. We were told to just go to the bar and order all drinks and food since the one server couldn't take on a full theater. Since the movie was so close to starting, we didn't bother, the lines were huge by the time we made it out. 

Then we waited and waited..15 minutes go by after the official screening start time and still no movie. Keep in mind, these screenings are pretty strict and they have always started promptly at the time listed on the passes. It took another 20 minutes of technical difficulties before the movie actually started with sound. In the end, it was still very unfocused and imbalanced. 

Maybe it was Cinebarre's first time holding a screening? If not, it seemed like it. I may be back for a regular outing if ever in the area again..so that's basically never. That's a shame, the menu actually did seem good."}
{"text":"I have been to this theater twice, and both times wasn't very pleasant! The food selection wasn't appetizing, I felt it was catering mostly to children. Food is served during the movie which was a little distracting, but the waitress do duck their heads down when moving in front of you. The most irritating thing (hence the one star rating,) was the lights that stay on during the whole movie!!! They do dim it a little, but it is still very visible and distracting! From now on I will go out of my way to see movies because this theater was disappointing."}
{"text":"This place has great potential but needs a lot of work to turn it around.  We ordered right away and the order was correct.  No issues there. Food wasn't the best but not bad either.  My pizza was good, mozzarella sticks were cold.  Husband ate one piece of his veggie pizza and didn't care for anymore.  Fairly clean.  Walls could use painting and carpet replaced.  Smell of years of spills in the theater.  Again so much potential for a great concept.  We would love to return to a fully renovated eat in theater."}
{"text":"We went to Cinnebarre on a Sunday afternoon to see a movie to switch things up a bit from our usual SMG experience. Unfortunately, we did not eat anything from the menu because we were not up for the selections they had. The price for the ticket was slightly more expensive than SMG, but that is due to the fact that SMG is always on Groupon and you can get $5 tickets no problem. 

The seats were amazingly comfortable and the process in which to order the food was quick and easy. Overall, though I would say that we will be taking our business back to the city for a slightly better price and menu."}
{"text":"Sat in the icebox that was theater 11 with no sound for 20 minutes. Management gave me my money back, but didn't offer to turn the sound on instead?

We were the only ones in the theater and I asked 3 times, but it seems they rather just give you your money back. Oh well."}
{"text":"Wrong wrong wrong.  The reviews are not a true view of this place.  I engaged with no less than 6 employees and all were more than acomodating.  Great seating and a clean theater.  Pizza was great but small.  Not cheap but a great experience.  I do not think you will be disappointed.  Give it a try...you'll like it."}
{"text":"I love their popcorn and I actually think it's a great idea. But then sitting in the dark with your food so far away and people ripping the paper towels off the roll and making noise and waitstaff doing their best to stay out of the way leaves a little to be desired. Anyway it's definitely worth a trip to see if it's for you. If you love it then the 5 dollar Tuesdays will be great and the various groupons will make it easier to go."}
{"text":"When I first discovered this place,  I was in love.  I refused to go anywhere else because well, who can beat food, beer, and no kids allowed in certain movies! But over time,  the space has fallen off by one star. Every time I go I have to ask for the volume to be turned up and the food preparation takes more than 30 minutes even when the movie is only half full.  The staff is always amazing and I will continue to go, just not to a kids movie. 
UPDATE: came back today for the first time in a while. This place NEEDS to be updated desperately!!! Seats are cracking and the sound is still bad. Service has gone down hill even more from the last time. Took the server 20 minutes after we pushed out service button to show up..I will never go back again."}
{"text":"I have only visited this location as a guest of Yelp for an elite event.  So I will grant it 4 stars as that is a special event and probably not indicative of a nightly occurance and want to visit again before I put the 5th star up there.

I will say, hands down, that I was very very very impressed. 

The staff was friendly and accommodating and by staff I mean every single person I came in contact with.  The building itself is updated, the seats are very comfortable, the food is excellent.

I would recommend this to anyone who has kids, and is trying to get out of the house for a date night.  Babysitters can be expensive, so why not combine the dinner w/ the movie. Hang out afterwords at the bar for a last glass of wine or beer, play a game of pool or listen to some live music. All at the same building we used to sneak into in High School (Providence High - Go Panthers!).

One thing I hate about going to the movies is spending $170 and getting popcorn and a diet coke that is so large my bladder bursts at the least opportune time. Not the problem at Cinebarre.

I took a gander at the full menu last night once I got home, and I feel that it is accurately priced for both food and beverage. I love the concept, it's not as pricey, inconvenient, or stuffy as Mez.  They did a great job coming up with movie friendly food that tastes great.  I like fine cuisine, but struggling with any utensil that isn't my fingers is not what I want to do while watching a movie, so for this, their menu is perfect.

I don't know what their plans are, or how many converted theatres they have available but this to me SCREAMS - \"SPORTS!!!\"

Love the concept of getting a \"bucket\" of beers. 

I would be showing Duke v. Carolina, Panthers games when they are in the playoffs this year (I said it), Bobcats games when they are in the plaaaaa... nevermind.  But a huge screen showing the \"BIG\" game with sports friendly foods and beer and wine.. umm yes please!

The only thing I would add would be a tap light style system under the counter top so people can see what they are writing/reading without busting out the mobile phone. 

Other than that. Keep up the good work, we'll be seeing you soon."}
{"text":"It's a really comfy place to watch movies, and if you can deal with the price, the milkshakes are super good, if not a bit small. I almost always go here to see the new release of my choice."}
{"text":"Good beer and great food. Awesome place to spend an afternoon or evening to watch Jurassic World."}
{"text":"Food is horrible. Nobody in my party enjoyed their sandwich. The floor was greasy. The menu was wet and sticky."}
