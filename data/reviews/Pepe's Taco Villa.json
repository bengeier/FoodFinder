{"text":"Food that tastes just like Mama used to make!  The absolute best Mexican food around!  Great owners as well!"}
{"text":"When we asked some local Mexican friends where to go for authentic Mexican food and, in particular, mole, they unanimously recommended Pepe's.  Howard Seftel's AZ Republic review also recommended the chicken enchiladas with mole.

We went for lunch on a Sunday and fortunately did not witness any \"deals\" going down.  The restaurant's in a stand-alone building with ample parking.  It's spacious inside with high-backed wooden booths and a long bar.

We ordered:
- Enchiladas de Pollo con Mole:  3 flour tortillas wrapped around shredded chicken breast, covered with black mole and cheese, served with refried beans and rice
 - Tacos Rancheros:  mildly spicy slow-braised pork in choice of soft or crispy taco

The verdict:
- The mole sauce was a delicious combination of spices and chocolate - we wished there could've been more.  I actually prefer dark meat so next time I'll order the Mole Poblano, where they give you choice of chicken leg or breast.  
- Described as a house specialty, the pork was tender and infused with spices.  According to a review posted on the wall, chopped chorizo is also mixed in. 

Dishes on average run between $8 to $10.

We're eager to go back to try the green corn tamales, taco monterrey (machado (sun-dried beef) w/ scrambled eggs) and of course, more mole!"}
{"text":"The wife and I went all out, I got the chili Colorado mix with the green and red sauce. She ordered the steak and quesadilla with rice and beans. We also shared a carnitas taco. All the food was amazing, great flavor, cooked to perfection came out hot and fast. I can't wait to come back in the near future."}
{"text":"For anyone who has not been here, please show up on a Tuesday so you can try their amazing tacos first hand. The location will make you worry initially, but do not be afraid, it is very cozy and clean inside!! It's got your standard bar seating along with an abundance of seating areas around the restaurant. 

The green salsa is amazing, my coworker and I can always down a bottle and a half in one sitting. It has wonderful kick to it and the texture is just perfect. You'll be munching more chips than you ever imagine (and this is before your order comes in). You can also buy the bottle of salsa to take home if you can't have enough of that goodness.

Taco Tuesdays has $1 tacos (grounded or shredded beef) and $2 coronas. Do not be afraid of eating more than 5!!! It is that good. 

I've also tried their Chicken Mole enchiladas and their chimichanga. Pretty good size for the price and quite tasty. 

The staff there is very friendly and will engage in good conversation with you (even when they are swamped with customers on a Tuesday). Shoutout to Jose/Luce! You guys are da bomb.

All in all, very reasonably priced mexican food and consistent. A little jewel on Camelback Rd that should be discovered by anyone that enjoys Mexican food."}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican food restaurants in Arizona. I drive all the way from Goodyear to eat here. The green sauce cheese enchiladas with rice and beans is amazing.."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Everything is excellent!  The tacos are perfect and crunchy and the steak fajitas are delish!

I love the atmosphere too!  It's one of three places I got to when I'm craving Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday is too busy for them to handle , they need more help it's very confusing when they are busy they seem very overwhelmed and the service is all wonky and be prepared to wait if the table is empty and not clean they will make you wait , so you can not be in a hurry and sometimes they run out of tacos"}
{"text":"Great prices to portion ratio, homemade taste and atmosphere. The loss of a star is just for the lack of staff attention. Otherwise I Love this place."}
{"text":"Wonderful place for Mexican food if you don't mind venturing into the aves. Cute bright yellow building, and quaint kitschy interior. Chips and salsa are very good - salsa is a little spicy (even the mild) and chips taste homemade. I ordered the steak and chicken tacos. Steak was very moist and well-seasoned but the chicken was a little bland. Have also tried the enchiladas and didn't regret it. Finally, if anything, stop by for the margaritas - lots of flavored and a nice pour!"}
{"text":"My new spot!! Great service from the moment I walked in. It felt like a family owned place. Me and my bf had a great experience here. Food amazing!!! I had the mole enchiladas they were delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Highly regarded by a trusted local, we were sent here for the al pastor tacos and the mole, both equally fantastic.  But we weren't told we'd see \"deals\" go down in the alley out back and also witness girls smoking crack driving down the street.  We're not from around there so we chalked it up to the way the locals do it.  Made me wonder if the tacos would've tasted better after a smoke."}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place! The food is great and the service is good and at times very entertaining! When we have a craving for Mexican food this is the place we go. Have never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"Fantastic staff, and food.  I'm a Mexican food snob and this place definitely passes the test. Great mole' and flan.  I met a lot of regulars here too which is a good sign."}
{"text":"I first went to Pepe's when my buddies from the dorms at ASU would hit up a different Mexican place every Friday night. We tried to pick ones on various 'best of Phoenix' lists, and that's how we ended up at Pepe's.

Pepe's is in kind of an out-of-the-way part of central Phoenix. But if you're anywhere close, it's well worth the stop.

The chicken mole enchiladas I got were smothered in the best mole sauce I've ever had, and my wife's carnitas in green chile sauce were equally amazing. The refried beans were good enough to finish, a rarity for any Mexican restaurant.

Adding to the great experience, the service was upbeat and friendly--our server was as excited about the menu items as he was about the Suns' winning streak--and a hearty dinner for two rang up just over $20."}
{"text":"Come to Pepe's when in Phoenix. Good food and great margaritas. Great service, friendly and fun."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and had the chicken chimi with green enchilada sauce.  It tasted great.  I liked the chips and both the green salsa (mildly spicy) and the red salsa (spicy).

Prices were reasonable for what I expected, especially the lunch specials."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was 13 before they remodeled.  The service and food have always been exceptional. The traditional Mexican food flavors a are satisfying and worth every penny.  I suggest the number 17 carne Asada taco plate or the enchilada Suisas with chicken instead of beef.  The red and green salsa they provide freely with chips won't disappoint if you like the heat of good chilies!  The Micheladas aren't bad.   And the chiliquiles with and egg on top if a great pick for breakfast.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I think Pepes is awesome! There food is soo good and their staff is super friendly. What a great hole in the wall restaurant! I love this place!"}
{"text":"I can't review anything besides the tacos, rice and beans. I love stoping by with my son for taco Tuesday and loading up on \"my usual\".
The staff really makes you feel at home, literally."}
{"text":"SuPeR spicy red salsa! Beware! Delicious but HOT! I got the pollo chimichanga and it was awesome! Also the tacos were were 5 stars as well (says the boyfriend)"}
{"text":"Best Mexican Restaurant in the Valley- hands down! Basically home made and whoever is working in the kitchen can cook!!! Amazing people too! Always friendly and very attentive. My favorites are their bean tostadas, chilaquiles, Bean chimi, and green corn tamales. Everything in the menu is good- you can't go wrong! Food always comes out hot and flavorful! A must to check out if you are in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday!  $1 tacos and $2 coronas all day!  Two of us had the Taco Pizza and 9 tacos!  Great food, great price, great service!!!"}
{"text":"Solid lunch specials! Generous with the salsa and hot sauce! The Albondigas soup is amaze balls!!! Love it. Big portions, tasty food and small check...nothing to complain about here!!!"}
{"text":"Continuing on my whirlwind tour of Phoenix Mexican restaurants, I stopped by here for lunch today. I wasn't disappointed, but wasn't blown away either -- save for by the green chile burrito. That was fantastic. 

I also ordered carne asada tacos. I found them uninspired. Still searching for any carne asada nearly as delicious as that of the dearly departed original America's Taco Shop. 

For something new, I also tried the Monterrey taco (stuffed with shredded beef and scrambled egg) since it was at the top of their 'house specialities' menu. Meh. It was really soggy and dripped lots of oil. But it was tasty nevertheless. 

Oh, their tortillas rank among the best I've had, and their chips are really good too -- light and crispy, with red and green sauce."}
{"text":"I work over on Camelback so I decided to check this place out.  Its nice to be pleasantly surprised.  I ordered the Chicken Chimichanga for lunch.  The obligatory chips and salsa came out first-the chips were not the greatest-the salsas were ok.  

As far as the chimichanga, it was excellent, one of the best I've had recently.  The chicken inside was white meat and it was tender and flavorful-the deep fried tortilla was crisp on the outside and somewhat softer on the inside.  I am not a big fan of rice in general but the rice they served with the meal was great. 

If I am in the area, I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Been going here for over 20 years. This is the best Mexican food on the planet, don't skip out on the Tacos Monterrey. #75 is where it's at."}
{"text":"Best authentic Mexican food hands down. I've just divorced any other joint I've been to. This is it. Mic drop."}
{"text":"My husband and I love to go here for Taco Tuesday. We try no to miss any Tuesday. Food is great and service is friendly. We love to support family/local restaurants. Keep up the good work guys."}
{"text":"Decent food but nothing spectacular. We made a log journey to get here and both my wife and I said while good, it wasn't worth the long trip.

The Margarita was very small and was gone in a couple sips. Could not taste any alcohol at all.

One item of note...I had tacos and the shells looked like boxed shells. I was expecting some fresh fried shells on the crunchy tacos but no such luck.

Good place to eat if you're in the area but definitely don't go out of your way to find this place."}
{"text":"A seat yourself, cenPho authentic Mexican restaurant. A patron for over ten years and the food and service has not yet left me unsatisfied.  Friendly staff with great smiles, family- ran, booth or table seating, fun decor, good chips with delicious home- made salsas, a variety of delicious dishes, and speedy service.  Try the mole, barbacoa, albondigas soup or anything on the menu and you'll be fulfilled and content.  One con: no beer on tap."}
{"text":"OMG, so good! The guacamole sauce on my chicken soft taco was delish and I'll be back just for the refried beans alone. A big plus for the kids meal bean & cheese burrito too. It was just the right size for my 4 year old and he gobbled it up."}
{"text":"If you're looking for real, authentic Mexican food - Pepe's is the place to go. I have been going for the past 15 years. It's my all time favorite Mexican food restaurant. I get the red chili. Their home made tortillas are to die for! Their refried beans are incredible. And their rice is unlike anything you've ever tasted. You must take your friends and family to Pepe's on your next night out! I love Jose, the man who runs the show. It's family owned, so his mom does the cooking in the kitchen with his sister and other siblings. It's really homey and a great atmosphere. They are all very friendly. There is always a game on the TV when you're there. There's also take-out, which is very convenient. MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"YUM. Enchiladas suizas are deeeeeelicious! That's the extent of my order, so I can't opine much more than that. Service was excellent, prompt and friendly. I went early on a Saturday evening and the place was maybe half-full, pretty quiet and relaxed, just the way I like it."}
{"text":"Heard about the carne seca Monterrey taco and went on a mission to find this wonderful thing. It was well worth the drive just to get a taco that is better than the usual stuff you get everywhere else- eggs, beef, onion, nestled in a light, airy, toasted tortilla. Love, love, love it!"}
{"text":"Pepe's is a cozy, family ran place that serves some awesome food! The prices are excellent! The staff is extremely friendly and make you feel at home! I've eaten here before and have forgotten to write a review. Sorry Pepe's!!
My tacos were excellent..as always!!"}
{"text":"The first time I went here I would have given it 3 stars. Nothing close to what has been written about it. I went back a 2nd time and it was awful. 

I couldn't put my finger on it but the salsa had a very strange taste to it. My entire meal was bland. I was pretty hungry and couldn't finish half of it. The service was slow and the place was dead. I'm not sure what happened. The first time I tried it I swear it was half decent. 

I wont be going back for a third visit. There are way too many Mexican restaurants on my list to try to waste more cash and time on this one."}
{"text":"Good stuff. Ordered carnitas & iv was cooked perfectly.  The sauce is perfectly spicy too!  I recommend."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday Special!!

The best part is the $1.00 tacos. They come in ground beef and shredded beef. 

We all agreed, they are delicious! We polished down 4 tacos each with a side of beans and rice 

What could make taco tuesday any better? How about margaritas for $3.50 each. We got the house margaritas on the rocks and they were a little sweet but they tasted fine. 

Over all our bill was under 30! 

We will absolutely go back and try other menu items."}
{"text":"Pepe's is everything you would expect of a local non-chain mexican restaurant. Warm chips, good salsa, local waiters, good dishes, mediocre sides, and a south-of-the-border decor. I visited for lunch on a Wednesday and had no problem being immediately seated. We each had one of the lunch special dishes: burrito with red sauce, enchiladas with red sauce, and a chimichanga with red sauce - all with rice & beans.  Let me say that the chips and salsa were the highlight of the meal. Although it was good enough that i would go back to try a Mexican Pizza or a dish of chicken mole."}
{"text":"This place screams \"Authentic Mexican food\" the minute you walk in and inhale .  The best part is, they can accommodate to a keto eating life style! Super friendly and fast service too. The food was so delicious! I can't wait until I can eat beans again!"}
{"text":"Pepe's Taco Villa is truly authentic Mexican food, my parents are from Mexico so I grew up eating Mexican food, we moved to central Phoenix almost two years ago and always noticed the place next door to it with all the Mexican furniture but never noticed Pepe's..One Saturday night my boyfriend and I were thinking what should we eat? he's white and loves Mexican food, but I don't usually like what he likes because he likes kind of bland Mexican food, well we saw Pepe's and stopped there...oh my god their food is AMAZING!! and their services is really great, we have been there many times now in the past two months and recommend it to everybody, their enchiladas, tacos, mole, and menudo are very very tasty....I'm so glad we found a spot that we both like a lot."}
{"text":"This place was highly recommended by a local. We arrived and were a little skeptical because it was almost empty. Turned out that we had just missed the rush! Our luck! This place does not look impressive at first glance, but let the food do all the talking. Everything was absolutely great. This is a family owned restaurant and our waiter was a great host.

I had the enchiladas de mole. Wonderful. The Mole sauce is great, a rich red color and they claim, made in-house.  Others in our group had the costillas en salsa verde and they were very pleased. Tortillas were great, not store bought stiff tortillas. 

We didn't have margaritas, but I was told that they are wonderful, too. Next time in Phoenix, we will definitely drop in once more and try something else on the menu. Great job keeping Mexican food true to its roots."}
{"text":"Not impressed.  The staff was not motivated and the food was very, very average.  We had the green corn tamales and a wet burrito.  the green corn tamales were actually decent but pass on the wet burrito.  The worst part for me was that the refried beans were extremely runny.  Its definitely a hole in the wall, and i thought a little run down, but its gotten decent reviews from others.  so i'm willing to say we didn't do good on our food choices.  So good luck with yours (but with so many delicious mexican food options in the valley, why go here?"}
{"text":"First, let me address the reviewers ahead of me that had a problem with \"salsa in a squeeze bottle.\"  - You haven't been eating Mexican food very long, have you?? - or in Mexico.  Get a clue, people! The concept of chunky salsa in a bowl on the table is a fairly new. I  remember trips to Mexico where not a salsa dish could be found, so if you want \"authentic\" - the \"salsa\" in the squeeze bottle was what all my friends had on their family table when growing up in the 70's. Now.....with that said, I am always enthusiastic about an authentic family-owned Mex restaurant, but Pepe's was just mediocre. The service was friendly.....until they had a family party of 16 to prioritize, and service slowed to a crawl.  Also, that family \"event\" was so noisy a few feet from us that we could not converse and grew impatient to leave. 
Margaritas - our server enthusiastically claimed he \"makes the best in Phoenix.\" If you tell me that, you had better start with fresh limes and not a mix. Bummer, it was a mix, and not great tequila. Mediocre.  I LOVE mole, so I ordered the #14 - chicken mole enchiladas. Their \"award\" on the wall claims \"Best  mole in Phoenix\" ....but that was 2000. I'm not sure what happened in 12 years, but the mole was \"blah.\" Mole has nearly 30 ingredients in it so the flavors are usually complex. This was just......nothing. Not sweet, not smoky, not spicy - and l left me longing for Frank and Lupe's. Normally, I will give a place more than one visit before reviewing, but I have no intention of coming back here."}
{"text":"This has been my fourth visit to Pepe's and it was just as good as the first time. This time I tried the red chili burrito. The meat was soft and the red chili was excellent, plus the tortilla made the burrito. I will give it four stars only because I'm not a good writer or good at reviews."}
{"text":"Really delicious family owned and operated restaurant! Traditional Mexican flavors and recipes!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch on a Saturday.  The service was quick and friendly.  Overall, it's a very clean well kept place. The booths are spacious and comfortable. I got the mole enchiladas and they were amazing. Very authentic mexican food. I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Just happened to be in the area so we stopped in for lunch.  Had the shredded beef taco plate it was really good along with the beans and rice.  Chips and salsas were good.  I ordered a Michelada which I was not very fond of it just had a different taste like it wasn't made with clamato.  Overall service was good."}
{"text":"They are all super friendly. The service is fast! And the good is amazing. Their tacos are fantastic! This place is great."}
{"text":"My friend an I go to this place every Saturday morning for hangover recovery,  the staff is friendly,  the cooking is just like my momma,  gotta love it!"}
{"text":"I've been enjoying meals at Pepe's Taco Villa since they opened in 1983, the food is great.

What I really want you to know is Pepe's is open on Tuesday's although Yelp does not show that.

Also Tuesdays is Taco Tuesday's with $1.00 Tacos Ground or Shredded Beef Dorados.

Stop in any time and enjoy a great meal."}
{"text":"Service was great and tonight they have taco Tuesday one dollar shredded beef or ground beef tacos and two dollar Coronas"}
{"text":"Wowza! I love this place. After years of driving past Pepe's we finally stopped in ...on you guessed...yup..right on Taco Tuesday. How was it? Sooooo goooood. The chips and salsa are made in house and you'll for sure get tears from that salsa. The tacos are huge and insane delicious and you can choose soft or crispy. Crispy baby!! So good...so so so good. For $1 you really get your buck's worth. Oh but just wait until you taste the green corn tamales. I am such a sucker for these green chiles. Come to mama you hot tamale!! So darn good that I had to take some home. We brought a group of friends here and they all agreed how damn good it is. Pepe's has 4 new customers. Definitely coming back. We'll all be there. Like. Next Tuesday."}
{"text":"If you're looking for one of the best holes in the wall, check out Pepe's Taco Villa. It's been in business forever and there's a good reason: the food is consistently top notch.

The chicken mole is worth doing a spin class for. It's easilt the best mole in town. No competition.

If you're looking for something different, try the Mexican pizza. Again, the best I've had in Phoenix.

It's not the fanciest place, but it's one of the best."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great and staff is friendly.  We were presented with a basket of chips and two bottles of salsa when we sat down.
I ordered a beef chimichanga.  Bleh, no flavor.  Would not come back."}
{"text":"Came for dinner with husband and kids. Service was great. I was a bit disappointed that their chips and salsa is chips with two bottles of sauce (red and green). Sauces were yummy, but I like having a bowl of sauce/salsa to dip. Mexican pizza was delicious as was their rice and beans. Husband ordered the enchiladas suizas and the chicken was a bit dry but still tasty. I ordered the carne asada and what came out was a bone-in steak. Meat was seasoned well but not what I was expecting as I had to cut away much of what was on my plate."}
{"text":"I spotted the cool big rust colored metal sun on the side of the building & suggested trying this place instead of driving to Rolberto's on 7th St & Camelback.

I'm trying not to judge this place too harshly since the happy hour prices are pretty darn good & the people are super friendly. I want to go back & try more things on their menu with different sauces & styles.

Free chips but you don't get that many at a time. They're a little greasy, but still good. I love chunky salsa & there isn't any. They have 2 different kinds that come in bottles. The more brownish 1 had a smokey almost chipotle flavor. It was actually really good.

My meal: Chicken chimi. No melted cheese on top, came on the side. No pico de gallo, costs $1.50 extra. Majorly unhappy about that. If it came automatically I'd really like this place. Meat was a little bland.

Friend's meal: Chicken chimi recommended by Jose enchilada style w/ green sauce which was an extra $1-1.50. The chimi needed the sauce to not be as bland. It did taste really good this way. Beans & rice is an extra $2. Refried beans were good. They weren't salty & were very cheesy.

My happy hour $3.50 house margarita came in a margarita glass! What's with places not using margarita glasses?! It could have used more salt. At least they didn't water it down or skimp on alcohol. I wasn't carded. I'm over 21 & was the only 1 drinking but my friend is not 21 yet. He was driving but they probably would have served him.

I like the decor. They have a room or 2 off the main 1 for overflow or big crowds. The restroom wasn't necessarily dirty, but it was pretty run down. The mirror in there is way too nice for the restroom. It's funny.

We also had 2 soft drinks. The bill was almost $30 total."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time yesterday and I'll definitely be going back.  I had the super nachos while my buddy had the burrito, both were fantastic.  Their chips are awesome.  My only gripe there was no salsa; however, you can order pico de gallo and add their sauce to it.

There special on Tuesdays, Rock!

As for the comment about \"being worried about the area\", perhaps if you are alone at night walking, it might be a bit sketchy since there is a liquor store just across the street that tends to draw a certain crowd, but I would not let that deter me from dining here.  Besides, you are parking in the lot, not walking the streets."}
{"text":"Definitely a 2 to 3 star place . I'm Mexican and know good food when it comes to it and even though we live near Mexico  it's still hard to find good Mexican food . This place was a baby step above Filabertos.. The menudo was super salty and very greasy  the salsa is mild and don't expect chips and salsa in your to go order . The chicken tacos did have quality meat, seemed to be all white chicken, but don't expect it to be a stuffed taco and the rice is bland and mushy."}
{"text":"Mexican is not my fave, but I have dined here now 5X and last night was the best! There were 8 of us. My guests from the Midwest wanted mole. They said it was the finest they had ever had. Our server was Jose. He was attentive, accommodating to some intense food request (!), warm, funny and teased us appropriately. Can't wait to go back. Thanks Jose!"}
{"text":"I'm always happy to stop in here to eat and chop it up. It appreciate the neighborly feel of the place, it's a family-owned and operated restaurant and basically another kind of Cheers. Everyone from the neighborhood stops by and you always feel welcomed and encouraged to stay and play. I was there yesterday and am making my way back there in a few"}
{"text":"Did I mention I'm a HUGE fan when it comes to chips and salsa.  Chips were ok and salsa was more like hot green/ red sauce. No chunks, no tomatoes, no cilantro. No Bueno. Cheese crisp aka quesadilla, was pretty tasty full of cheesy goodness. Steak picado was good too. Not sure if if I would come back for seconds. Or thirds! Waitress was  nice. Service was fast."}
{"text":"Really good homemade Mexican Food.  Red and Green  salsa with chips included.  Very reasonable prices and daily specials.  Margarita is good too.  Friendly family service."}
{"text":"When I worked on the west side, I would pass by a small Mexican import store every day on my way to work. I knew it was there from the random Mexican furniture displayed on the sidewalk. I never thought in a million years, I would ever actually step foot into that place, but then one day my boss at the time took me to lunch and yes, we ended up at Pepe's. The Mexican furniture lined the sidewalk as I approached the restaurant, and I'm not sure if it's attached to Pepe's or just conveniently located next door, but it definitely adds to the authenticity of the restaurant. 

This is truly a restaurant where you can't judge it by its cover and questionable location on the outside. Once you step foot inside, it's a fun and divey little Mexican food shop. Prices are extremely low and the food is good. The salsa has a nice kick to it and the food is pretty high in calories but also high in taste. 

I like Pepe's for a decent west-side option for lunchtime. It's a quick, tasty and cheap option for a sit-down restaurant. The Mexican decor on the walls adds to the experience and I could just as easily be in a little restaurant in Cabo instead of being in a restaurant on Camelback and 21st Ave. 

This is definitely a spot worthy of checking out if you're in the area during lunchtime and looking for a tasty lunch time treat."}
{"text":"Came in for Friday lunch and found a clean restaurant with a decent crowd. Hubby ordered beef tacos and was pleasantly surprised that they contained chopped beef instead of the usual ground beef. I ordered my usual chicken chimi and it was packed with shredded chicken, probably the most I have ever been served in a chimi. 

Although it is a bit of a drive we will back again."}
{"text":"Place is absolutely authentic. Food has so much fresh taste to it. I offers a family oriented atmosphere with amazing customer service. Chips & salsa is awesome too. I haven't had the pleasure to have their margaritas yet, but my entire family and friends praise them. I can't wait to eat everything off the menu and try out the margaritass. Make sure to take care of your waiters, they work very hard to be attentive to your needs. Thanks Pepe's for having such a great restaurant."}
{"text":"We have a girls night dinner once a month and pick some place that no one has been before! All the great reviews that this place has are spot on. We were greeted by a great friendly guy, I will call him \"Andy\".. he sat us down told us about the restaurant  and drinks, it was like we're were family. The food was delicious. Each of us tried something different, I will definitely go back and skip those other Mexican restaurants."}
{"text":"Needed to venture out and find new lunch spots near GCU campus since I no longer work in Tempe... this one was one of the closest.

They have a plethora of lunch specials and I chose the beef smothered chimi today.  The beef itself was cooked well but was kind of bland - but it came with sour cream / guac / rice / beans and was $7.50.

My buddy got the horchata and said it was money... the service was spectacular!  Offered a to go cup for my lemonade w/o even asking and the chips & salsa were refilled without request.

Due to it's proximity to work, I'll probably be back a couple times a month and will try the green chile burro next since it smelled great.

Side note - the curb appeal of almost everything in this part of town that isn't GCU campus is severely lacking - but once you get inside it's clean and pleasant!"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food!!  I'm of Mexican decent, and picky about my Mexican food.  Not too many places do mole, and not only do these guys do mole, but it's excellent!  Everything is top notch.  I love that the prices are so reasonable, but the food is so good, I would gladly pay more.  We've had server, Isela a couple of times, and she is wonderful!  Sweet, personable, and very attentive.  These guys are also very open to alterations."}
{"text":"We'd also like to rant about how great Pepe's is. From our first visit, hungover after a night of Dbacks and Amsterdam, when I introduced Jenny to menudo (girl is from Arizona and had never menudo'd as a hangover remedy, can you believe it?) to yesterday, our first visit since going vegetarian, Pepe's is consistent. Prices, food, and service are all good and that's all anyone should be asking for in the Avenues."}
{"text":"Love this place.  I have been here about half a dozen times and never had a bad experience.  Very friendly staff and I love the chicken chimichanga with the green sauce.  The margaritas are pretty good too!"}
{"text":"Been coming here since I was a baby. Amazing food. Makes you feel like you're part of the family!"}
{"text":"I grew up in Phoenix and lived there for 20 years before moving to the Pacific Northwest. I miss real Mexican food as it really doesn't exist over here. I have come to realize how spoiled I was by living in Arizona where any given taco stand can serve Amazing food. With all of this said, my father introduced my wife and I recently to Pepe's! Without exaggeration, this place might serve some of the BEST Mexican food I have ever had! We of course ordered some delicious margaritas that got the party started and then I preceded to order the green sauce enchiladas with Pepe's own guacamole...a taste sensation in every bite. The staff was super friendly and the restaurant feels like what a great Mexican Arizona Restaurant should feel like. I cannot wait for a return visit!  Pepe's...you have my permission to drop the mic. That's how it's done son!"}
{"text":"By far, the best Mexican food I've had so far in Phoenix/Scottsdale.  Yum!  First, their chips and salsas rock.  The perfect amount of kick.  There was a menudo on special, which our waitress recommended but let us try a cup before ordering.  It was ok, but you could tell what you were eating.  I'm glad I tried it, but not my lunch of choice.  I ended up ordering an enchilada dish - 2 mole enchiladas and one with a green sauce.  I was not impressed with the green sauce - it seemed to be VERY heavy on the cilantro, but I LOVED the chicken mole enchiladas.  Yum!  Also was served with rice & beans and they were great.  My boyfriend had two different tacos off the menu, he thought they were both OK but nothing too great.  He did tell me that he had the barbacoa there in the past and LOVED it, but I will have to take his word on it.  It doesn't look so great on the outside, but I would definitely recommend this to others and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I am not sure I have ever had mole before or if maybe I have had it and not liked it so stayed away.  Whatever, I did like the mole on my chicken enchiladas.  The enchiladas themselves were soso.  Quite often in Mexican restaurants I have to mix the rice and beans together to get them down for several reasons.  This time the rice and beans each stood on their own merits.  The chips were good and served warm.  I preferred the red salsa, even though it was hotter, as it had more flavor to me.  It is sort of runny and is a bit hard to chase around the little plate that comes for that purpose.  The enchiladas came with all white meat, my favorite, but I could have done without the chunk of cartilage and two bone pieces I found.

Many of the customers there during lunch on a Friday seemed like regulars.  I don't think I heard a single word of Spanish from either customers or employees the whole time I was in there.  The dining room with it's flagstone floors has a nice comfy feel to it.  There were two waitresses that seemed like they were working as a team and I didn't wait long or want for anything.  The parking lot holds small cars easier than trucks but there were several work trucks in there.

A good solid place to eat if you are in the area but not a destination place from far away."}
{"text":"Very disappointing dinner at Pepe's!!! After being sat in a sauna for what was like 20 minutes, and being asked by every server if someone took our drink order, we are finally get drinks. Then the waitress vanished for another 10 minutes and comes back and takes our order. Then finally 30 minutes later we finally receive our food. The look of the food is good, A beef chimi Rice and beans. First bite, it taste like it was fried in fish grease. The chimi has no real defined taste, bland fishy. The Guacamole taste like frozen store quality. 
After sweating with inedible food, we finally flag down a different server, because our server has vanished, to get a box and our bill...
 Another long time Phoenix restaurant gone down hill... So sad!!!! Poor service and low quality food!!!"}
{"text":"I've passed Pepe's Taco Villa for years and decided to stop in for what else? TACOS! Well... Big Time disappointment! I had the # 13, Crispy Chicken Tacos, side of rice & beans and a Guacamole Cheese Crisp.  The Tacos were exactly like the ones served up in grade school; Come on Pepe, taco shells out of a box!!!! Chicken was bland, and the rice & beans were average. The Salsa was more like Katsup with chili peppers. The Cheese Crisp was Great but It takes a lot to mess up a cheese crisp. I give 2 stars for the guac, it was the only thing that tasted \"authentico\" to me. Too Bad oh soo sad. Now I must tend to my heartburn. Adios!"}
{"text":"This was my 1st time here. I was disappointed because I enjoyed everthing but the food. (Nothing like the pics)   Maybe it was just an off day. I am giving 5-stars for the gentleman at the register / bar, he kept engaging with us and making us feel very welcomed"}
{"text":"Super-friendly service. Absolutely adore their chicken mole. My wife literally asks them for a cupful to take home almost every time we go. They do the Mexican staples well, and my kids love it, too"}
{"text":"Im not a huge fan of Mexican because what so many consider \"authentic\" is bland and tastes like retirement food. When it comes to Mexican I prefer the frou frou such as Padre's or Barrio. So when the Urban Spoon app picked this place I was a bit reluctant but I go wherever the Urban Spoon App takes me. I had preconceived notions about what this place would be like. I figured order at the counter, they make it ,you sit down and eat it. I wasn't even close. It definitely would be what most consider \"divey\", dimly lit, tons of booths and dare I say \"adorable\" with full service inclusive of bar. Tvs in the corners with various sports going on, menus with pictures (awesome)..everything is numbered so you dont have to make an ass out of yourself trying to pronounce something you know damn well you have no idea how to.  Service was fast and with a smile, no complaints there. Now for the food. Im not a fan of the corn tortilla..possibly because Pink Taco was the only place I ever had one and it left me with the wrong impression. So I ordered their Taco Siberia (double wrapped in corn tortilla) and now I understand the fuss. It opened up a whole new world and I am no longer a corn tortilla hater! But what I really want to rave about is the side of potatoes and onions I had. OMFG. Freakin awesome. They were like perfectly seasoned non french fried french fries?Its the best way to explain.. trust me, order and you will understand. This place is true authentic flavorful Mexican food and the prices were ridiculously inexpensive. Such a find."}
{"text":"Loved this place! The waiter was friendly and helpful, the food was Amazing! Had the chicken chili with sour cream and guacamole, beans and rice. Couldn't eat it all! A bit of a drive for us but well worth it!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I were in Phoenix scoping out places to live (currently in Chicago) and we tried Pepe's on a whim. Then we came back the next day...
Shredded beef tacos are delicious. I'm also a huge fan of their refried beans, especially on the tostada. Love this place. Guarantee we will be regulars once we move!"}
{"text":"The best chicken mole ever!  Try the enchiladas.  Fabulous. I go with the intention of trying something else, but can't bring myself to do it.  My wife does, however, and she raves about the other dishes she's adventuresome enough to try."}
{"text":"My favorite lunch spot by my work. 

When you look at it from the outside, Pepe's Taco Villa looks like a hole. But walk inside and it's surprisingly nice. They have a nice little bar with a big flat screen (currently watching the World Cup and eating a taco). 

As far as the food goes, I've only tried the carne asada tacos, but I gotta say, it's some of the best carne asada I've EVER HAD. Juicy, flavorful, and delicious. And they include Guacamole on the tacos (awesome). 

Come here for a nice little sit down lunch or takeout and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Food was awesome!! I order chicken tacos, came out fast and was full of flavor. Was on this side of town and this place had great reviews and now I know why"}
{"text":"I was on the hunt for a sit down Mexican restaruant on my way home. I couple places I passed because the parking lot was filled and I was by myself and needed quiet.

I pulled in to this tiny parking lot and was relieved to see only a few cars. I walked in and I stood there for a second when First waitress told me to sit anywhere. So I walked in and grabbed a booth. First waitress took my drink order: Horchata and a water. Second waitress came up handing me a menu and asking for my drink order. I told her First already took it.

A few minutes later Second came back with chips, two different salsa's and a glass of water. I gave her my order: Friday Special Albondigas soup with flour tortilla and a side of refried beans. She walked away and a minute later returned to ask me again if I wanted flour or corn tortilla.

Well I waited for my dinner, I dived into the chips and salsa. First issue, the salsa are in SQUEEZE BOTTLES. Really!?!? How am I going to dip my chip in this?? On this small PLATE?! Annoyed. Needless to say I made a mess but I enjoyed them. The green salsa was nice and spicy. The red had that \"burnt\" taste. I don't know how to describe it, its not actually burnt ...maybe a mole type taste. But both were delicious regardless, even if it wasn't chunky salsa.

My soup arrived in a HUGE bowl with 4 HUGE meatballs. Chunks of tomato, bell pepper and onions. You can taste the tomato sauce and was very flavorful and came with a side of rice. My beans were in a large dish and the tortilla was nice and hot. The soup was sooo delicious I'm still thinking about it today!! The rice though was a bit disappointing, there was chunks in it like it had been sitting all day. The beans I had to scrap the cheese to the side but they were about average but perfect couple with the chip and salsa.

During my meal I realized First waitress never brought me my drinks. But Second waitress was very attentive and when she checked on me I asked for my Horchata.

It was a cute little restaurant, the booths backs are very tall for privacy and the margarita's must have been good because every 5mins I heard the blender go off.
With the exception of First waitress, the service was excellent, Second had stopped by making sure I had everything I needed several times. Everything together cost $13.07! Very inexpensive for a delicious huge meal.

I will be back."}
{"text":"Good service and very good food. I had the chicken chimi with sour cream and guacamole and it was delicious. It must have  had been made with an entire chicken breast! Very filling! $1 tacos and $2 Coronas on Tuesday. Nice, crispy chips and spicy salsa. See you there Tuesday."}
{"text":"Good quality fresh chicken.   I had the chimichanga and it was really big.  Service is great. I enjoyed it.  Cool atmosphere and nice people.  Tasty and fresh.  Seems like a great time for groups.  A cute bar with lots of Mexican decor including sombreros."}
{"text":"Love this place! They remember us when we come in.  They have excellent shrimp tacos.  You can't beat taco Tuesday!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Mexican food in this state!  Pepe's taco villa is 100% authentic Mexican dining! I have been going to Pepe's now for about 20 years and have never been disappointed! Pepe's re-fried beans are to die for, just like many of their other dishes! The food is always consistent and very reasonably priced! The service is warm and friendly. The owners daughter Luce who now runs Pepe's adds a great amount of charm to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Call me biased but this is the best family Mex restaurant in CenPho. I have dined regularly at Pepe's Taco Villa since 1988, when I started dating one of the true Regulars of Pepe's --  and when Dora Acosta ran the kitchen and made everyone feel welcome. Luz and Jose continue this tradition of hospitality today.

We have gathered there for every type of family occasion from birthdays to graduations to weddings and even memorial. Just call and they will hook you up!

Pepe's is still a popular Sunday evening meeting place for our family scattered across the Valley. Family-friendly is a key note here, but don't discount the place as a Mexican Applebee's. You can still have a great date at night in a booth or hang out with the guys watching sports in the afternoons. Located conveniently along the Light Rail, Pepe's is true destination dining.

We have our favorites, but ask the staff about theirs, first.  

One thing is for sure: you are never guaranteed to get the same salsa twice. This is my indication of fresh ingredients and actual humans in the kitchen instead of prepackaged bags and cans. If the chiles in the salsa are fruitier or smoker on one day or another, I will adjust my order to match. 

When the salsas are spectacularly fruity or sharp with garlic, I'll order the simple crispy chicken tacos, and slather them in whatever pairs best.  If the salsas are just good, I'll order something else that comes with its own heat, like the molé enchiladas. When I'm in a naughty mood I get Tacos Rancheros with a side of sour cream and Pico de Gallo for the table.

The carnitas plate is also special, swimming in sauce.  My husband is in favor of ordering the olla beans as an upgrade from refried. The Tacos Siberia are no joke. And the burrito enchilada style is an Acosta-King family favorite.

Every member of our family has their signature dish, which means there is something for pretty much everyone.  My kid grew up cobbling together his own self-rolled burrito-wraps with a side order of rice and beans. He has since advanced to red enchiladas and burritos enchilada style. Horchata is a favorite palate-pleaser.

That was the long story. Short story? Go!"}
{"text":"When you first walk up, you don't know what you're expecting. But it was a cute Mexican restaurant. The staff was very friendly, the food was good and quick. 
One thing that wasn't the best, was the bathroom. But really that's not a big deal. If you want a good friendly Mexican restaurant, this is the place to go. Amazing menus options as well."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Pepe's for years. The taco siberia and taco monterey are definite high points. The egg/breakfast stuff is also surprisingly good. I don't drink much anymore, but I'd head straight here if I had a hangover. 

P.S. If any of you remember doing a slow burn when Pepe's was cash-only, those days are long gone."}
{"text":"Love this place. Again very sad that I no longer live central. I'm a fan of their huevos rancheros and the Taco Siberia. Love their rice and refrieds too! Staff is extremely friendly and fast. I never had a problem getting in and out within 45 minutes at lunch even when the place was full."}
{"text":"Always friendly, great food, fun atmosphere, great service... they're like extended family!"}
{"text":"Probably in the top 3 Mexican restaurants I've been to in Phoenix.  Everything is authentic and tastes homemade. Chips and salsa are great.  Carne asada is flavorful.  Never had a bad meal here."}
{"text":"Fun and divey atmosphere. Good margaritas and the ground beef taco was really good! Quick and friendly service, I will be back!"}
{"text":"Pretty good. But there are lots of pretty good Mexican joints out there. Green salsa tasty and HOT. Very reasonable, hot tasty food. Red sauce  2-3 stars stick with green sauce. Would stop again if in the area."}
{"text":"Excellent authentic food, Taco Tuesday is a deal! What a great little authentic Mexican meal prepared by Abuellas in the kitchen.  The beef taco as where deep fried to perfection and served with chips and two spicy salsas. The salsa is very hot so be careful.  The restaurant is clean the staff courteous and the prices reasonable."}
{"text":"Wow! Beans and rice are amazing, steak breakfast cooked to perfection, this place is a hidden gem! I was on the area and had time to kill and someone recommended this spot....I may drive out here just to get some good grub!"}
{"text":"Between the service and food five stars. They carry a mole dish, you don't find in many resteraunts. Family owned for 30 years it's a hidden gem. The grandson Eddie hosts as Bar tender server. Be sure to say \"Hi, saw review on. Yelp\" . They have a taco Tuesday for here or to go, a dollar tacos. Don't limit yourself to tacos ALL the food is amazing !"}
{"text":"If you need some delicious authentic Mexican food Pepe's is the place for you.

The Carnitas de Puerco, slow roasted pork in their delicious green sauce is out of this world. The Enchiladas de Pollo con Mole is fantastic too! It seems that if you close your eyes and point you will be rewarded with something incredibly yummy.

If you are tired of the same old chimichangas and the like head over to Pepe's for a taste of Mexico."}
{"text":"Cannot believe it took me 3 years to eat dinner at this restaurant when it's less than half a mile from home. I had their carnitas tacos SOO good! Their homemade salsas are fresh and have excellent flavor. Their staff is attentive, funny and it is a very relaxed atmosphere. Highly recommended if you appreciate delicious homemade Mexican food."}
{"text":"Great service. Jose. Taco Siberia great. However, some of the clients not considerate about other patrons in earshot. Also, a younger employee was behind the bar on his cell and refused to do anything, even when superior got mad at him. Sad."}
{"text":"I will go back when it is not taco Tuesday, but I wasn't impressed. The tacos were greasy, the beef overcooked and there was not much else going on. The chips were thin and greasy and the salsa was watery. 

I know this is a local spot and the place was packed when we went in so I might be missing something? Update to follow if I am brave enough to visit again."}
{"text":"Happy hour Margarita was better than average and cheap. I ordered the mole chicken enchiladas and it came with rice and beans. The actual enchiladas and shredded chicken were cooked well, but the mole sauce was just salty and not sweet enough for my taste. Beans and rice were eh. Chips and salsa were ok. I might come back."}
{"text":"This place is alright but not the greatest. Their barbacoa tacos are very greasy. Their tacos are not authentic tacos in my opinion."}
{"text":"- Great salsa, especially if you mix the red and green together; however, the chips are only mediocre
- Very tasty refried beans
- Amazing chicken mole enchiladas.  That little kick they throw in is outstanding
- The enchiladas suisa were amazing.  Great green chili sauce

I'll be back to sample more of menu."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food in a local family restaurant. I've been going here a few years and I have never had anything less than delicious. Also love taco Tuesday. The staff is friendly and accommodating and will customize your plate to your liking. The Thursday special, green chili short ribs, is outstanding."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday's are the BOMB! I love this place- the food- and everyone that works here!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the Taco Tuesday special..it gets really crowded for dinner, might be tough to find parking. Good atmosphere, they have a cantina with NBA on the TV. I will definitely return to try other menu items!"}
{"text":"TASTY spicy pork taco plate.
Chili Relleno was a little disappointing... too small of a chili inside the egg batter. The sauce was killer, though.

The chips were a little greasy.

The details were all very good, though. The salsas, the rice, the beans... all very well done.

I also had a little taste of their poblano mole... oh yeah... it's good!

The main thing here is probably to order the right thing... the menu is extensive and not all of it is perfect."}
{"text":"Have been coming to Pepe's since I was a kid. 
I have been seeing the current owner since we were kids when she was a teenager and she is still running the place with pride. 
The food is amazing and seriously the best Mexican food you can get in Phoenix. 
I feel that this place will have a line out of the door if it gets some type op hyped up press like pizza Bianca did. 
I highly recommend Pepe's!"}
{"text":"Pepe. Can I call you Pepe? Here's the deal. 
Salsa squeezed out of a bottle. Not so great. It runs all over my plate making it difficult to scoop up. In a bowl or ramekin would be nice. Chips were good however. 

Service. Well. Let's just say I had VIP service as I was with three hot Latinas. Yep. Gay gringo + Hot Latinas = stellar service. Excelente!

Tamales? Why are they a reddish orangey color? Sad. They were dry, not very sweet (like I imagine Nicole Kidman would be) and well, did I mention sad? The pork filling, however was succulent and tasty. Kinda what I imagine Ryan Reynolds would taste like. 

My friend's chicken soup was ORGASMIC. Or as they say in Spanish. ORGASMICO. You see. You just add an O and you're bilingual. Order the soup my yelpitas. Be. The soup. 

And. The margaritas. Well, when you're day drinking and starting at 11:30 am (hey it's 5:00 somewhere, right?) it doesn't take long to catch a buzz. I mean, I''m still tasting my vanilla mint crest with the first sips. But the margs were very smooth, tart and just enough kick.

Cut to me floating in my friends' pool after lunch. Happy. Feliz I should say. But wishing I had stuck with my first choice of carnitas or had ordered the chicken soup. 

Next time. Or. El tiempo proximo. Pepe. I don't care if you're in the hood. I felt so street and edgy. I'll be back. And thank you for commenting on my Hello Kitty debit card Jose! You rawk mi carnes y quesos!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Pepe's for three years and I can not get enough of their fast great service and awesome food. This place is one of my favorites for family dinners!!!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for the best mole' in town, it might just be hiding at Pepe's Taco Villa.
I hadn't been to PTV before (it not really in my neighborhood walking radius...I clock it at just under 22 miles round trip).
It might be worth the trip:)
I've certainly tried the mole's in a lot of places, and some are pretty decent...I know mole' is a style thing, more than an absolute (the \"right\" amount of chocolate...the right \"umami\", etc., so when I say that Los Sombrero's mole' is kind of \"mediocre\" and the mole' at Frank and Lupe's (which used to be pretty decent) would now be better if they just poured a can of unsweetened Hershey's syrup over chicken tartare...you know I mean those minor critiques with love:)
I played squash on Saturday...(squash, the sport of the privileged and effete East Coast elite intelligentsia, who would be dismayed (to put it mildly) to find me playing \"their\" game:)
I played in an event to raise money to make squash an Olympic sport in a few years (yeah, I know...good luck with that, but if they have fencing, why not?)
After playing for over an hour straight (best anaerobic sport on the planet...burns more than 1400 calories an hour)...I was hungry!
My erstwhile opponent, Wes, the affable and probably not corrupt attorney, suggested PTV. 
Wes's wife went to high school with the owners and he said they had great mole's.
3 chicken mole' enchiladas later, I am inclined to agree. 
Wes and the family (I'm like an uncle to those kids...Uncle Buck:) chatted with Jose, one of the owners, when we arrived and I got a chance to say \"hello\" too.
I got a little bit of the history of the place...used to be owned by the parents, used to be smaller and more intimate (something I always like in a taco shop...PTV isn't small any longer).
We got chips and salsa...pretty good chips and better salsas, although the 2 kinds of salsa came in squeeze bottles (I am really more of a \"dunker\" than \"squeezer\" when it comes to salsa...it was fine...you just have to make a little volcano of both kinds of salsa and use 2 chips to push things around...but I don't really like to have to work the chip thing that hard:)
The enchiladas came and heavens to murgatroid, they were tasty!!! 
Pronounced chocolate flavor, not too salty, with the just the right amount of bitterness from the unsweetened Mexican chocolate:) The chocolate blended with the grilled chicken flavor and the sweetness of the corn tortillas to produce an outstanding enchilada. 
I also ordered the Olla beans...highly recommended! 
You can get refries anywhere and I doubt that PTV's are significantly (or any) better than others. 
But they put a bunch of jalapeno's in the pot to make these pot beans a cut above the rest:)
They say that chocolate accesses the same brain chemistry that sex does, and I think that might have been the case with my enchilada's:)
But, I was there with Wes and his family...they were kind enough to invite me along and show me where to get good mole'...a full on foodgasm would have just been wrong...even for me:)"}
{"text":"So we were walking down the road to Country Boys for dinner and I happened to notice this place and remember that I read about this place on yelp and wanted to try it. So we decided to stop here instead. This is a nice little place just off of 19th and Camelback, headed towards the 17. There is a lot of different things on the menu, and it took me a while to choose (like usual) but I did know I wanted an horchata. And it was great. Sometimes the horchata is really watery or the flavor was off, but this was perfect. I ended up getting a chile relleno because of the suggestion they made, as well as the combination plate of a chicken taco, a tostada, and a enchilada served with rice and beans on the side. My dinner companion got the 3 quesadilla plate that included rice and beans as well. The chile relleno was wow... I have never had it before so I can't compare it, but I can definitely tell why this a favorite. That alone is pretty filling. The tostada was nice kinda crunchy but not overly so, piled with lettuce and tomato on top of beans. I wasn't expecting it to be as good as it was. The chicken taco was filled with shredded chicken that was very flavorful, lettuce, tomato, and cheese. It was pretty good, and the enchilada was even better. Yummy cheese inside of a tortilla topped with yummy sauce. The beans were whatever..... average refried beans, and the rice was pretty good. The quesadillas were slightly crunchy filled with yummy mozzarella cheese. The awesome thing about this place, besides just the food, is the awesome customer service.... they're awesome always checking up on us, and they are a family owned business, for over 30 years, and the mother who started the restaurant still comes in every morning to check up and make sure everything is fresh and being made right. The lovely eating companion says it tastes like authentic Mexican food, and I just know that it tastes great. For all the food and drinks it was just under $30. Definitely check it out."}
{"text":"My husband and dined on Saturday and the staff is fun, the portions are huge, and the food is tasty!  Came again on Wednesday and the food is so fresh and delicious. I highly recommend anyone who loves Mexican to give Pepe's a shot!"}
{"text":"Late lunch on Cinco de Mayo at Pepe's Taco Villa. Special ordered Mexican Pizza with carnitas, instead of ground beef. Was a meal in itself. The pizza was tasty with tomato, yellow and white cheese, jalapeno. Good for two slices...the rest boxed it to go. If watching cholesterol...may want to skip this one! 

Also had the barbacoa beef burro with onion, celantro and jalapeno. The beef was exceptional, very tender, juicy and perfectly seasoned. Almost creamy with the tortilla...happy on the taste buds. This one is #35 of the menu. 

Have been here twice. Previously had chicken enchiladas with a  mole sauce (chocolate, chili, and many other ingredients). Authentic food, great service, reasonable prices, unique decor. They also have $1 Taco Tuesday! Family owned business...started in 1981. Got this one bookmarked as a favorite."}
{"text":"I went here with my buddy for Taco Tuesday. We had tacos and margaritas and they were both delicious. Really authentic Mexican food and the happy hour was super affordable. The margaritas actually got me drunk. They don't skip on the tequila."}
{"text":"Been eating here for over 15 years.  Always good quality homemade food.  Very affordable and great service always aa well!!"}
{"text":"Good food,  friendly staff and good prices.  Only negative I have is the 8pm close time. At least be open later on Friday and Saturday."}
{"text":"Great staff and really good food. My wife loved her margarita and I loved the horchata. Been there several times and will keep going back."}
{"text":"The food is alright, when I say alright I mean the salt shaker moved around the table like a pawn on a chessboard.  It's pretty basic Mexican food. The service is fantastic, they treated me like an out of state college student returning home for winter break."}
{"text":"What a great spot for some home-style tacos. Their menu is full of tantalizing options and the chips and salsa are amazing too. Service was very attentive and the food was piping hot when delivered. I'll be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Cute cute little find. Always order big lunch orders from here for work and they always provide good fast service. Good quality meat, super important for my picky co-worker. Beef Chimi is my favorite and I eat it all- it's huge. Quesadilla is super yummy also huge remember sharing is caring. Plus side - sells alcohol down side bad bathrooms."}
{"text":"ode to a Chilaquiles.

so i ate some Chilaquiles at Pepe's the other morning. not ever having Chilaquiles before i was not sure if my Chilaquiles was good or great, but the Chilaquiles was good to me. very tasty Chilaquiles that is. i had my Chilaquiles with hard fried eggs because i'm not a fan of runny yoke. my Chilaquiles egg was only 85% to my requested hard fried, resulting in a missing star. tho my Chilaquiles was very good. my Chilaquiles was made with a tomatoes salsa texture of sauce..watery in a way..but not knowing how Chilaquiles should look..i thought it was good. Chilaquiles.

the tortilla chips are also good. and i kinda liked the squeeze bottles. cause i just squeeze it onto a chip and put it in my mouth. tasty salsas..i squirted a bunch onto my Chilaquiles egg that wasn't fried enough..so i didn't notice the runny texture. Chilaquiles. Chilaquiles. the beans with my Chilaquiles had white cheese on them, alot of mexican restuarants use a handful of yellow cheese so i was impressed..it wasn't crumble queso-fresco..but it was still tasty with my Chilaquiles. Chilaquiles.


ok i think i have used Chilaquiles eighteen times now..umm ok nineteen times...so to finish off with an even twenty...Chilaquiles. yummm. ohh btw they take bank cards now."}
