{"text":"Cruising thru and hungry had a late night (8pm)  fix for some tacos or mariscos and the place across the street was packed.

Well first good sign I see was Hotdogs estilo Cd Obregon. Knowing exactly what real hotdogs taste like from Sonora we got 2. We noticed they had caldo de Cahuamata but lady said it was their specialty so we got 2. This is our new spot thoroughly enjoyed authentic Sonoran flavors!

Sonora style hotdogs 4/5: needed beans and green chili sauce but better than most places Ive tasted

Caldo de Cahuamanta 5/5: Wow it was not prefrozen fish and had a good ratio of seafood to soup. It was spot on

Aguas de Jamaica 5/5: Made fresh not powder and not watered down"}
{"text":"Came on a Sunday evening and wondered if it was open since it was empty.  Service by the waitress could have been much better even for a $ restaurant. Ordered the cebada drink but they did not have any. Asked for a glass of water but they only had bottled so I took it. I had Carne asada tacos and cabeza. The tortillas for the former were dry and so was the meat. The cabeza was Okay and the corn tortillas were made here so it helped although not enough to receive any more then a single star."}
{"text":"Came to this place looking for good tacos and Authenic cahuamanta soup. This place definitely has some mouth watering dishes. Btw gotta try the homeade corn and flour tortillas."}
