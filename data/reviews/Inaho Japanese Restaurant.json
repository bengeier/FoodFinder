{"text":"One of the best Jap restaurants in Richmond Hill with the freshest fish. Very high quality fish that almost melts in your mouth. The shrimp sashimi is a MUST try - best I've had within GTA. It's a very small restaurant (around 6 tables + the sushi bar) so it's not great for big parties. The only thing I have to complain about is the price. You wouldn't expect a little casual restaurant like this in Richmond Hill to be so expensive. We paid around $40 per person and unfortunately were not full after the meal (36pcs of sushi/sashimi/maki + 3pcs of shrimp sashimi). The quality is there, but the price is also way up there."}
{"text":"My family's favourite Japanese restaurant. Come here probably at least once a month in more recent times, but we've been coming here for 16 years. The service is a little slow given it is just a married couple running the restaurant that accommodates approx. 20 (give or take)people, I can assure you however that the dishes here are delicious and well worth the wait."}
{"text":"The price is high for what you're getting, both quality and quantity. The shrimp tempura udon that I ordered had no flavoring, only 2 pieces of shrimp, and I've been to cheaper ayce places with better quality. It was $12.50 and not filling.
The food also took very long. My friend ordered a delux 16 piece sushi that is over $20 and took more than 1 hour. I would not come again."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi.  Small restaurant so make a reservation or get there early.  One of the few restaurants where the sushi chef is Japanese."}
{"text":"We tried to go to this place last weekend but by the time we called to make a reservation, they were already full for the night. finally we got a reservation and i was excited about trying this place.

We ordered a sushi deluxe, bento box 1, a negi hama roll, and a japanese potatoe with tuna sashimi appetizer. the meals came with salad and miso soup. 

Frankly, the sushi was very unimpressive. First of all, not all the sushi looked fresh. The hamachi sushi had already gone bad. The Salmon roe sushi literally looked milky. It's usually bright orange and transparent, but these were murky and the roes looked dry. I didn't even eat that piece. On top of that very obviously not fresh piece of sushi, every other piece that i ate from that plate had a soapy taste. I thought it was just me, so i told my bf to try a piece, and he also tasted the soap. I'm guessing they didn't rinse off the plate properly after washing. The sushi rice was also packed too tightly, kinda felt like i was chewing thru a brick when i was eating. 

On a brighter note, the Tempura that came with the bento box was pretty good. It was very lightly battered, and there was a good variety of vegetables. Negi hama roll was excellent, and the japanese potatoe with tuna sashimi appetizer was also good. 

Maybe i would come back here for the tempura, but i would stay away from the sushi."}
{"text":"Best hole in the wall for fresh sashimi and green tea ice cream. I used to come here 10+ years ago and visited again recently. Quality is still just as good, however the prices seem to have gone up. 

I got the sashimi deluxe ($42), which came with 4 pieces each of salmon, red tuna, butterfish, hamachi, octopus and a white fish that I couldn't identify (snapper? Sea bream?). The sashimi pieces were the thickest I've seen anywhere and practically melted in my mouth. All very fresh. At first I didn't think that it would be worth the price, but it was.

Their green tea ice cream is also notable. Unlike a lot of other places, their ice cream is made in house and the matcha flavour is one of the strongest I've tasted. It's not too sweet and but still creamy.

Other dishes I've tried recently are the avocado salad, sushi pizza and the gyu don. All good, except I found the beef in the gyu don to be dry. They give a much more generous portion of beef than places like Donburi and Moji though. 

Like other yelpers have said, the restaurant is small and run by a sushi chef and his wife is the only server, so service is a bit slow. Make sure to make a reservation."}
{"text":"this place is the definition of mom and pop store. It's a very small store and they serve good quality food. It's very home-y style (I've seen regulars refill their tea themselves with hot water - not out of frustration with the slow service, but because they are comfortable). It should be noted that they use good quality tea and regular refill the pot so you're not just drinking tea flavoured water. Also of note is the miso soup. It won't make you feel like you are going to OD on sodium, and actually tastes like something. 

Their crispy rolls were also actually crispy. A lot of places serve you rolls that have been sitting around and the filling is only marginally crunchy. The tempura bits they use here are super fresh. 

As other reviews have noted, the service can be slow because the place is literally run by 2 people (including the chef - they are husband and wife) but they serve good quality food and this is as low scale/neighbourhood friendly as it gets. It has also been around for a long time, so that is always a good sign."}
{"text":"Service can be a bit slow but we don't mind at all.  
Sushi and Sashimi are alway fresh and delicious.  
Their salad dressing tasted a bit different than before but it was still good and fresh.  

NOTE: They are going to close from June 18 to July 17, 2014 for vacation and will re-open on July 18."}
{"text":"** REVIEWER'S CHOICE **

\"The one with the many business cards (left by guests) plastered all over all the wall.\"

The Good:
Fresh, high-quality sushi; relatively fast and polite service; affordable lunch menu for those who want to spend less than $10; 

The Bad:
A little cramped inside with limited seating

Overview:
For those of you looking for high-quality sushi around the Richmond Hill area (Highway 7 and Leslie area), look no further. Yes, you can go for Miyabi's for that oh-so-delicious and authentic sushi and but is it worth the 1-2 hour wait and the $18? Most people would say \"you get what you pay for\", but if you're like me and you don't have that much time to kill plus you don't want to spend ~$18 for a lunch that doesn't necessarily fill you, then you should definitely try Inaho where you get a much better bang for your buck. The fish at Inaho is prepared fresh and I would say the quality is nearly indistinguishable from Miyabi's, but for the money (and time) you save, you definitely get more. 

I recommend the Chirashi, which is a traditional Japanese entree where an assortment of freshly cut fish is served over white rice in a traditional small box. After taxes and tips it comes out to about $14-$16, slightly less than Miyabi but you definitely get a lot more and you don't have to wait forever for it to get there. Their lunch menu is pretty good to, tailored towards people like my friends who tag along but don't want to break a $20 on lunch. They have the typical Chicken/Beef Teriyaki's as well as some Katsu's and so forth. Quality of these are pretty good and portions are just right. These Teriyaki and Katsu entrees come on a plate and come with a bowl of rice, a green salad and a miso soup. Certainly not bad for ~$8 taxes and tips in. 

There's usually just the same woman that works there and she's really nice and responsive. She remembers things and is pretty quick. The restaurant itself may seem a little cramped though and there certainly aren't many tables. There are about 6-8 tables that can seat 4 people at most if I remember correctly, so this place may not be the best for parties. They also have that bench seating alongside where the chef prepares the sushi, similar to a \"sushi bar\". One funny thing I noted on our first try is that they have on the wall near the washroom a wall of business cards from visitors. I was bored and looked at a few and saw many people from across the world leaving their mark (I recognized someone's card from where I work, from the Japan team!)

Overall, definitely my choice for sushi in the Highway 7 area. We go time and time again and it's always our first choice when one of us goes: \"I'm in the mood for some sushi...and NO, not that instant stuff from T&T...I want some high quality sushi.\"

{"text":"A nice change from the surrounding ACYE. This place is authentic. The chef is Japanese. The server is a Chinese lady, the wife so I've been told. 
Loved the food. I can tell each piece of sushi was made with care. The vinegared rice was just right. The tuna / salmon maki is a must try. So simple, yet so good.
this place is a little pricier than surrounding restaurants, but justified for quality of fish. Paid $45 for two people ( no alcohol )."}
{"text":"I'm very particular about my sushi so I was pretty skeptical when my friends took me to Inaho. 

The first thing I noticed when I walked in was that the restaurant was very small (could fit 20-30 people maximum). However, the small size of the place also gave it a cozy, \"family\" atmosphere. A lot nicer on the inside than it looks from the outside.

I ordered the boat for 2 people which came with 6 types of sashimi, 6 types of sushi, 3 rolls and complementary salad and miso soup. On the whole, the food was good. The sashimi especially was great - it was fresh and thick. The fish on the sushi was a little bit too thin for my liking but it was still nice. The rolls were average - it wasn't bad but they were quite small. The boat was about $65 after tax which was quite pricey compared to the small serving size. 

There was only 1 server and 1 chef which meant that service was extremely slow. We had to wait around 1-2 hours for our food and my miso soup was cold by the time I got my first platter of sushi. Even trying to get a refill on the tea took a long time because there was only 1 server trying to accommodate the 20-30 people at the restaurant. I think the wait time for food is the major downside to Inaho. 

Overall, Inaho was a good experience but I don't really have any incentive to come back. Don't get me wrong, the food was good. However, I've had better sushi for cheaper and with faster service."}
{"text":"This small little hidden restaurant is a gem. Own by a couple, Japanese husband as chef, and Cantonese wife. This place always have fresh sashimi and sushi. Today's special is always nice choice. Their tempera is a must try. Batter is nice, light and crisp. From cooked foods to raw, Inaho is amazing. It's a little pricy, but it's worth it in Markham."}
{"text":"Inaho is a small family ran business with the Japanese husband as the chef and his wife as the waiter. Pricing is really reasonable with the amount of food you get. 

We ordered a sushi boat and a negi hama roll which did take at least half an hour for the boat to come to the table. Presentation of the boat was really plain but the sushi was amazing. The fish was really fresh and the rice had just the right amount of vinegar in it and the size of it was just right. Their Tamago (Egg) was the best I've eaten in years. Despite it is a plain type of sushi, their Tamago was just the right taste and hardness. It was just the right hardness, not to stiff, not to soft. 

I would definitely recommend to make a reservation if you plan to go there during the evening or during the lunch rush. Place has limited tables and usually once full will not really accept more people cause they do take a long time to have to food out to their customers. 

This restaurant is definitely a sure-go you would want to go back for more after your first try."}
{"text":"This is a rare family ran Japanese restaurant in the area. An older couple manages the place and has a homie feeling. I really enjoy their soup based dishes, and you must get their caterpillar roll, even better if you get the chance to see the chef make it. He is very delicate with the details! If you are looking for fancy sushi and lots of variety this may not be the place, but if you want something cozy and food that's made with heart this is the place!"}
{"text":"I've been here once, and would definitely not come back.
The waitress is married to the sushi chef - they are the only two working in the restaurant.  It's genuine Japanese food (as he is Japanese, but she is Chinese).

Because of the lack of staff, the wait time for anything is so long.  The food is average, it's definitely not worth going out of your way for.

I remember it took close to an hour for our entrees to come.  I ordered a chicken terriyaki - it was alright, but more expensive than most places.

I came back another time, but we were turned away, as we hadn't made a reservation.  I have no idea why I went back a second time, I think because my parents like it.  But will convince them never to come back."}
{"text":"This little gem was a bit hard to find at first. But this mom and pop store is different than other stores I have been to. Kitchen is manned by the chef/husband and everything is the wife's territory. I like this setup, very home feel. 

Food wise, quite exquisite. The eel bomb is very different take on unagi sushi. Very tasty! I also had their hamachi, very sweet and fresh. Also try the negi hama maki roll, the green onion with diced up hamachi is yummy indeed. Fish is indeed fresh. 

Only down side slower service cause only 2 persons run this place. But I am sure to say the food offsets the service times. Must try!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Jap sushi restaurant.  Operated by a couple, Owner/Chef is Japanese, and technique is very professional.

The miso soup is one of the best i have had, not sure if it is homemade, since most Jap restaurant just uses packs bought from supermarket

Udon is my girlfriend's favorite, clear, lightly flavored soup, but yet it is very tasteful.  I have always been a sushi/sashimi freak, the sushi is nicely molded, fish is fresh and also very \"fat\", sushi is big in size, great in taste, and yet the quality is very professional.  sesame Ice-cream is my favorite, which was told it is home made, and very limited, highly recommended.

As Simon have mentioned, this place is a little cramped, and I would also add is, when it's crowded, the wait time is also lengthened, due to fact there are only 2 people cooking and serving, so expect delays when it is normal Lunch/Dinner hours.

But overall it is one of the best Japanese restaurant i come across around the area, its always a place for option when I option for dinner locations."}
{"text":"This can not be a 4 star restaurant. It's pricey for the quality. Not much but not a 4 star. I order a sashimi on rice $19 which is little over price because the over of this food is dry. The fish isn't that fresh and eye seeing. The miso soup had a funny taste to it. The salad was good. The service is very slow because the waitress is by herself. I think I'm almost full. The most I can give is a 3 star ."}
{"text":"A bit of a strange mish mash establishment in my opinion. The restaurant is basically a husband (Japanese) and wife (Chinese) - 2 man show. The sushi and raw dishes were made by the husband and very good and authentic, however the cooked dishes we ordered came with Chinese style sides and tasted a bit bland. The wife is both cook and waitress which makes the service quite slow. 

The tempura and sushi pizza items were a bit greasy, and the udon noodles and broth had a more Chinese soy flavour. 

There was Chinese tv on in the background and the other tables of customers all seemed to know each other and the owners very well... It was almost like being at someone's home more than a restaurant. Some of the dishes were cracked and the plastic Japanese style ones were chipping off in colour. It was also overpriced for what we got and for the lack of ambience. 

Maybe it was better in the past or it was an off night, but Dont think we'll be returning to this one.

 2.5 stars."}
{"text":"I don't think I've ever given such a low review for a sushi place before. The food was decent but the hour long wait for the food is ridiculous. We came in right when the dinner shift started and we order in fifteen minutes. Two of my friend got their food but mine didn't come, but other people came in and got their food before me. Eventually we had to go and my food still did not arrive but when we asked the waitress they brought it right away but it was still over an hour too late. Sushi was not bad, though the rest of the food was mediocre, but I definitely won't go there again."}
{"text":"Overall I would recommend this restaurant based on the freshness of the ingredients and services. Although the selection of sashimi is limit, its fresh. 

There is one special roll called Cultus Rl (10piece) rice paper shrimp tempura spicy tuna crabmeat mango spring greens avocado cucumber amazing taste"}
{"text":"This homey Japanese restaurant has been a family staple since childhood. Even after I moved away from this neighbourhood, we still come back to have dinner here. The place is run by the nicest elderly couple, and their food is great! They do a great grilled Saba and their sushi rolls and sashimi are fresh and on point, too! My family also loves their futomaki rolls, and we haven't found another place that can replicate it! For a warm and friendly experience that encapsulates the Japanese idea of wabi sabi, go to Inaho!"}
{"text":"Went there with a friend on a Thursday night. The place was full but they were all middle-aged customers. For some reasons my instincts told me something was a little not right. I got a theory for this phenomenon included at the end of the review.

We were served by a middle-aged waitress. Actually, she was the only server there. Not a smile the whole time. According to other reviews, apparently she is the owner-wife of the restaurant. Basically, she took our order, gave us the food, refilled our tea once, and took our payment at the end. Besides refilling our tea once, it was nothing different than eating at a food court. Not sure how other reviewers called this restaurant \"homey\".

Like other reviewers said, the food was quite pricey. I did not expect that kind of pricing for this interior design. Oh, and I really hated that wall taped with all those business cards from different real estate agents, bankers, companies, markets etc. Some of the business cards already turned yellow. It reminded me when I first immigrated to Calgary 25 years ago, a lot of Asian restaurants at that time loves to do that. For whatever reasons.

I almost always order Chirashi in a Japanese restaurant. But seeing it being $29.50 on the menu and the boring sashimi selections they give you from other customer's photos, I decided to pass on that.

Their menu was quite boring. Very typical sushi, rolls, sashimi, but with higher-than-normal price. I ordered a dragon maki and my friend ordered an eel maki. Since they only had 1 sushi chef, whom other reviewers stated he is the owner-husband, my friend's eel maki took them around 45mins to serve and my dragon maki took another 15mins. I did check my watch as we were both amazed at the long waiting time. Finally our 2 rolls came 1 hour after we ordered. During the time, we weren't updated why was it taking so long nor apologized for the long wait. Like, I understand that you only had 1 chef. But on the customer's view, I don't think it is reasonable to have waited 1 hour for just 2 maki.

Speaking of their roll, despite the cuteness in that dragon maki, as you can see their ingredients were few. I have not had a maki with so few ingredients in the middle ever from a Japanese restaurant. Same goes to my friend's eel maki. I sure do expect more ingredients when I pay $13.50 and $12.50 for rolls.

Because of this bad experience, I won't go again and I won't recommend this restaurant to my friends or anyone. I saw some reviewers called it a hidden gem. Well yes it is quite hidden in the city, but I don't think it's a gem.

PS.
I have a theory behind why it was filled with middle-aged customers: this restaurant was opened long time ago when Japanese restaurants were few in the city. So old immigrants have been going to this restaurant for a long time. Just like my parents, they only know the same few restaurants in GTA unless their kids bring them to new ones. So they keep coming back if they wanted Japanese food, making this restaurant seems like a popular place."}
{"text":"Small cozy family run Japanese restaurant.

Udon with fishcake, veggie, sunny side up egg and shrimp tempura $13.95 - tasted very good. The udon noodles had a nice chew to it and the soup tasted great. Only complaint is that it came with one single shrimp tempura. 

Salmon teriyaki box $13.50 - comes with salad, miso soup, a spring roll, two shrimp tempura's, veggie tempura, white rice and the salmon. Everything tasted good and very fresh. Only complaint is that I would rather have a bento box which had some sushi combined with it.

Since none of the above had sushi with it we also got the Eel bomb sushi roll for $12.50 - BBQ eel on the inside of the roll and on the outside. Tasted great with a good portion of BBQ eel. No complaints on this one. 

I felt the price is a bit on the high side but you do get really good quality."}
{"text":"Came here for takeout lunch and I haven't been here in a long time. Coming back after years its still a decent place despite that when I came in almost all the tables were uncleaned from previous customers and the staff didn't have the time to clean up.. So it felt a bit dirty to sit at a table waiting for my takeout when you can't help but see a half eaten piece of terayaki or chewed up and spat out piece of beef cuz it was not that soft... 

Anyho.. I ordered chicken katsu. It was decent. Since I'm kinda critical on my katsu and I'm always on a lookout for good katsu and I know when I have a bad one. The sauce was a bit small for my liking and the crunch factor was just average. Wasn't overly crunchy or else I would know its just all breading.. But overall the chicken katsu was just OK.. Nothing too special nor amazing price wise it wasn't that cheap either after tax and all almost $9.. Pretty pricy for katsu IMO..

Service wasn't very fast either when there wasn't much people at the time so I can just wonder how its like when its peak hours...  Maybe one day I'll be back, but won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Our waitress was very polite but this is the only nice thing I can say about Inaho. We came here for dinner and ordered a sushi/ sashimi boat set for 2 people. The fish was not as fresh as we expected. The food is average and the portions are on the smaller side-- not worth the price, especially for that location. Incredibly disappointing, will not be back."}
{"text":"The food is not bad but for that price, it's not worth it. I have had better sushi and sashimi don than that."}
{"text":"I rarely give a 5 star... but there it is.
The place is small... humble setting.
Dont go there if you are looking for a rowdy time and lould atmosphere.
It seems the diners are very respectful and rush service is not what they are there for.
They are there for the GREAT food experience.

The prices are fair.  
We ordered Gyoza which were freshly made.  Filling to nice skin texture and gently pan fried.  Ponzo sauce to compliment the great dumplings.  5 poeces per order and left me wanting more.
Salmon sushi... I have to say... fish to rice portion was spot on.
If you have read any reviews of mine and places I have been... I know my sushi.  This place nailed it!  Great quality and served perfectly.
They ran out of Flying fiah roe... , the Salmon roe sushi was good.
Rolls that we ordered was Eel Bomb, Spider and FutoMaki... All huge and perfect!  
Complimentary ice cream... choice of Green Tea, Black Sesame and another I cant remember.  I picked Black Sesame and I am hooked!!!
The tea was great... and feel free to ask for a pot for the table.

I believe that ita ran by a couple... husband behind the sushi counter and wife as server.
Great combo!

My friend was sick... from earlier and I had to go in asking for some Kleenex and water.
The lady gave me a bottle of water and said take the whole box of kleenex. 
I took what i needed for kleenex and the bottle water.  Humbled by the genorosity.
She said to come back for anything else I needed.

That is true service and though this place is a hike from Brampton... I will be back.

So in closing... if you want your money worth on great sushi.... come here.
Great find!"}
{"text":"If you got time to waste, then you can dine here.   My client suggested for us to come here for lunch and we literally waited 30 mins for our food.  

Inaho is a mom and pop shop ran by an older gentleman who is also the sushi chef and an older lady who is the only server.  I understand the delay is due to human resource capacity and the server was very apologetic but waiting half hour for food is simply too long for a lunch meeting.  Aside from the wait, I have no other complaints. The food was good and the price is fair. 

I ordered the eel and avo and F14 roll.  The sushi rice on the rolls was a bit loose, not very sticky so it kept falling into pieces as I grab it with my chopsticks but it's not a big deal. The F14 roll was delicious with a deep fried inner layer. Pretty creative and tasty.  I would recommend that."}
{"text":"Hidden gem located in a commercial building that would definitely go unnoticed but found it on Yelp.  Came here recently on a Friday night at around 6:30pm and it was quiet but all the tables had reserved on it.  It's a very small place so be sure to make reservations.

There was a good selection of traditional Japanese food.  We ordered the house-made gyoza, grilled eggplant to start, regular sashimi dinner, eel bomb and the Katsu don.  Although the prices were high for some dishes, overall we thought it was pretty reasonable.  The small appetizers were about $6 and donburi (meat on rice bowls) around $13 are good prices.  And the sashimi was really good quality so I don't mind paying a little more.

We are definitely adding this place to our list of go to places for Japanese food.  Can't wait to come back and try other dishes."}
{"text":"I think their don katsu is one of the best around here. (not comparable to Hawaii but the price is not in the same league either).

Yummy pork don katsu. The service is a little slow so as long as you are not in a rush. Think its a family business. Make reservations as sometimes they can't handle the rush."}
{"text":"For this season...no...scratch that...for this entire YEAR, I had the BEST salmon sashimi and hamachi sashimi ever in the GTA area. The prices per plate are about ten bucks more than the average sushi restaurant, but I highly recommend everyone to cut back on a few lattes and save that money to eat at this Japanese restaurant. The sushi chef is Japanese, the restaurant is very small and not well air-conditioned on a hot day, but if my Spidey senses tell me that the table beside us are Japanese businessmen who are telling the chef the food is oishii...I definitely know I've found a gem for quality fish in the area, and for me it is well worth the five stars.

Tip: come on a weekday and try 830pm. Or else there won't be seating. If there's a wait, go next door to Marathon for a tea and come back, they don't mind if you brought a drink from outside since they knew you were waiting."}
{"text":"Complete trash. Food is over priced. Service is terrible. Huge language barrier. They do an excellent job reminding you that your business is not wanted.  Pretty sure the waiting staff is racist as well."}
{"text":"Inaho Japanese restaurant is more reasonable priced than the other Japanese owned Miyabi Japanese Restaurant a couple minute drive away. http://www.yelp.ca/biz/miyabi-japanese-restaurant-richmond-hill

Why the comparison as they are both small, intimate and the few that has real Japanese chef at the sushi bar and the kitchen in the area.

The selections are traditional Japanese with a few special rolls. They also have a board up on the wall announcing today specials. There are also bento lunch box, sushi set for lunch $9 and up.

Tempura Udon ($9)
- The udon noodle are thick and chewy with a lot of texture. Nice touch with the veggie in the udon broth! The only thing is I found the broth maybe flavoured with MSG or other enchancer why?? I was so thirsty after drinking some of the broth.....usually that's my body telling me I have a high dose of something that is not good for me. - 0.5 star
-Tempura has a nice mixed of veggie (beans, yam, eggplants, pumpkin) and 2 shrimps. A little bit oily (a lot of residue oil on the layer), the batter is quite light and flavoured. A-OK

Boston Maki ($6.50)
- Sushi Rice is used for the maki. The rice is though cooked bit mushy not all of them retained the round, fluffy, whole grain. But The rolls were rolled perfectly with the nice balance of flying fish roe, avocado, salmon and lettuce. Nice touch of finishing the roll with white and black seasames on the outside.

Love the tableware and the presentation of all the dishes. Care has been made in selecting nice Japanese ware to enchanced the whole eating experience. 

BTW, the lone waitress here is Cantonese speaking and only herself working the busy lunch area, the service can be a little slow and lacking.

I will definitely comes back to try other things on the menu... especially  their fresh fish offering!"}
{"text":"I would give it 3.5, pretty fresh sushi and with reasonable price,  however pls call on advance to reserve a table, it is always full"}
