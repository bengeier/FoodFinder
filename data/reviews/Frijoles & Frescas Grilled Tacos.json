{"text":"Far from authentic Mexican food. Lack of flavor in the asada and Pico de gallo was real disappointing considering the 4.5 star rating. Chips were fresh but so are bagged chips....Dios mio!"}
{"text":"EAT HERE. NOW!! Definitely the best (and freshest) Mexican food I've ever had. Coming from San Diego (where taco shops are plentiful) my fiancé and I were eager to find some yummy Mexican food. Needless to say, we did. Prices are SUPER reasonable - my fiancé and I shared a chicken salad and two frescas for $12 and change. The chicken salad is enough to share, and the drinks tasted super fresh. I got a spinach and pineapple one and my fiancé got a strawberry mango. Great service and beautiful interior as well! We'll definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"My favorite taco place.
If you wanna have a really good cocktail shrimp, this is the place. Their pollo salad it's the best ever. Their green salsa it's one of a kind!!!!"}
{"text":"If you like bland food then yaaaasssssss this is the place for you!!!! Cover that shizzznitttt with different hot sauces because that's as much flavor as you'll get. Either way super bummed considering the good reviews. I knew I should have walked out after I saw one whole section of nothing but dirty tables but I was already at the hangry stage so I sat my chunky butt down and ate it $30 for two people no thanks never again I'll stick to these fast food 4 for $4 you see all over the commercials."}
{"text":"I was in the area with my family and was looking for a place to eat. This place came across and it was really yummy. I ordered a shrimp quesadilla. It was stuffed with a good amount of jumbo shrimps, cheese and grilled veggies. It was delish. I added a cucumber with chia water (Fresca) . Not disappointed and the staff was all courteous."}
{"text":"The food is satisfactory. It fills one stomach. The burritos are decent fulfilling. The horchata was too sweet with cinnamon. Unfortunately the men's bathroom was not that clean and didn't have soap."}
{"text":"Amazing little tacos.  We tried almost every type of mini taco and all of them were delicious.  Best chicken taco I've had.  The meat was cooked fresh, cut in perfect size pieces, and slightly crisp, but not too crispy.  This place is highly recommended for decent prices, great food, and nice, clean ambiance."}
{"text":"Their food has good seasoning and the meat does not feel dry. I love the drinks they have. I would recommend this place if your looking for a quick bite that has flavor."}
{"text":"This place does street style corn better than I've ever had! I've even had park street corn from a guy with a cart and a bike horn and this place blew it away! I stopped in for a quick bite, ordered two carne asada tacos and the corn. The steak was delicious! Much better than the chewy stuff at other places. I didn't have time to try a specialty fruit drink but the staff was friendly and patient as they let a lady sample all of them...SMH. This place has charm, they're slogan suggests they have a sense of humor (How you bean?), and they close on Sunday keeping the Sabbath day holy! Great place, I can't wait to go back with my wife and kids! Nice job Arturo Trejo!"}
{"text":"i didn't leave a scrap of my huge order including the chips, salsa and guac! 
(plus to go fried ice cream)
i even had the street corn which i admit is a delicious if not an acquired taste...i will get it again but a second maybe more traditional version would be great. 
i will be back, hungry for more!"}
{"text":"This is the real deal. I ordered the number one which was a taco with your choice of meat and rice and beans. I opted for asada. The taco had tomato, guacamole and cheese and two tortillas. The tacos are grilled so the tortilla is a bit crispy. The meat was seasoned with salt and had a simple delicious flavor. Now let's talk about the rice and beans. This is a staple in most Mexican restaurants. I am quite picky because my Mom has delighted me with savory rice and well-cooked beans my whole life. I am usually prepared to be disappointed with most restaurants. Well the rice was flavorful and the beans were delicious. These are not the beans from a can that are dark and whipped topped with shredded cheese. These looked like peruano beans. They were perfectly seasoned and were creamy but not completely smashed. Reminded me of home. I also ordered an agua de limon which was perfectly refreshing. The only thing that did not blow my socks off were the salsas. It may be a matter of preference though. I don't like cumin in my salsa and I could detect it in both the red and green salsas. I definitely plan to visit this place again when I get the chance."}
{"text":"Frijoles y Fresca needs to step up their game with the freshness! I ordered four Pastores four Carnitas and four Carne Asada tacos and they were all warm and the meat was not fresh. The salsa is burnt the tacos uncooked. Pineapples were not fresh on tacos. 
In my opinion the best place for Pastor tacos is eL pastor Cito on East Charleston just west of tacos el gordo."}
{"text":"Delicioso!!!! 

My family and I went with another family. I had a crane asada salad that I loved! The rice and beans in the salad were delightful, and the steak was flavorful! My friend had the pork salad, and she enjoyed it too. 

Two people in my party had crane asada tacos. One had mini tacos and the other had the regular tacos. The guy who had mini tacos said they reminded him of the tacos he had when he lived in Mexico. My husband had the regular tacos, which were far from regular. They had rice, beans, pico, and guac with the meat. 

The kids in our group had nachos. We also ordered chips and salsa and guac. Everything was delectable and reasonably priced. We're just visiting Vegas, but this will be our regular stop when we do. We're going again before we head home!"}
{"text":"This place could use some additional side orders, as EVERY time I ask for extra \"Pico de Gallo\" on the side or in addition, they don't include it in the \"to-go\" order. The beans are too watery and leak in the take out bags."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem if you are out of town. Delicious homemade food at a great price with great service. Do not pass this place up."}
{"text":"I love this place! too bad its closed on Sundays!

Everything I have tried is delicious! Burritos, Nachos (OMG), street tacos, regular tacos, salads, shrimp cocktail, the corn is AMAZING! you ask for the corn to be shaved in a bowl, which reduces messiness. My office catered it in one day and everyone loved it! its way better than chipotle food, however i don't think its as healthy.

they also have a different variety of drinks/waters. The lemon chia is my favorite. Def try it!"}
{"text":"Awesome yummy food! The yummy food tastes so good in the belly. Came back for a second time in a week! The Aqua Fresca Strawberry/Mango/Horchata tastes so refreshing. The kids loved the kids food. The meat was flavored just right. There needs to be more Arturo Trejo. Seriously? Where are the posters of Arturo? Get on that!"}
{"text":"The food  is bad!! My 5 year old got food poisoning from this awful place. I should of called the health department. The food was so terrible and old! They must of cooked my sons food with old grease. The avocado was brown. The corn on the cob was also brown and old. I'm disgusted and I do not recommend  this  place at all. Go to Los Tacos on Charleston if you want good, fresh food."}
{"text":"I wish I would have came here sooner! Super clean, friendly staff . I ordered  the al pastor and carnitas tacos. Delicious! Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! Went today after hearing several co-workers talking about it and I am over the top impressed!!!  I got the Chicken Burrito and it was delicious.  The portion was a good lunch size burrito.  I got the combo that came with chips and a soda for $9.99.  The staff was friendly and fast in addition the restaurant was clean.

I will be going there again.  Soon!"}
{"text":"Ok.. so this is my new favorite Mexican food joint. The pork meat ( carnitas) they have is so Gooood YUM!!  Every time I have gone here the food is always fresh . I have yet to try the Frescas, its like a flavored fruit beverage .Its looks good. I love the nachos with the pork meat and the carne asada burrito. Rice and benas are great too. The restaraunt itself has nice dimmed lighting and is clean .The staff is always nice and attentive. I reccommend this place to anyone who like fast fresh mexican!"}
{"text":"The agua fresca's are to die for!!  Both times I went here I bought the spinach and was not disappointed. Tried a sip of the cactus and strawberry flavors and they are just as awesome.  My friends and I had the chance nay I say the privilege of meeting Greg and I dare say he is the most personable man in Las Vegas.    Needless to say the customer service at Frijoles is wonderful.  
If you are looking for a new Mexican food adventure then you and your friends definitely have to stop by Frijoles.  Whether you just came from going to the temple or playing a round of poker, it's time to make Frijoles Your new place to eat afterwards."}
{"text":"Food was good.  I ordered the 2 mini taco meal and street corn, but they brought my whole meal separately! Didnt even get my drink first. Customer service was so so but they were busy."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The staff are super friendly and welcoming. I love the food here and everything I have tried is wonderful."}
{"text":"The shrimp cocktail is amazing! 12.99 medium is huge. Big enough for 3! Tacos are great. Crunchy and soft corn tortilla with melted cheese between the two. The chips are very crispy and fresh. Not too greasy. Got full off the shrimp cocktail couldn't even bite into the shrimp burrito :/ reason for 4 stars is due to the lack of clean tables. I asked the worker to clean the table for me and it was still dirty and sticky. She was very sweet THO."}
{"text":"This place rocks! Food's great and consistent. The premises are clean and the staff stands out. Always a smile and great attitude. You would think that everyone who worked here was an owner because of the pride and work ethic. This is a great example of a well oiled machine from manager to staff."}
{"text":"The food is really great, order is always right, the place is clean as well, customer service is the only thing really lacking at this place! Just go there knowing your food will b so good and don't mind the less than enthusiastic employees : )"}
{"text":"We came to Frijoles hoping to have found a good Mexican place to have a meal, and we found dissapointment! I found Frijoles on yelp and don't believe the hype. This place is not good. My bf had a burrito meal and I had the mini tacos meal. The burrito was dry and so were my tacos. I could've made better tasting tacos at home, they were also bland...The meat had no flavor and it was dry as well. The only good things about our meal were my horchata drink, which wasn't too sweet, it was perfect! The chips were also good and crunchy. Other than that our experience was far from great. Last thing...overly expensive. We could've paid the $20 and would've had a better meal at Los Tacos."}
{"text":"I found this place while trying to find something to eat and boy am I glad I did.  This place is amazing from the customer service to the food. I have only been in Vegas for 4 days and I now have a favorite restaurant. Absolutely delicious I will be back l."}
{"text":"Place was welcoming and food n' drinks were spectacular! The service was decent and free samples are a plus if you've never had anything form them. 

The only thing i wish they'd change up is the quantity. The quality of the food is refreshing. Not really leaving you heavy, which is a plus for me. But i would definitely recommend anyone here for some fresh n easy Mexican food."}
{"text":"Got the burrito with Al pastor pork. Very flavorful. Reasonably priced. Very friendly. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"So this place is seriously rad. The chia limeade drink is amazing, that one blew me away. This is the first good Mexican place on the west side.  I keep trying different stuff and so far I love the quesadilla  with Al Pastor meat the most. So I brought the whole family  (6 of us)  and it totally worked. I felt comfortable and got the real deal food.
So I also  tried their Mexican street corn. That stuff was amazing. If you haven't tried it just do it- so good, blow your mind good. You have to try it, now!"}
{"text":"I had this restaurant cater for my husband's birthday party.  Everything was great from the service to the food to the price.  They delivered and set up, as well as provided all the essential serving items, and the price was fantastic for the amount of food we got.  They included everything in the food package, such as sour cream, two different sauces, chips and salsa, and an excellent guacamole.  I would highly recommend this restaurant for anyone that is looking to cater an event."}
{"text":"Great food, authentic and delicious! Service was great! Restaurant very clean. I will return time and again."}
{"text":"Yum!

This place seems to be Chipotle version 2.0. Everything is a little bit better :)
They have some different sides like mexican street corn and some nice different beverages you don't see everywhere. I can tell the workers really aimed to please. I had a pork burrito and they didn't cheapen out. 

If I had a craving for a Chipotle style burrito, I would go either here or Cafe Rio. They are way better!! :D"}
{"text":"i came here for my first time today.. i got the carne asada nachos, shrimp quesadilla, tostada shrimp ceviche, rice , beans and cheesecake chimichanga. The nachos were a bit soggy & they didn't mix any of it together. They also barely put any carne Assad which was disappointing cause it looked so good in the pictures on yelp. The ceviche was ok, just needed some salt & pepper..The rice was good but I think out of everything the shrimp quesadilla & cheesecake chimichanga were my favorite. I wanted to order a drink but I felt like the lady was rushing me for my order so I did it to go instead of a dine in."}
{"text":"Our family has been twice, once when they first opened and then again this past weekend. Great food and the Frescas are so fun and yummy!

My only reason for lower stars is the personality of the girl working the register. She has no personality. After finding out about the restaurant by being a subscriber of Arturo's YouTube account I was expecting someone fun and outgoing. 

During our first visit we loved the salsa and wanted to see if they sold a bigger side to go. She gave us small ones with no real dialogue of if larger ones were offered. On our second visit we saw a Fresca, but weren't sure what kind it was and it looked really good! When we asked her what it was she looked at us, looked at the drink as it went by to be delivered and didn't respond.  

We will definitely try again I would just love a bit more of a fun experience."}
{"text":"My first time at Frijoles, I ordered three mini tacos so that I could sample the carne asada, pollo and al pastor. Of the three, the al pastor was divine with onion, cilantro and a squeeze of fresh lime. I went back and ordered the al pastor burrito style and was a bit disappointed that the accoutrements kinda took away from the flavor of al pastor. Love the different types of fruit drinks. The staff is super friendly and will let you sample anything. The place seems to have a tremendous following."}
{"text":"For starters, the chia water was so refreshing.  Plus they had several other delicious waters as well.  I had the carnitas tostada, cheese quesidilla, mexican corn and chips and salsa.  Loved it all.  Authentic and full of flavor. I wish it was tomorrow already so I could go back..."}
{"text":"First time eating here.  Burrito is awesome and the drinks are amazing.  Try the spinach drink."}
{"text":"The lengua  burrito was good, though it wasn't big like robertos or taco y taco, it did taste good though. The fresca  wasn't bad either, the lady at the counter is the main reason this place gets a 4 instead of 5, she was rude and rolled her eyes when I changed my order. But the place was clean and had a nice layout. Oh the frozen ice cream was good too."}
{"text":"I've lived in Vegas for 30 years and this is the best Mexican food I have had!! The service is excellent, and I probably go 2-3 times per week for lunch. The carne asada tacos are frickin awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious Mexican street corn! I love this place. Great drinks too."}
{"text":"Dig the food here not fast food but really good food, everything I have tried is so amazing the carnitas burrito delicious the tacos are quality and the street corn reminds me of my trips to Mexico when I was younger."}
{"text":"The taco al pastor and the aguas frescas are off the chart! I am a true fan of this place. The food is great and service is excellent."}
{"text":"We are here eating our dinner the food was great so we decided to order more. Extra cheese and extra tortilla. I spent at $40.00 for our meal. Anyways I  Oder just the cheese quesadilla at 734pm.  30 minutes after at 805pm finally got it. Really it takes that long to make the cheese quesadilla but yet they have plenty of time to make the others while I  had to come up to the register to get my Oder but she only gave me the tortilla and waited for the cheese really... Wow I could just went ahead at home and make it myself."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic meal at Frijoles tonight! Had a carnitas taco and the pork was tender and full of flavor, the street corn was great, and the fruit blend Horchata was really good! Restaurant was clean and servers were efficient and friendly, no one rushed us out even though we came pretty close to closing time. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I got the taco de asada which comes with pico de gallo, sour cream, frijoles, and guacamole. It was really good I loved that it came with two tortillas and one of them was crispy!!! I also got the strawberry horchata which was amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"Not bad. Juices/drinks are great (no alcohol )  selection is decent with items you won't find too many other places. Street corn on the comb,"}
{"text":"Just came here for the first time for dinner. I am very picky about carne asada. I dont like fatty pieces of meat etc. I am happy to report that the carne asada here is delish! Not fatty at all :) I got the carne asada taco and tostado. Both were very good! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Simple menu with amazing food. Saw someone with the corn and regret not trying that, definitely coming back for it. I had grilled chicken fries and carnitas nachos. Generous portions and more than reasonable prices."}
{"text":"This place is horrible the food is dry and expensive. ..When compared to taco bell taco bell seems like  real Mexican cuisine. I'm not an expert but I would avoid this place and take my chances with a hungry man Mexican dinner."}
{"text":"I was there yesterday, i love it. Usually the first ting i do is going to the bathroom it was impeccable . The floor in the kitchen was very clean. 
Something that is extremely important the food temperature, all my food was really hot !!!!!!! Excellent.
This is a very good place!!!!!! Keep on!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Was leaving the parking lot after visiting another business there and as I rode my motorcycle by this place the delicious smell drew me in. The food was very fresh, and very good quality. I got the taco platter with beans and rices, and ordered a side of chips and guacamole.

I like it, fresh tasting as I said, but I found it a little on the bland side. I like zesty tasting Mexican food and this was a little more neutral for the average person. But the quality shined through and I'll be back. 

Staff was very friendly and helpful. I felt welcome in their establishment."}
{"text":"This place  is ok.. Only been here a few times.. The chicken burrito tasted  burn.. Tasted mainly the beans.. Always busy.. I guess that's good for the business.. Last time I was here my order took 20 min before  it was delivered  to me.. And there wasn't many people  at that time.. Will see next time if I come back again"}
{"text":"On my way right now!!!! Best fresh Mexican food in town. I love how everything is cooked fresh and made fresh. I love clean and welcoming environment and the staff here is really nice. It is in an unlikely little shopping plaza a little hidden but I swear it is a hidden GEM. This is gonna be my second time back and I am picky cuz I'm pregnant but this definitely hits the spot. Last visit I had the Asada nachos probably gonna have the same it was so bomb. Must try... now really go now. No need to read anymore reviews I wouldn't lie to ya!"}
{"text":"Great food, great prices, friendly service, and cozy atmosphere. We are regulars and are never disappointed. We will be going back often."}
{"text":"I eat hear 3 times a week food is awesome and service is great price a littel high but worth the price front counter people are great,thanks again I will return for future business"}
{"text":"We love Frijoles. I usually get the shrimp ceviche tostada. The shrimp is always fresh. The employees have always been very helpful and I haven't had anything bad from here. I recommend it highly over the competitors due to it cleanliness and taste. Give it a shot."}
{"text":"My husband and I are always on the hunt for a place to eat some street tacos, burritos, or even nachos.  I've been here 4 times now and each time they are consistently friendly and delicious.  We typically go to Taco y Taco as it is on our side of town, but we recently drove up to Frijoles because we know that the product is just as good, we like the small/low-key atmosphere here, and the pricing is a bit lower.  We give it two thumbs up and will be recommending this place to all of our friends and visitors!  Go and get their mini tacos (we prefer al pastor), nachos, and fries!!!"}
{"text":"The best Mexican place we ate in Vegas. My wife and I love to find little taco shops!"}
{"text":"Wow. Great tasting food. I had the carna asada plate and my girl had the burrito. Real delicious. Good quality in all aspects.  From the rice to beans to steak. It's a Lil pricey but shitpoodles it's worth it!!!!"}
{"text":"I just love the carnitas tacos the big ones with salsa guacamole and beans they are bomb...  good service and quality food"}
{"text":"this place if awesome.. i was just tryin to find out a quick bite to eat place and i've searched.. yelp landed me on this place.. i thought its just a regular place for tacos and burritos but i kid you not this place is something different.. one of the best al pastor tacos i've eaten by far the cucumber, pineapple and spinach agua fresca combo is now my go to drink 

the girl Norma had me try it first and damn its freaking good.. she even handed me some coupons for my next visit.. and i will definitely come back and dine with my wife and kids.."}
{"text":"It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either. I really wanted to love it, but there are just too many better options on this side of town. 

I didn't try the corn. I'll have to go back for that. Chicken quesadilla, carne asada nachos, carne asada burritos that we all exchanged and tried weren't worth another trip."}
{"text":"I am updating my review a little to make notes of a few improvements, my original review remains below.

I already loved this place, and it remains a new family favorite, and it seems to be spreading around my extended family like a virus, as we bring more family back each time.

First, this place is worth the trip just for the delicious drinks that they serve. My wife loves the \"Chia water\" and I can't get enough of the pineapple drink. We find ourselves wanting to go back frequently just for the drinks.

Second, here are the improvements they have made since the last time we ate there: the food now comes out much more quickly, and you no longer need to get up multiple times to get food for your table, because they now give you numbers to place on your table, and then bring the food out to the table. this is a small thing, but really made the visit this time so much better. Thanks to the management for implementing the small changes suggested by the Yelp community. Other than that, our food was again, delicious. My original full review is below.

Lately I have been trying hard to get my kids out and try new places, sometimes that goes over well, other times it doesn't. Tonight, it went over very well.

Don't get me wrong, there is much that others might criticize about the place, but I think that most of that could actually be some of the place's unique strengths. I found Frijoles to be refreshingly unappologetic.

1. The location: Opening a new place in Vegas can be a gamble, especially a place away from the strip and tourism. In this case, that is a good thing. This place isn't for the tourists (although they are missing out if they don't seek out the unique in Vegas), it is for the natives.

2. The menu: There are some unique options on the menu, such as tongue and \"cabeza.\" The meat options on the menu also are in Spanish only, and the cashier had to translate them for my kids. Again, this did not bother me at all, because for us it added to the experience. Tongue is not something that my kids are used to seeing on menus and their disgusted reaction was exactly as I expected it to be, but I like that the place caters to a specific crowd and isn't out to please everyone.

3. The setup: This is an easy one to pick apart, as the line and ordering are different than most are used to (and by most, I mean the Qdoba/Chipotle/Cafe Rio lovers). This is one thing that I would not say is a strength, but it is not necessarily a hindrance either. It is a bit awkward to walk in past the food and not really be able to see the menu until you are up to order, but that is only an issue the first time, after that, you pretty much know the menu for any repeat visits.

4. Fast food?: This is the one critique that I will make on which I would like to see some improvement. The food did come out to us piecemeal and it did take some time. One child's nachos came first, followed by another's fries, then the last three dishes came out all at once. for the first 2 dishes, my number was called and I had to get up to get them, the last 3 were brought out to us. I am totally fine with the food coming out at different times, or getting up to get my food, but not both at the same time. If the food is going to be ready seperately, then it should be brought out to the table. During a busier time having to get up to get out food would have meant having to break through the ordering line due to the setup, so my one big suggestion to the management would be to have the food brought out to the guests.

5. Finally, the food: My whole family thought that the food tasted really good. Between the 5 of us, we had a good variety of the items on the menu, and everyone sampled each dish. I had the carnitas burrito which was good, but after sampling the kids chicken dishes, I wished that I would have gone the chicken route instead. They also have an awesome variety of drinks in addition to the usual fountain drinks. Unfortunately they did not have the pineapple drink tonight, but my wife got the chia seed water, which was really good.

overall, probably not perfect by many standards, but we really enjoyed the food and my kids have a new favorite place for nachos. It is locally owned and offers an authentic taco shop experience."}
{"text":"This our new favorite eatery for fast fare Mexican food in Las Vegas. Food is delicious and service is quick and friendly. Carne asada tacos, carnitas taco are outstanding. Highly recommend the shrimp cocktail and the ceviche tostadas."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this restaurant and since the reviews looked pretty good we decided to give it a try. Which makes us the winners because this place rocks!!! Friendly service, clean restaurant and delicious, amazing food! Plus, their fresh fruit juices are tasty! We will be back"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant about 6 times and the new restaurant on Rainbow. Love them both! I don't experiment a lot with with different orders, heck it is Mexican food; all the same ingredients; meats, beans, cheeses and tortillas, it just a matter of how you like it presented and in what proportions (although they do have the best corn on the cob if you don't mind gaining a pound after one meal). I know what I like and it has always been hot, juicy and great quality. One thing I do customize is the fresca; 90% Horchata, 10% Strawberry Juice. Sometimes they mess up on the percentages but that allows me to explore a new blend...but they always get it right on the refill :). Definitely worth a visit!!!"}
{"text":"First time eating here tonight! It was excellent! I had the chicken tacos, my husband the shrimp burrito. We both think it is the best Mexican food in Vegas!! Awesome!!"}
{"text":"Amazing customer service and great food! The first time I went here the guy taking orders made recommendations and walked me through the items. All the employees are courteous and friendly. And the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"Excellent!!!   We stopped on a whim and it was delicious.  I had the chicken quesadilla...fresh ingredients and very tasty.  My husband loved the tostado and mini tacos...he went back for thirds!  Highly reccomend."}
{"text":"Yes and yes. Carne asada burrito, fresh chips and pico. Agua frescas with a lot of variety and the abilty to combine them. Clean place and very nice service."}
{"text":"The tacos are to expensive $4.45 ... they used the worst corn tortilla .. u can find in any store .. Guerrero .a process .. horrible smell. 
I was hopping to find a better and authentic mexican street taco .. with a homemade tortilla .. for the price ..
Don't used sour cream to taco .. that's Taco bell...
The asada beef has a good flavor and very tender.. they have a good customer service ... employees very nice..and helpful. 

I hope u guys can improve your tacos.."}
{"text":"I'm am so glad I found this place thanks to yelp! The food was amazing, the staff was very friendly, and the Aguas frescas are delicious! I found my new favorite Mexican food spot!"}
{"text":"Usually a great place to eat.  However, today was an off day.  Received the wrong order the first time.  Finally got our tacos.  But waited forever on our corn and drinks.   Finally received our last item the quesadilla after about 20 minutes. I had to walk up repeatedly to ask for it."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food!! I had the pork tacos and steak nachos, all I can say is wow! Everything is super fresh, great flavors. I highly also recommend the mexican street corn, they make it fresh right there on the spot."}
{"text":"I had a large taco and two mini tacos. They were very good and surprisingly better then most Southern California taco stands.  Highly recommend for a quick taco fix, even though it's a little bit out of the way."}
{"text":"Went in a couple of weeks ago had there salad overly priced chicken was cold it had more lettuce than anything. Honestly I don't know what the big deal is about this place I surely won't be back after I eat there I got very sick to my stomach save yourself  some money and go to cafe Rio a least the meat is hot went it gets served"}
{"text":"Never disappoints. One of my favorite Mexican joints. Friendly staff, authentic cooking, and clean environment."}
{"text":"This place is the best place to get mexican food in las vegas. I even compare this to ones in san diego. Love the staff, love the agua frescas, always fresh tasting food, and obviously their pinto beans is as authentic as it gets. Only thing I will miss from Las Vegas...I will miss you!"}
{"text":"Great food, reasonably priced and decent portions. So why only three starts?

Simple. The service is ca-ca. 

Way too slow and you are completely ignored. Slow service doesn't necessarily bother me, but being ignored does. If a customers is going to sit and wait forever (25 minutes for a to go order), you need to address it. Recognize and apologize for the delay. Show a little empathy. Do something. Anything! 

However, the lack of attention and long wait is somewhat offset by the Keystone Cop like performance that the staff puts on. They've got a ton of people behind the counter yelling, grabbing tickets, banging into each other, etc. It's a hoot! The entertainment, though unintentional I'm sure, does help."}
{"text":"I love how fresh the shrimp taste in their shrimp burrito! Most times, I can only eat half of the burrito but if you're hungry, the big serving can definitely satisfy your growling stomach! 

And oh! This is the spot where I fell in love with agua fresca. My favorite is the spinach and pineapple mixed up together...delish!"}
{"text":"Excellent.  From the moment you walk in staff greet you with a friendly hello.  You have your choice between a \"mini\" taco with choice of meat, onions, and cilantro or a \"regular\" taco with more toppings.  I had the Pork Carnitas and it was fantastic.  Hubby had the carne asada and it was ok, but not as good as the Pork.  Overall good food, good price, and friendly service."}
{"text":"1st time here and the food is absolutely delicious!! the staff is so friendly! the place is clean and organized.
Street corn is bomb!"}

{"text":"My experience at Frijoles was welcoming and enjoyable.  I order the Nachos de Carne Asada con todo, with everything. They are very tasty but are missing some more nacho cheese... Anyways, this is my second time coming to Frijoles Restaurant and I will keep coming back to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Always love coming here for their tacos and fruit drink.   But I love that they had a sign out the door to welcome anyone whose waiting in-line to give blood to use their restroom."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing!!! I will be visiting  very often,the location is good staff is friendly and helpful!!! I will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"My favorite place for street tacos! The frescas are also yummy! The staff is nice and everything always tastes fresh! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is my go to. Mini tacos are very good. They have a friendly fast service and reasonable prices. The fruit drinks are not too sweet."}
{"text":"Al pastor tacos, carné asada and cabeza tacos were really good.   All lean meat no fat at all or chewy  
My only problem is that my order to go didn't have red salsa only green , no limones . 

The street corn  needs to come with more mayonnaise and cheese and extra stuff .

The bean burrito with cheese needs to have more cheese . 

Over all the place is clean 
I will only come here for tacos"}
{"text":"I was thinking about to eat over there long time ago, I gave a chance to the tongue taco and...the best taco de lengua in town!!!! and really good aguas frescas. They have a little fridge with ice creams. Today they won a costumer!!!!"}
{"text":"I like this place a lot!

I came last Saturday for the third time. I always enjoy the food and I think that the service is friendly and fast. The prices are a little bit expensive, but it's a great treat.

I LOVE the corn and the tacos. Everything tastes fresh. The agua fresca is delicious - try the pineapple!

I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place makes great food, however the wait time to actually get your food after ordering is extremely long. I had to wait 30 minutes for al pastor nachos which is ridiculous (and they came cold). The servers routinely forget to bring items that I order such as sides of fried onions/peppers as well as drinks."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! aguas frescas are to die for.... so many flavors and so delicious."}
{"text":"So good!!! This place is delicious! You need to try the chicken tacos and the chips and salsa. Their salsa is amazing- chunky tomatoes, cilantro, onion...all the good stuff but no ingredient over-powers the other; it's just the perfect balance. Beware, this food is addictive. It's quite the drive from my house, but it is well worth it. The Frescas are amazing!! I will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Everything is delicious here. Street corn, tacos, burritos and drinks are all amazing, consistently. The service is always friendly and speedy. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I ended up here based on Yelp reviews and the 4.5 stars this place was given. We got the carne asada burrito combo that comes with chips, salsa, and a fountain drink for $9.99 The chips and salsa (pico de gallo) were bland but at least the chips were freshly made. The burrito was missing flavor and the salsas were mediocre. The 2 stars I'm giving them is for being pet friendly!"}
{"text":"I couldn't recommend Frijoles enough!! We LOVED it!! The food is fresh and sooo flavorful. The juices are yummy. Not sure which one to pick? They will let you sample them first. We had the chicken tacos which were stuffed to the brim, chicken salad, fresh guacamole and mexican corn. Everything was wonderful! The employees are all so hard working, providing great service and their attention to cleanliness was nice to see. They wear gloves when handling food and I observed them always cleaning, cleaning, cleaning.  I was sorry to leave my vacation in Las Vegas, mainly because I will miss this place. This kind of food is hard to find."}
{"text":"It's Cinco de Mayo and to float your Cadillac margie' ---- IT'S FRIDAYYYYYYY!!!

Whoooo hooo! 

I'm calling it .........\"Cinco de Friday\"!

While toting a flask of Don Julio in one hand, I've got a chimichanga within my front pocket.

(Heh Heh Heh...)

Then again.... Whose to say that it's REALLY a chimichanga?

#POW!!!

If anything, my pocket fiesta just further solidifies that I'll be reviewing this Las Vegas Mex' fix in Haiku to better convene my booze binge.

{"text":"MUY DELICIOSO! My coworkers are big fans of this place & I eventually caved in to partake, especially since it was cinco de mayo! I'm always on the fence when it comes to Mexican food (due to a food poisoning event I had in the past & the fact it just always seems so oily in general) -- but to my surprise, this place's food is very fresh & not at all heavy like I expected it to be! Nothing was greasy and had amazing flavor without being overly salty.  

I ordered: 
- CHICKEN SALAD 
- CHICKEN TOSTADA

Not a fan of beans so I requested none on both. They use traditional dark meat, not white chicken breast -- which is more fatty but definitely gives it so much flavor! My coworker's also swear by their steak quesadillas and carnitas burritos, but I'm already in love with their chicken. Will definitely be frequenting this place more since it's just down the street from work! ;)

NOTE: Closed on Sundays."}
{"text":"A little pricy but delicious. I had the carne asada burrito  with chips and salsa. The pico de gallo was really fresh and delicious  also had a fresa agua fresca and it was truly refreshing. I'll be back for the street corn"}
{"text":"Amazing service amazing food and its very cheap which is a plus. The tacos are big and the mini tacos taste just like street tacos.its not greasy like other restaurants make them. And the Aguas Frescas are soo good and 100% made with real fruits and veggies."}
{"text":"Love their tacos and everything else. The only reason why I dont give them 5 stars is because its over prized for a taco shop."}
{"text":"A little pricey, but I love the overstuffed tacos, the elote (street corn), and the aguas frescas, plus they're always fast and friendly."}
{"text":"This was a great experience.   The food was delicious and it came out quickly.   It's impressive that you a place like this receive 4.5 stars and it actually is just that.   

Bringing my family next time."}
{"text":"I'm editing my review due to paying for \"extra cheese\" but never getting it. So I did an experiment and bought a few burritos at different times and order extra cheese and those burritos had the same amount of cheese as if I ordered it regular. So I'm getting charged for nothing. I don't complain and bring it back because you know what they say about sending food back. So I just kept it and left it alone. Basically the moral of the story is, don't pay for anything extra because you will not get it anyway"}
{"text":"Went to Frijoles and it was 11:06 am.  Could see three employees inside working and they could see my guest and I.  They waited another three or four minutes before coming to open the front doors.  Then after ordering and sitting at a table a loud explosion went off behind the counter.  But the food is great.  Hope someone learns how to tell time and control the loud noises in the future.

{"text":"Frijoles is one of my favorite places to eat.  Service is great and friendly, the facility is clean and in order, and the food is MAGNIFICIENT.

We have bee going since they opened and try to go at least once a week.  Love the Carne Asada and the Shrimp Tostada.  The Cactus salad and guacamole are great.  Love Love Love this place.....you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food? Sort of. This is a half service restaurant and looks and feels like its halfway between Cafe Rio and El Torito. The food tastes like their food too. Fresh and slightly bland for the American palate.

I got a lengua burrito. Its came out hot and slightly crisp. Inside was guac, pico de gillo, lengua, sour cream, cheese, and white/pinto bean. Overall, I liked the lengua, tortilla, and pico; those components were great. The burrito just didn't come together for me. Too much sour cream/cheese in some bites. I'm not s fan of pinto beans either. 

Service is nonchalant and apathetic. I'm not sure if a just family left because the register was empty; they didnt look happy. 

This a decent lunch spot if you happen to be nearby."}
{"text":"Excellent carne Asada tacos and delicious fresh fruit juice. I'll be dreaming about the spinach lime juice! My husband had a burrito and the watermelon juice with chia lemonade and enjoyed it very much.   Also, super friendly staff and very clean restaurant. We will be returning very soon!"}
{"text":"Great little Mexican food place! You have to try the shrimp cocktail, filed with shrimp and avocados! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The watermelon frecsa is AMAZING and that's from a watermelon snob (if there is such a thing). Will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"It's a great local spot! Love their food and drinks...  and the customer service, awesome!

I love a decent taco spot. This is my local taco spot in Vegas so far.

Originally, I came for the tacos. The tacos got my mouth watering every time. It tastes fresh and it's not too greasy.  I gorge on their burritos. Extra wet please! yum!!. I think I've tried almost everything the menu.

The cucumber, pineapple, spinach drink the lady made for me reminded me of my mornings in Cancun. I don't know what it is about that drink but I feel refreshed every time.

For a fast food local spot, it's top notch on my book."}
{"text":"Seriously worst chain Mexican food I've ever eaten. When i say No seasoning i mean NONE.. this is Caucasian and over 80 Mexican food. 

Service was slow there was 4 people in there with us and it took them 15 min to give me a thing of
Chips with rice and beans ( which i had to then ask for ) the street corn was soggy. 

However the pinã pineapple drink was"}
{"text":"reasonable price and delicious nachos! Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"I had the chicken quesadilla with a side of rice & frijoles & the hubby had the chicken taco meal. I was very happy with the quality of the food and the service was great. The staff were very patient with ordering. The food also came really fast. I took off one star for the flavor. It just didn't knock my socks off with flavor. I would come back, though."}
{"text":"Love this place! Everything on the menu is so fresh. No matter what you get, you'll be pleased. The shrimp tacos are my favorite along with an elote & a horchata-pineapple agua fresca. Makes the PERFECT meal. Definitely worth trying, so good I drive all the way from Henderson to get Frijoles' tacos (:"}
{"text":"When I ordered the elote, I thought I was going to get it in a cup.. Nope! You get it just like you would in the neighborhood, super authentic! The tacos were bomb too and didn't disappoint."}
{"text":"By far the best Tacos Ive had outside of Mexico. We made the mistake of getting a pizza next door. While they made our pizza we walked to Frijoles Fresca. And we decided to order there too... What a great choice. Food was awesome. Customer service was great. Outstanding. My family loved it, and its now our new go to for good Mexican food."}
{"text":"Very nice street-style tacos they have a nice selection of fresh juices for example horchatas lime with Chia seeds pineapple strawberry cantaloupe too many to list I've had a couple of them they were all delicious"}
{"text":"The positive is the taco I had was good, beyond that the size is small for a $5 taco. This place is priced out of their league, for a McDonald's style eatery it is easily $25 a person to leave here full. Vegas is filled with Mexican restaurants that have good food, reasonable prices and waiters that actually wait on you, opposed to seat yourself and clean your own table mentality. Not sure what so many others see in this place, maybe I just went on half size taco day, a bit of a disappointment."}
{"text":"When you bite into a burrito from Frijoles & Frescas, it's exactly what you'd hope a Baja Fresh burrito would taste like...but Baja always sucked!  Frijoles & Frescas nailed it!  You can really taste the freshness of the ingredients.  I don't think their tacos are anything to write home about, but they're simple, fresh and hit the spot. Try the Aquas Frescas...it'll change your life!  The house salsa provided on the tables is soooooo good, I wish they bottled it for sale!  

Even though there's usually a little bit of a language barrier with the cashiers, their service is always super smiley, and to me that's the cherry on top!  

This location is usually pretty slow, but I really hope they do well as more and more people discover the deliciousness that Frijoles & Frescas has to offer.  Yum yum!"}
{"text":"JUST PLAIN AMAZING!!!!  Food is the best in town and the employees are exceptionally friendly.  I love eating here!!"}
{"text":"FRIJOLES!! Let me start out by saying the second I took a bite of the food I texted several friends how great it was (with pictures included) 

I had to try three different mini tacos to see which I would like most, Al Pastor, Lengua, and Carnitas, each one was equally delicious. The freshness of the onions, cilantro, and salsa just added to the greatness of each meat. 

As a huge fan of burritos, I got the Carne Asada burrito with avocado, sour cream, pinto beans, pico, and cheese. It was packed with flavor and freshness. All the meat is grilled do don't expect the greasy norm!


The staff was impeccable. The lack of a self serve salsa bar won't stop you from getting what you want from any of helpful crew here.

 I will be back to enjoy more from Frijoles."}
{"text":"Today the women taken our order was so friendly and explained everything perfect. Fresh squeezed juice . Delicious shrimp and steak taco blasting with flavor. Food quality a+. Clean a+ go now for delicious food and fresh fruit drinks !!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went here during our trip to Vegas to meet \"@Mr.ArturoTrejo\" and he was there serving, making drinks, and taking orders! It was our first time and we were pleasantly surprised. Food was nice and hot, tasty, and filling. We got a little of everything and we all enjoyed it. The drinks were delicious too, even the spinach drink. Arturo brought us our drinks and gladly chatted with us when we mentioned we watched his youtube videos. He was super nice! Glad we came!"}
{"text":"I love the fresh juices! Try watermelon. 

The nachos are very good. The restaurant was clean and the staff was super pleasant. This restaurant might be conducive to those that have quick lunch breaks. It is conveniently located in close proximity to Spring Valley Hospital. I was on a quick lunch break today.

At Frijoles & Frescas you place your order and pay at the counter, the food is made then delivered to your table. You get your own fountain drink and utensils. 

The nachos have steak strips, tomatoes, beans, guacamole, sour cream, and jalapeños. This is well worth the money. I followed this with a taco, which had a double soft shell. The taco was priced at $4.50 for just the one taco. I had been informed it was a super large taco for that price - but, it wasn't.  I am not sure I will spend that much for one taco again, but I will definitely try some other things next time I am in the area on a lunch break.

The burrito's are great! I had the chicken burrito on a subsequent visit."}
{"text":"The first time I ate here was wonderful I ordered the Carne Asada salad it was really good, today when I ate here I was let down by the Carne Asada Quesadilla, I was on the skimpy side for meat and I took it back up to the counter because I thought they forgot the cheese that's how much cheese was on it. My husband ordered the shrimp Quesadilla and his had too much cheese go figure...lol. I think the thing that got me the most is if i am thinking there is no cheese on it most would of asked if i would like more added right? He just said yep it's in there it all the meat hiding it(which was not the case) and handed it back.The taste was good but I think it should of been toasted longer when I ate it it did not make me feel like i was eating a Quesadilla. I gave this 3 stars because the food was tasty and fresh but not satisfying my Quesadilla craving."}
{"text":"I was VERY disappointed at this place. I was super hungry after a workout and on a low carb meal plan. It was rated at 4.5 stars and had decent reviews on Yelp.

Unfortunately, my experience tonight was disheartening. I ordered a carne asada salad without the beans and rice, requesting additional lettuce as a replacement.

When I got my order, it looked yummy! Then I go straight for the meat and the carne asada was bland, cold, and chewy. I realize that maybe serving the meat cold is a default here. I prefer my meat warm with my salad as I am accustomed to other Mexican places I frequent. I can be confident in saying I had better tasting carne asada around town.

Another point is that there was hardly any cheese at all. Most Mexican restaurants do not hold back on their cheese. I guess on the salad, cheese is used as a small amount of garnish instead of being part of the meal?

Overall, the staff and service were great. The restaurant was nice and clean. There is plenty of seating available when it gets busy. I may come around for a second visit and try their tacos for comparison to other Mexican eateries around town."}
{"text":"at these prices for fantastic food, this place makes me feel like a rich Spaniard instead of a poor Mexican, like most of the real good Mexican places do. Carne Asada of quality and al pastor tacos which do the job, when most cheapy kinda places cannot compete with these. Those are more dog foodie tacos. Good quesadillas but those are hard to screw up."}
{"text":"I just tried the shrimp cocktails which are one of the biggest I have ever seen. It cost 15$ it tasted pretty good. The cocktail comes with chips and saltines. You get a free drink when you check in on yelp so thats great. Only thing was that the restroom was really dirty so I left without using it."}
{"text":"Four tacos is too many! Nice avocado on each taco. I prefer the shrimp taco to the taco al pastor but both are good. For a fast food outlet the atmosphere is pleasant. Agua fresca drinks are refreshing - try the mango and cucumber flavors."}
{"text":"LOVVVVVEEEEEE this place. I mean love. Like Romeo & Juliet. Where our love is forbidden but I don't care. I've had the nachos, burritos, tacos, and tostadas (all carne asada of course). EVERYTHING is legit, delicious, and legitimately delicious. I don't understand how people can go to Robertos when Frijoles is in Vegas! ARE YOU LOCO EN LA CABEZA?! Although I do love everything I've tried so dearly, the only reason why I can only give them 4 stars is because I'm from LA and King Taco and El Taurino is #1 in my heart forever. 

Now, if Frijoles could figure out a way to get King Taco's carne asada and tortilla recipe and their red and green sauce then we would be in biiiiizzzzzzznessssss!"}
{"text":"Street style tacos, pastor, lengua... What? No ground beef? Fine by me. Get me the carne! Looking for some good tacos or burritos at reasonable prices, I stumbled upon lots of good Yelp reviews for this little stripmall gem. 

Service was helpful and patient, since we took a few minutes to decide. I also like the open kitchen."}
{"text":"Got the Carne Asada Burrito with chips was huge--not spicy just they way I like it. Husband used the sauces on the table for more spice and said the green one was great. There is a huge variety of flavors of aquas Frescas.i choose strawberry and it was delicious. I can't wait to come back and try every flavor! I really want to try the shrimp cocktail next time I'm here - some one next to us got it and it looked awesome."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place since my hubby has a very special diet and this place seemed like the only place we can get a yummy meal. 

I would like to start off by saying this place is super clean! There is enough room for large or small groups. Customer service is great and there are so many delicious options. 

We decided to try their chicken quesadilla and chicken platter. Couldnt believe how fast we got our order. 
Chicken was juicy and flavorful. The quesadilla was delicious!!"}
{"text":"We tried this spot for the first time last night.

I have to say, the food quality was pretty impressive. We ordered beef burritos, chips w/ cheese, and a cheese quesadilla.

We also ordered a chicken burrito. However, the cashier did not hear my wife order it. No charge and no chicken burrito. She decided to forego it & eat what we already ordered. 

I had a coupon for a free agua fresa, so I ordered the pineapple. If you want a refill, there is a dollar charge. So I received a spinach one the 2nd time. The Spinach drink is mixed with orange juice & lime. HIGHLY recommended. I also tried the chia lemonade, which was also amazing. If they ever had passion fruit agua fresa, I would stop there at least 2 or 3 times a week just for that!

The nachos w/ cheese - was just that. Chips with real cheese on top. I was hoping for someone a tad more elaborate, but I didn't argue about it. Maybe some pico de gallo on the side would have made it work?

The cheese quesdadilla was spot on. One of the best I had in Vegas.

The beef burrito was pretty tasty. Once again, I would hope for pico de gallo on the side, or a better choice of sauces. But, it was tasty in its own right.

The prices are not Del taco cheap, but it is comparable to Chipotle.

I will say, for a start up restaurant, I am impressed they have a good following already. I think Frijole's will be alright. We will go at least once a month - and maybe more if a few minor things are ironed out."}
{"text":"Everything I have had was delicious. Their juices are wonderful. The Carne AL Pastor was definitely my favorite meat."}
{"text":"Been driving by here so many times and finally stopped to give it a try. And was very happy we did. Got tacos, beef. And my girlfriend got a shrimp burrito. The salsa was really tasty and fresh. Real avocado served. It was a little busy but the service was fast and friendly. For sure coming back."}
{"text":"Nice open dinning room. Clean bathrooms. The nachos are absolutely delicious. My only complaint is it says it has jalapenos in them on the menu which is what I am currently craving. Theres none on them or even diced up in it. 0 spice to them. Not going to dock them a star for that though since they are still awesome. No chip was left uncovered with toppings."}
{"text":"Good food for the most part not a huge menu portions are a little small is all I can really say but flavor is acceptable nothing outstanding really I'll be back I'm sure if there no other place around that looks tempting I'm literally thinking about what to eat after this that would fill me up"}
{"text":"I ordered a burrito... Let me start by saying it was amazing. The melted cheese and the flavorful meat was delicious. From outside it doesn't look like much but this place really impressed me. As a Mexican I am always extremely critical to Mexican establishments (can't ever compete with Mom's food) but I can say those beans and that melted cheese in the burrito really brought me home! I highly recommend this establishments. And their mango drink.... That's another yelp review by itself."}
{"text":"Came here right when they opened. The young lady working the cashier was very friendly. I got some carne Asada tacos and a carne Asada burrito with guacamole and sour cream. Was very good. Tried the meat separately out of the taco, was very flavorful. I also got a aguas Frescas, half pepino and half strawberry, was delicious! Will visit next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time the other day. Staff was friendly and very clean environment. I ordered a chicken quesadilla and tacos, which was alright. Overall food is ok, but nothing special."}
{"text":"Order a shrimp taco! Freshly cooked and loaded with fajita veggies and guac, it was one of the best shrimp taco I've eaten.

Spinach orange juice, chips and guacamole were all great, too. Fresh and tasty.

Frijoles is a hidden gem in this area... I'll come back!"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good. What used to be a Pizza Hut is now a tasty taco joint. I had the cheese quesadilla and it was good. The tortilla had nice flavor. The watermelon drink here is the bomb. I liked the size of the carne asada burrito and the meat had good flavor but the meat was tough at times. The staff were friendly and inside was clean. It took some time to get the food once the order was placed however they are making it fresh so that's cool. you can call your order in for pick up too."}
{"text":"An average looking restaurant with amazing food! This is a hidden treasure that everyone should find. Affordable prices and delicious meals. You can't ask for more!!!"}
{"text":"The portions are very small, the steak was fatty and salty.  The tables were dirty and when i asked them to clean the table the girl who was preparing food used the same gloves to clean the table and went back to preparing food without changing her gloves YUCK!  as if that wasnt bad enough there was flies buzzing around our food... I DO NOT RECOMMEND"}
{"text":"My first experience here wasn't that great, the food was ok but my friends and I didn't feel great afterwards. I decided to come back and try it again, because being from San Diego I need my mexican food fix. This time I ordered a burrito and it is just ok once again. There isn't a lot of meat in the burrito and its a little plain. On the plus side both times I've been here the place is very clean and they also bring you the food. All and all its just ok, kind of reminds me of Chipotle."}
{"text":"Me and my sister-in-law came here for lunch our first time. By looking at their reviews and pictures on Yelp we were convinced to go. The line for lunch was long, we thought this place muuust be good. 

However, we weren't too pleased with it..nothing really stood out to us except their Agua Frescas. mix a flavor with horchata, i got strawberry horchata and i enjoyed it! 

The menu is fairly simple. We both got a burrito, my sister shrimp & i got carne asada.. don't be fooled by the menu though, be sure to ask what each meat burrito comes with! Because on the menu it says what is in a burrito .. but a shrimp burrito comes with fajitas (waaay too much fajitas) & rice ..when my carne asada burrito came with beans, very wet. Which i didn't know it would make my burrito soggy, the carne asada was also very salty! 

We also ordered the chips and guacamole. The guacamole was very spicy.. chips had waaay too much salt! (SEE PHOTO) Along with Mexican Street Corn, too much chili powder when we asked for it on the side because my sister doesn't do spicy. It was really spicy!

It is safe to say I only really enjoyed the Strawberry Agua Fresca and horchata. Hopefully my next experience here will be better than this."}
{"text":"The food has an authentic flavor but might make you feel like you drank the water in Mexico! I've been here 3 times and left each time feeling like Montezuma had my number."}
{"text":"I had very high expectations for Frijoles, and I think with a few changes they could turn things around.

The positives first.
Very clean and well decorated
Tacos had a layer of cheese that was a nice idea and tasted delicious
Great Guacamole
Good salsa
For some reason the fountain coke was really good
Very friendly staff

Down sides
Hard to figure out how to order, looks like a Chipolte when you walk in but you order at the opposite side where the register is.
No pictures to see what the food will look like.
Sneeze guard at head level makes it hard to communicate to staff.  (health dept thing not the restaurants' choice I'm sure.)
Very loud in dining room
Chips were passable but way too salty.  Possibly try less salt and a finer grain like popcorn salt since a little goes a long way.
Expensive for the portion size.
Carne tasted washed out like it was sitting in a pan and lost its caramelization.  Maybe I should order fresh off the grill next time?
Over all I have high hopes for Frijoles and think they could do very well with a few changes.  Good luck guys!"}
{"text":"Went here based on the 4.5 stars on yelp. Was craving a mexican shrimp cocktail. It was bomb! Loaded with shrimp,  avocados, tomatoes, cucumbers, onions and the sauce was perfect!  Didn't need to add a thing to it. Did I mention it is huge? My husband ordered the El pastor plate it was a little different then traditional El pastor but still yummy. The beans were amazing not the traditional pinto beans that you find every where they use Peruvian beans. We also got elote.  Super sweet and seasoned perfectly.  Very impressed, we will definitely be back. Keep in mind that they are closed on Sundays."}
{"text":"First time,food was pretty good but kind of expensive...4 bucks 4 a taco!!!
No bueno :/"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great tacos that are fresh, good price, and great vibes. Will definitely be back with be back with some clients after house hunting."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in town. Great Mexican food. I particularly like the marinated pork with my burrito. Mmm mm good."}
{"text":"My friends and I from Utah never leave Nevada without stoping at this place to eat the food is cheap, yet the quality and service is great! Yes maybe not very authentic, but it's close and very delicious and to me that's what counts! Love this place!"}
{"text":"It wasn't great, it wasn't terrible. It was entirely forgettable. I'd rather drive the extra 2 minutes around the corner to get to Serrano's."}
{"text":"Food came out cold. It took almost 30 minutes, which seemed unusual for a fast food place. The lady at the register was curt, to the point of rudeness. That didn't phase us at first since me and my husband are pretty easygoing when we go out to eat. Maybe the lady had a bad shift, we surmised. Given our first visit here was good, we loomed forward to tasty food. Biting into cold nachis was an unpleasant surprise and tipped the scales. It was two orders of nachos, a diet coke, and one street corn, nothing complicated. Pretty sad considering our first visit was much better. I can think of better places to spend 20 bucks. We did not eat our food at Frijoles; we took it home to reheat."}
{"text":"As you walk in, you'll be greeted by a very friendly staff, eager to take your order and answer any questions. I ordered a Carne Asada salad, two of their popular mini al pastor tacos, and a large spinach cucumber water to-go. Every single item ordered was delicious, containing fresh ingredients, and generous portions for the price. My order came with five variety mild salsas. That would be my only complaint, or request.  A spicier salsa is key to accompany tacos, and I was sad to not see any limes. I'd still recommend this place, and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have great expectations,  but they let me down,  i order the carne asada salad, w beans,  rice, tomatoes letuce and steak, but the dressing is to watery,  too runny, the steak was blend and the rice mushy,  also get the guac and chips, the chips way to salty, and the guac was bland, need a little lime , cilantro onions or seasoning, just taste like a mash avocados, the staff was very friendly,  thats why i give the 5 stars, i hope you fix it all and for my next visit u will get the corn, (they didnt have it this time), good luck ..."}
{"text":"I wanted Mexican food and was not settling for Cafe Rio so we tried Frijoles for the first time. Staff was friendly but food was lacking in seasoning. We had a party of 4 and we all felt it lacked salt. The beans and rice were the highlight for me. The flour tortillas wrapped in foil wasn't fresh. Th carnitas didn't have that crisp I was hoping to bite into. The steak was thinly sliced done medium. I don't like to try places twice so everything has to be impressive the first time around."}
{"text":"Food is decent - nothing to write home about. I've had better at much cheaper prices. At $4.50 per taco (almost twice as much per taco as other places), I'd expect the food to be phenomenal, but I was left disappointed. Elote was about the best thing here. 

We tried to use the free drink check-in offer. Pulled up Yelp's redeem window and showed it to the lady. She tapped something on there and said \"somethings wrong\". This happened twice until Yelp wouldn't let me redeem the offer anymore. I don't know what she pressed on, but regardless if something was wrong, she could've offered us the deal just for checking in. Instead she offered to give us a cup of water for, in her words, \"only one dollar\", which we purchased. That water never even came. 

First and last time I'm going here. I could have better food and service for much less elsewhere."}
{"text":"Carne asada burrito was delicious, adobada fries were all right. The mango agua fresca was nice. The inside has plenty of seating and the service is very friendly. Order took a little long, but ingredients were definitely fresh. Will come back to try other things."}
{"text":"Very good affordable Mexican food. It is very similar to Los Tacos. Their elote is delicious. Everything I have tried has been pretty good."}
{"text":"Me and my wife were looking food a good mexican  place to eat dinner so we herd of this place from a friend  and came. I must say its worth it. This was our first time  here and we will be coming back soon with my parents. Being in the f &b industry  im very picky and im huge on how things are done. This place is very clean friendly  and the workers are clean up to health code standards and its an open kitchen  which i love you can see them prep food,cut meat everything. Very reasonable price  on home made mexican  food great good frijoles you got me coming back for some great food. This place is must try restaurant  trust me you will be wanting  more."}
{"text":"Food is alright. I'm very picky when it comes to Mexican food cause I'm Mexican so I know how some things should taste. I don't like things that don't appear fresh. This food is always okay. I do however like to come here for their aguas frescas. Very refreshing and just the perfect amount of sweetness."}
{"text":"I don't know where to begin. I had the taco salad with fish, delish! My buddies had 2 different burritos on the menu and were both very expressive on how good they were. I can't imagine everything on the menu isn't that good. Pico that comes with the chips, very tasty! Can't forget the on table salsas, both had a little heat but great flavor. With Fresca being in the name you have to try them right ... oh yes! We all shared our 3 different flavors watermelon, strawberry, and pineapple wow, wow, wow. You might as well have just stuck a straw in the fruit and drank away, sooo refreshing! Annnddd, I can't pass up a churro and I hope you don't either, personally the best I've ever had! This was my first visit and I'm already planning my next trip with other friends and family, gotta share this exciting find!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!!

Great food. The chicken and carne asada tacos are wonderful. The gooey melted cheese on a warm corn tortilla, with pico de gallo, guacamole, sour cream and beans. It's perfection!

I don't know how they cook their beans but they are AMAZING. Their bean and cheese burrito is the best I've ever had. So much flavor in such a simple burrito. Everything here is GREAT. It all tastes healthy and yummy. One of the best Mexican restaurants in the valley. I hope Frijoles expands and goes national!"}
{"text":"Great food! I usually get the al pastor tacos and street corn & of course an agua fresca. The salsas are so good and not too spicy. The employees are always very nice and fast"}
{"text":"Just went for the first time and it was so worth it. Nice servers, clean restaurant, enjoyable ambiance. The server actually recommended a menu item that avoided my allergy. The food was fantastic and I Loved the street corn!!"}
{"text":"Fresh! The menu includes authentic Mexican street food but in a nice restaurant. We tried some tacos and burritos. The al pastor pork was fantastic. I like cilantro and they put cilantro in their burritos. Excellent! You can't go wrong with the agua fresca drinks. Horchata-pineapple and horchata-strawberry were great combinations. The guacamole and chips were good and the guacamole was fresh. The owner was working when we came and the service was great. A very personable and outgoing guy.  Try this place out, there are a lot of choices to keep you coming back."}
{"text":"Not impressed took almost 25 minutes to get out carne Asada fries. I overheard the girl say we burnt the fries what do we do.  Out Asada fries have hardly any fries I have literally 1 pound each of guacamole and pico de gallo. I wanted Asada fries not a guacamole plate. Very disappointing Will probably never be back"}
{"text":"I had heard about Frijoles from some friends, and honestly it exceeded my expectations. I ordered the two taco plate, and substituted chips and salsa for the beans and rice. The marinated pork was really good. Definitely coming back. Prices were very reasonable. 

Once a friend ordered the street corn I had to have some, and it was delicious. Well done and authentic."}
{"text":"Best Carnitas tacos EVER!!! Our family has been coming here since grand opening day and eat here at least twice a month.Their cheese quesadillas are amazing and the strawberry horchata is delicious! Their customer service is some of the best, they remember us each time. Very family friendly restaurant."}
{"text":"YUM.... TOO DELICIOUS! This spot is by our house, and has become our favorite go-to for awesome authentic Mexican food. They have a smaller menu then most Mexican spots in town (no tamales, enchiladas, etc;), but really hone in on serving deliciously seasoned and well prepared meats. 

The location is very clean and perfect for a quick bite, but we typically order the food to-go. They also carry fresh fruit juices called aguas frescas; my favorite flavor is the Jamaican, which mimics a hibiscus.  

We adore their mini tacos, which come served with onions and cilantro. They have a wide selection of meats including: carne asada, pollo, carnitas, al pastor, camaron, pescado, lengua, cabeza, and also vegetarian. The carne asada, carnitas, and al pastor are our favorites.

 We also really enjoy their platter plate, which serves the meat (I get carne asada) as a fuller portion, with rice,beans, avocado, and a salad as added sides. We love to get extra flour tortilla with this and basically make custom fajitas. They have awesome sour cream to add as a side, and a great green cilantro sauce with the salad.

 The al pastor quesadilla is also a favorite of ours, with chips & guacamole always being a must-have. The street corn is phenomenal, and I always ask for light sauce extra cheese. They also have fantastic salsa, and also amazing green/red sauces (spicy!)

I have not had anything I would not recommend here, but have not yet ventured to try their cabeza meat, or fish & shrimp entrees. Soon I will try their ceviche as I have heard good things. Everything is extremely fresh, and made homemade. You can tell the food is authentic and their is love within the preparation.

Our to-go orders have always been done efficiently, accurately, and packaged for easy travel. I would recommend this place to anyone, and can't wait to go back myself. Both lucky, and cursed this is by our house!

{"text":"My family and I really enjoy coming to this place. The food is always fresh and great tasting! I have not had anything bad here. Their fresh made juices are delicious and compliment the food. The staff are very friendly and make it very inviting and enjoyable. Plus I also like that the place is always clean."}
{"text":"Healthy Mexican food- sounds like an oxymoron, doesn't it?
With a name like Frijoles, I was expecting canned refried beans and other quintessentially unhealthy Mexican dishes here but was pleasantly surprised!

Interior of this former Pizza Hut is totally transformed with upscale seating and lighting fixtures and some Aztec decor, and piped-in music fits perfectly with the ambiance here. Wish they had to space to add in a patio!

Menu is simple: tacos, burritos, nachos, and various other dishes, pick your meats, plus additional sides (ELOTE!) and drinks (AGUAS FRESCAS!)

Initially came in for just a snack- got the lengua nachos, street corn, and a watermelon agua fresca. Both were delicious and fresh, and I really appreciated how the nachos were not drowned in cheese but remained relatively light with pinto beans, guac, and pico de gallo. Loved the corn! Prefer it chopped off the cob but flavors were spot on.

Owner came out to introduce himself and tell us about his new place. In addition to amazing aguas, he also does juices- gave us samples of the pineapple, the strawberry, chia, and spinach. 
My next visit, I'm going to try to convince him to start bottling and selling his juices for home consumption- they were delicious and all-natural with no additives, and the guy is really knowledgeable about juicing and nutrition.

This place isn't what you expect- in a GOOD way!
EDIT: Have since returned for many aguas frescas, tacos, and quesadillas. Some of the best fresh-Mex in Vegas. Consistently high quality, good portions and prices, always stellar service."}
{"text":"I ordered here a few months ago, it was honestly the best Mexican food I've eaten in a while. Very fresh, very delicious and they were friendly. I love their frescas, I got a watermelon and strawberry one and I got a carne Assad quesadilla and elote, with fried ice cream (don't worry me and my boyfriend shared all this food) but it was amazing. Usually fried ice cream is bland and soggy but it had crunch and flavors of cinnamon in it. Good job! I recommend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"We had carne and shrimp both made fresh- loved it. Also the cucumber drink was excellent- very refreshing. Service is great!!"}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious Mexican food. I love this place. Everything is so fresh and not greasy.  Everything I have ordered has been delicious. Make sure you get an agua frescas!"}
{"text":"Not sure what some of the reviews were for but the food was GREAT! Aguas frescas too. Place was very clean good people and good music"}
{"text":"Awesome food!!!!! If you ever drive down Charleston, you have to stop by here! Very authentic and delicious:) if I wasn't moving soon I would become a regular!!"}
{"text":"Many of my friends and family encouraged my husband and I to go here and get what they deemed the best Mexican food around for a good price. 

When we got there we informed them it was our first time there and needed time to look over the menu. While deciding what to eat, they gave us samples of the different frescas that they offer. We tried all of them being the adventurous people we are, and I would never drink cucumber or spinach again, both were terrible. Their frescas are the only reason I even gave them a star, that and Yelp doesn't give you another option. 

I ordered a steak burrito with avocado on the side and my husband ordered the chicken nachos. Now, let me say that we've eaten at many establishments prior to coming here, so our expectations were a bit higher because everyone told us how it was better than X, Y, or Z. So, we got our chips and salsa and his chips and guacamole. He said the guacamole had decent flavor but the salsa on the other hand had no flavor. I'm used to salsa, not pico de gallo, and even most pico de gallo's have good flavor, where this did not. 

Then our food arrived. It all looked good, but the first thing we both noticed was the amount of greasy cheese on his nachos and the beans. Now, I know that they make their own beans, but they are disgusting, in our opinion. My burrito was covered in them as were his nachos. We ate around them as best as we could, but it was difficult seeing as how it was on everything (hence the name of their establishment). 

As we both got sick after eating here, we will not be returning again."}
{"text":"This spot is so good. Best agua fresca, spinach is my favorite the tacos are really good and the eervice is so nice."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem!  The food here is fresh and just amazing.  The shrimp cocktail had just the amount of shrimp.  These weren't your typical small shrimp other places serve.  The mini tacos are delicious.  Used the check in and received a soft drink for free.  On a full stomach back to San Diego in a full stomach.  I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I've gotta hand it to this restaurant, its impossible to say their food is sub par as, it is tasty, excellent in every way but ONE MAJOR problem, which over shadows the whole experience - PRICEY!!!!! We are talking about tacos people - TACOS, we're not saving babies here, just cooking up tacos and $20 bones for 4 tacos is in NO WAY justified - PERIOD."}
{"text":"I believe in second chances. And I better, since it's literally in my neighborhood. I tried the shrimp salad, the cheese quesadilla. And, I also finally tried an Agua Fresca! The food was great. The shrimp salad was a great value. I needed to update my previous review- this a Mexican restaurant, with a better quality of food. You get what you pay for. And it's a good thing."}
{"text":"The food is excellent! Carne Asada  smells and tastes delicious, tacos are big, the pastor meat was very good too, place was busy but worth the wait! Only thing is not they don't have  servers, you order and pay they give you a plastic number and someone brings you the food, i say is a great place and meal for the price, elote (corn on the cob) are great!"}
{"text":"I love Mexican food so I had to try this place out. So glad I did! Yummy. I had the chicken taco, it was excellent. Chicken was fresh with a great grill flavor, pico de gallo was awesome and the guacamole was freshly made. So good I wished I had ordered two! My husband had the street corn and said it was phenomenal. The fruit drinks are a refreshing add-on. My daughter loved the watermelon. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Excellent tacos and great fresh juices with superb customer service makes this place one of the best taco shops in town. The quality of this restaurant earned its 5 Star rating. I was really impressed that I plan on taking my family here next. The Carne Asada and Al Pastor are some of the finest and they give you a lot of meat in the tacos."}
{"text":"This was worth the drive!  Beans were awesome and even my picky kids ate them. Service was fast and price was reasonable. I would have liked it better if they had combo plates but everything is al a carte."}
{"text":"Not a good place to come if you want to stay here all day and they forget what you order .  Then you're waiting . Server asked my mom if she would like some jalapeños , she said yes . Never got them . 
Never been here before , well never never again !"}
{"text":"Waited 1/2 hr for two sides of the Mexican street corn. Eventually I asked why it was taking so long since people who ordered after us with full entrees had already ate and left. They laughed at me very rudely as if I was being ridiculous or something. The receipt said it had been half an hour. We finally get our corn and two bites later we were throwing it away in the trash where it belonged. Horrible service with horrible food."}
{"text":"Yum! This place was delicious! Had the nachos al pastor and they were loaded with meat, cheese, and all the other yummy fixings. Added on the Mexican Street Corn, and it was fabulous! Ended the meal with a hot, delicious churro. Would definitely come back and will tell all my friends about this yummy place!"}
{"text":"Just amazing! When food is not the only reason to swing by. The staff here is amazing. Al aye friendly. Always providing samples of the amazing waters. They even remembered my wife's favorites (not sure if she's coming here more than I'm aware of) but the service really does kick butt. 

The carnitas is amazing. Put it in a taco or burrito and you'll love it!"}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh Mexican food! I ordered the chicken salad topped with pico de gallo and OMG it was SO refreshing! I didn't have one but they had all the traditional Mexican drinks and even Coke from Mexico! Will be back"}
{"text":"Everything here wasn't exactly authentic Mexican food, but for what it was, it was still good. It just wasn't very memorable in my opinion. I got the chicken nachos. It was loaded with everything on it and the nachos still managed to stay crispy so I could appreciate that. I also got the elote. The elote was huge and perfectly covered in cheese and chili powder. I feel like it needed more lime juice though. They have a variety of fruit waters which is probably my favorite thing about this place. I got the watermelon and damn, it was refreshing. I can't wait to try the other flavors. I will probably be coming back to this place to try something different and try out the rest of their fruit waters lol."}
{"text":"I finally tried this place out, very fresh flavors so far. Its a nice place to come to and have a decent meal. Street tacos are pricier then reg places but eeeh its alright"}
{"text":"Great food and really good service everyone is super nice here, definitely gonna be back."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite taco shops anywhere. They offer all kinds of authentic Mexican fare, and the quality is consistently top-notch. The cashiers are always friendly and helpful with selecting a menu item. I've been here maybe 5 times now, at all different times of the day and different days of the week. This place definitely deserves to be one of the top rated Mexican restaurants in the Vegas area. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"First stop while here in Vegas! Didn't know what I was getting myself into, got here and the customer service was awesome. Our waitress/cashier let us try allllllll kindsaaaaa mixed frescas. It was awesome! 

I ordered a el pastor burrito and a pineapple, cucumber and lemonade Fresca. Before my order I tried the el pastor and it was delicious, obvious reason why I chose it for my burrito. 

Dove into my burrito and it was great as I expected. Added fried pineapples to it, I suggest you do the same! Great spot, awesome customer service and very clean. Overall 4.5/5. I'm here til Sunday(it's Thursday), I just might be back 1 more time. Great job Frijoles and Frescas! I've never bean more satisfied! (Check their shirts)"}
{"text":"Let me start off by telling y'all.. (pause) ...that the food at this place (pause) ... hella bomb!! I ordered a beans and cheese burrito (yes, basic) but it was one of the best burritos I've had! And yes the aguas frescas is really yummy (I had a strawberry, mango, spinach) but the fact that cashier was nice enough to give me and my hubby a sample of the spinach and other flavors was really cool. So all in all.. the food and customer service are awesome! Most definitely will be here again! Oh and to add to this.. the spot is at the corner of rainbow and trop which isn't hard to find!"}
{"text":"I love frijoles!!! Reminds me of los tacos on Sahara but better! Chicken taco comes decked with guacamole and sour cream. There Pico DE Gallo salsa is mild but you can always dress that up with there green and red salsas, chips are homemade and delish. Aguas Fresca is amazing and you can test flavors out before the commitment of buying. And the elote....... comes out nice and hot and delicious!!! Super fresh and super delicious. Service is fast and lunch time is packed. Parking lot kind is small but worth the hassle if any. It is for sure preggo approved."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite to go.... didn't feel like cooking plus had a taste for some tacos. Ordered the 2 mini taco meal. First time here and I have to say.....  Delicious! The entire meal was very tasty and the watermelon Fresca was so good. The service was great, they greeted you right away and it didn't take long at all for the food to be prepared. Needless to say that I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Ive been wanting to try this place for awhile and i was finally in the area. I tried to think of something i didnt like about this place since i know some people think those who give 5 stars are just being overly generous, but honestly i REALLY enjoyed this place. I got 2 mini tacos (which are a good size) the al pastor and carne asada. My favorite of the 2 was the pork. So good!! Also got a mexican street corn, which was also really good but kind of basic in taste. We also got an order of carne asada fries which in my opinion were good but a bit average. Robertos is bigger with more meat for comparison. Also got a cucumber fresca, amazing. And we took a strawberry mango horchata to go. I dont normally get horchata anywhere but it was sweet almost like a desert drink. Id definitely order it again. The service was great. Cashier was friendly, greeted us and also read back our order before i paid. It took about 10 minutes to get our food and they bring it to you which is nice. All in all, id definitely be back."}
{"text":"An authentic Mexican restaurant should have homemade chips- this place does not. I think the best thing going for this restaurant are the tacos. The meat is perfectly seasoned and portioned nicely. If you do come here I would skip the sides. Rice and beans are alright but everything else is pretty bland."}
{"text":"Aguas Frescas are delicious. Love the carne asada. I usually get the burrito. Always good."}
{"text":"Everything about this place was incredible! The drinks were amazing, the food authentic and delicious, and the service was great and fast."}
{"text":"Clean enviroment, fresh food, good ingredients, their carne asada is grilled as it should be. Kind staff as well. The only downfall the dont close late. But way much better than the other 24hr place."}
{"text":"Good if not amazing choice if you're in the area. Used to be a pizza hut and now is a Mex place that keeps it simple with very few selections such as tacos, burritos and tostadas. I've been here twice and I enjoyed it both times although the first time they did get our order wrong and we didn't notice it until we got back home. We called and they were very nice about it and gave us a free meal when we returned. I liked the carne asada and my gf liked the regular taco and also the minis. Good value as far as portion size/price."}
{"text":"I went here on a Saturday. The cashier lady could have been more friendly seem like she was miserable working there. I order the big taco combo carne asada. The taco was really good. Beans and rice were nothing special. But way to expensive. A big taco is almost $5 by itself. I ordered a side of avocado which was like 4 very small pieces and that was $2 alone. The agua de piña tasted like can pineapple juice."}
{"text":"First timer here :)  I've been to chipotle ( not a fan ) I've been to cafe rio ( a fan) but there's something really special about this place, everyone is soooo friendly ! If you've never been here, you can compare it to chipotle as the ordering goes, but the choices of aguas frescas ( fresh water for ya gringos ) are incomparable and the lady behind the counter was very generous with all the free sample offerings . I chose the pepino ( cucumber ) & sandia ( watermelon) combination and it was so spot on compared to what you would get at your local Hispanic markets ... Just the frescas had me sold :)  

My GF ordered just pepino but they had endless flavors including the following : horchata, Jamaica, Fresa, espinacas, and chia. We both ended up ordering the Mexican salad with pollo. The salad had Mexican style rice and pinto beans, we both eat healthy and the only downside with that is, I wish they offered brown rice and black beans but any- who, it had lettuce tomatoes and a tomatillo dressing. It was good :) then we both shared the Mexican street corn, it was good but not as great as you would get it from the Elote man.. Just saying ... The tables were clean. The staff was nice, but the chile ( hot sauce ) bottles were almost empty. Overall good food, good prices .. We shall return ."}
{"text":"I have driven by this place for years and never stopped in but decided to go for it today. I was surprised at how good the food was. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So I tried this place, and it was just okay. A step above Roberto's in my opinion. We ordered the carne asade fries, chips and guacamole, and the al pastor burrito to share. The inside of the burrito was wet. I am assuming it was from the beans, but I don't like wet burritos. The beans overpowered the flavor of anything else, so unfortunately I can't say whether or not the al pastor was good. Next time I would order the burrito without the beans. The fries were fine, I liked the flavor of the carne asada. The chips and guacamole were good. The guac was fresh and the chips appeared to be made in-house. 

The service was just okay. The workers seemed bothered when we would ask for a drink (soda) refill. I hate when the drinks are behind the counter instead of self serve. I understand the agua frescas and horchata being behind the counter, but the soda fountain?? Also there was no salsa bar. They did have 2 salsa's on the table though, a red and a green. My suggestion is to put a salsa bar and have the beans on it, since this place is called Frijoles.  Also, bring the soda fountain out to the front. Maybe I  would come back for the shrimp cocktail that looked really fresh, and possibly the elote.

Yelp 2015 Review #15"}
{"text":"I'm so glad a friend recommended this to us. These are authentic street tacos. The Carne asada is delicious.  You should also try the rice and beams which are authentic and flavorful. The price is inexpensive.  The restaurant is clean and open so you can watch your meal being prepared."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Service was a bit slow though. Will gladly eat here again next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I think this is my favorite new spot. Wonderful food and staff. Update: Never posted this. On our way back, hoping it's still as good!! I'm sure it is!"}
{"text":"Second time here, and this time I ordered the shrimp cocktail that I coveted the previous time that I saw somebody else ordered.  It was REALLY good!  However, I ordered the large one, and it was really too much food... the regular sized one would have been plenty.  The tacos are top notch!"}
{"text":"I searched high and low for some elotes con vesa!!  And I finally found them for $2.50 and bought way too many. I tried the cheesecake chimichanga too which was absolutely delicious ! And friendly staff too. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"The best place in vegas yum yum 

We come here all the time and just gets better and better!! You have to come here for the food and service."}
{"text":"My name is Doug and I'm a Fish Tacoaholic. I am helplessly addicted to these amazing tasty fish tacos. Stuffed full of all kinds of goodies. No wimpy tacos here. Don't plan on keeping your hands or face clean. Not for girly men.
Can't say that I have ever seen a man working there. These women are fast, friendly, and make some killer food. Keep up the good work!
I once was getting the shakes for one of these tacos on a Sunday. They are closed Sundays. I went somewhere else. I was seriously disappointed. The good news is, I went back the next day to get the good stuff."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with our Grandkids after soccer and football games.
Food is served fresh and hot. Tacos are stuffed with meat, salsa and avocado and are delicious.
The burritos we ordered were excellent.
Chips and salsa are very weak, small with a tiny cup of salsa and no refills. They also charge for soda refills.
Those 2 items and the not so friendly service held the review down to 3 stars"}
{"text":"Been here before and service was great this time I made a phone order for pick up for lunch time for my co workers and I. The lady who answered was rude, didn't even tell me how much my total was for either of the orders. Didn't tell me in how long my food was going to be ready in. I specifically asked for roasted chili and onions. I get there to pick up she was rude looked like she didn't even want to work there. Handed me my food forgot two of my drinks until I reminded her and I had to ask for a cup holder bc I ordered 3 drinks. Get to work check my order and they forgot to give me the onions and chili and gave me no lime for my tacos?! Seriously, I'm beyond disappointed"}
{"text":"This is the best place of food in Vegas to eat  fresh food realy good taste fresh flavor water super nice people"}
{"text":"Honestly my favorite Mexican place in vegas , feels like comfort food, amazing menu , personally the fish tacos are the best thing for me , green salsa is a must ! Enjoy !"}
{"text":"The food is great but this cashier that is during the nights has horrible customer service, talks to customers like they're stupid and never even makes eye contact, she has curly hair and she always really rude.. i believe her name is Rocio."}
{"text":"Their food all looks and tastes very fresh. I had fish tacos and their salad and will definitely try this place again. Better than chipotle and cafe rio just a further drive."}
{"text":"The Skinny: while the aqua fresca and the meats are good,  I'd pass on the fish, beans, rice and chips (3) service: slow for a fast casual spot with counter service ,  waited 25+ minutes to get any of our food and drink (2), value: it's okay but nothing I am going to rush back for (3).

We stopped by this joint completely starving. Eager for some good Mexican,  we were jived about this place being relatively close by. 

We ordered 5 different styles of street tacos($2 each) , a side of beans and rice($2),  and an order of chips and salsa($2). We also got a mixed strawberry/pineapple aqua fresca ($2.50). 

After we ordered,  it took a while for the food and even aqua fresca to come out. I believe there was a mix up with our drink which didn't arrive at our table a good 15-20 minutes after we ordered and only after we pointed out we never received our drink. Bear in mind that the restaurant was only about 1/3rd full at 1:40pm on a Friday. This is not a joint where you get in and out quickly. 

Finally the food arrived and we devoured it quickly. The good points? The meats, in general,  are solid. The lengua had a nice texture and was flavourful. The carnitas was mildly crispy and tasty. The carne asada had a nice smoky taste but I found it be a bit watery. Al pastor was good but a bit too salty. 

The fish taco on the other hand was not quite what we expected. Instead of a whole piece of fish,  it looked like some canned tuna sparsely mixed in with a whole lot of pico de gallo. Meh, the fishy taste and super wet texture really didn't do it for me. I would skip this and order a meat taco instead. 

For me,  the beans and rice tasted pretty generic. The beans were lacked adequate seasoning while the rice was just okay. 

While their pico de gallo is pretty great,  their chips were subpar. Some chips were overdone while some were not even crispy and were oddly chewy. I think I'd pass on this. 

The highlight of the meal was the aqua fresca. The strawberry/pineapple tasted really fresh and housemade. For $2.50, that isn't too bad. 

Overall,  given service and the hit or miss items on the menu,  this joint is just okay in my books. I don't know if I have a strong urge to return given the plethora of great options. 3 starred review."}
{"text":"Very tasty food. Keep in mind if you are vegetarian that the beans are made with pork fat. Which in my opinion are the best tasting beans ever!"}
{"text":"I noticed that I'm secretly addicted to this place. 

Is it because of their deliciously seasoned lengua? Their interesting take on the meat + fries? or is it because of their watermelon juice?

I don't know! but those are the usual items I order. Meat + fries is totes amazing. Cause you can get different types of meat (chicken, asada, pastor etc). 

This place gets busy around lunch on the weekend. So if I were you, definitely stop by after 2 or 3 pm.

Check in and get a $1 off drink! Or something like that."}
{"text":"Nice little gem in this town full of cheap Mexican food. 

I ordered the el pastor burrito. Nice juicy flavorful meat, fresh avocado, delicious beans, and a great cilantro salsa. The house made red and green hot sauces really kicked it up.  

My date got the steak quesadilla, and I was jealous. Huge portions of fillings, with great flavor. The tortilla was fresh, and plenty of cheese too!

The order gal figured out it was our first time, so she gave us a sample of EVERY fresca they make. There are some really great flavors(9 of them!), and I'll be stopping in next time I want a cold drink. Their spinach fresca rivals what you might get at one of those fancy juice places, and they're only $2.50. 

She also brought us one each of their chicken and carnitas tacos, on the house! Really great street style, but with good salsa, cheese, and crema. 

I'll be back for sure. This is what cafe rio and friends strive to be, and nearly at Roberto's prices. Definitely give it a try if you like Baja style fresh Mexican food!"}
{"text":"I've found a new addiction. Los Tacos step aside. They have mini tacos, elote, and agua frescas that put Frijoles above the rest. And let's talk about those Frijoles! They get at least 5 stars. The chips, tortillas, red and green salsas are definitely something to talk about. The kind of kick that sticks to your tongue and makes your nose run, but doesn't have you running to the counter asking for leche. Did I mention they have elote? It had the perfect combination of flavors with enough juicy goodness to appreciate the charred kernels. We generally opt for the courtesy cup of water, but we're persuaded to buy an Agua fresca after numerous samples of various concoctions were offered."}
{"text":"NO WAY this place is worthy of a 4.5 star average. This is an overpriced Taco Bell. Tastes like it too.

We got a cabeza burrito and al pastor burrito. I love real Mexican food so whenever I see lengua and/or cabeza on the menu I get excited. The cabeza had no flavor whatsoever. Super bland. The al pastor wasn't that tender and also under seasoned.  The big problem for me was too many frijoles! In hindsight, ok this place is called Frijoles, and I like beans; I don't want a burrito with 75% beans! And shocker, bland!  The salsas were thin and watery and not hot enough. The only redeeming factor was the tortillas. I liked the chewy texture.

I should also mention it took 15 mins for us to get two burritos when there was only one other party (of 2) in the whole place.

Here's the kicker. When I went to throw away my trash, I saw a dead cockroach on the ground. Whoever cleaned up that night knows this is true.  Roaches freak the crap out of me and are the only bug I'm scared of, and even dead they gross me out. The only reason why seeing a roach at a restaurant didn't get a one star is we didn't get sick.  Whenever there is a roach in the front of the house, you know there is a bigger problem in the back."}
{"text":"5* taco place!!! I got there the best quesadilla in my life! Yummy yummy. Nice clean indoor. Fast and friendly service. Thank you."}
{"text":"I have always wanted too check Frijoles & Frescas Grilled Tacos. It super close to the house and seen that location change so many times over the years. New place need check it out. I heard from my brother that the tacos pretty good. I should have gotten but went with Burrito Meal or number #3. It comes with your choice of protein. I went with the carne asada. Burrito split for me the pros and cons. I love the fact portion size is really nice. Not just burrito everything I ordered get your money worth and more. You get  FULL, HEARTY burrito, and take first bite see loading with beans, avocado, and lot of stuff in it. My con is not much flavor in it. The carne asada itself needed more seasoning and overall all the amount of stuff in it makes nothing stand out. The chips and salsa. WINNAH. The chips taste super fresh and nice crispy right out of the fryer. The salsa love it!!!!!! It not your water down or salsa salsa. It more refreshing salsa lots lots of diced tomato, onion, and cilantro. Honest I enjoyed the chips and salsa the best. I also ordered side of refried beans and rice. Nothing stood out for either no \"wow\" factor. Overall maybe the tacos are on point but right now found the food just ok. 

The service was awesome. The cashier was friendly and explained all my questions great. It open kitchen so if want can see them prepare your food while you wait. Free entertainment while waiting. The menu has nice diversity to choose from typical Mexican fare, even the drinks got nice diversity, and don't forget look at little freezer off side of the main menu board. You might find frozen treat that you like!"}
{"text":"So I had the pollo asada fries, Mexican street corn, chips and guacamole and the pineapple mango agua fresca. Everything was great but my only complaint was with the fries. They were just a tad bit over cooked so they felt more hard and crunchy. My boyfriend got the carne asada burrito and I'm so sure next time I will be getting that. Staff was very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"It's beginning to feel a lot like....summer!!!! Everywhere you go!!! Stumbled upon this place while we were looking up cold beverages. And I'm so glad we did! Hence the name \"frijoles and frescas\" which means....beans and beverages.

You walk up to the cashier and they'll take your order. I love how their menu is on the left side of you, and it's literally in huge letters, so for people who can't see from afar (like me) this made me happy. I ordered the carne asada fries (DUH), and my boyfriend had the shrimp cocktail. For drinks, I had the cucumber/pepino Fresca, which was super refreshing and not too heavy! It's perfect and just right for a hot summer day. My boyfriend ordered the strawberry horchata Fresca, which is just as amazing! It's on the milkier side, which was expected because it's a horchata.

They then give you a number, and you can sit wherever you like while they prepare your food. The lady that took our order, her name was Norma, was very nice and attentive. She came up to us and brought us our drinks and also asked if we would like some chips and salsa. Heck yes! Then our food came out and we indulged!

Just a tip: if you check in on Yelp, they give you a free beverage from the fountain drinks!! 

But I'm telling you, you MUST try the frescas! On the way out, we got a refill of the strawberry hotchata, mango and spinach Fresca all mixed in one!"}
{"text":"Finally we found a great Mexican place to eat. Thanks to the many great yelp reviews, we made this hot spot one of our top places to eat. When we first arrived they hardly had any customers at about 5pm, so we were a little concern. Nevertheless we got right into the menu and ordered our food.

The menu was simple but very tempting. As we sat down to wait for our food, we were offered chips and salsa. The chips were great, but the salsa was borderline. For our main dish, we ordered the carne asada taco with beans and rice. It was loaded with good stuff, like avocado, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes and much more. The flavors were amazing and the beans and rice complimented the plate. We also ordered a shrimp cocktail which was loaded with shrimp and mixed very well. Then to top it off, we ordered the grilled corn on a cob. It tasted just like back home if not better. The strawberry horchata was so sweet, it tasted like a strawberry shortcake in a cup. 

Overall, our visit was good, great place and great food. Now one of our favorites!"}
{"text":"This is one of me and my boyfriends favorite places. They have delicious food and although you order at the counter they are kind enough to walk it to your table which I really appreciate! Their quasadillas are so filling and delicious! I always get a chicken quasadillas,  a cucumber water, and a mexican street corn. My boyfriend always gets something with lengua(sp?). Try the shrimp cocktail! It's worth the price it's amazing we always get it on celebration days. Lol.

I really appreciate the staff here. The manager Francisco is amazing. Always so accommodating and if by chance anything is not 100% with our meal he is always happy to help us & fix it! I also love that they is closed on Sundays to take care of their staff. So cool!! Will be back. Duh"}
{"text":"I tried this place once and being that my family is from New Mexico and Mexico, I grew up on authentic food. I think this is more Americanize. But still good and fresh quality."}
{"text":"So based on the Yelp reviews I came in to try it out for myself. I walked into this spotless restaurant and I ordered my guilty pleasure and once a month craving of nachos, except this time I ordered them with Al Pastor. Can I tell you? These were divine. The meat was smoky, sweet, and tender. The generous amount of guacamole was made with some jalapeno in it and gave the nachos that awesome spiciness I was craving. Oh, and the guacamole? Real stuff, not that neon green stuff you get at other places. The beans tasted like homemade pinto beans, not the refried stuff that usually comes with nachos. Everything on these nachos worked together perfectly. The bottom of the nachos did get a little soft towards the end but that's why you get yourself a fork and call it a day. 

What made this visit amazing (other than the delicious food) was the awesome customer service they're dishing out. I was greeted by a very friendly young lady who proceeded to ask me if I was a first-timer and if I worked nearby (yes, we spoke in Spanish so I had no language barrier issues, deal), she then proceeded to offer me samples of all their aguas frescas (literally, \"fresh waters\"), yes, all of them. One by one I tried them all and, surprisingly settled on the spinach (try it before you judge me!!). Not only is the food a welcome change in this neighborhood, but the friendly service makes this one of the very few places that still know how to talk to a paying customer. 

I will definitely be returning, and taking as many people as I can with me (I'm Mexican, we travel in packs). This food and service deserves to be shared and I promise to do my part. Always in support of a small business!! Anda Frijoles (oh, by the way, that means \"beans\")!!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the best taco places I've been to! The atmosphere is very laid back and casual. The tacos were amazing! Kind of wish the wish the fish tacos were covered in a batter and fried, but either way it was delicious! The only problem I had was that the sauces provided in the table were dirty and close to being empty. Keep the food the same but please fill you the bottles more cos that hot sauce is amazing!"}
{"text":"So so good! I haven't wanted to try a new place my entire pregnancy, but since my regular place had an hour long wait and I REALLY wanted Mexican food I had no choice lol. I found Frijoles & Frescas here on yelp and the pictures made my mouth water. I wasn't sure whether I wanted a burrito or salad and the lady at the counter was nice enough to help me decide. She said that when she was pregnant she was always hungry, but couldn't eat much (which is my exact issue). I went with the asada Salad with a watermelon agua fresca and my husband for two lengua tacos and asada nachos. 

My agua fresca was AMAZING, so fresh. My
Asada salad.... omg perfection. The meat was flavorful and everything just went perfect together. My husband devoured his tacos and he said the nachos were ok. 

We decided to both try the elote, we are from
SoCal and LOVE elote; we have yet to find a place that makes them well.  The lady who helped us earlier made them, she boiled them instead of grilling them and they were just like they came straight from an eloteros cart.

Long story short, we will be back. Eating at 8 months pregnant isn't always fun or easy, but I throughly enjoy the food here. 

Thank you for taking great customer service to the next level. I'm so sad that we didn't catch your name."}
{"text":"Great place! The fresh Frescas are awesome! The chick burrito is so good and has the perfect combo of ingredients( I got mine without cheese and sour cream) the green salsa is so good, with the perfect amount of spice. This is the 2nd time I have been here. Try this place... it will not disappoint! Staff is super friendly."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. (there is no way you can compare Los Frijoles to Roberto's) It is right around the the corner from my house so my husband and I went there for the opening and we loved it! their staff is super friendly, we've often seen the owner in there serving and cleaning tables, talking to people and everything. The aguas frecas are made with real fruit, which is very hard to find. Being mexican I can tell you that if you want real tacos and aguas frescas got to frijoles. the place is always super clean which is always a plus! 

Note: I have a cousin who came from Mexico to visit and we've taken her out to eat tacos to many places and she said that the only place that's even close to the real mexican tacos is Los Frijoles."}
{"text":"Ordered the taco meal with steak, beans and rice on the side, and pink lemonade as the drink.

Incredible flavor lived up to the hype! Taco came bursting with juicy steak, heaps of delicious guacamole, sour cream, and other vegetables. Rice and beans were also well done, not a poorly cooked grain of rice or bean in the whole meal.

It's a very casual spot - you order your food at a counter, they hand you a little tent with a number on it, and bring the food to your table after a dozen or so minutes.

Be warned: for us, portions were definitely smaller than expected at the price, and a meal will leave you hungry (unless you order something very hearty like their burrito or nacho-esque fries)."}
{"text":"The street corn and carna asada tacos were delicious! The fresh mexican drinks are the best. Not sure if it every Friday but they had Marachi. Great service!"}
{"text":"I can't always trust the carnitas meat that I get at restaurants, but this place has been consistently good. It is also true however, that I felt comfortable asking them if the carnitas was all lean meat, which they assured me it was, because they screen out the pieces of fat. If you want refried beans, as opposed to whole beans, you need to tell them."}
{"text":"So the food WAS amazing here and we use to go once a week but the customer service is deteriorating and every time we visit now is a new issue with the staff. Last time I went they shorted us on everything and made everything in such small portions. They get offended if you ask for more salsa as they give you two for a whole family meal. Which might I add they barely fill up now. I get the shrimp ceviche tostada and it keeps getting smaller every time I order it and not prepared as well like they don't even take the time to cut the shrimp in pieces anymore, they will even short you on the tostada and you have to ask for it wtf? They also use latex gloves which most people are allergic to and I had to find out the hard way the other day. Luckily I don't go into anaphylactic shock from it but man you guys handle food, use proper gloves for your customers and people don't want to taste that!!! I use to love this place but after my child getting food poisoning from their beans and chips and my allergy to latex. Then seeing how they want to give way less but have you pay more then other Mexican places it's lost its value for me. I will be hunting for a better place to go now for mexican food."}
{"text":"A co-worker introduced me to this place and I'm glad they did.  I enjoy the types of tacos they serve (meat, beans, sour cream and cheese).  The frescas are great and the place is always clean.  If you're looking for a solid spot for tacos this is it."}
{"text":"This place is so good! I'm half mexican, but don't enjoy mexican food as much as you would think. This place has made me change my mind. 

The street corn is great! The portion sizes are big and I'm always satisfied when I walk out. My favorite is the shrimp plate with the rice and beans. Their juices are to die for!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Food is fresh and yummy, but what really impress me the more is the service, friendly and they alwAys go for the ' wow'"}
{"text":"Very good place! I had the large taco with steak.  Very good customer service.  The large taco is totally worth it, it is pricey 5$ but it has the meat, beans, guacamole, cilantro, onions and salsa, and cheese. I was full from one taco. It is my first time though, I'll come back to try other things too:)"}
{"text":"Frijoles brings Mexican street food to is essentials and excels at it.  A simple menu prepared with care and fresh ingredients brings out the best.  The meat is cooked to order and the beans have the texture that exudes freshness. Good balance of flavored.  Highly recommend.

Update - I ordered the frijoles and beans last night.  Best beans I have ever had!  Sublime."}
{"text":"Really, really tasty new taco shop. Delicious carne asada, carnitas and al pastor! I will be back again, and again, and again... If you're considering eating here, do yourself a favor and just go and get some delicious food."}
{"text":"Called today to get a gift certificate, because my art teacher loves this place!  He is Hispanic.  Well, the girl that answered had no clue, not only that she said she didn't know if they had them.  REALLY?  You're turning down nicely damn clown!  Oh well, I guess my teacher will get another gift certificate.  I ended up buying a gift card to BJ'S!!  They loved it!!! Toodles"}
{"text":"I was sad Jarachos (not sure of spelt right) closed but boy did I get over that fast after walking into Frijoles and Frescas.
First-different concept..street tacos, ceviche and fresh juices.
I had a watermelon Fresca and yum yum yum! So refreshing! I tried the carne, shrimp and carbon tacos along with a ceviche.
The best taco was the carbon but the others were good too.
The ceviche was A-mazing! They don't skimp on the shrimp and the sauce is fresh and reminds me of  Cabo.
I'll be back and can't wait to share with friends over lunch. Welcome to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"My first time here today but heard it was good and wanted to try it. Food was the bomb!! Fresh and delicious! The sweet lady at the counter knew it was my first time there and let me sample all the frescas they had. These are the best frescas I have ever tasted in Las Vegas.I have had many around town at stands, restaurants and other places but these are by FAR the BEST!!  Everything mixed perfectly!!  I wish they would open one up on the east side. it's hard to find a place with great service, great food AND great prices but they have all three!! Great job!!"}
{"text":"The quality and freshness of an authentic sit down Mexican restaurant at the price and convenience of fast food. AMAZING FOOD!!  

I had the pork quesadilla it was incredible! EVERYTHING is fresh and homemade including the tortilla chips and drinks. They give you sample of the drinks and amazingly my favorite was this spinach concoction. I also had the street corn which was really unique and tasty. This is hands down my new favorite place to eat."}
{"text":"Got a Groupon for this place and it did not disappoint.  Carne asada taco was amazing. The other tacos were ok too. First time eating Mexican corn and it has a very interesting taste but in a good way."}
{"text":"This has become one of my hot spots for tacos! I am a big fan of some good carne asada tacos! I don't even have to ask for lime, they already serve with it! All of their ingredients are so fresh and their salsa to top it off have the right kind of kick! Theirs assorted frescas are a must try. 
I was happy that they have salt & different salsas at the table (the essentials) !!!!

Also, their service is amazing! It's refreshing to see smiles and experience excellent customer service. Norma is exceptional at her job, so kind and helpful!!!"}
{"text":"Good food taste fresh entire staff is very nice and friendly.  Salsa is delicious I am new in the area have been back 4 times"}
{"text":"We drive through Charleston everyday and always see this place so we decided to stop by today. When we got here we liked the set up of the tables and felt spacious. As I ordered I asked the lady whom I was ordering with if their horchata was made here but she said no and mentioned that the Piña, Fresa, Sandia, agua de espinaca(can't remember the other flavors) was made here so I went with the piña (pineapple) it was delicious! I also ordered the chicken nachos and I'll be honest, I wasn't impressed. My partner ordered an asada quesadilla and a taco(also asada) both were decent, but nothing we'd die to come back for."}
{"text":"Frijoles never disappoints . The Al Pastor and Asada tacos are cooked to perfection every time we visit. A side of beans and rice are the perfect pairing, along with one of their top notch Agua Fresca. This is true to the classic Mexican cuisine I grew up with!"}
{"text":"Friend took me tonight .... had the tacos which were good. Very popular place to be tonight. The line was to the door."}
{"text":"Called 16 minutes before closing and they kindly took my order got pick up. Very nice of them. 
Terrific chicken nachos I ate before I could take a picture. :)
The horchata was ordinary. 
Prices are very fair here considering size and quality. 
I'll be back for sure. 
They also offered free samples. So nice."}
{"text":"Love Frijoles! Much cleaner and less hectic than Los Tacos. Very delicious and recognize much of the staff from Los Tacos. The prices are fair and the beans are fantastic. The atmosphere is very nice and love the pallet slat ceiling that was installed, definitely does not resemble the pizza hut it used to be at this location. Tacos are great, the street corn is fantastic and don't have to worry where the street car has been. I have been several times and has yet to disappoint. A must for traditional Tacos and burritos!"}
{"text":"Love the shrimp ceviche tostada here. My kids enjoyed their burritos and tacos as well. We will definitely return for the food. 

One star docked because I was not feelin their watermelon Fresca and strawberry horchata. Not to be harsh, but I am not a fan of artificial strawberry flavor. Watermelon Fresca is usually an easy flavor, but this one was a tad complex."}
{"text":"I've driven by this place a couple times and we finally decided to try it. OMG, can I just say how happy I am that it is so close to my home. We ordered the chicken salad and it was amazing, but the real winner was the aguas frescas. I've never really been a fan but these are to die for. I even like the spinach one. I will definitely come back here - even if it's just to get an agua and not food. It is so worth it. 

The only thing I disliked is the chicken in my salad was a bit burnt and I hate that taste. Just keep an eye on the grill a bit better."}
{"text":"This place is delicious!!! I love their shrimp device tostadas, their salads, and their agua frescas. The food always taste fresh and none of that oily taste. Everyone is very friendly and always greet you the moment you walk in. Definently try this place out!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times and never been disappointed. $1.99 Mini tacos are my favorite. Spinach and pineapple agua fresca is delicios. I've tried all the meats on the menu they're all on point, but my favorite is al pastor. I work in mexican restaurant my self so I know when the food is made from scratch. This is as good as it gets from this concept. The staff is always nice, friendly and efficient.  This is definitely one of my spots when it comes to simple and delicios mexican food."}
{"text":"The carne asada tacos were delicious and filling!! So glad we found this place!!! Can't wait to try other items in the menu. The place was clean and busy (which is a good sign!).  Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"It's ok. Not what I expected. Hard to find authentic Mexican food in this town. Got the pastor fries and a carne asada burrito. Pastor tasted like chipotle chillies. Nothing like pastor. My burrito is more of a \"big flour taco\" for the price you'd expect a decent size burrito. Well at it's another Mexican restaurant experience scratched from my list. On to the next. If you like Americanized Mexican food, this your place. Not my style."}
{"text":"A colleague went with me to see a client so she could peep the lunch scene for our office as I drove... At a stoplight, she looked over & saw Frijoles & Frescas. After reading a few Yelp reviews, we were sold. While the strip mall itself is not, perhaps, the 1st one you'd think to visit, the setup inside is really nice- sort of like a chipotle with the metal & wood. The girl who took our order was super sweet- my colleague sampled each of the 8 frescas & loved them all. In addition to a strawberry fresca, we ordered: el pastor tacos, chicken tacos, carne asada nachos & a chicken salad. We watched the order prepared fresh in front of our eyes (like at a Capriotti's) & it was ready rather quickly. While we waited, there was definitely a solid number of people in & out. Back at the office, we all dug in. I swear, none of us spoke a word- we just inhaled the food! I don't have a single complaint about any of it! But, my favorite was the nachos, followed by the salad. &, because it's fresh, while we were certainly stuffed, we didn't feel sick to our stomachs full. F&F is a kind of a hidden gem- we'll absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"While the food was okay tasting, it made me sick and I can't say I'm surprised. The grease factor was off the charts, which should have been  a warning sign. I didn't even finish my burrito, and I'm glad I didn't. Definitely won't be back. 

Not sure how this place gets great reviews and a healthy image. It's just another greasy Mexican food joint in Vegas. You want real Mexican food in America that won't make you sick, go to Tucson. For some odd reason Vegas doesn't have any worth talking about."}
{"text":"wow oh wow shrimp tostada was out of this world. Shrimp quesadilla was a flavor bomb going off on my taste buds sooooo good!!!! Shrimp burrito my friend had was super delicious. Roasted corn phenomenal! Cannot wait to come back here someday. The staff was so friendly and we got our food in  a timely manner which was great because we were so hungry lol."}
{"text":"SO amazing! I get the veggie burrito, chips and salsa and mexican street corn. The watermelon fresca is sensational! Will be celebrating my bday here this year! Theyre homemade beans are to die for."}
{"text":"Out of this world authentic Mexican food! Took our family of 8 and everyone enjoyed all their meals!"}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was excellent. Don't miss their Shrimp cocktail.  Staff is friendly . The best mexican food in Las Vegas !"}
{"text":"In area is bad, the outside of this restaurant is bad, but if you make it through all that the service is amazing, the agua frescas are fantastic and the taco is one of the best I've had in Vegas. They put a crunchy tortilla on the inside and a soft one on the outside so you get that beat of both worlds bite. Love it here and I would recommend"}
{"text":"Love their fish tacos and mexican street corn.  This was exactly what I was looking for.  Simple and delicious!"}
{"text":"Our first time here and I was greatly disappointed.  I was told good things about this place from a Mexican friend who claimed that it was the best Mexican food in Vegas.  Yeah, that was a bit of an over exaggeration.

First, they messed up our order.  The lady even repeated it and they still shorted us a taco.  We had already driven home and did not want to drive back for one taco.  We just took that loss but not a good first impression at all.

Next, the price.  The burrito is almost $5 and not very large.  Other members of my family also commented on the lack of value.  We've been to other places where the value for the food was much better.

Finally, the lack of taste.  I had the steak burrito and the meat was dry with no flavor at all.  My wife and I also shared a carne asada fries and same problem.  Dry meat plus dry fries.  Also barely any meat.  Again, bad value for what we paid.

I wanted to like this place but instead it turned out to be a big let down.  I've eaten at some good Mexican places but this is not one of them.  We  won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Riquísimo me encanta la comida los tacos Mmm al pastor carne asada todo esta delicioso aguas frescas"}
{"text":"We've been trying to get into this place for weeks. Something about Mexican food for me is that you have to be in the mood for it, stars in the universe have to align just right ,not to mention it helps to be in the area. One thing that caught my eye is their closed in Sunday's, on their door it says we take care of you and take care our employees by giving them Sunday's off (not exact verbiage). 

You walk in and it has a Chiptole or Cafe Rio style type serving method. Assembly line where they take your order along the way. I ordered the quesadilla and a large shrimp cocktail, apparently the shrimp cocktails are bomb ass and the pictures from fellow yelpers looked good to! After you pay they give you a number for your table and you sit your ass down and wait. 

We didn't have to wait long at all, fast service! I wasn't impressed with my quesadilla, I felt they could have filled it up more (picture of inside attached), stingy with the meat! The redeeming factor was the shrimp cocktail. HOLY SHIT! this was definitely a homage to the shrimp gods as I was more than satisfied with this. Tons of shrimp, the flavor was really good to. 

One thing I didn't like was when they brought the food I asked for water and the server just pointed to the machine. It's like really!? After I tipped a few bucks (uncomfortable if you don't, since it's on the receipt and they stare at you). She points to get it myself. I know I know I get it, it's not fine dining but if that's the case then put a tip jar there not a tip spot on the receipt then pretty much tell me to get the drink myself. Cause then your just another fast food place. 

Come here for the shrimp cocktail, it's totally worth the $15, will be returning for this."}
{"text":"Bomb food! everyone is always super friendly! I always come here for lunch! I highly recommend if your lookin for good delicious mexican food!"}
{"text":"Frijoles on Fleek

How you bean? If you haven't heard, this place is YUMazing! We are beside ourselves with how refreshing and flavorful everything is. It seriously tastes like \"healthy\" Mexican food. Everything we taste overflows with bright flavors and is always grilled up fresh-to-order.

Here's a biggie - I don't even like beans, but these frijoles are holy. Home cooked beans made with soul and love from your best friend's grandmother, yup, that's what they taste like. Not too salty, perfectly plump and moist. Nothing I've ever had before, that's for sure. In the span of 2 weeks we've eaten here 4 times already. So good! And so cheap too! A filling amount of food for 2 is always roughly $20. 

The chips and salsa are the first taste of how fresh they are. The chips are freshly fried up and incredibly crispy without being too sharp or hard to bite; the salsa is super refreshing with a slight natural sweetness from the perfectly ripened tomatoes they used. I also splash a few drops of their table-side salsas on my tacos from time to time; though, I prefer the salsa verde (green salsa) for its slightly spicy and welcoming tangy flavor over the simple not so spicy salsa roja (red salsa.) Also, their guacamole is super fresh and vibrant, it really steps up the taco and burrito game. 

I always go for the mini taco combo meal with either carne asada, al pastor - or both, if i'm feeling frisky. The meats are always grilled up perfectly charred and juicy. They are right-on with the seasoning too. The combo comes with a side of frijoles and mexi rice - man, those guys truly give them away as the real deal! You can't get beans and rice as good as this anywhere on this side of the valley. 

The burritos and quesadillas are no-joke delicious, they are packed perfectly with all the good stuff: juicy meat of your choice, fluffy rice, best beans of your life, sour cream, fresh guacamole, and magic. The most important thing about their burritos and the quesadillas are that they are perfectly proportioned - the right ratio of meat to rice, to beans. This is taken for granted, but it's an art form and Frijoles always gets it right. 

Their churros are freaking fantastic! Freshly fried, crisp, yet soft and fluffy in the middle rubbed with a boat load of cinnamon & sugar. Yeah. That's right. They do not skimp on the good stuff! /heavybreathing 

We also tasted their nopal salad (cactus salad) and the elote (street corn) - Maybe not my favorites, but they are not bad at all. The cactus salad comes out warm and is just like a chunky salsa, great for dipping chips. I felt that the flavor was weak though, nothing too exciting. If you never tried nopal before, I would say it kind of tastes like okra without the syrupy liquid, fairly mild. The street corn is also too mild in flavor for my liking, but the corn is charred up perfectly, naturally sweet and plump.

And don't even think about leaving without trying their fresh agua frescas - especially their horchata - my absolute favorite! Slightly sweet and not too watered down either. If you can't decide, you can mix 2 flavors and get a gorgeous marbled effect in your drink. I love it!

PRO TIP: if you are thrill-seekers like we are, make sure to request some grilled serrano chilies and onions when you place your order - Crazy spicy! Super flavorful! Makes the meal 10x better!"}
{"text":"A co-worker and I are in town on business and we wanted to find something a little different and avoid chain places or the strip. This place was great. He had a burrito and I had the steak nachos. I'll come back on my next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"Delicious food! I got the #2 mini tacos meal, carne asada, my bf got the al pastor quesadilla. 
My biggest pet peeve when having tacos is the meat is usually just fat chopped up mixed with a few good pieces of meat... Not here all the carne asada meat was actually meat! Love it!"}
{"text":"I waited 40 minutes for asada fries. The asada fries had no meat, you have to look for it into the fries. Food was already cold and the pico de Gallo salsa wasn't fresh, the tomatoes looked old. Waitress was unprofessional and definitely the manager needs to take a look at all times. I came in the lunch time hour but still not acceptable."}
{"text":"After trying this place I kinda don't blame the thieves for breaking in. The tacos are that good ! But seriously kids stay in school, don't steal"}
{"text":"Good food, great service. The aguas Fresca's are delicious. I definitely recommend the pineapple cucumber."}
{"text":"Heard about this place from the viral video \"I need a taco\" so I came to support.  Located in the old red barn Pizza Hut on Charleston, it took us a moment to decide.  The prices were reasonable alacarte or also available in a combo with chips salsa and a drink. After items are ordered they are brought to the table with a number. 

I took the AL pastor nachos a basket of crinkle cut fries,  and a bean and cheese burrito. Items came to table quickly and serve in green baskets and the nachos were on a plate. Nachos were a good portion and all toppings were arranged in a stripe pattern instead of layers on top of each other,  I'm guessing to look like a Mexican flag with green, white, and red. They were ok. The frijoles were traditional pinto beans but I felt could have used more seasoning. I also prefer black beans but I'm not that picky. 

The food was definitely fresh, while we were there they were grilling peppers and tamatillo's to make some fresh salsa.  Overall I think it was 3.5 stars nothing to be fanatical about but a good place for a quick and inexpensive meal. I want to come back to try a few of there tacos and there Frescas."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic. Especially for the price. The agua frescas are amazing. I have been twice. The first time I had a taco with the pork. Delicious.  The second time I went, I had a salad with the carne asada. Delicious. The Mexican street corn was fantastic.   I have a feeling no matter what I try there, I am going to like it. The staff is also very friendly."}
{"text":"Everything we had was DELICIOUS!!! We ordered mini tacos (carne asada, chicken and carnitas) with rice & frijoles/chips & salsa. Salsa tasted freshly made.  Finished it off with Churros. Seriously, best Mexican food we had in a while. In love with their rice & frijoles. Our picky 6 year old even finished off a bowl of their rice.  They were very friendly and helpful. Already thinking of having lunch there tomorrow."}
{"text":"Food was meh, i think the tacos here are overpriced. But the servers were very nice and offered me lots of samples!"}
{"text":"First time every going to this place and I was extremely pleased! Their agua fresca is delicious and they're always willing to let you sample. As for foods, their elotes (street corn) is amazing and the portions are huge. The tacos are pretty standard, but there's nothing wrong with them. The real standouts are the drinks, and be sure to mix and match different flavors!"}
{"text":"Lunch at frijoles &frescos grilled tacos was very God the food was excellent and the staff was very good too bodacious"}
{"text":"Great food, great service and the best strawberry/watermelon waters.  My fav is the coctel de camaron it is super yummy."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints: fresh, clean, simple and authentic. I applaud their consistency and top notch service. The fresh juices are the cherry on top of an always delicious meal. With all the great Mexican food we're spoiled with in this fine city, Frijoles & Frescas will always be a top five favorite of mine."}
{"text":"First time at this location and the consistency did not disappoint. Best priced Mexican food in the city for the quality. Inviting staff is always happy to please. This is my new favorite Mexican food joint in town and it shows as every time I dine @ Frijoles I have myself a small feast. =)"}
{"text":"Simply loved it!!! Everything was Perfect including the customer service only downfall was the tables were a little dirty but it was busy!! Great customer service awesome food!! Will be back !!"}
{"text":"This little whole in the wall is amazing. Family owned and authentic. Choice of 5 styles of beef, pork and chicken. Amazing hot sauce and just good food."}
{"text":"The agua frescas were good.  But not enough to bring me back.  Let me explain. 

I ordered the al pastor nachos at about 4pm last Friday.  At that time, 4 employees were obviously on their break and eating at one of the booths.  2 employees were behind the counter.  It wasn't busy.  So 2 employees were sufficient.  

I ordered at the counter, paid, took my order #, & grabbed a seat.  While waiting for my nachos, I went through emails on my phone.  Every now & then I would glance up to check on my order. 

The same gal who took my order & money also assembled my nachos.  She was in the midst of dumping watery beans onto the tortillas when I noticed her.  I paused in reading my emails to watch.  She then added al pastor from a warming tray.  There was a trompo with al pastor spinning in the corner.  Why didn't I get *that* meat?!  Next came cheese & off it went into the kitchen to be melted.  She brought it back out & added the pico de gallo, guacamole, crema, & brought it to my table.  

I took a bite...flavorless.  I added green salsa.  Still flavorless.  Red salsa.  Same.  This would be a great dish for someone on a bland diet.  The only thing that made this dish palatable was the Tapatio hot sauce.  Sad. 

So I may not have ordered the best dish and was considering trying a different dish.  But while I was eating, I watched  the same gal who took my order & assemble my dish go from task to task without changing gloves!  Gross! 

I don't think she had gloves on when she took my order.  But, I'm not 100% sure about that.  Wish I could remember for sure.  She did, however, have gloves on when she assembled my plate.  Then she continued to wear the same pair to take out the trash, clean around the warming trays, stir food in the warming trays, and help the next customer who came in.  

I already wasn't impressed with my nachos.  But I completely lost my appetite after watching her.  I threw almost the entire plate away & confronted the worker about changing gloves.  She said she forgot.  Hmmm...how often do you forget to do this?! :/  It wasn't even busy!  I didn't want to involve management on this & get her in trouble.  I just hope that by confronting her, she (& other employees) will be more careful next time. 

This unsanitary practice probably happens more often than not in a lot of restaurants.  Ignorance is bliss.  Seeing it with my own eyes though?...I can't deal.  I can't unsee it & therefore, can't come back."}
{"text":"Meh. Just meh. I wish it had been more. The chicken was good, carnitas were dry and not flavorful at all. Staff was disinterested and subdued. Rice and beans were ok. All in all just seemed like a chain that somehow got some 5 star reviews somehow. If you are in the neighborhood stop by and grab a bite but don't go out of your way hoping for great food and smiling service."}
{"text":"First time trying this place out. My coworkers and I decided to go here for lunch.  I've read the reviews and saw the pics.  The prices are low and affordable and you get a lot of food with it. The food is made fresh and brought out to you. I ordered the fries with Carne asada, Pico de Gallo, and a ton of guacamole! I couldn't finish it all it was so much food. My coworkers had a taco Fujii of meat, and a huge burrito! We will definitely be back to try the other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here on a friends recommendation and I am so glad we did! I absolutely love al pastor and theirs is my new fave. They have it roasting in the front with fresh pineapple, and man ... whatever marinade they use is amazing. The food is fresh and great portion sizes. Not super greasy like some places. Close to the CSN campus, my new go-to Mexican spot!"}
{"text":"I ordered some asada fries. I usually eat half of Robertos, not these fries. These fries where half the portion. The only good thing was the service."}
{"text":"Family of 4 went there for dinner tonight. Staff was friendly and the food came out pretty quickly even though they were very busy. I had the shrimp burrito, while the rest of the family got the carne asada burrito. Mine was delicious and my family enjoyed their burritos. We also tried the carne asana nachos, which were excellent. The chips were homemade and very good. All in all a good experience and we'll be back. Only complaint I had, which is not at all the owners fault, was the family with 5 kids too many. If you're going to take your family out to dinner and bring your small children be courteous of those around you. Parents were too busy talking to each other to notice their kids running around screaming in the restaurant. So rude! If you can't control your children in a public place, stay home!!"}
{"text":"Simply stated fresh,affordable great tasting food. The shrimp tacos are new and are the bomb! Forget all other taquerias....this is the best. The fresh fruit waters are excellent ...(aguas frescas) try the healthy spinach drink very good!!! The staff is so nice and attentive ..luv this place"}
{"text":"Was craving Mexican and Yelp led us here. I don't eat beans so how ironic I came to a place called Frijoles and ordered with \"no beans\".

I got the chicken salad. Although it not taste bad there was no special flavors that popped out. It did come with a lot of ingredients In it so that was appreciated. I also got Ceviche which also had no special flavors to it. It was just shrimp and avocado. It was a little too sour for my tests buds. I know ceviche is made with lime but mine could use a little less lime. 

The street corn didn't contain enough mayo, cheese or chile (or whatever they put on it). The chips and salsa was a good start through. It had the right amount of spicy to it.

The workers were all very kind and attentive. Did not have a bad experience but I wouldn't come here for another mexican meal."}
{"text":"I am a white woman that loves Mexican food and they have great beans here :) Loved the cucumber water soooo good."}
{"text":"Had pollo quesadilla was the best quesadilla I had in long time....fast service...good costumer service loved it...will go back again :)"}
{"text":"Great, delicious, savory tacos! I will be back many times . Definitely has an authentic flavor."}
{"text":"What a great concept!  Appealed to both the Latinos and Gringos in our group.  Flavorful and inexpensive.  Must try the agua frescos and the carnitas quesadilla."}
{"text":"Finally, someone gets it. This place has not disappointed me, and I grew up in mexican food mecca (San Diego) and lived in LA so I know what I'm talking about.  

Burritos: 
Three weeks ago I ordered a carne asada burrito. Excellent quality meat, a great marinade and a good sized burrito for about one dollar more than the cheap hole in the walls charge. The ingredients set it above and beyond all other places I've tried, which is about 12-13 other places (I was searching for my go-to place). 

Two weeks ago I had a carnitas burrito, double meat. Excellent and didn't skimp on the extra meat. The carnitas were still the best I'd had in town, but not ever. The carne asada was on par with the best carne asada i've ever had, though.

Came in today and got a double meat carne asada burrito. Again, perfect, large. Inspired me to finally write this review.

Salsa:
The red salsa is not spicy, but has a lot of flavor. If I recall my first time here, there are actually two reds and one green. The green was alright, but I am biased because verde has never been my thing. One red was darker than the other I believe. None were spicy. That would be my only criticism of this place. There should be a hot hot red option.

Customer service: 
Excellent. I have placed orders via phone twice. Once I called, and nobody picked up, so that was a bummer. But, they promptly picked up this time. When inside, the owner was genuinely nice and excited about his product. He remembered me three weeks later. It really doesn't feel like a Mexican food place because everyone is nice, attentive and everything is spotless. 

A restaurant has to be either incredibly good or incredibly bad for me to leave a review, even though I yelp every restaurant I go to. This earned a review. Check this place out."}
{"text":"Again, this place never fails me...got a #2 combo that includes 2 mini tacos (I got al pastor/marinated pork) beans, and rice and upgraded my drink to a cucumber spinach fresca, very refreshing as always. Service is pretty quick. Went during lunch time so it was pretty busy. Alright, imma enjoy the rest of my meal. Happy Eats!"}
{"text":"The food is really good! The shrimp quesadillas are some of the best I've had, but not your typical quesadilla. I highly recommend trying them."}
{"text":"Went in to see what all my yelpers were talking about and they were right the food was sooo tasty and fresh the best tacos in town  the staff very sweet and kind let me sample all the juice they had to offer all bomb 
....love the short and sweet menu  only taco place for me :*)"}
{"text":"Frijoles is so yummy  if you are looking for authentic Mexican food you must go to frijoles. Aside from the food being so fabulous. The employees are very helpful and nice the location is always clean and you can watch them cook your food."}
{"text":"Went here today for the first time.  It was really good & for sure this is going to be a new regular spot for me to go too.  I ordered 3 things...Bean & Cheese Burrito, Chicken Burrito and a Chicken Quesadilla.   I gave my husband the Chicken Burrito which he said was \"excellent\" and better than Chipolte, which he loves!   I got the chicken Quesadilla without guacamole & it was delicious!   I ate the whole thing.  The bean & Cheese burrito is saved for later as I wanted to get two items in case I didn't like one.  That was just \"ok\".  Next time, I will definitely order the quesadilla again or maybe try the tacos.  The only thing I can say which was weird was the red sauce was tasty but kinda thick & came out in big lumps... not really a \"sauce\".  Not sure if it was a fluke or if it's always like that. ?   Anyway, the restaurant seemed really clean, organized and the staff was really nice & the environment seems welcoming.   I would give it 4.5 stars if you can give a half star.  If the bean & cheese burrito was a little better & the sauce I would have given it a 5.   I noticed lots of people ordering those fresco drinks & I will be ordering one of those next time as well. I am thrilled I found this new local spot!  Go there if you haven't yet!!!

I am back to edit my review.  Went again tonight.  The \"sauce\" was perfect. Have no idea why it was lumpy last week but I am leaning towards a 5 on this place.  How do you give 4.5 stars?  Anyway, I am going to go couple more times and solidify my star rating once and for all for this little gem. 

Also tonight I got a strawberry fresca drink and yes, it is pretty good.  Seems a little creamy-- in a nice way.   Refreshing for sure! I think it's fresh juice so healthy is always great!"}
{"text":"First time tonight, food was fast, fresh and tasted great.   Looks like everything was from scratch.  We ordered the Mexican street corn which was tasty.  Mini tacos were also good.  Daughter had a bean and cheese burrito which she loved.  We shared a carne asada nachos and topped it off with the fresh strawberry and watermelon juices.  We will definitely dine here again!"}
{"text":"I can't emphasize how delicious the food made here is. The freshness and quality of food that this restaurant serves is mind blowing / mouth watering delicious with so much flavor down to the last bite. 

I have introduced over 5 friends to Frijoles and all now are regulars. *Today's visit probably has to be my 30th visit or so between their 2 locations in the last 2 years. I should be a share holder if they had stock. 

Love how this restaurant is Consistent with the Quality of food that they make. The employees have always been very friendly and accommodating. 

The Steak Tacos & Steak Burrito with adding sour cream and guacamole is so darn addicting. 

Pros:
Quality ingredients
Friendly staff
Reasonable prices
Good size portions 
Clean restaurant 

Cons:
None of their 2 locations are not close to where I live 
I wish they had a loyalty rewards card. 
(Like Zaba's & Chipotle have)

{"text":"Best place to come to for real Mexican food! Everything is fresh and authentic! I love the Aguascalientes Fresca so good and with one taco you get full!"}
{"text":"My family and I are absolutely in love with this place!! It was our first time and the workers were very accommodating. Not to mention the food was absolutely delicious!! Wish there was one closer to us though."}
{"text":"Always season to perfection always hits the spot when I'm looking for some authentic food to actually make me full"}
{"text":"Clean and maintained. Chips were good. Very limited menu.  If you don't like frijoles don't go they are in everything even the tacos. Meat was ok (some on the burnt side) what little of it was in the food.   Frijoles aren't my thing so won't be going back."}
{"text":"I met a friend for lunch and we got there at 11:30 to make sure to beat the lunch rush. I am glad we did because even with only a few other customers in the restaurant, food service was slow and a bit awkward. The cashiers seemed a bit frazzled or distracted. About 10 mins after ordering my 2 veggie tacos and aqua fresca I was brought over 1 taco. Guess there was some kind of mix up. So I paid for another taco and about another 10 mins later I got my order. The place is spacious and I like the simple modern feel of the decor. Not in the nicest of neighborhoods so not sure if I would venture here after dark. My food was fresh and colorful. I was however concerned that although the buckets of aqua frescas were surrounded by ice, they didn't have lids on them. That could lead to dust, bugs, hair, and other particles floating down in the drinks.
I think there are other Mexican food places around town that are better."}
{"text":"Hands down absolutely BEST mexican food i have had in the last 6 years I have lived in Vegas! Was greeted with a smile the cashier didn't make it seem like a bother to answer any questions we had, everything was exceptionally clean and every time I looked up during my meal all of the employees were cleaning.  The price was perfect $20/for 2 people plus chips and guacamole!! Everything was fresh and clearly made in house, the portions are big , no grease dripping, great flavor,fresh EVERYTHING!! Definitely my new go to spot!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing, they have all the elements needed for a legit mexican/american restaurant, but their execution was off in a big way. 

Visited Frijoles today with my wife, I ordered 2 chicken tacos with everything but sour cream, chip and guacamole, street corn w/ no mayo, only cheese butter and chilli powder, and an order of rice and beans and a coke. My wife ordered a tostada with no meat, only lettuce, avocado, pico and beans, street corn with only butter and lemon and a sprite. $28.00

We sat down, 10 minutes later they served my tacos, 5 minutes after that we get served our drinks, 5 minutes later we get our chips and guacamole, my wife's tostada and our corn. Then 5 minutes later we realize I never got my rice and beans, so I walked to the counter and reminded them and got that a few minutes afterwards. 

My chicken tacos were very good and very fresh tasting. Both of our corns were flavorless and mine wasn't served with chilli powder. My wife's meatless tostada was served covered in meat and had no pico, she sent it back and got it with no meat, but still no pico. I had to go to the counter again to get a side of pico for her. The tostada was soggy and she barely ate it. The chips and guacamole  were good, my rice and beans were great and my coke was amazing. She liked her sprite, she prefers 7-up.

I would go back, my wife is questionable on going back. I will admit, the staff is nice and pleasant, but are managed very poorly. 

They received a star for serving coke products, so read this as a 1 star review."}
{"text":"This location used to be a pizza hut.

It was lunch time. I have seen the place prepping for opening for awhile now and as I drove by I saw they were open. A new place, gives me a chance to Yelp, turned around and went back to try it.

The staff was friendly, the place was clean, the have red and green sauces at the tables, they were both good.They have a fairly good selection to choose from and a good selection of the Mexican style drinks horchatca, fresa (strawberry), pina (pineapple), mango etc.. They were giving out samples of the drinks.

I had a carne asada burrito, it's just a burrito, no sides, $6.95 plus $1.50 for cup of soda. It was similar to the carne asada burrito at Roberto's taste wise. The burrito at Roberto's is $7.35, but it comes with sides of rice and beans, it includes a drink (lunch special).

The carne asada was too grizzly, several pieces too tough to chew through. When I hit the first piece I spit it into a napkin and continued eating, did the same with the second piece. When I hit the third piece, I was done. I saw them bring out the meat, so they chop it there, perhaps they could cut the large pieces of grizzle out, before chopping it up. Eating shouldn't be a physical challenge. It's a shame since the flavor was good, as I said, the taste reminds me a lot of Roberto's, 

If I was rating just on the burrito I had, it would be one star. I gave the extra star because the staff was great and helpful, more help than I needed, I know enough Spanish to understand the menu and the different drinks. But, more help is better than too little. 

They have a variety of meats to choose from, so the other meats may be fine, I can't say. You may want to give them a try. 

I was really hoping it would be good, because it is convenient and not in with a group of food places, where the parking gets chaotic at lunch time. Since I like carne asada and will eat somewhere else and have carne asada, rather than order something else so I can eat here, I can't see me coming back.

They are new, only open for a couple of weeks, hopefully they will work out the bugs."}
{"text":"Fresh delicious street Mexican food. Very fresh and great depth of flavors. The al pastor pork is quite extraordinary. Second visit and we were as impressed as our first visit. The rice and beans are sublime. Very fair prices."}
{"text":"The name says it all ! I would come here just to get an agua Fresca! Seriously they are amazing and you can get all kinds of combinations! I did Pineapple and watermelon and my friend did mango and pineapple! Omg so good! Would definitely come back and try the cucumber flavor and the horchata. On to food the menu is super easy to navigate and the prices are great here. It's the same prices as these other Taco chains with higher quality food! I ordered the shrimp platter, and the shrimp cocktail. Both were super tasty! The corn we ordered was okay I don't really like the fact that they grill
It cause it tastes a little burnt but other than that I have no complaints. This location was the one on Tropicana and Rainbow! Will be coming back to eat here again."}
{"text":"The food was good.  Place was very casual and it's definitely off the beaten path in Vegas, but if you have a car, it's worth a try."}
{"text":"Tried them out a couple days ago after delivering their food a few times for a delivery app. Reasonable pricing and quantity. I went with 2 mini tacos and a carnitas burrito, no sc. Loved it. Their salsa flavors are a nice addition imo. 

Sadly, 2 days later, while the flavor was there, the quantity was actually poor. The tacos were tiny compared to two nights ago, and the burrito was the smallest burrito I've seen in 30 yrs in any taqueria from San Francisco to Las Vegas, and I've eaten in a lot in that time. I was truly amazed enough to write this review. Cost them a star for now. Hopefully they earn it back with me."}
{"text":"I am from Southern California and found out about Frijoles and Frescas because I saw their awesome commercial on a Facebook post.  Their original location on Charleston was burglarized and they made a fantastic and hilarious commercial from the surveillance footage.

I looked up their website and their pics of their Shrimp Quesadilla looked amazing. I was going to Vegas in a few days and decided to try them (and to support them).

The food is great.  My favorite is the Shrimp Quesadilla.  And the service was outstanding (especially from Patricia who ran the register and gave me and my family samples of every flavor of agua fresca.).

The agua frescas are delicious (watermelon-cucumber is my fave) and they taste fresh.

You can bet that I will come here every time I visit Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I saw your commercial on You Tube, will definately come by to try your tacos. What those crooks did just backfired."}
{"text":"My first time trying this place and there is only one word to describe this place: BOMB! Food is fresh and so good !"}
{"text":"Unbelievably amazing!!!i absolutely love everything about tho place. Let's start with customer service, everyone one there is so nice they let you sample the juices even suggest juices to mix. It feels good to walk in and be recognized and they already know what you are going to order. The food is fresh, cooked to order, perfect amount of seasoning and ingredients. It was so good my boyfriend and I went 4 times in a row with 2 times being in the same day ( I pride myself on knowing good food) my favorite items on the menu would have to be the carne asada quesadilla, and the shrimp salad. My first time eating a salad and not noticing that I didn't put any dressing on it ( just delicious) but the dressing they have is delicious as well. The spinach drink is my fav and sometime I mix spinach with pineapple for more sweetness. And don't worry if you show to the restaurant 10 minutes before closing you still will receive excellent customer services and fresh food unlike other places where you feel like you are an inconvenience and you get the scrappy food.... I cannot rave about this place enough !!!!"}
{"text":"Seriouslythe best burrito I have ever eaten and I dont say that lightly being part Hsipanic and from Southern California (the mecca for Mexican food). Ive been in Vegas for a little more than 10 months and was turned on to Frijoles by someone and got the ceviche pescado for my first try. That was awesome...but NOTHING compares to their Al Pastor Burrito. Its stacked and the pork is awesome. I go here like once a week now. One because its close to my place but two because its pratty damn good. The place is clean and the employees are really nice too. Always fast service even when its packed."}
{"text":"I promised to stop by on my way from San Diego to Utah and I definitely wasn't disappointed. The restaurant was clean and well put together. It reminded me of a homey chipotle, but a whole lot more Mexican. The food is fresh. The view to the kitchen is good. I could see workers chopping up fresh vegetables and fruits for the drinks and salsa . The cashier offered us samples of the aguas frescas, of which they have a large selection. After sampling, my wife ordered a chicken burrito with everything and a mango agua fresca, I ordered a marinated pork salad with a strawberry agua fresca. Our food was delivered to our table within five minutes of sitting down. The food was so fresh tasting and the aguas frescas blew my mind. Every bite was better than the last! The burrito was long and plump unlike the short stubby chipotle ones. My wife loved it and the red and green salsas they offer at every table. My salad appeared like something from Cafe Rio or Costa Vida, but not nearly as wilted or manufactured tasting. It was fresh! It came with what looked like an entire avocado chopped on the top, romaine lettuce, beans, the pork, rice and a green ranch sauce. So amazing! Although, I'm not a Vegas native, I can say that Frijoles is one of the best sin city has to offer."}
{"text":"So I love Mexican food and I am always craving it! I've heard good things about this place, bookmarked and I figured I would go that night to try it. As soon we I entered the restaurant I was greeted and asked if it was my first time there. I replied yes, and the 2 young women at the register made sure I saw their pictures of menu items and gave me samples of ALL of their Fresca juices to try. They were all good. My favorites were strawberry, watermelon, spinach, cucumber, pineapple, and the chia lemonade. I ordered a carne asada burrito meal with a watermelon Fresca. The chips and salsa were just ok. The burrito and juice were good. I will definitely be back. I wish it wasn't so far from me!"}
{"text":"I was craving tacos, we were on this side of town (which we rarely, if ever are) and I enjoyed my visit to their Rainbow location in the past (see my previous review of that location). This location however really lacked customer service. I came in and wasn't greeted... The employee at the cash register was just straightening money out (not urgently, so I wasn't sure if it was even required to be doing at that time?) myself and two other guests stood there and waited. I wasn't offered any of the frescas samples even after I told them I have only been to their business once and was interested in getting one but wasn't sure which flavor to try or get.. I asked for a sample and was given a strawberry pineapple combo, watermelon, and spinach. I asked what was most popular and wasn't given an answer. I placed my order and the girl ringing me up looked very unenthusiastic and just wanted to rush the order along and get me out of there. Perhaps it is because I am a gringo? Perhaps its just because sometimes we all have a hard day? I tried not to take it too personal. We ordered a carne asada burrito meal with an upgrade (75 cents) to a fresca (my husband got horchita) and I ordered the taco meal with an upgrade to a watermelon fresca and another side taco for myself and my toddler to share. I also tried to use the yelp check in for a free fountain drink (I figured my daughter would be stealing my watermelon fresca and why not have another drink in case) They would not honor the yelp deal. The food itself was flavorful (skip the chips and salsa) The taco had plenty of avocado on it which made me happy. I don't know if I am likely to return any time soon however after the (lack of) customer service."}
{"text":"Located on Charleston, just west of Rainbow, Frijoles is a new, almost fast-casual style Mexican restaurant. As others have mentioned, it's inside an old Pizza Hut so it's a pretty good sized location. There's plenty of seating inside and although a few empty tables were dirty, they seem to keep it fairly clean. For whatever reason, they lack a salsa bar and keep the drink fountain behind the counter. I don't understand why as they have a counter type section just to the right of the front counter that would be perfect for a salsa bar, drink station or possibly even both.

On the menu they offer up most of the usual stuff like burritos, tacos and tostadas, but they also have nachos, fries, street corn and even a whole line of fresh fruit drinks. The way the tacos are done is a little different though. If you want a standard street style taco, you'll want to order what they call the \"Mini Taco\". What they advertise as just a \"Taco\" is basically a fully loaded taco with your choice of meat. All the pricing is very fair and for 5 of us, the bill was just over $40.

I ended up ordering 3 different tacos to try, one each of the shrimp, al pastor and carne asada. The tacos are loaded pretty good with toppings and they aren't skimpy with the meat which is always a huge plus. Tortillas were decent and I like that they give them like just a light touch on the grill. Out of the 3, my favorite was the shrimp. Each shrimp was plump and cooked very well. However, the al pastor was a little lacking in flavor and although the carne asada tasted good, it was super dry. They do have a couple sauces at the table that helped and while pretty tasty, they were way too spicy for my 5 year old. We also got a couples orders of chips and quac. Their quac was thick and fresh but the chips come in a pretty small order and were super salty. 

The service was ok but they definitely have some kinks to work out. I noticed a few others mention the same thing but our food came out in such weird intervals. Our food came out first, then chips, then the quac for the chips and then when we were almost done eating, the corn came. Just strange. It also seemed like the owner was working harder than anyone else. While I think it's necessary for an owner to work in their business and I appreciate it, I don't see why he's sweating and running around while employees are standing behind the counter doing nothing. 

All-in-all, this is a solid little joint and I think with time and minor changes, they will do really well. Nothing stood out as outstanding but it was decent and I would come back when in the area."}
{"text":"I stopped by on the way home from an event.  I got a Carne Asada Burrito, Carne Asada Quesadilla and a couple of Carne Asada mini tacos.  As I waited for my to go order noticed how nice the interior is.  Really nice place.  The service was super friendly and the lady behind the counter gave me a couple of coupons for a free Fresca for my next visit - sweet! 
   The Carne Asada is cooked on a BBQ grill and has such great flavor.  That was the first thing that makes them stand out from the many other Mexican places.  The second thing is they use quality ingredients which made all 3 items selected so tasty.  Add in the read or green salsa and it definitely satisfied my carving for good Mexican food.  The salsas were really tasty and had a unique flavor that we all enjoyed.
   Their prices are very good and comparable to their competitions prices.  Their BBQ flavored Carne Asada is awesome.  That BBQ flavor added to good Mexican food is what is going to bring me back again.  I am so looking forward to my next visit!  Next time going to try their Fresca's too.  Great stop on your way home from the strip."}
{"text":"This small, casual place is very clean and organized. You order at the front counter, seat yourself, and bus your table when you're done. I ordered the grilled chicken quesadilla. The tortilla was soft with slightly crispy edges. The chicken, which had a strong  charbroiled taste, was mixed into avocado and sour cream, making a soft and moist filling. I quite liked it! The chips were average, but good. And the guacamole was fresh and not overly spicy. Since it's close to CSN, I'll definitely come back between classes for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"AHHHHHHHHH!!! I AM SO HAPPY!! 

I literally used to have to drive for 20 min. to get to the location on Charleston but now they opened one more south which is super convenient for me since I could just go straight down Tropicana road on the way to work if I am craving some mexican food!!

The outer appearance for this location seems to be a LOT more inviting though ahhaha. The interior is also clean just like the other location. They have a counter top where you could sit & enjoy your food while they make the food. Once thing I liked about the other location was being able to see EVERYTHING without having to TRY to look over a counter. 

Service is great for this location as well greeting you with a smile & the guy that was making my food even bothered to have a conversation with me while I was sitting watching my food being made.

Food was delicious as I got my usual selections. I was a LITTLE disappointed with my CARNE ASADA BURRITO - it literally seemed like there was only meat in it... usually there would be a good amount of guacamole. pico de gayo. & cheese but it lacked these things which made it seem a little Bland. 

CARNE ASADA FRIES - delicious & served with FAT fries. Each bite had a little bit of everything when mixed which in my opinion is to be considered a good Carne Asada fries.

MEXICAN STREET CORN - packed with cheese & sprinkled chili powder

Overall I crave it & if you can make me crave something it is well worth 5 stars from me! Plus their AGUA FRESCA selections are PERFECT for the HOT HOT summer days coming our way here in Vegas! =]"}
{"text":"MIX & MATCH FRESCAS

We went here for a late lunch & it was awsomee!!!
We got street corn which could have used more cheese but they gave us more on the side

The cashier was super nice & gave us samples of every aqua frescos
We got a mixture of drinks along with a huge burrito and juicy Carne asada fries w/ fat zigzag fries and a street steak taco.

We also got mexican ice cream pops and $1 refill on our drinks!!"}
{"text":"Always clean and pretty casual when I've attended. The food is fresh and delicious. I consider this the more authentic version of a Cafe Rio with fresh waters (Aguas). I wish I could pre-order and pick up food via an app!"}
{"text":"We're from SF, CA. 
After a tiresome work out @ 24hr Fitness down the road we were feeling weak & sick. Yelp brought up list of Taqueria's. Frijoles was #1 based on ratings. Just a 3 min. drive and we there. 
I ordered a vegetarian tostada, crispy steak taco and nachos. ALL if the dishes were good. Our drinks were perfect as well, not too sweet, sour or watered down. We'll definitely return here. 
It's bright and clean inside which means a lot to us. If you would prefer your food on the juicy side ask for more salsa fresca with its juice. ENJOY It!!"}
{"text":"Food is good I ordered the asada nachos to go and I received a good portion with all the toppings. Very delicious. I like that they do takeout."}
{"text":"Great service, tasty food, will definitely come back again. The frescas were so good and refreshing."}
{"text":"Soooo delicious! I love all of their food I have ever ordered and don't mind driving 10 minutes on my lunch break to get there. I crave it. So much better than other Mexican fast food places."}
{"text":"Great customer service and the food was amazing!!!!  I had a shrimp quesadilla so good. The horchata is to die for!!!!"}
{"text":"It's a better Roberts. Went here the other night. 930pm on s Friday so I'm sure everything had been sitting out so I can't say it was fresh. Either way I watched as 2 people brought their food back on mistakes. My food came out hot and the way I ordered it. They do have Mexican corn if you like that. The favors of juice is very nice. Loved the mini tacos. Not so much on the burrito. Coulda just been the last of the chicken but the mini tacos were great."}
{"text":"We live right around the corner and I kept seeing all the great reviews so we had to stop in. I am really glad we did, I was pleasantly surprised! I order the fish burrito meal and my husband got lengue, cabeza, al pastor and carne asada tacos and WOW they were amazing! Of course I had to try a little piece of all the tacos he had, al pastor was the best I've ever tasted. The lady behind the counter let us try samples of all the aguas frescas and I think the cucumber is my favorite so far! The decor is nice, restaurant was clean and food was quick and WOW WOW WOW. Another reviewer said it has a fast food type feel, which I understand because you order and they bring it to you, but it is way better than anything you will ever have fast food wise. Definitely recommend anytime they're open, can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I expected to get large portions for the price . The flavor is ok, but portions are definitely not worth what they charge. Part of my order es a shrimp quesadilla and it only had 4 shrimp in it. The kids quesadilla was 2 bites. No better place in Las Vegas for tacos than Tacos El Gordo"}
{"text":"I love love love love LOVE this place! 

Fresh food, reasonable prices, excellent staff and super clean family-friendly facilities with an authentic menu... what more could you want? 

And the owners are awesome! 

I've tried one of everything, even the \"exotic\" choices, and there is not a single disappointment on the menu. Sometimes I'm just in the mood for beans and rice, and even that simple dish leaves me feeling happy.

This is a family owned restaurant with three locations as of this writing. And I expect some day, they will be everywhere!

Here's the kicker. They are closed on Sundays and limited hours on many holidays because they care about their employees' families! Isn't that fantastic!

Need your event catered? This place will take care of you!"}
{"text":"Our family looks forward to a time here. The food is always spot on. The service is great and the restaurant is clean."}
{"text":"Just came here for my first time and it won't be the last. The woman at the register was very excited to tell me about the different options (tacos, burritos, quesadillas, etc) and the different meats they prepare. She even served me at least 3 samples of different aguas frescas that they have as well.

In the end I went with a regular taco with pork al pastor. Rice and beans came on the side and I also upgraded my drink to an agua fresca trifecta of a strawberry, mango, and horchata mix. Very good! I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Awesome service!!! I love street corn and their burrito is way better then Roberto's burritos. It's not so much but enough in the tortilla."}
{"text":"Awesome food and frescas! Family & I come here at least once a week, more if it was closer to home. We have had most of the items on the menu, my husbands favorites are al pastor tostada, tacos and elote (corn). I stick with the veggie tacos and rice and beans. Food is fresh & delicious every time! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"mannnnnnnnnn this place is soooo good!!!!!!  Roasted corn!!  Tacos so bomb!!  Aqua Fresca, you can get a sample before you choose what juice blend you want!!  The guac is super chunky, and the prices are great"}
{"text":"Food is ok. The meat in the tacos (carne asada, pork, and chicken) lack seasoning. They seem cooked and not made fresh to order. The same applies for the tortilla. It's not home made.  The corn  was ok.  Nothing to scream about and say \"wow\".
I guess if you went to Tacos El Gordo, it's hard to compare it."}
{"text":"they are not too bad...
they for sure know mexican food. but what im not liking is the prices on tacos! 
their hot sauces are amazing.... but untill i see a price change i wont be back, i rather go sit in a restaurant for just $2 more."}
{"text":"Ive been meaning to try Frijoles for a while, so my husband and I headed over there tonight even though it's a bit of a hike from our 'hood. I tried the taco meal with al pastor meat and the Mexican street corn, while my husband did a quesadilla and nachos, both with carne asada. My taco was great, the rice was tasty and cooked well, and the street corn was awesome! We lived in Idaho for a year and I frequented the BEST elote truck ever and I've been searching for a place in Vegas to fill that void-Frijoles has got me covered! The food was super fresh. I think next time I'd go for two tacos, because I skipped the beans (I know, basically blasphemy when the restaurant is literally named for the beans, but I'm just not a fan) so I was hungry a few short hours later. 
I took a bite of my husband's quesadilla and it was good-but I wasn't able to snag a bite of nachos because he devoured them, so they must have been good as well. I didn't try any of the beverages, but I'd definitely like to next time. You order at the counter and your food is brought to you. However, we bussed our own table because we weren't really sure what the protocol was for that. I also really don't mind cleaning up after myself so it's no biggie. Service and food were great-we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food with the grease. This place is so healthy. Everything is made fresh to order. Nothing microwaved. The staff is friendly and the place is super clean."}
{"text":"Pretty good tacos but a tad pricy,  have gotten a different kind of beverage every time and all have been terrific"}
{"text":"The tacos were so good! So much flavor! I had the carne asada taco and tried my husband's al pastor taco, both were amazing. Not too greasy, and one big taco was very filling. I also thoroughly enjoyed my strawberry mango agua fresca! This place is great. Can't wait to try more items from the menu next time!"}
{"text":"Good food. Very reasonable priced. The staff is very friendly. And I really enjoy that they sell the flavored fruit drinks very well. They give you samples of the different flavors and mix em all up for you. The food is good also. Overall not bad. My wife and I are checking in every other month. Good stuff."}
{"text":"OH EM GHEEEEE!!! this place has the best, fresh, salsa!! I could stay here all day and eat it. We got the platter, 2 mini tacos (that we're stuffed with meat) the shrimp ceviche and the watermelon Fresca. Everything we had was Devine."}
{"text":"Clean place with restrooms and plenty parking. About 20 tables with additional bar seating .
Great food! 
Only one negative . When you order a combo it comes with a drink. They will then ask you if you want a fountain drink (sodas) or if you want Agua Fresca ( flavored waters such as watermelon , cucumber etc .)
What they won't tell you is when you say u want the agua Fresca they will add .75 cents (medium) without letting you know first . Fine. I would gladly pay the upgrade for the Agua Fresca , but they should inform you first .
Price for the Medium Agua Fresca by itself btw is $2.50
So back to the positive:
I ordered the taco combo for $7.99
Which came with one Taco , rice and beans and  a fountain drink . As mentioned already I went with the Cucumber Agua Fresca for the additional .75 cents.
I also ordered a side of chips and guacamole for $3.00 .
Chips and salsa are available for $2.00
And finally how could I resist the grilled street corn also known as elote .
So the Taco (Asada or Steak ) was perfect . Not greasy at all.
Chips and guacamole were adequate . The guacamole was not spicy , and that's fine because that's the way I like it .
The elote was excellent ! It was grilled instead of boiled or steamed as you will find in other places . 
I love this place and will return but probly not pig out as much as I did this time. I think I over did it ."}
{"text":"My husband and I were there on 8/29 for the first time and we really enjoyed everything we ordered. We ordered three tongue tacos, omg all meat and super good! We also ordered the al pastor taco and the meat was on point with the flavors of al pastor. Carnitas is my fave so we had to order some, and they are the best carnitas I've had on this side of town, I was so happy they were awesome! They also have green and red salsa on every table not super spicy but very good and authentic. The street corn was good too. My only complaint is that I thought it was bit pricy for Mexican food, but everything we ordered was super good and worth the price. Oh I can't forget to mention, they have Aguas frescas I tried them all and they were all so refreshing and delish! Try the spinach agua fresca it was so good. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I love this Mexican Restaurant. The food is prepared so well.  I normally don't eat that much steak, but when I go there I must have anything with carne asada. I've had carne asada burrito, carne asada quesadilla, carne asada nachos, carne asada fries, carne asada tacos. I've been there so many times, I've pretty much tried everything and it's always been a great food experience. Staff is always friendly too. Their aguas frescas are also de super delicious. I like to mix cucumber and chia agua fresca, so refreshing during summer time.!"}
{"text":"There is nothing special about their food. For 5 stars there needs to be something different. The food is very good. Along with the service. There was a lot of fat on my steak but i will be back. A nice place to sit and eat a little bit."}
{"text":"Love this place, my go to fast Mexican food place. Everything I've tried there has been delicious."}
{"text":"This place has fresh food and perfect portion sizes.

But their chips and guac ratio needs some attention."}
{"text":"This place is like a fancier version of Roberto's. I ordered the carne asada fries, and at first they looked small, but I was definitely full after I ate them. The service was great, especially for the type of place that it is. They forgot to put the avocado that I asked for, and the lady was not at all bothered when I asked her about it, she was actually quite nice about it, which I appreciated. I hate when employees make it seem like it's your fault if they forget something. Overall, it's a great place to drop in for lunch."}
{"text":"Always a good spot for fresh Mexican food and deliciously refreshing juices. The burritos are very good and you can't go wrong with it since it's so fresh and tasty.
You can order all your favorite tacos and the fish tostada is a MUST each time I visit, so light and amazingly prepared. The fish tostada is $3.99 each, but worth every penny!
The menu board is on the left wall and you pick your items and order from the girl behind the counter. They give you a number and bring your food out to your table.
The restaurant is on the northwest corner of Tropicana and Rainbow with lots of parking in front. This is kind of a fast food, sit down place or you can take food to go.
Nothing fancy, but it is clean and the food is very good. Don't forget to order a large Agua Fresca with your meal, I like them all, but really like the watermelon or the lime cucumber.
The only bad thing is they are a located a long distance from Henderson, but it's worth the drive and also they are closed all day on Sunday. Check them out for lunch or dinner, it's good!"}
{"text":"Good Mexican fast food. They have well seasoned tender meats that make the meal. Good large portioned burritos, freshly made corn chips and salsa, awesome fresh fruit drinks and a delicious chia seed and cucumber water. I was surprised to see street corn, not too impressed, but I still ate it since it's rare to see street corn in a restaurant or in Vegas for that matter. Its no Los Angeles street corn, but it was nostalgic for sure. Friendly staff, clean dining area, clean restroom, fair prices. I will be back for some al pastor tacos and agua fresca de sandia."}
{"text":"Delicious! I love authentic Mexican food! Great food and great prices! Owner was there and greeting patrons and was very friendly! I will definitely be back and with my kids!"}
{"text":"Had nachos that were good, they are generous with toppings. Had a few tacos asada and fish. The fish was great!! Spicy sauces offered not spicy :( Mexican corn my son ate all off must have been good! Rice and beans a-ok! Overall good experience!"}
{"text":"Really good Mexican food! I love anything Al Pastor there. Love their Aguas frescas too! We always go to Frijoles when in a hurry because they are fast!! Really good service too!"}
{"text":"SUPER pleased with this place. I was with a friend who recommended eating here. From the outside, I would never think to stop in. I'm so glad we did! The quality and freshness was inherently present. I had a carne asada quesadilla. While it lacked a bit in cheese for a quesadilla, it made up with loaded meat and guacamole. So many places charge extra for guac, but not this place! I can't wait to go back and try more menu items!"}
{"text":"Yelp reviews led us here. Upon walking in I wasn't impressed with the decor of the restaurant. I have no problem overlooking that because I'm (most likely) not eating the decor.  I decided on the Mexican street corn and a carnitas taco for dine in. I paid at the counter and was given a number to display on my table so the order could be brought to me. After a few minutes a woman delivered my order. She forgot to bring my drink. I explained that when she dropped the food off. She said she would be right back with it. After 5 minutes of watching her take an order from a new customer that walked in,  clean a counter,  and walk to the back I decided to go ask at the counter instead. She seemed genuinely apologetic and I was able to start my meal. The taco was huge and tasty but nothing memorable.  The grilled corn was delicious and juicy with just the right amount of heat. Based on the corn alone I will be visiting this place again."}
{"text":"I love trying new taco places and this one has to be one of my favorites including with Taco Y Taco. 
My visit was quick but it was good giving me a lasting impression. Ordered a strawberry mango fresco with three mini tacos of al pastor, cabeza and lengua which I abosolutely love. And just with three mini tacos , I'm already full. The flavors were amazing unless I haven't had tacos in a while but there salsa verde had a really good kick to it too. The texture of the lengua and cabeza were and always will be my favorite. Definitely recommended. The place is quaint it's in the corner of Antelope and Charleston so super convenient if you go to school as the West Charleston campus of College of Southern Nevada. Though I am upset that they're not open late enough but much respected because I wouldn't want to work past 9p or 10p either . The only thing I haven't seen it busy so I can't give any tips for their rush hour but I did enjoy the space they had on a slow time after class. Again, check them out! I look forward in trying the rest of their menu and drink options !"}
{"text":"El pastor taco and a watermelon drink are my absolute favorite. This is my favorite taco place!"}
{"text":"From the looks of it, this place occupies an old Pizza Hut. The inside however, is nicely decorated with with plenty of wood and metal (somewhat similar to Chipotle's industrial style) along with Mexican artifacts to give it a distinctly non-pizza vibe.

It's a fast causal, order-at-the-counter spot with friendly service. The carnitas tacos -- filled with tender, moist, and crispy-edged chunks of meat -- were the best items I tried. The al pastor lacked the depth and heat of greater versions around town. The carne asada was solid --  quality meat that was under seasoned but still decent. There are several flavors of agua frescas available with the option of mixing them together. The strawberry mango flavor was so good it was gone before the food hit the table.

3.5 Stars"}
{"text":"I wanted to try a new place for dinner and am glad we found this one. Here It's worth it for just the drinks alone! This place used to be a Pizza Hut, but once you step inside you forget about all of that. Inside was very clean and they offer plenty of seating. You walk up to the counter to place your order and then they give you a number to place on your table. When your food is ready it is brought out to you. Our food didn't all come at the same time which seemed odd. The girl who took the order was very nice and offered me samples of their freshly made drinks. 

Watermelon Agua Fresca ($2.50) - Very tasty and refreshing. I couldn't put it down! They have many other flavors just ask for a sample to see which you'd like. 

Mini Taco Al Pastor ($2) - This has onions cilantro, salsa and a fair amount of meat. I thought the tortilla tasted good and the taco was decent. Not as good as some of the street vendors I have been to, but decent for the price and nice flavor. They also have tacos similar to \"Los Tacos' that are $4.50 each, but come with sour cream, rice, rice, beans, cheese, salsa and avocado.

Rice and Beans ($2) - Sadly, they were out of rice. I said that it was ok and I'd just try the beans. They apologized and gave us an extra side of beans instead. I was hoping with a place called Frijoles, that they would have amazing beans. I just thought they were ok. They weren't bad. Just nothing wow and could have used more seasoning or something.

Chips and Guacamole ($3) - I love that they use fresh avocados here! The guac tasted great, but could have used a bit more salt. The chips were very good.

Cheese Quesadilla ($2.50) - Simple yet tasty from the first bite. The tortilla tasted good and it wasn't loaded with cheese, but what was there could be tasted and it was good. Simple can be very good sometimes! 

I'm glad we tried this place and look forward to coming back and trying more. The only downside, they have no salsa bar. They need a salsa bar!"}
{"text":"Patricia greeted me was rude and it seemed since I didn't leave a tip I am still waiting for my food. Over 5 minutes and there is no one here. I'm glad I didn't leave a tip"}
{"text":"HEY! This place is pretty DAMN good!! Very pleasantly surprised! I'm gonna go back and do some more in depth research and do a proper review! In the meantime, try the elote aka Mexican style corn on the cob!!"}
{"text":"Worth your while. My whole family loves dining here. I ate lunch here and I want to come back for dinner! It's that good!"}
{"text":"I was in the area, and wanted to check out something other, than the regular places I go.  So I used my fabulous yelp app.  And found this place.  I go in to check it out.  As I'm looking at the menu, the girl that takes my order stands there.  I told her I wasn't ready yet.  She still stood there.  I took at least 5 min.  So I decided to go with a salad, with the Carne Estada.  But as I looked around, I see they don't have a Salsa bar!  Whoaaaa, are you serious, no Salsa, no Jalapenos/Seranos.....Ok, would have given 5 stars.  So my salad came, and it looked yummy, and it was!  I just wish I had some Jalapenos/Seranos, and Salsa!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and a lot of it.  We were stuffed before we could finish all of our food.  Staff was extremely helpful and assisted us in matching our dinners with sides.  The Mexican Coke was so fantastic.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Grabbed lunch here yesterday and the food was pretty bland as I doused my tacos in more sauce and salt than I should as the meat was pretty flavorless. I ordered a two taco plate, chips and guacamole along with some salsa. I also ordered a horchata and churro. I had to add salt to the salsa and the guac as well. Why?? The churro and horchata were delicious though! I enjoyed both!"}
{"text":"I moved to Vegas from Cali so i am always looking for a good place for Mexican food.. and i can truly say this place is delicious!! Reminds me of California restaurants.. i went with my boyfriend and then convinced my entire family to go, then took my friends, and everyone i have taken has said they cannot wait to go back. THEIR AQUAS FRESCAS are the best! you need to get one of their unique aqua fresca combos, its so fresh!"}
{"text":"This is one of your cleaner, friendlier taquerias in town, but the food overall didn't really impress me much. To tell you the truth, even some of the street taco vendors in the sketchy parts of town put out better tasting tacos. I ain't lyin'...

We shared an assortment of tacos-Asada, Pescado, Lengua, Cabeza, Al Pastor, Beans and Rice, Mini Quesadilla and Spinach Agua Frescas. The Quesadilla wasn't all that, and of all of the other tacos, none of them weren't bad, but not bomb.com either. Elote was just meh, but my agua fresca was refreshing. It was pretty chilly, so Wifey got a Chocolate Champurrado to go.

For me, not my favorite taqueria, call me loco, but I tend to lean toiwards the more hole-in -the-wall/street vendor type places, because that's where I've found much more flavorful Mexican food with a lot more soul for sure. ALOHA!!!

{"text":"Love this place! We eat here once a week. Love the burritos, quesadillas, rice, chips and salsa. Everything I've tried I love. My family enjoys it and they aren't big on Mexican food. I love that everything has whole pinto beans instead of refried! Everything always is so fresh. Yummy!"}

{"text":"The nachos were pretty good especially with the carne asada. The ceviche was just ok to me, but not a deal breaker since it was only $4.99. The sweet corn was to die for and the watermelon agua fresca was amazing. I can't wait to try the other flavors. I will definitely be back to try other items on their menu. Very good Mexican food and the staff is nice."}

So I'm still getting to know everything, an I am so happy I found this place 
It's authentic Mexican food with a twist 
I had the \"Taco\" is huge an filled with goodness 
My wife had the quesadilla and nachos they were amazing too.
They have vegetarian options which is even better.
And last the Agua Fresca is to die for.
I will most definitely be back."}
{"text":"Just ate lunch here today and my husband and I were really blown away! I got a carne Asada taco and a carne Asada mini taco and the husband got two al pastor tacos. Just FYI the \"mini tacos\" are not mini, they're standard size street tacos and the \"tacos\" are huge and loaded with all the fixin's; whole seasoned pinto beans, tomatoes, guacamole, sour cream, etc. So good!!! I tried my husbands al pastor meat and it was addictively good! Sweet and rich in flavor. We also ordered aqua frescos (I think that's what they're called, the fruit juice drinks) and I've never had anything more refreshing! The manager Greg let me get two flavors so I had pineapple and mango! Amaaaaaazing!! Everyone was very friendly too. The manager even walked to our table and took the time to talk with us and was so kind and welcoming. Very incredible service, has a very family feel to it. Definitely plan to come back whenever I'm in Vegas and try their nachos, fries and maybe a burrito too and recommend you try this place."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite Mexican restaurants! They have the best shrimp cocktails! They have the large for about $15 and it is massive! It's worth it! The shrimp cocktail comes with chips and saltine crackers with a lime! The burrito is so amazing! It's so delicious! The staff were really amazing and patient and caring and sweet! Their service was pretty fast! My sisters and I were in and out of there in less than an hour. It's clean and it's a really chill place to have lunch and dinner regularly"}
{"text":"Bomb! Clean, excellent, authentic mexican food. No skimping on meat! The sandia agua fresca was delish. My shrimp quesadilla was superb! Mini tacos were tijuana street style. Even have lengua! Definitely coming back here! My friend said \"best mexican food in vegas\" and i completely agree! Not to mention amazing prices!"}
{"text":"So happy that I found this place on Yelp. We were a little apprehensive at first, however the parking lot was packed. 
I had the asada burrito with a strawberry fresca. It was so good. The green salsa was to die for! It was the best that I have had.
My hubby had the chicken quesadilla, with fries. He enjoyed his meal as well.
The bathrooms were very clean, and well kept. 
We will definitely be going back here."}
{"text":"very fresh ingredients, great flavors, the juice drinks are amazing.  the wife and I love coming here, and we go often.  it's a bit pricey for what they offer, hence why I give them 4 out of 5 stars."}
{"text":"Stopped here with my husband while doing a little shopping in L.V. and Omg, the tacos are fire! Great flavor, everything was super fresh. The beans and rice are bland in my opinion, but I could seriously eat a plate of tacos with their spicy flavorful chile and wash it down with a fresca and be in food heaven. We will definitely come back again. If you are looking for a great taco joint, check this place out."}
{"text":"Very good atmosphere and food, My favorite mini tacos and mexican corn so far this place is my favorite for Mexican food"}
{"text":"I guess I would try something different thn my usual spot, place is clean but ithe food seemed to be trying to do what Los Tacos are doing...but nowhere close to it..."}
{"text":"I love this place! The first thing I had was the fruit water, which I believe is a lot better than grabbing a fruit smoothie. All the food is fresh and made to order! Prices are decent nothing too cheap but you're getting quality in every meal. The customer service is great, they even remember your order. One of the best Mexican food restaurants in Vegas for sure!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in town! The fruit water is better than any smoothie and evrything on the food menu is BOMB! Honestly everything is ! Love the al pastor tacos"}
{"text":"So damn good!! Don't listen to the five or six two star reviews. They have no tastebuds. For he price you get a ton of food. The taco is amazing and the street corn is to die for. New favorite Mexican spot in Vegas. You're hungry, get here now before the lunch rush!"}
{"text":"Great tasting food and their frescas were soo good. I only order chicken tacos so I didn't try the other meats but the chicken had a great flavor."}
{"text":"Everything is so fresh & tasty. Love it! The Al Pastor, carnitas, & carne asada are so tasty. The corn is great too. Seriously everything I've had tastes fantastic. Service is also great. I will definitely keep coming back here."}
{"text":"Very good, low price and GREAT Aqua Frecas!!!"}
{"text":"OK how this place has been open and has almost five complete stars on here and I have never been before until now blows my mind this place is everything! My husband and I came here last week and I've been three times since. This place has the best rice and beans I have tasted in the entire Las Vegas area. Mexican food is my thing is my favorite type of meal to eat so I've been to lots of Mexican restaurants but honestly these rice and beans are packed with flavor. They've got these many quesadillas that are so tasty, And their mini tacos are so delicious, I love the fact that it's a small restaurant and  they have two locations so definitely check out both. I would say the only downside is they don't have alcohol which I think if they had some beer that would be an extra star! Service is great people are super friendly you just walk up you place your order and it's very quick and fast! I will say it does get super busy during lunch time so be prepared to stand in line but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Great fast and fresh mexican food! Not greasy made to order and good menu selection. Our new go to fast food mexican restaurant for sure."}
{"text":"Had the Cabeza mini tacos combo with with fresh strawberry juice.  2 thumbs up.  I was in San Fran and had Cabeza there...liked it better there, however, this is quality Mexican food.  Beans and rice were spot on too and salsas at each table were tasty with good spice too.

Service good, cleanliness good."}
{"text":"Very good and fresh tasting food. Only issue is that it is a bit on the expensive side for what you get. Have eaten their twice so far, and not really impressed. May or may not return,"}
{"text":"Love this place! My favorite proteins are the Al  Pastor and the Pollo. I usually love carne asada but I'm just not a fan of theirs. I love their elotes(Mexican street corn). The salsa that are on the table are yummmmyyy, especially the green one!!! 
Have to admit I have tried the Frescas but I'm sure they are delicious."}
{"text":"At this location, I've ordered their ceviche tostada and agua fresca and everything, including their customer service, was on point. Don't forget to order the street corn!"}
{"text":"I've visited both this location and the one on Rainbow and was never disappointed. Their burritos are good, their chips are extra crunchy (if that matters to you!) and their street corn is delicious. The food always comes out in under 15 minutes and the agua frescas are light and refreshing."}
{"text":"Yum yum Yum!  Tostada, tacos, fresca, shrimp cocktail all Good!  Very friendly staff!!!  Want good Mexican food come eat here.  You won't be disappointed!  We ate so fast that I have no pics.  Sorry!"}
{"text":"Trip to Vegas checking out spots off the strip and found Frijoles. Amazeballs! Hands down the absolute best Shrimp quesadilla I have ever had. Great size shrimp, delicious and mouthwatering. No doubt it would be great in a taco or burrito. Perfect carnitas, just a little crispy and moist at the same time, great flavor. 
 I love the variety of aguas frescas, I chose watermelon with pineapple added to it. 

Definitely coming back, wish one was closer! 

Would love to have seen a condiments bar with lime, salsas, onions/cilantro and maybe some radishes!"}
{"text":"We have tried so many Mexican restaurants in town, but I have yet to find one better than here. It's authentic and clean...which you don't always get both at most Mexican restaurants! The food is amazing and actually tastes fresh. And I get a juice every time I go. They're always friendly and quick. I was behind 3 young girls in line who were sampling everything and taking a long time. The young lady cashier grabbed another young lady to help me so I didn't have to wait. I was having trouble choosing a juice and she gave me recommendations and samples, even without me asking. I can't say enough good things about Frijoles and I would give them more stars if I could!"}
{"text":"This place is a great example of Mexican with American influence done right.

Since no one else has seemed to talk about the lengua tacos (because most of you guys may be too scared or too fond of your carne asada fries), I decided to let all my fellow lengua lovers know that this place has AMAZING lengua tacos and the now three times that I've had them they never disappoint. It's hard to find good tacos de lengua, but thankfully I live fairly close to Frijoles so I can my lengua fix with no problem.

The staff is friendly and seems to be made up of mostly Latino/a descent workers and that always gives me a sense of relief because you know they're not gonna give you a sad excuse for Mexican food like Chipotle or Roberto's.

Aguas frescas are just as good as you would get at Cardenas, maybe even better because you can taste how fresh it is!

The \"Mexican street corn\" I like, but it's not very authentic. They put their own twist on it by charring the corn and what tastes like lime juice on it? I'm not sure, but it's still pretty tasty. Just don't expect to get the kind you'd buy from the elote man on the actual street. :) 

Try this place guys, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Will definitely be going back soon. Al pastor and lengua tacos were really good. The meat was great quality. Aguas frescas are amazing especially strawberry mixed with horchata and the spinach one is so good and refreshing. They let you sample all of them. Street corn is also yummy. Next time I'll have to try the shrimp cocktail."}
{"text":"I remember coming here few months ago and was blown away by all the amazing tacos. I don't know if I came here on their off day or they went downhill but I was disappointed by my visit today.

SERVICE
Meh. Its one of those people that hates their job so they turn into a robot and don't give two shits about customers. Waited 15 min at the table for our order and lady threw the bag on the table and walked off. No thanks.

FOOD
On my previous visit, I ordered the mini Carne Asada taco and really liked it. I believe their mini tacos comes with cilantro, meat of choice and onions. They are only  $1.99 so it would be great for people who like to experiment with different add-ons and choice of meat. Carne Asada was so juicy few months ago. Now, its just a dry piece of meat. Asked for extra avocado but I barely got any which is somewhat irritating.

Fish taco was another one of my favorite from last visit. It used to have so much flavor. Now, lacks flavor and shredded fish that falls apart as crumbs everywhere. No thanks.

CONCLUSION
Please step up your game. You guys used to have some delicious tacos..I want them back!"}
{"text":"Every time I'm in Vegas I go to frijoles. Their al pastor tacos are what dreams are made of. The meat is so flavorful and rich. The veggies are fresh and in perfect quantity. They never skimp on guac or meat or cheese. Also the frescas a amazing!"}
{"text":"Love this place, great food and service. Had a large party here as well, and food came quickly, everyone was pleased!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing. The tacos are the best. If you like Mexican food you must eat here."}
{"text":"I love the drink but food is so-so... 
Service is good
If you don't know what to order they give you samples 
Lunchtime is very busy but after 3 pm was quite 
2nd time here to buy Mexican street corn and spinach drinks 
Corn was no flavor just mayo
Tacos was no source they didn't offer me or
Maybe I should asked ..."}
{"text":"It's amazing!!! Great customer service! And I love there waters !!!!!! I got the watermelon and cucumber water and it was delicious not to sweet , it was just right !"}
{"text":"I tried this place for lunch. Tate food was excellent. The beans rice and tacos were very tasty. The service was quick. Must eat"}
{"text":"This place has the best Mexican food and aqua Fresca in town. The prices are reasonable and the service is wonderful.  And if you are concerned about cleanliness, this is your place. I am now a regular. There is always plenty of parking."}
{"text":"I finally was able to check Frijoles & Frescas for lunch after many recommendations..I just became a fan!

Service:  Stopped in during the lunch rush with about 10 people ahead of us and we were ordering within 7 minutes.  I ordered a #3 Burrito combo which comes with chips, salsa and a fountain drink.  They brought the chips and salsa immediately to the table and the burrito followed about 5 minutes later.  Quick efficient service from the kitchen. Drinks are self service so the servers are focused on getting you your food from the kitchen and clearing tables to get people seated quickly.

Burrito time: When I come across tasty Mexican good it's always comes down to the ingredients and preparation.  Frijoles & Frescas might have the best casual Mexican for me right now.  This chicken burrito was very fresh, tasty and the perfect size.  Excellent

Frijoles and Frescas is currently winning the casual Mexican restaurant battle vs Cafe Rio in my book.  I'm not sure what they're doing in the kitchen but their food is coming out much tastier for the same price point.  If there was Frijoles & Frescas on my side of town, I'd frequent here more.  Enjoy...!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to get tacos! Everything is pretty delicious here but my favorite is the carne asada and carnitas tacos! They're always overflowing with deliciousness! Definitely a must go to for lunch!"}
{"text":"For a place named \"Frijoles\" you would think their beans would be good... the beans were so plan and were mediocre at best, not to mention their chips wear worse the beans."}
{"text":"Almost $4.50 for a taco? No thanks... 

Ill make this quick and dirty. The place is clean but nothing special in terms of service, location and dining room. The food although good, was nothing better than a Los Taco or Tacos El Gordo and with Gordo being $2 this place is really bleh to me at more than double. I had the \"street corn\" as well and i tasted more the crap thats on the corn than the corn itself. And it was not the crips, fresh tasting corn as if it was recently prepared it was closer to mushy like it been cooked previous and then warmed and served. 

I really just do not see why people are making such a big deal of the place, and  are being real let down by Yelp hype these days. Id say the best thing they have going for them is the Yelp hype and their presentation from the pics since thats what sold me on coming here."}
{"text":"Honestly I really LOVE the food here. I've tried a good portion of the menu and have never been disappointed and I love their fruit juices. While I love the food, that's only when they get my order right and don't forget my items which has been 3x now and they were all this week. (That's how good it is, I've been a ton) My latest order was through postmates in which a portion of my order wasn't there. I called the store in which they said they would call me back to resolve this matter yet they never did. And that to me is poor service and a reason I can't give them the 5 stars they should have."}
{"text":"Awesome food!  Fast, friendly and they have amazing, healthy drinks.  Way better than expected and worth the drive from the strip."}
{"text":"OK lets get it things straight. You don't need a whole novel to describe a mediocre taco shop. Positives: Meat is flavorful, corn on the cob is on pace to being good. (Its just corn prepared) I tasted better on a roadside in TJ and the staff really makes the place clean even during a busy lunch etc...I came twice just to make sure I didnt catch a bad day. 
Nope!
Negatives: Its a one trick pony! Staff is not what you call \"Hello!' Welcome! Why not? I cant stand the lady taking my order, there is so much to order. I mean what if I decided to try Lengua. If I try tongue, I just dont eat that anywhere. How is it prepared?! She is pushy and impatient...really? Street venders in TJ are more polite! The AGUAS FRESCAS are covered in Sugar probably to hide the quality of the \"fresh fruit\". Now the Taco: You dont need to but in every single ingredient in there, the meat and tortilla should do all the talking. This place has potential to be great, however looks like it is owned by an American with a passion for Mexican Cuisine and hired Mexican staff with no passion at all. If I'm going to spend 10 on burrito combo I expect at the VERY LEAST to be that experience."}
{"text":"This place is great!  Service was wonderful, food was great and it was very clean.  I get carne asada every where and theirs was very good.  It actually tasted like steak (unlike other places).  The beans are amazing!!!  We think it's slow cooked overnight because it has that consistency and amazing flavor!!!  The ladies are absolutely wonderful, they were accommodating and happy to have our business.   Its very busy during lunch and dinner which is a great thing...  We have come here 2 nights in a row when we discovered this gem of a place."}
{"text":"Been here several times, tried the carne Asada fries, Mexican street corn, pastor tacos and frescas.  Everything I've had here has been so good! I like the food here when I'm craving Mexican food and don't want anything to heavy or greasy.  I've ordered carne Asada fries at Robertos and other fast food restaurants in California which I love but I've always felt guilty and sad afterwards.  The Asada fries here (or pastor or shrimp or whatever meat you would like) are good but don't make you feel all crappy after finishing them.  The corn is great too!  I get usually get the Agua fresca with spinach and pineapple or strawberry with my meal which is super light and refreshing.  *lots of frescas to try, don't miss these!"}
{"text":"Amazing place! We are Mexicans and we are always trying to find good Mexican food which is not usual here but this place is a must. The small tacos, the carne asada platter, the street corn and OMG the Cabeza tacos are grrrrreat. I would just recommend hand made tortillas to turn this into a place to live Congratulations guys!!"}
{"text":"I mostly come for their frescas which are really good. I like doing the strawberry or pineapple with the horchata. Worth the drive when I have the craving!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a good to great Mexican place to eat. We happened to stumble upon Frijoles today for lunch  great food n drinks. Especially the Mexican street corn. Just like home in Diego!! If you get a chance stop by and try. We will definitely be coming back!!"}
{"text":"Wow! We are always looking for  good service and quality food and frijoles definitely has it. food was great! My new favorite!"}
{"text":"Anybody who is looking for a good real Mexican  food in the west part of town , this is the place to go. From tacos to shrimp cocktail, burritos and also the Aguas Frescas, no matter what to order,everything  is delicious......."}
{"text":"We found this restaurant on my first trip to Vegas because I was craving tacos. It did not disappoint. It's a casual and clean and the staff greeted us enthusiastically when we walked in. My husband and I both had the mini tacos. They were like those you'd find in Mexico City, where I lived for a time, and apparently the owner did d too. Their rice and beans were as good as my mother used to make growing up in Texas. I'd definitely come back here on my next visit."}
{"text":"when our food was brought to us, half our order was wrong. they weren't apologetic at all. I got the carne asada nachos and they were ok. the meat it self doesn't half a lot of flavor and a bit dry so you definitely need salsa. their aguas are probably the tastiest item! I got the mango and my sister got watermelon, amazing! I will probably not return due to their poor customer service skills and ok food."}
{"text":"My favorite place to stop for a taco. Quick, Quality food can't go wrong. The tacos are huge , one fills you for $5"}
{"text":"Clean, good service & food. Will stop again & recommend for everyone. Would like to see this place get the business it deserves :)"}
{"text":"Carne asada burrito with a strawberry/mango agua fresca is my go to, very good. Great prices also. Service can be slow and they have forgotten items a few times, but it does not stop me from eating there though."}
{"text":"Must try there strawberries, cucumbers, and pine Agua Fresca it's amazing. I also ate their burrito with asada, avacado, Pico de gallo, beans, and cheese it was super good and a good size burrito and really stuffed. Recommended!"}
{"text":"Now I want to preface my review with the fact that we are huge Arturo/Nancy fans. We came up from LA and we were not disappointed! The food,  prices and service is excellent!  It was a joy meeting and chatting with the store's propertor. I expect great things from this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Remember that YouTube video that went viral in December, where two idiots broke into a taco shop but the owner turned around and made the security footage into a funny commercial?
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzdv4FUHqP8...check it out, it's hilarious). 

Well, I finally got around to checking out the restaurant yesterday. The tacos shown at the end of the clip looked AMAZING, and I've been jonesing for them the entire month since I saw the video.

OMG!!!!! TRUTH IN ADVERTISING!!!! Everything I had was F A N T A S T I C ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !

I had a chicken taco, fully loaded -- sour cream, guac, pico etc with a soft-yet-semi-crunchy shell. I also had a shrimp mini-taco (just FABULOUS marinated shrimp, onions and cilantro) and a carne asada mini taco (asda, cilantro, onions -- also fan-fucking-tastically delicious). 

The flavors in the meat were amaaaazing, and the accoutrements were also tasty and fresh. Staff was friendly, service was fast, and the price was right. Restroom was super clean and smelled good; even the decor was on point. These people know what they're doing and we should all support them!

I can't say enough how much I loved this place, and not just because the owner apparently has a fantastic sense of humor -- the food is LEGIT! I will DEFINITELY be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Clean and fresh Mexican food. Great flavors all around. The tacos are a little more expensive but they are big and filled all the right stuff. Mexican street corn is great and all the drinks are refreshing. I would recommend the spinach one, healthy and surprisingly tasty."}
{"text":"The lengua mini tacos were delicious!  We loved the presentation of the shrimp cocktail.  It comes in a cute little beer mug served with a side of chips and crackers.  Taste wise -it was refreshing and slightly sweet.  The street corn wasn't what I am used to(it was grilled), but it was still good nonetheless.  The carne asada fries were a bit on the soggy side.  The agua frescas were SO GOOD!  My friend chose a watermelon/mango mix and I chose a strawberry/pineapple mix.  Overall experience was good.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  I learned what agua frescas was thanks to the friendly cashier up front :) lol.  The cooks were also very friendly!"}
{"text":"I first visited Frijoles a year ago. I'm an Arturo Trejo (YouTuber) fan, so I knew about the restaurant from afar. My fiancée and I made the trip to Vegas from Los Angeles and we weren't disappointed. We came back a second time that trip because we couldn't get enough of the food and friendly staff. On our most recent trip, we stopped by the new location as well as the first and it was just as we remembered. Back home, we frequently talk about how much we miss every one of their entrees, aguas frescas, and delicious sauces. Frijoles can't be beat!"}
{"text":"First time coming here with the family i am definitely comeing back its almost 30min from where i live  but worth it i tried carne asada quesadilla with watermelon drink and my husband tried the carne asada burrito with mango drink we will back soon"}
{"text":"This place is just ok...

I really wanted to love this place, being Mexican, it's hard to find good food here that's up to par with my own. The employees really stand out, they're sooo nice and accommodating. I've tried a lot of items on their menu, but all with carne asada so I can give my input on that at least.

Carne asada fries - crinkle fries topped with guac, sour cream, cheese, pico, and your choice of meat. What I would def do is not use crinkle fries! They are seriously the worst fry to use. Please use a normal French fry instead! Also, the sour cream they use is like a regular sour cream from what I tasted, instead I would opt for crema Mexicana, it'll definitely improve this dish x100! They are also kinda stingy with the carne asada, I'm paying 6.50$ for this plate, give me some more meat please! The guac here is fresh, but just doesn't hit the spot. There is not enough cilantro, jalapeno, or even garlic salt. It's super bland! The best carne asada fries are going to be from El Gordo.  5$ for half an order, but they come with double the fries, and do not skimp on the meat! 
Plain cheese quesadilla - It's pretty hard to mess up a quesadilla. LOL.
Mini tacos - For 2$ you get a corn tortilla with your choice of meat. Again we did CA, and during our second visit the meat in our nachos and tacos were luke warm so it kinda ruined the meal. I know 2$ doesn't seem much, but I think for the amount of meat given they should maybe lower it to 1.50 like all the other places who sell street tacos and have piping hot meat off the grill. Also, you have to ask for limes.
CA Nachos - I got these sans beans and pico. IDK why but I've never had nachos with beans. Again the meat was scarce and warm, guac was bland, but the chips were good. 6.50 for this plate also. 
Elote - 2$ for this deliciousity. I'm assuming it comes with butter, cheese, and powdered chile. I wanted to love this corn, but it was just ok. It needed something else. IDK if they do not use mayo, but it didn't taste like it. I also got a piece that was a little too charred and was a little cold.

The décor is super cute, alas some of the tables are awkward because they are from the old Pizza Hut. They're super large so if you are sitting across from each other it's a reach. I would replace those babies. 

This place has a ton of potential, we have gone 2wice, but I honestly make better food at my own home for a fraction of the cost. 

Like I said, they have awesome lovely employees, it's just some of the food was super bland.
Yay!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and every time I come, the food is delicious and fresh. The staff is friendly and their selection of aguas frescas is amazing. The food is just as appealing to the eye as it is to the taste buds. 

Not much else to say other than if all you're used to is Roberto's, take a step into the light and you will be pleasently surprised."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's best my house and my go to. Chicken nachos are incredible and a great value for the amount of food you're getting. You can also get them vegetarian. The mini tacos are your \"normal\" street tacos with cilantro and onion. The chicken tacos are bomb and have a nice char flavor, and the al pastor are also excellent. Subtle spice, enough for you to notice, but not too much. Their elote is good but it's hard to fuck up corn covered in cheese tbh. The aguas frescas are my favorite thing. You can mix and match how you want. Cucumber is fresh as hell but I normally sick to horchata and strawberry."}
{"text":"The Agua Fresca was good However the cashier/server was extremely rude ! Had an attitude, Right after we placed our order I asked if I could change my drink flavor because it wasn't the drink I'd seen on their picture . She got upset and told me well I already made it so i guess I am going to have to throw it away ! Trust me I could have just purchased another drink , I didn't need her nasty attitude or eye rolling Eveything from there was downhill 1st impression is everything. I decided to try this place because of the Good reviews on Yelp and pictures I'd seen. Food was mediocre- This is a Honest bad review !"}
{"text":"My husband and I randomly stopped in and we are SOO happy we did. They have only been open 1 year and they have done everything right, the service is amazing, the decor is very cool and rustic, everything was clean and the food was to die for. Nothing is greasy and they give you a lot for your buck. Every taco comes with guacamole and they don't charge extra for it like most places. They make fresh juices everyday...I believe they have strawberry, watermelon, mango, pineapple & spinach. I mixed spinach with pineapple & I will order it every time :D you have to try the Street Corn as well...it melts in your mouth and has the perfect amount of queso & Cheyenne"}
{"text":"Ordered take out on a hockey play off knight. We got a carne asada burrito meal, 3 al pastor tacos, and carne asada nachos. When I called my order in it was around 6 something and she said it would take 10-15 minutes for it be ready. I live aprox. 7 minutes from this place so I figured by the time I arrived with traffic I would be there and it would be getting packed up, I was wrong when I arrived it was hot ready and waiting for me. I was greeted warmly when I walked in. I was interested in their agua frescas and I couldn't make up my mind so the girls let me try the ones I wanted with a smile and they were still able to take care of their customers in line."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing and walking distance to my house. I love this place I have yet to try something I don't like."}
{"text":"Pretty good food but kind of run of the mill, didn't blow my mind. I'd eat here again, but wouldn't go out of my way to do so."}
{"text":"We've been going here a lot since they opened and never had a problem til now. I called to place an order for pick up and the girl who answered puts me on hold. When she picks up again, I told her I wanted to place an order for pick up and she sounded like she couldn't hear me so I repeat myself. After I repeated myself she takes a deep breath, sighs, and repeats herself in a rude manner. I'm pretty sure who it was because there's one girl that works there that doesn't even smile and polite to customers. So frijoles, you just lost a customer and hate to say it but I'd rather pay more for better quality food."}
{"text":"One of the very best mexican restaraunts in Vegas. I love this place. Great customer service. They go above and beyond to take care of the customers needs. You have to try this little piece of heaven. 5 stars and they earn it each time we visit."}
{"text":"For some reason I remembered the food being better when I came the first time. I remembered the fish and shrimp tacos being pretty good. So when craving fish tacos I thought going to Frijoles would satisfy my craving, NOPE.
The fish in the tacos was minced really fine, it looked mushy. It had a load of warm sour cream on top too. I don't mind sour cream but it being warm made me feel like it wasn't stored properly. 
The shrimp taco wasn't bad but nothing memorable. I also had the the el pastor mini taco which was not yummy at all. The pork was also minced super small and was hard. Like it was minced and laid out for a while. 
The pinapple fresca was pretty good though.
I don't know if I romanticized my last experience but this time around the tacos seemed different. I don't remember the fish being so mushy at all...
The service was good though. Ladies behind the counter are very nice and my tacos did not take long. Restaurant and bathroom are clean."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic, yhe food was a little pricey, but well worth it,  The lady behind the counter was super friendly, I would hire her in a minute. Service was fast and the place was spotless, I rarely eat out but I will go here often. 

Willie PSYCHO APPROVED."}
{"text":"The mini shrimp and mini al pastor tacos were the best! 
Great place for a quick dinner."}
{"text":"Best food ever!! Can never be compared with other mexican restaurants, their food is just authenti! Fresh food, their salads delicious and staff always friendly !!"}
{"text":"We were visiting from NY.  What a delicious find!!   Everything was fresh, delicious and inexpensive.   Nachos were sooooo good!   Delicious fresh fruit drinks too!  Friendly staff as well!!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't consider this place authentic by any means. I think it's much more \"Americanized.\" But that doesn't make it any less delicious. Frijoles & Frescas makes me wish a diet of meat, beans, & guac wasn't bad for you. 

Below are some things I've been able to try:
-Al pastor quesadilla- perfectly crispy yet soft tortilla folded over a whole load of delicious pork, melted cheese, guacamole, & pico. I like that they use real guacamole here. Pretty oily 
-Al pastor fries- good portion, tastes fresher than Roberto's because they're topped with a LOT of guac and pico de gallo and soft beans. Yum
-Tacos- kinda pricey for $5. You get all the toppings on these. I'd probably skip it cause you could get a burrito for a dollar more..
-Mini tacos- your regular street tacos with cilantro and onions and sour cream. I've had this with lengua which was cooked just right  
-Burritos- aren't as large as the ones at Roberto's, but definitely much more worth the price. More flavorful and sometimes dripping with oil
-Strawberry Horchata- a little on the sweet side for me

In short, I love that their pico de gallo and guacamole is not skimped on and is always fresh. It really livens up the already-flavorful meats. Al pastor is my go-to and is great. I'm not a fan of whole beans, but theirs is so soft (I'm a texture person). 
I just wish I had more self-control and didnt eat all of mine and my boyfriend's food every time I come here.."}
{"text":"Our first time here and we came back again two days later! I love their quesadillas and rice!! Their fruit drinks are perfectly sweetened. Also a good ambiance. Very clean."}
{"text":"I ordered a carne asada quesadilla..

-it tasted good
-portion size was above average/decent
-price at $5.50 isn't too bad

It did drip with butter/oil & there seemed to be a liberal amount on there

Girlfriend ordered the carne asada burrito meal. She said it was good.

It comes with chips/salsa & a drink.

Price is $10 for the meal.. so roughly $7-8 for the burrito.. $1 for the chips.. $1 for the drink.. I'd say it's a pretty good deal."}
{"text":"The girls that work there are a very rude ,catty and a bit racist . I've had food here before , but the second time I went I brought a friend and she ordered a Burrito she bites into the food and there is the biggest pepper in the center ... we both looked at the cooks and they were laughing saying things like \"she's mad \"speaking in Spanish and other little things .. I will never eat or recommend this place to anyone EVER !!!!"}
{"text":"I don't really write reviews but this place was great. I got there with a decent lunch rush of people and waiting in line went very quickly. I ordered the tacos al pastor and probably had the food out to me in under 10/15 minutes. The food was absolutely great, hot and fresh. The only thing that made the tacos better was the red hot sauce they had on the table. Also I am not a huge bean fan but their frijoles were really great. Anyone looking for nice lunch spot or a quick dinner; this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. Mind you I'm Mexican. It is a little more expensive I guess the Robertos or somethings like that but not by much better and it is well worth it! I got a carne Asada taco and carnitas tostada. The tostada tasted just like my moms. So good. And the carne a sad met is much better then Carne Asada you would get at your local taco shop. Omg the drinks! I got watermelon water. It was amazing. Me and my co workers all ordered food for their and ended up ordering seconds to go. We are literally food psychos. I'm coming back."}
{"text":"Love their street corn & quesadilla! The Fresca's are dynamite also -My fav is watermelon! The food may take a few minutes but only because it's made to order so it's fresh & yummy! Make sure you get in your craving before Saturday night too since they're closed on Sunday (which I crave it every Sunday like Murphy's law!) lol"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE SO MUUUUUUCH!!!! The prices are good and the quality of food and juices is top notch. Customer service is great and it's nice and clean. The ONLY negative thing I have to say about it is they're closed on Sundays which is so sad because it's my family day off. But I guess it's theirs too!!  I could eat here every day."}
{"text":"Want some good Mexican food? Come to Frijoles. Food is really good and really fresh. You can see from the dining room! I also love all the juices they make. I totally recommend getting a large watermelon juice (large = free refills!). The service is also very kind and friendly, one staff member told us where they got the recipe because we eat too much Frijoles. Also if your eating there it's not really loud and crowded. The tables are clean but just a heads up restrooms aren't really clean... I don't really care."}
{"text":"AMAZE BALLS!!!

Seriously, this place is amazing! Everything is made fresh and packed full of flavor! I've been going here since it opened and it's been consistently awesome!!!"}
{"text":"My to go place for fast Mexican food.  The staff is friendly, plenty of parking space and the food is delicious.  Try the shrimp burrito or taco and some agua fresca."}
{"text":"Ok gave it a second chance and yes it was way better....had the steak burrito and it was bomb :-) I'd eat here again"}
{"text":"Hands down freakin awesome for fast Mexican food =) frijoles has the home-cooking taste!  I would have to say; better than robertos"}
{"text":"I think Frijoles is Robertos fancier cousin. I do love Robertos but Frijoles has a wide assortment of fresh juices that you can mix together . I also like the fact that I can enjoy my food in a restaurant instead of sitting in a gas station.

I've come here on two occasions both times I did get the Elote (Mexican corn) . It has mayo, hot spices, crumpled cheese rolled on the outside.  It sounds weird but it is good! It isn't good for you though. I also  had a carne asada quesadilla which is steak meat, Pico De Gallo , cheese , guacamole in a tortilla. It was flavorful! 

I usually only trust Robertos with my carne asada fries but Frijoles does a great job! I was worried at first because they make theirs with thick fries. Since they drain the grease from the fries really well you don't end up with big grease drenched fries. The fries are cooked to a golden brown. Then the fries are topped with meat, cheese , pico de gallo, sour cream and guacamole.  It's a meal within itself! 

If you are craving Frijoles on a Sunday you are out of luck because they are closed. You can savor the taste for Monday."}
{"text":"I stopped in just before closing on a Monday night. Everything was really clean and the staff is super friendly.

They let us sample several of their agua fresca flavors. All of them were delicious, and I would go back just for the pineapple one!! They only have 1 size for $2.50. The watermelon and mango were great too!

Along with our 2 drinks, we ordered a carne asada quesadilla, a carnitas burrito, and Mexican street corn. Everything is made to order, and despite being the end of the night, tasted super fresh and homemade. I'm a Chipotle junkie, and I might like Frijoles better. The only thing I missed was the cilantro lime rice & the portions here are smaller. For everything we spent under $20.

The only thing I didn't care for was the street corn. I, unfairly, compare all street corn to Mundo's street corn which is off the charts amazing. And, while Frijoles is probably a more traditional version, it didn't blow mind like Mundo's did.

I would give this place an A overall, and I'm sure I will be a regular customer! They're worth checking out. The menu isn't huge, but what they have they do well and their prices are really affordable."}
{"text":"I came across their menu and read all the good reviews so I was excited to try the food and agua frescas! I had the shrimp cocktail and it was delicious! Also had a mix of watermelon and cucumber agua, also delicious. Highly recommend and will be going back to try more food and aguas!!!"}
{"text":"I stopped here yesterday got the pineapple fresca, carne asada mini taco and a carne asada burrito. The good was fresh, delicious and I loved the mini taco. Tonight's? Nachos and watermelon fresca"}
{"text":"The Carne Asada Salad is soooooooo good. Packed with lettuce, pinto beans, carne asada, avocado, tomato, and cheese. The cilantro dressing is delicious. I like to add a touch of hot sauce to mine and it is perfect!
The tacos are really good and the street corn was also quite tasty!
The menu is pretty extensive with choices of tacos, mini tacos, burritos, nachos, tostada, salads, quesadillas, and platters. 
Protein options are good too...... Carne Asada, Grilled Chicken, Carnitas, Al Pastor, Shrimp, Lengua, and Cabeza."}
{"text":"After reading reviews on frijoles, I was prepared to be let down, but I was not. The food was delicious and unique for a Mexican grill. I ordered for my family of six two plates of nachos, three full size tacos, a tostada, a dinner size salad, and some street corn. I chose a variety of meats offered including pollo, carnitas, carne asada and lengua. Everything was delicious, but to me the carnitas and the carne asada stood out as being the best. My kids are young but they ate and ate until they were stuffed full. Often it is a challenge to get them to eat, but they loved the food here as did the grownups. I really liked how they were liberal with the guac, cheeses, and pico de gallo. All of it was fresh and awesome. I really should have only had two tacos, but I ate three and sampled everything else I had ordered, but the food being great it was totally worth it being stuffed to the point of discomfort. I had to go on a long and vigorous walk afterward just to not feel like it was a post thanksgiving food coma coming on. The 16 oz. bottle of Mexican coke helped to fuel my journey. The staff let our kids sample the juices, and they raved how good it was. Well done, frijoles! 

Two minor improvements could be made. Ok, first it would have been great to have all of our food come out at once, but they did serve it to us literally hot off the grill, so maybe just do the whole order all at once instead of jumping from order to order. Second, it was bit pricey to make it a replacement for a weeknight dinner on a regular basis. We may have over-ordered, bit it was still about $20 more than dinner at Cafe Rio. That being said, it was delicious and I left really happy :-)"}
{"text":"The place was fast and staff friendly food not bad but the reason why I gave it 3 stars is because it's way overpriced for half the food you get a robertos with similar taste however the fresh fruit water was on point. I don't think I will be coming here again just because of the overpriced 5 bucks for one taco is too much for me."}
{"text":"I just had the al pastor salad, and it was both delish and aesthetically pleasing. I was pretty hungry, so I ate the whole thing before I could snap a photograph. Considering it was only about $7, I would say that this place is a very good value. It will definatly be my go to when I want quick-ish mexican food that isn't Taco Bell or Chipotle.

Update: I came here today, and unfortunately their credit card machine was down. I had cash, but I was a little short. They told me it was close enough. It's nice to see a company empower their employees to make those type of accommodations."}
{"text":"do you know how hard it is to find decent REAL street tacos? the kind you can get in Tijuana or mexico city?? this place does it for me. the street tacos are packed with meat and onions and cilantro. the burritos are huge and will make a mess of your shirt..but you won't care because you can't stop eating it. i'm the NORM of frijoles. i live in the NW..but you better believe id make this drive for some good tacos, elote, burritos and the aqua fresca drinks."}
{"text":"My go to place when I want my taco fix and Taco el Gordos is too far. Inside is clean. Price is decent. I prefer the mini tacos over the regular tacos but I need a few to be satisfied and full so the mini taco meal won't cut it for me lol. 

Recently the rice and beans portion is smaller. It's a small bowl instead of what is pictured. The mini tacos didn't come with lime this time.  They have two bottles of sauces on each table: spicy and mild and also hot sauce. Churros were a bit hard. Our tacos came before our rice and beans. They took awhile to give us the bowl of rice and beans and we were almost done with our tacos hence the 4 stars.

If you check in, you get a free fountain drink..if you just want mini tacos and save some money on a drink. 

I would definitely come again and recommend to my friends.  Still on the lookout for the best taco place but this does hit the spot."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Meat was tender we order the  Asada plater. Beans were delicious salsa was awesome! Staff was great and helpful and friendly!! My son eat the quesadilla and it was not greasy. Better than Pepes tacos."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place for Mexican food.  You can tell immediately that the ingredients are fresh and of the highest quality.  The recipes definitely have a more personal and traditional taste, than the cookie cutter offerings that you get from the chain stores like Chipotle and Qdoba.  There's also a really casual and friendly vibe that make you feel welcomed.  I'm a big proponent of supporting local businesses and when you have a place like this, that obviously cares about their product and especially about their clients, it's really easy to do.  This is my Friday night spot."}
{"text":"Totally not impressed.  Carnitas taco was very dry.  Fish taco was the worst I have ever had.  Tasted like canned tuna.  Just awful. Took 2 bites.  Waste of money.  Beans and rice (very good) and friendly staff and cleanliness were the only reason I give it even 2 stars."}
{"text":"Tried the Carne asada quesadilla and chicken burrito along with a pineapple juice. Place is a hidden gem in Vegas. The juices are really good and you get free refills. My friend took me here during EDC Week this year and I was really glad he did. It's like CA taco shops - family ran, good portions, prices and service."}
{"text":"Really really delicious. $2 mini tacos so you can try all the meats.   Very fresh tasting and clean environment.  

The carne asada French fries could use more meat, but it was still very delicious ! Which surprised me! (Huge meat eater)

Great prices for great food."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located at an old pizza hut restaurant. They have remodeled it and make it a bit more modern. However, they still left some of the red booths which are not the comfiest things. Either way, I could not stop comparing this place with Cafe Rio. I felt like they were trying to copy some of their dishes. For example the salad was delivered the same way as Cafe Rio. The food was good and perhaps a bit more typical. But I felt like the ingredients were lower in quality. For their \"Carne Asada/Steak\" they use flank steak which is one of the cheapest options. The dressing was good but you can tell they have watered it down. So for two dollars more you can get a huge salad at their competitors with a much higher quality. Overall, the food was good, and if i'm around I would like to come back and try their el pastor meat."}
{"text":"Very frustrated. We come in quite often and love the food. Today came in for nachos and there were about 12 chips with a little carne Asada and no cheese. When I went up to ask if they were right I was told they look like that because I asked for no beans. I paid $8 for nachos with no cheese and then had to pay another $3 to order chips with cheese so I could actually eat my nachos. Very disappointed and won't order nachos from here again."}
{"text":"This place was the bomb! Brought my family here for some mexican food. I had al pastor minis tacos, strawberry horchata & elote. I will just say it was delicious & even better for the price! This place is a cool little spot to get some good food at. I will definitely be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"The food tastes really good and fresh.  But the only thing that disappointed me was I ordered a shrimp taco (paid extra for) and they put just two small shrimp on it...."}
{"text":"Better than last time, but I'm not sure this place is for me. My palate seems to be in contention with their flavor profiles. The carne being grilled on my way out looked and smelled much better than the carne I got on my tacos. Maybe a cooked to order option could be a good one.   The place did get a little busy and I'm glad to see it. I wish these guys lots of success."}
{"text":"Delicious. When you walk in the smell is yummy the service good, and the restaurant clean. The carne asada burritos were delicious although I would have preferred a bit more meat. The salsas are fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"It's a great authentic Mexican restaurant for people of all kind. Tacos that are pretty big and stuffed with all the meat and veggies. Fresh drinks every day. The people are nice and super attentive. Place is clean and and properly established and they also have seats for all kinds of family sizes. I highly recommend and would definitely come back to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"I like how the burritos are stuffed with meat and very moist with the beans, pico,  and sour cream. Nothing worse than a dry burrito. I'll be back"}
{"text":"months later after first going here still love this place anyone that comes to town its a must to take them there its like ok you're in vegas yea lets go to the strip and then frijoles! lol every single person I have taken loves it! My cousin from Canada knew about the place and asked me to take him there before I could even make the suggestion. Needless to say this is my favorite place to eat I'm so sad that I will be moving back to California! PLEASE COME TO CALIFORNIA FRIJOLES!!!"}
{"text":"So good & fresh ! Their pineapple water is so yummy as well! Shrimp quesadilla is very tasty . So glad this is down the street from me !"}
{"text":"Excellent food, did not disappoint. Ordered al pastor burrito with everything and it was fantastic."}
{"text":"On entering I realized we had been previously dined at this location when it was another Mexican eatery.  This is another fast casual restaurant where you order at the counter and servers bring the food to you.  My wife ordered a (large) soft taco that was filled with chicken, beans, cilantro, guacamole, and pico de gallo.  I chose a pair of mini (street) tacos with al pastor, cilantro, pineapple and onion. The quantity of meat was above average, but the flavor was lacking.  I also noticed that although an al pastor was positioned on an upright spit, the meat for my taco had not been sliced to order."}
{"text":"Not a bad spot for some tacos and agua fresca, which are fruit and or veggie infused water, usually sweetened. Prices are very reasonable and depending on what you get it could be more or less bang for your buck. I ordered the al pastor taco and a kid's chicken quesadilla. The al pastor taco was a good size for $4 and some odd change and it was tasty. The kid's menu quesdilla was more of a taco than my image of a flour tortilla folded in half with melted cheese. Will not order again, but the tacos I would. I also had their jamaica ( hibiscus ) agua fresca. It was refreshing and not too sweet. Too often agua frescas are loaded up on sugar and you can't taste the delicate fruit, veggie, or in this case floral flavor. The different salas were good too. There was a green one, a darker green one and a red one. The green one was not spicy, but flavorful, the darker green one had more of a smokey grilled flavor and the red one was spicier and kinda smokey. The place was busy for Saturday lunch and they are closed on Sundays. It is also very clean and the workers were quick and helpful. I would come back again to try their other tacos and some more agua frescas."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times during the past couple of years, but it wasn't until I tried the tacos that I really fell in love with this place! I get the chicken taco, no sour cream, and I love their green sauce! The red sauce is a little hot for me. And if you use the Yelp offer like I did ... For one dollar extra I got a refreshing mango Fresca! Love this place and the tacos are the best!"}
{"text":"Wow, I'm pleasantly surprised! I'm from San Antonio so when it comes to Mexican food I have high expectations and honestly have yet to find a place in Vegas that is even comparable to San Antonio places but this place was good! No, it's not authentic Mexican food, more like Tex-mex but it was good. The restaurant was super clean and staff greeted us immediately. You order at the counter and they give you a number. They bring the food to you so just sit back and relax. 

I saw Aguas Frescas on the menu and had to order some and mmmm mmm it was good. The watermelon was so fresh and just fabulous. Reminds me of the stuff that I would get at Fiesta in San Antonio. The salsa with the chips was more like pico de gallo but you could tell that they use real fresh produce so I'm not complaining about that. 

Now for the main course I had mini tacos al pastor. Great flavor! I once had tacos al pastor in Puerto Vallarta and have not been able to find that fabulous taste again until today. Their corn tortillas were fluffy and light and the meat was perfectly marinated and tender. Yum! And if you read my reviews you know I had to try my fiancé's quesadilla and chicken taco and everything was delicious. Oh and the rice and beans were some of the best I've had. The rice was fluffy and flavorful, I hate when the Mexican restaurants make the rice all soggy, Mexican rice and beans are staple at Mexican restaurants. If you get anything right it should be the rice and beans and this place does it right. Love that it's near where we live! I'll be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Not as good as I expected. I ordered the \"Fish\" Platter and horchata drink. I asked the cashier what kind of fish is served with the platter, she said Tilapia. Unfortunately, she was wrong. The \"Tilapia\" is actually TUNA FISH. No bueno :/ The horchata was weak in flavor. My friend was also misinformed. She was told the rice had no onions, but it was wrong. She could not eat it due to food allergies. 
We will not be back. 
The restaurant was clean, had not issues finding parking, food presentation was ok, location was ok, service was so so."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I have had in town!! The tacos are huge and so delicious. And the beans oh my goodness so good. And all of there homemade drinks are to die for! The service was fast and friendly and all the food was so fresh. Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Can I say delicioso!! The tacos are fully loaded with guacamole, pico de gallo, sour cream, and beans. There is a lot of Mexican joints around the valley that are pretty much have the same concept. This place is a little different its def worth the drive! The reason why I'm giving it 3 stars... The price. It's TOO over priced!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food here! we got a shrimp quesadilla,  Carne asada fries and elote. as a bonus for checking in we received a free Fresca! I went with a lime cucumber pineapple combo, very tasty. the shrimp quesadilla was stuffed with veggies , I enjoyed the flavour of the Carne asada and the elote was great you can watch them grill it for you. servers were also very friendly."}
{"text":"Excellent $5.00 Taco. I only ordered one Chicken Taco. Quality ingredients, fresh made, chicken was seasoned well. Friendly staff, (well, at least the cashier was nice, the other gal- not so friendly). Bathroom was clean. I will stop by again if I'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Carne Asada Carne Asada Carne Asada!!!
they have street corn 
the salsas are on point and have lots of flavor! 
come try it!
The nachos, tacos, churros and agua frescas are fantastic. 
The employees are all so nice and welcoming.
Inside the place is always very clean and updated."}
{"text":"The food was amazing!!! Loved the atmosphere of the restaurant from decoration to music. Would have gave 5 stars, but the cashier really had a terrible attitude. 

I suppose we can say that everyone has a bad day...just sux it was my first impression of the restaurant."}
{"text":"This has to be amazing service! The restaurant looks very well clean and organized. I ordered by phone with Greg and he was very nice and helpful. He also called me back to give me additional options that I forgot to tell him. The food was really good."}
{"text":"I had no idea this place existed. Easily the freshest Mexican food In Vegas. I'm going here so much more now and I guess they have 4 locations. Highly recommend the pork burrito and their spinach drink. So tasty. I'm gonna go back for dinner tonight too. Friendly professional staff."}
{"text":"This is a hole in the wall mom and pop kind of place. I like how they have it decorated with an open and clean concept. It reminds me of Chipotle, but more authentic Mexican food. 

My husband and I have been here a few times and we keep coming back. The food is very good and consistent. My favorite are their fresh fruit juices. Looks like I will be here more often specially that summer is just around the corner.

We have not tried their dessert, and the cheesecake chimichanga caught my eye. I will try next time I stop by for a drink."}
{"text":"The closest to authentic that you'll get, amazing food my favorite is the chicken quesadilla! But then again you can never go wrong with tacos! Their shrimp salads are pretty amazing also, can't say anything negative about anything on their menu. Don't forget to grab an agua fresca, so fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is really clean and fast. Food is great. Will definitely be coming back. Prices very affordable."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, and fast. The Aguas Frescas were amazing!  We paid the extra $1 to upgrade the meal. So worth it!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch. I ordered the 2 mini taco plate combo and upgraded my drink to a 20 oz Fresca. The fish taco had a fresh sauce that complemented the grilled fish. Their al pastor was amazing, but I have to say, tacos el gordo al pastor is better. Their mini tacos are basically street tacos but with more toppings than usual. I ordered the cucumber Fresca and could taste that it was fresh because of the pulp. If you don't like pulp in your drinks, then you might want to stay away from their frescas. Overall, it's a great spot for lunch and I would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. And their cucumber lemonade is fantastic. 

But on my latest visit, it took over 30 minutes for me to get my food, and they still got it wrong. They also screwed up my friend's order. Ask for any kind of customizations and they don't listen. 

Sorry to say it, I'll have a hard time coming back here!"}
{"text":"The peeps who work here are really nice. Anything al pastor is amazing! And the frescas are sooo yummy."}
{"text":"One of my favorite taco places! Everything is made fresh. The al pastor tacos are delicious & savory. If you're eating here or just need something refreshing to drink get the frescas! There are lots of flavors to choose from & you're more than welcome to mix flavors as well. My favorite fresca to order is mango strawberry. 

Besides the amazing food, all the ladies that work here are wonderful & kind. I've been to this location plenty of times & I've never had anything but a great experience!"}
{"text":"Sweet bananas! I love this place. I got the al pastor taco, which has guacamole on it  and a mini shrimp quesadilla and both of them were so good. I've been telling everyone about this place since I found it last week. I've already been twice in a week. I love their salsa also, spicy and flavorful. The Pico is one of my favorite things."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place. The staff was very friendly and attentive. It was 7.50 for a carne asada burrito. My impression was that the price was ok...the burrito was average. I would say it was lacking a proper amount of meat. It wasn't horrible but there are places in town that are less priced with bigger servings. It wasn't bad,it just didn't blow my hair back. I think if they increase the size of their servings it would improve my opinion. The togo bag was also packed with a red and a green salsa which I thought was a nice touch. There was no salsa bar which I like but again it wasn't the end of the world,just average."}
{"text":"Easily One of the best Mexican places I've ever had. I especially like their fresh drinks. It's difficult to top their fresh ingredients and meets. I love their al pastor! And the service is always friendly. Can't say enough good things about this place. Worth the drive."}
{"text":"Great food and agua frescas! Love the chicken burrito- comes with avocado no extra charge!"}
{"text":"this place is the worst! they always change their portions of food on me and they are rude! the manager always gives me dirty looks and it sucks b/c shes the manager and if anything she should be nice! shes the skinny mexican lady with a bun, she always gives me an attittude. i even called both stores to complain to see if any of them could do anything about it and its been months and till this day they have not contacted me!!!! i regret ever spending money here!! please stay way from this place!!!"}
{"text":"Always come here for the AL Pastor tacos  + the strawberry and horchata mixed auga fresca! My mouth is watering right now just thinking about how delicious that combo is to me lol"}
{"text":"I come here often with my family so this review is long overdue. The frijoles staff is always friendly and the food never disappoints. I usually order the mini tacos, shrimp cocktail or nachos.  Green and red salas are at each table and you can't leave without  trying an Agua Fresca.  The food is made to order and although a bit pricier than your typical Robertos or other taco shop...you get what you pay for in quality.  We will continue to visit this restaurant :-)"}
{"text":"I didn't like this place on the first few visits but then I discovered that if you say \"No pico\" then you'll be introduced to the most wonderful tasting asada tacos with no onions.They are delicious and filling. Get 3 and you'll be full for dinner."}
{"text":"So since there is no 1/2 stars I give this place a 5. Truly no place is 5 stars but this is close. I was In The mood for Mexican and open yelp. Love the reviews and pictures so I took the chance. It's closed on Sunday's but the reason I like. They take care of their employees. I stepped in and the place is immaculate. It's busy lot of people but the place is still clean. I did not wait long for my food and they suggested several items. I ended up getting a fully loaded burrito. I can not describe the way the burrito tasted. Let's just say. This is my new spot."}
{"text":"Love this spot! Great food, great service, and I'm always greeted by the nicest staff. This is my go to spot in the community that I live in. 

Shrimp tacos are great. Love the shrimp nachos. Sometimes when you order shrimp you get less even though you're paying more. Other than that, I have a great experience."}
{"text":"GUYS, TRY THIS PLACE OUT! 

Ok, seriously, they're delicious! One of my favorite spots to go to. I live close by, thankfully, and come here quite often if I don't want to go too far. Everything is always fresh! 

You order your stuff at the register, pay, and sit. They bring everything to you! Made to order. 

They have a very good amount of things on their menu. I usually go for the tacos or the carne asada fries. Lemme tell you about them fries though! The guacamole was perfect, and the fries were fresh and crispy not burnt! The carne was definitely savory.

This place does not disappoint and I keep coming back for more. I've recommended this place to a lot of people already and everyone fell in love. 

Their desserts are always bomb too. Give the fried ice cream a chance. I don't think its on the menu because it isn't available all the time, but do ask. It was definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Weirdly both times I have come here with my family, the same large family with undisciplined kids were running around and rudely destroying place. Despite that, the food was really good, Frescas were tasty, and the staff kept up and cleaned up quickly for more people to come dine in. Great Mexican food and attentive staff. Thank you."}
{"text":"I am kind of disappointed by the way the salad was prepared. It doesn't look like the salad I wanted. I said everything, but I guess someone decide to put me on a diet & give me not green lettuce. The steak were the weirdest chunks & cold. I doubt I would go back."}
{"text":"I'm officially obsessed with this place. Mexican Is by far my favorite food and they know how to dish out TRUE Mexican food. I live around the corner and just tried this gem and I'll be a regular now. Kudos"}
{"text":"Overall everything was good, but I wouldn't say it was great and I wouldn't seek this place out when there are so many other choices.

You have to order at the counter, then they bring your food out to you.  The chips were probably my favorite part of the meal.  They were obviously freshly made and were warm and crispy.  They came with beans, rice, and pico de gallo.  The beans were great, but the rice was just OK and the pico de gallo was disappointingly bland.  I had the carne asada burrito as the main part, it was short on meat, and what meat it had wasn't flavorful."}
{"text":"You wanna know what I miss most about Mexico besides the authentic food?  The fresh fruit juices, also known as aguas frescas!  You can find them all over Mexico and they even have exotic fruits like Mamey and Guanabana.  When I found out there was a restaurant here that offered aguas frescas I knew I had to try it out.
  
I came here for a light lunch one day and ordered a large cucumber + chia seed drink and 2 tacos.  

The tacos, to my surprise, tasted very authentic.  This is the real deal folks!  I thought it'd be another Americanized type of restaurant.  No, you don't get that delicious and greasy taco truck taste, but you do get an amazing clean grilled taste.  At $2 a pop for the mini tacos I was a fan.  The salsas?  Amazing!  Both the red and green salsas are almost as good as mom makes.  

The star of show is definitely the agua fresca.  You can even sample the juices/waters and mix and match!  There was no pulp which was a welcome surprise.  The large is 32 liquid ounces and definitely filled me up.  

I believe I found my new favorite lunch spot.  The agua fresca is a lot healthier than soft drinks and with the huge variety I'll be dropping by often.  Don't forget to try the salsas!"}
{"text":"I've picked up dinner a few times.. And it's always been good. I order the Carne Asada Salad  for me and the Carne Asada Burrito for my husband and they're both delicious.. Customer service is good as well. I usually always order by phone and food is ready by the time I arrive. Only downside is that they close on Sundays. I will continue visiting this place."}
{"text":"For a restaurant called Frijoles they have a lack of variety when it comes to beans. I want it to be good but the food is boring with little flavor. The only good feature is the Mexican Coke."}
{"text":"Great place for tacos ! Casual atmosphere 
Hot sauce on every table .  Several lunch specials to chose from , with great prices .   
Fast , clean , delicious food !"}
{"text":"Ate the Mini taco meal with Carne asada and carnitas. It was Amazing! The meats were perfectly cooked and they had great flavors. I highly recommend getting the strawberry Aguas Frescas, you will not be disappointed! Will be a repeat customer for sure!"}
{"text":"We tried the Carne asada fries and ceviche tostada 
Both were delicious! It would even better with a Mexican beer haha 

Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Enjoyed my experience at Frijoles and Frescas. Staff was super pleasant after standing in line and ordering you take your number and sit wherever.  I ordered a chicken burrito loaded with everything and a strawberry /mango fresca.  
The burrito was loaded with beans guacamole rice chicken salsa and cream. Very delicious combination.

 The fresca was so refreshing I ended up getting a refill. 

My yelp bff ordered chicken nachos and watermelon fresca and loved the flavor.  One regret was the chips were soggy about halfway thru the plate and took away from the initial appeal. 

We finished the meal with dessert cheescake chimichangas and a big churro, chimicahangas were custard filled sweetness covered in chocolate drizzle were delicious and the better option. The big churro was overcooked so will pass on it next time.

Overall very good meal for a great price. Can definitely taste the freshness in the flavors of the food and drinks.  I will be coming back again.  Vamos a comer!!!"}
{"text":"I would give 6/5 stars if I could ...

After watching the video of the break-in that was edited to make it seem like the thieves were after their delicious tacos, I had to try the place. (I'm a sucker for good marketing.)

I am really glad I did! I told the cashier that I saw that video so we came to check them out. She asked \"so this is your first time here?\" and I said yes. Once we sat down, she brought us samples of their Aguas Frescas, which I've always wanted to try but didn't know where to start. She also brought us a sample of their quesadilla, which was seriously the best quesadilla I've ever had. 

We ordered chicken tacos and carne asada nachos. The food was all very yummy and the place was clean and cute. I'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"We were in town for a wedding and looking for a local place close by. Food was awesome and the prices were very reasonable."}
{"text":"Great stop for tacos, chips, and salsa! We had a snack after going for a hike at Red Rock! A locals favorite!"}
{"text":"Ok so I love this place. The food is delicious, quality and cheap! Plus the wide variety of agua Frescas are amazing. I always choose the watermelon one. It's so darn delicious and fresh I can't bring myself to try any others even though I have tried their horchata and pineapple. They definitely weren't as good as watermelon. 

As far as food, I usually get their carne asada or chicken burrito. It's huge and amazing! I haven't tried any tacos or anything here yet but I'm more of a burrito girl anyways. A long time ago I came here with friends and got my go to, carne asada fries. Honestly don't waste your time getting them here. They seem like frozen ore ida fries and they're not that big or loaded. Save the asada fries for don tortaco! The burritos saved my opinion of this place. 

Also, one time I found a string in my burrito which some people really care about things like that. I just plucked it out and kept eating *shrugs*"}
{"text":"Solid cheap mexican place close to my work. 

they have great salads (surprisingly) with rice, avocado, meat, romaine, tomatos and a salsa like dressing. 

The burritos are okay.  I had a steak burrito, the carne asada was decent but a bit to mushy for my taste. 

they heap guac on their tacos which is good. the el pastor is not the best i've had, but the big tacos are decent for the price. 

LOVE their agua frescas... all are delicious, yes even the spinach. Good place to go if you're looking for a quick fix, but obv does not compare to dirty street tacos from the streets of LA or SD."}
{"text":"I was visiting Vegas for my 30th birthday and decided to eat here. I had the steak and chicken tacos with a watermelon fresca. It came with a side of beans and rice. Girlfriend shared with me a plate of nachos and street corn so we could try it all.

Fantastic! Everything tasted super fresh and the way everything was cooked was a change from the styles i've had here in Atlanta from taco places. 

Needed more Jose Luis tho."}
{"text":"Oh my damn! My new go to! I cannot wait to bring my friends and family here. 
My boyfriend and I went a little overboard ordering. But everyone's review said try everything and we basically did just that. 

For appetizers we got the medium shrimp cocktail and the carne asada nachos. Both were pretty good. The nachos beat any kind of bar nachos out of the park! 

I had to try the shrimp cocktail. It was good however the shrimp were whole and I guess I expected more of a ceviche. 

After we devoured those, I finally got my hands on the main reason I went there. Shrimp tacos. I have been on the hunt for a decent shrimp taco that is going to break the bank. And all I can say is wow! Great flavor and spices, the peppers and onions, just speechless because I'm shoving another taco in my mouth. 

My boyfriend got the chicken taco which is currently in the fridge because we are stuffed but I am positive it will live up to the expectations. 

I can't wait to come back and try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Good little stop...stopped here before and almost forgot about this place but I checked groupon today and there it was $6.00 deal for $12.00...good for two huge tacos and a horchata....delicious"}
{"text":"So I was craving tacos again, shocker! I pulled out my trusty yelp and found this joint. 

As I walked in there was a long line and the stereotypical belligerent lady yelling at the cashier over her order. There was definitely a language barrier because the cashier didn't speak crazy.

The \"cooks\" were making some monstrosity that resembled a taco but you had to double fist that sucka. I pussied out and got the mini tacos cause I'm watching my cholesterol. That's my story and I'm sticking to it.

My order:
Uno de lengua 
Uno de al pastor
Uno de asada
Agua de Piña (comped cause I checked in)

Hot dang! The lengua was fresh, tender, and like butta, none of that chewy, gummy old stuff you get at most places. The asada was also fresh and perfectly cooked, not burnt to a jerky. The al pastor was ok.

The best part, aside from the food, was the staff. They were all smiles as they were comadriando with the regulars, despite the cooky woman lingering at the counter.

Next time I'll try the frijoles."}
{"text":"Well i love the Aguas frescas and the service. I'm going back. The tortilla should be fresh make a Mano pero  la asen medio doradita y queda delicious,the salsas are good no to spicy just right."}
{"text":"Good tacos at a good price. 
Super fresh and they have different aguas frescas. Which if it's a legit Mexican restaurant. It should have aguas frescas. See like everything they do here is home made nothing from a can. Which is nice to see. I will definitely come back to try all they're combinations of aguas frescas."}
{"text":"Words can't describe how good the steak burrito was. I highly recommend it.

The horchata is homemade and tastes amazing. 

The restaurant is clean as well. There is ample parking. I will be returning here whenever I'm in town."}
{"text":"The food is definitely fresh tasting and made to order!  They are quick to make your order and delivery it to your seating.  The burritos are on the smaller end in size and each costs about $6-7 dollars.  I've gotten bigger burritos for the same price elsewhere.  Nothing spectacular but a decent place to get Mexican food.  I'd choose the asada over the carnitas.  Also there veggie burrito is filled with avacado and lots of cheese! I did love that!"}
{"text":"While looking for a good taco restaurant to enjoy on a regular basis, my wife and I found bad customer service from the cashier on Tue June 5th at 3:20PM who had an unpleasant attitude fit for a prison cafeteria lady. The food was sub par as my \"carne asada\" burrito was more like a bean burrito. Maybe their skimping on meat to recover the cost for their interior. The only appealing thing about it was the inside. Go ahead and pat your interior designer on the back because that was the only enjoyable part of my visit."}
{"text":"First visit was a 4 star visit. Second visit was a totally different experience. The food is consistent and good. We happened to go when they were busy and unfortunately the service was really poor. I was left for 10 minutes without my food while the others food got cold. When we asked the food runner about it she claimed to not speak English. Because you pay and tip when you order there isn't much you can do about the service. While I like so many things about the food here I can't see myself rushing back unless I want to eat at an off the norm time."}
{"text":"This place was a good find. 

Had the marinated pork and carne asada burritos. Prices were fair and they did not go cheap on the burrito fillings in terms of loading it with rice to make it appear huge (I'm looking at you Baja Taco on Ft. Apache). Lots of meat, sour cream and avocado when I told the guy \"everything\".

The only thing missing here would be a nice salsa bar but the burrito itself with a little salsa verde squirt did the job and was plenty flavorful.

A tasty little place with a simple menu, good food and excellent service...will go back."}
{"text":"Reminds me of chipotle but better. More authentic than chipotle of course.  I had the pollo salad. It's a big salad with fresh avocado pinto beans tomatoes lettuce rice with avocado dressing. $8.10 not bad for a pretty for the most part healthy salad. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I am so glad I found this place. Close to my work and also my home. So far I have tried the Carne Asada Nachos and the Carne Asada Tacos both were very delicious and very fresh. I also enjoyed their fresh juices they make. They also make a delicious chicken quesadilla. Everyone in my office is very pleased we found this place, we have started going there every Friday. It's such a treat. It's also great to show support to the family owned restaurants in Vegas. 

Everything at Frijoles is fresh and you can taste it. They make there beans fresh everyday along with all their juices. 

I will continue to go here and spread the word about them to more and more people."}
{"text":"Aye Mama! Have driven past here a million times with my wife and every time have commented to her that we should try that place. Well finally we DID try it, and I have to say, very happy that we did.

The flavors are rich and deep/complex, the menu is satisfying with its choices. I typically will go for the al pastor and it is very good here. They are happy to give you samples of all the frescas that they have, I recommend the horchata myself.

My only gripe is that their portions are not as generous as I would like from a Mexican resturaunt. However I have yet to not leave there full, just not stuffed."}
{"text":"Good little place for tacos and burritos. Place was clean, staff was friendly, food wasn't bad either. Definitely using a frsh product. I would say that it's very similar to Cafe Rio however I personally like this place slightly better."}
{"text":"Very delicious food. I had a pastor burrito and it was excellent. I also had a pineapple agua Fresca and It was real good and natural from scratch. The taco of lengua was salty. And the quesadilla was alright. I do recommend this place . Very clean and the staff very nice ."}
{"text":"Hands down, my favorite spot in Vegas at the moment. Food is always so tasty and fresh and the employees are always super nice. The Mango fresca is delicious. I've taken a few of my coworkers to try it and they all end up falling in love. Keep up the amazing work!!"}
{"text":"My new favorite taco place. Everything was fresh and flavorful! Hit the spot, the taco pastor was perfect. Cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"I love the carne asada burritos. The steak has great flavor. The fruit drinks are delicious!"}
{"text":"Consistently great food with very fresh ingredients.  I've been coming here for over 2 years and always get great food and service.  The Al Pastor is AWESOME!"}
{"text":"Good Food, good prices, walking distance from work what more can one ask for? Maybe delivery  service lol"}
{"text":"One of our favorite places in Vegas !! Not close to the strip but that's why we love it.  We always get the chicken street tacos & street Mexican corn- major food-gasm ! 
Every time I'm in town, this is one of my go to spots for tacos."}
{"text":"We only ended up here because the place we wanted to try was unexpected closed. It turned out to be a happy accident as the food and service were outstanding. I especially enjoyed the frijoles, which were white as opposed to pinto or black bean; the flavor was amazing. I will definitely return on my next visit."}
{"text":"Ok let's start by saying I love Mexican food.  I think it would be safe to call me a connoisseur of Mexican food!  

Cesar Q. and I were starving so thanks to some great yelp reviews and pictures we decided to stop by this place.  

This place is unique.  You stand in line to place your order and then go take your seat.  Someone brings your food out to you.  So I guess this is considered \"fast casual\".  

I ordered the carnitas/pork nachos and the husband ordered a chicken quesadilla.  Prices were reasonable but portions were a bit small in comparison to what we had expected.  My nachos filled me up but I wasn't about to split.  The hubs felt the quesadilla was way to small for the price paid.  We ended up ordering the shrimp cocktail to make up for what we had already ordered.  

I would recommend the shrimp cocktail as it is great!  The rest of the food was just so/so.  

What really annoys me is that while placing our order  while standing in line and paying there is a tip option on the receipt.  It's like going to Mc Donald's and tipping. You just don't do it.  Now that it's on my receipt I feel obligated to tip.  So of course I tip.  My food is brought out and no drinks on the tray.  I ask for water and the girl points to the ice water on the counter and tells me to do it myself.  I would like my tip back thank you very much. What's the point of tipping if your not serving? Ok enough with that.  

The food did not leave me thinking \"I need to come back\" like some places do...."}
{"text":"Great friendly service and good food too.  I made a quick trip in to pick up my lunch and ate at my desk at work.

I ordered and was told my food would be ready in 10 minutes.  I arrived and it was piping hot and ready.  I ordered nachos today and they were great.  Crispy and they are generous with the guacamole.  This is always a plus.

If I had to find a negative it's that they are closed on Sundays.  There is a polite message on the front door explaining that they give their staff Sunday's off to spend with their families.  I do think this is very nice however I do think it is odd that  a business closes on day's their customers are off.  Just a personal opinion.  I found this out when my hubs and I attempted to place a to go order over the weekend.  

This location is on the corner of Rainbow and Tropicana.  It is bright and cheery inside."}
{"text":"Good food, reasonable prices, clean location, easy parking, casual atmosphere and I would return."}
{"text":"We came here off of a whim and so glad that we did . Fresh , homemade authentic Mexican food is what I would use to describe to place . This by far surpasses any robertos or don tor taco type taco shop . It would be a shame to even catorgize them with those taco shops .  
Your order with cashier thAt is aligned next to ppl making fresh food ( almost like chipotle) . The menu is basic and easy to follow. Then you sit at a table and your food is brought to you .  The service was so welcoming and polite and the food was even better . I wish I lived closer to this place because I would be there all the time . 
Plus they have street corn ( good authentic street corn ) !!!!"}
{"text":"Tostada and burrito meals were awesome! One of the BEST fast Mexican restaurants! Food prepared FRESH - salsa was mild and flavorful. Meals came with avocado and didn't charge extra! VERY REASONABLE!"}
{"text":"Frijoles and Frescas is around the corner from my place, and I've been wanting to try it for a while now. 

The other day, my husband and I decided to head over for lunch.

The restaurant itself, is open, and clean.  It has a kind of fast-ish food feel (like Fatburger.  Technically fast food, but not like McDonald's fast.), and a decent menu.

We ordered:  veggie nachos, a chicken burrito, and a shrimp taco.

The nachos were ok.  The toppings were put on in sections...sour cream on one side, salsa/veg on the other, so that was weird...I had to mix my own nachos.  They tasted ok, but I can get better nachos at Del Taco, and they're cheaper. 

My fella had the burrito and shrimp taco, and while he said they were ok...he said they both were WAY too spicy.  This is saying something, coming from him, because he loves spicy food.  

I'm glad we tried it, but we probably won't be back."}
{"text":"The food was excellent!!! I order the tacos with chicken and they are big and yummy!!! Got a strawberry water and it's super fresh!!! Service was friendly!!!"}
{"text":"I hoarfed down a big taco and was stuffed but still ate my baby's quesadilla.  My mom inhaled her salad and wanted to kiss the cook! We  frijoles!"}
{"text":"Frijoles & Frescas Grilled Tacos is nothing to get excited about. Yes, the beans are pretty good and my family got a kick out the staff's \"How you bean?\" t-shirts, but I was pretty underwhelmed with what Frijoles and Frescas had to offer.

VEGETARIAN BURRITO ($6.49): When I get a burrito at a legit Mexican joint, I'm expecting a humungous burrito with the tortilla struggling to keep the contents inside. Not so at Frijoles and Frescas. I could have ate two of those suckers. Taste wise, it was a-ok. 3/5

TACO ($4.49): Pretty expensive for one taco. My mom said the taco was good but that it's not worth paying $4 for. 3/5

CHIPS & SALSA ($2.00): Paying for chips and salsa is one of my pet peeves. It should be free, dammit!! My dad said he liked Chevy's chips better and I thought the salsa was unexpectedly sweet. I prefer spicy salsa, personally. 2/5

FRIES ($6.99): My husband really liked his loaded nacho fries! 4/5

HORCHATA ($2.50): With a dead serious face: The absolute WORST horchata I've ever had the displeasure of trying. I took one sip and was disgusted. It tasted like I was drinking sand. I must have gotten the absolute bottom of the barrel or something. They brought another horchata out but I didn't want any part of it. I was kind of irked they didn't apologize or offer to refund me. 1/5

VIBE: I did like the set up of Frijoles and Frescas and the customer service was great (as far as greeting customers and saying goodbye). I'd call it an upscale taco shop. It took about 15 - 20 minutes to get our food, and they brought the chips out after the food, so there was some disorganization. A steady stream of customers kept rolling in through the door.  3/5  

Worth a Return Visit?
At least I got to cross Frijoles and Frescas off my list of bookmarks. I won't be coming back, however. The taqueria down the street from my house is way better!

YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #90"}
{"text":"First time here. What a great find. Food is fresh. Carne Asada taco was delicious. Beans are fresh and not canned. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic street tacos, look no further. The mini tacos are simple...simply delicious and the selection of aguas frescas will quench the thirst of any parched Las Vegan on one of our hot summer days."}
{"text":"Once upon a time, I was hungry and my mom happened to be hungry too. Deciding we wanted Mexican, I opened my faithful Yelp app and searched for bookmarks. Frijoles was right around the corner, so to Bean Town we went.

Back in the day, this location as a Pizza Hut. The whole place was updated. The same layout, but now without a tacky salad bar in the middle. Ample table and chairs and several booths. The dining area had soft accents of Mexican art and was incredibly clean. 

Frijoles is Roberto's Taco Shop crossed with a Chipotle with a casual cafe feel, with it's simple menu, which consists of Mexican styled meats, you then take the meat a spruce it up as a: mini taco, salad, nachos, taco, fries, or a platter. Drink-wise, your standard Coca-Cola products, Mexican Cokes, and Agua Fresca.

I got a carne asada and an al pastor mini taco, Mexican street corn, and a strawberry-mango agua fresca; my mama ordered the salad with shrimp and an order of chips and salsa. Everything tasted fresh. The chips and salsa were chips and pico. My tacos and corn were good. Not Taco y Taco good, but definitely well above Robertos or Pepes. The shrimp salad was stellar. I had order envy after I tasted that creation. Definitely know I will be venturing that route next. Agua Fresca was also a happy surprise. Feeling fancy, I combined two flavors. Sweet, but not in the \"I'm gonna get diabeetus way,\" but in a perfectly ripe strawberry and mango way, just FRESH.

Frijoles is nice option. Nothing that knocked my socks off, nothing that I hated. Authentic, no. Tasty, yes. How can i not like anything that bears the same name as my beloved cat, Beans? Me gusta Frijoles."}
{"text":"So good! Think fast casual Mexican, but more authentic than Chipolte and that garbage Cafe Rio place. Hands down my favorite place for Mexican in Las Vegas. 

I recommend:
Carne Asada Burrito
Chicken Nachos
Tacos Al Pastor with beans and rice

Also, try their Agua Frescas!!!!"}
{"text":"I went to frijoles tonight This is the second time I came to the place and its definitely the best Mexican food I ever had here in las vegas the carne asada burrito is the bomb and the green sauce oh boy!  Kudos frijoles you got a new customer"}
{"text":"I love their Strawberry Fresca drink and that is a must have every time i go there. I also like their carne asada quesadilla. The place is cozy and usually pretty busy. I also like the fact that I can order mexican street corn here. All and all happy with my experience."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time for dinner with my sister and brother in law. Had a Carne asada quesadilla and pastor tacos. Excellent. I also had this spinach strawberry pineapple drink which was the bomb. Definitely coming back again. Even though we came 20 minutes til closing they were all very friendly let us stay, enjoy our food, etc even after closing. Great service and great food. Thank you"}
{"text":"Awesome authentic Mexican food. Good quality. Love this place, wish they had more locations."}
{"text":"I really liked this place! I had a carnitas quesadilla and it was AMAZING! Everything tasted great and fresh. My bf had a lengua burrito and it was also really tasty and juicy. Speaking of juices....their agua frescas are so refreshing and good! Tbh it was one of my first times trying aqua fresca, and it was better than expected. It had just the right amount of sweetness, perfect for a hot vegas day."}
{"text":"It's very good. Like most people who grew up in the west I've eaten a ton of Mexican food in my life. I didn't give a full 5 star rating just because there's no great surprise here. It's on par with a lot of other delicious Mexican restaurants here in town. If you're in the area stop by but I wouldn't drive across town to get there."}
{"text":"Great food. All the ingredients are fresh. The staff was always cutting and prepping. The server was very nice and was smiling and genuinely cared if we enjoyed our meal. 
I ordered a chicken salad and my wife ordered chicken quesadilla, and of Course two Mexican corns which were amazing and only 2 bucks!! I will come back without question. Oh and they have real Mexican coke which is a plus."}
{"text":"I came by today for some more fantastic food. My favorite is the street corn. It is spot on again.
I usually get the same thing, but today I tried a platter. I got the marinated pork and it was fantastic. Everything I get here is always great. I will be back. This is my second visit this week."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. I give it 3 1/2 stars... I love the freshness of their food. I absolutely love their drinks. Their frijoles really are amazing. Someone noted that it's not authentic, I think it is. Just because it's better quality food does not mean it's not authentic. I will definitely be revisiting."}
{"text":"My second time here, came about nine months ago and the experience was really good, now several months later, It's still pretty good.

Today my husband and I tried a few new things, a salad, a burrito and their version of ceviche. 

Salad was big with rice and beans, plenty of greens and salas, choice of meat, we tried the pork, tender chunks, moist and cripsy at the same time. 

Burrito was carne asada and also had rice and beans, generous portion and flavorable. 

The shrimp ceviche was a tall beer stein full of plenty of shrimp, chunks of guacamole, shreded cilantro all in spicy tomato juice. 

The menu offers many choices, the drinks look refreshing although we did not try some today, they're on the list for next time. The  food is fresh and tasty. Good experince and we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Popped in and grabbed a carne asada burrito. Not too bad but nothing stands out to me. Flavor was OK but nothing remarkable. Size was okay for the price but was a little lacking in my opinion.

However, very friendly service from the ladies at F&FGT"}
{"text":"Stopped thru for lunch on a Monday and it turned out to be a pretty good move. I Chose the #3 (burro meal) w chips/salsa n jamaica to drink.. The carne was grilled and seasoned nicely, hold the beans Por favòr.... No complaints on the burrito at all, flavor and ingredients were fresh and to my liking. Chips n salsa were plentiful and actually more than enough.. I prefer the green tomatillo sauce rather than the red.. They do it fresh here and seemed to be on point. Ordered up n paid n food was brought out to table several minutes later after the chips n salsa... Id recommend this placed ur in the area and I'll def be back to try more items on the menu. Seems to be a \"go to\" spot for those that \"know what's up\"! Jamaica was on ice and helped finish Monday's lunch off!! Good move, get it in at this spot if r in this side of town! Look forward to trying more of their menu items.. Lots of seating and inside decor is welcoming and quaint.."}
{"text":"Amazing all around experience, told the cashier it was our first time and she took the time to explain the menu to us. When the food came out it was hot and tasted amazing. The staff was busy but we're still friendly. The restaurant was clean even with all the customers in there. We will defiantly be coming back time and time again."}
{"text":"This is a great Mexican restaurant on the corner of the street in a strip mall. The food is so good that I gave it a 5 mostly for the food. It's not a first date place, but it's place that knows how to cook up some solid burritos, quesadillas and carnitas.I'm sure everything on the menu is excellent. I'll be finding out regularly"}
{"text":"We ordered lunch from here today. 2 of us got food poisoning from the food. We were at work and were throwing up for hours. We know it was this place since this is all we are all day."}
{"text":"Boooringggg.
Was like hospital cafeteria fare.
Everything seemed so bland. Had to drown it in the 2 tableside salsas they offered.
Ordered chicken tacos (okay, how can you mess that up?)
Bean and cheese burrito (was there cheese in there?)
And carne asada fries. (Soggy and puny.)

Perhaps we ordered wrong? All the rave reviews seem to be coming from the frescas...didnt even see any jugs of them out like at Marianas or Cardenas. Perhaps this is just too 'safe' mexican for me? 
Idk. The staff was super nice though."}
{"text":"bad service , they said you have to spend 5 dollars to use your check in coupon when i previously spent 15 dollars they didn't want to give me my drink. She argued and wouldn't listen to my order! Never coming back it's over priced and very rude service i'm very upset. The person who served me was Rocio ."}
{"text":"Good food but mediocre service. I enjoyed the carne asada quesadilla with red sauce. The horchata was great as well but the lady working there had an attitude."}
{"text":"I'm conflicted about this review, because I did like it. I'm wondering if a different location would do it for me.

I had the steak quesadilla and guacamole with chips. I'm not afraid of grease and fat by any means, but my quesadilla was swimming in grease. The bottom side of the tortilla got so soggy that toppings were falling out. It was a mess. Flavorwise it was tasty. The steak was well seasoned and there was plenty of cheese. 

The husband ordered tacos, we don't remember what kind. He got his to go and it was so greasy that the paper bag tore. He did enjoy them and says he wishes there were more. 

The guacamole was small for the price. It had too much raw onion for my taste. It's not something that I would order again from there in a hurry.

I enjoyed the different salsas at the table."}
{"text":"My daughter took me here, and I cannot say anything but GOOD stuff about my experience here!!  EXCELLENT food and drinks.  Great prices too!!  I'm a fan!!"}
{"text":"Been here twice has really friendly employees the food is nice the drinks are delicious"}
{"text":"SO GOOODDD... My husband and I have tried the Al Pastor taco, shrimp taco, carne asada burrito,taco,and nachos,  chicken burrito, the corn. .. you can't go wrong with anything here! The tacos are super filling.You can actually taste the smokiness on the meat  from the grill. My favorite was definitely the al pastor. Spicy.. sweet goodness. Everything is made fresh. .The only problem I ran into today was that they gave me the wrong drink and didn't give me my corn. (I had to wait in line, go to the counter and ask). Other than that,  they were great! One things for sure, I will NEVER go back to Robertos for my mexican fast food ."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner. Never been here before. Restaurant was very dated. I ordered the nachos they were pretty good. Could have been a bigger portion size. Watermelon Fresca was really good."}
{"text":"I loved this place. The tacos and quesadillas are really good and I love the beans. It reminds me of Los Tacos. I wonder if it may even be the same owners. The food is very similar and they both use the Peruvian beans."}
{"text":"Not sure how you guys grew up, but have you ever went to the swap meet to get some fresh fruit drinks or have you ever bought corn from the man on the streets and add everything on it ... Yes?  Frijoles and Frescas bringing not sexy back, but my childhood memories.   

Grilled tacos, burritos, quesadillas, nachos and more.   
Every time I go here I try a different Fresca flavored drink and definitely get the street corn.   So far, the mango and cucumber are at the top of my list, but you can mix whatever your heart desires."}
{"text":"Let me tell you something Veronica was outstanding first time there it was a incredible experience and she made it happen she gave us samples of the aguas frescas and made our decision making for dinner easy to choose. She really went above and beyond with her customer service you should really be proud of have such a great employee working for you.Definitely be back again oh and the food was fantastic and aguas frescas were also and refreshing can't wait to come back.  Again thank you Veronica keep up the great work."}
{"text":"Takes a lot to impress me, especially with mexican food. Great ingredients. Proper portions for the price. And the flavor is amazing. If your not coming to my kitchen! Go to frijoles. Lol"}
{"text":"It was really clean and nice staff... but the food was not good at all. I mean had no flavor at all just starting with the beans and rice. Literally I don't think they could have made it any more bland... then I had the shrimp tacos, the presentation looked really good. But it was just dripping in grease. And usually when it's doing that it's gonna be good but nope. Very disappointed, I had high expectations from reading all the other reviews. Me and my husband spent $30 bucks to just throw it all away. I would have gave McDonald's a higher rating than this place."}
{"text":"The meat is all freshly grilled and the guacamole is fantastic! Haven't had anything disappointing here."}
{"text":"Place is ok. Its pretty good i suppose but the pricing is waaayyyyy too expensive for what they give you. Ive had better food for cheaper. But ill give it an extra star because the agua frescas were delicious. I would come back more often if it wasnt so expensive."}
{"text":"Very reasonable prices, I ordered a burrito half chicken and half steak for 6.95. It was made and delivered within 5 minutes and was hot and ready to eat. The burrito was none the less outstanding very good food here. I will be back"}
{"text":"Addicted! Shrimp cocktail.  The Watermelon Agua Fresca is delcious and refreshing."}
{"text":"First, I would like to say we crashed their soft opening for their family and friends. But they welcomed us  in anyways. We had the chicken and carne asada tacos. They were wonderful, it was like a real street taco. Everything your looking for a soft, cheesy corn tortilla filled with beans, meat and all the yummy fixins. I will say I am a meat snob, I loved the carne asada. It was tender and had a real savory flavor...secret recipe?? It was really great.  It was so yummy I am taking the kids over today, so we can be a paying customer."}
{"text":"I just want to say, first time here and the customer service was excellent . Patricia I believe was the lady who took our order had incredible patience and helped out with what she recommends, also got chips and salsa while we waited for our food, and food came quicker then I thought . Amazing place to eat and the food is excellent as well ."}
{"text":"Best burrito I've had in a while. Haven't had one with sour cream but it was amazing !"}
{"text":"Found this cool Mexican place with a great menu and fresh food. Nice environment and fast service. Would come again."}
{"text":"Yaaaaaaas the chicken quesadilla was the best quesadilla I've ever had and I've had a lot of quesadillas in my day. Great service and delicious food okay thank you"}
{"text":"The service, and quality of food and drinks at this establishment is off the wall!!!!!!!
I love it. There's one particular cashier that's very personable and makes a point of making you feel welcome. 

You should stop by JUST for a spinach or cucumber drink. They're REALLY, REALLY good, and healthy too!!"}
{"text":"This place doesn't open until 11 am and is closed on Sundays. On the door, it states the place is closed on Sundays so the restaurant can be with their family. Guess they don't want business on Sundays. The food is good, but prices are on the high end. The service is nothing special. There are a few lunch specials which are price reasonable. No salsa bar. Salsa is in plastic bottles on each table."}
{"text":"Had heard great things about the charleston location.
Visited the location at meadows mall. 
Good flavour for the steak taco but hardly worth the cost. 1 taco with some flavorless rice and beans for over $8. 
Definitely wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I frequent this location despite living off of Boulder highway however this might be my last visit since service has recently declined. My last visit it was like pulling teeth to get our order in its entirety at once and after having to ask for our frescas twice we were brought water cups... this visit I asked for 6 sides of salsa for my to go order with the cashier she  said okay and I paid for my order. When I was waiting for the order the girl asked me if 3 was enough I said I asked for 6, she then sat there and told me I could have 4... I asked your cashier, if there were a charge for the extra sauce it should have been applied when I asked her for 6. Then after stating I asked for 6 she said I could have 5... mind you the little cups aren't even full so asking for 6 cups is really like asking for 3 full cups. I've never had to barter for salsa before and sure didn't appreciate it after spending almost 30 dollars on my to go order."}
{"text":"Man, I wish we had a place like this in Anchorage!

Fantastic, flavorful Mexican food, served quickly with a smile!

Portions are large, great red and green sauces at the tables.

I got a salad with extra meat and extra avocado.  It was just about perfect.

So much so that I got it twice...during a 4-day visit to Red Rocks...where most of the time was spent camping.

Definitely worth a stop.  Everything my co-workers got also looked great: burritos, tacos, quesadillas."}
{"text":"Hidden in a shopping center at the northwest corner of Rainbow and Tropicana is Frijoles & Frescas.  First trip I decided to try the combo with two mini tacos along with rice and beans on the side.  Also tried the watermelon fresca which tasted like betting into a juicy watermelon maybe a tad too sweet but very refreshing coupled with the rest of the meal.  The two taco meats of choice on this trip were al pastor and cabeza.  The cabeza taco was very juicy and tender which would put it ahead of the al pastor taco which had great flavor but the pork may have been a bit dry.  Overall the meal was quite satisfying except for the portions of tacos which quelled my hunger but left me longing for more.  The sides were a bit overwhelming compared to the tacos but I found myself digging into them to get full.  I will definitely go back and try the other dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"The food is OK but pricy..The girls there are rude! When they brought out my food I ask if I could have an extra lime and nobody  gave to to me or brought it out..so I said forget it...then when I went up to the register to ask for something  else the lady  said hold on before  I even said anything  ..she clocked out and says I'm on lunch  now..then 3of them followed clocking out and we're calling a lady to come from the back to help me because  they were on lunch..when I asked for the cup to go ..the lady said that's all you wanted I can't believe  they couldn't help you.. it would have just taken them one second  to help me...they just laughed"}
{"text":"I only ordered two things as I haven't eaten today and I made lasagna for dinner but I've heard great things about this place.  Immediately when you walk in the atmosphere is modern yet inviting. The workers are super sweet and I had a sample of the el pastor which was really yummy and cooked in a Shawarma type style   I ordered Carne Asada Mini Street Taco and Elote the whole reason I came here was for the elote.  

1.  The carne aside mini street taco was amazing for two reasons 1 the homemade tortillas that were the most delicious tortillas I've ever eaten ok top 3 at least I don't want my Latin friends to be insulted because they make amazing tortillas. 

2. The meat wasn't tough or dry and was cooked perfectly.  

The Elote the whole reason I came here since my favorite place closed down. 

My first thought when I bought into the elote was Yassss finally the grilled taste of the corn and the bite of spicy mixed with the Cojita cheese was just what I was waiting for.  Their elote is supreme and I am going to start coming here a lot more than I should.  

This is going to be an amazing place to take my clients.  I recommend anyone and everyone to go here !"}
{"text":"So this is the old Pizza Hut reconverted. It's not as snazzy as the other location but with what they had to work with I think it is a good conversion. 

First off the food is truly amazing the quality of meat is great and this elote is everything ! The way they layer everything each bite is a spark of flavor from different levels sweet from the corn the creaminess butter and the sharpness of the cheese followed by a slight bite from the Chile powder and then to blend it all the lime , some reading the lime juice just brings each individual together as one harmonious family of flavor !! 

If you are looking for just good Mexican Americana food and I say that because it isn't your true traditional Mexican food but it's delicious Mexican food nonetheless 

The workers are always pleasant and smiling eager to make sure each one is happy. I always see a smiling face which is super nice rather than seeing someone with the Groucho mean mug.  

This time I got mini tacos with carne and chicken , elote And that's it.  Next visit and I will be back because the food is so amazing I will try a shrimp burrito! Can't wait 

If you're looking for a great drink they have this homemade cucumber mint drink and omg. I tried some I died it was so brisk and refreshing."}
{"text":"Great customer service. Great food.   Carne asada tacos were right on point .. Everything was cooked perfectly.  We will definitely return and will definitely recommend..."}
{"text":"Spinach agua fresca, carne Asada, el pastor, and the BEANS!  All amazing.  Even better- the staff is always so nice :)"}
{"text":"Decent sized portions. Shrimp cocktail was excellent! Have to say the corn on the cob was very disappointing. Multiple people had to ask the staff to wipe down dirty tables before they sat down to eat. And the service was very slow."}
{"text":"These tacos are huge!!! And they taste really good. I ordered a carnitas taco combo which included rice and beans and came with a soda which I upgraded to their famous horchatas. I got the strawberry horchata and it was so good! I also ordered a mini carne asada taco which is basically a normal sized street taco. The carnitas taco was ginormous and came with guacamole. I left of the pico de gallo and the sour cream. The carnitas was cooked very well and had a lot of flavor. My only disappointment is that in the last two bites I tasted pure garlic which makes me think a clove wasn't taken out of that batch. Other than that I was more than satisfied. I will definitely be going back next time I come to Vegas! Can't wait to try their other horchatas and agua frescas and different tacos, burritos, and quesadillas!!!"}
{"text":"Im from Chicago so Ive had my fair share of authentic mexican food, tacos more specifically. This place has authentic and not so authentic options.

The mini tacos are probably the most authentic thing here since they just come with onion, cilantro, and a squeeze of lime juice. Cant go wrong with a carne asada mini taco here.
Rice and beans are a biiiit on the salty side but still really tasty.

If youre looking for more tex mex style food then go with the regular tacos, they come fully loaded with pinto beans, guac, etc.. burritos are the same.

NOW THE HIGHLIGHT

Those god damn agua frescas man.. I live like .3 miles from this place and in the 1 week Ive been here Ive spent like $40 on these things ($3.50 a piece so you do the math)

Its basically different flavored sweet god like nectar water lol

My favorites are:
Spinach (sounds nasty but it tastes like orange juice)
Watermelon

My absolute favorite which the girl working there recommended is half pineapple and half cucumber. Effing amazing.

I stop by here like every day on the way home to get an agua fresca, it is that good. Just do yourself a favor and get it."}
{"text":"Yum! Love how this place has fresh Mexican food. No guilty feeling after either like the one you get from Roberto's. They have agua frescas which when you get home, go great with gin, extra ice and a splash of club soda."}
{"text":"I discovered this place because of a youtube video posted on reddit. The video showed the placed being burglarized. What made the video interesting was the fact they made the burglars seem as though they really wanted some tacos LOL. But anyway I convinced some of my friends to go because of the video. Well I wasn't disappointed at all, OMG! I had 2 mini tacos (Carne asada & shrimp) and a quesadilla half shrimp/half Carne asada. Well I guess I found my Thursday night dinner spot"}
{"text":"So I heard a slight buzz around my friends so I had to try it for myself, me and my girlfriend can on a super empty stomach. We ordered a shrimp quesadilla, a carne asada burrito, 2 carne asada tacos, chicken nachos, a side of rice and beans and finally 2 aguas frescas both watermelon and mango. 

The shrimp quesadilla was amazing, honestly enough for just one, but my gf and I split it, while a tad bit greasy the grilled onions were amazing. The carne asada burrito was also great anddddd comes with guac what more do I need to say? It was good down to the tortilla. The tacos were very authentic in taste and a definite safe bet. Now for the nachos, they were indeed good, however I felt like they could have been better, perhaps the other meat options may have been a better choice, however overall still good. The rice and beans, definitely authentic, they had the home made taste. The aguas frescas were also good, mango was a tad thick almost like the Costco lagers mango, and the watermelon was fantastic, both great :)"}
{"text":"Based off a recommendation by my good friend, and my other friends desire for shrimp tacos, we decided to stop in here on Friday around 5pm for dinner. Place wasn't too crowded, but more and more kept showing up so that's a good sign. Located on the corner of Antelope and Charleston. 

I ordered the carne asada tostada (3.99), side of mexican corn (2.25) and side of rice and beans (2.00) while my friend had the shrimp taco (8.49 + $1 for shrimp) and the mexican salad. 

Carne asada again had little to no real carne asada flavor, kind of bland. Maybe I'm spoiled with good carne asada, but this wasn't it. Mexican corn was tasty but seemed overpriced. Rice and beans were just so-so. I wasn't overwhelmed by the meal. 

I might try a few other menu items next time, but next time might be a long ways away because I wasn't super impressed and I thought it just a bit too expensive for what you get. Chances are I'll try Triple Play next for the Philly Cheesesteak, located in the same shopping center."}
{"text":"Love the meat combination! 
I had an al pastor salad with fish and a fresh cucumber water on the side..
Wow, amazing! 

It's perfect for this summer. The restaurant is very spacious and the music is great! 

Plus you can place phone orders and your food will be ready in roughly 15min.!"}
{"text":"Best place to eat....EVER!! So bomb! Their tacos, their drinks, their staff. Everything is amazing at this place :) && their funny shirts."}
{"text":"I just discovered this place a few months ago and I have returned countless times. The lengua and al pastor tacos are amazing. I've also had the rice, beans, and a churro which were all great as well. The price is spot on. I will keep coming back here."}
{"text":"Excellent service, clean and the food was really good.  I've driven by a lot and glad we finally stopped.  My husband loves the cucumber drink & I'm in love with the watermellon you have to come and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place!! All the food is wonderful and it's cool how they'll mix agua frescas and horchatas. The staff is great except the one cashier lady is really rude but  I still won't mark anything less than a five star because the food is so good! The manager ( I think) have my sister and I free samples of multiple agua frescas and chicken tacos!"}
{"text":"So good! We went for the first time tonight. Between us, we had a cheese quesadilla, veggie tacos, a mini chicken taco, a carnitas burrito, beans, chips with salsa and watermelon aqua fresca.

Everything was delicious and fresh. It's like Los Tacos, but better! Also the restaurant is clean and newly refurbished. My son and husband both enjoyed it and we will be back."}
{"text":"Best Augua frescas ! I always do different horchattas like mango horchatta , watermelon horchatta  and even strawberry horchatta !!"}
{"text":"I was in the area and craving tacos. It looks like a popular spot since a lot of people were dining past lunch time.  I ordered the mini tacos (al pastor and carne asada). The drinks are really good & they have a variety you can mix&choose from.  The meat was a little dry and not very flavorful.  I wouldn't come back because it wasn't too memorable. I have a very sensitive stomach and I'm positive I got food poisoning from this place."}
{"text":"Frijoles great spot with inexpensive prices and large portions. I'm not easily impressed a simple local restaurant with authentic Mexican food! Shrimp nachos excellent choice."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the hype is about!? I went yesterday for the first time. It is right by my house and I always see they are busy. So I checked it out. 
Positive: 

Staff are very nice and friendly
A wide variety of drinks and juices

And that's about it. I paid $25 for 4 steak tacos, a piece of corn, and a coke.........
The steak was bland, not impressed at all. I have had Mexican food in Mexico, Chicago, New Mexico, Texas, California, all over Vegas, etc. I do not see myself going back or recommending it. Like I said, very friendly people working there though!"}
{"text":"I am so glad I went to this place by accident. I was going to Tasty BBQ Kitchen next door, but it turned out they don't open on Tuesday. Lucky for me, I was super hungry and went Frijoles, since it was right next door. I had the best tacos I have ever had in my life, definitely going back for more."}
{"text":"I have fallen in love with Frijoles y Frescas! This particular location off of West Charleston is my favorite! The staff is Amazing and the Manager Francisco is a real Sweetheart he is truly a Star! I love that you can sample the Agua Frescas, my personal favorite is watermelon with cucumber. I really enjoy the fajitas style shrimp burrito, very flavorful and fresh! This is one of my new favorite spots so I am sure I will soon become a regular!"}
{"text":"Got the Carne asada nachos that were $9.00. Only received about $5.00 worth of food. They were tasty but a small portion.  The place is a old Pizza Hut building , lots of room inside. Staff is very helpful and attentive."}
{"text":"The food was good and I like the fact that they have those fresh drinks there. But they are way too expensive for a fast food Mexican joint. I got a burrito that was almost $7 and not nearly the size it should have been. Each taco $4 which is excessive since I go to a lot of Mexican fast food joints. Let's just say I did it once but that was it for me Roberto's is just as good and right around the corner."}
{"text":"Great place ! Good food (: even thou they don't have alcohol lol every Mexican place should"}
{"text":"Every time I drove by this restaurant, I'd think to myself....is this for real? It's a Mexican restaurant named Beans, with a kidney bean wearing a sombrero on its sign. I'd scoff at it and keep driving to work.  So when my friends asked if I wanted to try this place for dinner the other night, I was very very skeptical. I mean, in my mind, this had to be the most Americanized Mexican restaurant ever, right? 

WRONG. Frijoles & Frescas is actually really really good. The food itself is freshly made, and while not the best Mexican food in town (I hate to say, I prefer the greasy Roberto's carne asada fries), it's pretty decent. They give a good portion, and the carne asada fries are fried fresh. The carne asada itse;f was a little chewy, but had good flavor overall, and the guacamole was great! 

However, my favorite thing here are the Aguas Frescas. Seriously, they are soooo good! And you can mix the flavors! So far, my favorite is spinach & strawberry & cucumber. I will eventually get myself to order the chia seed flavor too...maybe mixed with mango? 

Tip: Refills of Agua Frescas are only $1 :) Soda refills are free. 

Also, I've heard (and seen) that the corn here is delicious....It was so good, my friends forgot to share with me :P"}
{"text":"Slow service, mediocre food, inattentive staff.  I found this restaurant on Yelp and was extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"Been there twice, had the chicken burrito both times and love it!  It's not your typical shredded chicken, it's more like carne asada.  The portion size is perfect, not a huge ball or brick like some places.  

The chips and salsa are just ok. The salsa is basically pico, not salsa so it needs more flavor. The chips could be a little saltier. 

The place is very clean with plenty of seating. The prices are a good value as well. 

Gotta try the carne asada tacos next time!"}
{"text":"We've been here before and even though they are pretty pricey, the flavor is always great. Had a burrito which was very tasty. Quesadilla- also very tasty. And the fresh aguas are always extremely fresh and refreshing.  Good authentic taco shop."}
{"text":"It was my first time here and I loved it!!! Their burritos are huge and taste really good. I loved especially their watermelon drink! It literally tastes  like real fruit! 
The place is very busy and it looks like a lot of locals go there. The stuff is very friendly too. We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"They nailed it!! Great flavor!! Carne asada, al pastor, carnitas, fish tacos and excellent salsa's."}
{"text":"I'm so glad those location has finally found a decent restaurant to live up to this prime location. 

Conveniently located on the corner of Tropicana and Rainbow, there is a surprising lack of good food in this area. Frijoles & Frescas very recently opened up and I'm happy to report that they are just as good food and service-wise as their original location on Charleston.

I ordered the mini taco combination plate that comes with rice and beans and your choice of meat for the tacos and I upgraded my drink to a watermelon juice. The tacos were great. I chose al pastor and they were delicious and seasoned well. I wish they came with pineapple and they had a more extensive salad bar, but otherwise it they were great. The rice and beans were on point and I am always a sucker for watermelon juice. Very refreshing. My mom and I also shared some elote. Not the best I've ever had and a little over cooked, but decent.

Decent prices and a pretty large dining area good for eating in or takeout. I'm glad to have another option in this area for food."}
{"text":"This is a great little spot to grab a quick meal for takeout or to dine in. 

You order at the counter and they have a variety of different menu items a la carte or in meals. I ordered the two mini taco plate with al pastor and lengua tacos. This combination also came with rice and beans as well as a drink. I ordered a Mexican corn to share as well. For two combos and a corn the total was under $20. 

The tacos were really good, my favorite of the two I tried was the al pastor. It was flavorful and they were generous with the meat. The rice and beans were fresh and tasty as well. The corn was grilled, a great addition to the meal.

Everything we tried was great and I'll be back sample more of their menu."}
{"text":"All I have to say is that Frijoles is way over rated, not the worse not the best! My humble opinion is that is over price for the quality the food."}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican casual Mexican places in Vegas. The burritos seem smaller at first, their long and thinner as opposed to some of the other overstuffed burritos. What they seem to lack I size they make up in flavor, DELICIOUS, only complaint is I don't eat pork and I tried some of their al pastor and it was great, might have to get it next time"}
{"text":"My new favorite place in Las Vegas to get tacos, burritos, elotes and agua frescas! I love all the different options for drinks. Salsas were fresh and spicy, but not too spicy. All the tacos were cooked perfect, shells not too greasy and meat was juicy."}
{"text":"I came here after seeing their viral news video when they were robbed.

Atmosphere: What atmosphere? It's very dull inside, quiet, barely any color. Very unlike most Mexican restaurants.

Service: Poor. Was not greeted. Waited at the unmanned register for about 3 minutes. There were no smiles. It was very unwelcoming. When the food was placed on the table.. It was silently placed on the table.. No words, no interaction very humdrum type of stuff here..

Food: I ordered the \"Fries\" with carne asada.. I believe the fries were fried in too low of temperature oil because they were very chewy.. and they were left in too long making a crunchy chewy abomination. The dish was very bland, the Pico De Gallo didn't add any acidity to the plate. The steak while underseasoned did give off a grilled flavor which was nice.. The fries were the big crinkle cut fries which I personally feel is a bad vehicle for carne asada.. My wife had the Chicken salad. She was not very opinionated about.. \"It was just alright for her.\" Seeing as how she eats a lot of salads and has told when her salads are really good, this one is probably not that good but I didn't eat it. We shared an order of Cheesecake Chimichangas. That dish alone earned you another star. It was good, sweet, had this great glaze on it and I can't think of anywhere else you can get them.

Would I come back? Probably not and on top of that I would not recommend it to my friends."}
{"text":"In LOVE with this little Mexican joint!  All of the food and fruit drinks were fresh and delicious and the prices are on point!  The grilled chicken in my burrito was sooo tasty!  Nachos were thick and crunchy - guacamole and salsa were also great."}
{"text":"Delicious food served hot and fresh promptly. The staff is very courteous and friendly. I would eat here everyday if I could. Everything I have had from here has been excellent. The burritos are very well made and filling, they also reheat very well. Do you self a favor and eat here you will not be disappointed. While you are at it be sure to try the house made green And red sauces."}
{"text":"Came here with my hubby one day after our doctors appointment since it was near by and we were craving some Mexican food. The restaurant is across the way from hush puppies and is a small on the inside. 

The seating looked dated, but once you walk in you walk straight to the counter and order. We ordered carne asada and al pastor tacos and a shrimp quesadilla. We did go back for a Watermelon angus Fresca because it looked really good on their menu and got a free drink with yelp check in. 

Overall, the food was good. I enjoyed the watermelon drink more though. I like that they have a location closer to our side of town so I can try other things on their menu when I'm craving Mexican food again."}
