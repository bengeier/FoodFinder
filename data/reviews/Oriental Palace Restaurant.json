{"text":"Tasty as usual!  Yummy ginger beef!  Try the green beans in garlic sauce as well!  Owners and staff are always friendly and make you feel at home."}
{"text":"Amazing! I didn't know a place like this existed in Calgary! About 65 percent of the menu is gluten free and no msg is added. The food tastes great and does not leave you feeling heavy and sick afterwards, even for my family who are not gluten intolerant.    Awesome customer service as well; I ordered from this restaurant on Halloween night and the owner personally delivered it all the way to the deep southeast of Calgary at a very reasonable cost. He says that there is a possibility for a south Calgary opening in the near future! I can't wait :)"}
{"text":"Didn't get what we ordered and tried to make the most of the wrong dishes but we were somewhat disappointed."}
{"text":"How good or bad it is seems to depend a lot on the dish you order. On our first visit we were very happy with what we got, fresh veggies, lots of meat, good taste. The second time we were rather disappointed. Just a small portion of meat, taste was lame and I was still hungry after finishing my plate.  What I really like about this place is that they will cook most of the dishes gluten free if you ask for it! Even the lime chicken was made gluten free. The owner is very friendly. Generally speaking it's a good place, you just need to find a dish you really like :)"}
{"text":"Consistently great food and service. We have been coming to this restaurant for over 10 years. New owners now but food and service have not changed. They treat every customer as they would a friend, as they always have."}
{"text":"Celiacs rejoice! Gluten free Chinese food. My friend mentioned this place to me as they did really good \"healthy\" Chinese food. So checked into them and the reason behind the healthy is they don't use MSG (which is a form of gluten), and I'd say 60% of their dishes they can do gluten free.   Being NFL Sunday at my place we decide Chinese was the pick. We went with chicken fried rice, regular rice, salt & pepper seafood, pork with baby corn and mushrooms, beef and broccoli and chicken with mixed veggies.   All of it was delish and there was no food left. It was Just under $70 and it was delivered in about 40 minutes."}
{"text":"BEST dumplings. Love the Beef with green onions. Overall, food is delicate and delicious. Fresh. Not a huge fan of their wonton soup though.  I think it is new ownership in last couple of years. Seems nice. Questionable use of personal space, but very friendly."}
{"text":"Terrible food!! Don't waste your hard earned money here! Ate there today, what a crime to give people old shrunken green beans that should have been thrown out!!!  Despicable!"}
{"text":"Gluten free Chinese! I promise, I did not react!  Other than being gluten free, it's a pretty common Chinese food place. I enjoy it mostly because I can eat it without being in pain. It is also quite tasty. They have friendly service that can be a little slow as it's usually only one waitress for quite a few tables.  Overall not a bad place to grab a bite of Chinese, especially if you're unable to enjoy gluten!"}
{"text":"We order Hot and Sour soup a couple times a week, but our favorite Chinese place is closed Tuesdays.   This order was a mistake. The smell seemed off, but I decided to give it a taste anyway. Turns out I should have trusted the message my nose was trying to send me.   The Ginger Beef was \"meh\" and the spring rolls were ok, but felt greasy.   Owners seemed like nice people and maybe I've just been spoiled by a unique recipe of Hot & Sour soup at Papa Shunde in Hawkwood.   Maybe there's other dishes that are amazing, but the items on my order won't have me coming back."}
{"text":"Great mom and pop Chinese food restaurant. The owners are always there and remember who you are. The food is very good. We had the ginger beef and Szechwan eggplant. Both were very good. This is our go to Chinese food place. The service is always good."}
{"text":"This is my second take out experience with Oriental Palace and so far food and service have been consistent.  Phoning in the order is quick and easy and they seem to know their menu really well both by the dish name and number.  Time to fill the order has consistenty been 20 minutes and the folks at the restaurant have been really friendly when you arrive to pick up your order.  The food is good, nothing stands out as spectacular or the best Chinese food I've ever had but consistently good.  The ginger beef (I know I know its not really chinese but I like it) is crispy and has a decent amount of sauce.  The Palace Style Chicken is moist and again a good amount of sauce.  Veggies are fresh, crisp and the sauce tasty.  Serving sizes are decent.  At the end of the day likely not different that what I could get at any number of other Chinese restaurants but this one is just down the street, consistently good service and quality and the price is fair compared to others.  This will be my source for Chinese and I'd love to give it more stars but 3 seems fair as it is A-OK but not enough to take it to a 4 star."}
{"text":"I didn't expect to find such good Chinese food near my house and with so many vegetarian options! This place has the best fried rice I've had in Calgary so far. I will hopefully be going back more times. All I've been thinking about is the veggie fried rice, it was so good. This place in my opinion is reasonably priced for a good amount of food. The service was good, I loved the homelike vibe this restaurant gave. The food was definitely fresh and very warm. This place has been one of the best places for Chinese food. Will be going back soon :)"}
{"text":"Easily the best Chinese food I've had in yyc. Absolutely love their orange chicken, and their spring rolls are delicious! We love ordering takeout from here and frequently do so.   The only reason why I am not giving five stars is because one time I ordered take out on a busy Friday night and the food did not taste as fresh (perhaps it had been prepared en masse prior to the dinnertime rush). However, besides that, the food has always been VERY good, and the staff are friendly as well. A must try for takeout!"}
{"text":"I think it's very sub par Chinese food. The hot and sour soup was neither hot nor sour. The dumplings are too doughy. The ginger beef was overcooked and you could not really tell that it was beef. It looked more like chicken but didn't taste like either. The beef and broccoli sauce was a bit runny and odd tasting.  The one redeeming item was fried squid which was cooked perfectly and had a really good flavor.  Also I got a glass of water and it was served to me warm like the pitcher was sitting on a hot pad or something. I don't get the appeal."}
