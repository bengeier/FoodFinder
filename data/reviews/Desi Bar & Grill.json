{"text":"The food was good, there's no denying that, but we won't be back because the service was terrible. We waited a long time to have our order taken, our apps were attempted to be served to the wrong table, had to ask for more water after a long wait, we're over charged, and had to ask where the food we asked to be boxed up went. On top of all that, we were using a Groupon, and I called to make a reservation as instructed, but the lady on the phone said not to worry, just come in. When we were seated I said we had a groupon, when I asked for our bill I said I had a groupon, when the bill finally came no groupon was reflected and the guy said we couldn't use it because we didn't have a reservation. Obviously I argued and he allowed us to use it but what an unpleasant experience! We won't be back!"}
{"text":"Ive been to this place several times, food is great only problem ive had with this place is the funk of the waiters...I dont need to smell B.O. when im supposed to be smelling butter chicken. This has been a problem everytime ive been, maybe instead of tips they could get Right Guard? ive stopped going because the last time was really bad and just brings up bad memories."}
{"text":"Amazing food and atmosphere. Must try the butter chicken nachos! Mississauga definitely needed a pace like this.  And you can watch the cricket world cup here too."}
{"text":"The food was good but it wasn't worth the price. The prices are too high and now they included gratuity (tip) in the bill. We always tip very well but after they included the gratuity I didn't feel like tipping more than I than I did before. The cost of the food is not representative of the price as I could have gone to Red Lobsters and got better quality food for the same price."}
{"text":"Amazing food and music is great, dont miss the starters. Daal Makhani one of the best in GTA"}
{"text":"Was recommended this spot by a coworker. So glad that we gave it a try. Grabbed take out from here - butter chicken, rogan gosth and lamb biryani. Loved the butter chicken and lamb biryani. Did not enjoy the rogan gosth. We'll definitely go back to try some more dishes. Ps they are halal too"}
{"text":"Ordered through just-eat.ca on Friday at the dinner hour, and our order arrived in a decent amount of time, 1st time we ordered from this location, as we never heard of this place before, and we really enjoyed the food.  It was packaged well, great presentation, smelled delicious.  Mmmmmm definitely will order again!"}
{"text":"Wanted a place that's open late night on a Monday to catch up with friends. These guys close at 12 and so it was perfect. The food was good. The ambience was excellent and the server was a really good host. Will definitely go back.. would recommend this place to others.."}
{"text":"Got delivery here once. Food was OK,  really nice portions,  very generous. Got two panner curries, some non, and other sides.  Guy who delivered was very nice and the food was hot."}
{"text":"There's no disputing that the food from this place is great. Everything I've tried on the menu has been excellent and I've had everything from veggie pakoras to chicken tikka to paneer palak. All delicious.  Unfortunately the management has decided to stop serving my area via Just Eat and I won't be giving them my business in any form anymore. Not only that but they haven't communicated this properly to Just Eat so they still show up and charges have to be reversed after the fact. Frustrating.  Regardless, if you are interested in some good Indian I would still give my recommendation."}
{"text":"We were there a little early on a Monday night, so not a lot of people there. I was a little worried about that. However, I could not have been more wrong...  I have been to many Indian restaurants, and India many times. This was definitely in the top 5 Indian meals I've ever had...anywhere.  My wife ordered tikka masala (not Indian, I know...but she loves it). I ordered the goat biryani. We also ordered some naan.  Both dishes were absolutely perfectly prepared. The spice content was just what I hoped for. I know a good biryani when I'm picking out whole cloves and cardamom pods. The goat was very mild and falling-off-the-bone tender. A subtle heat that gave me just the slightest nasal drip by the end.  I'm not sure if I'll make it back to the area again, but if I do, I'll definitely stop in again. By far one of my favorite meals in a long time."}
{"text":"Found this place through Yelp. It's an amazing place. Awesome food. The people actually care and help you with the food selection. The food tastes amazing had tandoori chicken, reshmi chicken + the manager suggested we should try their signature Butter chicken Nachos, they were just amazing.. We were a group of 8 and we order 1 drink per person and 3-4 appetizers and 4 veg/non veg dishes along with Naans and Shrimp Biryani. Our bill came up to $220 (with taxes & gratuity included) But we got a 10% discount through Yelp :-). I would for sure visit again this time for Dosas. In all an amazing place..:-)"}
{"text":"We were there last weekend. Ordered chicken wings, tandoori chicken and garlic dosa.  I must say, it was impressive and delicious.  Going there again today with some friends."}
{"text":"FINALLY!! A truly amazing Indian fusion gem in the Square One/Rathburn/Tomken area with great food and impeccable service (privately owned and the partners are always there making sure you have a great experience)  I'll start with the food.... 100% made to order and after 5-7 visits trying everything from traditional Indian to Canadian lounge food I've been impressed! fav's so far are Chili fish, pakoras, Dosa and the chicken wings (best in town)  The atmosphere is solid... totally renovated in Dec. 2012 and with the same space they created two completely different areas, dining and lounge with a killer sound system and multiple flatscreens...  As a 10 year resident of the neighbourhood I would encourage you to check it out... YOU will not be disappointed!!  They actually deliver too which is awesome if you don't want to make the trek!"}
{"text":"A friend and I went to this bar not knowing what to expect. The food was terrific! Our waiter was knowledgeable about the preparation of how the food was made, and, what ingredients was in all the dishes, the waiter made very good recommendations. The service was friendly and the food came in good timing. They had a sports channel on the TV'S, and had a good mix of music playing. Bottom line........ Excellent Indian Cuisine. Reasonably priced. Fast friendly service."}
{"text":"Amazing dosa place in GTA. Better than other popular dosa restaurants in town. Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"I was here on vacation and decided to do delivery in with my family.. We ordered a course of dishes and what great dishes they where.. They were tasty. They also gave a great portion for delivery which really surprised me.."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and a very authentic Dosa are the memories we will take away from here. If you've never had a Dosa, think crepes on steroids filed with yummy Indian dishes such as butter chicken or paneer. Delicious!  The restaurant is in a strip mall and hosts live cultural music on the weekends. The identity is still evolving as they experiment with \"fusion\" dishes such as butter chicken nachos built for the bar crowd, but for a relaxed and super yummy dinner, this place was great."}
{"text":"I still remember the first day i stepped into this place, i was soo warmly greeted by the owners letting them know that i had never tried indian food before. The recommended that i try the butter chicken nachos and let me just say i've never tasted anything so amazing in my life, that's when i knew that indian food was my new favourite food. I have been coming here since this place basically opened and ive tried everything from butter chicken to chilli chicken dry, being a health nut so particular on how food is made and what is in it i LOVE the fact that all of desi's food is made fresh from scratch and isnt just frozen food, its the care put into the food and the friendly service that keeps me coming back i definitely recommend them to everyone even if you dont like spicy foods there is also something on the menu to suit you!"}
{"text":"Amazing food... Fav was butter chicken nachos... Loved the butter chicken too... Must try"}
{"text":"Place had a nice atmosphere, very friendly wait staff.  Food was good,  but everything was extra,  including the rice, which is always included as part of your meal anywhere else."}
{"text":"Randomly searching for Indian food and came across this \"bar & grill\". There have a random bar on one end, which was confusing. I think they should focus on the food and forget the \"bar\". Confusing atmosphere. The food itself was amazing! We got the grill platter and it was delicious. You could taste the smokiness from the Tandoor. Authentic indian food.   The only thing is, it was dead when we went for dinner so hopefully it stands the test of time.   I would eat here again and get the tandoori platter to share! Service was great."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here last minute. Usually I am given time to read reviews and even one poor review can make me turn away. I'm so glad that I wasn't given the time for that. Was service a little slow?? Sure. Did I care? Of course not..... I was there spending time with my boyfriend and we were in no rush.   The food was worth the wait. We ordered the Kadai Chicken and the Chicken Tikka Masala with rice and naan. There is nothing that I can complain about. I loved everything (we shared of course) and was still talking about how great the food was the next day. Please don't visit this place if you're in a rush and are going to let the wait for service cause you to rate the food poorly. Don't visit if you're impatient because the goal is to get some pictures for your Instagram album. The food is fabulous. Just go with someone that you really want to spend time with and don't worry about the wait."}
{"text":"This review is based on delivery and doesn't reflect the atmosphere and service    Pros: Authentic flavored Garlic Jaan Tikka was good and Kadhai Chicken was Dope  Cons : Bone in Tandoori Chicken Quality was poor ...either that or it was previously frozen and you can taste it in the text near the bone"}
{"text":"This is our go to place for any major events or as well just a gathering. I had reviewed them before but considering their consistency in quality and service, I am reviewing again. Food is great and truly authentic Indian taste. Service is top notch always and very friendly staff. This is coming after about 6+ visits on different occasions. They have nice ambience with bar and a big screen along with musical nights on some weekends.   This will be mine and our group of friends go to place whenever we crave Indian food. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I was looking for some fun place to go as it was my B\"dy. Saw some pics of this place.  Was not disappointed.  We were a group of 4.   Got a great service from the start. Good drinks menu. Good music, delicious food. I ordered Vegetarian while the rest orderded Chicken and seafood. The food presentaion is lovely. We did not order any dessert. But they have  nice selections. They served me  a wedge of chocolate cake and played the B'dy song when my guest mentioned the occasion to them...Aww isn't that sweet. Well loved the experience.  Well I will going there often..hope there is dancing.  Thank you D.B&G"}
{"text":"Best Indian food in Mississauga. Their veggie samosas and their butter chicken is to die for . Plus, I love how late they're opened so if you're craving Indian at those guilty/late hours, this is the go-to."}
{"text":"The food although over-priced is quite delicious. The portion sizes are adequate and satiating.  The only issue is the wait time. Our food took an immense amount of time to arrive. The appetizers took ~1 hour to be delivered and the main course arrive 30 minutes after that. This was especially frustrating as there was no one else in the restaurant when we arrived and only 1 other table with a couple got filled in the time that we were there. The customer service is excellent. There was a single server working at the restaurant at the time and he was very helpful and kind."}
{"text":"Not sure why some folks don't seem so happy but the two times I've been here both the food and service have been great!   this is a better looking Indian restaurant. Most Indian places are small dingy and hole in the wall. Absolute desi is relatively new and very clean. The server was kind friendly and accommodating both times. I've had Dosa here on both my visits and it's amazing! Second best to gurulaxami for sure. The sambhar is absolute delicious. We also had the paneer tikka appetizer which  came on a skillet and was surprisingly really good. Tender and large chunks of fresh paneer.   It was a friends bday and they played a birthday song and brought out a free dessert too!   I'd go back to try some of their other menu items for sure."}
{"text":"It's a nice place to hang out and have drinks n food. It's a bar where you get fusion Indian food. Food tastes fresh n delicious, specially the 40 creek whiskey BBQ wings and Tandoori non veg platter. Service is little slow sometimes, but I don't mind that as staff here is polite n friendly."}
{"text":"Bhindi masala was awesome, lacha and green chilli paratha were great....quick and courteous service."}
{"text":"Great place for a drink and some good Indian food. Was visiting Toronto and came upon this gem through Yelp. Enjoyed their Goat/ Chicken biryanis and chicken tikka masala. Good service and ambience to complement the food."}
{"text":"I felt cheated . This is the only restaurant that charges 15% gratuity for 5 people that includes 2 kids under 10 and under 5!!!! Their view is that only kid not counted is the one in stroller or sitting in arms   The food is extremely pricey for the quantity served. The appetizers are very oily. Butter chicken and butter paneer has 4 to 5 small pieces and rest is all gravy. There are much better place to eat to hearts content and not feeling cheated in the end.  I will never visit this place again and don't recommend to anyone else!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love their food ! Butter chicken Nachos, grilled meats, daal .... great food ! I only wish on the weekends they made it more lively with a band or music to dance on ..."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for the dosas for a few years - tastes great. Came in today and saw the menu changed. Also saw new staff members - the girl working was extremely slow, had to wave them down to get my order taken, after that we felt like she was very fake and insincere in the way she talked. Was annoying. Also seemed like they were training a new guy so more emphasis was on training him than getting her job done. Anyways we Ordered the Punjabi Chaheel drink which tasted just like a glass of milk with rose syrup so it was way overpriced for what you get. Dosa was good though as usual.  Also every time I come here they have horribly LOUD music with the bass up very high. It is extremely frustrating having to talk loudly to hear the guests your eating with and the bass just gives us a headache. It's happened Every single time I've eaten here and once it was so bad that I literally had to ask to turn it down.  Lastly, their decor is very dark and strange.   Anyways, I mainly come for the dosas which I recommend but the standard of this restaurant is sadly dwindling."}
{"text":"Lol..this place is a joke, you have to wait until the bar tender comes to get you a table, and then you wait and notice there is no one to take your order. After 15 mins of waiting, when we left the bar tender again comes,back to ask why you are leaving? Ha ha..no wonder this place is deserted and no one goes there. Stay away..."}
{"text":"Kadhai chicken and Dal makhani are as good as it can get.. late night destination helps.. Service can get slow at times but the mouth watering food makes up for it.  Note to the Chef: Dosas used to be very good, they have recently changed in taste for the worse, thats why 4 stars..   Re reviewed to 5 stars cause the manager reached out and was eager to know how the dosas could be improved! Way to go desi bar and grill..   P.S. I have had experiences with places where owners antagonize the bad reviewers"}
{"text":"Wife and I went here hoping to discover a new go to open later in Mississauga.   Takeout was a bit pricey but  I wouldn't have minded if it was even mediocre.  The veg. biryani tasted like dish soap.  We have had veg biryani at countless restaurants and never encountered this.  She threw hers out and I forced it down.  Would have complained and asked for refund if it was closer."}
{"text":"Fantastic place for Dosa! Enjoyed afternoon lunch and was very surprised to find this place. One of the best Sambors, home made chutneys and desserts. Recommend u try the plCe if ur in the area."}
{"text":"We were driving from Niagra falls back to Mississauga - came across this place late night  - we ordered goat biryani which is delicious and easily feeds 2 people, lamb kabobs were great as well as Garlic Naan. Definitely recommend it - 5 stars"}
{"text":"Just WOW! The ambience and the service is awesome. Food was super delicious and Paneer Kadai was a bomb. Garlic naan was super crunchy on outside and soft inside. This is a fusion kinda restaurant which also offer nachos, poutine, momos which we haven't tried yet. The size of the dosa was huge. I would definitely recommend this restaurant. The servers are nice and friendly. They were really attentive and prompt. If you do a check-here on yelp they offer you 10% discount. Isn't that great!? I can't wait to go back there."}
{"text":"Horrible service my throat was so dry had an empty glass of water for a while. Server was hanging outside the restaurant with his friends. Won't go back!"}
{"text":"I order my food here (delivery/takeout) most of the time but let me tell you that their food is amazing! I am in love with their Tikka masala and their Kadai Beef! So good! It just puts me in a good mood afterwards and my family likes it as well!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Superb food! Great service (Meet was our server) and chic ambience! We came with family. We would definitely come again."}
{"text":"Been there twice.  Nice casual place.  Had Bhindi & Goat Masala.  Both were very good.  Will go back.  Next time had the Chilli Masala Dosa.  Dosa was nice and crisp.  The rest was mild and with minimal flavour.  Absolute no South Indian flavours.  Real disappointment.  If someone does not know South Indian flavours it may not matter.  Will go back but will stay away from the Dosas."}
{"text":"This place has been on my radar for a couple of months; however, I had been waiting for a day when my cousin was available to try it out with me. What initially intrigued me about this place was that they had pictures displaying lots of flavoured vodkas (it took me a couple of weeks to put two and two together that the 'Absolut' in their name referred to 'absolut vodka' (duh!) ).  The warm blue glow of the bar makes you feel like your in a trendy downtown nightclub, not a strip mall in suburbia. They also have a seating area adjacent to the bar. Initially, service was lacking. They don't give you any indication whether or not you need to wait to be seated and after not seeing any servers for a five minutes got a dirty look from the bartender when we decided to seat ourselves.  Both my cousin and I tried their 'signature cocktail' being a cucumber cooler. I found it on the stronger side but after a sip or two had no trouble finishing it.   Both my cousin and I also ordered the butter chicken, a bowl of rice and two servings of garlic naan. I found this butter chicken creamy but spicier than I usually enjoy. The portions are big enough for two meals and I had enough left over to cover my dinner the next day.  The bar is covered with televisions and on this particular night we had the option of watching either the hockey game or the food network's \"you gotta eat here\". I must say watching mouth-watering food while in a restaurant sends your mouth mixed messages and in this case had me wanting to dessert my meal in Mississauga and head to Hamilton to try the restaurant being showcased.  All in all: food was a-ok, service was prompt and fast, atmosphere encouraged you to sit and relax (except for wanting to try the restaurants advertised on tv), price point higher than I expected but reasonable considering the amount of food provided in a portion. I would recommend this place to individuals living in the area who are looking for a relaxing night of drinks and dinner; however, if I returned in the future I definitely think I would stick to their Canadian fare."}
{"text":"I've gone to this place for a long time and have never been disappointed. Pakoras are yummy, I always get the garlic naan with any of my faves (butter chicken, aloo Gobi, kadai paneer or shahi paneer. All the dosas are delicious, but if you get it delivered it will be slightly soggy Instead of being crispy. One of my favourite Indian places."}
{"text":"It's a mixed feeling.... Though they are open till midnight, but the kitchen closes at 10:45. The service is excellent. The servers are polite and very attentive and puts their best effort to maintain your satisfaction. But unfortunately the place lacks in cleanliness, almost in all aspects!!  The food is average. We found the nan and paratas too oily.  We had Bhuna lamb, but the meat was not as tender as expected and the flavour wasn't deep infused!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite Indian restaurant. Its not a typical indian atmosphere at this place . Has amazing mouth watering food , my favorite are the butter chicken nachos and butter chicken poutine as these are their signature creations .  The tandoori dishes come on a sizzler  and they are very well done and flavored. They have some really interesting curries like kebab masala , pepper chicken and methi malai paneer.  And last but not the least they make very traditional south indian delicacy dosas with new creations like keema dosa , butter chicken dosa and shrimp dosa . They are very authentic and they take care of the customers just like family as its a family run place .  I have never had a bad experience infact the music makes you back there again and again !!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great place for a get together. Their menu is quiet large with many choices. Dosas were spot on. Meat dishes were well done but could've used a bit more spice. Overall I recommend."}
{"text":"Food was excellent and the service is El rapido!! Great place for a late dinner amd drinks."}
{"text":"Where to start? We went there with a group of friends and there was 5 of us. The 'bar' menu, since it's called 'Bar and Grill' is really mediocre. Even in the very short list of draft beer they had, they were out of many options. No craft beer or any local breweries. On the cocktail side, the drinks were laughable for a place that claims to be a 'bar'. So one our beer glass was broken and they still served the beer in that glass. The cocktails were merely juices with zero oz of alcohol. Very disappointing.   When it comes to food, they forgot to punch in all our order and only brought the dosas. The dosas is really big and hangs on both side of the plate. The dosa are basically broken by the time it comes to you and the food is resting on the table directly. Super grossed out! One of our dosa's was completely burnt and the waiter told us that it was just crispy. Food was not very good either.   The atmosphere is very cheap. The heat was not even on and we had to ask them several time to put the heat on.   Tip: don't go there!"}
{"text":"This is the first Indian restaurant that I have been to that wasn't a buffet, so it already has that going for it.   The food tasted great. I had the naan and vindaloo goat curry. Both of which were fresh and delicious.    There were only two things that bothered me during my visit here: The menu and the music.   The menu is all over the place. So many fonts and themes are happening in that thing to where I just sat there not knowing what I was looking at. There's nothing wrong with the music, it's just extremely loud. So loud that you have a hard time thinking.  These complaints may be valid, or they may be just be because I'm from little old Oklahoma, where everything is uncomplicated and quiet."}
{"text":"My family and I drove into Mississauga pretty late into the evening, and we were looking for something non-chain non-fast food (and non-closed) for dinner. I stumbled upon Desi Bar's Yelp page, and was relieved to see that their kitchen is open until 11 pm, so we headed over.   We walked in, and we were all immediately delighted and refreshed by the modern aesthetic and great Urban Punjabi music selections--the Zack Knight, Mickey Singh, and Imran Khan songs were on point and fit the atmosphere perfectly.   The service from our waitress was amazing; despite the modern vibe, there was a warm, family feel as well courtesy of the staff.   As for the food, wow. I was impressed by their wide variety of unique options on their menu, and I was even more impressed by what we ordered. As for drinks we tried a Cheetah beer, which had green mango flavorings and is brewed in Canada, and we also tried a banta lemonade--I would recommend both. For our meal, we ordered an egg + garlic dosa and a spinach dosa, and also the butter chicken poutine.   All in all, Desi Bar is a unique combination of a modern sports bar and a great spot for quality Desi food that has a Canadian twist, but stays true to its roots. I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from this place thru Skip The Dishes and was very excited, given their high yelp rating. 1 hour and 15 minutes later, my food arrived cold and in a giant mess. The curry spilled inside the bag and was on everything.  Granted, I don't know if the delivery person was responsible for this, but in any case, they should invest in better take out containers. The use of styrofoam should be completely eliminated by the restaurant industry...my humble opinion.   I ordered :  1 Vegetable Samosas  1 Tandoori Chicken (small)  1 Roganjosh (goat)  1 Plain Basmati Rice  1 Plain Naan  The samosas where made with Phyllo dough and the only vegetable I could see was potato. Potato everywhere, as far as the eye can see. The green chutney it came with tasted good, but it was an unnatural shade of neon green, I suspect food colouring was involved .  The chicken was undercooked, who serves undercooked chicken??? It's the easiest thing to cook, how can you get it so wrong??? The roganjosh was another disappointment, there were only 4 tinny pieces of meat with bone, FOUR! so the meat was swimming in sauce, lots of sauce.   The rice would've been nice were it not for the excessive use of anise seeds and all other kinds of spices. I mean you could not take a bite of the rice without chewing something unpleasant. It became a chore, dig and scoop out all the seeds and giant pieces of cinnamon bark.   In the end, the naan was the highlight of the meal.   To the cooks of this joint: get your s@&* together!  To the future guests: don't expect authentic Indian cuisine, in fact skip the entire Indian food section of the menu."}
{"text":"Place was good with eye catchy decors ! V had some naan breads, gravies and biryani ..!  The gravies and biryanis lack flavour and there are very few staffs so leading to a lot of waiting time for everything !"}
{"text":"Great to start with perfect beer from tap and hariyali chicken tikka... loved food and presentation. Nice Indian music with mix tadka!!!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here for dinner and the place was practically empty. The staff was very friendly/accommodating, seating was nice, and the music gave a great vibe to our night. They had a great variety on their menu, in which we had a hard time choosing and got some assistance from the waitress. The food was served hot, fresh and full of  flavour! Only downfall was the time it took for the food to come out with the small amount of people present. Nonetheless we will be returning to try out more on the menu!!"}
{"text":"Wow.. not only is the food Impeccable but the customer service over the phone is good. I find indian restaurants over the phone, when they speak to non Indians they come across as uninterested or dull, it's either simple or they just don't care.. sometimes even oddly rude.. Not with these people.. they really know what they are doing. I called after 10pm and the lady said because it is late, I have to do a minimum order of $50. I said okay, why not? I Love Indian food and that gives me a chance to try more items, and I'll have Left Overs! Even though I hate left overs.. (I don't find it fresh, I prefer fresh food).. Indian food sometimes taste way better the next day then other dish. So I said I'm in! She was extremely kind, I was indecisive because I Love both butter chicken and Tikka Chicken Masala.. she recommended I go with the Tikka because more flavorful, I took it, I also got Lamb Briyani and garlic Naan with Extra Ghee and Chili Fish! Omg.. Everything was soooo soooo good and it was my first time trying them. Best believe I am going to be Loyal to this one. Oh yeah. I had a party in my mouth, I was in Foodie Heaven. If you like indian food give this place a try. I highly highly recommend. Imagine.. if they can make all those items taste so good, I'm definitely interested to take the risk and try other things off the menu, the delivery came fast too. I forgot to mention I also got a Mango Lassie and it was very tasty and sweet and mangoey! Just how I like it.. they have a Mango Smoothie on the menu, next time I order I will get that one instead.. yes I know I stated the Mango Lassi was good but I can tell they use A lot of yogurt because it was very thick.. I'm sure the Smoothie will taste the same, just more like a drink/Smoothie which I do prefer, besides that, they deserve 5 stars. Smiley face."}
{"text":"I want to go back ASAP!! This place went beyond my expectations. Most indian restaurants that from their appearance seem pretty pretentious and try to attract the upscale crowd tend to fail in their food quantity and taste, as they try to please those that cannot handle spicy indian flavors. But this place, despite being a tad on the pricey side, did not compromise on the food portions and flavors at all.  The service was good and attentive, although that could have been because the restaurant was not very busy at that time.  This restaurant is very unique as it's a hybrid of an indian restaurant and a Canadian bar and grill, as they also serve non-indian appetizers such as nachos and poutine.  I liked that their menu was quite limited, with just a few options for each category. This ensures me that the chefs would focus on each recipe rather than mixing any pre-made sauces together to make a curry. They also had a small dosa section with unique options such as butter chicken dosa.  We started off with ordering the paneer tikka as an appetizer, which was surprisingly quite expensive but I had the craving so couldn't pass on it. For the mains we got the garlic masala dosa and the shahi paneer with garlic naan. The food did take time to arrive, which shows that it was being made fresh, so I had no problem (as long as they don't take more than 20 minutes). My one complaint was that the mains came before the appetizer. The server did apologize for that. But damn...that paneer tikka was the bomb!! My brother and I went kind of speechless for a minute after our first bite. Then I nervously took my first bite into my (gigantic) dosa, since I haven't had good luck with dosas recently except for when I'm at guru Lukshmi. To my surprise the dosa was as good as Guru Lukshmi's! The shahi paneer was amazing too and the portion size was large enough that we had to pack some of it up.  I'm not sure how the service would be if the place is filled up, but the taste of the food would definitely compensate for it if it were bad.  This is for sure now on my list of one of my favorite indian restaurants, and fortunately for me it's not too far from me. I really hope they keep this up."}
{"text":"Indian sports bar?  I have never heard of this before!  I felt like I was inside Jack Astros with An Indian twist. This place rocked!  Awesome Indian dance music, tv's, comfy booths, amazing service and wicked food! There was a dance floor and projectors and lights in the back of the restaurant which I saw on Yelp the place turns into a club? This place looked like everyone was just having a good time! Tones of large family groups and friends were just hanging out and drinking. There's a huge bar people we're relaxin at.  The only thing I'd change is that they should let you decide how mild or spicy you want the food to be. We ordered Garlic Nan, Goat Biriani, Chicken Tika, Veggie Pakora and rice and it was delicious my boyfriend loved it and so did my Mom - I brought her home left overs!  The portions are huge !!  For a late night drink and dinner this place is great!"}
{"text":"Very satisfying Indian meal. You can have your beer with chilli chicken and then top it with a masala dosa! That's my recommendation to go about it. Shout out to Ravi for attentive and warm service!"}
{"text":"First time to try this place, they have different taste of the food. But the price for the food is outrage.  I think is not worth to spend that much money to regular food."}
{"text":"Amazing staff great vibe love the hours and food is phenomenally delicious...! Love the guys memory..."}
{"text":"I am so glad that I found this restaurant/bar. It is an excellent combination of East meets West. I was craving some good Indian food but also wanted to have a nice cocktail and that's not something g you can find at most Indian restaurants, but here they have a lot of selection and the drinks were really well made. The food was amazing and left me wanting more. I swear I'd try everything if I could. Also the service was great and our server made us feel welcome and relaxed  I'm excited to return and maybe even check out one of the dj or live music events."}
{"text":"For all you cry babies shut up the place, food and service was very good some people complain too much when I read others review I didn't want to go but I'm happy I checked out for myself this place is way better then Avani and that got better review I wonder how? must be a inside job"}
{"text":"Great service. Variety of options on the menu including dosa, vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. I ordered Dal Makhani and Palak Paneer with naan. It was quite tasty and spicy - just how I like it!"}
