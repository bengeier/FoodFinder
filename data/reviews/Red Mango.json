{"text":"Food was good....well the food that did come
My dad made a large ordered which included 3 orders of Cantonese chow men 
EVERYTHING Expect the chow neon came
And when my dad called and explained the situation the man working there played stupid and said \"oh it's in the bag it's in the bag\"

It was not.
So they scammed my dad out of $25
Will not be ordering again."}
{"text":"Mistake going there.  Certainly not a place one would go because of the decor.  Outdated and uncomfortable with blaring television.  Tried a couple of  Thai dishes.  I have never had coconut milk so thin.... more like coconut water.  The worst part is when I got the bill, I realized they charged me for the Chinese tea.  You know the cheap stuff they give you in any Chinese restaurant for free while you are waiting.  No great deal either.  When I told her I wasn't coming back because she was charging me for the tea, she didn't seem to care they were losing a potential customer.

Please don't go here. You will be so disappointed. Try Thai One On ... it's just a few hundred meters away, across York Mills."}
{"text":"Great service and the food was good. Standard Chinese/Asian. Exactly what we were expecting. Will definitely order again."}
{"text":"We were sooooo hungry so we ordered lots of foods! Egg rolls, beef with black bean sauce, wonton soup, shrimp lo mein, moo shoo pork and kung pou chicken! Whew. that was a mouthful of orders indeed. Everything was delicious. Kung pou chicken and the noodles were especially good. Moo shoo pork left a bit to be desired but it was still solid. But the real gold was beef with black bean sauce. It was different from what I tasted at other restaurants. It had authentic taste. 

We also wanted to order some foods from Thai menu but we were not familiar with the cuisine so we only covered Chinese section. They do takeouts too. 

The restaurant is clean, and server was friendly. Foods came out so quick too. 

We will be coming back here often as our neighbourhood lacks decent Chinese restaurants, and this really hit the mark for us!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here a number of times, both sit-down dining and the occasional take-out as well. I especially recommend the mango chicken, general Tao chicken, and basil beef.

Staff are also friendly and courteous, asking their clients (for example) whether they were affected by the ice storm. 

Price-wise, I have found it quite reasonable, with lunch ranging from $6-$9 from the hot table and the more expensive option being enough for 1.5 meals."}
{"text":"Delivery is free after $18, a perfectly reasonable price point to reach when ordering in for two.  Although last night, the hubs was hungry - so we ordered a Thai dinner meal for 3!

I think it was $35 before taxes and tips, and we got: 

- 1 rice: If you're a rice fiend you'll find this to be only enough for 2 filled-to-the-top Chinese rice bowls.

- 2 large containers of lemon chicken soup: Filled to 1 + 1 1/2 plastic containers; I found the chicken dry but fished them out and doused them in curry later & made it much better!  The soup was the most flavourful item for the night.

- 1 Pad Thai: Eh, it's OK, seems to have a fake orangey-red colouring but tastes alright.  Cut up a lime and squeeze it on if you've got any at home, because it's not provided in the box.

- 1 Red Shrimp Curry: If you read their online takeout menu, you can basically choose two dishes of your choice, but only one of them may include seafood.  It's OK.  

- 1 Basil Beef:  Beef could be more tender and it could use more basil, but meh.

There aren't many delivery/takeout places that I can think of in the North York/Willowdale area, so I'd probably order from here again occasionally.

All in all: meh."}
{"text":"Small little hidden place with good flaovours. 
Came here for dinner and was surprised with the quality of food and the flavor of the food. 
Not too expensive and good portion sizes 
All in all good place"}
{"text":"The one item I keep buying from this place is their General Tao chicken.  Delish!  I've tried their chilli chicken too, and its OK, but I keep coming back for the General Tao.  Highly recommended for this!

It's a bit pricey tho.  For one seving (no rice) costs $10.25 tax incl.  Should be less in my opinion.

{"text":"I just ordered here for the first time - ordered Lemon Chicken, stir fried broccoli, vegetable spring rolls and chicken spring rolls. Everything was great except the batter on the chicken was almost falling off (could have been cooked an extra minute or so). Was still tasty though. I like that they put the lemon sauce separate so you can add as much as you want. 

They have free delivery with an order of $20 or more so it was a good deal. There's at least enough food for 2 meals, if not 3. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great lunch selections. I especially like the spicy chicken wing. Price is reasonable for the amount of food they pack into your box. Has seating area that's good for a quick bite during your lunch break.

I've only tried their dinner take out few times. I really like their chilli chicken and pai thai. You can also choose to sit there to eat which I've seem some ppl do. 

Overall, a decent chinese/thai restaurant that's kinda in a hole in the wall place (but sometimes those are the best kind) haha. Worth a try."}
{"text":"This used to be a Thai restaurant now it is a Thai and Chinese restaurant. This is just like any other Canadian-Chinese take out place, the first time I ordered seemed to taste better but that could have been because I was quite hungry. The prices are reasonable and the food is average, I have only tried the Chinese food and may give the Thai a go ..."}
{"text":"Quite tasty Chinese-Canadian (not authentic Chinese) delivery with very good fried rice.  Very pleasant service but delivery people could be a bit more adept at directions.  Extremely reasonable prices.  They also have some Thai and West Indian-Chinese dishes."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly service. I ordered a family of 4 special and we don't eat pork, so I asked if it would be ok to substitute for more chicken balls and they had no problem. (Extra $3 charge) and we don't eat the chop suey and we asked if we could substitute for more rice or something and again they were ok with giving more rice for the substitution  :)  chicken wings are soooo delish. Highly recommend this place. Oh and the Free delivery over $18 order, that's a plus :)"}
