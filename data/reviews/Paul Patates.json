{"text":"I've been to Paul Patates of course after seeing it on Taxi 0-22.. The food was good, I've had better. And there is one major problem. It is wayyy overpriced!! I don't know how the owner(s) can sleep well at night charging 4.85$ for a small poutine and 3.25$ for a michigan..  come on guys.. We'll go somewhere else next time.."}
{"text":"Great cantine. I only had poutine and spice beer so I can speak for the rest of their menu. The poutine met my criteria (good gravy, plenty o' cheese, food fries). i was slightly worried thinking the gravy was going to be the dark one (from photos posted) but it wasn't - to my delight. The service was very good and the order was in front of me in less than a minute. Great!"}
{"text":"Mes frites étaient délicieuses. Mon cheeseburger aussi. J'y retour sans faute si je repasse dans le Coin"}
{"text":"Paul Patates semble à première vue un petit fast-food de quartier ordinaire et ces hamburgers, ses hot-dogs et ses frites n'ont rien d'extra-ordinaire. Cependant, au cas où vous ne le sauriez pas, ce restaurant a été adopté comme lieu de tournage de la populaire émission de TVA Taxi 0-22 mettant en vedette Patrick Huard. Je dois avouer que ça me laisse indifférent et que ce n'est pas ce qui explique mon affection pour l'endroit. En fait, Paul Patates propose sa propose sa propre bière d'épinette, la Bertrand, qui est brassée sur place. Cette bière d'épinette traditionnelle, dont effervescence est issue du processus de fermentation, est excellente. Et elle rehausse le goût des hot-dogs, qui ne sont pas mal non plus."}
{"text":"Paul Patates est une véritable institution de Pointe-St-Charles et vaut vraiment une visite si vous êtes dans le coin. Un beau petit diner au look d'autrefois, on y trouve une des meilleures poutines du Sud-Ouest et la MEILLEURE bière d'épinette en ville!   Mais, n'essayez pas d'y aller en lendemain de veille le dimanche... Ils sont fermés :("}
{"text":"In a world of over-polished poutine chains the old school, casse croute family holdouts own my soul. Keep your crazy hours, Paul Patate, just also keep your perfect fries, your best in the land homemade biere d'epinette, your funny friendly quick on the draw staff, and all the proud history of your time in Pointe St Charles papering the walls.  Personally, the poutine gravy here isn't my absolute favourite, but maybe it's made to balance perfectly with the white vinegar in squeeze bottles on every table. Because get that all over a Paul Patates poutine then try to tell me you are not in pure poutine heaven."}
{"text":"One of the best place to eat hot dogs, poutine and fries in Montreal. They also do homemade spruce beer who apparently is very good. I personally didn't liked it but it was the first time I had one.  If you want really good poutine, forget all theses fancy places and go there, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Super place. Loved the 1950s diner feel. The poutine was old fashioned - simple. Tasty curds and fresh fries. Also enjoyed their homemade pine beer.   A great stop after hiring  Bixi bike and pedaling along Lachine Canal. Their is a Bixi station right around the corner. Well worth the effort"}
{"text":"So good! Came here and grabbed a classic poutine and spiced beer to go. It's your old school neighbourhood diner without any frills. The poutine was not overly salty and fries were freshly fried on the spot. Spiced beer was the perfect accompaniment. Servers were very nice. Will be back next time we're in the area."}
{"text":"After enjoying the spruce soda made at Paul Patates, I was very hopefully to visit the place for a fresh soda and a meal. Unfortunately, the restaurant was closed more than hour before it is supposed to close and I did not get to enter even though I arrived well within the time frame that the business advertises its open hours."}
{"text":"Pauley Potato is moderately famous for being the scene of a television show, but I want to talk about their Spruce Beer. The clear, non-alcoholic soda in it's own labeled bottles smells atrocious, and tastes moderately good. It's an experience, and probably worth the trip. The poutine is passable (is there any bad poutine, really?), and other items are not necessarily greasy spoon, but definitely a Montreal that Americans don't go. That's cool. I think there was a picture of Celine Dion in there."}
{"text":"Seriously excellent toastés and choice fries (what do you expect from a guy named \"Paul Patates\"?) in a classically kétaine diner setting (\"depuis 1958\"), and you can wash them both down with a legendary Bertrand spruce beer (\"since 1898\").  Try the spruce beer float (a true Montreal classic) when the weather's fine."}
{"text":"Solid \"petit patate\" In Saint Charles. Accepts debit. Has AC.   Stopped in for lunch on a weekday. Pretty crowded with locals, but not so much so that there was a wait. Zero tourists.  Fast service, was in and out easily in under an hour  We got Poutine and boiled hot dogs, but many around us had ordered sandwiches rich with mayo and piled high with chicken and good classic white bread and they looked GREAT.  Frankly, for all the above, I would happily rank this casse croûte far above many of the crowded touristy plateau places."}
