{"text":"Great service from Ashley !! Food was awesome! The wings were huge & I cant wait to eat my beignets w Carmel sauce. I hope they make it home !!!"}
{"text":"I brought my daughter (26) and granddaughter (2) here early for dinner.  Amazing food and terrific service!   From the moment we walked in until we left, every server was attentive and the food was wonderful.  The corn queso... the best, and the ribeye steak - just get it!  We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Was hoping for a lot more. The food was mediocre and way over priced. Almost the entire menu was ala carte.   Didn't expect to pay 50.00 for a light evening meal (with tip).  Don't think we will be returning there."}
{"text":"Very casual, service was good, a real bartender that makes drinks from scratch not mixes.  This is real on site cooked food, it's not a chain restaurant so your not going to get a rack of steamed microwaved ribs for 12 bucks, prices are fair for quality food. if you don't care for low country type food there are enough options. Shrimp and grits were some of the best I've had including in the real low country"}
{"text":"The flavors, price, and food quality are well-balanced, so I have made this place a regular dinner spot.  The cocktails are also cheap and delicious, so it might become a regular drink spot too.   I travel a lot for work, and one benefit is exposure to good food. When I return to my hometown I always feel like local options are limited, so I am happy to find a restaurant that is not a chain and/or does not have microwaved meals. The service is good, and I like the casual atmosphere.   Though I like to try new menu items, I have become partial to the fried green tomatoes, shrimp po boy, and old fashioned."}
{"text":"Came here with a large group. Unfortunately the place was empty because that means people don't know what they're missing. Nestled in an unassuming venue is a hidden gem. If you like food that will warm your belly and soul, you will find this place an unexpected delight.  Only hesitation to a glowing review, the food has some heat amd it was a bit too spicy for some diners; and the beignets were decent, but the warm caramel sauce should be sold by the gallon and eaten  warm as a caramely pecan soup over vanilla ice cream."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Service is great, chef David is a great chef.  My husband had the glazed salmon, very tasty.  I had the Greek pizza, no meat, but really good. We've been there 3 times in the last month. I highly recommend it. You have to try the bacon wrapped jalepenos. Cozy sitting by the fireplace on a winter's evening. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We definitely went at a bad time. We made a reservation for 5 and finally got seated at 6. Didn't see a server until 615 and didn't get food until 8. Corn queso was awesome and food was fantastic. But we didn't leave the restaurant until almost 9."}
