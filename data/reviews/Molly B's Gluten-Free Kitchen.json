{"text":"I had an approximately 30 second conversation in person with the owner, inquiring if they bake any cakes or have cakes for sale.  The owner was so rude when she spoke to me, informing me that they do not do cakes, that I was taken back by her rudeness.  Because of this negative interaction and as I've seen other comments from people regarding the same thing, I will choose to buy my gluten free products elsewhere."}
{"text":"Good food, but keep in mind that this is NOT a restaurant. No inside dining options. It's more of a warehouse for stocking up on GF breads/desserts/bagels etc. for home. Also, the sign on the outside says \"Nate's Bagels\", not \"Molly B's...\"."}
{"text":"Excellent Gluten Free Heaven!!

I have been to gluten free bakeries across canada and I have to say this place is the best! 

It's just a small shop in an industrial plaza but the items are delicious. 

The owner let me try different breads like an onion bread and a pumpernickel bread and both are just as good if not better then any bread you will ever try. 

Prices are reasonable however you get a far superior product then any other brand you've tried! 

Call before if you want specific products because they make them fresh all the time. 

The pizza crust and the breads DO NOT CRUMBLE!!!! 

The lady should me the pizza crust and bent it over and over again and it didn't break, now that's extremely difficult for Gluten Free products, especially Gluten Free bread. 

Try a few products and you will be back!

It's worth the drive to Nates!"}
