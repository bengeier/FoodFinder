{"text":"Just ordered pizza delivery and garlic bread, and truly one of the worst I have ever had. 
Why would you put all the toppings UNDER the cheese, it's common sense and makes the dough soggy and all the cheese slides off. 
Had absolutely no flavor, the cardboard box I think would taste better.
And the garlic bread.... looked like a hot dog bun with butter, sad! And no garlic at all.
$30 down the drain."}
{"text":"I stayed at the hotel near Caffe & Cucina, and it seemed like a clean, homey place.  It has a euro cafe feel with the modern interior and tables outside (on a main street mind you).  They also have a fireplace in the back to make it cozy.

The first time I went, it was pretty good.  I ordered a Caesar salad and pizza.  The salad was absolutely drenched in dressing (which was bland and off-tasting at the same time).  The pizza was pretty good, although for a $14 personal size pizza, the toppings were quite skimpy.  However, it was pretty tasty and cheesy.  The crust was thick and crusty...I happen to like that.  The portions were pretty large, and I had enough for a second meal.

I liked it enough that I went a second time.  I figured since it was my last day there, I'd stick with what I knew.  I got there around 11 AM, and I ordered the pizza with pepperoni instead of sausage this time.  This time, they were totally unprepared for lunch.  My table was dirty, and they actually served toast instead of dinner bread.  The pizza took 30 minutes, and the pepperoni and crust were still undercooked.  I only ate maybe 2 slices and left the rest.  I was so disappointed.

It seems like a convenient, OK place for locals to grab a quick lunch, but that's all of the potential I see for this place.  They are spotty with the food quality and service.  I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"A friend and I ate here today. After ordering we waited over 30 minutes before we got our juice, our meals took a little while longer. There are a number of other cute places around here. If you want a quick, cheap and filling breakfast don't go here. I don't recommend it."}
{"text":"Verry friendly and always busy place.

Went there for breakfast twice (saturday and sunday) with my husband, my son and my daughter. 
My son had a nutella banana and strawberry home made waffle, i had a bite of it: amazing. 

Sarah, my youngest, had a ham & swiss cheese omelette, very good and tasty as well.

My husband and I had the 2 eggs formula, it came with bread, potatoes & Fresh fruits.

While we waited on the sunny terasse for our breakfast, we all shared some freshly made croissants , my husband got a cappucino and i got a latte, my kids had some freshly squeezed orange juice: delicious.
After breakfast, Nathalie, or as my daughter says \"nana\", our server, and her mother Mona also helped my kids to chose their gelato ice cream and they also offered us some little chocolates.
We will definetely be back to this nice family run restaurant."}
{"text":"This restaurant is next to the hotel where I was staying.  Even though the Yelp reviews were mostly unfavorable, I went against my fellow yelpers and ordered what I thought would be a safe/no brainer dish - Veggie Spaghetti. 

Dang..... I don't know what the heck went wrong but it had a horrible \"off\" taste and I couldn't eat it.  If I hadn't already changed into my comfy clothes kicked back ready to eat, chill and watch tv, I would have taken back the Spaghetti in it's entirety. Dang, it was BAD !  The salad was good, so that was my dinner.  I would NOT go back here.   Minus Stars for the Veggie Spaghetti, 2 starts for the Salad."}
{"text":"I've been twice for lunch recently and ate pizza and it was good, the service excellent. There are much worst place to eat in Montreal and I can't understand the other raters comments... Anyway, who'd have mussels in an Italian restaurant? Go to L'Actuel or La Moulerie!"}
{"text":"Waffle was dry and out of ready mix box. Asked for orange juice and got pineapple-orange juice mix. 

The salmon omelette was terrible , no effort to make it taste or look special. 

It is such a downer to go there , no energy whatsoever"}
{"text":"Excellent crepes. Good and friendly service. Very nice presentation. A true French themed cafe. Music selection is excellent as well. Too bad they open late."}
{"text":"We were walking down Sherbrooke trying to find a place to eat. Since Benelux Brewpub (www.yelp.ca/biz/benelux-brewpub-montreal) was completely full, we fell upon Caffe & Cucina at the corner of Avenue Du Parc and Sherbrooke O. 

They were advertising a \"speçial\" with a dozen different types of mussel dishes with frites or a salad. I ordered the beer and bacon mussels and my coworker ordered the white wine mussels, both with fries. I wish I would have gone with the salad and some pasta instead...

First, the \"frites\" were a tiny bowl of McCain frozen shoestring fries. The mussels, however, were served in a large portion. Although our waiter assured us \"the best mussels in Montreal\" they were rubbery and mediocre at best. The sauce was surprisingly quite flavourless. Although my coworker finsihed his bowl (he's Belgian and they love their mussels) I barely finished half of it.

They also had a wide selection of shitty Molson beers on tap and bottle.

In the end the bill came to $40 for two bowls of shitty mussles and frozen McCain fries. I've definately had better. If you want good mussels in Montreal, go to A l'aventure instead (www.yelp.ca/biz/restaurant-a-laventure-montreal)."}
{"text":"Out of respect, please do not go to this restaurant. At the end of our meal when we were paying, the waitress attempted to inform me that we would have gotten better service for whatever reason....before I cut her off and asked her what in the heck she was talking about. She told me I was shaking my head at her, whereas in actuality I was shaking my head at my husband who was helping us determine how we could get back to Los Angeles for my Dad's Hospice we just learned of.  And get this, she then belabored her point to my running out in tears.

This was after another patron was complaining that his son's waffle was too hard, and I thought he sounded like an idiot, because they are made that way in Montreal."}
{"text":"My family and I are staying at the Hilton next door, so when we yelped this place and saw the great reviews, we thought we hit the jackpot. This was far from that. 

We had breakfast yesterday, and the food was mediocre at best. The service was completely horrible. We waited about 8 minutes before someone even talked to us to take our order. While we waited, we looked around and the food didn't even look fresh in the display cases. The gelato had a cold glaze on top, with chunks of different flavors mixed on top of each flavor. There were cookies in a plastic case that had the label obviously ripped off. 

Anyway, we ordered veggie omelets that were brown and over-cooked. They only had mozzarella cheese, which was a glob. The crepe was gross. It was filled with Nutella and huge chunks of cold fruit. The crepe itself was thick and chewy and cold. Not at all what I wanted or expected. The home fries were pretty good. So we all ate those.

I just went back there because I had a serious craving. Again, we were greeted by rudeness. We asked to sample some of their   gelato, and we were told \"Buy it, and if you like it, good. If not... (shrug).\"

Well, we didn't buy, and if you're looking for good service, you won't either. I wish we had a better experience. The other places in the area were wonderful."}
{"text":"Pretty awesome selection of moules and frites for about $14 (CA).  My husband and I love mussels and we ordered the tomato, basil, and garlic flavored and the beer, bacon, and white wine flavored.  We devoured our entire meal and each had the blond Molson beer which paired nicely with our meal.  

I'm not sure about Steeven L.'s review but I don't know of any other place that has 10 different flavors of moules for you to choose from.

We were seated promptly when we entered the restaurant and there was a choice of outdoor or indoor dining.  Service was great and the wait staff came to check on us quite frequently.

We enjoyed our meal here and would come back again."}
{"text":"As a student I like to stroll into random cafés with friends to hit the books and study. When we entered Cucina we greeted with a warm smile and felt welcome. The coffees that we ordered were alright but were presented very well.

What made me enjoy this experience was the ambience; cozy place in the best possible location."}
{"text":"I wanted to give 0 stars, but I can't .The tables wasn't cleaned, the menu was taped together and the place mats had a weird smell too it.  But that was fine if my food came out clean. I ordered the mussels and it was not cleaned properly. Mussels strings, crap and gunk was on the mussels and if you want freshest seafood from the ocean/ sea you can eat here. But what made this experience a 0 star was when I told the waitress my complaint, the manager came out and said \"how do you clean the mussels at home? The mussels came like that and showed me uncooked dirty  mussels from the sea \"as in all mussels should be dirty. 

PS do not order calamari, pizza and spaghetti duo and garlic bread. 

Only acceptable was the poutine fries and the decor on the walls."}
{"text":"Waaait how's cucina only 2 and a half stars on Yelp this has to be changed. I live in a student residence 100m away from this & honestly would never survived my first semester of uni without their spinach omelette which I probably have ordered only like 100times. staff there are amazing, just seeing the ladies' smile makes my day and sometimes you'll get a bunch of free snacks for no reason"}
{"text":"First time here. Coworkers and I are staying in the Hilton Garden Inn right next door, and we wanted some crepes. After learning that Crepes 2 Go was closed for the day, we went ahead and opted for Caffe & Cucina. 

It's a nice place, and we were greeted promptly right when we step foot inside. Since we just wanted to-go, we reviewed the menu near the front. Looking around, Caffe & Cucina offers a wide variety of food options, ranging from pizzas to pasta, mussells as mentioned in other reviews. There are also varieties of desserts, such as cakes and gelato. 

They provided a breakfast menu as well, even when we went in the evening around 6:30pm. There is where we saw omelettes, crepes, and waffles. 

I chose the strawberry, banana, and custard crepes, while my coworker selected the banana and chocolate crepe. I also got a chocolate mocha coffee, while my coworker chose a salad to go along with her crepes. 

We waited outside in the cool evening on their outdoor patio. Customers are offered a choice of sitting inside or outside, both of which are pretty nice.

The crepe was pretty good. Banana was tasty, strawberry was great, the custard was interesting, but overall I enjoyed it. Coffee wasn't too bad either. Overall, I think this place is not too bad for a quick bite. My crepe was 9.95, which is one of two highest priced crepes out of all crepes on the menu. the cheapest was 5.95 I believe for a plain one (or could be just 5.00). 

For the two of us, our total came out to be 33.00, just to give readers a range of prices. While looking at the menu, I did note that other dinner items were 16.00 to 17.00. 

Overall, not too bad for a quick bite, but I wouldn't suggest it for a nice fancy meal. Could be relaxing to just eat something and sit outside."}
{"text":"Latte and gelato were great.  Went 3 times in one weekend. Great friendly service."}
{"text":"My family and I are vacationing in Montreal, and we stopped by this place to get ice cream and coffee. First, we asked for samples of the ice cream, and the employee said she didn't have anymore of those small ice cream spoons. So we just ordered the traditional flavors of vanilla and chocolate. Then she gave us those small ice cream spoons, which she initially claimed were all gone. So after paying for our ice cream and coffees, we decide to sit at the patio. As we're eating I went back inside to ask for napkins, because we didn't have any (sounds logical), but she's starting to build up a slight attitude as if I'm asking for too much. But I just go back to the patio with the napkins. Then I decide to share some ice cream so I go back inside and ask for extra spoons. That's when she gives me a sigh without even trying to disguise it! So right then I decided I have to write a negative review of the place. Most horrible service I've received so far in Canada. Stay away and spend your American dollars at a more welcoming place. (You won't be missing out really because the taste is just ordinary)."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing! The menu has everything you could dream of, and much more! It has every single style of food, even though it says Italian. Great for kids... there's at least 10 different types of pizza. The workers and employees are the kindest people you could meet, and they care a lot about you. The salads are beautifully dressed and the soups are perfect. You could come here for breakfast, lunch, or dinner! And I forgot to mention that you can even come here for dessert, thanks to the lovely gelato flavors. I love this place so very much!"}
{"text":"This is a cute family run restaurant that I've been to on numerous occasions. The hosts have always been welcoming and the service and food have always been great! I've tried their pizza, pasta, muscles and french fries as well as their cakes and gelato, none of which have been a disappointment. Highly recommended if you're looking for a great tasting meal with a home-y vibe."}
{"text":"Sadly my pasta was very undercooked and the sauce did not taste freshly made. It reminded me of the sauce you but in a supermarket. The price was too high for the quality. Some other things that troubled me: the washroom soap dispenser had such a watered down liquid soap in the dispenser that I could not wash my hands. This is usually an indication of a restaurant trying to cut some corners to save money. That combined with the poor quality of food, slow table cleanup service and empty paper towel dispensers in the washroom gave me a bad impression of this restaurant."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place when in town with my family for a college tour of McGill. Did not disappoint. Food was fast, fresh, and reasonable. Lots to choose from. Breakfast all day. The carrot soup was excellent and unexpected. Not busy at all when we were there, but I noticed they also had a full bar and dinner menu."}
{"text":"Great pesto chicken sandwich and the white chocolate brownie explosion cake was one of the best cakes I have ever had!  I would highly recommend this, especially for dessert!"}
{"text":"I've visited this restaurant on several occasions this year for lunch, dessert and dinner, and I've been satisfied every time. I'm not sure if they've changed management or cooks since the bad reviews were written, but the food tasted good and in normal portions. However the slightly high price remains on some items compared to other close-by alternatives. 

What I enjoy the most about this place is the ambiance, both indoors and on the terrace. The manager is very friendly, completely bilingual, and will accommodate dish changes, make recommendations, and check on your table often. Even though it's on a main intersection, once you step inside it's quiet and you can easily talk and enjoy your meal. One time I went with a large group and the staff was very friendly and attentive, speaking French, English and even a little Spanish.

One negative that has happened on two visits is that the waitresses forget your drink order. You have to remind them or ask them to cancel it so it doesn't come in the bill.

Overall it's a place I would recommend and go back to often, and my friends seem to agree."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this cafe while wandering around McGill's campus, and it seemed like a lovely quirky gem. The hostess/waitress was incredibly friendly and helpful, even offering us complimentary drinks when we were having trouble choosing. The carbonara was delicious, and the service - which moved at the relaxed pace typical of a European family-owned bistro in mid-afternoon (as we expected) - was delightful!"}
{"text":"Mauvais et hors de prix. Pour le petit déjeuner, très quelconque, le bacon est en sus. Pas de formules qui incluent les viandes habituelles. Les pâtes?  Médiocres!  Service désorganisé. 12$ pour un oeuf, deux tranches de bacon et un jus d'orange. Sans hôtels à proximité,  cette cucina serait fermée depuis belle lurette!"}
{"text":"There have been some mixed reviews for this place and I was super hesitant to come here and after reading the reviews and seeing the ratings. My sister and her boyfriend had come here and really wanted to come back and on the last day that we in Montreal we decided to come here.

I'm so glad I did because I had a great experience! They had a great variety of food from breakfast to lunch/dinner options. Since I was in Montreal I tried to eat as many crepes as possible, because it was everywhere and I love crepes. The ones here were so good and so was the vanilla latte that I had to order two lattes.

The portion size is generous imo and everything tasted fresh and delicious. Our server was attentive and checked in regularly.

Don't let the reviews and Yelp rating deter you from coming here, it was worth coming here!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast. The 2 eggs with bacon/fruits/toast, plus one fresh orange juice, made my day full of energy."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast, eggs beni and crepes. Fresh squeezed OJ. Clean, good service, good food. What else do you need? Highly recommended."}
