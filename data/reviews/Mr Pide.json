{"text":"I loved their Lahmacun!!! It was spot on and I felt like I am in the middle of Istanbul having an authentic food. The place is very clean the waiter is super nice and there is space in dine in. The portions are huge for the money you pay. Would definitely become a regular!!! Thank you Mr. Pide!!"}
{"text":"If your want something in between a pizza slice and a panzerotto come to Mr Pide. They make delicious doughy pizza boats, Turkish style.  Huge portions. Best for sharing though I've been known to polish off one by myself!"}
{"text":"Best Turkish food, Lahmacun and Pide you may find in GTA. You can also enjoy an awesome Turkish coffee with a special daily dessert. The prices are much better that any restaurants around."}
{"text":"Great meal out !   I've never had the pleasure of trying Turkish pizza but gotta say it was yummy.   The young lady working the front was engaging and truly a pleasure."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing and the pide is huge! Incredible value for money. Owned and operated by a lovely Turkish family. My friend I was with said this was the best pide he's had since being in Istanbul. If you're on the Danforth and looking for something cheap other than souvlaki, you definitely should hit up Mr Pide."}
{"text":"On a cold February night last year my girlfriend called me and asked me if I wanted to do a little something for valentines day and naturally, I said yes!  She then told me of a place that was recommended to her through the grapevine that specialized in Turkish cuisine and being a lover for new flavors I though it to be a great suggestion.  She booked us a table and we made the journey to an area I rarely travel too (especially in February) only to discover that the 'restaurant' was not so much a restaurant but a small take out place with a very simple menu.  My initial disappointment and skepticism was quickly replaced with rampant hunger when I saw an order made fresh for another table and smelt the freshly baking dough and spicy topping cooking to perfection.  We quickly ordered a couple of the tear drop shaped pizza's to start, unaware at the time that we would be hard pressed to finish them because they were so generous and filling. We decided to order the house specialty which came with spiced ground beef and minced veg and a lighter compliment with a feta and spinach pizza that thankfully used a moderately high quality variety of feta, which really made all the difference. The specialty pizza was just that, special.  Warning: The meat was so nicely prepared and spiced that you may just be hooked for life if you live close enough to this inconspicuous little place. But not to worry because the food here is simple and filling and of a surprisingly high quality for such a reasonable price. Pizza's here start at around 8 bucks and go no further than 12, so you would be hard pressed to spend 20 dollars even if you bring a date.   The atmosphere is that of a small takeout place, but there always seem to be an interesting selection of people who eat there and the people who work at Mr. Pide are always very friendly and authentic, taking the time to make every pizza with the same care as every other pizza they have made over the years.  After wolfing down some of their delicious pizza, it's nice to grab a can of Turkish cherry nectar from the fridge instead of coke as it compliments the savory saltiness  of the pizza with a subtly sour and tart beverage that has just the right amount of sweetness to put you over the top flavor wise.    Fun Fact learned after eating at this restaurant: Turkey happens to be the worlds largest producer of cherry's cultivating more than 417 metric tons per year.  Not many restaurants can claim to be tasty and educational, so, you need to try this place if you haven't already, especially if you're in the midst of studying for an exam."}
{"text":"Their pide is delicious and Halal (for those of you wondering)! I stopped by here with a friend during the evening and I definitely recommend this place! The prices are awesome for the portion you get (prices range from $6.99-$10.99)! I ordered #20 (Ispanakli Kiymali; spinach and ground beef pide) while my friend ordered #3 (Kiymali Acik; ground beef mixed with tomatoes, peppers, onions, and spices). The waiter was alone, so it took a bit of time to wait for our orders, but it was understandable and totally worth it! I will definitely come back here and try the other pides."}
{"text":"My husband and I shared the #2 pied and really enjoyed it. The quality was excellent, server was friendly and atmosphere was nice. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I've never had one before so j can't say much about its authenticity but this was delicious!!  Takes about 10 minutes to make fresh pide which is well worth the wait - you can sip on Turkish coffee while you do.  I got the most popular #18 Karsik(?) which is a combination of most of the popular pides. I would recommend you use all the condiments - lemon, onions, tomatoes, etc."}
{"text":"Love this small shop...its a great casual place but with top quality food. All freshly made on the spot and at a very decent price. Order takes time so don't be in a rush.   1 order of anything on the menu can satisfy 2 people but I like going for assortment. Sharing is also a fun part of pide. Everything comes with fresh vegi and sauce that compliments the meal!!  Has never disappointed!"}
{"text":"I stumbled over this place a few months ago after returning from a trip to Istanbul last summer.  I longed for the sights and smells of Turkey and found them in this unassuming shop on the Danforth.  If you don't know what traditional lahmacun is then you need to find out.  This shop makes the traditional Turkish dish from scratch and it's very obvious that quality and care go into each bite.  A great alternative to pizza, and the tea is great too.  Since my first visit, I've tried 8 different menu items, all of them are winners with my favorite being #8 kiymali kasarli (ground beef&mozzarella)."}
{"text":"I have been working in MR.PIDE for over a year, and I have few things to share about this place, this place was one of the best Turkish Restaurants in Toronto and last summer the owner has changed and then everything changed the quality of the food and the way they run the business and the way they treat the customers, when you are served in this place they serve vegetables and then they bring to left over and place them with the new ones so basically they reseling the vegetables that have been already served and then they trying to save on the garbage bags, the place is not been cleaned properly and the half full garbages never thrown so there is always flies in the restaurant because this. So if you guys care about the quality and behaviour you would not eat there not deal with the fake people and also they buy the meat from stores on danforth when they say it has been bought from halal food farms so please make your decison do you like to be fooled or do you care about the truth these are the truths"}
{"text":"One of the only authentic Turkish restaurants in Toronto. Mixed pide option (My gf's favourite) let you try all the different ingredients in a single portion. If you are into meat like me, try the Pastrami one, simply amazing. I was going to deduct one star for not having free refills for tea which served in 3-4 ounce shot size glasses but what the hell, enjoyed it a lot :)"}
{"text":"New ownership, and now service is abrupt, overcharged/upsold, and skimpier toppings. Take a pass and try one of the other nearby restaurants."}
{"text":"This is absolutely as good as anything you will eat in Türkiye. You need to try this place. It's affordable, good for sharing, and best of all: actual Turkish people eat here.   Pro tip: try the Ayran with your meal! It's a salted yogurt drink. I know it sounds weird, but trust me on this one."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the pizzas I ordered here.  They are done Turkish style with the pizza in a teardrop shape.  The pizzas I had were great with toppings I don't see often (lamb anyone?) and the fact that the pizza box was stuffed with lemon slices and tomato slices and onion slices and hot peppers, geesh, makes me want to go order one right now!"}
{"text":"I don't have anything this to compare to except for traditional North American franchise or frozen pizzas. It's shaped in an oval with different toppings eg. sausage, ground beef, lamb, cheese etc.  Personally I thought it was kind of oily."}
{"text":"Delicious! I got the one that is a mix of all the ones they offer. It was really the best way to decide which one I would like. Unfortunately, they were all so good I would never be able to decide! That being said I really loved the lamb best! In the end the mixed bag is always best for indecisive me!"}
{"text":"Don't forget to order ayran! Makes a great pair with pide. If you are not so hungry get one pide for two to share. Try any, all are equally delicious and authentic."}
{"text":"It's the second time I go to this place and I love it. Food takes a while to be prepared, but it's well worth the wait. 3 pizzas are enough to feed 4 people. I haven't been to other places of this kind, but for me this feels authentic enough. Services is nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Awesome Turkish pizzas. The staff is super friendly and helpful. Have been here twice and tried 4 different pizzas. All amazing!"}
{"text":"This is mine and my sister's favourite pide place. Mind you we haven't been to any other one, instead we keep frequenting Mr. Pide. Since the first time we came here without every trying Turkish pizza and not knowing what to expect, we now have to have it about once a month. We always have a great experience and it always tastes the same, delicious!"}
{"text":"I am a sucker for good freshly baked products.  After being amazed by Pizza Pide in its hay days I was looking for another go to spot after the quality at my old fav went down a bit. Sadly this place isn't much better and has neutralized the taste to cater to main stream tastes. That isn't saying its bad by any means. It beats most of the pizza joints hands down. My buddy and I ordered two mix Pide (#18) and one lahmahchun ( #1 which isground beef on a lavash type bread) The dough was top notch so full marks for that I think its a tad bit better than their competition. As for the spicing on the meats it was ho hum. Sujjuck was kinda bland. There wasn't any bastarma on the mix pizza. The meat on Lahmahchun was thicker than its is supposed to be and spicing was lacking as well.  I can't complain much since this place is a lot more accessible than their counterpart and with the price you pay you can't go wrong. I will come back here when I want my Pide fix. A solid 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Wow! Quick service, HUGE serve! One serve would probably feed 2 people with space for a little extra.   When I got into the place I wasn't expecting much. It was pretty cheap looking. But I got the friendliest service from the gentleman at the counter so I started to relax a bit. When I received the food it smelt amazing! Took a bite and it was all worth it. Fantastic food, fantastic service, perfect! It's not classy dining, but it's excellent, especially for backpackers and those on a small budget.  Expect: to eat with your hands, simple dining, good food, freshly made to order, slightly oily (but that is how it is meant to be)"}
{"text":"My wife and I just checked this place out last week.   We arrived just as they were closing, but the owner, Omur, politely offered to make us our pides to go. He went through the menu with me and explained all the different kinds of pides. They all looked really good. We decided on the roasted lamb with cheese and the sucuk with cheese.   I watched Omur make our pides and he was really friendly, walking me through the process of preparation and cooking. He really enjoys what he does and it definitely shows in the quality of the food.  In about 7 minutes our pides were done. He prepared some onions, tomatoes, lemon wedges, parsley, and hot peppers as garnish and packed everything up neatly in a pizza box.  The bill came to just over $20 with tax and it was worth every penny. The roasted lamb pide was delicious as was the sucuk. The dough was finished with an egg wash which gave the pides a beautiful look and texture and the meat in both was amazing. The lamb pide was closed, while the sucuk was open, more like a pizza in appearance. They were very fresh and flavourful. They are decent size pides as well; we couldn't finish them and had a little left over to snack on for lunch the next day.  We've tried the pides from Zeitoun and my wife and I both prefer Omur's hands down.   This place is a gem: great food, great service, and reasonably priced. Be sure to give Omur a visit and try out his fantastic pides."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. It's a whole in the wall and the inside is nothing close to fancy with fee tables. But the food was really good. Went with a few friends for brunch  and we each got a different pide. There are a couple with eggs and meat so lots of options. It took about 20 min to arrive but man when it did it looked so fresh and so good. Each pide comes cut up on a platter with onions and chili on the side. Really good. Definitely going back. There's road parking on danforth and parking on side roads so that's good. Also halal."}
{"text":"This place is great! $7-10 for a made to order long oval shaped pizza. Size is reasonable. It was just about right for me who is a big eater. It comes with some stuff on the side like garlic dip, tomato, onions, and parsley. All were fresh and delicious.   I like places that specialize. This place serves nothing but Pide. These guys are pros. But I currently don't have any other Pide places to compare to.   Taste wise, this is a good alternative to \"regular\" pizza. The outer layer is almost crispy and very soft. The toppings were a little salty but very delicious. They put an adequate amount of stuff so I feel the price-value ratio is pretty good. Most of them don't have tomato sauce and some of them don't have cheese. I'm no health expert but I think these are healthier than \"regular\" pizzas in general.  Pide is not easy to find in Toronto so this place is very niche. But it's a niche well done. I'd come more often if I lived closer but right now, it's too far of a trek."}
{"text":"Cool quick food option and cheap. Nice service. Better then any fast food option in the area."}
{"text":"Pide (Turkish pizza) was delicious & comes in a wide variety of choices and comes with fresh toppings like tomato, parsley, lemon, onion & hot peppers on the side.  Service is friendly & attentive.  Close to subway.  Good prices."}
{"text":"I finally knocked this one off of my \"places to try on the Danforth\" list with a former coworker last night and it was worth the wait.  The last time we tried to go here they were closed--it must have been Monday.  Between us we went with #19 and #11 which is kind of boring but it was hard to decide and I wanted to avoid onions.  Besides, these (one was cheese and Turkish sausage, the other cheese and pepperoni) gave us a great way to compare.  What came out to us was a long plate with the pides all cut up and ready to share--very nice touch.  (Not sure if this is the way you normally eat them or not).  They were well made.  Thing, crispy crust, nice cheese and tasty meats.  There is no sauce.  But there was a delicious dipping sauce on the side.  The service was fine--just one girl taking orders and bringing out food and one guy in the back.    The value can't really be beat.  About $10 for more than enough food.  I also had a tea which was delicious--really enjoyed that small, glass cup.    My sense is that a lot of young students go here for cheap lunches and dinners.  It would work quite well for a family meal out as most kids would eat the basic pides.  It would also work for a date if you are really early (casual environment, you get to work out which two to order and share, etc.) into something or if you are really late and past the point of needing to impress one another on a Friday night.    This could never replace regular pizza for me but it is a nice change.  I'll be back.  Highly recommended--and worth a trip out east, especially if you are into trying different kinds of pizza."}
{"text":"Didn't know what to expect from Turkish (pizza) but it was absolutely wonderful. We got the #18 ( I think ) which was sort of a sampler; really tasty! The people who work there are so friendly and kind. I'm here for a week and definitely will be eating there again before I leave town."}
{"text":"Mr pide has the original Turkish pide just like you would have in Turkey.  The flavours are authentic, the pide is made on the spot with fresh ground beef and other ingredients.  Bottom line it's simple yet authentic. Great for a snack or lunch."}
{"text":"Such a different take on pizza! Loved it and would definitely order again whenever I'm in greek town. If you haven't tried it, I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"All I can say is that the staff are über friendly and the portions are massive! I had to take the rest home.  Pretty cheap if you can get two meals lol  Will be back 100%"}
{"text":"It was like traveling to Arabia, but in my mouth. Delicious.   Also, Turkish coffee. Turkish coffee is fantastic."}
{"text":"Tried Turkish pizza for the first time. This was an excellent experience. They have a huge variety of options. My favourite was the lamb. Truly unique. Very quick service. Each pide easily serves 2."}
{"text":"I recalled having one of these during the Taste of Danforth a few years back and I have always wanted to go back and try it again. This stuff is like a cross between a panzerotti, pizza and a pizza pocket. It's kinda like yummy goodness in an open face pizza dough wrap!  This was for the most part as good as I had remembered it to be. The dough is exceptional; warm, soft, pillowy with a slight chew. However, I was slightly disappointed with the quality of the toppings. Their Turkish sausage reminds me of hotdogs. The sauce, cheese and veggies are your typical run-of-the-mill stuff. Nothing really stood out in terms of the ingredients but perhaps I was expecting too much? Even down to the dipping sauce; it reminds me of the Pizza Pizza garlic dipping sauce (good but nothing specially really).  I would say give it a try even if it's just for the yummy dough! But in this city that is so saturated with pizza and stuff that reminds us of pizza; I am not sure if this one stands out."}
{"text":"We tried the Kiymaly Acik and it was very good. The price is also very reasonable. No complain about the customer service either, very nice and friendly people."}
{"text":"???? ?????? ??????? ?????? ?????????? ?????? ???? ???? ???? ????????????? ?????? ????"}
{"text":"Since I am a regular customer I felt that I need to put an update to the review to answer to the various reviews that seem not to the understand what \"authentic Turkish \" means.   For vegetarians : there's no such thing as vegetarian in Turkish culture. It doesn't exist. There are several pides that don't have meat , but they do not cater to vegetarians but simply to regular meat eaters who would like a change of pace once in a while.  No. 14, 15, 17 are all vegetarian. They will do.   For vegans: go to another restaurant. Vegan is non existent concept in Turkish culture.   For the Gluten-free crowd: no, just no. Celiac disease affects less than 0.01% of the population and the rest are just faking it.  Substitutions: don't bother. These Pides were served with the same ingredient for the last six centuries, so to think they would substitute for you is just unrealistic  The stereo pumps Turkish popular music which is a Great addition to the authenticity. If you're looking for the crapman Bieber or raggaethon- you're out of luck.   In conclusion : this is the most authentic Turkish cuisine place on toronto. If you're looking for \"fusion\" - keep looking"}
{"text":"Pides are good, but I have recently found out that this place may not be halal? I won't be returning, and would highly recommend Mustafa's in North York over this place as there is free parking there all day! The service and ambience are great at Mustafa's and there is very little price difference between these two restaurants (and Mustafa's is confirmed halal). Overall, a pass for me as we were assured by the waiter at Mr. Pide that the meat is halal, but it all seemed a little shady tbh."}
{"text":"ahoy there, matey! hungry for boat-shaped pizza? well come on aboard!  try the \"karisik\" for topping variety spicy pep', lamb, more  perfectly-cooked dough each topping is quite distinct and of course, tasty!  lahmacun's great too ground beef, spices, but no cheese and, um, not boat-shaped"}
{"text":"This place use to be amazing and had such a great vibe about it.  The owner was nice and humble and very hospitable.  Since the new owners have taken over this place has change and the food too.  Our last visit took 3 people to take our same order and in addition they told us we couldn't make the same substitutions we have made week after week  for the past 2 years. We asked for our pides to be well done (to all three staff members) and the wrong Pide came !!!!!! After repeating the order 3 times to 3 people !!!! ..... The albeit these came well done unlike the perilous experience  ....  The new staff makes this place hard to like as they seem to have to force a smile.  Staff is constantly running from the back to the front of this place which makes it more stressful during a meal.  Our experiences since the owners changed has been going downhill..... I doubt we will be back .... Can the old owners pls come back ..... Please"}
{"text":"Wow, I mean wow!   Solid 5*  Their lahmacun could be one of the best I've ever tried outside of Turkey, including the US. Thin crispy dough topped with a light mixture of minced meat, tomatoes, peppers and spices cooked to perfection. Lemon juice adds the right amount of acidity to perfection. Definitely hearty but not overwhelming. Just the right amount of chilly kick.   The owner is a really nice guy, the room is large and lots of space for big groups. Not a pretentious place, causal inside. Good eats, good vibes, good prices.   Last but not least; make sure you get one of those yoghurt drinks to accompany your lahmacun, you will need a refreshment after all the spiciness.   Yum!"}
{"text":"My wife was in the area and wanted to know what to pick up for dinner since she was by the Danforth.  Hmmm....let's see, what does the Danforth have that us Markhamnites don't have?  I got it!  Turkish Pizza!!  Mr. Pide is a well know spot that serves authentic Turkish Pizzas to the masses.  From the thin flat traditional Lahmacun, to the boat shaped Pides that comes in a variety of flavours such as spinach and cheese, pepperoni, ground beef and lamb, the food they serve here is solid and delicious.  Not sure what to get?  Try the assorted #18 Karisik which comes with a little bit of everything.    Priced from $9-$12 each serving is enough for 1 and comes with a side of fresh tomatos, onions, curly parsley, pickled chillis and a dipping sauce.  A solid 4/5.  Well done Mr. Pide, well done!!"}
{"text":"This place had been in my bookmarks forever. I finally had a chance to check it out. I was quite happy with my experience here. The staff was helpful in helping us make our decision and very friendly. Tried the soup which was very nice. Had the sampler and was very happy with the choice. Very tasty and perfect for the two of us. Overall i was very satisfied and will be back again.  Makes a great addition to the everyday pizza and on Pizza Row as i call it i guess they stand apart from the others. Seems like in between Donlands & Pape there's a Pizza place every second store. I bet i'm right ;-P"}
{"text":"So good.  So so so good.  Fabulous pide.  Really helpful staff.  Interesting beverage options.  I am a fan of the sour cherry nectar.  Nice glass of Turkish tea is offered at the end of the meal.    If they ever start serving Turkish breakfast, I'll have to revise the rating to a 6 out of 5.  Great place.  Go.  Eat pide."}
{"text":"I drop by here about once a month, get bunch of stuff, freeze them and reheat them later when i want to..So, i am pretty much a regular here. You can't find the same type of food any where else, any better than this in Toronto.Believe me, i tried. Some places use too oily meat to make more profit. This place is limiting that well because there should be some fatty meat too and it is good. One star taken off because meat can be a little better(tastes a little like costco meat) but changing the meat increases the cost and in that area, people won't pay more than that... So,a little critic and tip to improve; may trying putting a little milk or yogurt when marinating but only a couple of hours before. That makes the meat taste a little more tender and better. Yet, it is still very good.Best i could find so far.  Service is good. Owner is friendly and respects his customers. The dough they use it nice and thin and tasty. I bet almost everyone who like Italian food, Turkish food, Middle Eastern, Mediterranean food will leave this place happily after trying this place. Also not sure if it is in the menu but when i call in, the guy makes this anyway(thanks).  Try Kasarli Etli Pide ( small minced beef with cheese)."}
{"text":"Awesome!!! 21 varieties of Turkish \"pizza\".  Made fresh to order, a gentle blend of cheesy goodness and meaty wonderfulness... Yes, veggie options for the animal-saviours."}
{"text":"Located in Greek town but more Turkish or rather Mediterranean, this place was awesome. The food was fresh, delicious, plentiful and inexpensive. 5 stars from my perspective. Service was also quick and I'll be back for sure for more."}
{"text":"My first time eating Turkish pizza and boy am I glad that I picked Mr Pide (pronounced Peed-hey): a small take out kinda place far, far away from home! Talk about beginner's luck!  We went there on a nice, bright afternoon for lunch and the restaurant front was wide open to let the sun stream in. Add to that, Omar, the guy who runs the place is really nice. He walked us through the menu and helped us select the mixed pide. He seemed a bit concerned that the pide would be too spicy for us, which we assured him would not be the case.  The tear drop shaped pide came to us piping fresh accompanied with garlic sauce, parsley, jalapenos, onions and tomatoes. The dough was delicious! I enjoyed the overall flavors, and especially the beef sausage pide, though it could be even more flavorful. I liked the lamb the least, since the taste of lamb was just too overpowering.  Adding fresh parsley to the pide was delicious. The next time I visit, I am going to ask Omar to heighten the flavors and maybe even over spice!  While we were basking in the after glow of a good meal, Omar brought us (and the other patrons) complimentary Turkish tea!   Good food: +1 Good service: +1 Value for money: +1 Returnability factor: +1  1+1+1+1= Yay! I am a fan."}
{"text":"Delicious with good service. Food showed up on time. Order was right. Cashier was very pleasant to deal with. Dessert was must try!"}
{"text":"Very good but a little greasy depending on the selection. Flavours and selection of toppings/fillings  are wonderful, and the sampler was our favourite. Recommend it highly if you want a great alternative to pizza."}
{"text":"Mr. Pide is amazing! Located on the danforth, this Turkish spot definitely serves the best Turkish pizza in the city.   Mr. Pide has indoor seating, but I usually opt for takeout. They are famous for their pide (pronounced pea-day), but have Turkish sweets as well.   When you call for takeout, the pide is made within 15-20 min. The prices are also extremely reasonable, and they have an extensive menu with lots of variety.   The takeout boxes come complete with fresh parsley, tomatoes, and onions, along with a tasty ranch/garlic dipping sauce.   My favourite pide is lahmajoun, made with finely ground meat and spices on top of the thin, flatbread crust. It's so delicious, and very authentic.   The cheesy chicken (tavuklu) is also really good!! And they have vegetarian options as well.   It's always my go to spot when I'm in the area, and I'm always hungry for more! Definitely 5 stars every visit!"}
{"text":"Decided to try pide for the first time because I didn't want to order pizza. It was delivered in about 30 minutes and the guy was nice. The pides themselves were hot and freaking delicious - way better than the pizza you get from the big chains. I got the #1 Lahmacun (ground beef blended with garlic, onions, tomatos, parsley, and herbs) and #11 Sucuklu Kasarli (Turkish sausage & mozzarella cheese). Each pide is under $10 and they're huge... they're also accompanied with dip, fresh tomato, lemon, parsley, onion, and jalapenos, at no extra charge. The Turkish sausage was spicy and ironically, I did find it to be more spicy than the Lahmacun, the only item that is marked as spicy on the menu."}
{"text":"Been wanting to go here for ages and finally had a good reason, we headed here with my friend and her boyfriend, who is Turkish, so of course he was enthused to show us the place.  We ordered 4 pideh's which all arrived pre-sliced on a huge platter garnished with tomatoes, onions and parsley. We had two of the menu #1 option which is delicious, super thin crust with ground beef, spices and diced tomatoes/onions. Highly recommend that one.  The other two we tried had a thicker crust, were still tasty but I definitely prefer the less bread options.  Pretty cheap, worked out to about $15 a person including soft-drinks, tax and tip.  Place is sort of hole-in-the-wall so don't go expecting fancy decor, but service was quick and it definitely feels like an authentic experience."}
{"text":"Ask any Turkish-Torontonian, and you'll hear an earful about how our city lacks good Turkish cuisine. While pideh is an awfully specific and more fast food than authentic cuisine, Mr. Pide somehow captures a classic Turkish vibe I have not found anywhere else in Toronto!  The pideh is somewhat of an armageddon between flatbread and pizza dough, and the ingredients are cooked into it in a fashion that is somewhere between a regular pizza and a calzone! Sounds complicated, but it comes out pretty delicious.  I tried the Sibzeli Pide which featured an array of veggies and feta cheese. The pideh was prepared in about 10 minutes and was a good bit of food for the price.  Overall I would give Mr. Pide another go, but hope that they feature more vegetarian and even a few non traditional toppings (sun-dried tomato pideh would be something to look forward to). Also wish it was open a bit later as it would provide an amazing late night snack!"}
{"text":"GUYS, I AM ADDICTED...! This place consistently produces great Turkish pizzas.....I don't want to leave Toronto just because the roasted lamb pide is so good."}
{"text":"This is a nice destination especially for those who prefer the all \"halal\" food. A nicely crafted pies Turkish style with delicious ingredients like the pastrami and the Turkish sausage. With options for vegetarians too. It's very affordable and the service is ok."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza, I ordered #16 which was the assorted vegetables with feta. Was not disappointed, in fact when the pizza came out couldn't stop staring at that beauty. Tasted even better than it looked. My buddies got #18, and they too loved it! Would highly recommend"}
{"text":"The owner apprenticed at Pizza Pide for 3 years before opening up this place 5 years ago.  When he's on point, his stuff is epic. When he's not there, it's not.  Order the assorted #18.  Sit and enjoy."}
{"text":"After seeing a show at the Danforth Music Hall. My friends and I were starving and this was one of the only places open after 10 pm.  We got the #9 with cheese and the #17, both were delicious. This is a really great family run place with fantastic service. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Omg- this place is by far my favourite guilty pleasure treat spot in all of the GTA!!  I take everyone there- local friends and all out of town visitors.   For $8-10, you get a large, leaf shaped Turkish style \"pizza\". It's way better then pizza though.   It's tender dough, covered in tenderizing yogurt (you don't taste the yogurt though because once cooked, it blends in), topped with meat, spinach, cheese and eggs (or any combo of these items). They have an amazing garlic sauce to dip you slices in too. The pizzas come with onion slices and lime to squeeze over the top- awesome.   On top of it all, the meat is all halal and the sausage and pepperoni is very high quality and delicious spiced.   You will be stuffed but it will be hard to stop before you've eaten your whole pide.   Staff is always, always, always pleasant and hospitable. Decor is simple.    A hot cup of Turkish coffee after your meal will help energize you after you've thoroughly stuffed yourself!"}
