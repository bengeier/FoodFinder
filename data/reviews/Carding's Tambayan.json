{"text":"Our first time coming here and we loved It!!  Lehn was so warm and inviting. We were treated like family. She's so beautiful; inside and out! Definitely recommend the Pork Sisig and Kare Kare but all of the food we ordered (Lechon kawalli, crispy pata, Chicken wings, fish ball) was delicious. Love this place and definitely going to come back!"}
{"text":"My friends and I were looking for a new place to have fun and sing some karaoke. This is NOT the place. The KJ's are not even real DJ/KJ's, so the music and singers sound horrible. Plus, the karaoke songs they have are really bad versions -- you know, the unprofessional synthesizer kind of versions. The location is kind of scary as well. It's a dark, run-down area which hasn't quite been developed yet. Food was fair, but took a long time to come out. DJ's don't have a clue what to play, or how to adjust things. Maybe a good place for trashy-karaoke singing."}
{"text":"If you want a cool place to hang where you can eat and listen to music or just to have a couple of drinks, then come here. You won't ever regret it, the service is excellent even the food too, just absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Went here with my daughter for dinner. I can't assess the general cleanliness due to limited lighting. The food is good and reasonably priced. The staff are pleasant and polite. The atmosphere is loud... It's a karaoke bar? So, it's not for a fine dining experience folks. Definitely not to have a serious conversation over dinner kinda place"}
{"text":"Ok, so I didn't really go to the location, i ordered from uber eats, i wanted to try it since it has good reviews.. but oh my, i was so dissapointed.. i ordered tocilog, and the tocino is burnt, it's so burnt it looks like a charcoal, and i'm not exaggerating... i took a photo of my order and the food... terrible,.. how can they deliver their food out like that.. i'll make sure i'll let my friends and family know about your food... so they don't waste money on it... i was so excited when the food arrived then i literally lost my appetite when i opened the box.. wow!"}
{"text":"We plan to go enjoy the nightlife and restaurant here soon but I do have to say--if you need food for a party event, this is where you get it.  We have gotten Filipino food in quantity for parties at other places before but this was the best tasting and the best value.  We got 3 big \"full\" size pans for $272 and it was a lot of food...  One of them was Beef Kaldereta that other places want to charge you more for(understandable because of the amount of beef)...  We also got Vegetable Chop Suey and Pork Sisig which is probably the best this American guy has ever had....   Not normally our end of town but it was for our daughter's baby shower and she lives in that area also....  We will go hang out there soon and will get our party food here from now on no matter how far we have to drive...  Thanks \"Lhen\"(sp?) and Carding's Tambayan!!!"}
{"text":"We had an amazing experience here! The owners actually care and make you feel like you're a guest in their home. I am visiting from California and my step moms birthday was yesterday she and I sang karaoke for her first time ever and we had an absolute blast! This place is a must! It's tucked in which makes it kind of a hidden gem, but totally worth it. Great food, great company, and amazing customer service!"}
{"text":"Were here at 2 am and they have nothing to drink except for Corona, Heineken, Miller Light, and Bud Light. We also ordered calamari and was told they don't have any, no one was in the resto just us. the host was great but i was wondering if they don't have anything why are they still open? Well this is an experience but we will never go back here again."}
{"text":"I've called three times. No one answers.  I went today with my family from out of town and the door was locked.  The sign said they were open. I called and no one answered.  I checked the hours and it said they were open, but nothing. 
I would definitely call before going. This has happened to me twice already! It's not like I live nearby either.  I make it a choice to come here because I liked the food. It's hard to find decent, not down, not buffet style Filipino food that's not in a grocery store.  It's more difficult when the shop says it's open but no one answers"}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place, i tried their special mix balls platter and pancit canton topped with fried pork as garnish, friendly staff and personally greeted by DJ Mar!"}
{"text":"I was at Carding's Tambayan on Flamingo and Jones with Denise Fuleihan and Jack Soderberg for the Grand Opening Aug 8. The place was packed. The food and the service was good. The sabau I had later that night was excellent. Overall I had a good time with great friends. Enjoyed listening to my friend Denise sing as always. They had a few other good singers that night also doing karaoke. I however chose not to perform that night. I will go there again."}
{"text":"We actually came here since Café de Cebu down the street ran out of Lechon Kawali (Filipino style fried crispy pork belly.) How dare they, right?! Our friend (Jeff V.) wanted to take us on a Filipino food tour and since Café de Cebu couldn't deliver - we gave this place a shot! It's an added bonus that they are open from 3PM until 4AM and serve food throughout their business hours - perfect for all of those late nights and early Vegas mornings.

A family-run business; they quickly helped us feel right at home. Still basking in their grand opening a month ago, the waitress Crystal and owner Rocky were full of personality and really sweet. The ambiance here is like your typical legit Filipino spot - casual, dimly-lit and homey; almost like you're dining in someone's home but fitted with: hip music (top 40/EDM/Filipino hits), a dance floor, strobe lights and a full wall projector with speakers for all of your entertainment, dancing and Karaoke needs. Unfortunately no one in my party had the guts to sing, so we went straight to business and ordered a slew of authentic goodies!

Lechon Kawali (Filipino style fried crispy pork belly) $11 - This dish always seems to run out at great Filipino joints, so get it while you can! We ended up ordering 2 rounds! My whole party enjoyed the roasted, deep fried, extra crispy fried pig belly (it was slightly overcooked, so a little dry) but their house made vinegar sauce took this dish to another level! It helped add some moisture back to the pork belly and you will want to dip everything in that sauce! 4/5

Original Pork Sisig (Deep fried pork belly chopped with onions and jalapeno) $13 - Served on a sizzling platter, this dish stayed piping hot and delicious! I enjoyed the subtle acid of the vinegar which created a nice layer of flavor and the texture of the pork belly was extra crispy! I also liked the flavor that the jalapeno added to the dish! 5/5

\"Wet Pussy\" Creamy Garlic Mussels (Green half shell green mussels baked with garlic and cream, served on a sizzling platter.) $12 - It's pretty sad when none of your friends believe you when you tell them - that's the actual name of the dish written on the menu! LOL! Guys. I'm for real not making it up. We ended up having a lot of fun with it in restaurant though. :p It was bubbling hot, super creamy and garlicky! It's a nice variation of the classic Japanese version of baked mussels that most of us are use to. My party inhaled it even though we were all stuffed! 4/5

Bihon Guisado Con Lechon (Bihon noodles stir-fried with garlic, vegetables, shrimp and lechon kawali (fried pork belly) $11 - This is my first time having Bihon noodles and it wasn't bad! Jeff V. really liked it and gave it his thumbs up. I honestly prefer the clear \"Pancit\" type of noodles - but the flavor of this dish was good. 3/5

Garlic Fried Rice (Jasmine rice fried with garlic and egg bits) $8 - The rice was lightly aromatic, but super moist. My party enjoyed eating the rice with the lechon kawali - great combination! Only a minor complaint is that I wish the garlic bits were fried a little more brown to offer more garlic flavor and it could definitely use more egg! 3/5

We ended the evening with Halo Halo (traditional Filipino style dessert) $5 - Their version is not like a traditional halo halo topped with ice cream. It's served in a clear plastic cup and topped high so it was slightly difficult to get to the goods down below. Also my party all agreed that there was far too much ice; it was hard to enjoy the sweet flavor and texture of the toppings and we sure missed a nice scoop of creamy ice cream on top! 2/5

You bet we stuffed our bellies to the max and we'll be back soon! The environment is a great spot to bring all of your foodie adventurers to dine family-style, sing, dance and laugh the night away!"}
{"text":"this place sucks, if there's a zero feedback i will give it to them. we went to check out this place and get something to eat of course , so i stood their for 20 minutes to order something and no one is on the counter to take my order, and all i see is some customers singing ( drunk and out of tune and they suck), why don't you guys closed permanently"}
{"text":"I have one word to describe my experience. WEIRD.

For those that want to know, \"Tambayan\" in english means a place to hang out where you can eat and just relax.

So me and my party of 7 show up a little after 9 pm on tuesday 5/15/18. Found the door to be locked. As we all talked about going to the Thai Bbq place next door, all of a sudden, some dude opens up the door and motions for us to come in. We all give each other a puzzled look and went on in. Now if it was only a few of us I would have hesitated and probably would have said, \"No thanks!\". Since we were a big group we decided to go for it since we all wanted to see if the pork sisig was good based on the pic we saw.

So we sit down and are given menus by the same guy that opened the door. He said that our server was gonna be here soon. A few minutes later, some lady shows up from the outside and takes our order. Come to find out that the guy that opened the door and sat us was also the cook.

So we order Pork Sisig, Fish Balls, and Lechoh Kawali. 

The Pork Sisig($13) came out on its traditional sizziling platter. It was made up of pork, onions, garlic, and topped off with a slice of lemon to squeeze on. Was sorely disappointed in this dish. The good kind of pork sisig that I am used to also has chopped jalapenos and should have a freshly cracked egg on top of it for you to mix in while the meat is still sizzling. Overall taste was just ok. Did not meet my expectations and it seemed to be overpriced to me.

The Fish Balls($8.00) were also not he kind that im used to. These are deep fried and soft and chewy with nothing in the middle. These ones we got were stuffed with some kind of meat that I could not recognize. I only ended up eating just one ball. At least the pickled cucumber dressing it came with gave it some life but this dish was not to my liking.

The Lechon Kawali($12.00) was probably the only thing decent that we had. Its basically sliced pork belly deep fried until crispy. Comes with a sauce to dip in (Mang Tomas for all you true Flip food connoisseurs). In this case they gave us a sauce that they said they made in house. It was just ok.

For dessert we wanted to order halo-halo but they said they didnt have all the ingredients so we ended up just getting Turon($5.00). It is plantain sprinkled with brown sugar with lanka (jackfruit) placed on top and then rolled up in an eggroll wrapper then deep fried until crispy. It was just ok.

I almost forgot to mention that when we got our food, another random dude appeared out of nowhere and started singing karaoke. So what got was dinner AND a show. Dude that sang was decent. Sang everything from Al Green's \"Let's Stay Together\" to Josh Turner's \"Your Man\". 

So overall, even though the whole thing seemed weird, I thought it was just ok. Given the facts that the place seemed kind of shady and their hours are not accurate, I dont think I will be coming back here. Plus I have had better sisig from at least 3 other places. Hit me up if you want to know those places.

{"text":"The special chicken wings are my go to! It's just the right amount of sweet and spicy. I definitely recommend trying the pork sisig, it's the best I've ever had! The bartender knows how to make a great drink! Make sure you say hello ;)"}
{"text":"It was Saturday night, we were in Vegas, and we were looking for good Filipino food and karaoke, though not necessarily in that order. We found Carding's Tambayan on Yelp and couldn't be more excited.

Open until 4, with plenty of space for our large party of 12+, I can't stop raving about how great this joint was.

We had pork sisig, chicken and shrimp pancit, lechon kawali, pork sinigang, and enough drinks all around to put down an elephant. Hands down, one of the best Filipino dining experiences I've ever had. It felt like I was visiting someone's family home, and the owner made us all feel very welcome.

Karaoke and the dance floor were the highlight of the evening, with a DJ who could find whatever you asked him for, performing slick sound engineering on the sly. Everyone in the party felt like superstars!

5/5, and only because I can't give more than 5 stars!"}
{"text":"There was a review earlier here that's sums it up perfectly for me too...so I quote - Fun. Filling. Family. The hosts was very inviting, we felt like part of their family, and had a very good time...we ended up doing karaoke for like 2 hours and they were always so accommodating, and boy, the food...one dish is enough for 3 people, and they mentioned it in that at the beginning so we could plan accordingly. it tastes good too...will recommend it!"}
{"text":"Seriously, hands down, my favorite place to eat Kare Kare. Pair it with Bagoong Fried Rice & it's THE perfect meal. I never leave hungry & the owners are amazing! They take really good care of their customers. It's in a convenient location not too far from the freeways, on the corner of Jones & Flamingo."}
{"text":"Celebrated my birthday here with family and friends. We called in ahead of time to see if they can do a boodle fight style or kamayan if we order their seafood and inihaw platters and they said yes! They not only did a fantastic job with the set up, the food was superb! They also have karaoke with huge song selections. We enjoyed singing our hearts out while waiting for the food. 

This hidden gem is a family business and you can really tell that they run their business with passion. The service was exceptional and will definitely recommend this to family and friends."}
{"text":"Lhen and her crew are top notch for customer service!! All the dishes are sharing style portions, and everything is delicious! We had a large party together for a celebration of life luncheon for my Lola this afternoon, and they hosted us Kamayan style which was a super unique and fun experience. Lhen guided me on how to best preorder for the lunch last Tueaday, and had all the food ready and laid out about 20 mins after our reservation time which was timed perfectly. The food was perfect temp still when we finally started eating, we waited to start since we had some late arrivals. They even had their karaoke DJ there in the afternoon which was so fun for the kids to do!! This place is seriously a hidden gem, with excellent customer service, excellent food, and a really welcoming crew. Looking forward to come visit for another group gathering very soon."}
{"text":"This place is okay, waitress was very nice! But when it comes to the food we ordered? Blaah. The pork sisig was nothing but ONION! Tasted like onion, smelled like onion! Omg! The DAING na bangus was huge! That was the best part of everything."}
{"text":"Ordered food from grub hub to be delivered. Ordered the garlic fried rice and egg rolls. Not disappointed at all. Will be ordering again!"}
{"text":"Fun. Filling. Family. These three words pretty much sum up my experience here. There is karaoke going and people are super good at it, it's crazy! The food is amazing too, I had the adobo fried rice and wings. The girls working here do a great job at making you feel like part of their family and have made a new friend and regular!"}
{"text":"Ordered from yelp/eat24. I arrived roughly 20 minutes after expecting a simple transaction - they give me food and I give them money. Here's what really happened.

I walked in and there were no real customers. It looked liked family, friends and tsismis. There were no actual restaurant things happening. No one was being served food - including me.

I told them I was here for pickup. Then it was a bunch of nothing. It almost seemed like they had no idea I even placed an order. I stood around a bit thinking that the guy that just went into the back was going to come out with my food. Nope.

I sat down and waited. And waited. Nothing.

At one point, I was told that the delay was because of a health inspection earlier in the day. Okay, what? Obvious lie. Even if that was the case, how does that impact the non-existent dinner service? I was a bit embarrassed for the lady that said this.

I ended up waiting more than 30 minutes before leaving. That was plenty of time to overcook a tortang talong and some chicken wings. Hell, they could've overcooked it twice. 

Unprofessional."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a hangout place with delicious and reasonably priced food, friendly staff, and free kareoke, Carding's is the spot! Thank you for a great night. Wish we couldve stayed longer, but we will come back here if we're in Vegas again."}
{"text":"Enjoyed this place. Love to sing. Great sound system and DJ."}
{"text":"Went here with the gf Saturday late night with the gf. Had a great time watching the people song karaoke.  Tried the seafood balls which were great (seemed to have the consistency of mini corn dogs, but maybe that was the Red Horse and San Miguel's influence.) The girlfriend and I shared the mussels  (wet pussy?) And those were bomb. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"so, Hubby wanted to try them out. so we cruzzed around until they opened, low and behold they weren't open yet. we stayed for about 30 more minutes and still no show. so we ended up eating thai food next door. hubby was sooo annoyed and disappointed. :-("}
{"text":"Food, Festive, and Family-Oriented. 
That's how this establishment serves the Vegas food scene.

Las Vegas brings the best in everything, including food. 
There are tons of diverse restaurants serving dishes from every part of the world - including the Philippines. Las Vegas has a vibrant & growing Filipino community, and if you're a foodie, some of the best Filipino food can be found in Las Vegas - in particular, at Carding's Tambayan.

Known for their karaoke/open mic nights & a dance floor with a DJ/live band, Carding's Tambayan delivers delicious Filipino food from 5 p.m. to 5 a.m. every day! - its location is off the Strip (it's just about a $10 Uber ride - 10-15 min. away from where you're staying along the Strip), but it's a destination for foodies & adventurers alike! Highly recommended to think outside the box (or Strip) & see for yourselves to get some grub that's way better & way cheaper than the food places along the Strip!

Among their most well-liked plates are the original Pork Sisig - deep-fried pork belly mixed with onions and jalapeno, and the Balls Platter -comprised of deep fried squid, deep fried shrimp, deep friend chicken balls, kikiam, which is deep-fried ground pork and vegetables. Their take on the Lumpiang Shanghai (Deep-Fried Filipino Egg Rolls) is HELLA GOOD that it can cure a hangover AND satisfy your cravings. However, I've heard that their Bangus Sisig is to-die for! Too bad they ran out of it when we visited for some late night munchies! 

One of their specialties that's ordered on a regular basis, is their Tapsilog.
While the entire word Tapsilog is known as an ordinary word in Filipino, broken apart, each syllable actually stands for something else. Per tapsiloganusa.com, \"TAP comes from TAPA, which is cured beef usually marinated with salt, vinegar, soy sauce and pepper. SI comes from SINANGAG which is Filipino fried rice, made with white rice, garlic, salt and pepper. LOG comes from the word ITLOG meaning EGG. Served and cooked at any style.\" 

This restaurant not only serves delicious Filipino food, but also offers a comfortable homely feel - the owners care for you & chop it up with you like they know you really well. It is perfect for a casual outing with the family and friends; even a place for an \"after party\" after clubbing/nightlife on the Strip!"}
{"text":"Great filipino food! The kare kare is bomb! Its family owned so we really feel at home and Len, the owner was really nice. She even sat down with us and chat a bit. The kids loved the chicken wings and sinigang na baboy! You wont be needing to go boxes because you'll finish everything its that good!!!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and enjoyed the old-school Filipino ambience. BUT Service is terrible! They messed up our beer orders, gave our beers to other parties, didn't check up on our table so we always had to flag the manangs down, ordered sisig but never got it. Tried to charge us for it too."}
{"text":"My family really enjoyed Carding's Tambayan. We were in Vegas for a family reunion the hostess was so friendly, she welcomed you as if u were her family coming for dinner. The food was amazing, my Aunts & Uncles raised in Philippines said it was Authentic as back home. My Auntie loved the Halo halo and the Adobe was my favorite."}
{"text":"Really good food nice atmosphere n amazing service owners always there it's amazing how they take care of u, really have to check this place n try the food everything I have try it's been on point... Care care,  chicken adobe, fried pork... N more... Definitely coming back soon..."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant!  Authentic Filipino food, with great service. It's family owned so the atmosphere is super friendly.  They also have karaoke and live entertainment.  Jocelyn took care of us and we will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Great service, generous portions, and super authentic dishes. I love this place . Their chicken wings are off the chain (the best I've had in Las Vegas) and their Kilawin Hipon is to die for. There is a full service bar, karaoke, a good sized dance floor, and strobe light to go with it. I plan to come back again and again since the food tastes so damn good. AND they stay open until 4pm or later in the morning (perfect for after hours from the Vegas club life)."}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday evening after watching a show on the Strip. Carding's isn't close to the Strip but we were glad we made the trip. There was a private party being held in the restaurant but the owners still opened their doors to us. They were having karaoke and so the place was quite loud. We didn't mind it at all because the atmosphere was festive and lively. We ordered lumpiang shanghai, lechon kawali and pork sisig. Our server even gave us a big bowl of complimentary white rice with our dinner. The food was all very delicious and authentic! My favorite was the lechon kawali which was super crispy and juicy. My partner-in-dine preferred the pork sisig. We were so stuffed that we had to take some of the food home. They also serve Philippine beer. And even with the party going on, the food came out quickly. Authentic and tasty Filipino dishes at reasonable prices! Wish I could come here every day."}
{"text":"Filipino restaurant, dancing, karaoke, kamayan style dining... First time here and the service was amazing.. They are VERY FRIENDLY.. Food wise, we ordered: bulalo, sisig, and fried shrimp. Everything was good. My little girl had about 6 small rice bowl with the bulalo. It was that good. Food pricing was reasonable as well. We will definitely come back."}
