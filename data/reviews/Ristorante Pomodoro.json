{"text":"Service pourri. Tous les repas servis (nous étions 5) n'avaient aucune saveur. Définitivement la dernière fois."}
{"text":"Stopped in during the Italian Week Festival and we were pleasantly surprised by the size and ambiance of this restaurant. The service was great and timely for our group of 6. Adrian was our main server and he was very attentive. We were given 2 large bottles of water and then we got our Italian beer and red wine followed by our appetizer of meat, cheese and olives and of course delicious warm bread rolls. They had prepared a condensed version of their usual menu during this Festival and we each made our selection of different pizzas and pasta dishes. We left full and happy. This is a restaurant I would go to again with pleasure."}
{"text":"On my visit to Montreal, Canada, I stopped by this Italian restaurant considered by the locals as one of the best pizzerias in town.   I ordered the Pizza Margherita which was decent and the Fried Calamari that was excellent, probably the best Calamari I ever had.  I will definitely comeback to this restaurant on my next visit to Montreal."}
{"text":"J'ai mangé au Ristorante Pomodo pour la première fois en Juillet, avec 2 autres personnes. C'était un soir de semaine donc c'était assez tranquille.  Nous avons commencé la soirée avec une focaccia maison qui était délicieuse, surtout avec un ajout d'huile piquante faite maison, qui donne un bon kick.  Ensuite, nous avons pris une entrée de salade Caprese : tomates, mozzarella di bufala, basilic frais et huile d'olive ; c'est vraiment délicieux. C'est une de mes salades préférées, car elle est tellement simple et fraîche, surtout pour l'été.  Pour le repas principal, nous avons commandé la pizza Inferno et la pizza Mare e Monte. La pizza Inferno était recouverte de nduja (saucisse piquante Italienne). C'était la première fois que j'en mangeais et c'était tellement bon - j'y retournerais n'importe quand juste pour ça !   La pizza Mare e Monte, avec crevettes de Matane, tomates cerises et champignons était ok, mais elle manquait d'assaisonnement.   Ce fût un délicieux repas et j'y retournerais n'importe quand pour une autre délectable pizza Inferno ! J'aimerais bien y retourner aussi pour essayer une de leurs entrées, qui avaient toutes l'air bonnes aussi.

{"text":"Amazing pizza server aren't super professional but who cares amazing pizza I took with arugula. Bread served wasn't too great also but the pizza amazing"}
{"text":"My favourite place in Little Italy. The first time we went, I had just returned from a trip to Southern Italy and their pizza made me feel like I was back in Napoli. Afterwards, we came back to try the pasta and again it was perfect! Authentic, good prices, very good service. What else do you need?"}
{"text":"The worst dining experiences we had while in Montreal. The food was terrible the lasagna sauce tasted like it came out of a can, the red wine we ordered was cold like it sat in the fridge. Ordered a pizza with speck, it was very greasy and as I've had it before in Italy with chopped speck on it , this was covered in long greasy slices of speck. was told later that this is not a place locals frequent and that it is mostly tourists...nothing Italian about it .I went back and changed this to a 2 as the waiter was nice, but still expensive for what you are getting"}
{"text":"After going to three restaurants in little Italy only to discover they were closed we finally stumbled upon Pomodoro. The food was excellent, the staff were attentive and pleasant and the atmosphere was cozy and sophisticated. I would absolutely recommend this place for an Italian meal. Excellent."}
{"text":"Pizza is not the same across the board. A frozen pizza is not the same as a fancy Italian restaurant pizza. Ristorante Pomodoro does an excellent job of putting every other kind of pizza to shame by showing how great they can make it. We ordered the Carmelita and I'm pretty sure it was delivered from heaven. Another person in our group ordered pasta and he too had an excellent experience. I'm disappointed that our server was not more present though. It seems she was too wrapped up in other things to refill our waters so I would definitely encourage the wait staff here to be more present with their tables. Overall, great experience."}
{"text":"Nice server, good pizzas.  The tout garnie was my favourite (we tried that plus the meat-lover & funghi). The best part? The pizzas are woodfire.   An enjoyable friday lunch."}
{"text":"Wanting some real pizza (i.e., woodfire rather than fried!), we tried this place to take away a couple. We got the Cacciacavalo and the Margerita... All in all, they were good, though we noted nothing extraordinary about them. The one thing we did note was the price... 40$ for 2 pizze? Seriously? For that price, you could at least put some gold or foie gras on your pizze!"}
{"text":"We have been to this restaurant more than any other restaurant in all of Montreal. In fact, since discovering this gem, we find ourselves inviting friends and family to join us here for dinner. And if it is summer and a beautiful day in Montreal, chances are you will find us on the patio, sipping cocktails and eating alfresco. But I confess, we did not discover this place on our own. No, our first time here was thanks to our dear friend from Tuscany who invited us here for dinner one evening several years ago. He said, and I quote, ''this is the best pizza outside of Tuscany.'' The guy knows his pizza so who were we to dispute that?! Not only is the pizza molto authentica and comes out of an impressive brick oven, the calamari is so good that one order is never enough for the table.  Having said that, I must agree with some of the other reviewers who have questioned the huge flat-screen TVs on the wall. I can't stand TVs in restaurants! I find them to be nothing short of disruptive and distasteful. Leave the TVs to sports bars! Restaurants should rely on pleasant music and artwork to help create an inviting atmosphere. Also, it is in great part because of the TVs that we prefer to sit outside when the weather permits."}
{"text":"Should have gone here before shopping for groceries.  Waiter extremely kind, even spoke English, recommended 4 different appetizers for light fare, the zuppa was broccoli, not so yummy, the assortment of fromage, crositini with pesto delightful.  Little space for too many banging bags, atmosphere hip, beautiful Sunday afternoon dining. Forget about parking, walk it."}
{"text":"Chaque fois que j'y vais, nous sommes très bien servis. La pizza est très bonne, tout comme les calmars frits. Très belle carte de vins italiens. Le propriétaire est toujours gentil avec nous."}
{"text":"Our waiter was friendly and helpful but clearly struggling to serve more tables then he could reasonably handle alone. The decor was chill but a little generic, and personally I think a nice restaurant is severely diminished by TVs playing sitcoms mounted on the walls where the art should be. The eggplant parmesan and the lasagne were both tasty, cheesy, sizable, not disappointing, and the bread was fresh and hot. Sitting in the wide open window in the summer breeze on St Laurent in Little Italy is always nice, and given that a lot of our favourite restaurants in the area are closed on Mondays this place was a lifesaver that kept the hungry kids happy."}
{"text":"Came during the Grand Prix festival in Little Italy. Very nice restaurant décor and the service was good. Had the calamari and bruschetta for appetizers and both were good. Calamari was fresh and came with a tasty aioli. The crab bruschetta was a little disappointing, served on top of a dinner roll and made with fake crab meat. Actually bruschetta on top of a toasted baguette is usually hard to eat since it breaks upon first bite; the roll actually held up through several bites so I liked that. For my main meal, I had veal ragout penne which was very good. Small portion, but pretty filling. Kind of surprised that an Italian restaurant doesn't serve bread with their meals, but I had my fair share of carbs already. For dessert, I had the Nutella ice cream which was actually just chocolate (not taste of hazelnuts or Nutella, at all); but at least it was good chocolate ice cream."}
