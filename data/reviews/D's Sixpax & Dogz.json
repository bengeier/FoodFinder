{"text":"First, I don't drink beer much -- but D's literally has 1000 different kinds, so no matter if you want Miller Light or some small batch craft, you're gonna be happy.   This location is a former Pizza Hut that's dark with TV's everywhere. Tables with old, random new paper advertisements. Great place to watch a game and hang out. Regent Square's location has some crazy Irish landscape painted on the walls. It's awesomely tacky, but I find it to be more cramped and busy, so we go to Monroeville more often.   If you're going to D's, get a hot dog! All beef ,Vienna dogs - good snap, no weird processed hot dog taste.  I'm one of those people that thinks everything tastes better with cole slaw on it. D's version is tangy and creamy. It's the perfect combination of traditional and vinegar slaws. My best guess is apple cider vinegar, ginger, and mayo. Dunno, might be wrong -- but it is SSSSOOO good. For this reason my favorite hot dog is the Mason Dixon (slaw and chili sauce). The chili sauce is slightly spicy, tender ground beef, and no beans. Perfect compliment to the cool, crunchy slaw.  I also like the bacon and cheese dog (who doesn't like nacho cheese and bacon?!). My husband LOVES the Chicago dog. He says the toppings (relish, tomatoes, pickles, celery seeds etc.) are exceptionally fresh tasting. All dogs come on a steamed poppy seed roll. So Tasty.   We've had a slew of appetizers here too --  nachos, onion rings, fries.They've all been really good, but we usually are going for a good hot dog. I do have a friend that swears by the pizza, but I have never had any.  Service is hit and miss. Sometimes you get somebody that really knows the food and beer, other times you get somebody who doesn't seem to have a clue. Either way, they are typically prompt and attentive."}
{"text":"I stopped in due to all the good reviews.  Boy was I in for a surprise!  This place mentions it's like an Old Eurpoean Pub.  This is the farthest from the truth.  It's a coverted Pizza Hut and you get that feel as soon as you walk in.  I had a famous mason dixon dog.  It was a roller dog with some canned slaw tossed on top.  It sucked and I bet I will taste it for the next week.  Had a couple draft beers and each one had that sour taste from a bad tap line.  The bartender gave me a bottle beer and it was scunked.  Nothing went right.  Was there later in the night and they were calling last call at 10:30.  Felt like I was going to get punched out by the biker bar tender if I asked for anything else.  The only positive was it was walking distance from the Holiday Inn.  Glad I could haul ass home from such a dump!  By the way..maybe they have a hundred beers.  Not the 1,000 they claim.    Have an IC Light and Sheets sub...you will be a mile ahead of the game.  Who knows about all the positive reviews...the place was empty when I was there.  The McDonalds across the street had more people in the drive thru lane.  Enough said!"}
{"text":"It's nice to get such a huge selection of beer without going into the city. We ordered the homemade chips, a bacon cheese hotdog and the popeye pizza. They were all delicious! The chips were crispy and flavorful, the bacon on the hotdog was good peppered bacon like you get from the butcher, and the pizza was also good. The popeye pizza had a little too much oil on it and lacked a little flavor, but for the price, i'm not complaining!"}
{"text":"I finally made it to this location for dinner and beer on a Friday night. This former Pizza Hut has limited seating, and we had to wait several minutes for a table at a relative early hour, although it was Happy Hour.  It seems like most of the crowd was local workers or residents with several larger groups; that didn't help with getting seated quickly.   Once seated, we ordered beer off the fairly good selection of drafts. I will say that it seems they only make the draft list weekly and were out of a few things by the time we got there; a bit disappointing.  However, the beers were good and reasonably priced at Happy Hour.  We ordered an appetizer, and then ordered burgers. Unfortunately, the burgers came 5 minutes after the appetizer, even though we had ordered them well after the app.  The server/kitchen should have spaced this out better.  The burgers were delicious. I wouldn't call them gourmet, and certainly can't compete with several other burger places in Pittsburgh, but they were juicy and had great flavor. The sweet potato fries were crispy and hot, too.   Our server was pretty good at the start, but she brought our check along with the food, and that was surprising, especially since we planned to drink more. We were able to flag her down to order more beer, but then she needed to reprint the check when we were ready to go. That coupled with the appetizer timing was a bit frustrating.  Overall, it was pretty good, but I'm not sure I would come here over some of the other brew pubs I've visited recently."}
{"text":"I always wondered what would happen if you took a Pizza Hut and try to turn it into another format.   I mean really redo it, not just change the name outside.  That's what they have done at D's and actually it's a pretty good job.  It basically is now a bar with a restaurant.  We stopped in and had some of the appetizers, they were good.  We will have to stop back."}
{"text":"This I my favorite joint to eat at. I visit D's almost once a week. Hot dogs are great, pizza is better, cheese steak rocks! The beer is simply awesome. The food is awesome (the Big Ben Dog was featured in Gourmet magazine as the editor's favorite hot dog), but the beer selection is why I go. They have several taps and they are constantly changing them.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great place for bar food staples!  This location was defiantly once a Pizza Hut. If you are a beer drinker , which I am not, you will be in Heaven as they offer over 1000 choices! D's offers a lot of great food to go with all of their beers. Everything from apps, calzones, salads, sandwiches, wings wraps, pizza, hot dogs & burgers. They even offer a kids menu. They have TVs all over the place to catch the Steelers, Bucs or Pens in action.    My two favorite things on the menu are the wings and the burgers. THEY ARE OUTSTANDING! The wings are very tasty and the burgers are big and juicy. You can get the wings one of two ways, dry rub and wet sauces. I like em' with seasoned salt and BBQ sauce on the side.  I have tried the \"Blues Brother\" and the \"Bacon Cheese\" burgers. They are both very, very good, The fries that come with them are just as good also.  My wife and daughter are hot dog connoisseurs and they both approve.  Service is always good and the food is even better!"}
{"text":"This place has changed!  I believe they went through a management change, and so far, it has been for the worse.  For starters, they got rid of their weekend Happy Hour - which is one of the main reasons I went there. Second, on a Friday or Saturday night around 9pm they start closing down the dining area. This kind of makes you want to leave.  Their food is good and the on-tap beer selections are usually good. The bottle selections leave a little to be desired. Old beers with dust gather and are never rotated. Seasonal selection is also limited.  You may want to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Chicago Dog was great, beer fries were better. And no doubt - A former Pizza Hut.   The garage doors in the middle of the restaurant are an interesting touch."}
{"text":"D's is really a beer joint before anything else. Because of the ridonkulous alcohol laws of the state of PA, you have to serve food in order to sell singles of beer. So hot dogs it is.   I am about 97% sure this place was a former Pizza Hut, judging from the architecture of the building. But no matter. They have done a great job transforming it. There is so much beer paraphernalia around. They've transformed a lot of 5 liter beer mini kegs into lamps and there are even signs plastered all over the bathrooms. If they had put a beer sign in the urinal for me to aim at, I would not have been surprised.  As far as beer goes, they have a very wide selection in numerous coolers in the center of the entire restaurant. They also act as a divider and keep the bar on one side and all tables on the other side. Pretty big selection here. I mean if you are looking for beer and can't find anything here, you obviously have a problem.   As far as food goes, they have a lot of different stuff. I stuck with the dogs of course and it was good.   Service was good as everyone kind of knows how much people like D's and are glad to be a part of it.  I guess this is fast becoming a Pittsburgh institution."}
{"text":"Food Hounds... Brimstone here and ready to tell you all about a GREAT time ready to be had in Monroeville, Pennsylvania!!!  You want delicious food... Got it!  You looking for beer... can you say between 500 to 600 different beers on hand at ALL times?!?  That's right; D's Six Pax & Dogz has a ridiculous variety of every brand of beer you can think of; forty-five on tap and twenty-five brewed locally in PA including an Amish beer!  Whoa!  The crew here at D's takes tremendous pride in their beer and use thereof by utilizing it to create awesome beer battered onion rings and fries.    One key element that everyone should know is that their Chili actually won 'Best Chili in Pittsburgh in 2011' - so it was imperative for us to give it a shot!  So... the Chili was damn delicious.  It had a bold tomato flavor with bite that quickly kicked in, as well as slightly chunky and seasoned meat that reiterated why this brew took the prize.  About four or five gallons of Chili is cooked in house each week for between two to three hours at a clip.  The Italian Wedding Soup was homemade and offered a rich chicken broth, little balls of pasta and chicken meatballs which were all uber-good!  We all loved the Fried Provolone Sticks... this was extremely refreshing as although I enjoy mozzarella sticks, the option for something trendy and different called out to us!  I'm impressed that they didn't go the easy route and opted to use provolone instead.  Another cool item on the menu that was outside the norm were the Dogfish Bites - tender and tasty bite sized pieces of fresh cod fried in Dogfish Head Beer Batter.  Flaky, and moist on the inside while crunchy on the outside, this appetizer was off the hook!  Meanwhile, the inclusion of a Spicy Ranch Sauce was BOSS with an assist by the special kick given by yet again; horseradish!  We all shared a HUGE basket of the house Beer Battered Fries that were deep fried in beer batter and FULL of flavor.  One of the best eats were the believe it or not, Chicken Wings!  Aside from being juicy and crispy... they were HUGE!  I'd like to know where they found the Pterodactyls to make these things?!?  We actually requested them plain so we could dip into the variety of sauces that were deliciously presented to us.  These wings were SOLID... no complaints here!  Our Sauce-a-nese was running wild!  The Spicy BBQ was insane and the BOSS of all the sauces.  I also loved the Buttery Garlic!   The Entrees were no less than impressive either.  3 Cheese was a killer dog with American, Provolone and Cheddar, while the incredible Dog Quixote was deliciously spicy utilizing that award winning chili, drizzling cheese and fresh jalapenos.  Both dogs had that unexplainable snap that means it is OH so good!  My personal WIN was my Texas BBQ Burger... a Ten Ounce 100% all beefy goodness, well done with this unbelievable BBQ Sauce that lent a unique, tangy slap to the taste buds as soon as I bit into this monster!  The size of this burger was ridiculous and while paired with fresh crispy bacon, bacon, BACON... lettuce, tomato and delightfully beer battered Onion Rings; just made this concoction of love the BOSS!  Kielbasa Sandwich was a spicy, salty, eight ounce kielbasa that was reminiscent of the kind you get at Polish festivals; very authentic and topped with horseradish and spicy brown mustard.  The Reuben (or Rachel) Sandwich offered freshly sliced corned beef and Swiss... awesomeness!    Just when you think you started getting full... the Hounds kick it up a notch!  D's Gyro was incredible... VERY flavorful lamb - cut fresh off the spit.  I really loved the tzatziki sauce as it was extremely YUM and made fresh here daily.  Unfortunately, the boys finished it off before I could eat too much.  Moving right along, the Texas BBQ Pizza was an intense fusion of flavor that reminded me of Hawaii for some reason, even though it had no pineapple; regardless it was amazing!  Perfectly grilled chicken, bacon, Mmm cheeese, cheddar, provolone and the mozz... that BBQ again cuts into the flavor making all the behavior insane!  A fun tidbit of info is that ALL of their Calzones are made to order, and they will add in whatever you want; just order it and they'll construct it.  I had the Meat-a-ball Calzone which was probably the best calzone I've ever had.  The meatballs were well seasoned without being over flavored, while continuing to be soft and moist; not over or under cooked.  I simply LOVED this soft and tasty meal in a pocket.  Similarly, the Sausage & Pepperoni Calzone had TONS of meat to satisfy and please any Foodie... most definitely would order it again and again!  I washed all my food down with the house Shangri-La Fresh Brewed Unsweetened Iced Tea which was smooth and not tart... until I added some Red Bull to it... it gave me wings!"}
{"text":"D's = Great Beer. No crappy watered down alcohol in a can (Coors) here.They have everything from local craft beers to international favorites. Their food is \"pub fun\" with a clever menu and a Belgium decor that makes you feel like you are in a European pub."}
{"text":"I love the selection here, and it's great that you can mix your own six pack. A good mix will run you about $20, which is painful for most people that live outside of PA and are used to buying beer at the grocery store. I haven't eaten here, so the review is really only for the beer. The employees are really helpful when it comes to beer recommendations, and they're more than happy to help you put together a gift mixed 6-pack for someone that loves beer."}
{"text":"Cute little bar that offers a tremendous selection of brews. Great for happy hour or just to hang out with friends. The hot dogs themselves are worth the trek."}
{"text":"New Ownership.   YES!!!  Same great hot dogs. Same great fries. Same incredible beer selection.  Same great service. What more could you want?  Lunch for two, with beer: less than $30.00 including tip.  Sure, it is the same great value.  Sooo, get off of your computer and head to Northern Pike before we, and everyone else,  eat all of the hot dogs."}
{"text":"We just found D's though it is only 10 minutes from our house.  Their steak & cheese is great.  I loved their pizza - thinner crust - if you are a fan of the big puffy bubbly crust, this doesn't have it - but it does have delicious flavor!  Service has been quick & friendly.  I love the old tables from Wendy's!"}
{"text":"D's Sixpax may be my favorite restaurant and bar. Has the best hot dogs, Chicago dog being my personal favorite. Gyros are great, fries are also very good. They have such a big selection of beer. D's sixpax claims to have the biggest selection of beer in Monroeville. The prices of the beer aren't\"t to bad. It's a great place to hang out with friends, family in afternoon when it's not as crowded. Atmosphere is pub like with a American twist. On a weekend night it can get busy and you will have to wait to be seated. Service has been good overall with a few times we to wait long to get served. If you want a good place do drink beer, watch a game, eat, or hang out with friends. D's Sixpax is the best place in Monroeville to do so."}
{"text":"Always a good beer selection on draft and bottles for a nice price. I never really eat here that much, but the few times I'm in the mood for a hot dog, this is the place I know to go.  The service is attentive, yet a tad disgruntled.  +4 stars for the beer selection and being a good place to sit with friends, watch a game, and enjoy food the 'merican way: fried.  -1 for seemingly inconvenienced bartender and the lack of much other than fried food on the menu."}
{"text":"I have been there three times so far but the trips were brief, enjoyed everything I ate and bartenders were friendly."}
{"text":"My favorite place in the area. I travel for work and this is usually my first stop once I get back into Pittsburgh. The outstanding draft beer selection in the city - and an amazing amount of bottles! They feature some of the best of the local brewery scene as well as national favorites (craft and production breweries).  There is something for everyone. The great thing is that all the staff has impressive beer knowledge - as well as being friendly and efficient.  And if the beer selection wasn't enough to keep me coming back the menu is amazing.  The wings are great. The hotdogs are wonderful. The burgers are outstanding. The sandwiches and wraps are excellent. And best of all the pizza is stellar!    NB - They have just undergone a name change. They are now Dad's Pub and Grub - but it is still the same place. There have been a few tweaks to the menu (mostly name changes) and the killer Italian beef which was my favorite special is now on the regular menu."}
{"text":"I was really excited to come here after reading the Yelp reviews, but after leaving this place, I found myself just going \"ehhh it was good. nothing too special.\"  To start off with, one of the reasons I think I left not feeling as satisfied as I wanted was because of the service.  It was pretty much terrible.  First we waited 5 minutes before any waitress even came to our table, and then once we were finished with our meal, we waited about 15min before the waitress came with the check.  We had to even ask another waitress to get out waitress, so we could get the hell out of there and move on with the rest of our night.  But anyways, the food.    The nachos were the best part of the meal.  I think the reason we found these nachos so amazing was the fact that they were heavily layered with delicious chili and cheese.  I would defiantly suggest getting them not only for an appetizer but also for your actual dinner meal.  For the main meal I got myself some Garlic wings.  I was pretty disappointed about the lack of variety of sauces at this place, but I settled and just got a dry rub garlic.  GET GARLIC PARMESAN! or at least some kind of buttery garlicy sauce to clog my heart.  I liked their wings because they provided you with the option to get the big whole wings!  Gotta love the extra little forearm of the birdy.  My sister's boyfriend got the tumbleweed burger.  It was a bit of a let down.  The fired onions that were on it were not fried the whole way, and the burger's excitement and taste was about as exciting as the desert the tumbleweed would've came from.  Maybe that is why it is called the tumbleweed burger.  But hey I mean besides the service, this place is a decent place to come if you are in the mood for some mediocre bar food.  I think they should get more wing sauces.  Also, a little better service wouldn't hurt.  I think I am going to have to come back again though; I am hoping for a better meal next time."}
{"text":"This place has become a new favorite of mine...come here at least once a week, great wings, hoagies and dogs. Not to mention the beer selection is pretty awesome...can mix beers for my pleasure....blue moon and dogfish 60 ipa, call it the blue dog!! Lol"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times since moving to Pitt. Even though it has new owners and the name has changed, it's still the same great place. Reasonable prices, even on beer, they always have a special. The hamburgers are ok, but if you want great get the cheesesteak! It is huge, meaty, and delicious. My boyfriend and I always share it! This place is exactly as advertised and always has good service. Great little spot for a quick bite and beer."}
{"text":"Really great place.  Good vibe, knowledgeable bartenders, and killer hotdogs.  Did I mention they also have 500 beers?"}
{"text":"D's Monroeville is a fantastic place to go for the best selection of beers. (Over 1000 bottled and 40 on tap). They always have a great selection of seasonal brews on tap. Beers are pricier than your average bar, but that's because you are getting a more quality product. You should also note that the beers are about 1$ less at this location than at the Regent Square D's.  Their menu includes fried appetizers, pizzas, calzones, salads, burgers, and of course, hot dogs.   Personally, I like their pizzas and reubens. The staff is always friendly and service is quick. They are most crowded on Friday and Saturday evenings and game nights.  With their recent addition of a half price (pints and appetizers) late night happy hour, I'm sure I will be going there more often.   My only problem with D's is that they often close early. Don't bank on this being your late-night hangout."}
