{"text":"Yelp has removed my review of this establishment.  For your personal safety, do not go to The Reef.  I'm sure this one will be removed as well, but maybe some will get the message before it is taken down."}
{"text":"The reef is usually a great hangout spot for my friends and I, and usually the staff is awesome. This past sunday I went in with 4 in my group. My server was Diane and immediately we were greeted with an angry hello. All she said after that was \"drinks?\". We all ordered a round of beer (which we had to repeat the name of at least 3 times) and waited for our drinks while she talked bad about another server on duty not even 5 feet from the table. We could hear all the f-bombs she dropped within those 10 minutes of our drinks being delivered. After that she hardly checked on us, and when she did, she wasnt friendly. I asked her for another beer and she mumbled something under her breath and asked me to say it again louder. So instead dealing with an attitude like that I asked for the bill, paid, and left. Nobody should have to deal with that when being served. Possibly the worst experience I've had at a bar and definitely my worst experience here. I'm debating whether or not to even come back."}
{"text":"If I could rate 0 stars I would. The manager is very disrespectful. We asked to see if they could turn one of the television's to different sports game, the managers response was these are my tv's!! Wow!! Very unprofessional place. I have never seen a establishment act so disrespectful to patrons. I highly recommend folks stay away from this place. First bad review I've ever given on yelp and that truly is saying something"}
{"text":"Pros:

Always excellent servers
Always good food

Cons: 

Shitty, clueless owner
Price increases

I've been extremely reluctant to write this review, due to the respect I've had for this bar over the last few years, but this place has turned into an utter abomination of what it used to be. 

Not only have the 50 cent wings from 2 years ago turned to 70 cent wings. Apparently the \"wing night\" as the owner refers to it, has been abolished altogether as of tonight: no reason nor logic to it.

I've never seen nor heard of a place completely alienate whatever \"demographic\" they were attempting to cater to. Give me $2,000 a week and I'll come up with better ideas than convict night or free homeless poker night.

For the sake of brevity, I'll end my post like this: stop coming up with stupid ideas like imitation fish bites and start selling wings and draft beer at reasonable prices like they used to be. 

Also, no real Buffalonian would ever step foot in a Steelers bar on Sundays for a $14 dozen and $4.50 bud light bottle. The owner should be ashamed of himself; that's if he really is from western NY.

{"text":"I was there this past sat.night for a birthday party. When the club let out i was walking to my car and heard a comotion.. I watched as one of their employees who was either on drugs or completley intoxicated harass the customers On the patio..she started out with two girls which. Both asked for her to leave them alone... She was in their face and totally abnoxious i dont know why security. Or the managers of that bar would let her conduct herself that way. When she was walking away from the original girls she was harassing...then a poor girl that had nothing to do with it standing a couple feet away got pushed and the employee knocked the drink out of her hand... And then rushed her... I witnessed 4 security guards hold her the customer down while that employee.. Punched her over and over..never once trying to stop their employee or hold her back... who had attacked this poor girl for nothing..  They held her down and didnt let her defend herself while there employee struck this girl over and over..one of thw mexican security guards i guess helpes his wife by also hitring her....Then after picked her up and  dumped her over the railing like a rag doll... I believe the woman on drugs was a mother to the door girl.. Because i witnessed her yelling thats my mom... Ya mom fuck her up... Either way i hope that poor girl is ok .. And to the owners you should be ashamed of your employees and security... If i was that poor innocent customer i would sue you closed.. So dont go here a bunch of thugs and women beaters..."}
{"text":"This place was an hour drive from our house, but it was HIGHLY recommended by our co workers so we decided to make the drive. They had a variety of flavors for both bone in and boneless (we were only there for the wings). The best wings were the bone in crispy parmesan garlic ones! Heavenly! The environment was very laid back and had more of a sports bar type of feel. The only down fall was that they had one server for the entire restaurant so you can see how service was very slow. However, I can't blame them cause it seems as if one of their servers flaked. They were still professional and friendly overall."}
{"text":"The wings were good, I don't feel like they were quite Buffalo style, TRUE Buffalo style. But they also don't have any disclaimer about their wing sauce, the options are confusing. Lastly, the service sucked. We were there almost 3 hours and saw our server 4 times. She didn't check on water, extra orders, anything. And they weren't busy. 

I'd eat the wings again, but I'd get them to go."}
{"text":"The bartender was really unprofessional, we sat at the bar and she didn't ask us how our food was or check on us at all, my boyfriend got the hottest wings they have and was out of water the whole time. If she just would have looked over at us she would have seen, I ended up giving him my water instead, which by the way tasted horrible. She was too busy gossiping about her coworkers with her regular customers to pay any attention to us. Let alone she was swearing like a sailor. The food was good but overpriced. Would much rather spend my money at Jolie's."}
{"text":"Best wings in town!  Great food, atmosphere and music. Highly recommend. I've been here many times and it's always awesome. Whether you are a regular, taking part in a special event or OTB it's the place to go"}
{"text":"Ewww, this place made my skin crawl.  I ordered a Bloody Mary and after a couple of sips I noticed a huge slimy chunk of something in my drink.  My friend ordered a beer and there was literally hard dry dark debri all over the rim of his glass.  All I'm saying is this place is GROSS!!!  Not that it matters past the disgust of our drink orders, but service was extremely terrible as well.  I'll never be back."}
{"text":"Worst possible service ever. They've been open for a few months now. They always seem to be short handed. Will be the last time I stop."}
{"text":"Server was AWESOME, food was okay, and owner was the worst ever. Called prior to make sure this was a kid friendly place and the owner said ya and hung up on me. We still went and he was super rude even then. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"The Reef 2 is a great establishment and a fun place to be when you want to unwind from a hard days work and have a drink, or if you want to have dinner and drinks with some friends, or play pool or darts, or dance and listen to great music. The music is limitless. The food is excellent. Very multi-cultural environment, staff is friendly, lots of t.v.'s for watching your favorite sports. The smoking patio is big and has misters to keep you cool. There's also happy hours, food specials, entertainment and karaoke on Wednesday nights. Great place to meet good people. Mark the owner, is a great guy and super friendly and fun to be around and guaranteed to make you laugh. I have been there many times and taken several friends and all of them were very impressed and had a great time."}
{"text":"Food so amazing, and waitress Nikki was friendly, fast, and so easy to talk to. Cant wait to come back."}
{"text":"Ever been to a bar where everyone is just COMPLETELY HAMMERED? You sit there and say to yourself, how is this staff still serving these customers? I watched one guy hold on to the pool table to make his way to the bar just to order another 32 oz beer. He couldn't even hold his head up. 
This is the liquor boards dream bar. They could meet their quota for the month in one weekend. 
Unless your a professional alcoholic that your main purpose in the night is to get so drunk you can't stand up, don't come here. 
This is not a place to have dinner, drinks or bring a date. 
Your main responsibility as a bar owner or bartender for that matter is to keep your customers safe. You should NOT let your customers drive out of your parking lot SIR. 
PLEASE BEWARE OF THE REEF."}
{"text":"We came in on a Friday night while they were hosting a car show, costume party and stein holding contest so my experience may be different from the norm. I will say that this place has its regulars and that was obvious even during special event nights. After 19 minutes at the table and several eye contacts with the server, I finally went to the bar for our first round. I was helped pretty quickly and told the bartender my story. She found the waitress and she stated she was on her way over? I don't believe it- I saw you help the tables all around us 3x before even acknowledging us- but whatever. The live music was AMAZING and we will probably just come back for that! The service got better after she realized we were ordering shots and beers all night and the crowd died down. The bar was clean and everyone was definitely having a great time. Kudos for the beer selection!"}
{"text":"I've never been to the old Reef and this is the first time I've been to the Reef 2. Pretty good time. They had live music. A Guy named Harley Davidson. Very Entertaining. Beer was cold. Service was good and the wings were great. There were eight of us at the table and the server did pretty well on keeping up with us. Off track betting as well. I definitely will go back."}
{"text":"Expensive!!! Not what it used to be. Takes forever to get recognized. The management always seems like they're above all the customers. It used to be such a great place. Now its dirty and way overpriced. Pass and go to Native or ATL"}
{"text":"Food is overpriced..and things are limited. I get that they have some kinks to work out- but I like to drink Jack and coke... and their Soda is still Flat!!!!!! Very unacceptable. I like the look though and will come back and update."}
{"text":"We went to this bar on a Sunday morning to watch some football. Sat at the bar and got our drinks right away. After sitting there for about 20 mins we were asked if we wanted to order some food. We ordered the fried pickles and some chips and salsa. We got the fried pickles and they were really good. Then we got the \"chips and salsa.\" Store bought chips and pace picante sauce were not what we had in mind. While we were eating and drinking we witnessed the bar tender talking on her personal cell phone and the waitress eating at the bar. I sat there without a beer for half an hour, we also wanted to try the wings but could not find the bartender or waitress to order. Finally just called the bar and asked the bartender for our tab. One of the worst experiences we have had and will never be going back."}
{"text":"Great happy hour and the bartenders have a heavy hand which is always a plus. None of this 99% drink and 1% alcohol when ordering mixed drinks. Decent food but that's not what places like this are for. Live music Friday nights."}
{"text":"This place is good BUT... they do not return your change. They do not carry change such as dimes , nickels , ect. The change they take from you BLINDLY, is PART OF their tip. Bartender admitted it last night after she charged me 11.00$ for a pitcher and the bartender tried charging 12.50... doesn't make sense .. no STARS..THE 1 STAR IS A LIE. YELP MADE ME DO IT."}
{"text":"Worst bar ever. Don't even waste your time.  Service is terrible. Wings are terrible. Atmosphere is terrible."}
{"text":"The new location and beer set up is really nice. 
I came an met the love of my life to have beers,shots & wings !! Now to come here to the new location is a great memory and experience to share. 
THE REEF 2 !!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ice cold beer and the most delicious boneless chicken wings I've ever had. Also great service."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. Other yelp users had said its family friendly but I personally bring little kids here but the place is clean and I loved the wings. I prefer really crispy wings and theirs are super crispy and lots of flavor to choose from. HH is a good deal. I would come back!"}
{"text":"The worse customer service
I've experienced. Such a classless establishment where customer service is the last thing on their mind. I have dined in several times at the old location and once now at the new location, they take forever to even recognize you once you sit down, and then act bothered when you ask for anything. I won't be back to this hole in the wall. I agree with all the prior reviews about quality going down. Not sure who the Man with the raspy voice is, maybe the owner but he should let someone else takeover his time serving has expired long ago. I'm going to predict they will soon go out of business unless they change the way they operate , completely."}
{"text":"Employees arguing at the bar....slow service.....slim choices for food and high prices"}
{"text":"This place has been our go to place on tuesdays for wings. For quite awhile we have had dion as our server and she is great and very attentive. But last nite she wasn't there and had a new server who was on her phone texting most of the time. And the cook was obviously taking his beer brake instead of cooking for the customers so as a result we finally got our wings then 10 minutes later we got the fried pickles and still no fries till after we were done.  The server didn't charge us for the fries but that's not the point. If all staff were to do their job then things would be much better.  Not sure if we will be back especially if they got rid of the best server they had dion."}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place! Every one is so nice the service was great and the food was even better! My husbands and have had the wings extra crispy with buffalo and we tried the bbq as well. The wings are perfect the sauces are so good! Mark is the owner and he was great! He came over to our table and he ordered a fish fry on his tab! The fish was so good! Such a good flavor and the batter was so delicate and light. The fish was perfectly cooked inside and it was juicy! We definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I stopped by for the first time last Thursday to watch football with my friend. I had seen the old location many times, but never stopped. The new location looked big and it was close to my home. Thursday night they had $1 tacos and I had a mug of beer for $5. It wasn't the beer I typically like, but it was beer. The tacos were good - not like authentic Mexican tacos, but they were close to 1978 Ohio house tacos that I had growing up when that is the only Mexican food we knew. Maybe nostalgic, but for $1 they are good. I went back Friday and had chicken wings. Maybe just a touch higher than I would like - 12 for $14, but they were excellent. That night they had a guy singing and it was nice. The service was good both nights. I had two different servers and both were attentive. I went again on Sunday for football and to try out the breakfast. They have a few specials, but I didn't know if I would be hungry for all of that. I went with the breakfast burrito with bacon. It was large and it was excellent. They had pints of PBR for $1.75. I mean it's $1.75 - it's cheaper than a bottle of water. As we stayed throughout the day the place really filled up and looks like it is going to be a Steeler's bar. That's fine, I have no team allegiance. By lunch time I ordered the burger, added mushrooms, and chose a side of steak fries. By the end of the night I had the burrito, the burger (which I took half home with me), four beers, two cokes, and spent $25.  If you like horse racing they have a spot to place your bets and races are always on. 

Given this place is close to my home, the food is good, the beer is cold, the prices are cheap, and the service has been good and friendly three times in less than a week I have been, this might be my new football hang-out spot."}
{"text":"I love the wings here. But that's beside the point. Lots of places have good wings. This is my 3rd time here, 1st was on a random Tuesday late--almost no one was there but I guess the owner had called a few minutes earlier for them to cook him something he was coming by. The people that were eating  were friends with him I guess. The second time was an afternoon, plenty of people and kids. This time was Friday and there is some live music going on. Apparently there is a club here on Friday/Sat with details. Anyway to me it seems like the people here always know each other. Here's the thing that I Love most about this place --THE SERVERS. Each time a different server has been SO polite and accommodating EVEN when i ask annoying questions about the menu. THE SERVERS seriously make this place stand out from the rest."}
{"text":"Some the best wings we've come across since we moved to Arizona three years ago.  You have got to try the Cajun dry rub wings and chips.  Great friendly service. 
Wings are a bit pricey but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"If you want some good wings....this is the place!! The cajun ranch dry rub is my favorite. I've also heard good things about the lemon pepper, but I have yet to try. The service was fast and our food was out within 10 minutes of ordering it. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"A good bar. Much better than the previous location. Fair beer prices. Good number of new t.v.'s. They have of track betting, but doesn't seem to be very active. Three pool tables, two dart machines. Staff is friendly and attentive. Haven't tried the good yet. Place is very clean. Looks like a good patio for smokers, I don't smoke though."}
{"text":"I use to go to the old location. 

Went to this new location over the weekend. It's your standard issue corner bar/ big patio combo that are a dime a dozen in Phoenix and the surrounding areas aesthetically.  

Like the old location GREAT food/drink specials daily. Plenty of TV's, does have a few pool tables and dart boards. 

But let's get back to the food/drink specials menu has a nice selection of food but like the old location I come here for the wings which are even better than I remember them. 

Drinks were cheap $5 you call it's and $3 domestic drafts this was on a Friday night too it's rare bars have drinks specials after 10 pm on a Friday. 

Only reason I gave it four stars is because it was only one bartender and one waitress. I would say it was about 50 people in the bar which is too many people for only one bartender and one waitress to handle. Petty I know. But I can see how folks would down rate it due to slow service which I did experience at times.  

The crowd is nothing like the old location. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"The owner is an inconsiderate overt racist. Also the prices are very high. If you want the best wings go to ATL wings"}
{"text":"My second time to the reef was much better. I felt the patrons were very friendly and I was acknowledged by the staff as soon as I sat down even though it was extremely busy. Come here for a lively, yet homey neighborhood bar."}
{"text":"Went to check out the new place. Walked in, sat down and waited 10 mins. Not one person acknowledged us. We are regulars of stadium club but wanted to check it out. Well, we'll continue to be regulars of stadium club. Not going back here. Our party spends not less than $150 every Friday.  Oh well, guess our money wasn't good enough."}
{"text":"New location, horrible service. A guy and a gal were behind the bar when I sat. I was there 10 or so minutes and no one even came to my side of the bar. It was dead there. When I left the gal was still on her phone and he was smoking."}
