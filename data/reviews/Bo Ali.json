{"text":"The restaurant was full of terrible smelling incense. I am still smelling it on my shirt hours later. The table tops were very dirty, which is pretty gross. I don't know why I stayed to eat there after seeing this. I ordered the chicken kabob. It was not fire grilled, similar to what another reviewer said. The chicken tasted like it had been boiled. The food didn't taste bad, but it definitely wasn't great, especially for the price."}
{"text":"Mr. Bo Ali is an extremely friendly and kind.  He gives a LOT of food for very low price - I find myself tipping more because I feel guilty of how low the price is!

My favorite food there is this slow cooked beef or lamb dish on top of rice. It is so tender and delicious.

My only issue is that they close so early sometimes 8pm sometimes earliejr. but its worth it - it is so good."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here on a whim, from out of town with a craving for.middle eastern food. After talking to the owner for a little he prepared us our plates...absolutely amazing! After we are out gyros he asked us if we would like some traditional hot tea, to say the least it was delicious. Very good food and the hospitality even better! :-) Next time.were in town we will definitely come by for more."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and always got the huge platter with rice, fish, lamb, beef and everyone eats out of. It's pretty good but not much taste except for the okra, the food is something you can't have all the time because it gets really bland. The customer service is alright, the guy doesn't know too much English and can be rude at first but gets better."}
{"text":"The lamb sandwich I first tried wasn't my all-time favorite. It was a bit dry; nothing to write home about. The next time I came by though, the owner told me he would make me something special, so I went along with it. I'm glad I did! 

The hot plate of tender lamb and saffron rice he brought out with the okra and tomato soup was the best meal I've had in awhile. 

And don't forget to try a cup or two of his Turkish coffee while you're there!

I enjoyed mine in the corner of the quaint lounge in the back, leaning up against a wall of pillows, gazing out the huge windows, and talking with him about his 40-some years of experience as a chef on a passenger ship.

Oh, and if you really want to get the full experience while also showing off an appreciation for Middle Eastern etiquette, take a seat on the floor of the lounge and eat your meal with your hands! Yes, it sounds weird, but where else are you encouraged to eat with your hands while sitting on the floor?! Give it a shot and tell me if doesn't feel oddly liberating! I guarantee you'll earn a few points with the owner as well."}
{"text":"As soon as I entered the restaurant, a disgusting incense inflamed my nostrils. My friend and I had to plug our nose with our fingers while ordering our meal from a Irritated host. Of course, for recommendations, the host recommended the two most expensive things on the menu and when we said we were uninterested he then recommended the third most expensive item. My chicken shawarma sandwich came with fries: however, it technically included only about six fries, which two were cold. The sandwich's bread was stale while the chicken was a tad-bit too cold. Also, the bread's staleness caused my shawarma to break entirely. Overall, this was definitely an unpleasant experience! My friend and I left disgruntled and still starving after the bird's size meal."}
{"text":"Nice place to grab some lunch. Had a lamb gyro and it was pretty good. Not the best ever but good stuff. The Baclava was good but not sure they make it themselves which is a bit of a let down. Owner was friendly and it was clean."}
{"text":"They recently switched owner about 2 weeks ago. Even though I am a little disappointed because I am a big fan of the past owner's cooking(best middle eastern food I have ever tasted), the new owner is also a great cook and the food is still super good to hit the spot. 
Lamb and goat meat are a must try! I'm sure they do serve the food on plates but since I like to eat with my hands, my meal was served on a flat baking pan for ease. 
The place is very clean and has a tranquility feel. The display of menu is kind of tacky but it's still decent enough for you to read. You can get food to-go or sit in. There is a praying/floor eating area along with booths. This is a good place to go eat with your friends due to all the space they have. Bonus: it's right next to ASU Campus(Sushi 101 plaza)."}
{"text":"The lamb is amazing!! Been here 3 times. The gyros were ok, the kabobs were better (very tasty), but, the lamb was ridiculous! Totally worth it. Plus, the staff is very friendly."}
