{"text":"We dined in and were the only dine in customers at that time. It was also later in the dinner service so the \"rush hour\" was over. So, we expected service to be fairly quick. But it was not.  It took over 20 minutes to just take the order, another 30 minutes for food to arrive. Basic cutlery wasn't provided, and a simple request for plates took five minutes.  The sushi itself was subpar. The cuts were thin, and many of the sushi were made like a child would make them.  I love sushi but this was probably one of the worst we've been to for a while."}
{"text":"Food was pretty bland to tell you the truth. Figured we would just stop by since my car was across the street. I honestly won't be coming back. I still have yet to find a sushi joint that I like here in the valley."}
{"text":"If you eat-in it is amazing here! Easily 4 or 5 stars. But when you order delivery the food and service get lousy! So spare yourself the heartache and disappointment and eat in!"}
{"text":"I've never written on yelp before but this is now our favorite sushi place and it deserves a review. We're locals and we've been here twice now for the ayce lunch ($20 is an awesome price). The food is great, the service is fantastic. The glasses are never empty, they pick up plates very promptly. The menu is awesome. Of the appetizers, you can't go wrong with snow crab or shrimp tempura, and I'd especially recommend the bacon wrapped asparagus.. It's phenomenal. Favorite roll is the paradise roll  -shrimp tempura with spicy sauce and ccoconut  - SO AMAZING. Other standouts are the ichiban roll (with lobster), the Johnny roll (I forget what's in it but it's wrapped in cucumber and it's awesome lots more great rolls but those are our faves. They even had our favorite Korean blackberry wine Bohae bokbunjajoo. It was a fantastic treat for my birthday. There's a particular sushi guy that has been there both times we went in, a younger guy who speaks some english, and he's awesome. My fianc√© is a pro with chopsticks and I suck, and he gave me the kiddie chopsticks with the clip, and we had a good laugh about it. Great food, great service.. You can't ask for much more. I've been recommending the place to everyone I know and wanted to extend that to everyone I don't know."}
{"text":"I frequent Sushi-Bay. The food is great but the Service is well below standards... specifically one of the Sushi chefs. Many times I've gone in only to receive dirty looks, sometimes not even a glance or a welcome. I usually sit with the other chef but even so I feel uncomfortable. This evening I noticed him saying things in his native language to a server and they both looked and laughed at me. I asked the other chef ( who goes by Jay and is a wonderful guy) if the other one doesn't like me.  He obviously wanted to save face and said \"he's just busy\". I felt unwanted even though only 3 other people were there. I will happily find another place that is more welcoming my business."}
{"text":"I like this place.Great food and good service!! I love paradise roll! Also waitress so nice (I think korean or Japanese) very kind. I favorite sushi restaurant! !"}
{"text":"This place has all you can eat for slightly cheaper than the norm but every bit as good as the other places around. They have the Paradise roll and its the bomb. It's consistently good. The one thing about this place is that the atmosphere is lacking. They use a cheap boom box for background music and the bathroom really needs to be upgraded."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Went in on a Monday night and sat at the bar.  The Chef was very friendly and made some beautiful rolls.  I read through a lot of these reviews and was dreading the service, but I was pleasantly surprised.  The girl who was serving was very nice, the Chefs were nice and the food is amazing.  This may be my new favorite sushi joint in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This place is small... Service is slow. And there's a particular waitress that really doesn't give a damn and you just know she hates her job.   Sushi presentation and flavor differ every time we come here. But the fish tastes fresh. Our favorite is the touch down roll and tiger roll.  We would be here more often if we were more welcomed."}
{"text":"This is our go to sushi place. It is always so delicious and fresh. Amazing all you can eat at a great price."}
{"text":"Stopped in from Chicago on a Friday night. Sushi was fresh and uni was yummy. Chase, the sushi chef is amazing."}
{"text":"My wife and I love Sushi Bay and have been going for years. Good sushi at a great price. Leave your 'sushi ego' at home because it is a small, cozy and convenient neighborhood place. It is what it is."}
{"text":"Wish I could give 0 stars I've gone to this place for 10 years now and have always had a good time until the other day when I was going to meet up with some friends and I decided to bring the family. We arrived around 1:30 in the afternoon I walk in and see my friends say hi and I wait to be seated like always. The waitress finally comes over and says they can't help us and that they were too busy as I look around and see the entire sushi bar was empty and they had 3 tables empty I ask the lady can we just have a seat and she told me and my family we would have to wait outside and wait for someone  to leave before we come back in. This was the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I have ever had I will NEVER RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE. I will never go back even tho they had good food it's a shame to loose business but it's their loss. How can you say your too busy when your only half full and be rude at the same time ?"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi spot in Vegas. Great price for all you can eat (23.95 for dinner)! Pink lady and paradise rolls are my favorite. Never had naked sushi or friend sushi until I came here, Japanese lasagna and California crunch are amazing! I come here at least twice a visit. It's nice to get meal off the strip away from the casinos and thousands of travelers. The 10 minute drive from the strip is worth it- trust me."}
{"text":"absolutely the best sushi in las vegas - they even double charged me once ! but i still love them! i am a yum-yum addict! i crave the stuff. you guys absolutely rock - try the fried philadelphia roll and the fried california roll - make sure they put lots of yum yum souce on it! !!!!!"}
{"text":"One of the cheapest AYE Sushi place in town but the quality is really fresh and the chefs are friendly. Little bit out of where I live but worth the drive..."}
{"text":"All time favorite sushi spot in Vegas. I've been coming here for years, it's always my go to spot.   They have AYCE for 23.95 for dinner. They are usually always busy when I arrive but there's always a spot hidden somewhere to sit. Whenever I go I always choose to sit at the bar because the service is quicker and it's always fun to talk to the chefs while they are making the rolls.  Since their AYCE menu is so vast I've tried everything I've dared to eat and have not been disappointed. Their poke bowls are on point. You can decide how hot you want the sauce to be which is awesome. Hawaiian roll is also another favorite and their dessert selection is good (frozen cheesecake squares yum!)  if you are looking for a hole in the wall sushi joint this is the place to go. Try it yourself."}
{"text":"The food is great. We've been coming here for a few years. However,  the place is filthy. The chairs and wall all need to be wiped down. The bathroom needs the same."}
{"text":"Never disappoints. Even when I'm not craving sushi, if I come here, all of a sudden I get hungry! The all you can eat is reasonably priced and you get good sushi in exchange. My goto place for sushi in Henderson."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Looked up menu online to order take out. Had not updated their menu and many rolls were no longer available. I told the guy on the phone I'd call back with a new order. When I called back they didn't pick up the phone. WTF! Don't offer \"to go\" when your online menu is outdated and you are too lazy to answer phone"}
{"text":"This is the best sushi spot in Vegas and I have been to A LOT!  The ambiance leaves something to be desired, but they more than make up for it with the delicious and fresh food."}
{"text":"The food was great and the service even better! Good quality sushi and great bulgogi and mussels. Had a great experience and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I used to be a regular here and I can say that I will not be anymore. The rolls have become a gastronomic nightmare , I came for nigiri and sushi not rice , if I wanted rice I'd go to vons next door and buy a bag for 3.50 and save the hassle of going to sushi bay. Their uni is from what I could decipher a relic , it deserved to be in a museum it was that old , it was brown and smelled like a hobo that lives at the local warf. Their eel is never cooked proparlly its not crispy and hot like eel should be , it came out luke warm like it was shoved in between someones armpit and slopped on the heaping roll of rice. Sushi bay you have failed me for the last time."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE!   The service is absolutely horrible! Hell me and my friends always joke about this place as HEY guys wanna eat at sushi bay...?? *Dies laughing*   The food is okay sure...BUT the service is horrible...the help there.... talk bad about you behind your back...  Tried giving this place a second chance and the server walks over to me and says I remember you... EXCUSE ME....   Let me explain so we used to be super regulars and so on....until one day the waitress walks over and says I need to tip more...oh no its gets better...my bf ordered a water and he took one sip of my coke and she yelled at him for it! YELLED! Could not say nicely it wasn't allowed?  So a year later she still remembers us and calls us out... if we were not treated so bad we would still be regulars.....  Anyways long story short GO EAT AT KAIZEN!!! ITS SO GOOD! Our new fav spot and its amazing!!!"}
{"text":"I went late and had awesome service at the bar. I recommend two rolls, which are the Bonzai and Paradise roll. Both were great. They also have two flat screen TV's above the bar where you can watch sports. Awesome place and awesome staff."}
{"text":"Great little quiet place. The Romeo roll and Jalepeno roll alone are worth going for! Great service, very friendly staff. 21.99 for all you can eat dinner, need I say more!?!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would. Service was horrible server never check on us and had to wait for a  long time just to get water refilled. When I got the a refill she gave me room temperature water. When I asked for ice she told me to wait. WHAT THE HELL IS THAT. The deep fried sushi was terrible, it was way too hard and the chef was RUDE ( the tallest guy there). I will never go back there again!!!!! This Place is garbage !!!! I will would never recommend anybody to go there."}
{"text":"The sushi was delicious and the service was wonderful. The best little restaurant I've been to, would return again."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place. Came here with a friend and I have been hooked to since then. The restauranr is small and cozy. The sushi chef's and waitresses are really nice. When I come here I always get the seaweed salad and veggie tempura. The tuna poke is good as well. I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Discovered this place after moving from Vancouver seven days ago and have been there twice! First it's a small, cute and comfortable sushi place right near the Starbucks at Coxwell and Plains and the staff are very lovely and kind. The sushi is very fresh and delicious and the prices are excellent. My favourite so far is the spicy salmon roll, the unagi nigiri and the salmon sashimi - all excellent and great flavour. They have a great deal on 3 classic sushi rolls for $12.99 which is a great price and 3 hand rolls for $5.99 so you can eat a lot and not have to spend a lot of money, yet not have to eat your weight in sushi like an all  you can eat. For me this place is perfect and I'll be back again and again."}
{"text":"The stipulations on AYCES are marked by a double asterisk indicating \"one order per customer\" ...for the record, the baked green muscles aren't marked! Meaning I can order as many as I want, Mr. Grumpy Sushi Man. After reiterating this item wasn't marked he insisted I was wrong and wouldn't give us another order. The younger Sushi Man was nice though. The food is decent but there's better spots around town. I won't be back. Spend your money on AYCES where you can actually order all the things you want to eat."}
{"text":"My boyfriend, friends, and I usually always come here for AYCE sushi and have been for a couple years. The sushi is bomb but the service is the reason for the two stars. DO NOT go in there when the older lady is working. She's terrible service and gives this place a bad name! She took 10 mins to give us water and plates and they were not busy. She filled the drink order for the table next to us who had just sat down before finally bringing us our drinks. She tried to have my boyfriend change his top amount cause she didn't feel it was enough... COMPLETELY DISRESPECTFUL! I refuse to go eat here when this old woman is working."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and my favorite spot to get sushi in Henderson. They could work on their customer service, but they are quick and the fish is fresh. The AYCE is a good price and the chef always comes and says hi to us. There is usually not many more people in there, so that worried me a bit, but we also usually go pretty late at night. However, I like the laid back vibe and small quarters. They sometimes have special rolls posted on the wall and we tried them once,  SO GOOD. Try them! Their menu is huge, and everything is included in the AYCE."}
{"text":"My family and I have eaten in the restaurant once, and had an enjoyable meal. The service and staff were good, and so was the food. I mostly order takeout from here, and am always surprised and impressed by the fact that they don't skimp on portion sizes. Really nice to know there's a reliable, decent sushi restaurant in this area - saves me a lot of driving time when we're in the mood for Japanese, but too lazy to drive to our favorite places."}
{"text":"This place is great!  We just had dinner there.  The service was so friendly and fast.  The food was incredible!  The highlights of the meal were the baked mussels and the Phoenix roll. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Very delicious.  I really found this place to be one of the better sushi joints in Las Vegas.  Always very friendly and the sushi is high quality.  Would recommend. Definitely try the \"Wet Dream\"  different but very delish.  Alex did a wonderful job as our sushi chef"}
{"text":"Worst AYCE sushi I've experienced in the Las Vegas area. Don't see why there are so many positive reviews. Nigiri was terrible quality- tuna and yellowtail to be specific. Also ordered scallops. Ordered a couple rolls also very bland with little taste and the cream cheese tasted rotten in my Philadelphia roll. The waitress had the nerve to say that if I didn't finish it I would be charged extra. Don't be fooled by the reviews this place is awful and the people were extremely rude. Do yourself a favor and head over to Sushi House Goyeman blows this place out of the water. Or Yama or Sakana for other solid options. Just avoid this place if you like good nigiri."}
{"text":"I've dined in at sushi bay and also order take out many times as it's is the closest Japanese restaurant in the neighbourhood. I usually just order sushi rolls which are so delicious. They are a good medium-large size and they are not cheap on the sashimi in the rolls. There is a good portion in there. I've tried the bento boxes before which they don't actually offer a lot of meat for your main. They also only come with 4 sushi rolls opposed to usually 6 rolls at most Japanese restaurants. This is why I usually opt for the 3 types of sushi rolls for $12.99. Note that the free california rolls advertised on their take out menu is no longer a valid promotion and even though they advertise 10% off cash take out orders they didn't allow it."}
{"text":"My personal favorite sushi in this town!  All you can eat is well worth it.  The specials are always worth a try (Kiss of Fire should make it on the full time menu!!).  Service is never anything but attentive even when super busy.  Last but most important food quality is fantastic and super consistent."}
{"text":"I was a fan and a regular costumer here for 10 years. Today I picked up my take out order and when I opened the box I could hardly see any salmon of the spicy salmon rolls and tuna of the tuna rolls I ordered 7 of them and it is only rice and no fish at all. I saw new servers, chefs, way too many of them and an empty sitting area. Looks like the ownership changed and they are keeping the high prices and making the lowest quality rolls you could find in this town.  This was my last order there."}
{"text":"This is my favorite all you can eat sushi spot in Vegas! The staff is nice, the sushi is fresh and they have such a great variety! My husband and I love this place!"}
{"text":"My friend and I had dinner here the other night, the sushi was excellent and I love how you can have half rolls. I did notice 2 things and this is my first all you can eat sushi experience but they really packed on the rice especially on the hand roll. Also on our second round my friend and I were some what confused because we thought there was a roll or 2 missing but since we didn't know what it looked like we couldn't argue. After looking through peoples pictures on here they did leave them out. I wonder who's decision that was?   Also to the start of the evening we let the waitress know we've never been there and  asked how it all worked.  She gave a mediocre explanation and didn't whip out the lotto pencil to check off the item you want.  After coming back a second time asking if we've decided I said yes. And told her what we wanted she rolled her eye's and took the mini pencil out of the bottom of the sugar box. I'm not psychic! We still tipped her well but  I  won't be making it back there anytime soon. Not worth all the rice :)"}
{"text":"So since my last review- I've been here another 2 times and the service has been better. The irritable hostess aka \"dragon lady\" has procured a few more helpers and is now more tolerable. The food is good (slightly expensive for AYCE dinnerwise) but it is close to Henderson and sometimes worth it when you can't or won't drive all the way to Goyemon for sushi. Keep in mind that it is a \"hole in the wall\" joint and it can get pretty crowded and service can get slow (depending on how many waitresses they have/restaurant traffic). I would suggest calling ahead before getting there."}
{"text":"Food was good, thinly sliced, but good. Unfortunately, my one and only experience here was horrible. We (6 of us) were one of only two tables being served and ordered AYCE. The sushi chef did the normal greeting at most sushi restaurants, but didn't smile once the entire time. Our server did an okay job. Although, she reminded us that they charge or left overs. Are you kidding me? This ain't my first rodeo with AYCE sushi. Anyway, when we ended up being the only table left, the sushi chefs were talking smack about us in Japanese. I've never been more insulted or felt disrespected. Going back to Yama off Flamingo/Maryland and for good reason - It's worth the drive, price, service, and overall experience. If they food wasn't that good here, but the service was decent, I'd even give a better rating."}
{"text":"Horrible. We used to go here all the time but now there are new owners and this place has gone down hill. The rolls fell apart and the fish was sliced thin. We had ayce and the waitress let the plates keep piling up on the table. Never going back, so many better choices in town"}
{"text":"Great quality, service, location! Sushi Bay has it all. I live in the neighbourhood and this is my go to sushi place, not just because of it's proximity but because it is always fresh and very flavourful. I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I'm a frequent sushi bar hopper and this by far has been the worse sushi bar I've been to. Especially not worth the AYCE price which is $25 for dinner. I started off with Tuna Poke and miso soup. Tuna smelt horrible, don't even know why I bothered trying it. As soon as I tried a piece of it, it was so chewy and stringy. The soup was cold as soon as I got it.   Ordered a bunch of deep fried tempura sushi rolls, and as soon as I got them, they were over cooked and was very hard. As I was waiting for the rest of my rolls, I had to ask for my own water a couple times. They never brought out the rest of my order. I was already upset with my food at this point. The VERY rude chef always had attitude when I asked for different rolls and let him know my concerns, sadly he's the main chef in that place, why? I'm not sure, things need to change at that place and most of all, their quality of fish, needs to be fresh. Got up and left unhappy and dis satisfied with my dinner. NEVER AGAIN TO SUSHI BAY. I prefer Sushi-Mon, island sushi, I aka sushi or even sushi Ka."}
{"text":"Very fresh flavorful sushi at a great price. Half rolls which we love. Ichiban, sex on beach, paradise, and one with no rice and spicy soft shell crab(can't remember name) were all awesome. Our favorite ayce to date and we've been to a ton. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Let me start with the actual food was AMAZING. BUT I cannot decide what was colder the restaurant or the service. This was my first time here and i will definitely give it a second try given how amazing the food was and the price was reasonable. I work in the service industry and understand the importance of customer service. But if i get the same result the second time, the fact of there being bad servoce might just be enough to deter me from ever going back. Disappointing."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite sushi places to go to. Food is good, the chef is always friendly and welcoming. Just two things that i dont like is. 1. I went there with my family and my 2 year old he doesnt eat much. They charged me half price for giving him a handful of rice and a couple bites of seaweed salad? I know your not supposed to share but i dont think this is right. And second, i went another time and the total of my bill was around $90 , the waiters were making a big deal cause i left them a small tip. I can tip whatever i want. If you do a good service ill tip you right, if I constantly have to be calling you for things your tip goes down or maybe not even get a tip. Wen they saw how much i tipped them i heard them say. \"Wow really only $10\""}
{"text":"I really like this place as a lunch spot.  It's a bit small and can fill up with customers pretty fast; however the service doesn't seem to suffer a bit. Last time I was there, the bar was full and all but one table was occupied, and the staff still constantly made sure to refill my water and check on my hot tea.  There were also enough sushi chefs working that I never had to wait more than 30 seconds for the next thing to come out on my AYCE order.  I prefer mostly the nigiri and a few standard rolls so I can't comment on some of the speciality rolls they offer.  I also think the lunch AYCE might be one of the cheapest in town at $17.95.  I will definitely be back soon for lunch."}
{"text":"Went to Sushi Bay for AYCE, it was very disappointing. Their fish wasn't very fresh and their steamed dumplings tasted like it was microwaved. There were only 2 waitresses for the restaurant,  so it took awhile to get our check. I won't be returning here for AYCE."}
{"text":"Sushi Bay wow where i can i start. I have been going to this joint for 3 years now...3 years people....in Vegas that is a life time. You have to remember if a restaurant sucks it'll shut, especially sushi bars.   This is a great mum and dad style place, it can seat up to maybe 30 people, so make sure you get there early for lunch as it totally fills up.  The chefs always welcome everyone through the door with a loud \"Irashaimasu\", which is always a bit of a shock especially if you are in the middle of a conversation, and of course everyone in the restaurant swivel in their seats to see the new arrivals; and after the usual \"hello\" back from the patrons, everyone one turns back to their yummy sushi.  And finally in my long winded and slightly off track way we get back to the food.....oh dear god....if i had to pick something to eat for the rest of my life it would be their spicy tuna rolls...they are sooooooo good! All of the rolls are beautifully made and presented, the fish is always super fresh and if you get a seat at the bar the chefs will show you all the different uncooked wobbly bits of fish that they use in their creations.  They have the usual sushi and sashimi fare which are all totally excellent, but they have a \"special\" menu including the fabled \"touchdown\" rolls (if i told you what was in it, i would have to kill you!) and for those on an low carb diet, rice free sushi!!! Amazing!  What else can i say about Sushi Bay? The hot green tea, is fresh and constantly refilled by the super attentive waitstaff and the Edaname is fab with just the right amount of sea salt.  Go try it....I've eaten in many different sushi restaurants in Vegas and this place is defiantly the best. Great food, great atmosphere, great staff and all for a great price!"}
{"text":"Customer service sucks ass nowadays. I used to come allllll the time but I don't know what happened. Really sad. The food is also mediocre now as well. So sad about this place. I used to rave about this place to EVERYONE i knew and would literally pick them up to take them to this place. I think it's time that I find a new sushi spot."}
{"text":"Good food good value great people very friendly. Good value for the money. Enjoyed the Sashimi was good quality - tempura is great the beef short ribs as app or in the Teriyaki are great."}
{"text":"100% definitely 5 stars.......I just got back, I didn't get the waitresses name, but it was 3/20/13 Wednesday around 4:00 pm. SHE WAS THE PERFECT WATRESS!!!!!!!!!!! I took my daughter and a friend of hers who is a boy/man and we were all 100% happy...The food 100% The service 100% the interior maybe 80% But it dosnt matter it was clean and we felt at home.....The costumer next to us were having a great time too! Did I mention we got, ALL YOU CAN EAT SUSHI? $23 something (This is my 1st time at all you can eat sushi, Ive went to sushi places 100s of times though.) Never felt rushed, felt like they were happy to have us there....If you go I hope you get the same treatment and great sushi as we did.... Oya The AYCES menu has a HUGE selection and I was surprised how many choices you get sushi and a lot of not sushi stuff and dessert..."}
{"text":"This place is my new regular eatery for AYCE sushi as a local resident in green valley   The dining area is little bit small but enough to feel cozy with no tourists   Price is fair to food quality & rice portion in Nigiri and rolls, especially I like their Non-rice roll made with cucumbers and other appetizers   I did not feel super nice or engagement with servers however, they were quick and helped me well   The head chef seemed like he knows what he is doing and I could tell he kept checking all tables promptly and communicated with servers what each table was needed   So far I have visited here like 4 times over the last 3 months and no major complaints yet"}
{"text":"I was recommended this spot by a coworker of mine. We were talking about AYCE sushi places in Vegas, and he swears by Sushi Bay. I was curious because the last few places that I had tried hadn't blown me away in any sort of way. Even though I had passed by this restaurant probably a million times, for some reason, I have never gone in. Now, my thoughts have changed, and I am a Sushi Bay believer.  I've tried a little bit of everything on the menu. Rather than talk about each individual thing, I'll just give you the gist. There have only been two places that I have been too where all the fish and seafood from start to finish has been completely fresh. Number 1 is Goyemon. Number 2 is Sushi Bay. All the nigiri was very fresh across the board, no weird off flavors or textures. The rice was very good as well, just the right texture and temperature. I liked all the apps as well, they were simple but well prepared. If you do go there, I would also recommend trying out the Cherry Blossom, a marvel of avocado, crab, and goodness. They also have yaki-udon, which I haven't seen on a lot of AYCE sushi menus, and it tasted good. The only minor complaint was I thought the salmon skin was a bit too chewy for my taste, but nothing to take a star off or anything. The server was nice and attentive, and the sushi chef was friendly.  This place was very suprising. I've recently heard that Goyemon has changed a lot since my last visit, with a major turnover in staff, so this will probably be my go-to AYCE sushi spot in Vegas. Everything across the board was very good. From top to bottom, I can't find any major complaints about this place."}
{"text":"This is our go to all-you-can-eat sushi place. The fish is fresh and delicious, the selection is broad, and the price is reasonable."}
{"text":"My wife and I recently discovered this place.  The guy making the food asked us if we were spontaneous, we said yes, he asked if we are allergic to anything, then he started making us rolls without knowing what we liked.  It was she of the best sushi we ever had.  He also made a very unique veggie roll that me wife says was to die for.  Jyn (pronounced June) was the name of our guy, he was a master at his craft, fast too.   It's small and cozy, which we liked.  I took some to go spicy rolls but let him craft it his way and I was not disappointed."}
{"text":"The Paradise roll makes me feel all warm and fuzzy on the inside :) the service here is a bit hit or miss,  but never awful."}
{"text":"Basing this review on my most recent visit for a quick lunch. The salmon nigiri was fantastic and fresh as was the tuna sashimi. The prices were reasonable and the chef did a fantastic job. The awful cranky waiter was no longer there so they may have changed ownership. I will have to go back for dinner, but for now I have to upgrade them based on the awesome sashimi and nigiri."}
{"text":"Its a little hole in the wall but it is GOOD!! All you can eat its a good price and they have a good selection and great service. Totally recommend this place."}
{"text":"We have dined at many ayce sushi restaurants. They would of received 4 stars due the freshness of the fish and relatively quick service from the chefs. But to to lack of customer service, they are getting only 2. My son ordered a roll, after eating the first piece realized that he did not like it. After pushing it to the side the waitress comes up and says that we have to eat it. I nicely said that my son did not like it. And instead of just taking the lost on 1 cucumber maki roll responds with, \"well why did you order it then\" and forced us to eat it. The rest of our meal we were being intensely watched by the chefs ensuring that we finish all of the items we ordered....which we always do."}
{"text":"This sushi restaurant is very good.  I have been to a few of them here in Vegas, this is by far the best one I have eaten at.  All of the sushi is very fresh and the chefs are very nice and fast and good at what they do.  The all you can eat price is $21.95, lunch or dinner.  All the appetizers that are included are very good.  There are a lot of rolls to choose from the menu.  The nigiri is always fresh.  Garlic tuna, albacore, cajun albacore, super white tuna are the best in the city.  This place is very small and will get packed fast.  The sushi bar seats about 8 people.  The baked and tempura rolls are very good too."}
{"text":"Best sushi in town! If you can sit at the bar, the chef takes care of you... Hands down Long Island is my favorite roll. The baked green mussels are awesome too!!"}
{"text":"I went here for a quick lunch with a friend recently. It's a comfortable place and the staff were welcoming. The lunch specials are worth it and tasted fresh, I'll definitely be going back for lunch!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Come here for lunch all the time and now that we've moved near by for dinner a few times.  Here today for birthday dinner.   All you can eat is a great deal.    Sushi is always awesome"}
{"text":"Was in town for 3 days and ate here every single day! The new chefs are amazing. Yellowtail sashimi was bomb especially since they cook the collar after you finish the sashimi. Great price for AYCE sushi. Rolls were delicious...jalepeno roll, brooklyn, Viagra to name a few of my favs.  A must when coming to Vegas."}
{"text":"Right down the street from my apartment and SO delicious. Everything from their California Rolls to their Mango Mochi was perfection. I was stoked to see they even sold tamago, which is a rare find nowadays in sushi joints. Definitely recommend Sushi Bay!"}
{"text":"I remember the first time I came to this place. 4 years ago I just moved to this side of town and was searching for a decent sushi place. Henderson is littered with sushi places but the good ones never offered AYCE. I understand that but sometimes I'm just in the mood to OD on sushi.   Years ago they was offering a special for that time being of AYCE sushi lunch for $18.95. We took a chance since we didn't find any good AYCE sushi nearby. This place is literally a hole in the wall, being in the vicinity of a grocery store and surrounded by fast food joints such as Taco Bell & Dairy Queen. Don't let that stop you from visiting. What it lacks in trendy decor, they make it up with a good variety of sushi.  I always take and suggest Sushi Bay for guests looking for AYCE sushi. It's not expensive and the variety will make anyone happy. My sister is a diabetic and they offer enough riceless sushi for her and for anyone looking to cut down on carbs. Sushi is never formed with too much rice (like some other AYCE sushi places) and when I mean variety I mean the sushi isn't replaced with 1 ingredient  and is renamed.   I always coming when the \"rush hour\" is over for AYCE sushi. If it's too busy you can eat at the bar. I recently ate here for their lunch special too. Their lunch special isn't anything special but is priced for a quick healthy lunch. Some reviews complain about the host/hostess and to be honest perhaps they don't want to talk so much because maybe their english isn't perfect. Who cares though? I'm not paying to talk to them.   Will be coming back in the future just as long as they keep up the good work."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. I've been there twice and still have a lot of rolls i still want to try. The menu is extensive!  Both times I ordered the AYCE. The menu includes Soup selections, Appetizers, and even some noodle and rice dishes. The quality was definitely on point and they let you order half rolls which is good. The nigiri is really small, but no big deal. I will be back!"}
{"text":"This is just a really nice sushi restaurant in the green valley area. $25 all you can eat and the food is actually fresh. I always sit at the bar and watch the game while chatting with the sushi chefs. They will give suggestions when I run out of ideas and chat about my motorcycle while I eat."}
{"text":"The chefs are like a robots not even Japanese no personality the rice was not even Japanese sushi rice the uni was old every thing else was good but nothing great 7$ a bottle of saki was way too much but the severing staff gets a 10 out of 10 cute nice attentive and smiling"}
{"text":"This place is one of the worse non friendly restaurant me and my family has attended to. First off they are no kid friendly and very unwelcoming. I was recently there with my family and the negative energy we got from the cooks and the waitress was very uncomfortable trying to order for our kids they had problems with certain items we tried getting when the cooks started to talk in their language to the waitress telling her something and she changes her mood and she gives us attitude towards our whole stay there while we were eating. Luckily we just didn't walk out without paying that's how terrible the service was. Plus charging an automatic gratuity was insane when it was mostly babies there and only 2 adults!!!! I will NEVER come back to this place and I will be telling my friends and family not to come here at all!"}
{"text":"I've been going here since my freshman year of high school and always get all you can eat. I've ordered just about everything on the menu. The staff and nice and accommodating and honestly, if I didn't have a car, I'd walk here."}
{"text":"Its a-ok...my gf loves this place.....all because of their lasagna sushi roll. I dont really care for it.(She loves cheese, and this rolls has lots of warm gooey cheese)  The place is small, probably can seat  no more than 30 people. Service is good, the sushi comes out in a timely fashion. I have not tried the all you can eat yet, but the rolls I have ordered before were decent.  If you dont like the food here, it's right next to a Thai place, Dairy Queen,Port of Subs and Taco Bell!"}
{"text":"This place was terrible! The service was terrible, the woman pushed the all-you-can-eat on our party and they took so long to make the orders. Then they took the menu away from us and ignored our table for service. I couldn't believe it, then to top it off, knowing she gave us a terrible experience she automatically charged a %18 gratuity charge for a party of 5, smh!!! The food was ok so that is why i gave them two stars for that reason only, other than that, i will not be going back there nor would i recommend anyone i know to go back"}
{"text":"This place is my new sushi spot! Hidden little place with a good variety of rolls, sashimi and they have tempura ice cream!! Will be coming back again!"}
{"text":"My hubby and I have gone here a few times before. Granted sushi was good but always felt like being rushed to get us out especially this last time we've gone. Must I say that we got the lunch AYCE for $19.95 and we still had about 15min. Of our limit AYCE time and the chef/owner had asked us if we wanted dessert already not if we would liked to order something else. Now, since this happened to me couple times I feel all weird out about this place and I will see other options of eating else where, where we are not being rushed to leave...."}
{"text":"Love this place! Food always fresh, good price and the tempura ice cream at the end of the meal it's just awesome. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"This restaurant truly is a hidden gem. It was very nice to come here and be greeted by the whole shop as soon as we entered, and the smiling faces of all of the employees were very welcoming.  We ordered AYCE which was priced fairly well considering the competition from other sushi places around town. Our waitresses were very friendly and very on top of taking orders and keeping our cups full.   We started with house salad, poke salad and a crazy jalapeno. Everything was seasoned well and plated with finesse. From there we ordered Valley of fire, 911, ichiban, Hawaiian, cherry blossom, and sandwich rolls. Every single roll was made with care and true passion, it showed in every bite. I have zero complaints on anything we ordered.  Over all this restaurant was just perfect. It is a hidden gem that is going to become my new go to sushi place. 5/5 we'll worth every penny!"}
{"text":"It's a great place, very cute and the food is amazing. The staff is very friendly, she's always smiling. :) I'm not from Toronto and I saw at Yelp that it is a new place in the neighborhood. My husband and I decided to try anyway and we don't regret. We've already come twice!!!"}
{"text":"Good sushi place in a quite part of Henderson.  I thought this place would be packed during lunch but I was very surprised to find that I was one of two tables that had people at it.  The prices are good and the food was tasty.  I remember coming here years ago and it was the first place I tried sushi at and I hated it!  I have grown up quite a bit in 10 years though I must say and I truly did enjoy it here.  They have AYCE too which is always a plus!"}
{"text":"I'm not usually a fan of all you can eat sushi but I do have to say that this place has good all you can eat sushi for a great price.  I moved to Vegas last summer and this was the first sushi place I came across as it was in the same plaza as where I go grocery shopping.  It's not incredible but, for the price, it's pretty good.  The staff is friendly and has come to know who I am, which I love since Vegas has some of the meanest people I have ever met."}
{"text":"FOR THOSE THAT LIKE SALMON FLAVORED CHEWING GUM... I've had Krab with a K before but not Phish with a Ph (as in PHOOEY!) A group of friends and I went to The Ka on a Wednesday night and they were closed for construction so we Yelped for an All-You-Can-Eat Sushi (AYCES) place near by. Here is a prime example as to why you cant rely on a Four Star rating when there are only seven ratings. Of the ratings, three were from locals, four from visitors. We Vegas locals take the AYCES trend for granted, but most major cities don't have a lot of AYCES places. When a FOUR STAR review starts like this:  \"7 words...  All-you-can-eat-sushi-to-order! Wow.  Not the best sushi I have ever eaten but when it's all you can eat for $21.95, what can you really complain about?\"  can you really rely on a review like that? NOT ME! I can excuse the visitors that are enchanted by their first AYCES experience (And who can't? It's like the time you popped your cousin's cherry at church camp!), but I've got seven words for that reviewer: \"Glutton! It's all about the raw fish!\"   But it's the locals and those that call this \"the best in Vegas\" and \"high quality\" that leave me speechless. For the woman who has been going to this joint for three years (THREE YEARS!!!) here's a bit of advice: Get a date, have him take you out to another respectable AYCES place like The Ka, Sushi Mon, or I Love Sushi, and DISCOVER THERE IS A WHOLE NEW WORLD OUT THERE. Good God, it's like a Mormon who has his first Silver Bullet and thinks he's found the Nectar of the Gods. WALK THE TWO MILES TO THE KA and discover fishy yumminess. You could use the walk after eating so damn much!  Look, there are literally over 100 AYCES joints in Las Vegas, and they range between $21.95 and $27.95. There are some decent places in the $21.95 range, but hell, it's SUSHI, pay the extra few dollars and go to a GREAT PLACE LIKE THE KA!  The ambiance was the same minimum standard in the valley. It's a good thing I didn't come to eat the decor, because there wasn't any to look at, let alone eat. The sushi bar had 7 stools and they could seat another 30, maybe. At least the place was clean.  But let's get down to the REAL reason we are here: TO CONSUME A TON OF RAW FISH. Why else are you going to get so excited to eat at an endless trough for $21.95? If you want to just stuff your gullet, go to one of the Station Casinos' Feast Buffet for 2/3 the price and roll yourself home. WE ARE HERE FOR THE FISH, BABY!  Well, at least, that is why I WENT there, but I won't be going back there for the fish. My #1 marker for a good sushi joint is the Salmon, and my girlfriend (former LA food critic) goes by the Yellowtail. While the Yellowtail was passable (but still not \"good\"), the SALMON SUCKED. Wrigley's makes a much tastier chewing gum and it ain't $21.95, either. You know how good salmon looks, that beautiful orange color with as little of the white marbling as possible? Well, apparently they don't at Sushi Bay. Not only was it heavily marbled which made it less than favorable texture, but it had a lot of that brown stuff which is too close to the skin and is just out-right chewy. BLECH. Sadly, it didn't even have that good salmon taste. It was very bland and watery. And they are STRICT and annoying as hell constantly telling you (maybe even threatening you) that they'll charge you for anything you don't eat, so I got stuck eating 10 pieces of bad salmon. Grrrr.   The menu has a good variety of rolls, but that's typical for almost every sushi place in Vegas these days. The rice was mushy and they use WAY TOO MUCH RICE in the rolls. Only a few were passable. I never get Lobster Rolls in anything but the very expensive joints because THINK ABOUT IT: do you think they can afford to give you GOOD lobster roll for anything less than $20 a roll? Hell no, most places are using the lowest quality lobster just so they can say they have one. And no surprise here at Sushi Bay, it sucked. And of course they are going to suck, as the quality of the fish is rotten. Even the seaweed in the miso soup was chewy, not the light, delicate stuff found in good sushi joints.  Look, you don't have to take my word for it. There are six other people who recommend this place. If you've read my review and the others and you still want to check it out, I HIGHLY ENCOURAGE you to do so. And then come back here and mea culpa and we can go to The Ka together and have some REALLY GOOD SUSHI THERE.  Now, bring me a bucket!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of both rolls, nigiris and appetizers.   Rolls are good but you can do some half order and some not. Nigiris, oh no. TOO MUCH RICE!  and the fish is thinly sliced. Ugh.  Appetizers are good size. Ice cream? Why does it come in a plastic cup? Like as if it was pre-packaged.   Ehhh...I'd come back here if I was hungry and desparate...for rice."}
{"text":"This was one of two bugs that came off of the plates we were served. When I noticed it, I immediately alerted the waitress. She spoke to the manager who said \"we won't have to finish our food.\" The waitress then asked, \"do you want ice cream? The ice cream is okay.\" After refusing the ice cream that was supposedly free of bugs, she promptly brought us our check. To add insult to injury, our check was full priced. So not only did our plates have f***ing bugs on it we paid full price for the food that we partook in before we realized the BUGS on our table.  Yeah, that just happened. Any one who'd like proof of the incident can go to the uploaded videos to see one of the bugs on our table. I highly suggest anyone reading this go to a different establishment. Literally, any food is better than food riddled with insects."}
{"text":"Ordered a little bit of everything (chicken, fried rice, tempura, sushi, edamame) and the only thing that was decent was the sushi.  Definitely did not think the food and service was worth the cost.. Family of 5 and we left hungry and dissatisfied after a $70 bill."}
{"text":"The service and especially the food was amazing! So fresh and tasty and they gave us our substitutions with no problem and the service was always top notch and with great care and service. We were sad when our food was done because we just didn't want it to be over. We will definitely  be back and soon!"}
{"text":"This is one of my two favorite sushi places in Las Vegas. I have lived here since 2006 and I have been going here from the very beginning. They have all you can eat like every other place (they say they will charge you if you don't finish, but I have never had this happen).  This is not a place to go if you are not into a laid back environment as it is more of a family/friends place. The servers are great and leave you to your meal but the space is so small it is extremely easy to flag them down when you need something.   My only complaint and I always tell the manager is that they used to make their cucumber salad with shredded cucumbers but they have since changed to chopping them. It just doesn't taste the same, everything else however I love. I will continue to go here until I move from NV or they close their doors."}
{"text":"This was my first time coming to Sushi Bay and was skeptical at first because I only have one go to sushi place and have a hard time finding other good ones. However, this place was amazing. Awesome, fast, and friendly service!!! It's a small place but very welcoming for families. We brought our 7 month old and 3 year old with us and the wait staff was very welcoming to both kids.   The sushi was so fresh and quick to be delivered to us. We were greeted immediately upon arrival and when we left. We got the all you can eat for $23.95 for dinner and it was so worth it. All of are food was delivered fast but evenly spaced out so we didn't have too much on the table at once. They also give you the option on the all you can eat menu for half/full or hand roll so my husband and I got to try more. I wasn't a huge fan of the batter they use to fry the soft shell crab/rolls in but everything else I got was delicious.   If you are looking for fast, friendly service, with an atmosphere that welcomes everyone than Sushi Bay is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Excellent quality and flavor ! Service always in time ! Friendly and family environment! I will recommend to my family and friends!"}
{"text":"I'm usually the lone vegetarian at the sushi restaurant and ordering from a limited selection is something to which I'm accustomed. Well, at Sushi Bay, I feel quite welcome ordering just vegetarian rolls and probably enjoy their deep-fried sweet potato rolls a little TOO much! Yes, I realize I pay a little more than at other places and their finesse (judging from my veggie rolls) could be improved... But the service is friendly and since it's within walking distance from home, I can bring in my own container for takeout and therefore can enjoy a litter-less meal. I am always tickled when the hostess remembers my requests for no added provisions or utensils, which in today's time, makes me an odd fish."}
{"text":"First time trying this spot. Got a to go order, so can't really speak for in restaurant experience or much toward customer service. Called my order in, picked it up, and left. I got the Long Island roll, which has all my favorites: shrimp tempura, avocado, salmon and salmon akin, cucumber. Also had eel sauce. I enjoyed the roll. Similar to what I always have. Nothing to knock the socks off or slap your mama. Spent a very long time on the menu. The choices are somewhat overwhelming. Fairly priced sushi. Same as I see everywhere else. They also offer all you can eat."}
{"text":"Best Sushi in town!! The Chef always spoils us with great rolls. Friendly  service . I love Paradise  Roll"}
{"text":"This place introduced me to my passion for sushi and fueled my desire for more, I have literally gone to 40+ sushi place alone in Las Vegas and I still love Sushi Bay, may not be my #1 but sure is one of my top 10!  The place is warm and cozy, one of my favorite sushi place close to home! the food is always let me emphasize always ! great and the price is right."}
{"text":"I was so excited to see a new sushi restaurant in this neighbourhood and was definitely not disappointed. The service was excellent, everything came out at the perfect pace, and our server was very attentive. The food was incredibly fresh, especially the sashimi (seriously, that butterfish lived up to its name) and nothing felt sloppy or over seasoned. The price was great, especially the 3 rolls for $12.99 deal, and for two people who left with very full stomachs we paid about the same as we would at an AYCE restaurant. Will definitely be visiting again soon."}
{"text":"I stopped in here from Chicago and couldn't have been happier I did.  AYCE was only $23.95 for dinner and that included uni and even an order of toro! The place is small and unpretentious - a very laid back atmosphere.  I definitely made the right decision in sitting at the sushi bar as Chase, the sushi chef, was very attentive and engaging.  I was lucky enough to try a couple of his \"specials\" and, in looking back, I should've asked if they had an omakase option because I'm sure it would be amazing coming from such a talented and imaginative sushi chef.  If you haven't already, Sushi Bay, is definitely worth stopping by.  I just wish there was a place like this close to home!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars for the service I just received, I would. Came in an hour before closing, the waitress informs us that last call is in 30 minutes but that we're still welcome to order. My boyfriend and I ordered a few rolls, and not even five minutes later the waitress comes back and very rudely tells us that we have ordered too much food and need to leave. I have never been treated like this at any eating establishment and do not intend to return. I would recommend to save your money and go eat at Sushi Mon instead."}
{"text":"A decent sushi place for ayce.  A good fair price and clean restaurant with great service."}
{"text":"Horrible! Don't go to this place... with the new owners they probably changed chefs as well. They suck big time! Mochi was ice frozen... when we complained about the quality of sushi & how hard the Mochi was they didn't care. Horrible! Stay away from this sushi joint!"}
{"text":"I'm so sad that I have to write this review! This establishment used to be a favorite go to spot for myself and family. The quality, portions and service has declined gradually over the past few years.   The visit before this one should have been my warning. I fell extremely ill after having dinner there with my brother.  I decided to give it another try today and was disappointed yet again.   The salmon skin roll was so tough - almost jerky like that I had to swallow the pieces whole (They charge you for leftovers).   The tuna poke portions slowly decreased over the years but has been so tasty that it didn't matter too much. They must have gotten a few complaints because they added bagged mixed lettuce to the poke to make it seem like a larger portion.   I was so hungry that I decided to stick with cooked foods and they couldn't even get that right.   I've never been a \"race\" girl but I kinda took it there when it was completely OBVIOUS that they were treating everyone else different (better)  than me. The waitress went around 4 different times filling water and never filled my glass. The portions of food were larger at everyone else's table and not mine. I'm hoping it wasn't a race issue because we have enough of that going on in society.   At this point (because it really hurts me to give this review) I've decided to declare this as an off day. I'm not sure if I'll visit again because they've been so inconsistent. I really hope they get it together because their \"good\" days were truly amazing!!"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi spot! The owners and workers are always friendly. Their baked mussels and baked salmon are my favorites."}
{"text":"They definitely don't serve high quality fish. Not even decent. I came here and did the all you can eat which is 25 per person... there are other places that do all you can eat for cheaper and their quality is way way way better. It was pretty much empty save for one of the employees having lunch with a friend. That should've been a sign that this place was no bueno. Place was dead for a reason. Their cooked rolls aren't impressive, very mediocre. Their raw fish are so obviously not fresh. I ordered tuna and hamichi nigiri and they served me something that looked so dry and the texture was parallel to a pencil eraser. As soon as I put that piece in my mouth, I spit it out and the waitress brought me more napkins lmao. I also ordered the tuna poke which had dry ass tuna mixed with lettuce. This poke was disgusting. I spit that out too.  We ordered steamed shumai and the crazy jalape√±o. The shumai appeared to be the same ones you buy in the freezer section of an oriental market. It tastes like it had been in the freezer for years. The crazy jalape√±o was unnecessarily huge and packed with a stick of cream cheese and spicy tuna. It was disgusting. I wasn't charged for the food I did not eat because I made it blatantly clear that the food they were serving us was inedible. But still, the bill was $60. I wasted $60 on crappy food and ate unworthy calories. Not coming back here."}
{"text":"The restaurant is very small so try not to come with a large group. All you can eat is $25, and you can order anything on the menu (limited to one desert). Make sure you finish everything you order or they will charge you for the rolls you did not eat."}
{"text":"Got delivery from here twice this week. Really pleased with their roll combos, great price and tastes good too. Most places make you order from a few preset combos that usually have one good roll and at least one filler but this place lets you pick the 3 you want."}
{"text":"First visit to Sushi Bay today and not my last. Great service and a nice cute and  clean place. I ordered a small take out order as I was just on a walk. The veggie spring rolls were a crunchy goodness and the avocado hand roll was fresh and delish ! Definitely will be back  to try more from their fabulous menu."}
{"text":"One if the best AYCE sushi places around. Great variety and sushi is always consistently great! Great service and rolls are always out quick."}
{"text":"i used to go here all the time when i first got into eating raw fish. ordered take out for a sashimi platter and sashimi salad. the fish was not fresh and the portions for the platter were way too tiny for the price of $10. sashimi salad was a little on the spicy side. if you like sushi, you can definitely eat somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Really like the chefs here and the all you can eat sushi is a really good deal. The dessert is awesome, especially the mango mochi ice cream. The location is a bit odd and pretty small, and there isn't a ton of seating. We had five people and we had to sit at the bar because there wasn't enough table space for us at the time.  It's not perfect but I think four out of five stars is fair."}
{"text":"I FUCK WITH SUSHI BAY . I would come twice a week with my best friend starting our sophomore year. It's been 5 years since that time! Customer service good . Food good . A very comfortable shop located close to home. Every time I come in I feel welcome and I'm happy that the place is still in the same location and the sushi is yummy as always !"}
{"text":"BEST ALL YOU CAN EAT IN VEGAS. The quality is high. The chef's are creative, friendly, and informative.Once you get to know the guys they are really good to you. I've been to Matsuhisa, Suji No Hana and for lets see about 1/12 of the price if your lucky you can enjoy a lot of great food and walk out overly satisfied. This place clowns any other all-you-can eat sushi in vegas! And beats most the \"high end\" joints in town where you will spend 80.00 each. Granted you want to spend 250.00 each you'll enjoy more technical \"sushi\". But I'll guarantee you these guys will keep you satisfied until you ready for the 300-500.00 plunge!"}
{"text":"This place is new to the neighbourhood and I needed a late lunch so I went in to check it out. It has potential but there are still a few kinks to be worked out I think.  What I Liked: - I was greeted and seated right away and the staff were friendly. - The menu is pretty big and crab stick tempura was listed on the menu so I didn't need to ask for it as a special request. - The inside of the restaurant looks great for the area. - The food came out quickly. - The sushi rice was well seasoned. - The staff were attentive and asked how I liked the food and refilled my glass quickly.  What Could Be Better: - The prices of the rolls are not fair for the quality. I think the prices are fine but they need to make sure they are nailing the execution. - The yam tempura in the yam tempura roll was undercooked. - The spicy salmon roll was the kind with chopped salmon trimmings thrown in a bucket with sauce and a spoonful glopped onto the rice with a half cup of tempura bits. I much prefer a solid piece of fish. - The staff's children were present (which is fine, I know sometimes you need to do that with a small family business) but at times they were getting a little loud. If I'm paying $20 for lunch I don't want to play babysitter.  Don't get me wrong, though, the food was certainly edible. I will go back. I do look forward to seeing how it evolves over the coming months."}
{"text":"i was skeptical at first to try sushi in las vegas because it is in a middle of a desert. i was pleasantly surprised because it is really good and fresh. they have 20+ rolls to choose from, and the prices are very reasonable ($5 to $12 per roll). nigiri sushi about $1.95 a piece. AND they \"super white tuna\" (not albacore)..which is my favorite sushi fish.   the place is small, and quaint...a friendly neighborhood joint...seats 20-ish people. i will definitely try again while i'm here!  edit: if you're hungry, definitely go for the $21.95 all-you-can-eat. most of the sushi, rolls, and appetizers are on the menu. everything is made to order too!"}
{"text":"This is a nice little place. Fish is fresh and service is fast. We get take out from here often. I order the sushi lunch often. The rolls are a bit small compared to other restaurants, but the quality is good."}
{"text":"All you can eat is a great value. I have been coming here for years. I used to go more frequently because I used to work across the street. I've never been disappointed. They always greet you and they have impeccable service. Highly recommend the all you can eat; they have a great menu!"}
{"text":"Although the sushi is good, the service is terrible. Both times I've gone, I've had the same waitress who made me feel guilty for ordering more sushi, seemly extremely  unhappy and was very rude, and told me it was MY FAULT that one of the rolls came out with tempura on it, even though the description never said it. To be clear, I have a gluten intolerance and I can't have soy sauce, imitation crab and tempura; so the severe language barrier & rude nature wasn't very conducive to me asking questions about their ingredients."}
{"text":"Fresh. Fast. Delicious!!  Spicy tuna rolls were delicious, dynamite rolls and the vegetable tempura!  Will most definitely order from here on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Its amazing how a business can take your money for years and not greet you upon entrance.  I arrived with my family of 4 and we were not greeted for nearly 25 minutes and that was due to my wife intervening and asking for service. We weren't even given a glass of water throughout the entire process. They gladly assisted a group of 2 that arrived subsequently. We left very dissapointed. The server then deliberately smiled as we left the premises. As our family walked back to the car, i confronted the waitress and let her know it was f'd up how they treated us, specifically as repeat customers. The head sushi chef should be ashamed of himself knowing damn well he has seen me pickup food from the restaurant on multiple occasions. SHAME ON SUSHI BAY and SHAME ON THAT STAFF!!!"}
{"text":"They have good deep fried california crunch roll. I enjoyed it.!"}
{"text":"I do enjoy this place a lot, its a good bang for your buck. Its all you can eat sushi that also adds in a few hot dishes that are included with the all you can eat. Its been slightly hit or miss sometimes thought with the sushi. Sometimes its amazing, but others there are some rolls that didnt seem the freshest or maybe a few ingredients needed to be freshened up, but other than that I always come back for more!"}
{"text":"Consistently good service, reasonably priced, high quality. This is my favorite casual sushi place in the city."}
{"text":"Great sushi best all you can eat it's a small place bad service but great sushi it's hard to order cause it's not alpha bet order but good sushi hoe in a wall"}
{"text":"Should be advertised as: ALL-WE-WILL-MAKE-YOU-EAT.  Yes, I eat a lot of sushi. Yes, the sushi here is good. Yes, it is all-you-can-eat for $21.95... For that, you would think there would be more stars, BUT READ THE FINE PRINT...   YOU GET CHARGED FOR WHAT YOU DON'T EAT, INCLUDING THE EXTRA BITS OF RICE LEFT BEHIND.  I can understand that if you order like 8 rolls and leave several pieces from each, it's a waste, but that was NOT the case for us. Out of the 4 of us, 3 (myself included) ordered all-you-can-eat, so they were already getting a decent amount of $ from us. What we didn't appreciate is that EVERY TIME the guy came to our table he would warn us that we HAD to finish EVERYTHING. \"We charge extra for leftovers,\" or, \"We charge extra for uneaten rice,\" or, \"I told you we charge extra, right?\"   The worst part was, if he wasn't at our table warning us, he never stopped staring at us. He would stand at his podium and WATCH us eat. Then he'd go back to his sushi chef and make comments in Japanese. Specifically, he kept his eyes on me and it made me lose my appetite. He seriously made us feel like we were trying to pull some scam; it was ridiculous. Who wants to be stared down and made to feel uncomfortable while they're trying to eat? I've been a server and bartender for 5 years, and I NEVER treated any of my customers (even the deserving ones) the way the server there treated me.   I'm a laid-back person and I'm generous with my reviews, but this was, by far, my WORST sushi experience. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Even though the food is good the waiters are stupid and rude . I ordered to go and waitress refused to let me get a soda with that. Sure I could go someplace else to get a soda but sometimes a person has just had a long day from work and don't have time for attitude and just wants their food and drink to take home and relax . One time I came in and the waitress yelled out loud \"what do I want \". That was the first time that I came in . Yes the food is good but I don't know if the rudeness is a culture thing."}
{"text":"Decent selection of slightly better than average quality of fish. The place isn't all that clean and needs a remodel. Wait staff is very hit or miss. AYCE price is $21.99 for both lunch and dinner. Could do worse but ok in a pinch."}
{"text":"I ate at Sushi Bay several times before and their sushi is excellent. It's made fresh with fresh ingredients. Now, I've actually been to Japan and had sushi almost every day while visiting for 3 weeks. Nothing comes close to the original, but Sushi Bay offers a great variety with funky names. Unfortunately, the restaurant inside is outdated, boring, and the service is just ok."}
{"text":"Best all you can eat sushi ever!!! Try the Japanese Lasagna & The Philly Crunch Roll."}
{"text":"My friend recommended this place to me as a quick, small Sushi place.  I tried it for the first time the other day and it was pretty good. AYCE for about $23.95.  So far my favorite roll is the Sweetheart, shrimp tempura, crab meat and special sauce. When my friend ordered it I wasn't expecting it to be anything special, but I was definitely surprised. It's really good.  We didn't really get our money's worth on this trip as we only ordered about 2 rolls each, but I definitely plan on going back with a bigger appetite next time."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Sushi restaurant! The staff is super friendly, the food is amazing, and the All-You-Can-Eat prices are competitive. There all so many different rolls to choose from, that anyone can find something they'll enjoy. I highly recommend giving this place a chance.  P.S. Their yum sauce is to die for!"}
{"text":"My wife & I were coincidentally in the area last Friday noon & been wanting to try this place upon a friend's high recommendation. We opted for the AYCE but upgraded to the dinner menu instead of lunch because the items  (tuna poke, sweet shrimp, uni) I wanted to try were not in the lunch menu. The fish were sweet & crunchy and truly taste fresh. Ordering was simple & quick. Service was very friendly & hospitable. I love the small setting. Definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"This is a tiny sushi joint but very solid.  The servers are very polite and nice, and the sushi chefs are fast and skilled at their jobs.  I really enjoyed their hot foods, and some of the rolls are hit or miss.  The nigiri is fantastic, and the quality of fish is up there with many of the other sushi restaurants"}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place. I love sushi and this is one of my favorite sushi spots in Vegas. If you get all you can eat for dinner you get free hot sake! I would recommend going for lunch the AYCE is only around $18.00."}
{"text":"Anyone who didn't like this place has no idea what they're talking about. Been eating here since I moved to Vegas. I've tried all the big name places and the fancy, expensive places...but keep coming back for the freshness. Seriously, fresh and yummy (aka \"not dry!\"). $20 ayce for lunch and $24 ayce dinner! I've gotten all of my friends hooked on it, too and we now have to get \"a fix\" at least every other week."}
{"text":"I would call myself a regular at this place... Sushi is alway so fresh.. Great service... I've ordered a majority of everything on their menu.. My favorite is the Brooklyn Bridge and the Sun of a Beach... Just so good.. I only wish I didn't get full because I would eat those all day... I always get their fried Potstickers and shrimp... Yumm Yumm Yumm"}
{"text":"We have been here many times but tonight's ayce experience made us think about not going back there again. Food servers acted like they did not want us there. Felt like being rushed out. They missed a couple of our orders on the ayce list.  My last order was the dancing eel. It was not served to us yet and the waitress was already giving us the check. We felt like they wanted us out so we paid and left without getting our last order. Been in the food beverage industry for almost 10yrs. Would never treat my guests this way. Makes me sad since they have really good sushi. I"}
{"text":"Great place to eat some sushi. All you can eat sushi places are hard to find near Henderson. But this place has wonderful variety and priced well. We will DEFINITELY be back!"}
{"text":"Terrible. Sashimi was not fresh. Butterfish was cut really thin. Quality is questionable. Would not eat here again. Cannot recommend."}
{"text":"It's a good place for sushi and sashimi as their cut are thick and good quality. They have a good service and once I forgot my wallet but they trusted me to come back. The only 2 reasons I don't give a 5 stars is because once the fish was kind of frozen and because there is not much rolls variety for a 5 star. But don't worry, this is a great restaurant!!"}
{"text":"I would never come back here.   I ordered scallop thinking it was Hotate ( what they listed on their menu ) and they brought the crappy mayonnaise scallop.  The nigiri has way too much rice and way too much sauce, which is necessary to cover up the bad, unfresh fish.  Then for dessert, it clearly lists one order per person but they only let us one per table.  Ridiculous."}
{"text":"This is our local go to sushi place.  Staff are super friendly, food is good and prices are very reasonable given quality of food.  The short ribs bento dinner box is my favourite. The spicy salmon rolls are very quite good as well. My husband orders the rolls which are reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery.   The staff that took the order was pleasant to talk to. I ordered the party platter A and asked to change the California roll to a Unagi roll. she did it with a $1 add on (pretty cheap). She gave 2 free veggie spring rolls for checking into Yelp even though it's supposed to be for dine in. She took credit card payment over the phone.  Grade: A  The food was good. The sashimi was pretty fresh. The rolls were good. A lot of ingredients and rice was very soft. The platter was nicely arranged. The only complaint was the soya sauce seemed diluted or maybe it was the low sodium one, but for some reason It did not have much taste. Grade: A  The 3 star rating is mainly for the long delivery time. The staff told me it would be 45 minutes for delivery and it took 1 hour. I had to call the staff to check in on the delivery. I think it's a bit unreasonable given that I live 5 minutes away that it would take 45 minutes to begin with. I put the order in at 5:30pm on Friday. I know this is a reasonable time to quote, and I understand it was a busy Friday night, but it's unacceptable to be 15 minutes late when I live so close, and they told me it would be there in 45 minutes. The delivery person was apologetic, but this left a bad taste in my mouth. Grade: C-  Since the food and price is good, perhaps I'll try dine in or take out next time."}
{"text":"Very good all you can eat. Fresh, fast and friendly. Reasonably priced. I really liked the whose your daddy roll. Try it out."}
{"text":"Was on an errand nearby and stopped in to Sushi Bay on the recommendation of one of the local shop keepers.¬†  I had the lunch sushi special with assorted nigiri, spicy tuna roll, miso soup and a salad for about 10 bucks. I added to that hamachi sashimi, because that's my favorite (the fish on display all looked extremely fresh).¬† My meal was very high and consistent quality. Especially impressive were the little things. Rice, so often overlooked, was high quality and done to perfection. The miso soup was homemade, fresh and light. One of the best I've had in years.¬† Service was very polite, attentive and fast.  Satisfied and impressed, I'll be back for sure when I'm on this side of town. Maybe next time I'll go for the all you can eat special."}
{"text":"Great little place to enjoy sushi alone or with a few friends. & the Mochi is amazing"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden GEM!  Just moved to the area and the all-you-can-eat dinner special for $24 is amazing.  They don't limit the items, or pile on the rice like other all-you-can-eat places.  The fish is fresh and the sushi chefs are really talented.  I've been here 3 times in the past month and the baked green mussels and oyster shooter are the best I've had anywhere.  That means better than dozens of other sushi restaurants I've been to all over North America.  Friendly Staff and great food.  You can't beat that!"}
{"text":"Omg it was amazing definitely recommend I don't like sushi much but this place was AMAZING. Great service no waiting. Best sushi and clean."}
{"text":"I come here pretty regularly and the food is consistently fresh and tasty. This small, no-frills restaurant offers all-you-can-eat, but I usually stick to ordering a roll or two, plus a few pieces of nigiri. The prices are reasonable, as well (check the menu posted outside of the restaurant for the most recent prices). I would not recommend this place for large groups, but if you're looking for a quiet sushi restaurant in the SE part of the valley, this place is good."}
{"text":"New Favorite Sushi Spot Alert!!  We decided to try this place because we felt the need to spice up our Sushi schedule. We have three places that we alternate between and it was just time to switch things up!  I am going to warn you that when you pull in here and walk up your first instinct is going to be to turn right back around and walk back to your car. Ignore this feeling, I promise you the looks are decieving. It is a very, very tiny space probably has five tables and the bar, but I am telling you the rolls are amazing and the service is incredibly friendly and welcoming!  We opted for AYCE, obviously.   Our rolls we tried:  Screaming Orgasm Nevada Dragon American Baked Salmon Baked Wet Dream Tako (Octopus) Nigiri Dynamite  We also had Garlic Edamame, Seaweed Salad, and of course Tempura Ice Cream for dessert!  I cannot wait to come back again, and again, and again!"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi and the all you can eat lunch special is awesome!! Totally recommend this place. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We ordered yam and avocado rolls, virgin sunshine, beef ribs and chicken fried rice. The rice and ribs were great-4 stars. The yam rolls were mushy, kind of undercooked and lacklustre. Wouldn't recommend :( I really did want to like it the staff was so friendly."}
{"text":"My initially reaction was that it looked like a little hole in the wall because it's so small and cramped. I think there only has to be around maybe 6 or 7 tables each seating 4 people. So if you have a large party you would have to call ahead to reserve the table. But I have to say everything was delicious! My favorite appetizer was the coconut shrimp tempura and I really enjoyed the rolls. I can't wait to go back so I can try some new rolls. Great place."}
{"text":"So I've been coming to sushi bay for years! I don't know how I never wrote a review. Anyways, sushi bay is the best sushi I've ever had in Vegas. Like seriously. I could go there everyday. And they have my FAVE, surf clam !!! Everywhere else I've been never has it :(  and he's not cheap when it comes to his servings. Seriously. I love this place and tell everyone to go. They deserve a billion stars :3 now I want sushi. Shoot. :p"}
{"text":"OK. So this is my 3rd review! Yes I've gone back here, not because I wanted to, but because I had no choice because my co-workers insisted on coming here since we were on lunch, it was nearby, cheap and of course I was hungry.   Of course that \"Korean\" chef was there, the rude one, the tall one, the loud one, the one that stares and talks smack about all his customers. I try not to associate with the help there because by now, I know how they work. All I did was wait for my food and try to get out of there as fast as I can.   First thing we order, is the Poke. Mind you, we went there on a Thur and I guess that's when most fish arrive fresh that same day and the poke was smelly and stringy. Then I ask for Salmon Skin Roll w/ less rice and that tall \"Korean\" not Japanese Chef says NO, they cannot do that since it's a part of the sushi and how they make it. I tell him, oh you mean you wanna get your customers full from all the rice you put so they don't order anymore sushi? Then it's obvious he's taking smack about me to his people. I've gone to plenty of sushi bars that always did that for me and anyone else whom asked for it. Had to ask for water and napkins countless times. Handed the lady my Debit and walked out.   Of course I find out that I left my Debit card there, so I called there and I said I left my Debit card there and the lady who answered (CHRISTINE) if that's her real name, said yes it's here come pick it up, then hung up the phone before I can even ask any questions. So I called back and asked her why the hell did she hang up on me? she say's I'm very busy and have no time to talk on the phone if it's not regarding any orders. CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS??? I asked for her name and she hesitated and asked why? finally she said her name was Christine. LOL I'm sure it's not real. THIS PLACE IS A CIRCUS. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME HERE, I don't know why I even bother still coming here.   The 1 star is for the \"decent\" sushi they had that day, I'll admit."}
{"text":"Delicious sushi rolls, so-so service. And if you catch the main waitress on a bad day she can be really rude for no reason.  I highly recommend the Green Valley roll, that's my favorite."}
{"text":"Sushi Bay was just OK... they must have changed their menu, or their practices of how they make their rolls, I ordered several things that I saw from other persons pictures and what I got looked drastically different then what was offered which was a disappointment!   We were the only ones in there for quit some time, so when we ordered they didn't have any sense of time spacing, they just made everything at once and threw it at us and the table wasn't big enough for what we wanted to try!.  the bacon wrapped shrimp potion was comical... take a look at the picture... the picture makes the plate look huge but that thing was not more then 3x3  The tornado roll was good though, however the lobster roll was a joke, the only reason I ordered it was because of the picture, either they play favorites to regulars or they completely became stingy with how they make their stuff..   the search for the best AYCE sushi place in henderson continues! as I don't think i'd be putting this one on the top.."}
{"text":"So my girlfriend and I decided to go here while on our vacation in Las Vegas. Best decision for sushi in the area! Great selection of sushi, fresh tasting and the waitress was very tentative to our questions and needs. Would recommend this place to anyone visiting the area for their sushi desires. Will be coming here again in the future."}
{"text":"Our favorite sushi spot. Servers are really nice to the kids, fresh sushi, and good all you can eat prices.  It is a bit small, but we can always find seating no problem :-)  We have also ordered take-out a few times. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"The food was all right however, the service was weird.. Everyone looked pissed. NO ONE welcomed us or made eye contacts for good 2 minutes (out of one waitress and the two sushi men). They just glanced blankly at our direction. I felt awkwarded out by the silence.   The waitress (older Korean woman) pointed to a table so we sat there. We ordered something a la carte and two waters and the waitress gave us a weird vibe like she was pissed. The entire meal, she didnt come along to check on us or give us refills. She at one point got cranky with a couple that came in so they actually walked out. When they walked out, she blurted something out to the sushi men. Let's just say i know their language pretty well.....n what she said was not nice. I have  gone there a couple times n they actually talk smack a lot about their customers. Some customers seem like they come there a lot based on what i hear from the conversation. What disloyal people?? It made me mad.   I felt uncomfortable the entire time. Maybe i should have gone elsewhere when i first felt the weird vibe when i walked in. Another family walked in and out too during our meal. It was really weird there. I would not go back."}
{"text":"This place is for sure one of the best to get AYCE sushi. Especially, if you want good tasting sushi! The chefs are very good and even take notice of their usuals even the ones that don't sit at the bar. I'm lucky because as soon as I walk in the check starts making my spicy tuna poke! And as always it's delicious.  Even for those looking for the less pricey one the lunch time menu does not disappoint so I recommend them at anytime and eat all you can Cuz it's great."}
{"text":"Sashimi was good but portion sizes are really small. Very thinly sliced pieces. Tempura was consistent with other establishments. The soft shell crab was very good. Maki is not overloaded with rice. Food is decent, price is average at about $1 per piece but when you factor in the relatively small cuts of sashimi, it kills the value."}
{"text":"Just ok. Waitress was  not  very friendly. Started telling us what the rolls were but then stopped. Waters ran dry and had to ask several times before she refilled them with warm water. Asked for more Wasabi more than once. Didn't clear dishes until the end. Surprised by 18% gratuity on our party of 5+. They are very friendly when you leave."}
{"text":"Just love this place, I go once a week for all you can eat. Never a wait food is amazing and served fast. Really nice staff as well"}
{"text":"All bad...bad service...bad Sushi...never again...tell your servers to serve and stop watching the tvs ... :("}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service. Flow of dishes was good. Seemed that chef went heavy on the rice for Nigiri; which is not a deal breaker for AYCE. However, I noticed something really odd with the Fried Scallop. The scallops tasted off and looked like imitation crap meat. When i sent it back, staff confirmed that it was indeed deep fried imitation crab. That is very sheisty to mislead the customers and serve fake food. Makes me question about where else are they cutting corners? Hence 1 start rating."}
{"text":"Not coming back to this place. Bad service . Bad food and a little bit more expensive than other places. Don't waist your time and money in this place."}
{"text":"This place has decent fish for the price of an all u can eat sushi buffet. We were so happy that it was good and reasonable we could take our kids that love sushi as well but sushi is usually too pricey to go as a family for dinner."}
{"text":"7 words...  All-you-can-eat-sushi-to-order!  Wow.  Not the best sushi I have ever eaten but when it's all you can eat for $21.95, what can you really complain about?  You can practically order anything.  Any roll, any nigiri, any hand roll, whatevs!  It's like a sumo wrestler's wildest fantasy!  Great staff.  The sushi chefs are friendly and funny.  Always good to have a chat with some good peeps while downing some raw fishes.  They are also open til 1 am on the weekends!  WTF!!!  I dunno where in California you can get sushi past 10 pm!  Not only all you can eat but late night too???  Be still my heart peoples...  A definite recommend when in Vegas.  A little drive off the strip but worth it."}
{"text":"Sushi bay has excellent food and price is good. But their best sushi chef chase has left. Everyone else there is unfriendly and rude. They have all you can eat sushi for $21.99 If you order too many rolls they slow down the service and are rude even if you tip well. All the chefs are always in a bad mood and mock the customers and insult you in their own language. They always complain of working too many hours and then gambling all their money staying up all night. The food is great and the price is good but there are no customer service skills there!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place, it is my go to for sushi. All the rolls are delicious. And they have the best coconut shrimp! Most of the time it's not crazy busy, unless it's weekend dinner, then you might want to get here before the dinner rush since it's such a small place. Service is awesome as well. I have been here hundreds of times  over the past few years and I think I had a bad experience maybe once.  It's a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Hands down, best sushi place I've ever been to!  While living in Vegas, the husband and I made it a mission to try out every all-you-can-eat place in town, and we just kept returning to this one! Get yourself a 'Wet Dream' and a 'Cherry Blossom' and enjoy the flavor on your tongue!  We will be sure to return here when we visit Vegas! Love love LOVE this place!"}
{"text":"Had the three Maki roll for $12.99. Pretty cheap, but mediocre sushi. Ordered the spicy salmon, dynamite roll, and unagi roll. Spicy Salmon was not spicy, but had a good size of salmon inside. Im not super fond of such a simple dynamite roll as well (shrimp tempura, avocado, mayo). Unagi roll was just sub par as well. Everything was kind of bland and just lower quality.  Location itself is nice. Their wall of greetings is super cute. And every table has an outlet which is really convenient. The server was really nice and came out to refill our tea frequently."}
{"text":"This place was ok, very small for a restaurant.  I do not recommend the raw tuna roll as the fish is from Indonesia.   The tako nigiri was not fresh and we're smelly.  They do not love children, as they charge for sharing.  My baby is only a year old, and don't eat much.  I will never go back to this place or recommend this restaurant.  I highly recommend MAKINO's.  All you can eat sushi buffet."}
{"text":"This is my first sushi visit in Vegas, but I really enjoyed myself. Ice cold beer, hot tea, cold sushi, hot soup. Their \"chef sushi special\" was fun; I can't eat a lot of \"all you can eat\", but this was perfect for a sushi noob. It was a nice \"safe\" California roll that I could go to between bites of \"surprise\" rolls.  This was pretty much perfect for me since I've only had sushi about 10 times so far after deciding I like it as an adult. So if you ask me what I like...I couldn't tell you. \"the brown ones with the little red specks\" or \"the pink with the green and yellow\" are typical answers I might give you. So I really enjoyed this for exploring.  The place is affordable and low-key. Nice place for lunch and nice place for a chill beer and sushi after work.   I've never felt belchy or gross after eating here 3 times (and none of those times having any idea what the hell I was eating) which is a pretty good mark for me. I'll probably definitely go back when I want some cheap good sushi."}
{"text":"Based on the other reviews here, they must have been having a really \"off\" day when I decided to pop in for lunch. My companion and I were the only ones there, which in itself is absolutely fine, however, the restaurant was filthy. Food lay strewn on two tables and on the floor beneath them and there was certainly time to have cleaned up prior to the next customer\"s arrival. The woman there was too busy on her cell to take notice, I guess. While waiting for my food to arrive, one of the cooks used the washroom and when he returned to the kitchen he left the washroom door wide open. Certainly something I didn't want nor have to see. I asked the server to close the door for me. It took a very long time for my food to arrive, and not because I was impatient or  expecting a fast food delivery...my guest also remarked at the length of time it took for its arrival. Once it did come, it was fresh and 'delicious however, based on the other issues I experienced that day, I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Not bad, not bad, check it out.  OK!  If you are going for all you can eat sushi, then this probably means  you like the complicated so many flavor and stuff type of sushi. In this case, this place is just fine and you cannot go wrong.  1.  For a lunch place, it is perfect. Just the right size, not too crowded and roomy.  2.  Parking - Easy Strip Mall Parking.  3.  Car Wash - No, just kidding, but hey, you can drop your car off at the Chevron across the street , have it washed and enjoy a good sushi meal.  3.  Pricing - Just right at 21.99 all you can eat.  4.  Quality - No bad!  Now I am more of a traditionalist when it comes to sushi and prefer the basic Nigiri Sushi style with the seafood on top of rice.  However, I can and will enjoy the American invented sushi rolls and here they are tasty and inventive.  the Screaming Orgasm is very tasty and different!  I enjoyed everything that we ordered!  5.  Service - Just right amount of service. Just right amount of help!  Side note, being of asian persuasion, I am quite sensitive to the cleanliness of the bathroom. The ole adage is that if the bathroom in the Chinese restaurant is clean, the food is bad.  Well, here,the bathroom is quite good and the food is good. So, it is a Win-Win!!!  Check it out."}
{"text":"This place is a little gem, whole in the wall. I love to come here with a group of friends for the All U Can Eat. We pretty much have sampled almost everything on the menu and have narrowed down our favorites. We love the Mexican Roll, Pink Lady Roll and Spicy Tuna (with spicy tuna on top). The place is small but we haven't had a problem getting a table."}
{"text":"Not only is this my favorite sushi place ever, it is my favorite restaurant!!! We have made it a tradition to come every weekend because the experience is perfect!! The food is amazing, the service is always great, the variety is plentiful & the price can't be beat!! I am looking through pictures dreaming of going tomorrow!! Hubby's favorite are the Paradise roll & Japanese lasagna. Mine favorite are the Rock n roll, seafood salad & garlic edamame! Yum!!!!!"}
{"text":"A few of us decided to go eat sushi after pulling a super long day at work.  I've been here before and liked the food.  It was close so we said why not?!  It's a hole in the wall type place on the corner of Pecos and Warm Springs.  Not very many seating, however, every time I've visited the location, I've always been seated right away.  Because of the small floor, they usually have only one server at a time.  If there are big parties, it can take a while before they come to your table.    We usually get the same thing:  All you can eat for $23.95 per person.  Can I just say how wonderful of an idea that is!!  You get an entire menu, front and back to choose from.  I usually go for the side orders and if any sushi, from the Nigiri section I strongly feel getting your money's worth is important.  I don't ever want to be weighed down by lots of rice.  Here's somethings I love from the menu:  Shrimp Tempura:  batter is light and super crispy.  The dipping sauce is lightly salted and sweet at the same time.  Works well with the shrimp.  Teriyaki chicken:  comes in a cast iron mini skillet sizzling!  It sits on a best of sliced onions and Teriyaki sauce.  Love!  Bacon Wrapped Scallops:  Small little bite sizes of mini scallops and salty bacon.  Yum!  Sweet Amaebi Shrimp nigiri sushi:  Comes with 2 per order, per customer.  The shrimp is sweet.  Works well as a bite sized sushi piece.  This dish is served with the deep fried heads as well.  That was a huge surprise, not into eating shrimp heads so I was kind of grossed out LOL.  Soft Shell Crab:  The whole crab, battered, deep fried and cut into 4 huge pieces.  You can eat the whole crab.  The tangy and lightly spicy dipping sauce really works well.  Fried Gyoza:  Pork filled fried dumpling with a great soy dipping sauce.    Hamachi Nigiri:  Love this white yellowtail sushi option.  Not too much of a fishy taste to it.  Really good!  If you're ever in the area, come down and get your sushi fix on.  Overall, this place is actually pretty good.  I would definitely come back and get the All You Can Eat option!!"}
{"text":"Are you serious? This establishment shouldn't be open. I'm sorry. I'm a avid sushi eater and I'm very very disappointed with this location. I waited at the sushi bar for 5 minutes and when the chef returns he proceeds to making my sushi without washing his hands. This might have gone unnoticed if he didn't reek of cigarettes I mean it was awful. So wait you went to take a cigarette break and then you come back in and proceed to making my sushi before washing your nasty cigarette hands? No thanks. I'm pissed I should've just went to ( I love sushi )but I was trying to save time. Now I'm driving there now..... See my review for I love sushi it's actually not as far as I thought about a 8 minute drive from this place with wayyyy better sushi and staff. I'm not trying to promote, but like I said I'm an avid sushi eater and I would hate to see you yelpers try nasty cigarette sushi in a not so clean atmosphere when there's a bomb a$$ spot up the street"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. I used to like it but their consistency is not there. It used to be pretty good. Now unfortunately the last few times I've been here the food was different. The service was just ok. The fish was served on warm plates. This is a no no when serving raw fish. The attention to detail just wasn't there. It is as if they stopped caring. My cheese cake was frozen solid... really? Sorry but I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Okay, so I've eaten a lot of sushi at a lot of restaurants and this place is my #1 favorite place. Here are the reasons. 1. The variety - So many sushi restaurants just don't have that much variety. So many places have like 20 rolls to choose from and that's it. This place has at least 50! at least... 2. The imagination - There are so many combonations of veggies, rice, and fish. Other places have the same ol' rainbow roll or unagi with avocado roll. This place has amazing combos. the Dynomite is amazing! I've never heard of this anywhere! (The name may be the same but the actual roll is completely unique) 3. It's delicious - I haven't met a roll here that I though, ick or Meh.  I've been places and ordered the Spider roll (see the same ol same ol) and it be kinda gross like it was sitting there for a day. But not here, the food is all tasty! 4. It's not expensive - It's pretty reasonable! even the fancy rolls aren't expensive. 5. Pleasent atmosphere - this is where I would go for lunch with friends, not dinner with a hot new date and a Vegas show. All in all, this place is AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"In for to go again. For what we order and AYCE ends up being about the same for 2 people so we like to enjoy at home. Very friendly staff. Sushi has always tasted great. It doesn't look like much from the outside but we have enjoyed every time we order here. Trying a new roll today, but our staples are the California crunch, paradise and happy ending. I have never had a bad experience here. The waitress has even learned part of my order lol. Might not seem like much but it's the little Hingis like that that really make a place stand out."}
{"text":"WOW I found my new sushi place. The level of service and the amount of fun I had was worth every penny. And speaking of money the cost for all you can eat was better then I been paying at other places. Yeah looks like a little hole in the wall but it was truly authentic and the experience was outstanding."}
{"text":"The food is pretty awesome and the service is great..but the only thing is once they feel you reached you ayce limit they start packing the rice..can't stand that and for that you get 4 stars The price for ayce is great though 23.95 you can't beat it"}
{"text":"Went in for lunch, and am very glad I did!  Great sushi!  The restaurant isn't very big, so I decided to sit at the bar and leave the tables for larger groups.  From the moment I walked in, I was greeted, seated, and had my drink order taken.  I decided to go with AYCE, and was given a sheet to place my order.  The chefs were really tentative and had good timing for getting the orders out.  Everything tasted amazing!  The fish was fresh, the rolls were great, and they even let you order half rolls.  Not just for your last roll, but on any roll you want.  They have a great selection of specialty rolls, and nigiri.  The appetizer section has a nice selection, as well.  The best part, great quality sushi for $20!  The only downfall for me, their miso soup is lacking (and I love miso soup) Aside from that, I'm definitely adding this restaurant to my list =]"}
{"text":"My favorite place! Usually no wait at the restaurant. Servers are friendly and always attentive and the sushi is always fresh!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi joint in Vegas.  i CRAVE it when I'm at home in California and make sure to visit at least once when I am in town.  It's pretty cheap and very fresh.  Service is good.  Japanese lasagna- yum"}
{"text":"I love this place!  I've been going for years and the food is consistently fresh and delicious. The all-you-can-eat is a deal that can't be passed up on. The staff is always so friendly and very accommodating. I highly recommend Sushi Bay to anyone who's a longtime sushi lover or someone who's just learning what they like."}
{"text":"I really love eating here! The fish is always fresh, & you always know to expect it. Yeah- the presentation isn't elaborately crazy, but the sushi speaks for itself. It's consistently good food- without any of the unnecessary frills.  The only thumbs down I have would be the host that seats you. I don't expect too much, but I mean- a smile wouldn't hurt right?"}
{"text":"Try the Who's Your Daddy :) Its probably my favorite thing about this restaurant.  Service is just okay, nothing special. Sushi is about the same. Lunch special advertised on the outside of the restaurant isn't honored inside (weird)."}
{"text":"Went to have some sushi and it's a packed house. Normally restaurants  put your name down and give you a wait time of when you will be seated, sushi bay? Nope they lock the doors and everyone inside. Pretty sketchy. Now if it was a private party I understand but good customer service leave a sign up or just communicate with customers. Pretty disappointed. Heading to sushi wa instead."}
{"text":"I've come to expect slow service at sushi...it's very hit or miss here, mostly miss.  We used to go a few times a week for well over a year straight until we went once for 'all you can eat'...just a girlfriend and I.  We ordered 3 rolls, two salads and miso.  We didn't/couldn't finish 4 pieces...they charged us.  I get the rule and I'm fine with the rule BUT like I said we'd been going there multiple times a week for over a year.  We no longer go.  It's the principle."}
{"text":"Been here, was watched intensively by the chefs and staff, not sure what they were staring at. Mayb they didn't like my Jeans, or T shirt, or food choices, who knows, idc, But reading several other reviews seems that must be \"just how they do things\".. Eventually it will effect their revenue and people will stop patronizing the business if they continue to treat people in this manner. It's unfortunate that they have acted this way towards quite a few people, myself included. Have to co-sign in the disdain of considering a return trip...  Nope, too many other choices, I'm out........"}
{"text":"We always love this place. The price for good sushi is a deal. The place looks a little run down but that doesn't bother me. Today the service was a little slower than usual. I don't know if they were training someone but we had to wait awhile and there was only one other table in the place besides us. The main guy wasn't there today which may have been part of the reason. We will still keep coming back again and again and again and again. Until there are no more fish in the ocean.   Every time we come here we feel very welcomed. We not only enjoy the food but we also enjoy the service. Do yourself a favor and try this place out."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb. The food is good and good portions and good service. It feels like you're going to your Japanese second cousin's house they treat you like family and really add to the experience"}
{"text":"I had 5 pieces of salmon. They were so fresh, thick and buttery! So much flavor. The chef came to my table and told me that it was the salmon belly, that is what I shall order everytime now! Also I ordered the paradise roll, its my new fav. Its amazing, pretty genius. I've never had coconut shrimp in a roll, only shrimp tempura. The roll had coconut shrimp, fresh salmon, cream cheese, avocado, coconut flakes and spicy yum yum sauce. I can't wait to go back. They have one of my other favorites on the menu as well, The japanese lasagnia! Its really good. UPDATE: THE SEX BOMB is now my favorite! And when you do the all you can eat they do half rolls and give away free soki!"}
{"text":"Best sushi spot in Henderson hands down! I love that they have the half roll option on the AYCE menu. Some of my fave rolls are Wet Dream, Mexican and Touchdown! The Shumai and baked green muscles are to die for! The staff is always friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite sushi places close to home! The food is always good and the price is right. It is always the same two guys making the sushi and I really like that.  It is not a fancy sushi place but the food is always good. I like to call it cushi sushi because I am so comfortable there :)"}
{"text":"This place is on hit legit. The sushi culture has become so main stream and expensive that its just gotten ridiculous. When I eat sushi I want good rolls and fresh fish. I seem to end up going to places where things are average but the prices are ludicrous. Those places usually have the staff dressed up as Geishas and something in a traditional Japanese gi like a scene from enter the dragon. This place not so much.   It's small and never really crowded. Some people may look at it and wonder why but to me it means that they don't need smoke and mirrors to entertain would be customers. I dig sitting at the bar. The chefs will put on anything on the TV. It's a plus during baseball season because you can stuff your face for 9 innings while catching a game. Everything is good. I've yet to have something I wasn't a fan of. Then again if your a sushi person your probably down to try anything. My advice drop in with an appetite its worth the price."}
{"text":"Great find in East York and they deliver! Arrived early, great fresh food. Will order from them again for sure."}
{"text":"The sushi tuna I ordered at this place was rotten.Right after I informed the waitress that the sushi was rotten she walked over and spoke to the chief and they both started laughing. I guess serving your patrons rotten food is funny."}
{"text":"The people at sushi bay are my people. I get a craving for sushi at least once a week and they are always where my husband, sister, kids and I always go. The servers are amazing and always put plastic wrap over are kids cups so they don't spill. The food is bomb.com. If you're looking for a place to go and a place to call your sushi home then look no further!"}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical about this place just because there were a couple of bad reviews and I'm always unsure about trying new sushi places. I live down the street from here and it's always packed so I decided to give it a try.   It's a really small place. Maybe 6 tables and a sushi bar. My husband and I sat at the bar and went with all you can't eat. For dinner it is only $25 a person! Half a roll ranges from $6-$9 so if you're going to eat a decent amount, AYCE is the way to go. That is such a great deal so right away I was thinking this food is going to suck. I'm happy to report it as pleasantly surprised!   The food did not take very long at all, especially since we were at the bar so the sushi chefs just handed the food to us as they made it. I highly recommend anything fried - tempura, sandwich roll, etc. That was by far my favorite. The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because it's not the best sushi or freshest I've had, but the price and customer service was excellent."}
{"text":"I was around the area and decided to stop by. I must say, this place is one of the least expesive all you can eat sushi places in town and the food doesn't dissapoint.   The friendly head sushi chef recommended the paradise roll and it truely was one of my favorite sushi roll ever. It had a coconut shrimp with shreaded coconut on top. I'm normally not a fan of coconut but it went really well with the roll.   I alway base my rating on the nigiri's and I must say, they were nice and thick with little rice. I can eat the salmon all day. Definitely get your money's worth here. The server was extremly nice, always checked on me if everything was o.k. and refilled my drinks promptly.   I would rate this place higher than the other places in town and although I live accross town, the cheapest price in town definitely will make the drive worth it."}
{"text":"love Sushi Bay! It's a secret hole in the wall gem with genuine staff that make you feel welcome anytime...tuna poke is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"I just recently moved in this area. And when I drove by it. I saw this place and thought \"why not\" I invited a few co workers. Because eating by myself makes me sad. So when we walked in it was small compared to most sushi restaurants. But it was busy. And the waitress was very attentive to all the customers. The rolls were good. I recommend the touchdown roll. Will be making this my new sushi spot."}
{"text":"Went there on Christmas, thank God they were open. Same chef's were there, food is fresh and fast. I've been going there for years and it's always consistent. I'd definitely recommend for Sushi."}
{"text":"I'll definitely come back to this spot when in the area. All the rolls we got were great, the poke was delicious, service was awesome! It's a small little place and it feels up quickly. AYCE for lunch 21$ and dinner 25$."}
{"text":"Service was very unprofessional, the food was good until I found a hair in my sushi room completely gross!!!!"}
{"text":"Second time I ate there and I just love it. The all u can eat price is very affordable, people are super friendly. I can only recommend it ! I live very close and will definitely be back !"}
{"text":"Food was decent.  2 of us had the all you can eat sushi and one had chicken teriyaki dinner.  Nothing really stands out here, except the service could have been better.  Again nothing terrible, just slow and we had an issue at the check time because one of us left the rice from two pieces of sushi and we tried a roll that neither one of us liked.  I understand that they don't want people taking advantage of the \"all you can eat\" price, but I think this place was a bit extreme.  I paid separately for the roll we ordered that we didn't like, which seemed like the best option to get the waitress to stop getting upset and explaining the all you can eat policy over and over.  So for 3 of us with 2 beers and a soda, the bill was $105 plus the $10 for the uneaten roll."}
{"text":"Called to place an order to be picked up. Lady told me they were too busy to do it. What kind of services is that!? Ive called places where they say they're slammed and it might be a while, I can understand that. That at least gives me the option to order and wait or order from somewhere else. To me its rude, Ugh."}
{"text":"I believed the posted hours! Turns out the posted hours are wrong! When I mentioned this to the person whom greeted me, she stated that I should try and tell yelp their hours ! Because she's already tried!"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi and amazing service (:  The  chiefs are great and make the most bomb sushi I've ever had. They aren't cheap about the fish like every where else I go. So thanx for a great sushi spot!"}
{"text":"Sushi Bay is one of the best AYCE places in Vegas.  The chefs are great!  After only a few times in they already had half of our order memorized.  The sushi is always very fresh and the 911 roll is AMAZING!  Pricing is right on point with AYCE being around $20.  Don't take my word on it, check it out for yourself!"}
