{"text":"Have been there a few times, very nice place beautiful design and excellent service; but the price compare to amount of the food you get is a bit high. And example is that you can get a Koobideh meal in other restaurants from 8 to 13 dollars but here it's $22, to be fair it comes with a small side of Shirazi salad and some fresh bread, but I still think it could be lower priced."}
{"text":"Firstly the service was friendly but lacking. After we were seated we waited for a long time before the server came for our orders but never asked if we wanted something to drink, we had to tell him that we would like something and then later we had to ask for water. I found that odd when they had an extensive wine list.
The falafel was good and I loved the bread. I'm vegetarian so ordered the veg stew and dh ordered the beef tenderloin kabob. Mine was disappointing as it lacked spice and came with a plateful of plain rice and 4 pieces of grilled vegetables. Dh said his kabob was spicy and cooked perfectly, he thought the rice was boring and dry.
We passed on dessert but were offered complimentary Turkish coffee or tea. We both had coffee and it was good.
The restaurant is nicely decorated with the Persian theme and the guitarist created a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"So expensive for so little food.
Although quality and taste of their food is good and the lady who served us was polite, as a person who knows Iranian food and restaurants I don't think I'll go back there again."}
{"text":"We've been here once, and it was brilliant. Best Persian Kababs I had in town! We really enjoyed it and we plan to go more often. The ambient is friendly, the waitress was very helpful and courteous too. The prices were more in the range if 20s to 30s; but it was worth it easily! 
I strongly suggest this place for people who want to taste a good Persian cuisine."}
{"text":"Great shisha, gets too loud on weekends for my liking. Good food and good service.  Just wish I could keep arch all to myself. It's been two years coming here now. Love it"}
{"text":"The decor is very cool. The owners are friendly. Food was very good"}
{"text":"We have been to this restaurant many times. When they started having the Houka we weren't as impressed with the atmosphere as then on the weekends the restaurant was full of college aged kids smoking the houka and playing board games... but it looked they they were missing the magic of the restaurant which was the food!!!! The food was amazing!!!!! We loved to get the chicken & pomegranate stew and also the kubede kabob!!! I can't even start to explain how the spices in these dishes make them so amazing!!! A definite culinary jewel!"}
{"text":"Food is good, shisha is decent...but you leave with a migraine and you smell like shisha for the next 24 hours. They need better ventilation"}
{"text":"My friends go on a regular basis, so i decided to join them, it was a very nice experience,,the shisha was good, clean, and full of flavour and the food, the chicken kabobs were good, the portion was great for the price, I recommend this place for shisha and food, it's a very good experience!"}
{"text":"WAY TOO expensive for a mediocre quality and very little food! really not worth it! I'll never go there again. They really need to lower their prices or they'll go bankrupt soon."}
{"text":"Our first visit to this place exceeded my expectations.
It's a family run business, the ambiance is really nice, the staff are very polite and welcoming.
Food was very good too and as much as I tried, I couldn't find anything really wrong with their service."}
{"text":"Excellent Persian food in Inglewood!

Arch is a new (Jan 2013), family-run authentic Persian restaurant on 9th ave.  This is not another falafel joint on the corner.  Arch serves some of the expected Persian standards- shish, etc.- but has a diverse menu including lots of vegetarian options.  The food is exceptionally well prepared, healthy, and subtly spiced to perfection.  

My personal favourite was the rich and flavourful pomegranate stew with saffron rice- it's one of the best dishes I've had anywhere in Calgary in a long time.  Potentially ordinary appetizers like the eggplant with lavash and the falafel (6 perfect falafel each served on a tomato slice) rise way above the standard. 

Appetizers are around $10 and mains run $15-25.  The portions are just right and the prices are justified given the quality of the food.  They also have a short but excellent selection of wines by the glass or bottle as well as a full bar.  

The service is warm, friendly and attentive, and the room is a well appointed large space with decor direct from the Middle East.  

Finish with the saffron tea and leave happy.  This place represents Persian food done right and is a major addition to Calgary's food scene."}
{"text":"Do you remember that sketchy karaoke place in Inglewood that nobody ever wanted to go near? Yeah, that one. Good news! It's gone. And it's been replaced with this gem of a Persian lounge!

The interior decor is gorgeous! Tapestries on the walls, gold gilded accents, an aquarium in the fireplace (or the aquarium channel....). It's like you've stepped out of Calgary and back in time.

The menu doesn't have the biggest selection, but what is there is mighty tasty. Think starters like vine leaves, hummus and cucumber dip, entrees including stews and kabobs, and then a beer and wine list to wash it all down with.

We started with the chicken shish fattoush (definitely big enough for a few people to share), hummus, and then shared a kabob shahi, a combination of any two kabobs for $32. It came with a big plate of rice and grilled vegetables each. We also tried the pomegranate stew. Such a unique flavour! Only three ingredients - chicken, walnuts and pomegranate. That's it. You mash up the chicken and then pour it over rice. It's sweet and nutty at the same time. So different. But a plate cleaner! There wasn't any left by the time we were done with it.

There's also live music on most Friday and Saturday nights.

Date night... here I come."}
