{"text":"Nice food, good service, when it's busy, you may need to wait for a bit.  Food taste quite nice, I ordered chicken tikka and goat vandaloo, the meat in both dishes was surprisingly tender and well spiced.  Nothing too special but everything taste what is should be taste. If you are around this area and looking for food, this is a place you can walk in and have a decent meal."}
{"text":"Terrible wait. Although the place was empty, with just 1 other family of 5 occupying a table, we had to almost wait over 45 mins for food to be brought to the table after the order. Although the food (butter chicken, korma ) was good but each dish (with the little meat in it) is good enough for just 1 person. The livingsocial coupon I used did help...But definitely this is not a place to be recommended... until unless u have 45 mins to waste, or a coupon or maybe step in for buffet.."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Indian food I have ever consumed. Staff has been friendly and helpful all 5 or so visits I've had. Vegan and vegetarian options are abundant. Very high quality food and service. 5/5. The \"sweets\" section of the establishment is also very good but I usually go straight into the restaurant which was recently renovated. Highly recommend everything."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Indian restaurant I've been in. It is authentic and the staff is super friendly. I've been here multiple times and it never disappoints, food is excellent quality and very flavourful. The selection of sweets is impeccable and can never leave without purchasing some. I definitely recommend this to everyone looking for delicious and authentic Indian food."}
