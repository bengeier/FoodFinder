{"text":"I will never give this place my business again. I'm horrified. I ordered online. Never again.  Do Not Use The Online System With Your Credit Card!  I entered my credit card info, and the order went through.  Then we get a call just as we get there. I sent my daughter in to get the order, and she came out to say that something was wrong with the card.  I went in, and it turns out the last number was wrong.  How did I find this out? They had printed it out.   Yep.  The \"pay online with credit card\" option? They print out all the info you put in and hand-enter it onto their in-shop machine.  So there was my credit card number, my name, the billing zip, the security code, and the expiration date, sitting on the counter printed in nice bold type, while they took peoples' orders and processed payments.  I told them to cancel the order and shred it, then changed my mind. Not trusting that! Lesson learned! I took it myself to shred it.  They looked affronted that they'd started cooking the food.  Those people have absolutely no idea what it means to mishandle someone's private financial information. They should call it iDentityTheft, not iWok.  I give a lot of leeway with businesses processing online transactions. IThey can take a while, your order might be later, there might be mistakes when they prepare the order... but I have never, ever seen anyone print out all my credit card info and leave it on a counter.  I'm angrier writing this than I have ever been when I sit down to write a review of something, but I want others to learn from my mistake.  We've only used this place once or twice, because we could order online while we were on that side of town and it was convenient. It's not convenient to have to monitor my credit card for a few months now.  Livid."}
{"text":"Had iWok again today and thought it was time for a review.  First time I had their food was a few days after they opened and I was disappointed.  Since they're so close to my house, I planned to try again after they had been open awhile.  Ate again a few weeks later and it was better, but not quite at the top of local Chinese restaurants.  However, they have continued to get better and now I'd put them at the very top.  My last 4-5 meals from there have been uniformly excellent.  Favorite dishes are tofu vegetables, beef lo mein and general chicken.  They have good brown rice.  Prices are very reasonable and portions are large.  If you haven't been there recently, give it a try."}
{"text":"All the food that I have had here tastes great. They have a variety of options on their menu. I absolutely love the lunch special which is everyday, unlike some places that exclude the discounted price on the weekends. The $5.95 lunch special comes with white or friend rice and your choice of either an egg roll or a drink. I personally love their egg rolls, so I always opt for that option. The portion size is huge, I can usually save half of it for another meal. I like many of their dishes but my favorite so far is their General Tso's Chicken. It indicates on their menu that it is spicy... but I do not think it is spicy at all, but I may have a higher tolerance for spice than some.   Another pro is that they have a low carb menu option if you ask for it. My husband recently started a low carb diet, so this is nice that this option is available. The service here is quick and friendly. The person working at the front desk was kind enough to bring the food out to my car because my baby was asleep in her car seat.   The only reason why I gave this restaurant 4 stars is because I found a couple of bones in my General Tso's chicken. Not a huge deal, but just something that I wanted to point out. Overall, this is my go to takeout Chinese restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"Not far off I-57 great place to stop on a road trip and get some veggies.  Food was fast and tasty.  Portions are large - 3 lunch specials would've enough for 5 people!"}
{"text":"Reasonably priced, delicious Chinese food with a cozy dine-in area.  My favorite items were the sesame chicken lunch and crispy tofu appetizer (oh man, the sauce).  Super friendly, attentive and empathetic staff who asked me thoughtful questions about the food along with engaging in skilled get-to-know-you banter.  I Want."}
{"text":"My son (Rick S) has already written a review for I Wok. We differed in our opinions, however.  I was surprised that the restaurant was empty at 12:30 pm on a Thursday afternoon. I would have thought that a place like this would be a magnet for people working in Savoy. Perhaps the 100+ degree days are keeping people from wandering out to eat.  There is nothing fancy about the restaurant -- just some basic tables and chairs. We were politely greeted upon entering. After placing our order for lunch specials ($5.95 for an entree, fried or white rice, and a can of soda or an egg roll), we were delighted to receive a complimentary mini order of Crab Rangoon. It tasted much better than the traditional kind we had come to expect in area restaurants.  The presentation of our meals was excellent -- a half sphere of fried rice alongside the entree. My Kung Po Chicken was great. The thing I noticed most was that the fresh taste of the vegetables just jumped out at me. The celery and mushrooms smelled and tasted sooooo good. My daughter ordered Chicken Egg Foo Young and raved about it. It smelled great when she heated up the leftovers today. She was beaming at getting to finish the meal today and asked when we would return. Rick had the Pepper Steak with Onions and seemed to enjoy it.  I used a CiSaves.com $10 certificate for $5, which made the lunch really cheap for three people. I have one more left and will certainly use it in the future.  If you are in the Savoy area and are looking for a tasty, inexpensive place for Chinese food, I Wok is the place to go."}
{"text":"The Mongolian beef and fried rice were delicious! Good lunch spot, super fast service, and cheap."}
{"text":"The place is nice an clean and offers good size portions for the price. The quality is above average."}
{"text":"Their mapo tofu is our family favorite. Owners are very nice and they have good portion size with all the fresh ingredient and with good price."}
{"text":"I had great service, I asked for a custom order of sweet and sour chicken with certain veggies added.  They were very accommodating and the food was delicious! I usually go to China King off of Neil, but this is now my go to place for Chinese!"}
{"text":"The crab Rangoon here is amazing ! The only thing is they forgot the sweet and sour sauce with it before which is annoying . The fist two times I went here the food was amazing ! The last time the service was horrible . They gave me the wrong food and when I called to tell them they just told me to come back another day and they will give me my order for free . I wanted to come back that day and I was told that they were two busy . The women did not take my name and she told me that they have my number in their records and hung up on me . I gave them three stars because the other two times the service and food was great ."}
{"text":"Holy cow! I was not expecting this to be THIS good!  I've driven by the spot several times. It's far enough off the road and in a small strip mall that I assumed it was simply another ratty Chinese buffet. I could not of been more wrong!  After reading several favorable reviews on yelp, I decided to stop in for lunch. It was refreshing to get to order off a menu again. I was a little out of practice and the server did a wonderful job of helping me decide what to order.  The food was amazing and tasted very fresh. I ordered the orange chicken. I can't wait to come back and try something else. I will be doing that very soon.  Great discovery!"}
{"text":"Yummy, inexpensive, and fast. Great customer service- They brought us the wrong soda once and delivery man came back to switch it out for the right one.  Try the kung pao broccoli. Rangoons are also not a crime."}
{"text":"Quick good food. The staff is very friendly and in the 4 years we have lived in Savoy they are our go to for a good bite. I have never had anything bad from here."}
{"text":"This place has never ever disappointed, and I've ordered from here at least 10 times. Food is quite fresh and flavorful and they managed to make it very quickly. The home style tofu is excellent, as are the beef with broccoli and governer tso's chicken. I've also tried the crab Rangoon and it is also delicious. Overall it's my go to place for Chinese food in champaign!"}
{"text":"I've been once, and it was definitely \"as good as it gets!\" just as I've been told. Ordered orange chicken for the chil'ren and a chili shrimp dish with extra spice for myself. I ventured out and ordered something new and it was great!   The restaurant is very small on the inside, so I can't imagine what it is like when it's busy. When we went, we were the only ones that were placing an order to stay. The people working there were very friendly and most helpful!"}
{"text":"Very good food, very friendly, best Chinese so far"}
{"text":"They have a convenient location. I went around 5ish pm and we were the only customers but by 530 it got busy. Their prices are hella cheap. We ordered the beef broccoli, chicken curry, pork fried rice, egg rolls and vegetable lo mein. Tbh I didn't like the chicken curry. It tasted bland. The beef broccoli and the egg rolls were okay. THE FRIED RICE WAS THE BOMB. I even thought I could've just ordered the fried rice and I'd be satisfied lol. I'll be back if I'm in the area. But I'll only order the fried rice."}
{"text":"My family enjoys grabbing take out here. Large portions. Food is good. Pretty popular place. They offer delivery. Staff is always awesome. Been a customer here a few years now. We always try to order something different but my husband tends to get the chicken with curry quite often. The coconut shrimp is great, if you like something with a little sweet to it."}
{"text":"As a Chicago native I have grown accustomed to eating mediocre Italian, Mexican, Chinese etc. in central Illinois. But I wok rises above the average fray and then some. The building is new the lighting is great the woman at the desk could take an order with only minimal confusion.   The food was astoundingly delicious. Simplicity is key when it comes to Chinese food. Don't reinvent the wheel just provide me with that American Chinese taste I have had my whole life, and please make it fresh. The most notable thing about my girlfriends sweet and sour chicken was the almost non existent grease in the container. My sesame chicken was phenomenal as well. And hot damn were the portion sizes generous. I ordered the large and I am confident it will be able to feed me through 2 more meals.  18 dollars for 2 large portion chicken meals. Surely will be back again."}
{"text":"I Wok (or IWok... or iWok? There seems to exist no unified spelling) is a relatively recent addition to the sparse group of restaurants in Savoy. After getting a 50% off coupon in an online promotion, we decided to make a trip there.  Expectedly, the place is more geared towards take-out and delivery than a nice sit down experience, but there are several tables that don't feel too cramped if you do happen to want to sit down. The service is friendly. The menu is par for the course for similar restaurants in the area, you have exactly what you would expect and not much else - it even feels a bit limited compared to some other places. The prices, at least for the lunch special, is also about what other places charge - they come with an entree, rice, and a drink or egg roll. The food itself is how I Wok manages to stand out a little bit. Most dishes seem to be much fresher than other places - the vegetables actually tasted like vegetables rather than wilted sauce receptacles. The egg rolls and crab ragoon were both some of the best I've had at a fast food-style Chinese place, and left me wondering if I Wok is the rare place that will actually make them rather than use frozen ones. The pepper and onion steak and the kung pao chicken were both good, although the ratio of meat to vegetables for the steak was a little too low. Overall, if  you live in the area, it's not a bad choice to go if you are crazy some cheap and quick Chinese food. I probably won't be making the trek from Champaign just to visit I Wok, though."}
{"text":"Food was very cold took an hour&half for a delivery to Savoy which is where the place is located"}
{"text":"Good food. Fast delivery. We generally order the crab rangoon, pork egg rolls, pork fried rice and General Tso's Chicken with fried carrots and green peppers. iWok uses BeyondMenu.com as their online third party ordering service. We have had no problem with this service."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to eat! Family run and very hospitable. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Their food is absolutely delicious, especially their crab rangoon! I live in Savoy, so I'm a regular customer. My favorite dish of theirs is the sweet and sour chicken. I've tried other places in the CU area, including China King and and Ichiban buffet, and they were not as great as this place. Highly recommended!  By the way, their food is priced very well."}
{"text":"Great food and deals. Lunch specials during the week not weekends. They are always nice. Did I mention how good the food is? Awesomeeee!"}
{"text":"Some of the best food you'll eat in Champaign/Savoy area. Period. The food was so freshly prepared I couldn't believe it. This is authentic stuff. The Orange Chicken blew me away. I wasn't expecting this to be honest. The service is VERY frequently and the prices are almost absurdly low which is a major draw. Love, love, love."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with this restaurant. I was expecting to love it based on what my friends said, but I ordered off the vegetarian menu and beef ended up on my plate. I won't be eating here again."}
{"text":"First visit,  we sat down to look at menus, and they waited on us,  I didn't expect that, large menu so i didn't know how long we wanted to check all of it over.   Food was very hot, and all the veggies were soft, loved it that way.  Very clean dining area, friendly staff.  Good portion size along with price. Would eat here again."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in the C-U area.  I highly recommend the Dragon Phoenix.  The owners and staff are very nice and go the extra mile to make sure you have a great dining experience."}
{"text":"By far the healthiest Chinese in Champaign-Urbana/Savoy. They are very accommodating to food restrictions and different diets."}
{"text":"Very average food and reasonable prices. The coconut shrimp was kinda mehh... Wayy too sweet and no coconut flavor coming through, just sweetness. The hunan chicken and the mix fried rice were both quite average as well. Didn't have very high expectations from the place and as expected it was just Ok. Good if you want large portions at a good price but don't go looking for high quality."}
{"text":"I love this place and the people that own it.  The food is wonderful and they will cater to any dietary restriction and need in a tasty manner.   The crispy tofu is worth the trip.   The Kung pow chicken seems to be authentic as can be.  Prices are reasonable and service is fast."}
