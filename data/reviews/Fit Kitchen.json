{"text":"Fit Kitchen is filling a massive niche market here in Calgary as they offer high nutritional value, performance-oriented meals in fast and convenient packaging. With a multitude of meal choices for breakfast, lunch and dinner, as well as snacks there is likely something for everyone. It is as easy as grabbing what you want from the self-serve fridges and checking-out. I recommend the street-style tacos and the beef enchiladas.
I look forward to seeing this business model rapidly catch on and there be more Fit Kitchen locations all over the city."}
{"text":"I recently (re)joined the fitness world and I was struggling to keep up with being a new business owner along with eating well to support a healthier lifestyle. I decided to try Fit Kitchen for a week just to take the pressure off meal planning and grocery shopping. I ordered 10 meals ranging from breakfast to dinner and from green (lean) to red (performance) which arrived promptly in my delivery window. Everything looked good when it arrived - lots of colour and really fresh. The next day I had my first meal: The Get Gainz Gnocchi. I was blown away - the freshness, the taste, the spice and the amount was perfect. I have since worked my way though 50% of my order and I have been beyond impressed with everything. I would highly recommend Fit Kitchen to anyone looking to support a healthy lifestyle and I look forward to continuing to try out new recipes. I should also note that I am a trained chef and wildly pretentious food critic - so that should also speak volumes."}
{"text":"Fit Kitchen is exactly the kind of fresh food to go place that Calgary desperately needs. Delicious portions, fresh, fast and wonderfully convenient- Fit Kitchen has taken away the daily 8pm panic of \"I don't know what eat and I'm starving but also so tired from my day\" routine. Some claim it to be too pricey but I feel that it's money well spent instead of buying late night sushi (pricey) or pub food (bad for you). The quality of ingredients at Fit kitchen plus the knowledgeable and friendly staff make it a landmark spot in Calgary. Eat great- be fit!"}
{"text":"I went to FitKitchen on the weekend as I was looking for alternatives to fast healthy meals to bring with me to work.  I really enjoyed the experience (store staff was really helpful) and I've been really enjoying the meals.  It's pretty expensive and difficult to get to so I'm not sure how long I will be able to keep frequenting here - if delivery gets cheaper or the cost on the food comes down slightly then I'll likely be a customer for a long time :)

Pros
-Great store design
-Labeling/Nutritional information is easy to follow
-The food is really quite good

Cons
-It's pretty expensive
-Location is far south and delivery is quite expensive"}
{"text":"Fit Kitchen was somewhat lacking, in my opinion. My sister and I drove out here from way up north, but when we got there, there was hardly any food! We were told that food gets brought in every day at 2pm, and so they were running low, which is somewhat understandable. They did have some options still, so we purchased the no guilt Mac and cheese and the energy balls. The energy balls were good, but I feel there could have been more than four of them for what we paid. The Mac and cheese was also drastically lacking in flavour when we took it home to heat up and eat. Again, there wasn't very much for what we paid. The place is generally clean and i'd like to see what else they have to offer, but honestly, I probably won't be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"I like this store, super clean, nice employees great concept (healthy pre-made food for busy people) but it is so hit or miss for selection. Sunday morning I saw an Instagram post about coming in, stocking up for the week, 2 for 1 deals etc. I decided I'd go and do just that, stock up...but the selection was pretty poor to say the least. Almost no \"small\" sized meals. I drove ALL the way out here so I ended up buying more kids meals. I saw the 2 for 1 when I was paying as it was a small selection of pork or turkey. I'd def upgrade my rating for them if their selection was better."}
{"text":"Healthy delicious nutritious.  Great idea! Love it! Only worried because there's quite a bit of saturated fat. Will definitely be back though"}
{"text":"It's rare that I'm in Mckenzie Towne, but I just happened to be here once as I had an appointment all the way down south. I had some time to kill before my appointment and I was wondering the streets when I ran into Fit Kitchen. Fit Kitchen is another pre-made fresh meals concept that emphasizes on healthy, nutritional meals which gears towards both athletes and those just looking to lead a healthier lifestyle. It is especially marketed for those who have a super busy life and would like a healthy option instead of a fast food one. 

Right away when you walk in, there is this large sign that explains the colour-coordination of the packages. Green meaning \"leaner\" meals, which is typically lower calorie and its geared toward whose who are specifically looking to loose weight. Red means \"performance\" which is typically higher calorie which is looks like it's for those who just want to \"boost\" their performance in activity and just eat a more well-balanced meal. I also love that they have two different sizes! Small and large which is nice for those who want a little extra or those who want to portion control! They also include all the nutritional info on all the labels for those who are keeping track of their macros or calories. All of there meals cost between the $10-$15 range depending on what size you get, so again, it's your typical price when you go out and buy lunch on the go. 

When I looked around at the large fridge, I saw that they had a pretty decent selection still in stock. Their most popular meals were gone (I came at the end of the day) but when I asked how often to they re-stock, the staff said that they make fresh batches every day. I decided to pick out a breakfast and two lunch/dinners. They didn't have my first choices, as they were already gone, but I decided to pick out the next ones I thought I'd like. I picked out the champion's hash for breakfast, their guilt-free mac n cheese and power prawn curry bowl. I also picked up their pumpkin protein bars as a snack. 

Results? I LOVED the breakfast. The scrambled eggs didn't taste rubbery and I thought they had a healthy amount of veggies mixed in. I loved that they use Spolumbo sausages as well as it adds that little bit of local flavour. The guilt-free mac n cheese however was a no-go for me. I thought it tasted a bit bland and the sun-dried tomatoes was really overpowering. The power prawn curry bowl was alright! Again, I liked they had a good size portion of veggies in the curry as sometimes those bowls can be all rice.

Overall, it was enough for me to want to go back to try out a different selection, hopefully the ones I wanted to try in the first place! Huge con? Unless you live in the deep south, IT'S SO FAR AWAY!!!"}
