{"text":"this place is WAY too expensive and not great. if it was better than other casual vietnamese places the prices would be ok. but it's not particularly good, authentic or innovative. al & jo a block down the street has better banh mi for less."}
{"text":"Excellent real gelato! Try avocado if you can. I enjoyed the bahn mi here much more than La Viet. The bread here was crunchy outside, fluffy inside. Service: friendly. Nice!"}
{"text":"Come for the vegetarian banh mhi (replete with mushrooms, tofu, avocado, etc..), stay for nicely oily tom yum soup and made-on-the-spot gelato! Friendly staff and a good selection of snackables to take home."}
{"text":"Traditional banh mi? Absolutely not. Delicious banh mi? Absolutely. I bought two (didn't know how huge they were)- the tofu and the tuna, both spicy.  See? Exactly. Tuna salad banh mi. But throw some spicy mayo and traditional condiments on it and it's DELISH. I'm curious as heck about the hot dogs- how can they not be good?   If you're in the mood for a $7 sandwich in a delightful little space, get on it!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was absolutely incredible! They have the largest variety of food that I have ever seen. They have amazing and very authentic gelato, Vietnamese food, sandwiches, candy, bubble tea and more! Everything that I ate there was incredible. This place is going to be the next big thing (like Starbucks)!   After eating at OMAI, all I could think was: OMAI god how good is this food!"}
{"text":"Saw this cute \"prêt à manger\" place and decided to give it a try. I am a big fan of Bahn mi's and wanted to give their place a try. The decoration in this place is amazing ! Simple, modern and like the atmosphere. The Bahn mi was okay.. I feel like they didn't keep it to the traditional toppings and added more toppings to attract the westerners.  I will definately pass by another time to try the hot dogs. Definately better than having greasy burgers at the burger King beside them !"}
{"text":"Ooof... Sorry to say, but this place is not as advertised. I had a very sparsely dressed BBQ pork Bahn Mi on very stale bread and had huge sections of the brad that were rock hard and inedible... so that actually helped with the sandwich content to bread ratio.  This place is enormous and empty, which may explain why they didn't bother baking or ordering fresh baguette today. There are several counters that aren't even being used, including the highly lauded gelato bar. Not a single flavour available this afternoon.  They are pushing the limits of restaurant versus dépanneur with the vast amount of packaged snacks available and a totally out of place freezer full of Cool & Simple products like pizza and crème brûlée. I don't get it. What. Are. You. Maybe try doing one thing well? Just seems like a weirdo cash grab.   The guy who served me was friendly enough, if a little shy and lacking knowledge about the food. I asked him what he suggested and he said the chicken... because that's all he had tried.   The price was fine for downtown. The Bahn Mi was not ok. I can't usually finish a whole sandwich, but I ate this one and I'm still hungry."}
{"text":"The place is well lighted and spacious which is pleasant to dine in. The sandwiches and hot dog are tasty but just ok for a light lunch and a little expensive compared to the other Vietnamese sandwiches in Chinatown"}
