{"text":"Excellent authentique restaurant vietnamien
Le restaurant ne paye pas de mine, tout petit. 
La décoration est inexistante mais alors qu'est ce qu'on mange super bien
On en oublie tout le reste et le patron est un gentil monsieur qui aime discuter et conseiller les plats
Une superbe adresse !!!"}
{"text":"I had the beef pho, it was a large portion and it was very good. :)  It's a little place, modest, but the food is what matters most..to me ;)"}
{"text":"Came here because once again, I needed a break from moooo and baak baak that week and also was craving something new, original, AND had to have eggs in the formula. After a quick search in my bookmarks, I noticed I'd marked this place and they happened to have what I was looking for, called Bánh Xèo. Never had these before so time to discover. 

The place is small, seats about 14-16 if squeezed well, minimal decor, nothing inspiring and that's fine. Came here to eat something new and original so forget about the fine details. As for the food, it was ok but TBH, I was disappointed. In my mind, this was an omelette. Instead, you get paper thin very crispy crepe like something. You look at it and it breaks.

The old lady there explained how to eat it. You break the crispy crepe with your hand, stuff a lettuce leaf with this and the other ingredients that are inside (pork, shrimps, veggies) dip it in the sauce and stuff your face. Hmmm, although the taste was ok, the idea of using hands and then the effort into making something like a sad wrap which is pretty messy to eat, didn't sit well with me. 

I blame myself for not doing enough research on Bánh Xèo, not reading the reviews carefully and trusting my eyes, believing this is an omelette. I took the regular size because it's the same size as the \"extra\" but perhaps with two or three shrimps less inside.

Long story short, after spending $15 with tax and tips, I ended up at a McDonald's right after here because this thing wasn't filling enough. Ah well, it was an experience. Not going back, not for me but perhaps a good choice for you."}
{"text":"This is a very authentic Vietnamese restaurant. That being said, it wasn't for me and not worth going out of the way. If you need to sample some home cooking typical of Vietnam, give this place a try. The owners are very nice and taught me how to eat the 'pancake' wrap. The rolls were good, I don't think I would do the pancake wrap - too messy, and the pho-like soup was OK."}
{"text":"Les banh bot loc sont un de mes plats vietnamiens préfères et quand ma mère est trop occupé pour m'en faire, ceux-ci goûtent pareils. 

Essayer les en entrées de vos banh xeo.

L'aspect gluant créé par la farine de tapioca ne sera peut-être pas apprécié de tous. A l'intérieur vous avez du porc et crevette. A l'extérieur, il y a des oignons frits et échalotes."}
{"text":"Loved their banh cuon! Their menu is written in Vietnamese but it has pictures, looking forward to try more dishes!"}
{"text":"If you like banh xeo (vietnamese pancakes) this is the place to go to. Super small area though but expect super good banh xeo. They also have shrimp rolls that are transparent i dont remember the vietnamese name, but those are good as well. Worth trying if you are tired of pho"}
{"text":"Banh Xeo is very underrated Vietnamese meal! If you haven't tried it you absolutely have to! That is if you enjoy something that is a crispy omelette/ crepe texture (not actually eggs) with a bit of seafood, sprouts, lots of greens with some nuoc mam sauce! Don't be afraid you can eat it with your hands or with chopsticks. The flavour is light, crispy and a wonderful different option from the ordinary. The serving size is healthy large and delish. 

I asked them politely if they could make me up an avocado shake which was thick, creamy and served with a spoon. Really as I love it. 

The restaurant itself is very modest. Like a simple family run place. The crowd when i visited was mostly Vietnamese locals. 

I'm really impressed . It's that good! 

***only small downside is they take cash only. Totally understood as it's a small business and those greedy CC companies charge large amounts. It's a small inconvenience that I'm willing to forego for delicious Vietnamese crepes!"}
{"text":"No pho here but they specialise in everything else! They make fresh in store banh cuon and banh beo. We tried the banh beo and it was delicious! The banh xeo is probably the best I have ever had, even compared to toronto. Their bun mang vit is very flavourful and the duck was soft and fresh. We got a cafe sua da as well and it wasn't too bitter or too sweet. I ordered a che 3 mau but they sold out so I got their suong sau che with coconut milk and it was pretty yummy, although a bit watery."}
{"text":"Authentic vietnamese restaurant, pretty small and not fancy at all but if you're tired of Pho, this is the place to go for banh xeo \"vietnamese crepe\". They have the best banh xeo I've had so far."}
{"text":"so i was starving, walking down the street to find a place to have late lunch.

everything is in french, of course, and my french is limited.
i'm walking and low-and-behold, i see a vietnamese sign for 'banh xeo'.
BINGO.
helps that i can read vietnamese and i love vietnamese food.

this hole-in-the-wall place is really delicious. the owner is super nice.
and they carry all my favorite vietnamese dishes.

i had the 'banh cuon du thu' = flour rolls combination.
they make the flour rolls there fresh. and their fish sauce is really good, just like how my mom makes it.

sweet! i found a home, away from home- somehow in montreal.
i'm definitely coming back here a zillion more times during my stay here."}
