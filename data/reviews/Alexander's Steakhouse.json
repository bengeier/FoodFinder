{"text":"Alexander's was the place to go when you want to celebrate anything. Back when I used to visit Champaign, I'd get invited to go there for birthdays, graduations or simply if you want to grill minus the clean up.

As mentioned by Melissa, they do have a variety of steak cuts with chicken and pork. If you're a steak lover, you should be able to find numerous nice cuts if you're willing to pay up. Back in the poor college student days, those nice steaks were difficult to avoid. Anyhow, once the steak had been picked out, you simply place it on the big grill, in the middle of the restaurant and you let it dance and sing. You also have the option of letting the waiters / waitresses to cook it for you. The grill is also used for garlic butter texas toast as well as potato-grilling.

Besides the grill, there is a salad bar with a decent variety of salads, ranging from typical greens to creamy mac salads or creamy potato salads.

Given a decent list of decent restaurants on the campus of U of I, Alexander's is actually worth while.  I would recommend this place. Hell, go celebrate your birthday or better yet, your A's on your midterm with a nice big juicy rib eye (if you know how to grill) :)"}
{"text":"Dined here tonight for a retirement dinner. Service was slow, had to go ask for steak sauce repeatedly, potatoes appeared after I had finished grilling my steak, the salad bar wasn't refilled so I had to locate another station just to get a salad and the sticky bathroom floor was yucky. Just not a good experience. Way too much money for what I experienced."}
{"text":"we had reservations and were seated quickly. we ordered three appetizers, each came so far apart that we finished with one before the next arrived. I sat with an empty glass of tea for nearly 15 minutes at one point. the kalamari was rubbery, the onion rings were oily and the potato skins were tough.  we waited another hour for our food. 7:15 arrival, nearly 9 when we got our food. Ive been here 3 times this year after hearing for years how fabulous this place is. the verdict, overpriced for what you get, you would get a better meal at texas roadouse for less money. service, worse every visit. I dont plan on EVER returning there again"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. I thought the steaks are overpriced. I enjoyed cooking my own steak. You have to pay $2.00 for them to cook your steak."}
{"text":"WOW, so disappointing. Ordered a bone-in ribeye medium rare, both times (yes you read that correctly) both times the steak came out medium NOT medium rare. Manager came by the table and said they would remove my steak from the bill and she gave me a card for a free 6 ounce sirloin on my next visit, really! When we get the bill my friend is charged for his steak, that he had to send back twice because it was under cooked. We were also charged $10.99 for a salad bar. So although the salad bar is included with your entree because they removed my twice incorrectly cooked steak, they decided to charge me for the salad bar. Unbelievable, I only ate a half a plate of salad because I thought I was going to eat steak!!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went out to celebrate that I got a new job, and were told this place was really good. We were sadly very disappointed. The decor of the place is really outdated, you feel like you went back to the '80s. While the waitress was really friendly, we were not pleased with the overall experience. My $6 beer was flat, the food was really overpriced and you had to pay extra to have it cooked. Yes, if you want someone to cook your food, you have to pay an extra $3. For that extra 3 bucks they don't even have a chef cook, just some cook who has no idea what he's doing. I ordered my steak medium rare and got it well done. The steak itself was nothing special and for a fillet it was pretty fatty. I will never be coming back and will recommend friends to never go there."}
{"text":"Instead of Back to the Future, more like Forward to the Past. And a good trip it is.

Alexander's is a bit retro -- a well maintained woodsy interior reminiscent of a forest lodge, brass railings, salad bar, wrap around bar surrounded by people, glowing charcoal pit, caring wait staff, happily chatting customers, and a background sound system you can hear over. The intent is to have a cozy surrounding for folks to gather round the fire, cook their meat of choice, and have a nice dinner together. Kind of like a backyard cookout but with more food, no bugs, no wind.

They offer an early bird special menu before 6 PM with meals priced mostly in the teens, including salad bar, a choice of potatoes, and Texas toast. The beef is aged and of good quality. There are also chicken and seafood meals. The main dinner menu offers more choices and meals run in the $30s and up. 

I chose the Santa Maria Top Sirloin, a 10 oz steak hand rubbed with a proprietary spice mix. It took me a few minutes to remember how to cook on charcoal, but I got the hang of it and the result was a tasty steak cooked exactly the way I wanted it. While I cooked my steak I enjoyed the salad bar. It was fairly small in terms of length, but they packed a lot of goodies onto it, including real bacon crumbles and many other special toppings. Fries were thin in one direction and broad in another. They were clearly cut from whole potatoes and were fried perfectly for crunchy skins, crispy fries, and moist interiors.

The bar tender, Hali, was patient with me, explaining how the place works, attentive to my needs (bringing the french fries at the right moment, making sure my drink was in good condition, and that I had everything I was supposed to have), and pleasant.

Its sad there aren't many places like this anymore. Its great that there is Alexander's."}
{"text":"These people giving bad reviews are missing the point. This restaurant has been here for 30+ years. The whole concept behind it is cooking your own steak! It's fun to stand around the grill, have a drink and chat with friends while you cook, that's the whole point! If you don't want to do that then there are plenty of other steak restaurants in town to go to. These complaints would be akin to going to a hibachi style steakhouse where they cook at the table and then complain that they are cooking too close to your table! Alexander's is a good restaurant with high-quality food and a fun concept, if you don't want to cook yourself then it's probably not the place to go."}
{"text":"Ive always enjoyed coming here.  My mother lives in the area and this is one of our go to places if im visiting.  

The meats seem good, you get your salad bar , texas toast and a baked potato.  

Now, for the not so great part...   dum dum duummmmmm!!!!....

The thing is, i simply dont care for the \"cook it yourself\" thing.  If im going to a steakhouse, i want to sit at my table and enjoy some conversation with family/friends, Not stand over a giant fucking grill cooking my own meal.  If i wanted to grill a steak, i will go to the jewels or dominick and buy one.  Then i will light my grill, grill said steak and veggies to perfection, and enjoy it either in the comfort of my own home or patio.  I mean, seriously??   I have to cook it???

So yeah.  Its always been decent..  But if it wasnt, i would only have myself to complain to... I mean, i cooked the damn thing!

If you want to go to a steakhouse, pay steakhouse prices, then cook it yourself, sure, this is the place.  i guess."}
{"text":"Solid steakhouse. Great atmosphere, can cook your own steaks if you choose, which is half the fun. Friendly servers and easy access off the interstate. We found this place via YELP and were very pleased. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Omg, so much meat (yes, yes, that's what she said).

A group of us went to Alexander's on a Friday for dinner because they have this crazy student deal where you get steak, baked potato, texas toast, salad bar, etc. for $9.95.

The fridges stuffed with steaks, kabobs, and a tiny seafood tray also had a student steak section of smaller cuts which were still quite good.

I never knew a place like this existed where you get to cook your own steak on a big grill in the middle of the restaurant (or have them do it for you for an extra fee), and this way, you can make it as well done (or rare in my case) as you want.

It was way loud in there and I definitely didn't like how the smell of just... meat was oozing from my pores for the rest of the night, but I had a good time with my friends and left food-coma full."}
{"text":"First timer here. Heard about their steaks. Upon entering, the layout was kind of weird. I ordered a small steak and I chose to grill it myself on their huge do it yourself grill. Pretty fun. The steak was very good, but maybe that's because of my grilling. The salad bar is decent. The waitress was also very nice to us, and was a good waiter. I wouldn't say this restaurant is comparable to the Ribeye, but if you really like steak it is worth stopping by."}
{"text":"Second times for me in this place. Went back again on Tuesday evening. Me and my friend ordered 2 steaks and paid extra for chef to cook for us. 

When my food came to table.  Steak was under cook. I kidda wait for my sever come to me and ask me how the steak cook. Wait for 10 minutes.  She never show up. 

Finally I had to call another sever and ask him to put ed in back on grill. 

Okay chef bring steak back to me . And never see my sever again. And all the time happen  the manager stand 2 feet away from us. Never said any word. Ask me steak good or not. 

My t born steak have not any favor at all. And my friend steak all a lot of fat. 

Think about. If you a'll what to spend 30 usd for one steak. And pay extra for them to cook. 

Your food should be perfect and good service. But this is night mare for me  

I give 1 star cuz chef bring steak back to me. If not, I won't give any thing. 

And absolutely I won't come back to this place again."}
{"text":"Overall, this place is good. There are so many varieties of meat to choose from. I especially like the cook your own steak. The only parts I don't like is the decorations, which are old and how they change the charcoal at an time that I don't like, which is when I'm cooking my steak."}
{"text":"there were 4 in our party.  On entering, no eye contact from the seater, no hello, just \"how many?\"  She breezed us to our table,  didn't stop her stroll, threw 4 menus on the table with 3 seats and said \"Have a nice meal.\"  We didn't stay."}
{"text":"It was an ok experience. The food was good and having to cook it yourself was fun for a family. Was it the best food I have ever had? no. The building is quite old and it seemed very dark in there. The floor was sticky and the table also was sticky. I guess I am not in a huge hurry to go back."}
{"text":"So this is basically my husbands favorite place in Champaign. We have been there 3 times now and it's always good. 

You have the option to cook it yourself, which we normally do, or have a cook do it for you. All the meat is great! It's a mans restaurant for sure! Giant chunks of meat, abnormally large potatoes and Texas toast. There is a great salad bar too. 

I really love how clean it is here! Never once have I had a complaint. No hairs in my food, no dirty floors or silverware. They seem to have it together. 

I don't like how closed in it is around the grills. You can hardly move. Let alone drink your expensive wine... 

My server has always been nice and helpful. 

But don't go here and plan to eat quick. This place takes time. 

Anyways... its meat you want... that's what you'll get here!"}
{"text":"This is a really nice experience. You get to cook your own food. Though it might not sound appealing to a lot of people, but it really is a good experience. The place is amazing."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a meal here for my spouse's birthday.  Steaks were fantastic (are cut in-house apparently).  We had them cook the steaks and were not disappointed.  The server was a bit less attentive than I would have expected for the price.  She had a large party next to us and seemed to spend most of her time with them.  Our steaks were allowed to sit and cool at the grill (I SAW them and watched until they were collected) and my drink glass was allowed to sit empty for a bit twice.  Still, if steak is your thing and you don't need fancy atmosphere, then this is the place."}
{"text":"Came here to meet some coworker friends to eat some steak. Not bad at all. First time I've seen a place where you can pick your cut of steak and cook it on your own which is optional. Had the 9 ounce Filet Mignon with steak Broccoli and baked potato. I also had salad from the salad bar which was included with the meal. The service was great and the server was very attentive to the needs of everyone in our table. Not a bad piece of meat, cooked perfectly. Not the best filet mignon I've had in my life but had good flavor to go along with a nice glass of Malbec wine."}
{"text":"If you can get there before 6pm, take advantage of the EARLY BIRD SPECIALS:
6 oz.filet mignon for $21..


We picked out our own steaks,  and I got to cook them!!!
Tender and  juicy. EXCELLENT!!

A bottle of Stella Artois is a bit pricey at $5.25..
And so are the desserts..
service could have been more attentive.."}
{"text":"We did not cook our own steak as that wasn't really our thing -- although the groups partaking in that aspect seemed to be enjoying themselves. We had to pay a couple extra bucks to have them cook it for us and they got both steaks wrong.  We asked for medium and got rare/medium rare which wasn't the end of the world not would that cause me to give a bad review. The disappointing aspect was that the steaks were so bland.  They seemed like good cuts of beef but they were the most flavorless steaks I've had honestly. The baked potato was actually really good yet the salad bar was nothing special. The place seemed okay but was dirty and the lighting was terrible IMHO.  Our waitress was nice and friendly and the service was good from that aspect.  

Hard to get over such a bland steak (both the filet which my wife ordered AND the top sirloin I ordered) and dirty restaurant.  Probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Excellent steaks. Good service. Overall great experience for cook your own food. The only thing I would like is some steaks that are smaller sized just for convenience sake. Otherwise definitely worth going to if you're out in Champaign."}
{"text":"Didn't get to eat here. Time is wrong on Yelp. No closed sign on the door. I called to confirm if they were open and then politely told them they should probably update the time. Employee told me \"Yelp controls that it's not our fault.\" And then blamed me. Poor attitude. Fix your page."}
{"text":"Three out of five steaks were either wildly overcooked or undercooked. You pay extra to have a chef cook your steak - anyone could have probably done a better job. Our server was very nice, but this is way overpriced. A steak house that cannot cook steak. We sent back the two steaks. One came back still undercooked and one came back completely unseasoned. Our waitress was very apologetic and comped the dishes that weren't cooked properly, but still..."}
{"text":"Get a long island ice tea.  They are amazing.  Enjoy a great beverage while you cook your own steak just how you like it!"}
{"text":"Not a bad idea. At Alexander's Steakhouse, you pick your own steak and cook it at the community grill. 

For starters, the steak's quality here is just okay. It's not the greatest, but I've had worse. And for okay steak, I feel they are overpriced in general and not just for college students. 

Their steak challenge is pretty interesting though. If you can finish a 3 lb (48 oz) along with the side dishes and salad that comes with this challenge, you win a free meal. The rewards of this challenge has changed from time to time (i.e. the steak is free, you get a free steak next time, or you get 50% off next time, etc). I've tried this before. It was pretty fun and I got my picture taken and placed on their wall. 

Overall, Alexander's is a good break from the national chain steak restaurants. You'll pay a little more than you want for some decent steak. Oh and as a warning, if you can't grill a steak, then you'll have to pay an additional fee to have the chef cook it."}
{"text":"Alexander's Steakhouse is by far the most interesting eating you can get by the mall area. In the middle of the restaurant is a large charcoal grill surrounded by seasonings and buckets of what claims to be butter. Basically your pick out a steak and cook it yourself alongside potatoes and good old texas toast, dousing on the butter as you go. No, this is not health food. They have a variety of different steak cuts, as well as some chicken and pork selections. It's a rowdy crowd and expect lots of drinking around the grill and I had my doubts about sanitation with all the drunken butter use. If you want a backyard grill experiences in the dead of winter, this place is great, but it's very pricey, loud, and I found out the hard way about charges for sharing ($7!)."}
{"text":"Love this place. Salad bar is of high quality, and you can cook the steak by yourself! Juicy RUBEYE!!!"}
{"text":"I think it goes without saying that you can't expect the best steak in Champaign, IL. That being said, their steak is well above average and fairly priced. The whole \"cook your own steak\" idea is an interesting concept, but if that's what I wanted to do I would buy my own steak (for much less) and cook it myself at home. Pay the extra $3 for a chef to make it for you so you can relax and enjoy your meal. The service is always very friendly and they make themselves available. By far my favorite steakhouse in the Champaign-Urbana area and recommend it to all."}
{"text":"My $45 porter house was over cooked. Asked for a med rare and got medium almost well. You would think for someone who cooks steaks all day they would know how to cook one."}
{"text":"Alexander's is a good place to go if you're looking for more of an experience than just eating dinner. They have 2 large grills where you cook your own steak after selecting it from the fridge. You can also grill up as much garlic butter toast as you want while standing at the grill. Not a good place to go if you just want to sit and be served. The salad bar is good but not great."}
{"text":"Little dated, little dirty and fun. Great place for a guys night out.  I would call it a man cave.  My wife would NOT like it!  But I did."}
{"text":"The point of going to Alexanders is to cook your own food. If you just want a steak then go somewhere else. 

That said, the experience that they create at this restaurant is wonderful. Albeit the salad bar is nothing special and the menu is somewhat limited, the atmosphere is lackluster, but if you like grilling in your back yard with the guys then you will love Alexanders. Also, Don't feel too bad about filling up on all of the Texas toast (it is kinda the point...and half the fun!)"}
{"text":"If you want to cook a steak yourself but you're too lazy to shop and put in the legwork, this is the spot for you! They charge you extra for their chef to cook it. Very much a steak and potato place. We had a mixture of filets, ribeyes and sirloins. The cuts were really good, not outstanding. Beets, bacon and eggs at the salad bar was a huge plus. Skillet cookie was top notch. The manhattan was terrible. Quality establishment."}
{"text":"Food was good. We elected to cook our own and the only downfall of that was that I didn't have all my stuff to cook them up right. I should have asked the barkeep for some bourbon but lesson learned. 

The steak was really tasty regardless the spices or lack there of. 

The beer I had was really tasty as well, had Hale to the Chief IPA and the Eugene Porter, both were good. The porter went really well with the skillet cookie we got for desert. 

Little more pricey then I thought at first. But would come back."}
{"text":"Student and Early Bird (before 6pm) specials on weekdays (not including Friday) - steak (or pork or fish) and all you can eat salad bar for ~12$. Awesome!

This is the place to go for your steak fix on a student budget."}
{"text":"Tasty beef you cook yourself at a large open vented indoor grill. Chef will grill your steak for your for an additional charge of $2.79. Salad bar respectably populated with the usual fare, e.g., red beets, shredded cheese, broccoli, cottage cheese, etc.  Former site of the Round Barn Restaurant.  Overall good dependable and tasty. Not fancy. Wear comfortable shoes if you plan to cook."}
{"text":"I would have given this place a 5 but took off for the ceiling dripping water in the womens restroom.  My mom and grandmother both about fell while in there.  The manager was in there sitting at the bar and was told of the problem and he never even got up to do a thing.  Eventually a cone was put up in there i think by a waitress who said this happens a lot.  This place needs some money put into it but the owners refuse i guess.  Its not like they dont make money with what they charge.  The steaks we grilled ourselves which i enjoy and i usually eat too much texas toast while standing at the grill.  Everything about the meal was delicious from the tender steaks, to the wonderful sauted mushrooms, to the warm dessert cookie with ice cream.  The bartender makes strong drinks and my waitress was wonderful and checked on us often!  I believe the waitresses name was jess and the bartenders name was jen, who has been there for years.  Only other downfall i feel is the salad bar is set up strange with having to go on both sides to get what u need so when its busy u have to stand in line for each side.  Also its in a weird location.  Other than the two negatives i had a great experience!"}
{"text":"I like the people who come here and complain about having to cook your own steak. That's the reason you come to Alexander's. Grab a big hunk of raw meat, throw it on some coals and eat the fresh salad bar while your steak is cooking. 

After munching on the lettuce filler, grab your cold beverage and hover the long grill staring at awe until your steak is cooked to your liking. Throw on some sautéed mushrooms and enjoy. 

After you've eaten enough meat for a week in a single sitting, then top it off with a skillet cookie and ice cream. 

Can't get any better than that. 

I've always enjoyed the food I've cooked at Alexander's, Jennifer at the bar is fantastic and the salad bar is fresh. Check it out!"}
{"text":"I try to eat here at least once while visiting family in the area.  The food is plentiful and while the price is higher than I'd prefer, the food is of good quality.  You do have the option to  \"cook your own steak\" if you feel up to the task, but I've eaten here a dozen or more times, and never cooked my own steak once."}
{"text":"Blah! Not impressed. I had their Santa Maria Sirloin, cooked it myself, not great cut of meat, ok salad bar, not great beer options. Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I am SPEECHLESS. this would be CHRISTMAS for the health department. I went here on dads weekend and watched as everyone used seasoning and garlic brushes on the raw meat and then proceeded to use the same brush for the garlic bread!!! cross contamination is an UNDERSTATEMENT. i had one bite of the bread and ended up with food poisoning all night. I am in UTTER DISGUST that this place is still standing."}
{"text":"Delicious food and even better employees!! It's like a family when you walk in. My steak was cooked to perfection and the salad bar is amazing!! I would definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"Alexander's was definately the place to go for celebrating anything good during my time at UIUC.  It's the perfect atmosphere for a small group of friends to hang out for conversation and fun around the grill pit, munching on texas toast.   

As you prepare the meats yourself, there's really little to complain about the cooking, and I've always been satisfied with the meat cuts, and it's definately affordable on an every-now-and-again basis for a college student."}
{"text":"Too pricey when you have to cook your own meat - that was ok, but not great.   Selection a bit limited and noisy when busy.   Of course, I did not have the student price - so may be 3 stars if you can get it for $10."}
{"text":"Recommended by our hotel. Bottom line you get a 50.00 steak that you cook yourself on a grill in the center of the restaurant, If they cook it for you it's 2 bucks more?! The service was very friendly but very very slow. With the steak you get a baked potato that arrived with no butter or sour cream. By the time the butter and sour cream arrived I was 1/2 into my steak. Oh yeah you also get a lame salad bar.  Go to longhorn or outback. Or if you want to spend that much go to Ruth's Chris"}
{"text":"Eating at the bar, the staff is friendly. Yum free popcorn. The salad bar is so so needs to be cleaned now and then. The ribeye I had needed some seasoning cooked to order med but somewhat bland.
We were hoping for better, don't think I will be back"}
{"text":"For a cook your own steak placeit's good. More of a \"guys cook their steaks and drink beer\" place but if this is what your pleasure is. It's great. Good quality meat."}
{"text":"Not worth the money, we paid the $2 to have our steaks cooked and they were not cooked the way we requested them. Additionally, the topping options got the baked potato was lacking. Don't plan on visiting again."}
{"text":"Great concept - pick your own, cook your own steak.  Unlimited salad bar, baked potatoes, bread.  Steaks are huge......

Sure, the decor is circa 1984, and could use a little updating, but the food is good, and it's a fun place."}
{"text":"Just driving through the area and had to stop for the night. I checked into a nearby motel and then decided to grab a bite here at Alexander's. The decor made me think it would be much more affordable than it was. I mean, vinyl tablecloths at a steakhouse? I figured I'd be able to get a burger, but nope, not on the menu. They did have a variety of steaks, along with a couple chicken entrees and seafood entrees. Now, I don't go to many steakhouses, but the $2 upcharge to have them cook my steak for me was surprising. No steak for me. I ordered the shrimp, which came in a huge portion. In fact, they were too big (which sounds ridiculous, but trust me.) I ate 1/2 of the serving and left the rest. They were gummy and flavorless. The garlic toast was greasy and burnt, and if therecwas garlic involved, I missed it. The salad bar was unremarkable, but not bad. My waitress was sweet and attentive, and I was just too tired to complain about the food and wait for them to fix it. On the whole, even if I lived in the area, I doubt I'd go back."}
{"text":"I had an overall enjoyable time at Alexander's, but I think that's mainly because I came with a large group who mostly enjoy cooking meat. They do have a pretty nice selection of cuts, so choose carefully. 

I picked out a teriyaki filet mignon and smoked it for a while before searing both sides and it was one of the best steaks I'd ever had. Unfortunately the individuals that ordered steaks to be cooked for them did not get it prepared the way they were hoping for. I also really don't think the prices are justified considering you are cooking your own meat. 

Overall, you will enjoy this if you have an outing with a group that wants to do a cookout with no preparation or cleanup for extra cash."}
{"text":"Ok steaks,...dirty restaurant (very unsanitary).  Steaks were bland so pour on the seasoning before cooking your steak.  The one thing that really grossed me out is that the seasoning shakers were SO disgusting - something you would want to have gloves on before picking them up."}
{"text":"This place is always amazing. I do not care what other people think. I go here for the main reason that they have fresh meat, and yes I do cook it myself usually. If not then I have Eddie prepare it for me. This is a hangout spot, made to have a good time. So sitting around the grill, cooking some steak and garlic bread, while having a drink and chit chatting with friends or other people around the grill is exactly what I want. I love their service staff; always quick to help wit an order or to replenish your drink. 

If you're one of those people that want great food, a great atmosphere, and great service, then this would be a good place to go every once in a while...as I usually spend anywhere from $70 to $100 here every time I go. But well worth it!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My family goes here for special occasions.  I love the food.  You get to pick out your own steak which is pretty cool.  However, you have to pay extra for the restaurant to cook your food- ya (which is why I knock them down to 4).  With your meal, you get texas toast, a baked potato, and a salad bar.  So you will have plenty of food.  Never had a problem with parking.  Service has always been pretty good.  Good for groups.  They have some kind of eating contest: I think if you eat their big steak you get it for free and your pic goes up on the wall."}
{"text":"...and on the seventh day God rested and thought to himself,  \"I am hungry for a steak.\" So he made an old school steak house and he thought to himself,  \"all is well with the world\".  Don't listen to the haters.  This place has a patina to it.  Enjoy it in this world of chain restaurants.

Order a steak, cook it yourself and ask Eddie for advice on how to spice it.  Eddie has been there longer than some customers are old.

If you like an old school steakhouse, this is a must.  This is on my top 10 for casual dining."}
{"text":"I had not been here for several years.  I won't be going back anytime soon.  Way too expensive for what you get.  My meal was $27 for a fillet they cook.  The meat was fine the salad bar was empty there had been 3 buses.  The place was filthy.  The staff was beyond keeping up.  $8 for half a glass of wine.  My bread was burnt my broccoli was cold and like eating a bush.  It took an hour to get our meal.  The waitress was absent.  The popcorn was burnt...YIKES!!!"}
{"text":"It is the best place to start a great night, GREAT steaks best in town , if u want a steak and all the fixin's and a cold beer to wash it down , then here u go , you can cook your own on a huge grill with a drink in your hand it's like grilling outside minus the snow , so it's all good I promise"}
{"text":"Perhaps my experience left me feeling bitter simply because I was not aware that you are supposed to cook your own steaks.... Wait, restaurant... cook my own food????

Me and my dad went here because we were hungry for a steakhouse steak, but imagine our surprise when we walked in and our waitress explains how the restaurant works.  Oh, you can have the house chef cook the steak for you, but its $3 or something extra.... Pretty ridiculous if you ask me...  Well, we didn't come to cook, so we bit the bullet and got the chef to cook our food.  

But putting aside the whole \"cook your own steak\" deal, the restaurant was still very poor to me.  The prices are absolutely ridiculous.  Every entree was above $20 and we didn't exactly get a ton of food.  My platter was a medium sized steak, a small baked potato, and a very small serving of veggie mix.  The salad bar was very poor.  Very limited selection, and the food looked old and wilted.  

Our waitress was rarely around the whole night, and we even were placed on a side of the restaurant with barely any people.  This was especially troublesome based on how we were never given silverware, needed drink refills, and more napkin quite a few times.  Still, our waitress was never around.  

To be honest, most of the people in the restaurant weren't even eating...  It was mostly bar goers and people sitting around for drinks.   Not a good sign for the quality of food to say the least. 

All and all, I won't be going back here.  Food wasn't bad, but it was very under-portioned and ridiculously over priced.  The service was bad at least on the night I went, the salad bar was very sub-par, and most of the people in the restaurant were just there for drinks.   I can't get into the \"cook my own steak\" deal either.  Hell, I just would have stayed home and made my own steak for a 1/4 of the price."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner.  The place is outdated and dirty.  The waiter was not attentive and we had to ask several times for items from another waitress.  We even had to ask for our check!   The food was awful.   The steaks had no flavor and were chewy.  We had ours cooked.   Called to complain about the service because it was our anniversary and the manager could have cared less.  I would not recommend.  I can make a better steak at home for half the price.   Waste of time."}
{"text":"I dont want to go out to eat and be forced to pay more for them to cook my food. Dumb idea. Maybe if no upcharge kind of cool but come on. Three times i have eaten here never been dying to go back. Decent decor and texas toast is good. Take a grillmaster with you."}
{"text":"Steak, baked potato and salad bar were good. 

The grill your own steak option is unique but I'd stay home and grill my steak if I wanted to cook for myself. 

Enjoyed the experience. 

Get a skillet cookie when you're done!"}
{"text":"Good food took a long time to get it but it was a full bus of men all had stake and most cooked there own . I didn't want to over cook mine so I paid the 2 bucks to have the pros do it . Aged beef great sales bar . A little $$$ but it was frantic cut of meet .."}
{"text":"This has got to be one of The most overrated eateries in the area. Cheap meat, crap salad bar, just awful.  Go to a buffet and you will get better.  Very sad."}
{"text":"Visiting town and found this on Yelp. Pick your own steak and cook yourself .. How cool.. I am lazy I let them do it for me. The salad was plentiful. The staff very friendly . My steak New York was delicious .This is my first time at a self service steak house . How cool. 
The prices were on the high side 30-40 dollars for the streaks but well worth it .Stop here if you are in the area. Well worth it."}
{"text":"We recently tried Alexander's for the first time as a special occasion treat but can't stop going back! The calamari is the best we have ever had and is ultimately what keeps us coming back. We typically sit at the bar and have only had positive experiences with her- she is an excellent bartender and server. Furthermore, the meat selection is second to none. The long islands are great, the steaks are great, the salad bar is great. This is our favorite place to eat in Champaign!"}
{"text":"As other's have mentioned this is a \"cook your own steak\" place with a large grill for guests to cook their meat, texas toast, and baked potatoes at. 

The inside is very dated, I feel like for as much money they must make off their extremely high steak prices, surely they could invest some back into the restaurant.. but it still looks the same as it did the first time I went probably 10 years ago. 

I for one don't make a habit of coming here, but it's a popular place for birthday parties and special events so I sometimes have no choice. It is unique but if I wanted to grill my own steak I would go start my own grill in my backyard and save about 20 bucks. 

The meat selection is good, and the cuts are definetly the weight you pay for if not more. The worst part of this place is simply the insane price for a steak you cook yourself.. the salad bar not being all that great (the lettuce was very low and picked over quite a bit when I was there), and the fact you are sweating when you get back to the table from standing by a hot grill for the past 15 min cooking your steak. 

It is a cool place don't get me wrong.. and the food is good.. just can't justify the cost."}
