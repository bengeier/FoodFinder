{"text":"Authentic Puerto Rican food it reminds me of being back home! If you go I would advise you to eat the plate of the day with tostones and lots of mayo-ketchup:)"}
{"text":"I was at Madison Night Market last night pigging out at various food trucks. I came across El Wiscorican and a Costa Rican food truck with very similar offerings next to it. I had a hard time choosing between them, so I flipped a coin. I gotta say, I am so glad it landed on tails.  El Wiscorican was serving a combo plate of the day and a sandwich call La Tripleta. I got both:  The plate of the day was pork with Puerto Rican-style rice and a choice of a side (I picked savory fried bananas AKA tostones). For $9, I got a big clamshell filled generously with rice, pork, and tostones. The rice was deliciously savory and salty and also had some green olives and what appeared to be lentils. The pork was meaty and chunky with the perfect amount of fat. The spicy, creamy sauce on top gave the dish the moisture it needed. My only complaints were that the pork was barely too salty and that the tostones were too thin, dry, and sweet. I'm not going to lie, I was really looking forward to good tostones, so I was pretty disappointed.  La Tripleta is absolute perfection. Let's start with the foundation of any good sandwich, the bread. They claim to bake the bread fresh every day, and I believe it! It was perfectly soft and sweet. It was like Hawaiian bread and amaroso rolls had a baby on steroids. The meat mixture of beef, pork, and chicken with mayo ketchup had a great meaty and saucy texture. The crunchy potato sticks provide a nice textural contrast. If you're a fan of philly cheese steaks, you can't afford to pass up La Tripleta.  It's a shame that El Wisorican is mostly a lunch truck that I won't have access to. I'll have to keep my eyes peeled for when it's out for dinner time."}
{"text":"The tripleta, an overflowing sandwich with three kinds of meats, had just the right amount of crunch. Luiz was friendly and gave a brief but detailed overview of the menu. I highly recommend this cart, which has been situated on Dayton just south of the Computer Sciences building on the UW campus."}
