{"text":"Great food
The veal was so tender and tasty.
Great home cooked Italian food for a great price."}
{"text":"I only had a veal sandwich, so a pretty limited experience for the review.

The veal was very tender, and I loved the sauce and cooked peppers/onions. It wasn't necessarily the freshest, but I did arrive around 2pm, and it's par for the course at any hot table to expect that.

Worth trying it again."}
{"text":"Came here because I was waiting to get my tires changed next door at Active Green and Ross. 

It was quite pricey, lasanga with potatoes, another kind of pasta, and cooked veggies. ($13.95 including a drink) The lasnaga was good, and the potatoes, but carb overload! The veggies were meh. 

They also have breakfast and sandwiches made to order."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and the food is always very consistent. Their breakfast is fantastic, and you get what you pay for. The portions are more than enough for one person and you will still have left overs. Home cooked and tastes just like Nonna makes. You can always tell when a restaurant uses fresh ingredients!"}
{"text":"Like coming home !  Rocco knows most of his customers by name; and all are greeted as if they are invited to his own home   His Penne Ala Vodka is the best you will find in the western hemisphere!  A little hidden gem in much humbled surroundings as delicious as it is unpretentious"}
{"text":"This is truly a hidden gem in Mississauga. They have some of the best pastas and sandwiches. I ended up getting the Meatball sandwich and the Ravioli Pasta and it was perfect. Their homemade hot sauce is probably one of the best hot sauce in the city."}
{"text":"Went here over the summer and ordered the Penne Alla Vodka and meatballs and it was great! It my first time having Penne Alla Vodka and I was surprised by how great it was! I would seriously go back there just to having this! I've been for this dish at other restaurants since I've had it here and I haven't been able to find it yet but I'm sure that once I find a place hopefully in a better location that serves great Penne Alla Vodka I'll review it! This place is also family run and the employees are all super nice and helpful! I'll be returning for some Penne Alla Vodka soon!"}
{"text":"Wow what can I say. I was introduced to this place by a friends of mine. Now I stop in every time i'm in the area for lunch. If you want real quality home cooked food this is the place to go. The selection is great and you can tell all the food was made with love. The owner and son are always friendly and show that they take pride in this place. I recommend finishing your lunch off with an espresso. 

 In regard to the reviewer saying this is place is over priced. Please tell me where you can get a home cooked meal for under $15.00 made with quality ingredients. 

 Definitely check this place out because I promised you that you wont regret it. Looking forward to going next time."}
