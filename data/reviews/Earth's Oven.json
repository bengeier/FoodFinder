{"text":"I was lucky enough to discover Earth's Oven at a local farmer's market. Their bread is delicious and actually tastes like 'real' bread, something I've been missing since going gluten free. Their muffins are incredibly delicious and made with very wholesome ingredients. I have tried every gluten free product out there, and these guys have nailed it!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been gluten free for about 6 months and thought I would try this bakery.  I have found it hard to find quality gluten free baked products.  I wouldn't waste your time.  The bread is like a brick and the muffins are very gross.  I even mentioned to the lady that the bread felt really hard.  She told me to toast it. This did not help. Other then the pre-made frozen pizza's (that you can buy in many other locations). The food quality is poor.
I have had gluten free products elsewhere that tasted much better!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a gluten-free bakery in Calgary to send some goodies to my dad for his birthday. This was the first one that got back to me so I placed my order with them.

There was quite a language barrier to communicate all of my information over the phone and place my order. The whole phone call took about 20 minutes when it should have taken 5. After repeating myself many times we finally got things wrapped up and the employee said she would email me right away to confirm the details of my order and give me a price. This didn't happen until the next day after my dad had received the order. 

For a handful of cookies, muffins, and squares, the whole gift basket came to $60 including delivery. This is more expensive than your average bakery but seems to be on par for a GF bakery. My dad was quite happy with the baked goods and he said everything was delicious."}
