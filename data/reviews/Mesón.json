{"text":"Ambiance qui me donne la nostalgie de Barcelone ... Service chaleureux et Humain. La quantité des tapas et plus que raisonnable ... Certainement mes favoris pour un 5 a 7"}
{"text":"Pricy but the food worth it. 
Service is friendly.
It is the same chef than Tapeo. So you cannot be really wrong when you go there.

Had the bavette de boeuf. I really enjoyed it. 

Why not 5 stars? 
A little bit noisy and my beer was flat. 
Chairs are not the best."}
{"text":"Was here with a small group on a busy Thursday evening.  Unfortunately the service was very slow.  Waited about an hour before receiving our appetizers and another hour before getting our main dishes.

I ate the Bacalao al horno which was a bit pricey but very good.  Most of my group gave the food a 6/10"}
{"text":"Had the squid ink fish and chips-- absolutely divine! We also had the most charming and hilarious waiter ever-- he really took it up a notch! Plus, this place is absolutely stunning! Worth the trip-- I will definitely head back to try more of the awesome on the menu!"}
{"text":"Succulent, type brasserie avec un vrai service à l'Européenne! Cuisine savoureuse et variée, comme là-bas. Ne pas se contenter de prendre des plats québécois revisités mais vraiment des plats espagnols. Quant à la carte des vins, elle est pas mal du tout ! Le décor et lieu est vraiment bien, chic sans être trop formel ! À recommander !"}
{"text":"Service rapide et sympathique. Beau resto neuf et moderne. Un peu dispendieux, mais mon plat sortait de l'ordinaire. C'était bon! 2 ufs, croquettes de pommes de terre et serrano. 15$. Allez l'essayer."}
{"text":"I should start here. I love Tapeo. I have for years. I find that their passion for the place and the food is infectious. But now I have to add an extra night to my trip to Montreal. The reason is Meson. The restaurant is great. I love the room, I love the food, and I love the service. Sebastien and team have done it again.   I think it's because they just work so hard. And really love what they do. The menu is very fresh. I love the fact the restaurant is in a real neighborhood. If I lived in Montreal I'd be there a lot. Now I just have to settle for being there when I am in town"}
{"text":"Brand new restaurant - little brother of well knowned tapeo. On the same street but With a more modern and hipsy look !
Service : 100% passionnate and so sweet !

Sitting next to the Windows or at the bar: two excellent choice !"}
{"text":"Délicieuse paella quoique la version tapas est très bonne mais loin d'être aussi abordable qu'en Espagne. Les tapas a Montré sont devenu un plat de luxe et c'est dommage !
Très belle qualité pour un plat remarquablement exécuté. Belle cave à vin.
Je mets 4 étoiles pour la qualité de la cuisine et du service mais je trouve le tout un peu hors de prix pour une cuisine familiale bien que très bien exécuté.
À refaire et à conseiller : certainement !"}
{"text":"Ca change un peu du Tapeo. Les calmars sont délicieux et le mac n' cheese chorizo et 2 fromages espagnols sont à se rouler par terre.

Bon service, j'aime beaucoup"}
{"text":"Excellent endroit, excellente ambiance, musique et service au top! Sans parler de la bouffe qui était délicieuse aussi! Les choix sont originaux, ça change des autres places, et tout est vraiment super bon!
A essayer plus d'une fois! :)"}
{"text":"I've been for brunch and dinner... Brunch was great. Most dishes had a Spanish flair and were delicious. My experience with dinner was a little less satisfying. The dishes were fairly basic though I heard that they updated their menu and it is now more innovative. A great option if your in the villeray area."}
{"text":"A great little restaurant on Villeray street. Same owners as the famous Tapeo restaurant and a couple of blocks down from it. Therefore you can expect top-notch service, ambiance, wine list and food. The cocas (flatbread pizzas) are an excellent starter and you can choose from several options. The grilled octopus is infused with piri-piri and has a little kick to it.

My favorite main meals are the fish dishes and the steak and fries (can you tell I go there often). The fries are topped with sautéd beef bone marrow and when I put them in my mouth, Angels sing!

They also have a brunch option on weekends. Try the chili with blood sausage. Another celestial experience!"}
{"text":"J'y suis allé pour le brunch à la fête des mères. Tout était assez bien fait, mais rien d'extraordinaire. Le resto a une bonne presse suite à l'ouverture et c'était plein. Je note en fonction de mes attentes, qui étaient très élevées, sinon je donnerais probablement un 5. 
Mes principales critiques: 
1. \"L'identité espagnole\" me semble plus au moins claire dans le menu, pas assumée jusqu'au bout. Mais bon, c'était pour le brunch, il faudrait y retourner le soir.
2. J'aime bien qu'on attende que tous les convives aient terminé avant de desservir, un petit détail qui a de l'importance. J'aurais terminé les hashbrown laissées au milieu de la table après avoir été certain que personne ne les voulait.
3. Déco: c'est beau, neuf, belles grandes fenêtres, mais j'aurais aimé davantage d'audace."}
{"text":"Belle petite place dans Villeray! La nourriture est très bonne, le service est impeccable et leurs cocktails sont insanes :) belle découverte !"}
{"text":"Went with a group of 6 and two kids for dinner. Amazing food, amazing atmosphere, amazing service! They waiter took care of the food for us and they did a fantastic job! For starters we had Croquetas de jamón, calamari, cravlax de trucha which was to die for...,octopus so tender and nice, shrimp cocas. We had the paella and flank steak which was very juicy for main which we shared. loved the starters but my personal favourite was the marinated trout with the caviar! They also had great wine to chose from. I would def go to this place again!"}
{"text":"Sorry, but I have to say, there is nothing extraordinary here, $20.00 for an ordinary eggs over easy,breakfast and a cup of tea, is a bit much; not to mention I was still hungry, and I did have something before attending. I might not be a plus-sized woman, but hey, I do need to eat! 
The place itself is very nicely laid out, and very inviting, service adequate, but I'll restrict my brunch venues to places where you actually can get fed for half the price."}
{"text":"Super atmosphère et décor très tendance! Nous avons reçu un service impeccable, et le menu, typiquement espagnol, était original avec plein de saveurs atypiques."}
{"text":"Went her for Brunch with a small group. Very friendly and good service.  Loved the menu, it had a little bit of a Spanish twist on ordinary breakfast places.  Makes one want to go out more for Brunch! Food was well presented and tasty. I'm looking forward on going back for Dinner."}
{"text":"It's a Spanish restaurant with a nice decoration and few items on the menu, which facilitates the picking. I went there with my family. The waiters were helpful and polite.
We had as Entrantes (starters) the Croquetas de jamón; Serrano and béchamel croquettes, 
a Cocas, which is a Catalan pizza version with mushroom and homemade sausage, and
a Pulpo a la gallega; Octopus, smoked paprika and potatoes. They were both delicious!!!
As for the main courses I was personally deceived, as I didn't taste the Spanish flavors I was expecting. 
We ordered a Zarzuela, which is a seafood casserole with cod, shrimp, mussels and potatoe bouillabaisse,
and a Paella a la Mesón; Bomba rice with chicken, shrimp, clams, mussels, chorizo, tomatoes and green peas.
Finally, if you wanna eat Spanish for a change, you can go there and pick the starters."}
{"text":"Ah, yes, Restaurant Meson. Very hip place, nice bar that opens up onto the kitchen so you can see the chef, Marie-fleur St-Pierre, do her magic. Owned by the same folks that started Tapeo just down the street, Meson goes for spanish fare, but in a more traditional restaurant style (entrée, mains, deserts).

We started with Calamares con salsa bravas, Tartar de atun (tuna tartare), ensalada de tomates, manchego, pay y datiles and de legumbres. Fantastico! Squid was cooked to perfection, and the tomato sauce that went with it a sublime compliment. The tomato, date and cheese salad was a dynamic mix as well, with the sweetness from the date, the acid from the tomatoe and the sharpness of monchego cheese mix together in the mouth in an 'oh wow!' combination that's frankly hard to describe, other than being a wonderful new taste experience.

We followed those with two Cocas (specialty breads), one with sausage & mushroom, the other with sardines, peppers and an egg yolk. Yummy! The choice of mains was pretty eclectic; my son chose Pierna de cordero (Jarret d'agneau); my daughter and my son's girlfriend chose Canelones a la Catalana (Cannelloni de veau, poulet & foie de volaille); I had the Bacalo al horno (Morue au four) while my wife had the Bouillabaise espagnole. Double yummy!! All washed down with a couple of bottles of Valdeorros 2011 (a white) and it was a gastronomically spectacular evening! Well worth it, if you have the time to try something a bit different.

Service was excellent, very attentive, friendly and willing to roll with whatever the table wanted. If you want a spanish-influenced dinner, go quick. It's worth getting yourself there."}
{"text":"Money money money moneeeeey, moooonaaaaayyyy. Its a bit pricey but, BUT, super good. I had the tartare and my man had a cocas. Its a Spanish pizza. Both were solid. The mains are big portions so get ready to get your eat on. They spent coin on the decor and its a nice ambiance so, congrats. Cheesecake was yummy. Great date spot. You'll get a second date unless you're boring, Meson can't help you. Sorryyyyyy. (Not sorry). Definitely will be back to try more of the seafood dishes. A bientot!"}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant with a wide variety of Tapas. The experience is always better when you are a larger group. I went there with friends,  we were 6 and undecided,  so we told the waiter to choose for us,  it was the best decision ever,  we received a variety of plates that we probably wouldnt order but so tastefull.
My favorite was the Paella and the Octopuss,  we also had Salmon tartar, chorizo  and cocas (the portuguese version of a flatbread.  Definitely going back."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful meal here, sitting by the great big windows on the sweetest little green street. The wine was excellent, the cocas were my favourite - amazing savoury flat bread. The sardines and squid ink fish and chips were ok, but the flavours of the Serrano and Béchamel croquettes were on another level. We walked in to this more casual sibling of Tapeo without a reservation midweek in the Spring and were welcomed by chill friendly staff who made us feel welcome all night. A kind of pricey but delicious dinner in a lovely calm atmosphere, very nice for date night."}
{"text":"Such a nice staff to go with absolutely yummy food. But seriously though, those churros..."}
{"text":"Ordinaire en général...

Premièrement; j'étais assis au bout d'une table et les serveurs n'arrêtaient pas de m'accrocher. Ce qui peut teinter ma perception, je l'avoue.
Deuxièmement; le menu ne me parlait pas. La nourriture était bonne, sans plus. La facture salée. Le serveur se prenait pour je ne sais pas qui et ça me tapait royalement sur les nerfs. Je n'allais pas voir \" Cyrano de Bergerac \", je voulais souper avec mes amis.
Troisièmement; la musique était forte et je n'entendais à peu près pas mes amis à l'autre bout de la table (7 personnes). Ils n'étaient pas l'autre bout du monde.
Pour conclure; ma première impression des lieux, qui s'annonçait plus que favorable, s'est volatilisée. Même s'il y a très bons avis pour ce restaurant, c'est un rendez-vous manqué pour moi. Et, je n'en suis pas désolé.

Dommage..."}
{"text":"Vive l'Espagne et la chef Marie-Fleur At-Pierre! 
Savoureuse cuisine d'influence espagnole. 
Petit frère du restaurant Tapeo, on aime!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. It says brunch but it's also great for dinner. Loved the appetizers, the meals were fresh and tasty. I wasn't a fan of their pallela but it was good. My friends meals tasted delicious. Def recommend"}
{"text":"Trendy restaurant with a great atmosphere and beautiful food, however rather boring and overpriced.

We were here to celebrate a birthday on a Friday evening- the location is ideal for an intimate celebration since the restaurant is small yet there are long booths along the wall that can accompany a group.

We had a sampling of the fried calamari, secreto iberico (pork) dish and Fideuá de bacalao (noodles/fish).

The appetizer of the calamari was the highlight of the evening, delicious and fresh, it could not be matched to our main meals. The pork was good, but priced at 40$ and served with tiny cherry tomatoes, it looked disappointing. For such a simple and cheap type of meat, I can't imagine what was so special about the pork, it didn't even melt in my mouth.

My Fideua was also kind of joke, it looked like asian rice noodles simmered in leftover fishy broth with a small piece of cod in the middle. The whole thing was fishy and boring. I expected something more unique, I couldn't believe this dish was \"spanish\" and the value certainly wasn't there either.

We have been to so many other places that serve better, more tender meat and I've have better rice noodles at home, so walking out of there with a bill that was over 100$ (we didn't even get drinks or dessert) I felt ripped off. A popular chef behind the name and a beautiful decor don't justify the food unfortunately."}
{"text":"Only went for breakfast but left generally disappointed and ripped-off, like a lot of brunch places in Montreal.

You would expect to discover something new here (or at least an extra oumph) given the pedigree of the place but what came out of the kitchen was just as you would get anywhere else.  Portions were just ok.

BUYER BEWARE: no filtered coffees here so $4 + tx + tip every time you want to re-up.

Will not be going back for brunch."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant de la chef Marie St-Pierre (du Tapeo)

À découvrir si vous aimez la cuisine Espagnole."}
{"text":"I went there twice for brunch before writing this review. Great space, food tastes good. Unfortunately, service is not too impressive and the food is too expensive for what we received. Presentation is average and the sides were almost unexisting with the eggs. I felt hungry after eating my plate. We ordered the churros which are good but you don't want that in the morning. Giving the reputation of the chef, I was expecting to be blown away. For the price, there are better options out there. I'll try one last time for dinner."}
{"text":"I Know the brunch menu looks fairly simple and the decor from outside looks fairly \"bobo chic\" like most of the restaurants/cafes here. However, this place is different because it does just a little bit better on all criteria: food was excellent, both presentation+taste+price range; the decoration gives more than just a hipster vibe- it's good quality stuff, especially the cellar. And the service is fast & friendly. Would love to come back for dinner."}
{"text":"Feeling like eating Spanish food (Paella or zarzuela), Meson is the place to go. I've been there twice for diner. The menu is straight forward. You do not have many options. This allows the restaurant to focus on few dishes that end up very good.
I ordered the Paella. It is well-stocked with chicken, shrimp, clams, mussels, chorizo, tomatoes and green peas.
I also tasted the Zarzuela. The cod, shrimp, mussels and potato bouillabaisse where marinated in a delicious spicy sauce.
The restaurant is cosy. They have a nice bar. I posted a pic of it. What I also like is the industrial design luminaire. 
We also need to mention that the service is impeccable. They were able to handle a table of eight people on a Friday night with no delays in serving the food. Lets not forget the waiters that are very professional and helpful.
Overall Meson is a good place to dine on a weekend with friends or if you're on a date.
I only have one comment to make. Even though they have a big wine cellar, they also need to focus on beer. They only serve 1/2 Pint glasses. They need to go for the pint."}
{"text":"Wow !  Tout à fait excellent. Très bel endroit. Ambiance chic / décontractée. Chaude recommandation !"}
