{"text":"Very good buffet restaurant.  Excellent food ...better than tandoori flame.....good selection and great service.  Ample amount of food and naan bread is brought fresh to your table.  Chats.salads. veg and non veg apps and mains. Ice creams and pizza. They have it all....you have to see it to believe it.  Great value as well."}
{"text":"This was our second visit in 2 weeks.The veg and non-veg selection is awesome and we found every dish to be very tasty. Masala Dosas are excellent. For the price of $10-$12 the value is exceptional. The hostess Rajnee is so kind and considering how busy it was, her attentiveness and genuine warmth made our dining experience extra special. All the servers are very polite. You will not be disappointed with this place. Weeekends seem busy so make a reservation or you may have to wait."}
{"text":"This is new favourite Indian buffet. Price is right. Food is delicious. Service was great.what more do you."}
{"text":"The food is good keeping in mind this is a buffet place.

Their lunch buffet is quite cheap even the dinner is not expensive. The full menu includes but is not limited to...Pakistani, Indian, Hakkah Chinese cuisines. It was quite impressive the design area included a Salad Bar, Vegetarian dishes area, Non Vegetarian dishes area, Fried area, dessert area.

Some unusual tasty stuff included were Masala Dosas, golgappa/Panipuri, gulab jamun. The place is nicely decorated and quiet big, so space wont be a problem. Parking is free.

Overall, Good Place many choices and easy on the pocket.

For my Muslim peeps! They \"don't\" serve halal meat."}
{"text":"We went on a Wednesday night to a slightly busy restaurant - food quality was great and service was up to speed as well. Good selection of veggie and non-veggie items. The dessert section is pretty good for an Indian restaurant that usually serves dried up ice cream and old gulab jamun. Nonstop naan was an added plus. Definitely will go back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! I came here based on the reviews. Dinner buffet was $12.99 and definitely a good bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Wonderful food! Huge selection! Reasonable price!

We had a wonderful lunch buffet at Desi. The ambiance was nice and modern. The food was great, and there were extensive options at the buffet table. Everything was delicious. The butter chicken and chicken tikka masala are personal favorites, as well as gulab jamun for dessert. The weekday lunch buffet was $11.

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the largest vegetarian selection Indian Buffet I've ever had to date! My partner and I came here for lunch and we loved it! The waitresses were very hospitable. There is a whole bar dedicated to vegetarian. My favourite is the Aloo gobi, their version has peas in it. My partner loved the butter chicken. Beautiful flavours without being salty. I was slightly disappointed with the red curry goat as I was a bit watery and not as flavourful as the other dishes. Overall the food was very mild. We're spicy people and it's nice that they have hot sauce to accommodate that. We still feel that a little heat would improve the overall experience. Currently it's too mild."}
{"text":"This is great place,  not menu service only buffet, food was delicious good and friendly bus service and great value."}
{"text":"Took my family here for dinner. There was plenty of veg and meat options to please everyone. Probably the largest selection of veg curries I have seen in an Indian buffet (well executed that is - here's looking at you Tandoori Flame). 

For the price point, I don't think you can find a better Indian buffet in the GTA. 

We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Decided to try Desi Spice mainly because of the reasonable price for an all you can eat buffet ($12.99).  When I read the reviews and saw all the positives I figured it would be a small investment to lose if the place didn't meet with my expectations.  The place exceeded my expectations.  The atmosphere and ambiance was great.  Indian music got our feet tapping.  The staff are very helpful and friendly.  I give the place two thumbs up for cleanliness.  The food was spectacular.  There is a huge assortment of vegetarian dishes as well as non-vegetarian.  Tandoori chicken was awesome, two kinds of goat curry.  I didn't eat any of the cake type desserts but had ice cream.  I loved the banana and chocolate ice cream combination.  The fruit was fresh and sweet.  Defiantly recommend Desi Spice and my go to place when I need an Indian food fix."}
{"text":"Holy moly!! A 10$ buffet with the freshest if foods and over 120 different food items... 

Everything is awesome !!"}
{"text":"Great meat and vegetarian selections. Fresh naan to the table. Amazing fish pakora and sag paneer, prompt service and comfortable seating in a very clean restaurant. And best of all, just $10 for lunch buffet!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time yesterday and was pretty impressed. The atmosphere inside is very comfortable, and the selection of food for the buffet was also great! I did not expect it to be as big as it was but was pleasantly surprised. In terms of the taste of the food,  I enjoyed a lot of what I ate. The cakes were hard to bite into, so I'm guessing they were super stale but the gulab jamuns and ras malai were on point. I paid about 15 for dinner with tax so it wasn't a bad deal at all! This place gets pretty busy around 7 or 8 .. so we were glad we went a little earlier."}
{"text":"This place was utterly disgusting, the food was colder than my ex's heart. The fries were staler than a bag of 5 week old chips. I can't express how disappointed I am, not to mention I feel like fluids are going to leak out of every hole in my body. DONT EAT HERE. Run while you can."}
{"text":"Wow. Needed to find a place close by to eat so this place was a lucky find. Great curry dishes, dessert, and they bring fresh naan and other items to you. Sweet and sour fish was a lot of meat with minimal batter. All dishes were fresh and desserts galore."}
{"text":"For the first time in long while I found an Indian Buffet worth a review. I saw the reviews on Yelp so I decided to give the place a try. For a ten buck lunch buffet it was pretty impressive. Salad bar. Ice cream, Indian desserts and four hot tables loaded with delicious Indian cuisine.  Wide selection from chicken Kebobs to deep fried Indian fish. Did I mention ten buck?!  Great for veggers and meteors.  We got there right at 12 and it was great.  No line ups but most importantly, fresh food. Naan made to order. Must tries are the Goat Curry, chicken Kebobs and fried fish.  I hope this just isn't a grand opening thing and they keep this spread going all year round.  Comfy modern decor sets it all together nicely.  Go check this place out and tell me what you think. I give it a big three stars. I will be back for consistency checks and hopefully the same quality of good delicious chow!"}
{"text":"My wife and I wanted to have Indian since a long time. After much googling and reviews on Yelp, our cravings finally brought us to Desi Spice. I would only hope my review would add to the many accolades Desi spice has recieved, because the food was delumptious. They had an extensive menu which is a Happy news for your yummy tummy. The ladies in black were awesome and very friendly. Overall experience was great with good pricing too. Would definitely recommend to all Indian cuisine lovers."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Indian buffet I've been to (tried two other ones) and will be my go-to Indian buffet place from now on! Was here on a Saturday night around 6:30 pm and although they were steadily getting busier, the service was top notch; The server came by frequently to clear the plates and ask if we needed anything (naan, napkins, water).

The naan was so fresh and delicious! Warm and perfectly chewy with just the right amount of crispiness at the bottom. Oh and we mustn't forget the generous brush of butter to finish it off - so yummy!

I didn't try any of the meat dishes but I would highly recommend the paneer tiki masala (a little sweeter than I like it but still delicious), curry pakora (the curry was creamy with a nice tang, and the pakoras were very flavourful and had a great texture), and saag paneer (spinach based).

The sweet and sour fish was also very tasty! A tad on the salty side but I assume it's so that it can be enjoyed with rice. The samosas were your run-of-the-mill *good* samosas; I enjoyed them.

The only reason I don't give this place a 5 star rating is because of their desserts. They had only a small selection and nothing stood out. If you're going to have a small dessert selection, make sure everything is top quality. The rasmalai was tough and chewy like it's either overcooked or old; it wasn't that nice soft and spongy texture that I love). The cakes were all stale and flavourless (who comes here for cake but still), fresh fruit wasn't very fresh, and the canned fruit mix looked and tasted like it has been out for a while). The mango ice cream was good though!

Overall, this place serves high quality food (minus the desserts) and provides excellent service at an unbeatable price! $12.99 for weekend lunch and $14.99 for weekend dinner.  Total with tax and tip came to $40 - AMAZING!!"}
{"text":"Lunch buffet is just $10 ($10.99 on weekends) and dinner is $12 ($12.99 on weekends) so the value is simply unbeatable. But not if the food isn't good but that's not a problem! The food is outstanding!!!

It's a fairly wide assortment of your usual Indian favorites, and always fresh in my experience. And most importantly, delicious!

Desi Spice has become my new go-to Indian place. I very highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Thanks to super-Yelper, Anthony N., for turning us on to Desi Spice! 

 I normally avoid Indian buffets but eating with my son and husband, Quantity takes priority over Quality. At Desi Spice, we can have both Quantity and Quality...and for a great price.

Apart from their wide selection of dishes, Desi Spice offers a palate-pleasing array of paneer-based items (eg shahi paneer, paneer tikka masala, palak paneer, matar paneer etc) and sag-based items (eg sag paneer and sag gosht). While my 2 meat-loving men satisfied their carnivorous cravings, I made my own thali by filling small bowlfuls of various paneers and sag dishes and enjoying them with veg pulao and fresh nan. 

For dessert, I enjoyed the warm gulab jamun but had to skip the rasmalai and fruit (getting too full!) I didn't see the panipuri station until after I had devoured my gulab jamun so panipuri became my 2nd dessert. :-)

The best time for dinner is at the beginning of dinner service, 6 pm. Yelp states that dinner starts at 5 pm but that's incorrect.

Looking forward to our next meal at Desi Spice..."}
{"text":"This place has a great selection and a great variety of vegetarian dishes, which are usually lacking in most buffets. 
The non vegetarian dishes very cooked very well. 
To top it off, I love both their naan (so fresh) and their dosas."}
{"text":"Etobicoke general's hospital cafeteria is closed on weekends. Came to this plaza to get Greek and stumbled upon this place and so glad I did. Weekend buffet is only $12. Delicious, flavourful, quality food (Esp for buffet) for great value! Appies, vegetarian mains, chicken/goat mains, dessert, fruit, salad/cold pasta bar, fresh naan. Chicken tiki marsala and the butter chicken were my fav. Spacious seating area, good for parties, lots of parking. Would return and would def recommend to anyone who is skeptical about giving it a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"They have a lot of items love their food very presentable and taste good and the price is reasonable I would reccomend everyone to go here it is worth it you won't be disapponted"}
{"text":"Great food and service at a very good price. They also serve fresh dosa which isn't common for a mid price buffet place. Great variety of deserts as well! My favourite indian buffet place by far."}
{"text":"Came here with my family on a Sunday. Pretty good buffet for the price of $12 for dinner. A really good selection of food, veg and non-veg. Butter chicken, chicken tikka masala, chicken curry, goat curry, kebabs, tandoori chicken, fish pakora, paneer, gulab jamun, ras malai, ice cream, and more. Naan is okay. Comes out as requested which is nice. Wait staff were very friendly and attentive. Overall I would recommend it and probably come back again."}
{"text":"Largest selection of Indian food I have ever had and the food is great. Staff is so friendly and offers you to try various things they freshly made. Price is good.

Definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"Good buffet.Lot of varieties and option for both Veg and Non Veg.10 desert varieties.Lot of non veg options.Chat and pani Puri.Fresh naan to table.Good numbers of appetizers.Worth for price.Must try.Definetly will recommend this place"}
{"text":"Same taste but for the small price you could have many dishes.The staff are students they are doing bit well but there is room for improvement."}
{"text":"This place was great! Lots of delicious choices, with a lot of the choices not being too spicy, as well as friendly amd welcoming staff.

The environment was also quiet and relaxing. Simple decoration but a comforting place in general. I would definitely recommend this place for its food and IT'S BUFFET PRICE. Man oh man, I am stuffed :p"}
{"text":"Amazing lunch time buffet. Eggplant dishes were amazing, lots for the little ones to eat if they are not into these dishes"}
{"text":"Amazing place. Came here with 3 friends after a long day out and it really hit the spot. The price was great for a buffet and so was the food! Adding to my list of regular restaurants for sure."}
{"text":"I was in the area and happened to crave Indian food. Even though I had some reservations at first, Desi Spice didn't disappoint. The weekday price for person is fair, given the quantity and quality of food. Sure, the quality of food is not the same as at some of the best Indian restaurants in Brampton, but it's fair and acceptable. I had no problems with the level of spiciness. All the food was very tasty and flavourful.

The only thing I didn't like was their tacky dark decor. I think the interior designer went overboard with dark colours. The owners might want to borrow design cues from the guy who owns Bhai's Indian Canteen (8-115 York Blvd in Richmond Hill).

Would I be back? Absolutely, if I happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I got violent food poisoning here on Feb 17, 2017 (started within 6-8 hours of eating dinner). I think it has to do with the large size of the food trays, since the restaurant isn't huge, there isn't enough turnover. The meat dishes probably sit there lukewarm all day. The selection was good, and the food taste was ok for an Indian buffet, but nothing special. Price was good. Unfortunately I can't go back here again after that."}
{"text":"Much better than Shahi Mahal which was the previous restaurant in this building.

Better selection and good service. 

For $10 lunch and $12 dinner, definitely a great place to eat in."}
{"text":"This is the best Indian buffet I have found to date. They have an expansive selection of curries, dessert, among others. The dishes are well spiced and fresh. The lunch buffet is 11.99 and I think the dinner is 12.99 which is such a steal! You get way more selections for less cost where can you go wrong? Even though I live on the east end, I drive all the way here to eat at Desi Spice. It's such good value, I totally recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Good options for vegetarians. They serve hot dosa in buffet and plenty of non vegetarian including goat, chicken and fish. Barring the fried fish, the starters arent great but this buffet is still a great deal for the price. They have a DIY chat section with panipuri etc. The butter chicken, sweet and sour fish, chicken tikka are wonderful. Cant say the same about their goat curries. They have 6 flavours of ice cream - they dont replenish mango, my favorite. The gulab jamuns and carrot halwa are to die for. 
The ambience is nice with comfortable chairs and nice lighting. It is a great choice for families. The waiters are courteous. Even though they had a 1.5 hour limit the waitresses did not rush us and let us take our time.  Overall, I enjoyed my Indian dining experience. The one star deduction was for the poor quality of starters. Will come back many times over if they keep the quality consistent."}
