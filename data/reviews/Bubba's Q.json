{"text":"Just wanted to say we had an amazing meal! We had a groupon for four and there was so much food. It was nice to be able to taste a little of everything. It was all delicious! Our waiter was James and he was such a nice guy. Thanks James for making it a great dining experience."}
{"text":"Long time yelper, first time poster.  Where to begin...  This was our first and probably last time at Bubbas. The hostess was very attentive to customers when they arrived. I was able to notice due to the 30 minute wait for what seemed to be a not so busy night, at least in my opinion. (I co-own a pizzeria in a tourist area so I know what volume is) The hostess sat 3 tables of two in front of my party of two. When I questioned her she had nothing to say. We were promptly seated in the enclosed patio on a picnic table (suitable for a BBQ place but not when you have to sit for 2+ hours).  We waited an additional 15 minutes to be greeted by a server. I don't like to compare apples to oranges (pizza to BBQ) but I think its fair to say that any restaurant has policies about greeting customers within X amount of time.   My first impression = not so good. Hopefully the food was better.  In fact it was... Aside from waiting an additional 15 minutes for potato skins appetizer...Hence my 2 star rating. I had the Deboned Ribs and they were excellent! My fianc√© had the brisket and it was decent. Edible but not phenomenal.   The food was the saving grace. Had it not been edible I would have walked out. It wasn't worth talking to a manager. I won't go back unless I have a groupon."}
{"text":"well..  I wanted to like it..but....  The server was a mess.  Got something on everyone of our table of 5's meal wrong...literally.  Draft beer was flat.  Got the brisket.  Was nice and tender but it taste like it was cooked in the oven!! Not a hint of smokiness.  Mac and cheese was not good...almost pastey consistency.  Baked beans were different but good.  One at our table ordered the boneless babybacks..but got regular... server was supposed to fix it.... 15 min later came back and said it wouild be another 10 min....  needless to say he ate the bone-ins.  Took forever to get the food then forever for the server to come back and bring the check.  And of course....checks were screwed up and wrong amounts charged to cards (and that was for the correctly calculated check)   Next time in Cleveland I will skip BBQ."}
{"text":"Today was my fourth visit since Bubba's opened in Avon Lake . Sad news,  but my last. Bubba, you need to mind the store. There weren't very many people in your resteraunt  but it still took over an hour for us to get a semi warm meal. Two whole orders of BabyBacks, a brisket, pulled pork sandwich, chicken sandwich, and a kids rib dinner, and chicken fingers. The baby backs were not BabyBacks ribs, they were ribs but not BabyBacks, the pulled pork portion barely made the edges of the bun, same with the brisket. The chicken fingers were overcooked to the point of being dry. The chicken sandwich was, ok.  And the kids rib meal was, ok.  Sorry but I can't recommend Bubba's."}
{"text":"Ate at Bubba's Q last weekend.  It was our first trip there, and probably our last.  I was really looking forward to eating there, but didnt have time to check reviews ahead of time.  Overall, the ribs were decent, but the service and high prices made it a dissappointing experience.  They were busy, so it took about 40 minutes to get a table.  The waitress was friendly, but not very good.  She didnt seem to be firing on all cylinders if you know what I mean and would dissapear for long stretches of time.  She made mistakes on our drink and dinner order, and it took over 30 minutes to get our food.  The ribs were tasty, but needed more sauce. The portions for the side dishes were suprisingly small.  Dont expect more than 1/4 cup portion of cole slaw or baked beans - defintely not enough for sharing.  Also, the prices are quite expensive for what you get.  If I go back, it will be for take out only - the service was that dissapointing for us.  Slow roasted barbeque = slow and sloppy service."}
{"text":"This place isn't fancy but it is fun and you will like it.  I'd give it an easy four stars but I'm offended by the prices.  Of course there really aren't any other options for good BBQ around, are there?  I have never had such juicy, flavorful fried chicken.   You should definitely try it if you like southern food but be prepared for sticker shock when you read the menu. You'll forget about the prices briefly because you'll enjoy the food but afterwards you'll wonder if Bubba realizes being an NFL lineman nets a different salary than a Lorain County restaurant owner."}
{"text":"I was craving a pulled prok sanwich so we got takeout - wrong move.  I took a bite out of my sandwich and the roll was still RAW, like raw dough and gooey - gross! The pulled pork was ok, but nothing out of the ordinary.  The fries were undercooked, but hey I didn't go for the fries.  Our side was baked beans, another mediocre disappointment.  I have to say for the price, I'd go to 2 bucks and get their pulled pork tacos the next time I am craving pulled pork - way better at a fraction of the price."}
{"text":"Oh my...where to begin?  From the moment we walked in, to the moment we left, there was not one thing that went without a glitch.  Lowlights include: 1. The unhappy hostess who insisted on putting our name on a list even though there was one other couple in front of us and four empty tables.  2.  The waitress with the dirty shirt who took 10 minutes to take our drink order and then forgot to bring our drinks.  3.  The \"brisket bites\" swimming in sauce and sadly the best thing we had to eat.  4.  The two full slabs of ribs that were mysteriously dry to the bone, tough, and not even worth taking a full slab of leftovers home.  (And I love almost all things BBQ) 5.  The side dishes that tasted like they came from a can.  I was really wanting to like Bubba-Q's, being a fan of Al 'Bubba' Baker and my beloved Browns, but must admit that this is a restaurant that needs a top-to-bottom overhaul. Clearly, poorly managed and not worth the 30 minute drive."}
{"text":"Atmosphere not bad with lots of sports memorabilia. Tables are very close together and we could hear other guests conversations.   On the food front there is nothing to write home about. Very greasy bbq and portions are not what they are at other places. We ordered the MVP for four people which was $56. The amount of food was equal to two entrees at a regular chain. I would not mind paying more if the bbq was great but it wasn't.   Also one thing I did not like is they charge for extra roles. I don't mind a place doing this but when the food is already extremely overpriced, it's a problem.   All in all it wasn't terrible but I would not recommend. There are just too many GREAT places to eat in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Stopped here on way home from a trip to New England.  This was the very worse bbq we have ever had.  Service was slow, food was bad, the cornbread is awful.  Don't waste your time or money.  huskeyman"}
{"text":"Bubba if your listening. I happened to have a very poor experience a while back. My family and I walked in later in the evening. We had to seat our selves. The 2 people seated after us ordered and received their order before ours and we had ordered before them. Additionally, We must of been forgotten because after over an hour of waiting we paid for what we had received our drinks only and left. I could not believe what we experienced.......one day I may return but for now Famous Daves is waiting in North Olmsted."}
{"text":"The food is great, the atmosphere is even better. They mixed up my order once and they fixed it and gave us the goof to take home. I am a huge fan of the beef."}
{"text":"DO NOT BUY THE RAFFLE TICKETS ON FRIDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHTS!  A group of 4 of us had dinner there on 3/19, the food was OK.  During dinner it was announced that the restaurant was having a \"50/50\" raffle for a local cause.  They explained that this raffle is held every Friday and Saturday night for different causes and they usually collect about $1,000.00 so the winning ticket gets about $500.00.  Tickets were $1.00 each and the drawing would be held at 9:30.  Everyone at our table bought tickets and when I asked what charity would benefit I was told \"Everyone Counts and it helps homeless people\".  There was no drawing at 9:30 and when we questioned when it would be, we were told that when some woman came in the next morning, she would pull the ticket.  This is no way to conduct a fundraising raffle and there should be more transparency if they are collecting money for charity."}
{"text":"I am a HUGE Browns fan and when I heard that Al \"Bubba\" Baker had a place, I HAD to go.  I was and am not let down every time I make the trip to Avon.  Full of sports memorabilia and several screens to watch whatever sports event is going on, it is so worth it.  My mom and grandma love the St. Louis ribs and my boyfriend is working his was through all of them.  Me, I go for the mac and cheese.  THE BEST MAC AND CHEESE   I HAVE HAD SO FAR!  I love the fried chicken too.  You can only get half or whole, and I swear they are Dolly Parton chickens!   The breasts are that big.  The deserts are killer too.  Bubba himself works here and will seat, cook, greet, and bus tables , which to me says a lot to this place and that  is that he is not just a name on the door.  They also do catering.  If I ever need a caterer, I'm going with them.  2-20-11 Update:  Not too happy with the place as of the date listed above.  We went  on the 20th to celebrate the boyfriends b-day and it was NOT a 5 star experience!  It was more like a 3, which is NOT normal for the place.  They were out of St. Louis ribs (they were in the smoker), there were no cornbread mini muffins (which it is worth going just for those) and they were out of both Sierra Mist and lemonade, which I find a little hard to believe.  Service left a lot to be desired, and yes they were busy, but I have been there when it has been slammed and had better service.  My mom had the fried chicken and her thigh was under cooked.  My grilled breast was a little dry, but the boyfriend said that his sliders were really good and grandma said the baby backs were very meaty.  A sign was posted looking for experienced help, so that may have been part of the problem.  Will this keep me from going back, no.  Every one has an off day.  If it keeps happening, yes I will stop going."}
{"text":"Let me say that I lived in the Deep South for several years so I have more than a passing acquaintance with barbecue. I had been here twice before, a few years ago. I tried to go about a month ago but it was so crowded they told me it was a three-hour wait. So three of us went tonight (Thursday after Christmas) and seating was no problem, only two other tables in use. Getting seated was harder. We stood around for about five minutes before I went to the service window to get their attention.  The menu was much pricier than I remember. A basic pork plate with two sides was $14.00. Other entrees were similar. That's what I had, as did another of our party. The other had a pork sandwich with fries ($8.00). The pork was OK, not real tasty but tender, except for a few outside pieces that should have been trimmed. It came with a side of BBQ sauce, not mixed with the pork. The sauce was tomato based and fairly tame. I had french fires (OK) and baked beans (moderately warm, very small portion). There was no extra BBQ sauce at the table.  The meal was served with a bread basket with three rolls that seemed a bit stale and about five mini corn muffins that were a bit greasy and turned to mush in your mouth.  But the biggest problem was the service. One waitress, who was also the one that eventually seated us. Food was served quickly but there was no check back to our table during the meal. We were all obviously finished and the waitress came over and struck up a five-minute conversation at the next table before taking their order, then disappeared into the kitchen for another five minutes. She came back out and then asked if we wanted wanted soft drink refills (we didn't).  Total bill, $40.47 for three. Overpriced and underwhelmed."}
{"text":"We went to Bubba'sQ before reading the reviews and I'm glad we did.  The BBQ was delicious. We had the MVP for 2 and the various meats were melt in your mouth tender.  The sides are standard BBQ fare with coleslaw, beans and corn muffins -- certainly not gourmet but tasty.    The wait staff was friendly and service was fast.  Oh, and the beer is ice cold. :)  We are visiting from out of state and will definitely dine at Bubba's again."}
{"text":"Their Facebook page, Google search and front door of the restaurant say it's open till 10pm Saturday. We walked in at 8:45pm and were told by the hostess they were closed. When we asked why because it's clearly posted 10pm, her answer was \"we usually close at 9\" and said she'd ask. A man came out as we were walking out and said they were \"out of food\" (really...ALL of your food?). Mind you there were people still dining inside and servers bringing food out to tables. Judging by the excuses I'm pretty sure they just wanted to go home early. We will not be going back. Good service is if you're open till 10pm or even 9pm you seat customers till that time. And if you're \"out of food\" put a sign on the door or post on your FB page."}
{"text":"Kind of bright in the dinning room. A little more dim at night would be good. Server was fast but kinda disappeared after our food was out. The salad with our meal was good sized and decent tasting. The only real issue we had were the sides and the corn bread. They could use some help. I'd like to see a home made like corn bread it tasted like it was from a box...maybe some jalape√±o cornbread. The baked beans and mac and cheese were decent but could be kicked up a notch kinda bland. We had french fries we had were very bland...A natural cut fry would be really good or maybe some potatoe wedges seasoned up real good? The other issue was two 22oz Labatt beers were 6.50 each on a slow Sunday night!? That said this place had the most delicous bbq meats I've ever had and I lived in the south for 4 years! The meats made up for all the little things we didn't care for as much. Worth it especially if you get a Groupon or on a day with deals. WILL go again actually buying another Groupon right now for Christmas for me and my dad!"}
{"text":"We had a pleasant experience. The place has fun decor and nice staff. The food was on point -- particularly the BBQ sauce. Portions weren't huge, either, which is a nice changeup from most places that slop tons of food at you. Mac and cheese was great. We vowed to put this on \" our list\" for when we return to visit family in Ohio."}
{"text":"Bubba's serves the best barbecue I've ever had. It is located on the Avon-Avon Lake border on Center Rd (OH-83). It is a fun restaurant with three main dining area, an indoor dining room, an outdoor covered patio, and an exposed patio. The covered patio has a fireplace and the exposed patio has a fire pit. You can see the trailers where the barbecue is cooked out back. That's just one proof of the authenticity of the BBQ. But we'll get back to that. Inside, there is a lot of football memorabilia, especially of \"Bubba\" when he played. There are a lot of reviews of the restaurant and the sauce on the walls too. Bubba is often spotted walking around talking with customers. Unfortunately, he left shortly after we arrived. The food was unbelievable. First, we had some hockey mozzarella sticks, which tasted the way mozzarella sticks, or triangles in this case, should taste. For my entree, I had the Baby Back Ribs, which were to die for! The ribs were so tender, they fell right off the bone. The meat was perfect. No wonder the sauce is a hit nationwide, it's perfect! The mac and cheese and the fries on the side were also excellent. I wouldn't have changed a thing about the meal. I had snickers cheesecake for dessert, which was also spectacular! The only complaint I had about the whole evening was the slow service, which was understandable due to the Saturday night rush and forgotten when we finally got our dinner. Overall, if you have a craving for BBQ in NE Ohio, run, don't walk to Bubba's. I guarantee you'll be satisfied!"}
{"text":"I used to live around some of the best BBQ in the world, and I know I'm not going to get near that quality of delicious smoked meat in northern Ohio, but this was not good even by Ohio standards. That the portions are so large only highlights the poor quality, since you get so much disappointment on each plate. My pulled chicken was so dry that it was hard and inedible in parts. The brisket tasted like a Steak-Um (remember those?) with sauce. My boyfriend said the ribs tasted like they were from Chili's, but they at least seemed moist. The sauce was good enough to only offer one flavor, which is typical outside of Ohio. The problem with the sauce is they are super-stingy with it, which sucks for you when the meat is exceedingly dry and tasteless. Best part of dinner: the Southern fries with pulled pork. Basically fries with cheese, sauce, and your choice of meat. Also, they offer a few beers on tap and in bottles, which was nice to help wash down the dry meat. Plus it made me tipsy enough that, through mathematical error, I left our waitress an exceedingly large tip on what was already a shockingly high bill for dinner."}
{"text":"Had dinner with friends.  I was skeptical as I had read bad reviews from a couple of years ago, all pertaining to the service.  We all ordered the boneless ribs and I had the mac and cheese as a side.  The food was excellent and our server Asha was awesome!!  She was very attentive, friendly and had a great sense of humor!   I will be back!"}
{"text":"Bummer. Couldn't seat us so we left.  25-30 min wait and not enough servers for outside.   Based on what it looked like and the menu options it let us 5o believe it would have been good!"}
{"text":"Walked in and was immediately disappointed by the atmosphere. It was so brightly lit it felt like I was in a fast food restaurant or school cafeteria. I waited about 5 minutes for the host to put my name on a list. Was seated shortly after. After a few minutes the waitress comes over, apologizes for taking so long because they are understaffed and then tells us they are out of the bone out ribs. This is their signature item! When I try a new restaurant I always want to try the most well known thing on their menu and they didn't have the de-boned ribs, so we ordered the baby back ribs instead. The Mac n Cheese was good, the beef brisket was really good, their barbeque sauce is very good. The ribs were very meaty, but not tender at all. Tough to pull apart. The flavor was very good though. I luckily had a groupon, because this seemingly very casual fast food looking place is quite high priced! The bill for 2 meals and 2 beers would have been over 45 dollars! The most shocking part... here's where I feel like I got robbed... I ordered a sam adams Octoberfest. Bill comes, the price: 8 dollars! Yep, 8 dollars, at a little casual place outside of Cleveland Ohio. I expect 8 dollars in New York City, Los Angeles, fancy Airport bars, etc, but not at a little casual joint in a suburb so far outside of Cleveland it is almost country.   In short: The food was good, but meat could have been more tender, but was a little overpriced and the beer was like a robbery. I never would have ordered an 8 dollar beer knowingly. And the atmosphere needs some dimmer lighting and the tables and chairs look very bland so something there."}
{"text":"I think other reviewers are pretty accurate.   I had the de-boned baby back ribs. They were good but not great. A bit charred in some spots but tender and reasonably lean for ribs. It is very strange that they don't have bottles of sauce on the table like the chains do, but rather give you a small cup. Of all things to skimp on, why the sauce?  My companion had beef brisket, which was mediocre. It tasted like a somewhat dry, thick sliced roast beef. Service was fine.   Our waitress was new and didn't know much, although another waitress inadvertantly came to our table and was much better until the first one came back and drove her away.  When asked, they weren't willing to modify their combos so you could try a selection of things you really wanted. Most restaurants are happy to accomodate special requests, within reason of course.  Yes, Bubba's is overpriced. For outstanding ribs, the pricing would be about right, but these were not outstanding. Before my Groupon discount, the bill was nearly $60, and that included one beer and one drink.   The verdict? Well, there isn't much in the area, so this place will continue to do well. I might even get carryout sometime."}
{"text":"Saint Louis Ribs were delicious, mac and cheese was okay, and the beans were horrible."}
{"text":"Very good ribs. Had both the baby back, and the St. Louis style. However the brisket was awful and the pulled pork was bad. Both tasted off, and as if they were microwaved, even though they were lukewarm at best. Our server was super nice."}
{"text":"I love the way the meat is cooked and spiced. I've had some ends of the ribs a bit too charred and they weren't very tasty, but in a better cut they  tasted tremendous thank you.  I appreciate the family atmosphere very much. And I am very proud of Bubba Smith as a Cleveland Brown, and he has a friendly, somewhat large, person I really appreciate. And admire .I will always wish him the best. This is one of my family's favorite spots to relax on the weekends,,  nsome very nice people."}
{"text":"We love us some Bubba's Q! We bring our relatives from Virginia ther ever time they visit. Great ribs!"}
{"text":"We had Bubba's come and cater our daughter's graduation party. The family is wonderful to deal with in advance as well as on site the day of. We served over 100 people and they raved about the food. Hats off to the Baker family for a first class job. Thank you!"}
{"text":"After a \"meh\" visit four years ago we decided to give it a second chance. Unfortunately, this meal was worse then the last. The combination of the poor food quality, the terrible service and prices make this a never, never again restaurant.  My husband summed it up \"It's pretty sad that a quick food chain (Dickey's) blows this place away\".   The \"expert from Texas\" of good BBQ can have Bubba's all to himself. I prefer something that tastes of quality and care.  Major complaints:  -Meat tasted reheated and ribs and chicken where overcooked and dry.  -My tween / teen children and I shared the MVP and we asked for our meat served without sauce, sauce on the side. Without sauce there was no detectable seasoning. If there was a dry rub on ribs or chicken I would be shocked. The brisket, however, was overly salty. The only thing that was properly seasoned was the pulled pork.  The meat was OK. I ate it because I was hungry but it far from the best BBQ that I have ever had.   - My husband's brisket was VERY fatty - not BBQ flavor fatty, plain ol' fatty. There was a 1/4 cup pile of fat left on his plate at the end the meal.  -The sides on the single dinner was TINY - condiment cup size. My side salad (@$2.99) was equally small. The corn muffin was the size of mini-muffin. The sides on the MVP where a cup to split between four people.   -The service was terrible. We had to ask for items multiple times and our server would disappear for extended periods of time.  The irony is that we could have driven to Dickey's in Parma, enjoyed a much better meal and returned back home in the same amount to time it took to eat at Bubba Q's. And for less money too boot."}
{"text":"I give it three stars for the simple fact that it is the best BBQ I've had in Cleveland, so far. However, saying that you're the best BBQ in Cleveland is like saying you were the tallest guy at the Little Person's Convention. This city is in serious need of a good barbeque place.  What kind of rib joint is so stingy with the sauce? I want a bottle of it on the table along with a roll of paper towels. The ribs were good, the pulled pork wasn't. I'd go there again, I just wouldn't go out of my way to do it."}
{"text":"We've always enjoyed Bubba Q's. Being from Kansas City, however, this isn't the best BBQ we've ever had, but it's the best we've found in Cleveland thus far. The sweet potato fries are to DIE for and the staff has always been very friendly when we visit!"}
{"text":"Ribs are excellent.  Customer service is NON-existent!  They don't answer phones or e-mail.  Tried multiple times with both.  Very disappointed.  Love the ribs but will never order again."}
{"text":"Been to Bubba's several times, but this is the first time I was disappointed! Service was excellent as always, but my ribs were barely warm!  I ended up eating my sides & 1/4 of my whole slab of boneless ribs, & took the rest home to heat & eat later. I still love this place. Maybe it was just an off day / night. So, I'll go back."}
{"text":"PROS: tasty bbq sauce, pulled pork, mac n cheese  CONS: served with very little sauce, slow service, terrible chili, very overpriced  PEEVE: had to ask for extra sauce and it took 10 min to get a tiny cup.  They need bottles of sauce on the table, along with extra napkins.  The basics just weren't met for a bbq place."}
{"text":"Over rated and sides served in tiny little ketchup cups. Really? Go to Moosehead in Amherst for real bbq."}
{"text":"We had a party of eight friends and were first time customers at Bubba's. Our server was great, but we were not very impressed with our ribs. Two of our party had the baby backs, which were fine, but the rest that ordered the St. Lewis ribs  were not happy. They were very dry and crunchy and had very little meat on them.  The tiny corn muffins were nothing special and the tiny plastic cups that the side of cole slaw came in was hardly a \"side\" at all. Maybe it was just an \"off\" night, but I don't think we will be making a return trip of about 45 minutes for us to have ribs there again."}
{"text":"ahh, had babyback ribs full slab ... taste wasn't bad, but they were very dry ... sauce was too sweet, way too sweet ... green beans were good, cold slaw was average ... dessert -- outsourced -- was good ... service was decent and waitress was friendly"}
{"text":"I want to give it a five stars but can't.  I personally think the food is great and the prices are about right for BBQ. Service was ver good.   The pulled pork, brisket, and ribs were perfect.  The best restaurant chili i've ever had.  Next time, though, I'd get water and order extra sides instead.  They get you on the drinks.  Five bucks for a small draft beer and over two bucks for tea is a bit pricey for this kind of place, and the prices weren't posted on the menus as far as i could tell. I really hate hidden charges like this.   If not for that I'd give it five stars.   I'll be back, though, and I'd recommend this restaurant with the above caveats."}
{"text":"Alway enjoy the dboned ribs. Took the family up here. Healthy portions friendly waiter. We had Sean. Will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Wow. Bubba, if you read this, please know that I write this as a first generation daughter of a highly successful restauranteur. Your restaurant needs help now. Service is beyond slow, tables need cleaning and it's been 20 minutes since we have talked to an employee. No water. No order in queue. We are staring into the TV hoping that someone will pay attention to us. A table of six just sat down and the waitress took their order.  In a few minutes, we will leave without dinner and not likely to return again. This place needs serious help."}
{"text":"Unfortunately during my recent order of ribs, brisket, mac/cheese and slaw; I found the following:  Brisket: Very long strand of hair: Gross.  Mac and Cheese: Finger Nail: Next level Gross.   I emailed the restaurant to make them aware and this is partial response:   \"...that there is absolutely no way that there was a finger nail in your Mac and cheese 1 no fake nails are allowed in our kitchen by our servers and staff and 2 our cooks wear gloves/hair nets and hats 100% of the time that they are in our kitchen the sauce mop sometimes sheds and the strands look like hair.\"  Bottom line as the customer, I have no ax to grind, I am not a liar and I know what I pulled out of my mouth eating mac/cheese. I also know the difference between a errant strand off of a BBQ mop vs a dark brown foot long strand of hair.   Hair nets and gloves are not Hazmat suits. To take the stance of impossibility is short sited and insulting.   If you are willing to look past this and still try Bubba's here is my review of the actual food: Ribs were meaty but a bit dry. Brisket was shredded and not sliced, and was packed in container with a ton of grease. Slaw and baked beans are very good.   Unfortunately, my days at Bubba's are over. Will travel to Lakewood and go to Proper Pig. Much better."}
{"text":"The food here is wonderful! I have eaten there 4-5 times and each time food has been great and the service very,very friendly! I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I have no idea how this place has a 3 star rating on here. Just ordered the sampler and some extra chili from grub hub. Food got here when they said and it was still warm. Ribs are bomb, brisket is bomb, pulled pork also bomb. Do you see the pattern? This place is 5 stars all day!"}
{"text":"Damn good BBQ.  As good as any place I've been to in Texas.    Don't miss the boneless bayback ribs.  Bubba roasts them over apple wood for 18 hours.  They're not cheap, but worth it."}
{"text":"Food was really good and restrooms were really clean.  Food prices were a bit high for the size of the portions."}
{"text":"De-boned ribs.  Seriously. Its like they knew I was coming. I wouldn't say this is the most phenomenal BBQ I've ever had, but any place that makes it easier for me to eat a food that is normally served on the bone is a-ok in my book. Service was a bit slow, but they were packed.  Prices seemed steep, but not too horribly so.  Sides were adequate-i found the condiment cup size of Mac and cheese to be enough for me.  All in all a decent outing, but nothing I would get too excited about.... well, except for the de-boned ribs that is."}
{"text":"3 stars for an average underwhelming meal. Nothing was bad, but everything needed work. I got pulled pork sliders. For my sides I got sweet potato fries and coleslaw. It also came with cornbread. Pork need some seasoning maybe, it was nothing special and sauce was thin and just ok. Sweet potato fries needed at least salt, but I've had way better prepared with cinnamon and sugar or even brown butter. Didn't care for coleslaw and only took one bite before passing it to Rick. Cornbread was dense and very dry. It's not that close and I don't know that I'd return."}
{"text":"The last time I dined here it was so long ago the only thing I remember about it was biting into a boneless rib to find a bone. That was enough for me to avoid this place all together. Thanks to groupon I was lured in again and decided to give them another chance. Their close to home and I really wanted to like this place.   There was no hostess, every single table up front was filled, so this was odd. After ten minutes of me getting ignored by all their busy servers, a gentlemen from the kitchen came out (in sweatpants and a t-shirt) asked how many of us there was and we followed him to our table. Strike one.   Our server was fine, other than it taking a while for our food, there are no other complaints there. But, another disgruntled patron actually called the police there due to some discrepancy with her bill. I have never seen this happen before, but due to the fact there is no manager in a full restaurant, I'm not shocked this is where the occurrence took place.   I had the fried chicken, it was salty and I felt some pieces were a little under cooked. The beef brisket was fine, but we didn't eat much of it at all. The boneless ribs were good and there were no surprises this time. I had the Mac n cheese and collard greens as sides. I added hot sauce and they were fine, but I expect better sides when I'm spending $25 a person (after tip and drink).   That other BBQ spot in North Olmsted will continue to get my business. I wouldn't care if my food was free, I'll pass."}
{"text":"To some, BBQ means sloppy, fatty, greasy, messy food. To me, BBQ is about taste and nothing else. I can handle a little mess, but with these ribs it's completely unavoidable. Everything is chok full of fat. So I'm guessing not the highest quality meats. The place is getting old and could use a few renovations(and staffing changes). Overall, the food is good, not great. But one of the strongest reasons I'm giving one star instead of 4 is that the place gets too political, every election season they plaster the outside in democratic party candidate stickers and signs. I don't care what you think or who you vote for, but when you're running a business, keep politics away. I refuse to eat here again. Any restaurant that values plastering Obama stickers everywhere over professionalism makes me question their conviction as an owner, and by default the quality and cleanliness of the food."}
{"text":"Food had to be a day old.  It was cold and dried out. We got the meal where everything was included. Then told as the food was brought to the table that they were out of somethings and they subbed it out, all without letting us know before hand.  Barely saw our waitress so we just ended up boxing it up and taking it home.  Threw the food out cause no one wanted to eat it.  Entire waste of time and money."}
{"text":"Freaking delicious! Pulled pork phenomenal. Baby backs best ribs in the area no doubt. St. Louis ribs are great also. Chicken was the most tender smoked chicken I've ever had. Bubba's is definitely the best barbeque spot in the area bar none."}
{"text":"If you like real BBQ ......this is the place!  Brisket, burnt end, pulled pork.  WOW.  Worth the drive from Chagrin Falls!  Actually ordered a large to go order to take home."}
{"text":"I read the reviews while waiting for my brisket sandwich and mac and cheese. The bad reviews about the food were too accurate. Honestly, I would rather go to Arby's than come back here. Microwaved rubbery and tasteless brisket. Elbow macaroni with velveta on it"}
{"text":"I am not a fan of ribs therefore I opted for a burger. The rest of my family got ribs and some of the ribs were not cooked throughly. Normally i would give a bad rating for this but the sauce is the reason it is getting 5 stars. The burger was delicious and once I dipped it in the barebque sauce it was even more delicious! This has one of the best barbeque sauces i ahve ever tasted!"}
{"text":"Bubba Q's you're now the second delicious restaurant that I've been to where I expect to leave overly stuffed but instead was pleasantly full and content.  Based on some of the other reviews I was nervous; cafeteria lighting (it was bright but not overbearing), ketchupy-sauce (it did have a bit of ketchup tang but the ribs were delish without it), too small portioned sides (I say they were just enough - in like medium sized ramekins), overpriced (this is Avon - what out there doesn't cost at least a decent amount?), not enough sauce (our ribs came with a side but I barely used any, I don't think you need it), fatty ribs (the boneless baby back - not at all, but the St. Louis style got a little weirdly fatty/cartiledgey at the end), no wet naps (we each got one at the end of the meal), slow waitresses (ours was super attentive, but we came in on a Thursday night), but none of this was a real problem during our visit.  We'll be back for more."}
{"text":"Came here on a recommendation from a work contact.  Place was surprisingly empty, maybe because I came during an off time. Ordered the brisket because that's my barbecue meat of choice. Sadly I was disappointed. There were a couple good pieces, but it was mostly dry and tough. The sides were okay, but at the hefty pricetag of $17 I was unimpressed"}
{"text":"We came on a Thursday evening we had the special with st louis, baby back.ribs and the brisket and pulled pork it was diner for 4 SO much food. Brought home plenty of left overs.  The kids loved the macaroni and cheese in fact we ordered another one after they finished the first!   We will be back!  The ribs we great  really liked the st Louis ribs the best.  However did not care for the beans.  Try them you won't be sorry"}
{"text":"We went out of our way to get here and arrived at 9:30 tonight. The post hours say that they close at 10:00 but they had already locked their doors and were no longer letting anyone in. So lame."}
{"text":"Just left Bubba's Q... All I can say is we won't be back. It's been a couple years since we were last there and it has gone down hill. The baked beans seemed like they were from a can and the babyback ribs were all fatty, if they were even babyback ribs. I think they were spareribs. I'll go to smokey bones for now on..."}
{"text":"Very good ribs. Get the ribs on bone with Mac and cheese and green beans. Get in early or you will end up waiting."}
{"text":"I am hooked on Bubbas. I was surprised at the amount of people waiting for a table. IT WAS WORTH THE WAIT!  Delicious tender Smokey meats. The staff is friendly too."}
{"text":"Only BBQ joint close to home on the West side. Food wasn't bad by any means but they have areas that they can improve.   More of a home-style feel dining area with not a ton of seating. Good variety of BBQ.  They have their signature boneless ribs that was featured on Shark Tank. Pulled pork was juicy but I was disappointed that they only have one BBQ sauce.   Kettle chips that they serve are dusted with seasoning which is fantastic. Service was poor considering there was not a lot of people dining for lunch. Pricing is very reasonable. Bubbas is good but there's nothing extremely special that makes me want to come back in a real hurry."}
{"text":"Food was delicious! Got the boneless ribs and they tasted top notch. The staff was very friendly and the restaurant was clean. My only ripe was the temp of the restaurant. It was cold enough to require a coat and made the food cool off in a hurry.  Pros: great food and staff Cons: room temp was uncomfortably cold"}
{"text":"Went in for an early dinner: quick version-not worth it.    Long version: Service was good, waitress was friendly and attentive.  The restaurant itself is kinda run down, tables are old and kinda sticky.   Ambiance: Seems like mostly older couples though could just be the time of day. There are some midsized TVs mounted on the walls playing nationally televised games, not exactly your sports bar quality but good enough for local games.  Food-Ordered baby back ribs, mac and cheese, and coleslaw with a side of sweet potato fries.  Ribs were super dry and overlooked...kinda like eating jerky to be honest. I'm not sure if it was leftover from lunchtime that had been forgotten on the grill or what but it was nearly inedible. Cardinal sin terms of BBQ joints. BBQ sauce was a tad sweet for my taste but not bad.  Mac and cheese was oily and not that cheesy. Coleslaw was a bit bland, pretty sure it was a store bought mix.  Sweet potato fries were undercooked and under seasoned.   Value: 40bucks for a main dish, fries and 2 drinks...not too expensive but it's not a particularly great deal.    Really wanted to like this local joint but unfortunately I'd have to say pass."}
{"text":"AWFUL is all I can say.  Got there at 5:20Pm on Saturday and didn't get our food until after 6:30pm.  My beer came with a dead bug in it, and the beer was not even comped.   The corn bread was from A week ago and could have been used as a door stop.  Not sure what all the hype is about with Bubba Q's, I've had better BBQ at those fast food places in the South."}
{"text":"Disappointing! Family of 5, very looong wait to get our food, sides were very small and bland, but the ribs and pulled pork had a good flavor. Our waitress was very sweet and nice, but we had to ask for refills and service. I saw a lot of people \"working\" and even heard the F bomb at one point come from the kitchen. Having 3 small children I did not like to hear such talk. I think I understand why they had a very small crowd. I even explained to the cashier my dissatisfaction and I would not be back, only to be told, \"sorry\", and I paid my $80+. Not that I am looking for a free meal but I don't see this establishment being open much longer if their service and food quality does not improve."}
{"text":"Best BBQ you will find around here (not counting the annual Cleveland Rib Cook Off).  Bubba is a cheap bastard and refuses to dish out hot BBQ sauce on request.  That costs him some points here.  As any Cleveland transplant knows you can't expect much for good food in blue collar/unemployment American car drivin' wonderland.  But Bubba delivers.  Browns suck.  Go Seahawks!"}
{"text":"I went to Sunday dinner with my bff's family for her birthday. I recognize we were a group of 11 but given that the meat was already cooked, the service was ridiculously slow. Additionally, one person ordered a baked potato with butter and cheese but it came out with cheese and MAYO! Gross, right? So when they replaced it, the potato was lacking the cheese. The corn and mac and cheese are both tasty. The meat we all had was good but much more sauce was needed for everyone. I doubt I will return..."}
{"text":"I would not think twice about going back to Bubba's Q. My family and I went on a Saturday night at peak hours and had no problem getting a table. We were greeted by a friendly staff and approached by our waiter immediately. Our waiter was very knowledgeable of the menu and made several great recommendations, not to mention that it was the BEST bbq I have ever had. I had ordered the half rack special of their de-boned ribs- which is more than enough for one person and reasonably priced at $18 with two sides. Unheard of deal for the quality and taste of such a great meal. The macaroni and cheese and baked beans were my favorite sides since me and my husband shared the majority of our meals. He ordered the smoked chicken and it was equally delicious. Even my son's chicken tenders and fries looked tasty.   People complain about the prices but its no more expensive than applebees. Most of the meats come in two options either half/full portion but with entrees ranging from $8 to $30 you are bound to find something yummy AND in your price range.    The service was outstanding. Big Al came to our table twice to see how our meal was and his kids and wife asked us as well how were were doing. The level of interest in our satisfaction was a main priority from both the owners and the wait staff. I would go back in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend was born and raised in Atlanta.  Even though he has moved around since graduating from UGA, he is a Southern boy at heart.  But when we were discussing where to go to dinner last night, I couldn't help but laugh when he asked me if there was someplace in Cleveland that served good ol' Southern home-style cooking.  My response of \"The Cracker BarreI?\" was not acceptable to him, so he looked to Yelp for a little help.  By the time I got out of the shower he had decided on Bubba's.  They had fried chicken, collard greens and mac and cheese...that would be enough to quench his southern cravings. We started out with the potato skins topped with pulled pork.  The serving was huge and the pulled pork was amazing.  We had to stop ourselves from eating them or we would be too full for dinner! I ordered their special \"d-boned\" ribs.  The 1/2 slab was $17.99 which I did not think was bad, but they charge extra for everything.  A baked potato is considered a \"super\" side and cost me an extra $.99 and then an additional $.50 for a side of sour cream!  I thought this was ridiculous.  If I wanted a salad for a side, it would have been an additional $1.99!  So when all is said and done, my $17.99 1/2 slab dinner turned into a $21.50 dinner.  This is not cool Bubba's.  My boyfriend ordered the whole fried chicken for $14.99.  His sides of collard greens and mac and cheese were considered \"normal\" sides, so no up charges for him. I forgot about the prices when they brought out the food.  My ribs were awesome.   Tender and cooked just right.  My boyfriends chicken looked and smelled amazing!  He started with a leg and mentioned how moist and juicy the chicken was.  I am weird about my chicken.  I am one of the very few people that would rather have my chicken on the dry side.  It may be because I've gotten salmonella from undercooked chicken one to many times.  But he seemed happy with it, so I didn't say anything.  That is until he cut into a thigh piece and blood ran out.  Beneath the breading and skin, the chicken was almost raw.  My stomach immediately turned and I looked to flag down the waitress.  My boyfriend stopped me, he would just try another piece.  He is just too nice.  Whatever.  So he moved onto a breast.  I was watching him eat now.  I didn't trust the chicken and the last thing I wanted to do was play nurse to my food poisoned boyfriend later on that night.  He pulled off the first layer of breast meat and he thought it looked fine.  I did not.  It was completely raw underneath.  Disgustingly raw.  This was the last straw for him.  We asked for our server and showed her the raw disgusting pieces.  She apologized and took the plate to show her manager.  She came back a few minutes later and asked if we wanted another batch of chicken, something else from the menu, or the dinner taken off of our bill.  My boyfriend had lost his appetite by now, so we just asked for the meal to be removed from the bill.  Our server came back about 5 minutes later and gave us our bill, with the chicken taken off, and a $25 gift card so we would come back and give Bubba's another try.  I thought that was a very nice gesture.  Most restaurants these days seem to take on a huge attitude when you have a problem with the meal.  Almost like it is your fault that they messed up.  I've found it hard at times to even get a manager to acknowledge that there is a problem.  So even though we were served undercooked chicken, Bubba's acknowledged the mistake and made it right with us.  I can't bring myself to give it two stars due to the chicken issue, but we will definitely go back and give it another shot at a better review.  We just won't order the chicken."}
{"text":"Went to Bubba's for Sunday afternoon lunch. We were sat right away but 15 minutes later had to ask the hostess clearing tables for a server. After taking our drink order it took another 10 mins to get them out and to order our food. From that time until 40 minutes later when our food came out server was MIA. He never came back to even refill our drinks. And one person was waiting on chili and they didn't realize they were out of chili until the rest of our food came out. The food was average at best and the service terrible. Not worth the time it takes and lack of attention to customers. The young girl there that looked to be about 6 or 7 was working harder than any other person there."}
{"text":"Well this is an average at best BBQ but it does the trick of getting your BBQ fix in.  I think the best part is the sauce....and then they skimp you on it. HERES MY RECAP: REVISION:  I went back again and they have THE BEST CHICKEN WINGS I have ever eaten.  I have had more than a few in my day and lemme telly ya THESE ARE THE BEST!  I just changed my rating from three to four stars.   1. Great sauce-Not enough of it. 2. Service-SLOOOOOW but friendly 3. Price-PRETTY EXPENSIVE FOR WHAT YA GET 4. Location-off the beaten path but plenty of parking 5. RIBS- Kinda fatty and stewed.  Im more of a fan with tug to the meat instead of falling off of the bone. THE SKINNY- Go to Hot Sauce Williams instead.  Heck I hate commercial restaurants but I would rather go to Daves in North Olmsted."}
{"text":"Went there on thursday night for dinner  Arrived about 5:45 dith party of 4.  Only 2 other tables had guests and dining room was very cool  Everyone rubbing there hands and wearing their coats.  Only 2 waiters for the dining room and service rather slow.  Food came out of the kitchen at a snails pace.    Food was very good.  The ribs were the meatiest I've ever had.  The pulled pork was also verygood.  By the time we left, an hour and 1/2 later the place was full, but service stillno better.   Still best ribs I have had."}
{"text":"Service, service, service.  Had to wait to be seen by the hostess, then wait to be seated, then waited to be greeted by our waitress at the table, waited 15 mins on our drinks and another 15 mins to order our food.   ZERO stars for service.  Food was great once it arrived and then again no waitress to refill our drinks or asked if the dinners were as we ordered.  Four stars for food quality.  Net TWO Stars.  Definitely will do takeout next time.  This place could be a real gem if the service was better..."}
{"text":"I think I went on the wrong night.. -86' multiple items, brisket and their famed boneless ribs being a couple of the items. -Understaffed, one server on for the whole restaurant due to management being at a news outing. Excuses being made all over the place to multiple guests, guests don't care, fix the issue. -7 minute greet at the front door, seated and the server never came back after the announcement of the 86'd items.  -Took my order and only half of it came out, finished my entree and reminded the server of the other dish and she went to go get it. The dish was so over cooked it was not edible. The server even commented that she knew it was over cooked.  -Server was overwhelmed and dropped the burnt ends all over the floor as I was paying out.   I was really wanting BBQ. The restaurant was left to fend for themselves. There was no supervision, no one available and loud angry music was coming from the kitchen.  Wanted to put more stars but despite buying my appetizer and knowing it was forgotten, it's was knowingly sent out burnt. I waved goodbye to the burnt ends that were still on the floor as I left."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love authentic BBQ?  I have never left this place as anything less than satisfied.  The sauce has gotten it's praises sung by many many people before, so I'm not going to cover that because they are all correct.  The real stars in my eyes, or should that be stomach, are the brisket and the fried chicken.  Neither of which, in my opinion require a drop of sauce.  There's just something about that fried chicken that makes my mouth water even while writing this review.  Moist and juicy, but with a nice crunchy breading.  When it first showed up on the menu, Al \"Bubba\" Baker himself explained to me that it is in fact his \"momma's\" own recipe.  He added that it was one of the reasons he got so big.  Sold.  Let me just put it this way.  The first bite I took I had all of these wonderful flavors swimming around my mouth, and dripping down my chin.  The beef brisket was tender, juicy, and had a wonderful smokey flavor that didn't over power the meat taste.  It was also perfectly complimented by the collard greens I had ordered as my side.  And then there's the corn bread.  WOW!  You can tell that this corn bread has been perfected through years and years of practice.  Not dry, great flavor, and just enough corn kernels mixed in.  You can tell it's all made from scratch.  If you're going for your first time I suggest you order \"The Lineman\" which is a HUGE sampler platter with ribs, pulled pork, beef brisket, and a few sides.  There's enough food for 3 or 4 people to eat, and it's a great primer to the flavors offered at Bubba Q's.  All in all, it's the type of BBQ that you wish you could make yourself at home."}
{"text":"This was my first and, unfortunately, last time eating from Bubba's Q.  My wife and I ordered the smoked chicken and pulled pork with corn bread and baked beans as sides.  All were disappointing.  The food was luke warm, lacked flavor was expensive.  For the two of us to eat, it was over $50.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"I've been to Bubba's about 5 times now and I feel like an idiot for going back the 4 other times.  However, very few places that you can get BBQ on the Westside of Cleveland.  Lets face it, its not our thing!      The servers are rude, slow, and screw up your orders.  The main problem with this place is, its EXTREMLY OVERPRICED and skimp on the sides dishes.  I asked for Mac n Cheese on the side, but they forgot to but in on my plate.  So instead, she comes back with literally a Condiment sized serving, barely a half a cup.   This is complelty unacceptable for a BBQ Place, your supposed to overload the sides and sauce, thats how a real BBQ place does it.  Also, the ribs are decent at best, nothing special.  I have feeling Bubba is taking naive Westsiders for a ride.    I'd skip this place if your looking for BBQ, its not worth the price, you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"The place was not at all crowded. Maybe 9 people when our party of six arrived for lunch. Saw only one waiter. Working his butt off, but did not appear very effective. The food was slow, but ok. I got a side salad and bowl of chili. OK, but no better than Wendy's. Ordered extra dressing for salad (ranch), they were out got blue cheese, but no extra . Someone asked for ketchup twice. Only had 3 fries left when it arrived. Would any of us ever go back? No,no,no."}
{"text":"Oh Michael Symon, you let me down!  I got there right at 11:30am when they opened on a Wednesday.  In Michael's defense, I did not get the boneless ribs.  I opted for the brisket dinner. BRISKET - Not good.  I could tell it was a few days old and reheated.  There was a river of grease under my sides in my to go box.  Not sauce, grease.  The girl behimd the counter ( very nice girl) told me it was sliced into thick slivers but mine was more like shredded.  I don't like shredded meat. I could only eat a little bit of it.  No amount of sauce could hide that. MAC AND CHEESE- Not good.  It definitely wasn't made in house.  It was watery and not even warm.  Still ate it.  I was hungry and spent $20 on this shit! COLESLAW - not very good.  The cabbage was definitely from a bag and it was a couple days old based on the wilted and browning cabbage.  The flavor was good though."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, but they were out of some key menu items - fries,  coleslaw,  chicken. Server was great and the place has a fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"BBQ was on point. Probably best I have had in NE Ohio. Ordered sampler for 4. Great sauce and meat was super tender. Server did a great job. Will be going back."}
{"text":"Oh sweet sweet BBQ... I had heard Bubba Q's talked up since I moved to CLE, and after a too tempting to resist Groupon, it was time to check it out.   I need to preface this with I have a favorite BBQ place already, but it's in CA, so I'm not comparing, but I am.   I ordered the sampler platter, and a bunch of extra sides. (I admit I'm a sides whore). My favorite thing was the brisket, which kind of surprised me, because I usually hate brisket, too fatty. But this was perfectly lean and thinly sliced. The mac and cheese, green beans and creamed corn (which they call fried corn, huh?) were also tops in my book.   Downside: there was practically no sauce on anything and they only gave a little cup of it, took awhile to get an extra serving. And it tasted very strongly of ketchup. Not impressed.  My ribs were VERY fatty, if you like that kind of thing great , me not so much. And the service was very slow. Oh, and the chili tasted like salty wet cat food, and yes, I've tried cat food before. They didn't have wet naps on the table or at the end of the meal either, which seemed strange.   Tip: sit on the back patio! It has a cool fire place and even freezing outside on Friday night, we were toasty and didn't have to wait for a table. The outside patio looks nice too, might try it again next summer..."}
{"text":"It seems people have mixed opinions about Bubba's Q.  I personally had no problems/complaints with my dining experience.  The staff was friendly and attentive (we admittedly were first timers) and helpful with our menu selections.  I went for the deboned rib steak with slaw and sweet potato fries.  Sweet potato fries are always a must when I see them on a menu and I liked the slaw as a cooling off factor with the bbq sauce.  It might have been a tad pricey, but I wouldn't hesitate to go there again when I'm nearby."}
{"text":"I live in Los Angeles and I ordered some of Bubba's ribs. Let me just say, awesome, awesome. As we say in St Louis;\"they will make you slap your mama.\"  I don't generally eat pork, except some Honey Bake Ham during Xmas. But..when I saw their story on Shark Tank, I had to try these succulent bones lees ribs. I ordered some of their cheesecake cones and can't wait to taste them. Yummy'  I'm so very proud of this family and this is a testament of when you don't give up on your dreams of what God can do. His family has been perfecting this product for 30 years and look at God. The scripture below is proof that no matter how long your dream take to come to fruition. God will give you way more than you think you lost.  \"Your latter house shall be greater than the former saint the Lord of host and in this place I will give you peace.\" Haggai 2:9  God bless you Bubba family!"}
{"text":"The restaurant needs updating.Very dingy inside. There was only one other table of people there when we came in on a Friday evening. We ordered the boneless ribs with beans and coleslaw and the BBQ chicken with coleslaw and side salad. Side salad a waste of money. Just chopped up lettuce. The sides were teeny tiny tiny. Beans are not expensive, they really should triple the size! Muffin was sweet and more cakelike than cornbread. Wine was below par. My husband said the ribs were dry but liked the sauce. I liked the chicken and it was a good size portion. Waitress was unfriendly and did not smile once. We were over the top friendly to her and left a good tip hoping it might cheer her up for the next patrons coming in. I was very disappointed and expected more with this place."}
{"text":"I visit from Florida and I know the coleslaw is awesome but the expensive brisket when we dined in was a small portion and disappointing. We all 3 ordered the brisket and the quantity for the price was not adequate. The flavor was fair, a bit fatty not very tender. Overall disappointed. Probably not go back for brisket only the coleslaw."}
{"text":"This place looks like a shack ........ With that being said shacks are the best place for the best bbq !!!!! We were on our way home from Toledo so we decided to stop. We have heard so much about this bbq joint. It was highly recommended by multiple friends !  We had four people with us : two of us ordered  the boneless ribs that were on the show shark tank and the other two ordered the bbq chicken.  What I like about this place is they only have one bbq sauce which is so delicious and I don't have to choose and try a bunch of sauces to see which one I want with my dinner.  This place is a must try for all bbq lovers. So worth the drive wherever you come from."}
{"text":"Smelled like MILDEW and Musty. Was filthy dirty. Tables were not clean. Menu had sauce on it. Windows were filthy. Everything was dirty. WE WALKED OUT.. I usually dont write reveiws..I cannot and will not eat at a place that almost make me gag from the mildew smell walking in there."}
{"text":"Went to dinner on a Friday night at 6:30pm and no one was here.  Should have been the first sign to eat else where.  Ordered grilled chicken.  The waitress came to the table stating they didn't have any chicken that it was frozen. Asked if they had any fried chicken   The waitress said they were out of fried chicken.  It's Friday at 6:30pm.  Really.  Al Baker shut the doors now.  The boneless ribs were cold  had to send them back and over priced for the quality of meat (poor) and the sides were served In plastic cups and small. I don't know what is worse the food here or the Cleveland Browns.  Will not go back.  People listen to the reviews. Save your money."}
{"text":"Dropped by for dinner last night. Close to the Cleveland Clinic Avon, so it's a convenient place for wonderful food. I had the boneless rib dinner...perfection. My son had the rib sandwich and loved it. The fresh chips and slaw were a perfect addition. It was my son's first visit and it won't be the last. The server was very friendly and helpful, just what we needed! For a Thursday night, it was busy and everyone seemed to be having good time. Its also good for carryout. I've ordered ahead and picked it up, all packaged very well for the trip home. Thanks Bubba!"}
{"text":"Bubbas-Q is very much a place that should be on diners, drive-ins and dives.   Normally a 2.5 star type place. But the boneless ribs are 5 star. The smoke and dry rub give them so much flavor. Very tender!!!  I had mac & cheese for a side.   The food was outstanding.  Service so-so. And atmosphere reminds me of the south."}
{"text":"Drove nearly an hour from the east side to try this place in sub-zero temps and in a blizzard. On our way there, I just kept thinking to myself \"this better be worth it!\" Was a bit surprised when we pulled up as the restaurant was a bit oddly located, I thought. Not sure how to explain it, but it seemed like it's attached to a warehouse of some sort and next to a railroad. Inside, the set up of the dining room was not typical of a restaurant and the decor was very plain. Nevertheless, we're there for the food, so we ended up ordering the MVP family meal to share. It includes baby back ribs, smoked chicken, pulled pork, brisket, beans, coleslaw, fries, cornbread... and we also upgraded the ribs to their deboned ribs... wow!! After that drive, it was worth it. Surprisingly, it was a ton of food and we ended up taking a lot of it home. Service was very casual. It did take a while, but Bubba himself came by to ask how dinner was. I think I took some pictures. I'll post when I find them. But... despite the long drive, lacking ambiance and okay service, the food was great!"}
{"text":"boneless ribs  boneless ribs  ribs without bones  boneless ribs  boneless ribs  boneless ribs"}
{"text":"I wish I could have given 0 stars. I was absolutely embarrassed that I sent my family to get takeout from Bubba's. We ordered the MVP - both slabs of ribs were inedible, one because they were too thin and the far end of the slab and the other because it was overcooked to the point of being impossibly to pull off the bone. The pulled pork emitted a terribly foul smell that had no smokiness and actually smelled spoiled. The brisket was terrible as well - just beef, no smoke. There was a little bit of sauce in each container probably to hide the fact that there was no flavor and bad smells. The half cooked chicken was okay but tasted funny as well. Finally, the chicken fingers we ordered were overcooked and came with 2 normal size pieces and two halves.   I would avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"Had dinner at bubbas on a Tuesday at 615. Not busy but then again it is a weekday. The food was phenomenal. We got the MVP which is a little bit of everything: St. Louis ribs, baby back ribs, BBQ chicken, beef brisket, corn muffins, pulled pork, beans, cole slaw, and fries. St. Louis ribs were my favorite. The corn muffins were delicious. Everything was delicious. The restaurant is laid back and has a lot of memorabilia. Bubba wasn't here but I was definitely satisfied with my visit. I definitely plan on coming back."}
{"text":"While the food here is decent for Ohio BBQ, you have to wait forever for your food and the service from the wait staff is really bad.  This is my second time eating here and I have no plans to go back.  We got there before 3pm on a Saturday so it was not crowded.  We were seated and had our orders taken within a reasonable amount of time but then we just waited.  And waited. And waited.  Finally after a good half hour our waiter told us it would be about 4 more minutes, it was 10+.  In the meantime, we were never served rolls or cornbread or anything else to accommodate the wait time.  And I'm pregnant so I was starving.  The waiter never check in on us again and we had to request refills.  If you're interested in trying their food, order it ahead of time for carry out - don't waste you're time eating at the restaurant.  The food is also a bit overpriced for just average BBQ.  In my opinion, you're better off eating at one of the BBQ chains."}
{"text":"Simply love this place. Been there only 2 times but both times were great. Second time I got the groupon where it offered dinner for 4. Still way too much food. It all tasted great and our waitress was wonderful. I will be back."}
{"text":"Our family of three ate here last night and were we disappointed!  It's been about 2 years since we ate here last (we used to love it!).  Things have really changed since then!  My husband had a full slab of ribs that he had to cut apart with a BUTTER KNIFE because he was not given a steak knife.  His sweet potato fries and my daughter's regular fries were room temperature at best!  I ordered the pulled pork dinner and it was BARELY warm!  Our corn muffins were cold and no butter was served with them. And my husband was not given any wet naps or a basket for his rib bones!  I would think that a place that sells alot of Ribs and other messy BBQ type foods would automatically give you at least some wet naps!   All-in-all, we were disappointed, especially for the price! And the restaurant was not even busy!  Maybe only 4 other tables of people when we were there!"}
{"text":"So, despite the many shortcomings, we keep going back to Bubba's Q, and tonight was again not the smoothest experience.   We really like the de-boned rib sandwich, and it was a good as always. Their lack of diversity in side dishes is really an issue for a barbecue restaurant, in my opinion.  The biggest issue tonight was their \"Kids Eat Free on Tuesday\" policy... because the adults ordered sandwiches and not platters, we had to pay for our kids' meal. My issue isn't paying for the meal -- it's the cheapness around a policy like that. I feel it does more to sour customers than anything else. I really don't think there should be a huge KIDS EAT FREE ON TUESDAY sign if the particulars are so specific; it's not as if we tried to get a free meal without ordering anything else.  Service was \"meh\" as usual. It started with the patio being closed early and ended with us waiting, waiting, and waiting for our check when we were the only customers in the restaurant.  I always leave thinking, \"Such potential.\""}
{"text":"It seems to depend on what day you go here for how the experience is. The first time we ate here, my husband and I were joined by my parents. We shared the MVP meal that we'd purchased a Groupon for. The service was great and the food was delicious and there was a lot of it. We visited again when my in-laws were visiting and it was a complete 180. My husband and I split the 1/2 MVP meal which my in-laws each ordered different meals. The service was very slow and some time after we placed our order our server returned and asked my husband and I if we could choose a different side since they were out of one of the sides we ordered. She addressed this question only to my husband and I even though my father-in-law had ordered the same side. We assumed his was the last portion they had. The server didn't come back, so my husband went to the counter to double check since his father is celiac and the side we'd chosen to replace our side was mac and cheese, which he can't have. It was a good thing we checked because she was planning on replacing his side as well with the mac and cheese even though she never asked what he'd prefer. When our food arrived, the cornbread was burnt and we realized part way through the meal that we hadn't received our chips. Also, even though it was the 1/2 MVP it wasn't even close to half of what we received our first visit. It was maybe 1/3, and that's being generous. When we flagged down our server, who had not checked on us since we received our food even though two of us had empty drinks by this point, she first told us that our order didn't come with chips even though when we'd placed the order she asked if we wanted them plain or spiced. When we came back with our drinks she said she was wrong, that we were supposed to have chips and actually asked if we wanted them or not. Why would we have brought it up if we didn't want them? Although by the time we actually received them we were almost finished. The time we flagged her over and when she came to give us our check were the only times we were checked on even though by the time we got our food it wasn't very busy. We know she wasn't new because we'd seen her there on our first visit months before. I don't know what happened between our first and second visit, but we were very impressed our first time and extremely disappointed our second. I don't know if we'll be back again or not. Although we have to say, the boneless ribs were delicious."}
{"text":"This is probably the 6th or 7th time I tried Bubba's. When we arrived it was obvious the air conditioning was not working. We decided to stay and were told that there would be a 10 minute wait \"or until one of the tables opened up.  We were seated in about 20 minutes.   I ordered the boneless ribs. Half slab. There is no way that I could ever finish a full slab. This is the second time I've had them and they are fantastic. And I don't like ribs. The only way this place falls short for me is the sides. The beans seem to be direct from a can and the mac and cheese seems close to Kraft brand. My friend ordered pulled pork and it came floating in a half inch of pork \" juice\". My guess is they just had it in a pot on the stove. Warmed it up and never drained it well. He took three bites and sent it back.   They have stopped bringing rolls and muffins in a basket. You now get a single corn bread muffin. No butter by the way.   With the exception of the boneless ribs this place seems to be slipping. It's just not what it used to be. Come on Bubba. Get back in the kitchen and get it back up to par.   Service wasn't bad. The a/c seemed to start after we were there for a bit. I felt very bad for the older female hostess that was obviously overheated. I was worried she would pass out.  On a side note. I don't want to go here with this but I will because I think it needs said. The young African-American male waiting on the table next to us brought out a basket of cornbread and refilled it at least once. He also said I'm giving you some more fries and brought out a basket. I think they may have been related to him."}
{"text":"While the variety and large portions at Bubba's Q are appealing, the actual taste of the barbecue is only average at its best.  The worst offender was the brisket, which lacked the moistness that should naturally come without resorting to slathering the meat in sauce.  The ribs were a little better, with the dry rub on both the St. Louis and Baby Back styles really coming through, but the rib itself, while fairly meaty, was slightly on the tough side.  Service was friendly, though a little lack of cleanliness (spilled food on the floor, hastily cleared tables not properly wiped down) tainted the general environment.  A distinct bleach smell lingered in the dining room for much of our meal, which didn't exactly whet our appetites.  Going to Bubba's Q, and seeing the various \"Best in Cleveland\" awards (which is simultaneously surprising and sad for the area), you want to believe it's a homestyle barbecue gem tucked away in Avon, Ohio, but I'd put it just on par with the apparent Northeast Ohio barbecue mecca of Great Northern Mall where Famous Dave's and Smokey Bones are located."}
{"text":"BBQ was good, service was good no complaints. Moms fried chicken was  very good.  Slaw was good mac and cheese was not my favorite. I would go back, but would not make this a regular stop."}
{"text":"Food was excellent! Service was horrible, server never came back to our table to ask how our food was or ask us if we needed a refill on our drinks!"}
{"text":"Great food but don't do the carry out. We had carry out five times and each time we had to wait forever  to pick up the food.  When we got home the orders were wrong( all five times). Thanks Bubba."}
{"text":"I am so sad right now. I just had a really disappointing BBQ experience. :(  Let's start with the good so I can ease you into the bad. Service at the carry-out counter is excellent. The pleasant young lady who helped me was honest and knowledgeable about the menu. Even the old man who came in to pick up his food was sweet and friendly when telling me about what to get. Also, If you sign up for their phone alerts you get 10% off your purchase.   I went with the sampler platter which has ribs, brisket, pulled pork and two sides for $16.99. I opted for coleslaw, green beans, and added mac & cheese. The young lady who helped me tossed in some cornbread to try since it was my first time there. Fries were included by mistake.   The sides come in 4oz containers, a little small, but no need to be glutenous. The green beans were nice and reminded me of something my grandma would make. The coleslaw was of the creamy kind and nice as well. The mac & cheese tasted like the melted butter you get with crab legs. It was a weird taste that I am still not sure if I liked or not. The little cornbread muffins were a let down because they were more dry muffin than cornbread. For the fries, I don't know if it was the processed frozen fry itself or the oil it was cooked in, but they did not taste good and I threw them away. None of the meat was juicy, tender, fall off the bone, or melt in your mouth. It was all dry, overcooked, and flavorless. The homemade BBQ sauce was good though and helped things a lot, but I still did not finish the meat nor kept it for leftovers.   I don't know what happened here. When you walk in there are all of these plaques on the wall - awards and articles about how great the food is. The owner was even on Shark Tank for his deboning rib method. Maybe I just came in on an off day, maybe years ago the food was phenomenal, but it unfortunately is no longer. I would not go back and I would not recommend."}
{"text":"I got the signature rib steak to go with a side of the beans and macaroni. I thought the ribs were very good and the sides were okay. The take out service wasn't very friendly and I think the price is a bit steep, but I would order it again."}
{"text":"Had dinner here on a Saturday night.  Arrived between 5:30-6:00, and the place was getting busy.  There was a line stretching outside, and I'm guessing the wait time for an inside table was around 20-30 minutes.  We decided to take an outdoor table, and although it was a touch warm, it was the perfect environment for a BBQ feast.  Draft beer selection is pretty minimal, but the waitress said they had a larger selection of bottled beers.  Apps - got a couple orders of wings and some burnt ends for our large party.  The wings were large and quite tasty, and basically the wing version of their fried chicken dinner (more about that later).  The burnt ends were good, but they came covered in their BBQ sauce, and the flavor overpowered the meat.  Would prefer to have the sauce just on the side...will remember that for next time.  Dinner - the four adults in our party each ordered something different so we could share.  The brisket was tender, and I imagine their sandwiches are killer.  The pulled pork was pretty good, but the portion size (compared to the other meals) was on the smaller side.  Again, bet it would make a great sandwich.  I had the full rack of baby rack ribs, and they were solid.  Meat fell off of the bone, and it was clear these babies were smoked on premises...hell, we sat next to the smokers!  Maybe just a touch on the dry side, though.  My wife ordered the whole friend chicken.  It came out on two plates!  It could literally feed an entire family easily.  The batter is light and on the mild side, and the chicken was very meaty.  However, and this is common with large pieces of fried meat, it was on the dry side because they had to cook it for so long.  That said, it was an impressive meal.  My only other nitpick is that the portion of the side dishes I ordered were very small.  While the mac & cheese and southern-style green beans were very good, they were gone in a couple of bites.  Oh well.  The reason that this isn't a five-star review is because of the service.  Our server was very friendly, and handled our large party (4 adults, 5 kids) very well, but she completely forgot our second round of drinks (draft beer and a glass of wine).  Normally, this wouldn't be a problem, but since the place was busy, it took about 30 minutes for our food to leave the kitchen.  We didn't see her for about 20 minutes after placing the order, so I went inside and had another server take care of it for me.  Only flaw in what was otherwise and highly enjoyable meal.  We will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Tried this once and never been back, super small portions not typical with bbq places. The BBQ itself isn't all that special, sauce is okay, but the meat and seasoning are nothing to write home about. Wouldn't recommend this place if you are use to great BBQ."}
{"text":"We are local and frequent Bubba's often. The service is usually horrible. The food is always good although his side dishes leave something to be desired. But tonight they had all new servers. And they were good!  Maybe he finally gave his family the boot for good service. I am for employing my family but not to the detriment of my company.  Will see what the next visit brings!"}
{"text":"We had the MVP special which is a little bit of everything the ribs were good and tender service was good. no complaints will come back again"}
{"text":"Love this place. Pulling up outside and the smell is fabulous. The owners are great. It's also nice to see the owners kids working there!! The servers are fantastic!! Tuesday nights kids eat free!!"}
{"text":"I really really really wanted to like this place.  I've been driving by it for years and with a Groupon decided it was finally time to try it.  I was so disappointed.  The restaurant just felt \"dirty\".  Storage room door wide open for all to see employees purses, coats, etc - looked like a storage closet and did not help the atmosphere-nor did the 3 stacks of kiddie seats - just felt dirty.  We were seated by a window and had to move - felt like we were sitting outside the breeze was so bad.  Ribs were ok, but sides were cold and I think it was pulled pork on the plate - did not look appetizing.  Chicken was burned but luckily my husband will eat anything.  Unfortunately I see no reason to go back - so many new places to eat and this one would be a bottom-of-the-list choice.  Too bad.  Bubba Baker seems like such a nice guy - However, we all know if the owner is not there it makes a difference."}
{"text":"My husband and I drove 3 hours to check this restaurant out after seeing it on Shark Tank. HUGE disappointment. Service was horrible. Food was cold & very small portions of the bland sides. My chicken was so dry I couldn't eat it. My husband got the ribs and said they were ok. Probably would have been really good if they weren't cold."}
{"text":"I love the ribs and the smoked chicken. They are a little pricey for the atmosphere. The service is only good when Bubba or his wife are there. When they are not, their younger servers and possibly his daughter (not 100% sure) are slow somewhat rude and do not seem like they want to be there. They are one of the few decent bbq places around so we come here."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time in forever for a family members birthday this week (August 30 2016). The boneless ribs are amazing and the people working were just the nicest I have seen in a while. We had a large group and they were more than accommodating. The manager/ owner thanked us for our business multiple times and even gave us some apps while we were waiting for our main course. We brought a cake and they brought us plates and utensils. I cannot wait to go back and I would strongly recommend the de boned ribs."}
{"text":"I ordered ribs and had them sent to my sister in Philadelphia. Although she appreciated the gesture both she and her sons said they were far from good. I believe you take chances when you deal with a company the first time. I was not really upset (although they were expensive) I chalked it up to live and learn --- HOWEVER SINCE THEN I HAVE RECEIVED CALLS ON MY CELL PHONE CONTINUALLY. Sometimes 6 or 7 times a day !!!!!! They  won't stop -------------They do not take no ----I do not want to order ribs -- or anything else. This has been going on for months !!!!!  --When I call the restaurant they tell me they can't help me -- I have reported them to Consumer Protection and   every other agency that I can think of. I do want to change me cell # as I have had it for 15 yrs.  PLEASE --please do not give these people your contact number --- you will never get rid of them !!!! Besides  \"\"\"THEIR RIBS SUCK\"\"\"\"\""}
{"text":"Takeout review: brisket bites four stars, the rest of food two stars, forgetting the coleslaw and chili toppings (and being out of takeout silverware) one star. The rib sandwich was small with one onion on it (that's it), the chili saucy with no toppings, the dollar extra to sub fries gave us about twelve French fries. I didn't go back to correct the order. Not worth it."}
{"text":"What happened?  Too much fame.  Now you don't care. The place is tired. Chairs and tables old and dirty. Table had old food pieces on it.  Food is overpriced and portions are small.  Ribs are not fresh .  Maybe he is making too much money from the sharks.  And you've been there for 10 years in the parking lot is still gravel and dirt and mud and ice"}
{"text":"Good BBQ, awesome comfortable dinning room. Collard greens really needed salt, had to pour it on every bite."}
{"text":"PROS: Amazing de-boned ribs!  Mac and cheese was good, fries were tasty, and the shredded chicken sliders were tender. CONS: Baked beans were awful!  The sauce was sticky sweet and had cinnamon in them.  Ick.  Service was a little slow.  Update:  Went again and had the grilled chicken sandwich and my husband tried the brisket sandwich.  Both were very good!  Portions were generous, and as before, the mac and cheese was to die for.  Service was a little slow again - had to track down the waitress for our ticket.    Overall, a positive experience both trips and we will be back.  :)"}
{"text":"I recently had the displeasure of getting take-out here a few weeks ago.  I was craving BBQ, and had heard about this place so I decided to give it a try.  I had ordered a pound of pulled pork and a pound of beef brisket.  As I said in my previous BBQ restaurant review, I believe these are the two key dishes for any good BBQ joint.  Bubba's Q did not hit the mark on either of these dishes.  According to their website, \"All of our meats ...slow smoked with Ohio-grown Apple wood.\"  I would have to see this for myself, as I did not taste any smoke flavor in the pork or brisket.  In addition, I did not see any smoke ring on the brisket.  As for the brisket, it was very tough, with little to no flavor.  It tasted like a brisket that was done in the oven without seasoning, and cooked fast.  The pulled pork was little better, but I have had better from a grocery store deli counter.  I cannot give a review on the service, since I had gotten my food to go."}
{"text":"Really please with the service and food quality. Meat very tender and delicious. Sauce leaves you licking your lips.   Got to believe the bad reviews are from people who love the prepared food at McDonalds."}
{"text":"Platter was somewhat slopped together. Pulled pork was best on Q42 platter. Friendly staff. Food came extremely quick which led me to question its origin and immediately prior location. Didn't seem like it came \"right off grill\". Coleslaw was not good. For CLE it may be ok- would not last 1 week in Texas."}
{"text":"We really enjoy Bubba's and get there a few times a year. We love the shared plate as we have many hungry boys to feed. Great BBQ and a cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant for lunch recently and were pleasantly surprised. Do not let the exterior fool you, the interior is nicely decorated in Cleveland sports memorabilia and colors and is very clean. The staff was cheerful and friendly as well. We split the MVP (the half meal at $34; pictured) and it was more than enough for 2. The famous boneless babyback ribs were delicious and the smoked chicken was one of the best tasting we have had."}
{"text":"Overrated!  Sorry Bubba.  The portions are way too small and the food is not that great.  Atmosphere, other than seeing Bubba's memorabilia is sub par."}
{"text":"environment:  sports like  price: average  Service: average  Food: pretty good  i came with my fiancee and her parents. her parents ordered a full slab of st louis  (24 bucks i think) to share. me and my fiancee got the Q42 which i think was around $32 bucks. we also ordered the dawg pound wings for $9.99. my fiancee really liked the wings. the fiancee's parents full slab was pretty big and good. they could not finish it between the 2. the Q42 was a good amount but honestly, my fiancee and i can eat a little bit more than that. the Q42 comes with brisket, pulled pork, leg and thigh of a chicken,  1/4 slab of st louis ribs and 1/4 slab of  baby back ribs. also comes with fries or mac n cheese, and beans. the mac n cheese and the beans weren't anything different from other places.   i would come here again, but i dont think it would be my top pick."}
{"text":"Grandma's fried chicken is the best southern fried chicken dinner I have ever had. Former Army guy that spent a lot of time in the south should know!"}
{"text":"Have talked about eating bbq here for a couple of years.   Homey dining room. Not large but roomy enough that the tables aren't crammed together. Memorabilia from Bubba's football career.   Good variety of bbq meats and southern sides. Beer, wine and mixed drink menu is larger than most places of this size.Game day specials.   Everything we ordered was fantastic. Tender smoked brisket bites,  boneless ribs, pulled pork on a baked potato, even the coleslaw was divine.   We will be back!"}
{"text":"the sides are not generous and in stupid tiny portion cups, the bake beans need vinegar they are too darn sweet with honey, usually great ribs but you have to ask for any extra sauce on the side,  out of many visits got cold-chewy reheats only once.  Should never be, should always be fresh.  Cut up the old-cold for sandwiches or something.  Also, need to put a visible sign at an intersection somewhere, easy to drive right by this place without seeing it."}
{"text":"I looked up BBQ because we were in the mood for some. We have been going Famous Dave's for quite some time but we wanted to find someplace new. I found Bubba's Q online and remembered seeing it on Shark Tank. I figured it must be pretty good. I was wrong. The place is smaller than I expected. The restrooms are only for one person at a time. I had to wait more than five minutes to get into the restroom. The person that came out was an employee of the restaurant and when I went in the place was a mess. I would think he would have made an effort to clean it. What else don't they bother to clean? As for the food we got the hickory smoked chicken and the fried chicken. The BBQ sauce they give you on the side is not good. It had a funny taste to it. I think it was alcohol. There is only one choice of sauce flavor. The  chicken didn't look as though it was completely cooked. The fried chicken was over cooked, very dark and tasted like salt and grease. I will never go back and I could never in good conscience recommend this place to anyone. I will say there were many people coming in for take out. One thing that I did notice was not one employee that I interacted with ever asked me how the food was? After dining there I know why."}
{"text":"We've eaten at Bubba's many times. It's decent. We go back all the time in hopes of having just a stellar meal.  But it's always so close.  I don't know what it is but when I've gone it just can't get over the hump.   I like the place. Like I said, been there many times. Sometimes the bbq, the meat is a bit too over cooked.  Easy enough to do.  Like the sauces.    Just wish I could give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"OVER-RATED!!  Service awful!! Food awful!! Experience awful!! BBQ brisket sandwich soggy-mostly fatty meat in small portions. Boneless rib sandwich on pretzel bun just ok-nothing special. Seasoned chips burned and tasteless. Food came out cold after taking forever in a slow restaurant mid-afternoon. Sauce VERY average. High price. Silverware dirty. Left hungry and unsatisfied. Never again for me."}
{"text":"We have dined at bubbas bbq a few times. The first time the food was excellent. After that, the few times we went there, the service was awful, the food was burnt. The silverware and dishes were dirty and had dried food on them.   We purchased a Groupon for the MVP meal that should serve 4. There was not enough food to serve 2 people. We were also told that there was one MVP meal for regular customers and a different one for Groupon customers. With the Groupon meal(even though you pay almost the same amount) you get a small green beans and small baked beans (which might fill a Dixie cup) and  half the amount of meat as you would with the regular MVP meal. If you  wanted any other sides, you had to purchase them a la cart for an extra charge.  We purchased what we wanted for sides and tried to enjoy our meal.  As we were leaving, my niece wanted some chips to take home so we purchased a large order to go. A large order is approximately 15 chips, most of which were broken.   Needless to say, that was our last trip to bubba's bbq. Save your money and go some place else for dinner."}
{"text":"Went at 9pm on a Saturday and was seated quickly. Drink orders and orders taken right away. Got deboned rib steak sandwich, sweet potato fries and coleslaw. Food was good. Sandwich a little small for price. Need to update decor. Table and silverware clean...I mention this because I read somewhere this was not the case. Would go again."}
{"text":"We are big fans of Bubba's Q! My husband wanted to try it out since Bubba is a retired Cleveland Browns football player & this restaurant has won the \"Best Ribs\" award many years running. From the outside, it looks like a converted convenient store. But don't let that stop you from going in! The interior is cozy and full of sports memorabilia. We had a short wait the first time, so my family enjoyed looking at all the articles and jerseys.   On to the food review: The boneless ribs are awesome! Best side dish is definitely the mac & cheese. The desserts are all made fresh daily, and have always tasted great!   Separately, we had Bubba's cater a party for us at home. They were EXCELLENT! Nailed all the details, great service, and Bubba himself even made an appearance to work the grill for a bit. Our guests were delighted and they still talk about that experience now almost 8 years later.   I'll close with this fun fact: Bubba was once on the TV show Shark Tank! Google it if you are interested in watching."}
{"text":"Good but does not live up to the hipe.   When I go to a BBQ like this I expect to be blown away but the couple times I have gone, just haven't done it for me. Food is average, and portion sizes are on the small size. If I am picking the restaurant for lunch or dinner, I will not be picking Bubba's Q.   Not a bad place to go but keep you expectations in check."}
{"text":"This place is horrible . The only people that could possibly enjoy any thing serves here are people with very low standards for food and with no taste buds. I had ordered food from here over 2 years ago and I thought we would give it another chance. Big big mistake . I paid $10.00 for a brisket sandwich and  It literally  had 3 slices of meet on it. Arby's a block away has a bigger juicer sandwich . A chain restaurant. That's pretty sad . They answer the phone saying world famous.. World famous maybe for places never to eat at.  What a waste if belly space."}
{"text":"First let me say that we did not stay and eat here. (We were seated but that is a far as we got.)  It was around 3:00 on a Saturday afternoon and there were prob. 4 tables with people seated.  The service was horrendous .    We stood at the hostess station for a good 10 minutes before she even acknowledged us.  She seated us at a table and handed the menus to us and left.  After about 5 or 6 minutes later she came back and was our waitress.  I had purchased Livingsocial.com coupons and had them laying on the table top when she came back.  Without any warning she blurted out to me, \"YOU CAN'T USE THOSES!\" in the most rude tone I have heard from any wait staff in all my dining experience.  I looked up at her and she snatched them off the table and shoved it into my face shouting,  \"THESE ARE ONLY GOOD, TUESDAY THRU FRIDAY\".  I looked up and said, are you kidding me,  we just drove an hour and a half to get here and I can't use them?  She then shoved it at me again and said, \"LOOK, SEE HERE IT SAYS, 'VALID TUES THRU FRIDAY'.\"  \"Seriously\" was the only thing that came out of my mouth.  I was waiting for her to say, Let me talk to the manager or owner but she just stood there staring at us with disgust.  We got up and said that we would find somewhere else to eat and left.  I was shocked how terse and inflexible she was.  I would not recommend this establishment based on service alone, we never tried the food and never will."}
{"text":"While we travel around the country we always try to search out good BBQ places to try.  While searching the web we stumbled upon Bubba's BBQ in Avon.  The web site I found rated Bubba's #2 BBQ place in Cleveland. The #1 place was Famous Dave's, but we do our best to avoid chain restaurants.                The first thing I noticed when we pulled in was the large parking area out front with additional parking in the rear. The building was very clean and we were told to sit wherever we wanted.  It took a bit for a server to find us, but she was very friendly.      Initially I planned to order the brisket and ty a side of one of the pork products.  The waitress suggested that we order the boneless ribs (with the bones removed) with a side of brisket. That was a great choice.  We did not wait that long for the food to arrive.  Bubba's is known for their boneless ribs, I do not know how they remove the bones and keep the slab shape but they looked great, and they tasted even better. They were very tender and just the right amount of smoke.  I was not super impressed with the brisket it was kind of dry, but it had a good flavor.  My wife had the pulled pork and it was very tender moist and tasty. The coleslaw is a vinegar, onion and cabbage slaw with a real nice flavor. I ordered the full slab of ribs and it was too much food, we both took doggy boxes home for lunch the next day.      They have a really nice selection of beers to go along with the BBQ, Great Lakes Brewing was well represented with a couple of really tasty seasonal.     The waitress said that Michael Symon was there taping a segment for a show called Burgers, Brew & Q too be aired the summer of 2015, I will look forward to seeing that."}
{"text":"Oh Bubba.  I gained 5 pounds this weekend because of you.  I think I got 4 extra sides of sauce becuase everything tasted good dipped in it.  Fries dipped in sauce ... check, Sandwich dipped in sauce ... check, wife's ribs dipped in sauce ... check, salad dipped in suace ... no, but only because the sauce wasn't on the table yet.  Wife's baby back ribs were amazing.  Perfectly cooked and seasoned.  She got the deboned ribs which means we'll be back.  She loves ribs, but hates eating them off the bone.  Great food.  Bubba is friendly and was walking around the 'raunt."}
{"text":"Have been going here with my family for a long time. Each time, it feels like the service and food has gone down in quality.  Not only has the food gone down in quality, but the portions are far less. We really noticed this with the MVP meal, which is their big all in one bbq meal that feeds about 4 people and costs $55. Years ago, it came with a ton of food and now it's very noticeably less, for the same price.   If you're looking for good bbq food, I would definitely look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Probably some of the worse service/ BBQ I have had in a long time.   The service was mediocre both times I've been. I tend to give places second chances after the first mess up but this one really took the cake on visit 2.   I order their big potato w/ brisket (the first time I had sampler and brisket tasted amazing, everything else was dry) and my boyfriend got the brocket with green beans and sweet potatoes.   My boyfriends brisket was amazing as expected. The green beans came in the same \"cup\" as the BBQ sauce barely a serving for the $16 he paid for the meal. The sweet potatoes had no sweetness or flavor.  My potato had not bee cooked, I could not even put a fork in it. I had to remove the minuscule amount of meat and cheese from the top and put the potato in my oven.   It took maybe 15 minutes to wait on our food, we ordered carryout. I would've preferred waiting longer for fully cooked food. Smh the staff was friendly on my first visit this last time the were barely courteous.   I would not go back nor recommend anyone else go. I would rather drive the 30 minutes to get BBQ elsewhere."}
{"text":"I read the reviews and I almost didn't want to go to Bubbas. Everyone is a critic! I was expecting the the worst. The place was packed, it was a 45 minute wait. Boy am I glad we waited. The server was pleasant, the food was excellent. It was clean, what more can you want. The whole family was all their working team .   For the critics its BBQ..not the Ritz. Be kind when giving review, I worked in hospitality business for 30 years, Try making everyone Happy . Good Luck! I give Bubbas a 5 Star. Kudos for the hard working Baker Family!"}
{"text":"Love this place   Deboned ribs are to die for. Tender. My wife even liked it! I no longer get ribs anywhere but here.  Good staff and prices are very reasonable. Don't miss out on this place."}
{"text":"Holy crap these ribs are PHENOMENAL. We got them while in town over the holidays and they were probably some of the best ribs I've ever had. I love that they are deboned too. The only downside is that they are expensive. Over $100 for our order for 6 people (came with sides!) but we would come back here next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"A serious shame at how much this place has fallen off.  Bubba's used to be something worth driving out if your way for, but now is not even at the level of a Famous Dave's.  Meat lacks any of the smokiness you would expect from a BBQ restaurant and sides are obviously frozen or from a can.  Even the beans are a canned product, which is inexcusable.    The food used to be worth putting up with the poor service, now you just wait to get disappointed.  I don't know if Bubba let the hype get to him or he is too focused on Shark Tank to care about his restaurant anymore, but it's a shame when anyone with a smoker at home can do a better job than a \"World Famous\" BBC restaurant."}
{"text":"Best bar-b-que (after mine of course). Great service and friendly staff. A must if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Ever since we saw Al Bubba Baker on Shark Tank my oldest son wanted to come to the restaurant and try the boneless ribs. We live on the East Side of Greater Cleveland so this is a hike.   I have never liked boneless products (chicken, ribs, etc.). He ordered the boneless ribs and I ordered St. Louis.  Both were delicious and now I wonder why anyone else can't make boneless products taste like they taste bone-in because these ribs were EXACTLY the same. They've got a great rub and the sauce they serve with each is sharp and tangy. We bought a bottle of the sauce and the rub.  Al Bubba Baker was at the restaurant until about 6 pm, and he spoke to many of the tables. The main dining room was packed and there was a 20-minute wait at 6 pm on a Saturday. But there is a back \"outdoor\" area that is enclosed, has a fireplace and is actually warmer than the front room.  I read a lot of complaints about service. We didn't experience any of that. We got in our orders right away and food came out quickly (and we were served cornbread and other bread in between)."}
{"text":"I was very impressed.  The boneless ribs and fried chicken here were very good.  I have not been impressed with any Ohio bbq, which pains me as a Buckeye, yet loving authentic bbq.  The ambiance here is no more exciting than a cafeteria with tvs, but they did have the Buckeyes on."}
{"text":"HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT and OVER HYPED.        People eat at Bubba Q's for quality and memorable food.  We had neither.  I don't think we will be returning here because the ribs we ate were nowhere near award winning.       There were only a few positives.  The servers were excellent: they were on the floor constantly asking customers for anything else and refills.  The other positive is that we went between lunch and dinner on a Thursday afternoon where it wasn't very busy or crowded.        That said, even though it wasn't busy we still waited almost 25 minutes for food.  We were excited and anticipating something decent.  We had refills on water and iced teas.  At around 15 minutes of waiting we eventually became enticed with the special drinks menu and ordered A hard lemonade.  Now, I grew up with rib cook offs in Parma and Cleveland and I know that if you want GREAT ribs it's worth the wait.  I ordered the Bubba's-Q-Sampler and my roommate ordered the 1/2 slab of ribs.  We were still excited and after the wait I was immediately questioning the sampler sizes when the food arrived.  I noticed in ALL the pictures before me other mac-n-cheese and chili side dishes or samples that they were in LARGER black containers so I know I'm not just being picky.  My mac-n-cheese and chili arrived in those clear containers you get for salad dressings and sauces to go.  YES! That small!  So, to sum up the sampler I received, there was a sauce cup of mac-n-cheese, a sauce cup of chili, 3 ribs and handful of pulled pork.  HUGE disappointment for $16.99!!  The pulled pork was the best part of the sampler; tender and tasty.  The ribs though were a HUGE disappointment.  They had to have been microwaved.  The edges of the ribs were rock hard.  My roommates ribs were even worse than mine.  One of the ribs was not even edible it was so hard.  How can they serve ribs that have been microwaved? Were they sitting around and they didn't want them to go to waste??  HUGE disappointment and upsetting for an establishment that has done many good things and has a great reputation for ribs.        Overall, Bubba's get's two stars because the servers were nice and the environment was pleasant.  Since this lunch was a gift to my roommate and we were thoroughly let down, we will not be returning here."}
{"text":"Al Bubba Bakers talks a big game on TV interviews and he certainly plays to win that game! The boneless ribs were unbelievably good! I recommend a double helping of the best baked beans ever! The beans were loaded with meat and cooked just right. If you are from Boston and think your Mama makes good Boston baked beans then don't tell her how good these are. It will hurt her feelings! Good job Al!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our meal. Kids eat free (with entree purchase) on Tuesdays, and the kids ribs were excellent. The chili, de-boned ribs, sweet potato fries and pork were very good. The staff was very friendly and efficient. Ambiance was ok."}
{"text":"Southern Fried Chicken the bomb, food was hot and so was Bubba's son! Most definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"Excellent ribs! Bubba's friendly and knowledgeable. He's perfected his ribs over 11 years in the business and cook off competition. His Mac and cheese, and baked beans are homemade and the real deal. Bubba played for The Detroit Lions first!"}
{"text":"What a dump and horrible....rephrase...NO SERVICE. There were a couple employees walking around the dining area nonchalant, meanwhile we sat at our table for 10 minutes not even acknowledged, not even given a glass of water. There were about 5 empty tables so it's not like they were slammed. Oh, and my menu cover didn't even have a menu in it.  In addition, it was freezing in the restaurant and they had the ceiling fans still going. All of the guests had their jackets on, fully zipped.   Finally, the waitress approached our table.....as we were standing up to leave. If it takes that long just to be acknowledged I can only imagine how long the evening would have been to get a cocktail, get a menu, order, eat and pay. I'm never in a rush when I go out to eat, I do like taking my time and enjoying my time out, but I wasn't about to pull an all nighter because of poor service.   Someone call Robert Irvine, stat!!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and it was terrible both times. I hate giving bad reviews but sometimes you have too. My experience at Bubba Q's was awful. We ordered a family style meal & let me tell you for the price we paid and the amount of food that was given was terrible. The side dishes for a family of 4 are really enough for maybe 2 people at the most. Honestly, my husband could've eaten all the sides by himself. Our chicken was raw in the middle. They gave us butter knives to cut meat. Why?? We asked for steak knives but never got them. The ribs were nothing to brag about. They were the tiniest ribs I've ever seen besides those ones on a Chinese buffet. And my ribs were so burnt on the ends, you couldn't eat them. I complained, I was told that's how ribs are served. Seriously? Where? I can get better ribs at Applebee's!And the bbq sauce?? Just wasn't good. I really wanted to like this place, that's why we went twice but never again. I'll either make my bbq at home or just ride on over to Famous Dave's in North Olmsted. Shame on you Bubba Baker. Serve some better quality food, do t burn it, but please make sure it's cooked all the way! Either lower your prices or give bigger portions & hire some friendly people."}
{"text":"I have been to Bubba-Qs about 4 times now, 2 for take out and 2 eat in.  Eating in was fun.  Its a funky place, high ceilings; very few tables for the number that might fit.  Service was fine.    The best item to me on the menu is the fried chicken.  Its a fantastic recipe.  I think better than the ribs.   The ribs are very good.  For the first time I ordered the boneless.  What fun eating them without my fingers.  Enjoyable and simple.  I will order them again.  Taste great; texture and quality very high.  I see why they win awards.  Sides are weak primarily from being just a bit too small.  Kind of tiny containers of sides.   Like what you would expect for a condiment.  I am told the Mac & Cheese was fantastic.   Its not a high end fancy place.  Its a homey place.  Owned I think by one of the Ex browns from all the news and memorabilia.  Which is cool.  Definitely a place to try and put into your rotation."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this bbq place in the new neighborhood, but it was just lacking in the food and terrible on the customer service side/caring about customer policy.   Food was ok, nothing too amazing. After I tried it, I said to my husband, I thought it would be at least like Famous Dave's- not a very high bar in my opinion to start with.  Especially for a non-chain!  Pulled pork sandwich was just meh. Pork was dry and portion size was lacking. Mac n cheese was ok- but pretty sure it's the velveeta packet that got it there. Creamy, which is yummy, but nothing special. Sweet potato fries were good. But NOT worth the upcharge! (See below- they have a case of the upcharges) I think they care about the money over the food-- what genuine BBQ joint puts a bottle of ketchup on the table and NOT a bottle of their BBQ sauce?? I would bet you an upcharge that a side of BBQ is an upcharge! For shame.   Hubby wanted the smoked chicken, but they were out. To which the waitress suggested they could sub 2 chicken breasts. Cool. She also said they had green bean casserole. Awesome.  His meal came with 1 and 1/2 chicken breast. GBC was straight up school cafeteria style from a can. Corn bread muffin could be used as a pelting object- not quite concrete grade to knock out a tooth but would leave a mark.   But the worst part-- the BILL!! Turns out Bubba Q's has a case of the upcharges!! I hate this so much in a restaurant. 'Here are all our sides: $2.50. OH-wait- you chose THAT one!! $1 upcharge!'  Just put it in another category!!!   Or when it is not on the menu- the waiter better say it or NOT charge it. Only gets me more pissed that it's for dumb stuff like green bean casserole! Why would that cost more than baked beans? They act like someone handmade the casserole! Oh yeah- the probably did open all those cans by hand! Upcharge!!   I even brought it up to the waitress, who knew it was our first time there and she was like- oops, I should have mentioned the upcharges! The meal we wanted was $12.99- the subbed meal with 'two(read 1 1/2 small chicken breasts) was $14.98. Why?? Because upcharge baby!!  She even said 'gee, you probably think Bubba Q's is all about the nickel and diming' but didn't fix the bill. So yeah, I don't think it, I know it. Insult to injury when she knew she should have told us and didn't, and then copped to it but didn't fix it. As a note- I still left a classy tip- 15% rather than my usual 20% and above.   I won't be returning. I hear Wendy's BBQ pork is better? yikes-- bar has been lowered further!!"}
{"text":"Got a groupon and tried this place on the way to Detroit.   The food was a meal for 2 people (could have fed more).    The BBQ itself was excellent.   The meat was tender and the sauces was very good.   Their cornbread is a little weird, tasted more like angel food cake.   My husband loved it, but it was too weird for me.   The service was good (but we came at an off time and there weren't many tables).   The inside is what I would expect from their brand, looks like we were eating outside at a BBQ.   The drawback was our particular meal didn't really have any sides.  So we had to order them out of pocket.   It was decent.   The food in all is good and worth it if you have a groupon....."}
{"text":"My experience at bubbas Q was great, this is  my second time dining here.The food was amazing and the service and staff were on point. We enjoyed appetizers and cocktails on the outside patio with some friends. I highly recommend the deboned ribs and St Louis ribs !!!"}
{"text":"Bubba has a very nice place and has a nice assortment of barbecue to offer.  Good good and good service.  If you are looking for barbecue you will enjoy Bubba's."}
{"text":"I haven't had a dining experience this terrible all the way around in a while. We went here because we had a Groupon for this restaurant for a BBQ sampler. As soon as we got there we noticed it was busy which is normal because it was a Friday night. There were about 4 groups waiting in front of us and all the tables in the restaurant were full. No one was at the hostess stand to take our name and after waiting for 15 min. for someone to come over my bf went to the takeout counter and asked if there was someone we could give our name. He got a curt \"someone will be right with you\" so he walked away. All in all we waited 45 minutes to be seated and during that time there were plenty of tables open just no one to put us there. During this time everyone that worked there it seemed had time to go outside for multiple smoke breaks and have fights with each other that we could here from the waiting area. The waitress was doing the best she could and our food came out quickly. The pulled pork and brisket were clearly microwaved in a bowl before being served and were bland. The ribs had flavor and would have been better if someone removed the cartilage on the back of the ribs before serving them. The only thing that was decent was the chicken however I'm convinced it could have been cooked longer. Don't waste your time at this place."}
{"text":"I have always wanted to try Bubba's so when I saw a Groupon I decided it was time to go try it.  We bought the dinner for 2 for $17.  The dinner included 1/4 slab baby back rib, 1/4 slab St. Louis style ribs, 1/4 chicken, pulled pork, beef brisket, salad, corn muffins, fries, coleslaw & baked beans.  Let me start by saying there was plenty of food for the 2 of us (and the Groupon was a great deal) however the food that was there was not good.  The baby back ribs were burnt and I mean burnt to a crisp to the point they were crunchy.  We may have liked the rest of the food better than the baby back ribs, however we felt everything needed additional bbq sauce and the bbq sauce had a very weird taste to it (almost like it was spoiled).  If we added the additional bbq sauce it just made the food inedible.  The fries were cold and tasted like they were cooked a few days earlier.  The only thing we both said was good was the coleslaw.  Very disappointed and will never go back."}
{"text":"Mediocre food with poor service time and time again.   I figured I'd give this place another shot after the bad service I got about a year ago. I least i can say they are consistent!  The ribs taste is acceptable. The side dishes are poor. And the service is SLOW. It baffles me how it can take 25 minutes (I used a stopwatch) from the time our server entered the order into the computer to the time our food came out. Our table ordered two slabs of ribs with Mac and cheese, baked beans and coleslaw for sides.  The server brought out a baked potato instead of baked beans which she corrected quickly.  About half of the tables in the place were full.  The servers are no were to be seen. Our drinks sat empty 15 mintues before offering a refill.  The high chair they gave us was dirty. Fruit flies flying around our table. I really want to love this place. I love bbq and the browns. It has great potential. But they need a serious overhaul. I won't be back."}
{"text":"This is the 3rd time going here. I think we are done.  1st time we were told a party of 5 was an odd number and after waiting an hour and watching parties of 6 being seated, we left.2nd time was just me and the husband. The brisket bites aka burnt ends were awesome as was the 3 tablespoons of Mac n cheese. The ribs were pretty good. Which brings us back the 3rd time with our oldest son. Burnt ends are now $9 for about 1/4 cup. Crazy. All 3 of us ordered the baby back dinners. My ribs were tender and delicious. My husband and son had to try to rip their meat off the bones. We ended up takin theirs home and to simmer and cook for a few more hours. Mac and cheese was still good. The cornbread was a joke. A petrified, dried hockey puck. The price are too high for it to be this inconsistent. Makes me sad"}
{"text":"Ok, it looks like a bunch of the uneducated BBQ folks wrote reviews. If you don't like BBQ you shouldn't go here. If you do like BBQ (and know what you're talking about when it comes to Q) you should go here.  Great place - order the boneless ribs - it's their speciality. Don't order anything else except the boneless rib dinner with the sides. It's great! If you don't think so then you don't know BBQ. My Kansas City roots and American Royal judge, 7 years in Memphis, 3 years in Brunswick, Ga and now 6 years in Texas makes me the foremost expect on BBQ joints and this place is real good."}
{"text":"Yes, it's plastered all over that he was on shark tank but I have to say that the service is subpar and the food was the same. I would much rather have Famous Daves any day. I mean when I think BBQ I immediately think homemade food...instant mashed potatoes and Jiffy cornbread muffins are not my idea of BBQ."}
{"text":"This review deals with the on-line ordering of the ribs.    To quote Will S. \"Service, service, service\" .  I ordered and paid the ribs on 5/513.  They were supposed to be shipped within 5-10 business days.  I call on 5/19 (the 10th business day) and was told the had to order more ribs.  Around the 21st I giot an email that said they would ship by the end of the week.  On the 28th I called and they said they started shipping the previous night shift.  End of day on the 29th, they still haven't shipped/  I cancelled the order.    If you can plan a month or so ahead, then this is where you can get ribs.  For me it is not worth it."}
{"text":"Love Bubba's BBQ. Been going since we saw Al Baker on \"Shark Tank.\" We always order the MVP. It's a platter of BBQ ribs, chicken, shredded pork, and brisket with two sides and cornbread muffins. Feeds four. We like the friendly service, and sometimes we see Mr. Baker. I want to try the fried chicken that people give good reviews on. Sometime I may do a carry out of chicken. Try Bubbas."}
{"text":"Very impressed!  It's not often I get out to Avon but had to try the famous Bubba Qs!  Bubba greeted us at the door and he joyously was telling stories to anyone interested.  I couldn't get over how friendly he was and the rest of the staff too actually.  We went for lunch on Saturday and service was quick and with a smile.  The food was great too.  We shared a Q42 (umm..took me too long to get that, oops).  Brisket was tender, pork was mouth watering, chicken was moist but with a great crust and the ribs were TV worthy!  Very happy with everything and the price reflected what I would have expected.  I'd be back for sure...Avon doesn't look as far as it did before lunch!"}
{"text":"Thursday the 9th of Sept. saw Babba, his wife and daughter on a morning talk show in Cleveland and decided to try out the place for dinner.  Now keep in mind that we live almost 2 hours away.  The restaurant was very clean, we were immediately seated and had our drinks ordered. The servers were friendly and always had a smile on their faces. We ordered the D-Bone ribs (full order) and the BBQ sample also( this consists of 1/2 of a chicken, pulled pork, brisket, and 2 -1/2 slabs of different ribs). I am not a real rib person, but when eating the D-Bone ribs, I was amazed on how  good they were. The price is a little high for their dinners but the food is wonderful.  We had a piece of cheesecake which we shared, which by the way was out of this world, and had so much food left over that we boxed it up and served again for dinner the following evening.  We will definitely make another trip to Bubba's Q and plan on taking some of our friends with us, so that they can have the enjoyment of eating at Bubba's too. Oh by the way, we had the pleasure of meeting Bubba himself that evening."}
{"text":"The reviews on this place seem very unfair! We came during prime dinner hour on Sunday. There was a wait for seating inside but opted for immediate seating on the patio. Service was swift and our waitress was VERY friendly.   My boyfriend ordered the mozzarella squares. I had a bite and they were very good! The breading was a bit thick but the mozzarella was hot and stringy (like it should be) and the marinara was unexpectedly tasty. The cornbread bites were okay but nothing special. We split the MVP- 1/2 smoked chicken, pulled pork, brisket, St. Louis and baby back ribs. The portion sizes were HUGE! We have two boxes of leftovers! Here's the breakdown- Brisket: nice smoke ring, nice smoke flavor, tender but a tad overly fatty Pulled pork: great tasting, dry in some spots but overall tender, pronounced smoke flavor Chicken: mild smoke, no real smoke ring, breast a bit dry but thigh very juicy St. Louis ribs: tad tough, over sauced, great smoke flavor, thick smoke ring, awesome crust Baby back ribs: perfectly sauced, great crust, great smoke flavor but the pork flavor came through, tender and fall off the bone Overall a great and well worth it meal. Next time I'm sticking to the baby back ribs though! They're, in my opinion, the best locally. The sauce is really delicious too! A must try!"}
{"text":"Surprised to find low ratings.  Too bad about the negative experiences, since those may have been isolated and rare, i.e. newly hired/inexperienced servers/cooks, understaffed due to last minute sickness/emergency, etc.  Some things are beyond the control of restaurant owners.  I just happen to be a more patient type, I guess, and as long as the service is friendly and attentive I'm willing to wait for something I've asked for.  After a couple of minutes, I'll just wave/signal the server, and simply remind them.  Was there in August 2011 and had one of the best---maybe THEE best---fried fish dinner I've ever had in a restaurant---and I've sampled enough of them over the years to recognize thoughtful preparation. That was a few months ago, but I believe it was Lake Erie Perch.  Lightly coated, perfectly fried, and a generous portion.  The crisp fries, too, were just right.  Tartar sauce had a pleasant mellowness with a touch of sweetness.  Was likely made in-house, since it was nothing at all like those typically served elsewhere---overly sharp, too sweet, or just plain strange.  And the cole slaw was fabulous.  Why can't restaurants ever get this right?  When I told our server how delicious everything was, he said that the fish and coleslaw were his mother's recipes. As it turned out, our smiling, friendly server was Bubba's son.  This dinner was what I'd expect to find at an exclusive upscale resort for triple the price.  My husband's St. Louis ribs were equally tasty.  After eating about 3 or 4 ribs, he realized the other end hadn't been thoroughly smoked---still slightly under-done.  No problem at all.  Within a very short time a larger full slab----and more sincere apologies---arrived at our table.  Though filling ourselves up, we left with enough fish, ribs, and fries for two meals the next day.  Hope they've continued offering fish on their menu, since we're planning on more visits during Lent.  Will call them.  (Ironically, though, this is hardly a sacrifice.  More like an indulgence!)"}
{"text":"From service to the food this place is top notch! We were seated by the cutest 7 year old (Bubba's granddaughter) and had such great service. Al \"Bubba\" Baker was walking around the whole time asking everyone how they liked everything. He is such a nice guy! My family shared the \"MVP\" and it could've fed an army. The boneless ribs are to die for. I can go on and on about the sides too. The mac and cheese was perfect and the coleslaw was the best I've ever had. All around great atmosphere...even the music was excellent!!! We will definitely be back...very soon!"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this in our quest for a solid BBQ place in Cleveland. We did like Bubba's, and the actual meat is good, but all of the sides are really mediocre. They arent nasty, but they are just so-so. They all taste kind of generic and like they came from a box. We really do love the ribs and brisket, and would come here regularly if the sides were better. I'm still giving it 4 stars because the actual BBQ is good, and because the employees were nice. They also have really great looking desserts in a case in the front, which we haven't tried, but that seem to be pretty popular. If Bubba's would step up their game with the sides, it would be a really awesome place!"}
{"text":"Good BBQ, but pricey. Food portions seem generous enough but for a family of two adults and two toddlers we paid $60 out the door..."}
{"text":"We told waitress we were in a hurry traveling from NY to Chicago. We ordered just the appetizer of burnt ends - waited and waited. The girl comes out and says somehow the ticket didn't go through. Anyhow food comes out.....it was tough, not like any burnt ends that should taste dark and tender. These were square hunks....and not tender and to boot- they tasted so salty. Have eaten top notch BBQ all over the US and this isn't it at least for the burnt ends. Try's SMOQUES when you're in Chi-town or Q BBQ in Naperville, Il. Rudy's in San Antonio or Austin but not here."}
{"text":"This is as good as it gets. Having grown up in Texas, this is pretty on par with all of the road-side bbqs that we have across the interstates.  The only thing better would be the brisket at the Houston Rodeo.  The green beans and everything else were pretty amazing as well.  The food came pretty promptly, and was glad to have something like back home.    The place seemed more of a place for locals, but nonetheless, it was great."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor, and order at least these two foods: fried chicken and beef brisket. O yea, and the chili. Bubba's bbq sauce is delicious. Corn bread is equally delicious. I'd choose the sweet fries over the regular fries. Outstanding service by Bubba's own daughter is a delight. Great smile and extra attentive. Chill atmosphere and clean. Happy days!!!"}
