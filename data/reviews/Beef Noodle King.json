{"text":"Don't waste your money! Considering the name of the restaurant is Beef Noodle King, you'd think the beef noodles would be somewhat decent. The noodles were overcooked, there was no flavor and depth in the broth except saltiness and the meat was absolutely flavorless. My boyfriend ordered the tripe noodles and it was equally as awful with the tripe being overcooked and soft as jelly. We were appalled by the Taiwanese sausages. $8 for a plate of scattered thinly sliced sausages? It tasted unusual too, so it was mind blowing how awful it was. Needless to say, we felt completely ripped off and wondered why the place hasn't closed down yet."}
{"text":"Husband and I were searching for places for dinner and passed by this restaurant tonight. When we walked in, the restaurant was awfully quiet. Then we ordered our food-beef noodles and pork rice. The taste was not that great and the portion was small for the price. The soup base of the beef noodles wasn't that great either, not sure how and why they charge so much. There were only three tables at 7pm tonight where other restaurants in the area were super packed. Not coming back again, it is a mistake that we didn't check the review first."}
{"text":"The waitstaff is one of the most inefficient I've encountered in Markham. Nothing depicts inefficiency quite like the sight of a waitress talking with kitchen staff while an order of food sits on the kitchen counter for 5 minutes, previously occupied tables remain uncleared for 3 minutes, and customers' tea cups aren't refilled within 7 minutes--especially when restaurant seating is less than 30% full.   Note to the waitstaff: if you're standing around the room seemingly doing nothing when these tasks remain to be done, YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG. It's little inefficiencies with the waitstaff combined with some sluggishness in the kitchen that resulted in my food being delivered almost 45 minutes after order placement.  Was the food worth the wait? Hardly. I ordered a basic round noodle dish with fish balls, which was only middling in quality. Contrary to a gastronomic proverb, hunger does not make the best spice when it is induced by extreme wait times. If you're looking for Taiwanese food that this place supposedly specializes in, Mei Nung Noodle House at First Markham Place or some food stall at Pacific Mall would be  better choices.  Sidenote: beware of the wacky Feng Shui'd seating arrangement of this place. The seating arrangement of the inner tables forces some patrons in the centre of the room to face the booths lining the windows, so any loud conversations produced in centre will blasted directly into ears of people seated next to the windows. This, combined with potentially long wait times for food can be agonizing if groups seated in the centre consist of screaming kids with parents who forgot to take Russell Peters advice to discipline their kids \"reaaaaal bad.\""}
{"text":"The other reviewers were not wrong.  We were in Markham last night and needed to get a quick dinner. The menu in the window showed all the right menu items so we thought why not? It was not crowded so we thought it would be fast...bad mistake.  We ordered for 2 adults and one child a combo for 2 and a 1 person combo.  Cold tofu with preserved egg was good but the idea of bringing side plates to eat a dish meant for sharing seemed foreign to the server. She needed to be asked 3 times and the first time she brought knife and fork instead. Oyster omelette had a big sign in the window. Hardly any oysters in it, not much egg either, mostly fried starch paste. Didn't eat the sauce. Beef noodle soup had small amounts of tough meat, pretty sad for a place that has beef noodle soup in its name. Shaved ice with mangoes was good. The server kept telling stories about how the patrons at the next table drive out of their way to eat theirs. She also had some choice comments about my son's body habitus, which no doubt she will be sharing with other patrons after we are gone. My son didn't like his chicken wing dinner.  Service was slow....and rude. Each dish brought out at a different time, as if the kitchen could not cook one till it was finished cooking the previous. Drinks the same way. When we were done my husband waited 10 minutes after the server cleared the tables before he went up to find out what was going on. Server had our bill ready but didn't bother to bring it to our table. And the restaurant was mostly empty. Took us over 1 1/2 hours. Bill was over $70, no alcohol. They do not take credit cards so bring cash if you plan to eat here after reading this. We're not coming back."}
{"text":"Like the stinky tofu here and the noodles are good too, just be prepared to come out stinky smelling though!"}
{"text":"Someone once told me if you go to a place with a machine gun and can't kill anyone, don't bother trying out the place.  Definitely a punishment for not listening to that.  We can't really complaint about the service considering we were the only people in the restaurant around 7pm.  Even with that, the place got the slowest cook ever.  Come 8pm, 2 more small table got filled.  All look really disappointed and eat very quietly.  Let's recap on their \"house specialty items\": Beef Noodle... Failed Oyster omelette... Failed Marinated intestine... Failed Stinky tofu... Failed Iced black tea... Tasted ok... Passed!?  Conclusion.. Don't go!!!"}
{"text":"I don't know if I should even give one star or not. This place are definitely not a place to go. Such waste of money..over price. Food are bad."}
{"text":"Should've checked out the reviews before going there.  Definitely will not be going there again. Service was fine, but the food was....blah....  We went there for desserts since we wanted to try their Taiwanese shaved snow ice. We had the mango, and the taste was very artificial, similar to powdered made bubble tea. Also comes with only red bean, boba, or jelly. The authentic shaved snow ice should come with fresh fruits and lots of condensed milk.  I've tried the one at Cha.Me.Cha and the taste is much better, also still lacking on the toppings. The one at The Golf Lounge and Frozen Dessert is the closest I've had for authentic snow ice.  Not impressed at this place at all."}
{"text":"Read other 1-star reviews!! They are very accurate and fair. No need for me to repeat everything that has been said....to summarize, overpriced, NOT authentic, not even close! It baffles me how they manage to stay in business when surrounded by dozens of amazing authentic fine Asian restaurants."}
{"text":"Terrible service and food. The waiter showed a great reluctance when taking my order and their specialty on the menu was not even available. Also, they also only accept cash."}
{"text":"I think the food is decent but on the expensive side.  I ordered stinky tofu which tasted good, however for $7 plus I expected larger pieces with sour cabbage on the side.  I order a plate of veggie & it came with cabbage only for $4.99.  Noodles are $9 plus but if you want a quiet little place to eat with guaranteed seating, is a good choice.  $35 for 2 with no drinks."}
{"text":"So ridic, I never knew a restaurant could be this bad. The service was slow, our waitress was inefficient and unpleasant (blatantly taking her stress out on customers), the food was bland and made with cheap ingredients. We ordered this dish that was literally noodles with rousong (pork floss) on top, which you can buy in any asian supermarket. I could have made these dishes in my home for free.  I was disappointed mainly because where I'm from, it's rare to find a restaurant that caters specifically to Taiwanese cuisine. WELL, Beef Noodle King totally misled me with their advertisements of oyster pancake, shaved ice, minced pork on rice... everything turned out to be so basic and bland with hardly any seasonings or aromatics. We went in at about 7 pm and the complete lack of diners should have been an indication that something was wrong.  It was probably management at fault. They had ONE waitress working dinner shift. So strange..."}
{"text":"Oh how I regret not yelping a place for review before going in!! I guess my punishment is to sit through this -.-''   This hidden place behind the busy First Markham Place plaza is NOT a hidden secret that needs to be discovered. I was curious and excited when I saw their menu, they have stinky to-fu and oyster omelette! 2 of my favourites in outdoor Asian food festivals such as Taste of Asia or Night market. Beef noodle king ruined it for me!   The oyster omelette had amost NO oyster, and to accompany the omelette they served regular BBQ sauce rather than the savoury brown soy bean paste usually put on top. I didn't know they can make boot-leg version of street food.   I also decided to try the Taiwan special clear noodles with sesame chicken because it had a \"house-speciality\"  label next to it. I was VERY disappointed.  The sesame chicken had no flavour, broth was simply with chicken broth, and chicken pieces thats boiled regualrly with no marinating. It was exactly like something I can put together at home. I might as well eat a pack of instant noodle, at least my taste bud could be satisfied by some MSG. Bland, tasteless, flavourless.   The waiter kindly notified I receive a free drink for lunch, horray......? My iced lemon tea tasted like watered down tea with just a hint of sugar.   Alice, next time you read this, DON'T COME HERE."}
{"text":"Beef Noodle King seems to be new but feels old. If you have been to Taipei Station, the previous restaurant in the same unit, you will understand what I mean.  With the change of name, the interior deco stays the same. The menu though condensed quite a bit, a great improvement.  The lunch special is really simple, just order any noodle/rice dish, you get a free drink of choice (iced lemon tea, iced/hot tea, coke, sprite).  Beef Noodle Soup ($7.99) served steaming hot! I do enjoyed that and the noodle was cooked al dente with a great bite. But sadly the soup was bland and quite one dimensional. Beef was tender but with just a few pieces. Portion size is small, good for a snack but does have an option of extra vegetables (+$1) and noodles (+1).  There are still quite a few durian items on the menu: ice, soy bean drink, milk drink. I might give it a try next time.  There are quite a few combos for dinner, afternoon tea and all day combo. But $15 for a dinner combo for 1 person? definitely on the pricey side!"}
{"text":"Read all the other review, it's pretty accurate. This review might be  a bit late, but it seems like they still have the same issue. One of the worst experience in my life. Me and my friends decided to try this restaurant because it was still relatively new at the time. We were really hungry, and had plans to go play basketball after eatting. Upon arrival, it took awhile for us to get seated. It took awhile for the waitress and waiter to take our order, as they would simply ignore us or give us gesture that that they were coming (and pretty sure they forgot about us as we were still waiting after a  couple minute).  As it was still relatively new (at the time), we saw a bunch of  customers coming but they left as they got tired of standing at the door waiting for even the waiter/waitress to notice them. The food took forever to arrive. We had to ask them 2 times where our food was, and had constantly debated among ourselves whenever we should just leave and go somewhere . We only stayed cause presumption that our food had to be next, and we waited this long already.  After literally 45-50 minutes waiting our food finally arrived. Now to make this long wait time worthwile, they had to hsve the best beef noodle. Sadly, it wasn't. It was pretty bland and nothing particular special. The food wasn't really filling or we were just too hungry. Either way, there was no way we would order again and wait another 45-50 minutes. It wasn't just us either, the other customers were waiting too."}
