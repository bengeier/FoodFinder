{"text":"Take-out joint. Have only got the crispy fried chicken, but it is excellent. It's on another level that KFC, etc. The chicken is crispy and not greasy. Good dipping sauce too."}
{"text":"rotisserie chicken, fries salads, wraps and other goodies.
decent place that needs proper side sauces like Nandos to go with the chicken
kinda bland in the my taste but nice place, great decor and very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Tried this place again on another location and what a difference!! the chicken was done just right --- moist, tasty and juicy. The  chicken wings were perfect also. I was even more impressed w the grilled veggies as it was grilled to perfection -- not over or undercooked and has the nice char to it. This time we got the gravy also which was super tasty. What surprised me the most was their dessert (not sure what it was called as it wasnt on the menu) but it was phyllo roll with some kind of cheese filling in it... yummm. Service was prompt (I called ahead and picked it up) and service was with a smile also. Two thumbs up :)"}
{"text":"I got a flyer in my mailbox and I made an order at Bariseryy for the first time. I originally wrote a review for that meal, and my original review was not stellar to put it bluntly. I had many issues with how the food was presented on the website (it is unfinished and does not contain any pictures and/or accurate pictures at the time of this review) as well as the flyer. Some of the food items were bizarrely different from what I expected. 

But the one really amazing thing about this particular restaurant is that the owner/manager gave me a call to see if he could make things right. He explained to me that the website was basically under construction, and that this was probably the source for some of the errors. He sent over a care-package last night with different food items, mostly containing items that I would have wanted to order the first time.

The roasted chicken - which I think was the Herbs & Garlic variety - that was sent to me had a really nice blend of spices - it was quite good, although maybe a bit fatty on the dark meat pieces. I would generally give it a favourable rating though. 

On my first order, I meant to order the roasted chicken, but instead I got the crispy chicken pieces - the breaded kind that resemble what you'd get from Kentucky Fried Chicken. The lack of images on the website caused me to make a mistake while I was ordering on my phone. To be honest, I really wasn't a fan of the crispy chicken - they were not healthy enough for my liking and heavy, but if you like that sort of thing, then you'll probably enjoy it. I don't think I would like crispy chicken from any restaurant, regardless of how good it tasted, so take this comment for what it's worth.

They also sent some vegetable rice as a side dish, and it's pretty tasty - although a bit on the salty side - you can't have too much of it if you don't typically put a lot of salt in your food. I'd recommend less salt to the chef, but it was otherwise fine.

The cubed potatoes they sent were extremely tasty. They were definitely on the greasy side, but if you don't care about that, you'll enjoy the spices and the soft texture to them. I admittedly ate all of them last night, although I'm sure I'll have to eat really healthy for the next little while to undo the damage, lol.

On my first order, I had thought I ordered these potatoes, but instead they sent home made fried potato chips. Apparently they have *5* different types of potatoes, so if you don't want the potato chip variety, be sure to be specific and perhaps avoid ordering on-line until they make their website MUCH clearer. Also, the flyer did not have pictures of any type of potatoes other than what they sent me in this care package, so I feel like they really need to be clear about these menu options and images - especially on smaller displays like mobile phones.

On my previous order, I had ordered a \"Fresco Fried Chicken Sandwich\". All of the pictures of their sandwiches and wraps look identical at the time of this review - so it was really difficult to know for sure what I was going to get. The actual item did not look like any of the pictures I'm afraid, and I found the bread to be of low quality - I would definitely not recommend any of the sandwiches that use this style of bread. And they REALLY need to fix their website so that if something is a wrap, then the website only shows a wrap - and so on.

I also ordered a \"Grilled Chicken Wrap\" on my first order, and it was quite tasty. It's totally not healthy and was quite greasy, but if you don't care about that sort of thing, then you'll likely enjoy its taste. I definitely recommend the wraps more than the sandwiches.

One good thing about Braiseryy is that they give fantastic portions for your money - on both my first order and on the care package. You won't go hungry, that is for sure. The value is probably unparalleled to most fast food places.

Overall, I think the restaurant was really cool in trying to make things right and sending me a care package. You don't see that a lot in today's world, so I give a huge amount of credit to the owner/manager. Thank you so much for that!

My biggest concern for the restaurant is how it markets itself - is it fast food like KFC, or is it a more upscale restaurant? When some of the food items feature beautiful presentations on wooden plates or square dishes - or even the wine glasses on their homepage - it gives a more upscaley impression than the food actually warrants. If you know this going in, then your expectations will on target and you won't be disappointed.

I also think they really need to fix their website. They need to rely A LOT less on text and more on images to convey menu information. Also, the images need to be ACCURATE - something I feel is quite off.

I'm sure once the restaurant sorts these problems out, and people have the right expectations, the restaurant will be on their way. But I can't give the restaurant a great rating just yet.

{"text":"We stumbled upon this place by accident and we're glad we did. Everything was fresh, tasty and the service was great as well. We watched hand-battered chicken go right into a pressure cooker and 20 minutes later...it was worth it.  Great fried chicken. Mo was a fantastic proprietor and the reason for the extra (and 4th) star. For $30, we had a delicious and filling meal for 2 - with leftovers. Go check it out. You'll enjoy it!"}
{"text":"I walked in to order 9 pieces and three sides today. Asked if they were new, was told, yeah very shortly and bluntly. No hospitality at all. Waited for my food, no problems. Asked the China dude for hot sauce he didn't answer. Asked him five minutes later he told me to take it easy. I said I am taking it easy that he hadnt answered my first time around so is didn't know if he had heard me. He told me he always gives hot sauce rudely. I told him this is my first time here I didn't know. That he didn't respond to my initial request and that telling somebody to take it easy is basically calling them rude. He told me he wasn't being rude. That isn't what I said I said you're calling ME rude. And btw you are being rude and ignorant. Then I told him I don't know where he learned how to take care of business and left and will obviously never be back. Pathetic. Food was great. But cashier / manager and cook were seriously unprofessional, rude and like I said pathetic. I'm no complainer but business is tough nowadays so making it even tougher on yourself is pathetic. Pathetic. Pathetic. Pathetic. I'll spend my money with people who are professional and not pathetic. Ps email on website is wrong. Pathetic."}
{"text":"I ordered the Five piece grilled chicken using the Foodora app and they forgot half of the order. When I called to ask if they could send it they said \"No, That's not our fault, we gave the food to the driver and there's nothing we can do\" So I called Foodora and they said they'd handle it and get me a refund. The chicken was covered in oil! Way too much oil! It didn't taste that great. Very disappointed with this. I'd avoid altogether."}
{"text":"Ordered the $49.99 17 fried chicken combo deal with 3 sides
Chicken was good, french fries side were a joke, less than a quarter of the bowl and the other 2 sides were only 2/3 full.  Not worth the money"}
{"text":"First thing to note is that this location is not closed.

I purchased a Groupon for $9.60 for $20.00 worth of takeout food. I figured for that price, I really couldn't go wrong. There are some pros and cons about this establishment though.

Pros: I ordered a whole, flat grilled chicken and it was exceptional ($18.99). It was cooked thoroughly and crispy on the outside but still moist and juicy on the inside. The Brazilian spices had an Indian influence but there was also a little hint of Jerk. I know it sounds unusual but the flavours married very well. The condiments were a tomato-based hot sauce and a very garlicy tzatziki-style sauce. It was a great dish and I would buy it again.

Con #1: they should pay a professional firm to revamp the website and menu because it is very confusing. I spent at least 10 minutes talking to the guy trying to understand the pricing.

Con #2: without the Groupon, it is quite pricy. The sides, for example, are $6.00 a container. The guy tried to sell me three sides for $9.00 as it obviously seemed like a better deal. The caveat was that the three sides were all going in the one container so I opted out altogether as that's no deal in my opinion. The bill came to about $21.50 with tax.

Food = 5 stars
The cons = 2 stars
Overall rating = 3.5 stars"}
{"text":"You know what - great little take out spot.   The whole grilled chicken comes wrapped in this crispy thin roti flat bread thing (great touch) and 2 little containers of garlic sauce and not the crappy processed stuff either, this is legit homemade Mediterranean garlic sauce.   

Chicken is on point, not much to say not drowning in overly salty peri peri like sauce, this is nicely seasoned and marinated char grilled chicken goodness.

Would give this place a 5 star but my only problem is at $19 for the whole chicken I find it on the expensive side."}
