{"text":"Sushi-oriented Review:
I have ordered sushi from several places around Etobicoke, and hands down Gohyang has the best quality sushi & the largest portions for their prices.
I have ordered pick-up from them over 10 times and am always pleased with their timely food preparation. The portions are always large and their packaging is always neat and meticulous. The special rolls are amazing. I have had the Salmon Lover, OMG Roll, Volcano Roll, Gohyang Roll & Spicy Salmon roll, all of which were great. The spicy rolls actually have a bit of a kick, unlike most other locations in Etobicoke. I will continue to order sushi from them for as long as I live in Etobicoke.
 
I have also dined-in 3 times. All 3 times the staff were very friendly and the food was prepared quickly."}
{"text":"I come here a lot.
They have the best fried pork in town.
Their spicy seafood noodle is awesome."}
{"text":"Loved this place- on a trip with my son from Chicago-told about this place at our hotel-  Miso soup was excellent- sushi rolls were top notch- we will be back!  wish it was near our home!"}
{"text":"It's a good place to come... if you are Korean.   

I'm of Asian descent, but not Korean, and the service staff could sniff that a mile away. Took 10 minutes before we decided to just go up to the cashier desk to put in our order - AND ask for some water/tea.

The food we ordered came within 15 minutes (acceptable amount of time) and it was neither exceptional, nor bad... so without the crappy/lack of service, I would have given a 3 star for the food.

Never did any of the servers ask to refill our tea/water. The only reason I bring up the \"Korean\" aspect is that the table that sat next to us obviously spoke Korean and they were waited upon hand and foot. Water/tea brought the table instantly - plates/utensils - appeared in thin air etc.

If that's the mentality of their servers - it's just bad and unintelligent business as we'll never go back again. Also - if you happen to have an infant and your group brings in a car seat - most of the bench tables will not fit the car seat as the seating is very narrow.

This is my second time there. The first time we got take-out, so never noticed the poor service - except that they mentioned that our order would be 20 minutes (over the phone) and when I arrived 35 minutes later to pick it up... it wasn't even ready. Had to wait another 10 minutes.

Fail."}
{"text":"Before trying Gohyang I was never a fan of sushi. This place converted me! We order almost every Friday at office for lunch. Quick, fresh and consistent!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh. What happened to this place?  The service here is horrendous!  I'm not sure if it's because it's under new ownership or something?  It used to be much better... I would give zero stars if I could. 

I bought a Groupon and the Groupon said it was worth $60 for 4 people. I tried to make a reservation for 3 instead of 4. The person I spoke to said you cannot do that, it says so in the Groupon. So I said ok I will make a reservation for 4. She then says if you show up with only 3, you cannot use the Groupon and I have reminded you of this. She said this in a tone that was not very friendly. Then she said so do you want to cancel the reservation? She said it in a way almost like that's what she wanted me to do. I said that I wanted to keep the reservation. And she didn't sound too happy about that. 

Anyhow I changed my mind about going after that experience and called Groupon for a refund which they happily gave. They had outstanding customer service. 

So I call the restaurant back to cancel the reservation and she's like \"ok bye\". Doesn't even ask for my name or anything. 

I'm never coming back here even if their sushi was pretty good. These people should be more customer focussed because there are many good sushi places around there with much better service. I already found my replacement - Sushi Run which is much closer to me too."}
{"text":"Good delivered sushi is hard to find because it takes extra effort to sustain the intended delivery temperature of each item. After our delivery tonight, I am thoroughly impressed with the chef's ability to do just that. Hot items were ventilated and cold items were packed separately in foil lined cartons. The tempura was still crispy and the sushi was not hot. This attention to proper packaging really helped the integrity of the dinner and led to a very enjoyable meal. To me, the proper (or improper) temperature of a Japanese meal is most certainly a deal maker/breaker. Kudos. This was a great Japanese meal."}
{"text":"I love this place, we are regulars. The gampoongi is awesome (deep fried spicy chicken), jajangmyun (black bean sauce noodle dish) and sushi is what we always get. Price is very good, never had a problem with service like other reviewers (I'm also Asian but not Korean)."}
{"text":"Go see gohyang review. Same owner different name. Very rude customer service. Does not respect Groupon's."}
{"text":"Good value and good food, can't really go wrong! My Korean buddy took my here for a late dinner, and I enjoyed it. Sushi is very fresh and tastes great (we got the salmon sushi) which I found surprising (first time experiencing Japanese/Korean cuisine in same restaurant). The sides are okay - onion, kimchi, and pickled beets. 

We also grabbed the seafood noodles in beef black bean sauce for 2; great value @ $7.50 each, you will be full! Only downside was the lack of service button + spoon at table, but regardless a great time."}
{"text":"Their Ja Jung is the best in town!  Also the price is fair.  I find that if you wanted to add a fried egg it is a bit expensive... something like $3 more!!  
Wish they have better side and more than 3.  

The seating is not the most comfortable and decor is lacking.  

Staff is friendly but we were not impressed 1 time when we were the 45mins to closing and we had to place our order for take-out instead of dining in."}
{"text":"Trying to find good sushi in Etobicoke is like finding amazing poutine outside of Quebec... next to impossible! 

It's not that the sushi there is bad per se it just tends to be expensive and/or just ok. Hometown Korean Restaurant cheaper than its Etobicoke siblings but in the end was just ok.

I ordered the Salmon maki roll which came with a miso soup for $5. The rolls where packed with big pieces of salmon with minimal rice (as it should be to allow maximum flavour). 

The miso soup was gross and after a few sips I threw it out. I am curious on how their fancier rolls taste and since they are so close to home I might give them another try."}
