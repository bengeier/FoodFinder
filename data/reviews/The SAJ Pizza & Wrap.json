{"text":"Homemade wraps. Well made wraps.
It was for sure one of the best wrap I've had in Toronto.
(I've only tried the wrap though.)"}
{"text":"I decided to try this place out on a Friday afternoon, and I was very disappointed in the quality of the food and HYGIENE! I found a hair in my wrap, and it definitely wasn't appetizing. Is it too hard to wear a hair net?  Never going back again, food is overpriced too, it's basically roti (what I eat at home) with vegetables and chicken (nothing extraordinary or special)."}
{"text":"I was on the hunt for food after an exam and came here because it is close to campus. It's a small space, with some tables, a flat screen TV, and tons of chalkboards with info on them. 

The menu is above the ordering area and there are a variety of things like wraps, pizza, and crepes. From talking to the owner, I learned that saj is the type of bread they use for everything. It's sort of has the thinness and chewiness of a crepe with a pita kind of feel... it was very yummy. After ordering, he grabbed a little ball of dough and used this giant contraption to squish it and make it super flat and thin and then toasted. I opted for the small (6 inches, $3.99) chicken saj wrap which tasted pretty good (the large is 10 inches for $6.99 I believe). You get to choose what toppings you want and what sauces you would like.

Overall, my wrap was pretty tasty and cheap. I'm quite full after eating a small (however I was not super hungry beforehand). I can't wait to go back and try the pizza and the crepe options... I have no clue how they would make pizza on such a thin dough!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a quick single-person pizza for lunch, this is a good takeout choice."}
{"text":"Went here on a friend's recommendation.

There are some good menu choices but not much variety.
The portions are smaller than you would expect. This place is slightly overpriced.
The service is fast and good.

A decent place to grab a quick bite."}
{"text":"Awesome sujuk pide. The spice in the sujuk was perfect. A recommendation to the business owner: I would hope to see some cucumber and tomatoes next to pide as shown on the images."}
{"text":"Nothing quite extraordinary, but they make a perfectly respectable sandwich for when you're around the U of T campus and need a quick bite. I had the steak saj, which was overall very good. The freshness of the bread, which they cook to order, really came through in the taste. However, the steak was far too chewy, so I ended up pulling big chunks of steak out of the wrap instead of having a smooth top-down eating experience. More tender steak would have been a vast improvement.

A+ for friendly service!"}
{"text":"it's a new restaurant close to university of toronto. I like to stop by to get a light and healthy lunch! they have wraps made from saj bread (very thin layer bread and they make it in front of you). you can choose from different fillings and dressing. they also have a vegetarian choice (Falafel). the ingredients are fresh and you can know whats really in your sandwich! They also have pizza! 

The restaurant is very neat and clean. but it is kind of small ! 
the large wrap with a soft drink is around 8 $. 
the owner (zyad) is very friendly! he usually give the customers informations about the saj method :D"}
{"text":"This place is a great place if you're looking for something quick and on the go. I dont much like the staff here or their sly remarks but the pesto pasta is what keeps me coming back, they use a little too much  olive oil in it but it is still a great pasta."}
{"text":"Such incredible Pizza. The service was pretty quick. Prices seemed reasonable in Canadian dollars. I also got a mango juice which I loved"}
{"text":"After having been at school for a few hours, I was looking for something healthy to eat. I didn't feel like Subway, and the place next door to The Saj (Quick Pita, I think?) looked kind of dirty. So I tried The Saj.

Nice looking, clean place; menu is easy to read, whatever. I ordered a large chicken wrap, expecting grilled chicken breast, as most pita places have. The chicken was cut up, and tossed in some sort of sauce. It was kind of rubbery and you get about half a cup on your wrap (which, being starving, did not impress me). The pita it's served on, like someone else said below, it like a roti. Again, not what I was expecting. It was fine, but I would have preferred a less chewy, thinner pita. My pita came to $7.50. I ate it in about 3 minutes and was still hungry :( 

Overall, I'm disappointed. There wasn't really anything particularly wrong with the place or the food, but for 7 bucks I could have had a much more filling footlong sub a few doors down."}
{"text":"I often visited the SAJ for lunch or dinner when I attended University of Toronto. The food was tasty, especially the SAJ bread/wrap. I often got the steak wrap or the steak pizza. Both were good.

Their dessert SAJ wrap with strawberries and Nutella is also a must try."}
{"text":"The SAJ is an alright place to eat if you're hungry and don't want to go to the place next door (which is better, btw, but I forget the name of it). 

They get three stars because the people there are very friendly and want to make you feel welcome. There's a tv you can watch while you wait and seating area for about 20 people (never seen more than 5 people sitting down at a time though). 

I feel like the prices are too expensive for what you get. If you get a wrap from here, you may as well go get a burrito from Burrito Planet for the same amount and be twice as filled. That being said, the food is good and probably healthier than what's nearby. My only complaint is the pizza. I don't know what it is, but it is definitely not a regular pizza. I feel like there wasn't cheese on it even though there was (I know that sounds weird, but you'd really have to order it to know what I mean, which I don't recommend). Salads are far too overpriced. The crepe is ok, but kind of out of place as it's strawberry and nutella (sweet) mixed in with a whole bunch of savoury items on the menu.

Overall, I would skip the SAJ unless you are looking for a very light meal/snack for an *alright* price. But you won't be disappointed with the service."}
{"text":"The guys most depressing negative energy pessimistic unkind one that brings down ur day"}
{"text":"The food is okay, but it will leave you hungry. The Saj wrap combo is a rip off as 10 dollars will get you a wrap which consists of chicken, sauce and a sprinkle of grated cheese. They wont let you put any toppings in the wrap as there is a side salad included. The side salad consisted of about 5 pieces of iceberg lettuce and 2 slices of tomato without any dressing. The large Saj  Wrap is 6.50 plus taxes and if you get the wrap alone you can put toppings in it. 

Essentially in the saj combo you are getting the wrap for 6.50 and paying 3.50 for dipping sauce and a soda"}
{"text":"I ordered a falafel wrap ($6.49 +tax) from Saj. Initially, I was sold on the concept of healthy fresh unleavened flatbread with no preservatives, cooked on a metal griddle. The flavor of the wrap was very disappointing. 

I was tempted to leave the store after watching the server placing four falafels in a plastic container, then placing it in the microwave. It completely defeats the healthy philosophy displayed proudly on the chalkboard. To be honest, I felt a little deceived. If I wanted \"dead food\" from the dielectric heating of microwave, I could have purchased microwaveable dinner. If I wanted carcinogens along with other harmful toxins in my food, I could have ingested plastic directly. 

Unfortunately, I had already paid for the wrap and felt stuck with it. The falafel for some reason was flattened on the flat bread upon being microwaved. Although I appreciate wrap made from fresh dough, it was not enough to compensate for sub-par microwaved food. 

P.S. Someone please private message me, if you know a good place to eat before class! University of Toronto, St. George Campus is a food desert :("}
{"text":"I don't know why there are so many low ratings of this place. This place has been a favourite of mine since they opened. I can't get enough of their wraps! They make their wraps (including the bread) fresh right in front of you and service is always attentive, quick, and great. Sure the deco and inside isn't up to par with some of the nicer places in downtown, but this place is more for the grab and go type of meals - great for nearby university students! I, for one, loved this place during my undergrad days but now that I'm on the other side of campus, I can't frequent as often. 

Their wraps have a nice chewy texture, sort of like roti, and are nice and thin. But it still holds together nicely, not even four types of saucing are able to tear it apart. They make their bread fresh on this machine that expands the dough, then they bake it a bit on the grill, take it off for you to add your toppings, then stick it back on the grill for a finishing touch. It's nice and hot when you take your first bite and their paper wrapping is easy to tear, nothing will drip in case the wrap does tear. 

They've changed their menu for their wraps since their earlier years; they used to have an option for a smaller portion for about $4, and a 10 inch for $7. Now there's only one option, 11 inch for $7.50. Still a good deal if you ask me!"}
