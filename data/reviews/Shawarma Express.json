{"text":"So... they have good service!  But.... the food leaves a lot to be desired. Just not good take out. Maybe better in store perhaps? Just over processed tasting and lacking in any discernible shawarma taste really. But again, good service!"}
{"text":"Maybe the best way to take a look at what a business offers is just what they offer, nothing else. The mowed lawn from a lawn mower. The dry cleaned clothes from the dry cleaner. The beer from the brewery. The shawarma from the shawarma restaurant. Not the appearance of the business. Not the customer service. Not the location. The product and the product alone.   With my experience of this place, all I can tell you is that the shawarma is top level stuff. Because I ordered via the Just Eat delivery service app, and that this business wasn't on Yelp, I could only judge by what came to our door. By the way, Just Eat is good work. Delivery within an hour, for $3.   Now, I did call the shawarma shop to check on the order, and the thing of note is the guy answered with \"hello.\" And that's it. There's something warming about that. Who knows, this place could be a guy's downstairs kitchen. No clue. But I love it.   I might not ever see this place. But I will order that $7 over-sized beef shawarma with fries stuffed inside and the odd side item of onion rings. Food and food alone, five sexy shawarma stars."}
{"text":"This place is good, it's near my house and it helps me get my shawarma fix, but lately their take out/delivery* services have been lacking in terms of packaging. The wraps are just wrapped up terribly now, meaning the darn thing falls apart and is almost impossible to eat. What gives?   Their Greek salad with pita and tzaziki still brings me joy, though.   PEPPER'S PISSED: Seriously. If I can't eat my lunch I get pretty. Darn. Upset.   *They're one of the Just Eat lunch delivery options. I work from home. Please no judging."}
