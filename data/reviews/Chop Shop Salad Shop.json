{"text":"Excellent salad today from the Chop Shop!! The fried chicken salad was delicious and fresh. Made my first week at a new job all the better. I'll be looking for them again!"}
{"text":"I've had Chop Shop a few times, and in general, the food has been fantastic.  Fresh ingredients, well-prepared, and great combinations.  Disappointing experience today, though.  Ordered the Fried Chicken salad, and got a meager salad portion with barely an ounce of fried chicken in the whole thing.   I'll probably go back again, but seemed to be a portioning issue today that left me unhappy (and hungry)."}
{"text":"Call me biased because I work here if you want. Though as a chef who works hard at my job I put all my skills into my soups, cooking of our meats and all else. When I serve customers and they love the food I'm happy. When they say it's good I ask them what they do and don't appreciate. I listen. We believe in high quality, fresh and delicious salads and all food otherwise."}
{"text":"Tried this place out for the first time. They got my order wrong, which can happen but stuck with what I got. Large portion of greens, but only counted 5 pieces of small chicken. Could have more. I was not impressed at all with this place. I don't like my greens chopped up into tiny pieces. Makes the salad watery. I should have just walk a few more steps and went to subway for a salad. Paying $10.00 for this salad was outrageous. Will not go back"}
{"text":"Three words: The Glorious Steak.  Now, don't get me wrong, I'm vaguely sure they sell other stuff, but  this is my go-to for steak salad.   As a tooth-picking carnivore and a native Pittsburgher, I know a LOT about 100-ingredient, steak-and-french-fry salads.  That being said, I can confidently report that The Chop Shop truck makes the best salad that I've ever had that I didn't make myself.  The $12 price tag for the GS is pricey, but trust me, the bowl is loaded and is deceptively good.  The steak is PERFECT (if you like it medium like I do), but they bury the tender, tasty meat deep inside the fresh greens so you don't realize just how much meat is in there until you dig in.  The fries are on top, all crispy and salted nicely.  There's also just enough sauce on everything that you don't need extra (yay!).  Fair warning to the calorie watchers out there: it's called The Glorious Steak and has seasoned fries on top.  Move along.  To those of you with taste buds: OMFG its awesome!  Om nom nom!"}
{"text":"This is my first time trying the Chop Shop Salad truck. I purchased the Salmon Poke today and this is my first time eating this salad. The salmon was very fresh, the vegetables were crispy and extremely green. The edamame was very tender and satisfying. The price of $12 may be a little pricier than other places but was definitely well worth every penny coming from a food truck. I would purchase from the Chop Shop again and highly recommend it to others who may see it in their vicinity. Great Job, Chop Shop!!!"}
{"text":"Was told that Chop was at a nearby building and had to stop since I had heard some great accolades about the salads.  They have a list of interesting salads or you can build your own.  The menu seems to be healthy and from my salad very satisfying.  The ingredients are fresh with house made dressings.  My Piquillo Pork Chimichurri salad was delicious.  It had some panic-fried pork belly, Piquillo Pepper, Pickled Red Onion, Tomato, Cucumber, Arugula and I chose the Rustic Chimichurri dressing.   Received a small roll and butter with the salad.  Just like most salad shops, I thought a little more protein could had been in the salad but it still was a very tasty lunch."}
