{"text":"Arrived early for my flight home to Calgary with my fianc√© and her parents so we stopped here as it is the only place to get real food in this part of the airport.  Wasn't super busy so service was good and timely.  On tap beer selection was ok, but I find Ontario devoid of a really good craft beer market (compared to Calgary).  Beer arrived quickly and was nice and cold.   All meals showed up together and seemed freshly prepared.   Angus burger was good no filler in the patty and topping were fresh sadly only a small pinch of sweet potatoe fries accompanied it.  Nachos were good, but not layered very well.  My future in laws are their chicken clubs and fires with no complaints.   Al little pricey, but that's airport food for you.  Would east here again for sure."}
{"text":"Stopped for a beer here after a flight got pushed back an hour. Can't speak for the food, and the Mill St beer is good, but I can speak for the service. And it was horrible.   The waitress took our first drink order and everything seemed ok. Then she came back a while later and I ordered a second. At that point I thought the rapture happened and she was the only one taken.   After the beer never came and becoming fed up with waiting, we went up to the bar to pay and get the hell out. She gave us the bill with the never-delivered beer on it, and when we pointed out that we didn't get it, she said \"oh\" and brought back an updated receipt. I think I would have a better experience trying to make toilet wine in the Terminal 3 washroom than ever have to deal with The Distillery again."}
{"text":"Had a 3 hr layover to Vancouver. Flight left from terminal 3. Two choices for food, basic Tim Hortons( coffee doughnuts and muffins) or the Distillery. Entered into Distillery and sat at bar for close to 10 minutes. Made eye contact with waitresses with no results. Decided to see if there were other options a floor down. More Tim Hortons. Was hungry so back to the Distillery and said to hostess\" let's try this again\". Ordered a 16 oz Mill St organic Amber lager $8   Tasted like Canadian. Took almost 20 minutes for the Angus burger@ $14 with fries. Nothing to write home about.  You think the owner would staff better. Unfortunately for the time being it is the only place in the terminal for sit down food. Hopefully they get some competition soon."}
{"text":"Appalling food.  Can't believe that they charge for what they serve. Avoid the Chicken Pot Pie, containing approx 2 small pieces of actual chicken, and served with frozen peas and peculiar mashed potatoes."}
{"text":"The food was horrible, seriously, breakfast! How hard can it be, and when complained basically, oh well! I would not eat here again! I guess good news for them, I do t come to the Toronto airport very often"}
{"text":"The beer, being Mill Street, was good, albeit not worth $12 for a pint. The food, however, is another matter. I ordered the fish and chips, and although they tasted fine, I can tell the after effects of MSG and other gross chemicals (i.e., I boarded my flight with a headache, hot flushed cheeks, overall spacey feeling). This type of food should be illegal, and Mill Street should be ashamed of themselves. Service was lovely."}
{"text":"No napkins or utensils provided. Waitress disappeared. Asked the loud table behind me how things were...not me, then raced away with no eye contact. Still waiting for the bill....or utensils....chicken club sandwich was ok. Salad might have been fine if I had a fork. Food ok. Service atrocious."}
{"text":"The newest part of Terminal 3 at Pearson Airport is bereft of places to eat.  I recently had connecting flights at Pearson, and after making it through customs, rechecking my baggage and walking the 20 minutes to this section of the airport, I was left with 10 minutes before boarding to find lunch.  At this terminal there are three options for food: The Distillery has a full service restaurant, a small cooler of to-go food and there is a Tim Hortons that serves only coffee and donuts.  Alright then, Distillery to-go it is.    The food at the to-go counter is absurdly overpriced, I would have been better off buying West Jet food on the plane.  I got a turkey sandwich that rang up at over $15 with tax (no drink, chips or any sides), and it was the worst sandwich I have had in years.  The bread was soggy, the lettuce was brown, the tomato was slimy and the garlic from the spread they put on it was completely overpowering.  I choked down about half before I tossed the sandwich and decided to just eat the potato chips I had my in carry-on.  Do yourself a favor and don't bother - get food ANYWHERE else."}
