{"text":"There chicken, fries and gravy are the best and my husband can't get enough off the hot sauce you get with it. Their pizza is just okay, lacking flavour and not anything great but its our favourite fried chicken place by far!"}
{"text":"A good place to eat fried chicken. Specially their hot sauce is awesome and all my family loves it. Rest of food is just ok."}
{"text":"Normally would give them a 5 star but royally screwed up.my online order. Ordered and paid for xtra hot sauce, wasn't there..........ordered screaming hot wings, turned out to be honey garlic...........chicken was dry like it's been sitting for a bit.......time to move on?"}
{"text":"I ordered the 12pc chicken meal. Nice fast chicken and taste good too. Way better than KFC. 4 stars  For fast food I would recommend it."}
{"text":"Their food is great tasting and Halal. Its a little more expensive for a pizza place but totally worth it. Everyone that works there is super kind as well."}
{"text":"No deep fry batter on the chicken. The seasoning is awkward and I know you won't need napkins because the chicken is dry and not as satisfying as it looks. I haven't given anything else on the menu a chance because the chicken is supposed to be the hero, it's the villain."}
{"text":"Wish I could give it 5 stars but the sides are limited and dismal.  Four stars on the chicken alone! Big, juicy pieces with perfectly seasoned and crispy skin.  Loved it!  So happy to have a decent fried chicken joint close to home. I usually drive downtown to go to my favourite place (Olive Chicken), but will happily go here when I need a quick fix.  I guess I'll just have to figure out something myself to eat with the chicken. Need to find a place with biscuits, mashed potatoes and gravy, Mac n' cheese, and a decent slaw to round out this meal."}
{"text":"This is a small fast food restaurant   The meat is halal, which means the animals are slaughtered in the most ethical way possible in line with Islamic practices.  The fried chicken was moist and tasty and the pieces were big sizes. Not too salty like other fried chicken joints.  The service was great!  $36.00 with tax for 12 pieces of chicken, gravy, fries and coleslaw. $7.00 for popcorn chicken.  I recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great food everything we go and amazing customer service. Hot sauce is to die for!!! We love this place."}
