{"text":"Scott's Fire and Ice is an impressive operation.  They carry around a full size wood burning pizza oven along with a freezer in a trailer.  The Fire is for the Pizza and the Ice is for the Gelato that they will soon be selling.  Scott hauls the hardwood for the oven in his pickup truck.  The oven gets really hot.  I have enjoyed their pizza a half dozen times and it is all good - the flash cooked (3 minutes?), high heat wood oven makes the dough crispy and delicious.  My favorite is the Prosciutto and Arugula Pizza which I usually get.  I have ordered the Pepperoni and the White pizza also and they are also very good.  Order from the ladies at the side table, they make the pizzas, and Scott handles cooking.  In the summer, the poor guy has wear an ice/freeze pack around his neck to stay cool.

The pizza is so good I have wondered what it would take to put a Wood Burning pizza oven in my yard.  But then I am reminded that there needs to be a master pizza maker to get the most out of the oven.  I think I will just continue to go to Scott's.  :)"}
{"text":"We used Scott's Fire and Ice for our son's rehearsal dinner.  They were very easy to deal with even tho we were from out of town and only communicated by phone and e-mail.  The pizza's were wonderful especially the maple sausage one!!  We requested to start serving at 7:00 and the pizzas came out hot,  right at 7:00 and kept coming until we were all full!! The gelato was great of course too!  The staff was very friendly too!!"}
{"text":"Does it count as a salad if it happens to be sitting atop a pizza? One of my favorite things about hitting up the Tremont Farmers Market on summer Tuesdays is stopping by Scott's Fire and Ice for a dinnertime pizza. Their ultra-thin crust makes these surprisingly large pizzas imminently consumable without feeling like, well, you just ate a whole damn pizza. My favorite, as that first line alludes to, is the prosciutto & arugula pizza, which is topped with lots & lots of arugula & drizzled with balsamic. Eat it outside in the park & watch Tremont go by!"}
