{"text":"Hands down, authentic Pakistani cuisine at its best! Plus, it opens late and come with huge portions with a cheap price! Must try!"}
{"text":"I am always on the hunt for authentic chicken biryani, and Student Tasty Biryani has put an end to the search. Spicy chicken that melts off the bone, fluffy basmati rice with the perfect blend of yellow, orange and white grains, a hint of cilantro.   This is a small, no-frills establishment, with a very chicken-themed menu. Chicken biryani, chicken korma, chicken karahi, butter chicken, chicken tikka, chicken tikka biryani. Daal chawal is the veg option, & aloo matar keema if you like red meat. I have only had the biryani so far, but am going to eat my way through the menu and report back.   The chef and staff are incredibly friendly. And a small army of delivery boys will bring this deliciousness right to your door."}
{"text":"As much as I would love to never write a negative review because I think most people who write them are sad people with nothing else to do but complain, my love for good Indian food obligates me as a citizen of the world to spread the word.  I would like to start on a positive note, the staff was very friendly. But that's about it for the good part.  I ordered their specialty, the chicken biryani with the works. Throughout my meal I had to dodge chicken bones and raw peppercorns that were scattered in the rice, which was, in my opinion, not very flavorful and poorly seasoned. In total I counted 7 chicken bones and 9 peppercorns, averaging one of the two every 2-3 bites.  I sincerely advise you to stay away from this place and apologize for adding negative energy on the Internet, which doesn't need more than it already has."}
{"text":"The Butter Chicken and Chicken Tikka Biryani were awesome! Great for your budget, and very helpful staff. My family and I brought a big order for 8 people here, and everyone went home happy. If I were from Montreal, I'd sure be eating here again and again."}
{"text":"The food is very tasty and generously portioned. However, it's not a good value for the cost without a student discount. We had to go up and ask for the beverages that came with the combos we ordered-the clerks didn't seem very interested in customer service. The interior dining area was smoke-filled, which must have been from someone smoking in the kitchen. My biggest turn-off, though, was a sign saying their tap water is not potable, so if you want water it's $0.70 for a cup of bottled water. What kind of restaurant doesn't have potable tap water?!"}
{"text":"Best Biryani in town? Perhaps. I have tried Sana, Thali and the likes and so far, Student Tasty wins my heart. Take it from a true Desi person, the mark of my iddentity is a good ol' biryani meal. Love their Chicken Biryani; just $8 but full of flavor. It's not like the one you get home but it's as good as it gets in Montreal. My sister and I order from here often during our homesick stay-in nights. I've never visited the shop, mostly called for home delivery so no idea about ambience. But as for the Biryani, Ma'Sha Allah!"}
{"text":"I frequently order in from this place. I love their chicken biryani. Very affordable as well."}
{"text":"Place is bomb and the lunch special is such a good deal. Worth the visit!"}
{"text":"Decent biryani, very friendly staff, couple of problems:  Issues: ATM wasn't working No interac (Common we Canadians are notorious for not carrying cash, errbody knows that) Delivery takes FOREVER... Something is wrong... Place could do with better ambiance, I know it's a cheap food, but fresh tiles and better lighting go a long way  No music?! Common y'all put on some Qawwali or Coke Studio on youtube on low volume... Show off that Pakistani musiqi... Add napkins on the tables"}
{"text":"This place is open late which is probably a very good business decision. The people here were quite nice. They took our order a few minutes after closing time. I had a flavourful mango lassi that was a tad bit on the watery side but pleasant nevertheless. Alison had the vegetarian biriyani which she said was good. The chana masala was good but the naan was subpar and reminded me of terrible supermarket naan. This place should be a tad cheaper if you take the quality into consideration. All in all I would go elsewhere under the most optimal circumstances but if I happened to be around central Concordia late at night and Al-Baghdadi was again closed for some reason I probably would go once more. Try Thali a few blocks on Saint-Marc which is much better and might even be a better price."}
{"text":"As I was craving for spicy Indian food, I decided to give it a shot. I arrived there and when I got in, there were a line up of people waiting for their foods and then I placed my order. As it was my first time here I wanted to try their biryani and I saw just regular plate is $6.99 + tax and i also ordered a samosa.   My food arrived within 10 minutes and it was piping hot full with chicken and flavours and rice. I was already so happy and when I had the first bite of the chicken biryani, I was delighted as it was so delicious and hot! The portions were huge and definitely more than enough for one, you can also share it with 2 people. I was so full and happy that I came here to try it!!!  They also had other food on their menus such as thaali and other Indian dishes. The decor of this place is quite tacky but who cares? You're going for the food and to fill you up. The pakistanais biryanis were so good and I also paid attention to the other customers' food and saw how they serve a lot for the little price they charge. I'd come back for sure :)"}
{"text":"Love the place in general, good quantity of food for the price. The service is slow though most of the time food is worth waiting for. Lots of rules and directions throughout the place. Only accepts cash or debit and sometimes charges extra for using debit card."}
{"text":"I was craving authentic Pakistani cuisine (for those who are unaware, there is quite a difference between Indian/Pakistani flavours) and a friend recommended Student Tasty Biryani as it a family-run business.  We got there after 9pm and it was quite full inside, with people coming and going- the place is nothing special, it is a small basement joint with a few meal options shown as pictures on the walls and a different 'Special of the Day' which is usually around 10$. They serve on plates and seating is very basic.  Despite originally wanting to order the Biryani special (which included beef or chicken chapli kababs), we opted for the Nihari. It took a while for the Nihari to come but when it did, it was piping hot with extremely tender meat, served with naan and rice. My husband was a little disappointed as usually, Nihari is eaten with naan and not rice - they had given more rice than naan and the naan was basic, store-bought. The Nihari however, was absolutely delicious and on par with the authentic taste that I have had in the past. We also tried the STB chicken roll - spicy tandoori chicken in a butter-chicken type sauce wrapped in a fresh paratha... super cheap and super tasty! Highly recommend, even if you are just passing-by and not too hungry, grab one of these and you will be hooked! It is 3 / 4$ I believe.  The brother of the owner (who served us) was extremely friendly and passionate about the food & place. He told us the lovely story behind its opening and that there is a second branch opening soon!  Delicious authentic Pakistani cuisine, huuuuge portions & decent prices. Will definitely be back (with a bigger appetite) to enjoy the mouth-watering famous Biryani!"}
{"text":"I found plastic in my food and they charge for everything they can. It's good biryani but the plastic really threw me off. They do have vegetarian biryanis"}
{"text":"Its a hit and miss here. Been ordering quite often since last few months,its served fresh at times while some days they just microwave from previous days stuff and give it to you."}
{"text":"Best food. Excellent portions. Delivery person is so nice! Prices are great. Late night delivery is a plus. There isn't much more to say really."}
{"text":"Lovely story behind the opening of this indian \"cafeteria\".. I will spare you the details but just ask the owner or his brothers why is there a Master engineering degree on the wall behind the cash...  We had been wanting to go eat there for quiet a long time and we finally did and do not regret it .. I got carried away and did not even order a biryani but will return for it because when i saw the portions i fell of my chair ' they are huge  This time around I ordered a Nihari which came with rice and naan .. Personally nihari is not something i usually eat with rice at all give me 3 naan but not a bowl a rice lol !  We also ordered chicken rolls, they were lovely its bbqd chicken very moist juicy and well seasoned:)  I will go back to try out their speciality : biryani"}
{"text":"Average Biriyani at an average price.  They only accept cash or interac,  sketchy in that aspect. Customer service is generally prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"This place is accurately named. It is the best place to go when you are a student and on a budget and want to eat a real portion of food. If you get the Special (which is from noon to 3pm if I remember correctly) it will be enough food to feed you for lunch, I got full before finishing the entire container. It is really cheap, I forget if it was like $5 or $6, but it is definitely your money's worth. I went and also ordered Ã  la carte, just to try it out, the butter chicken and rice with a beverage, it was $7.99. They also have a good deal for two mango lassis, I think one goes for $2.99 and two for $3.99, but if you feel adventurous, they also have a variety of bottled drinks: Lychee and Basil seeds or Mango and Basil seeds, those looked amazing and I didn't get to try them yet. Definitely will on my next visit!"}
{"text":"Our first time there, we ordered chicken biryani \"up-sized\" , wow that was really a big plate of biryani.  They have various other options to choose from, but I have never tried anything else other than chicken biryani. Biryani tastes  good. Quite a few times we had chicken biryani to go, I must say they have maintained the consistency with the taste.  Worth trying it if you are a biryani fan."}
{"text":"Visited this place twice during my 5 day work visit to montreal.  The first time I ordered a Achari chicken combo ( Achari chicken curry , Naan and Rice) and I substituted the rice with biryani rice. It's was amazing. Everything was fresh and good portion. The staff is friendly and helpful. I guess biryani is the most popular as all the tables were full and everyone was eating biryani. I give this place a 5 for the taste and quality of food. If you are looking for tasty food go for it. If u are looking for fine dine and etc go somewhere else.  This place is not at all expensive"}
{"text":"My Pakistani friends swear by their Biryani, as do I. Portions are huge and affordable (although prices have gone up since they first opened). I've only ever gotten it delivered and it can sometimes be iffy, but it's always worth it. Tip: you can ask for it extra spicy for an extra kick, but it'll always be flavorful enough even if you forget!!"}
{"text":"One of the tastiest Biryani . Every time I eat here, I get reminded of the taste which my mom prepares. I bought my friend who is a vegetarian and he loved this place."}
