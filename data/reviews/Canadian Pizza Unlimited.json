{"text":"This place rules, even though I get sick 50% of the time, it's a good pie. If it's dirty as hell come back another time, if it's clean, the pizza probably is too."}
{"text":"The first time I ordered delivery it took 3 hours 2nd time it took over an hour with two inauthentic quote  times of 5 mins but still took over 39 mins to arrive when it is a 5 min drive.   The ppl that worked there talked to me rudely over the phone when I asked what they were going to do for me.  As someone that works in the industry this is ridiculous.  The pat quote time was \"on the way\". That was another 10 mins ago.   When the pizza finally arrived it was the wrong size.  His driver called the store and he told me I didn't have to pay but he proceeded to yell at me on the phone how since I'm industry     I should understand how things go wrong....  Are you for real."}
{"text":"Somehow or other Calgarians have mistaken toasted mozzarella sandwiches for pizza. If you have enjoyed great pizza, the kind served in Lower East Side New York, the North End of Boston, St. Clair Avenue in Toronto, Napoli etc. you are fully aware of what I am talking about.  The sign of a good pizza is not how many toppings you can pile on and how much cheese you can bury them in afterwards. How such pizza [sic] usurped a delicate crust with light cheese and moderate toppings all on top of the cheese puzzles me. Ooey Gooey Good is just not real pizza.  For the first time in several years today, I ordered a pizza from CPU and I was quite disappointed. There was so much cheese that you could taste nothing else and the weight of it caused the crust to keel over and all the toppings to fall off. Some truly like this style of so-called pizza but I truly believe it should be renamed an open faced mozzarella and pepperoni sandwich.  However, if you like to substitute quantity for quality, and pile the toppings on like no tomorrow, CPU will not disappoint you. If you like real Italian pizza, unfortunately you will have to seek an alternative."}
{"text":"Crust is just okay, and topping ratio is pretty standard for Calgary. But at $3 each, it's the place to go if a slice is what you're looking for. Hawaiian isn't my favorite usually, but this is always their freshest tasting per-slice offering. Note that they have hot sauce for you to put on the pizza, which is a combo I'm becoming quite the fan of.  FYI, if you order a proper full pizza, it's competitively priced, and as the name suggests there is no limit on the number of toppings you can put on.  And they don't mind if you end most of your sentences with prepositions."}
{"text":"I HATE THIS LOCATION!!!  for the past 5 times i've ordered from this location they have NOT put TOMATOES on my pizza. everytime i specify tomatoes, how hard is it to remember your FOUR toppings?!?!?! it's like a goddamn conspiracy.  the last time i ordered they put CHICKEN (!!!) on my vegetarian pizza. when i called to complain the guy who answered the phone said he had made the order himself and there was no error. he essentially called me a liar and refused a refund or an exchange. i am NEVER ordering from this location again...they can't get anything right.   so when you order make sure you enunciate...not that it mattered when i did. mmmmmmmmhmmmmmmmmmmmmmm. -laquisha"}
{"text":"Best pizza place in Calgary, this one is located in Cranston, where I live, they put everything on Â pizza, their donair is nice, and I love their chicken wings. Its also all Halal, and that is better for me. Every time a friend of mine who doesn't come here tries it, they have to compliment how amazing the crust is. Then they go on and tell me about how awesome the toppings are, or how the cheese isn't bland. The chicken wings are amazing, some of the best I've tasted. However the unlimited toppings are why you should come here, they have amazing black olives, their beef is great and I've yet to try all the other things they serve. Pizza is ready in 15 minutes, then you will be presented with an amazing bill, the price of some of the things you can get here for about 20 would cost over 30 dollars anywhere else! Come to this place when you need a pizza, I don't know about service in other branches, but here in Cranston, This is undisputably 5 stars. However one thing I don't like is there barbeque chicken.    P.S. this is my favorite pizza place so if I seem biased I need to say my reasons for liking this place is location, price and menu."}
{"text":"I stopped here one day because it's on my way home home from work and I was starving, and I've been hooked ever since. Whether it's by the slice or a whole pie,  this pizza is totally awesome. Last time I was there I made up my own pie. It's reasonably priced and the ingredients are always fresh. Plus they're super fast, what else can you ask for in pizza?"}
{"text":"Born and raised in New York, I know pizza! I have tried soooo many places here in Calgary and I am pretty disappointed every time. This place is the only place that I keep going back to. They actually make a really good pizza. The crust is great, the toppings are great. They really nailed it. I really like the donair pizza. Yum! Give this place a try, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I ordered two pizzas from here today for delivery. I was told 30-40 min as is standard.  After 50min I called back and asked where my delivery was, and I was told the driver left 25min ago. I live about 0.5km away according to google. The person on the phone told be to wait 5-10min more. After 1hr and 40 min total the delivery driver showed up, and I refused to pay, so he left. Can't comment on the food quality but the service sucks."}
{"text":"Horrible. Had it for the first time last night because my husband suggested it. He had it a few days ago at work and said it was great. Unfortunately the pizza we had was horrible and gave us both food poisoning.  we will order from a different place from now on"}
{"text":"Typical fast food small pizza by slice one man operation. Good thick dough pizza (and quite large slices for 3$) lots of toppings and guy that works there was friendly. We ate pepperoni and Hawaiian, both were just as we hoped they are."}
{"text":"WHY am I the first one reviewing this Canadian Pizza Unlimited? This place, ladies and gentlemen, is one of THE most popular places in Kensington!  Serving Pizza by the slice at insanely affordable prices, this place is usually packed.  Here's what you can get for your hard earned deniro:  Huge Slice of Pizza + Pop = $3.50 2 Huge Slices of Pizza + Pop = $6 1 Huge Slice of Pizza = $3  Hella cheap eh? Told ya so."}
{"text":"Favourite pizza place in town. I go almost everyday. Owner is friendly and is a family run store.   They have unlimited toppings with decent prices and also have large slices for $3 in Pepperoni and Hawaiian, Cans of pop for a dollar and just a great place to go for a quick lunch or dinner.   They have Skip the Dishes and Uber Eats if you prefer to sit back and let the food come to you."}
{"text":"I recently placed an order online for One extra large pizza and some wings and the website said my Order was confirmed and would take 40-45 minutes and after about an hour I decided to call to see what was happening because no pizza came and I didn't receive any call. The person who answered said he hasn't made my order because no one told him from the day shift the Order was placed! He saw the order on the computer but since he wasn't told he didn't make the pizza. This is horrible service and I will never be ordering from this location again, overall very shitty experience"}
{"text":"I dunno WHY, but I woke up the other day with a MAD craving for pizza. And I didn't just want a bit of it, I wanted the whole damn pie.   I came across this location of CPU and couldn't resist the urge. Ordered an extra large pizza (for less than it costs to go see a movie) and it was heaven to my taste buds.   The guy workin' the counter was a sweetheart and he hooked me up with extra toppings.   I have yet to have a bad CPU experience - Someone quick, KNOCK ON WOOD!"}
{"text":"Just having moved here from Ontario, I was unfamiliar with this pizza chain. 1 single slice in Calgary got me hooked for a time. I have not found better pizza in Calgary to date unless you count a pretty good new thin frozen pizza from McCain.... I am so lucky I have this place down the street from where I live! I would not say you get a smile with service no matter how friendly you are - maybe the delivery guys are different. Won't stop me from going back! I like the tanginess of the sauce, the crispy, fresh tasting crust, the fresh toppings per slice and the cheese that is REAL not goop and satisfying to the last bite. I can finish a whole slice - but barely! BUT, sigh this is a chain and I know I can do better...  I am still after a place that rocks my pizza needing world - anyone... anyone... I miss a good slice. :("}
{"text":"I accidentally called this pizza place by accident. I googled my usual place and mistyped the name. I never noticed and I just hit the connect button. Boy what a satisfying mistake that was. The pizza was extremely tasty. Not only were the toppings generous but not super salty. I love pizza but hate that I have to drink a gallon of water at night. This place I actually never had to. We ordered it a second time and I believe we have found our new spot!!"}
{"text":"Queensland's hidden gem, CPU has always been a reliable place for a single slice pizza or a full pizza order. The shop is very minimal. Every time I come here I feel like a character off Spike Lee's \"Do the Right Thing\" but instead of racial tensions the guys at CPU always greet me with \"what can I do for you today my friend?\".   No fancy dining room or waiting service. Just a counter/till for you to place your order. They offer several sizes pizza and do not bother with the listing various combinations with appropriate names like \"Mediterranean pizza\" or \"meatlovers\". Just look at the list of available toppings and make your own pizza of madness. I always order a thin crust with all the various kinds of cheese (including feta and goat) with peppers. I call this \"Buzz's revenge\" (RE: Home Alone)  My only criticism is that sometimes when I buy their single slices I get a derelict piece that has been left out for hours. But if I am willing to wait, they will usually make me a fresh piece with no arguments or hassle whatsoever."}
{"text":"Well, it's fast, it's cheap, and it's bigish. In all honesty, when you just want a big slab of cheese and sauce topped with plain-Jane pepperoni, (plus a pop) this will fill the bill in fine fashion. BUT, sometimes it's the small things that undermine it: like the cheese doesn't go all the way out to the crust; sometimes it's oldish or not warmish; sometimes the crust is too thick etc. Consistency counts for a lot in my books; it demonstrates pride and caring. Plus the ingredients aren't bad, but they're also nothing special. But by all means hit up CPU when you're close by and need a quick fix for lunch!!"}
{"text":"Hungry and only want to spend $3 to deal with it? Canadian Pizza Unlimited is going to be your go to! The pizza isn't anything to write home about, which I never do anyway because sending my Yelp reviews to my mother isn't going to help anyone. I'm sure she'd appreciate me keeping in touch all the same, but I digress... What's the best kind of pizza? I usually just take a look at the rack and try determine which looks the most fresh. If you're open to most of your standard pep, cheese, Hawaiian pizzas, I suggest you do the same.   KENSINGTON FOOD HACK: 1 piece isn't quite enough. 2 pieces is too much. Order one piece and then get a single taco from El Charrito for $2.25 to wash it down. Perfect size meal for $5.25.  I've never ordered a pizza from here because if I'm thinking ahead enough to order a pie, I usually want to go with something of a little higher quality. But if you've got a party to feed or a birthday with a bunch of rugrats, call them up! You can get unlimited toppings at no extra charge. Unlimited. Just you try to not take advantage of that after you and your bros have crush a 24 of Pils."}
{"text":"Unlimited toppings! Just none of them ever seem to be that good... It's definitely edible though, mind you. I'd say it even borders on 'kinda decent' and you get a lot of it for the price!   If it's ridiculously late, and you need some za' delivered, especially if you've been drinking, CPU will be a solid choice for you. I sort of relate it to being like a slightly better Little Caesars Pizza, without all the marketing budget that Lil C's has for being such a massive chain.   It's basically a pizza kitchen with enough of a storefront so they can take your order and your money. It's mostly a takeout spot, but there's a slight bar counter so you can hang out for a few while you scarf back a few slices.   I was there early afternoon on a Saturday, so there wasn't much for fresh Pizza by the Slice options. However, they still had a few pieces and while not quite hot out of the oven, they weren't yet on their way to looking sad and old."}
{"text":"Great choice, budget friendly! Their 6$ special for lunch is terrific and 13$ for a huge pizza with unlimited toppings. Totally recommended"}
{"text":"Not even worth one star. Sad cause the dough is alright here. Too bad it gives u the shits. Somebody doesn't wash their hands. Three times I've eaten there all ended badly :( no stars for you if I could"}
{"text":"I've never had an issue with pizza from here.  It's relatively fresh and fills the empty stomach.  Today had a slice of pepperoni and mushroom.  Crust was delicious, pepperoni had a bit of a kick, and not too greasy."}
{"text":"CPU isn't my favourite pizza, but it is decent and filling and open late. Really, really late. Back in my Uni days when I (wasn't) cramming for exams late, I would get really hungry around the early morning. It was always just as we ran out of snack food.  Enter CPU:  big slices, decent amount of toppings, decent staff, and close by. I'd run on over and get cheesy bread, which they always made fast and quick, or a couple slices of pepperoni to carry my brain through 'til morning. And it was nice to see a friendly face after the cold, boring face of a lot my textbooks!"}
{"text":"My friend and I got food poisoning from this location on 17th. Plus a friend told me he got food poisoning at the one 10th ave near the Macs recently too. I highly recommend you get your pizza, wings, etc some where else. Unless you wanna puke like 10 times thoughout the night."}
{"text":"This place makes a bomb a$$ pizza. $3 for a slice. $6 for 2 slices and a can of pop! On nights when we're too lazy to cook we just pick up a few slices. My son loves their pepperoni pizza and the fact that they layer the pepperoni under the cheese makes it so much easier for him to eat! Great value for a tasty easy meal!"}
{"text":"Their hit & ready pizza is awesome and inexpensive at lunch time. Apparently the price goes up for the drinking crowd at night."}
{"text":"This pizzeria is a favorite hidden gem of mine, located in beautiful bridgeland and only a short walk from my house on edmonton trail. Conveniently located beside a liquor store and a gas station, this CPU is usually full of colourful local bridgeland characters. Walking  Inside you are assaulted by the aroma of fresh baked gourmet pizza, served to you by authentic italian men, some of whom i have become close friends with. My favorite is usually the beef and mushroom, but sometimes you can find yourself stuck with an only an old heatlamp piece of vegetarian, due to the high volume of customers this establishment recieves. Wait 10 minutes or so though and you can have your choice of any kind you wish. Good food, good friends, bridgeland CPU everybody!"}
{"text":"This may not be the best pizza, but it is certainly great for fast, quick, and cheap. I only hit this location up if I'm stumbling out of an Electric Ave bar (old school right?) or find myself downtown at lunch time. Although it's not top quality, 2 pieces and a pop for $6 is a wicked deal.  23/30"}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza from this place and was told it would be 40-45 mins. that was not the case. After one hour, i called and they said the driver would be right there. The pizza arrived an hour and 23 minutes later. The pizza was warm at best, but took it anyways as my family was hungry and if was getting late. I called them back to tell them about my expierence, and the very rude person on the phone began making excuses about the barely warm pizza, and said i shouldn't have taken then. I guess the alternative was to wait another hour and 23 mins for another pizza???!!!??? he offered another pizza, but  i declined as we decided just to heat it in the oven and make due with what we had. Then the pizza company called back and said we have to take the pizza he offered as a replacement as he has already put it in the oven......WTH!!! I declined and as I was going to hang up, he started arguing with me saying that I didn't call when I said I did and that the pizza arrived on time......um ok crazy pizza guy. I hung up on him and warmed up my, cold, below sub par, pizza. I would NOT get pizza from this company ever again. Poor service, poor quality.....never EVER again"}
{"text":"Cheap, fast and ooey, gooey, cheesy good! When you need pizza late at night, need it delivered and fast this is your place! It was at my door within 25 minutes of ordering it, the crust was fantastic the cheese was great and it was piled high with toppings. I can't complain about one thing and would definitely order this pizza at next time I am in need of some late night za."}
{"text":"CPU is a great late night pizza place.  If you're just leaving a bar and you're feeling really hungry, grab a slice of pizza at CPU with the leftover pocket change you have.  The pizza is cheap, and it's always ready when you are.  Late night cravings are really the only thing that would send me over to CPU.  The pizza sure hits the spot at 1:00am, but wouldn't satisfy my appetite during lunch or dinner hours.  If I wanted pizza during peak hours, I would probably try to find a different joint, perhaps with a little more sustenance.  When I'm leaving the bar after a night of drinking and dancing, pizza is definitely something I crave, and CPU is sure to hit the spot.  Ah, drunken pizza eating... my favourite!"}
{"text":"Great price, quick service.  Nothing you wouldn't expect from a pizza joint, but you get exactly what you order :)"}
{"text":"The only worthwhile pizza-by-the-slice place I've found in Calgary. Just-short of great pizza at truly great prices ($3 slices!), with incredibly generous portions.  Pretty much take-out only, though there is a shelf-table along the window."}
{"text":"Good pizza place but not great. The place is very small with only a couple of seats if you wish to dine in. The staff is friendly and service is quick.   The pizzas are nothing special, so when I visit the place, or any pizza place for that matter I always ask if there's something coming out of the oven. It's always best to get pizza when it's hot and fresh rather than to grab something that's been on display for an unknown amount of time.   If there's nothing coming out I usually order a small 8\" or so pizza and they'll make it on the spot in about 15 mins.   This place is good if you're in the area craving for a quick bite to eat, but nothing worth traveling across the city for"}
{"text":"Ugh. CPU. No, that's not fair! I love CPU. There are times when it just hits the spot ... and the value is pretty decent.  But it is not the best quality. The selection of toppings looks amazing, but I have a hard time distinguishing flavours with each bite. It seems like one big blehhhhh. No, no! ... again, that's not fair. It's not, \"blehhh\" ... I mean ...  It's good! ... it's just ... not very exciting.  I love you, CPU. But I hate you. ... but I love you."}
