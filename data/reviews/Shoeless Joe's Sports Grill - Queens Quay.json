{"text":"The food at this location was good. Got a bite of Pulled Pork sandwich from my wife. It was actually pretty good.
I ordered chicken wings, breaded, they weren't the best, especially at $10 per 8 wings. I expected large wings for that price, instead it was just your normal size, even breaded I thought they should've looked bigger. I thought I would have gotten big bird U.S.A style wings. 
Very poor menu. 
I had a hard time finding something to choose. The reason why we went to this restaurant was because we were at a Shoeless Joes in Welland. The menu there was great. $10 menu and a normal menu, you had a good set of choices , unlike this location which was very poor. 
The pulled pork get 3 stars. 
The wings get 1 star for size and price. 
0 for the menu also."}
{"text":"Nothing special here though you can at least get a pint of Guinness.  The buffalo chicken pizza was OK but nothing I would recommend.  Prices are high as expected on the waterfront.  Not a bad place to watch a game though."}
{"text":"It took over an hour to get our food and the waitress didn't even get my order right!! It was super busy (a holiday) but waiting 40 minutes for a table and over an hour for food is unreasonable. At least when we got our bill they didn't charge us for one of the drinks.
Probably won't go back there again."}
{"text":"Just your typical bar, wish they had more TVs in the bar area, food was so so."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, the service here it's not the same as others Shoeless Joe. I came with some friends, the place was not busy but still we had to wait so long to order because waitress was not paying attention to the tables."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic but the crowd is off. Always the same guys there getting hammered and filling the bar area. Lots of TVs for sporting events and the service was above average."}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday night, that wasn't that busy - I'm assuming because everyone had already heard about the slow service, haha. Waited over a half hour for our food (a couple of sandwiches & an order of wings), without our server checking on us even once to let us know it would be late. Thankfully, the food was good (but my fries were a bit undercooked). But we're never going there again or recommending that location."}
{"text":"My experience here was probably the worst I've had in a while. We came here to grab some dinner by lakeshore, and right when we walked in, we were already introduced with terrible service. The hostess seemed impatient and unreasonably frustrated over every question. We should've walked out by then, but we decided to stay, which was our worst decision that night. The food was dry, bland, and nowhere close to being worth its price, they forgot to bring me a glass of water (I thought bringing water to start customers off was common etiquette?), and the service was just disgusting and pitiful. There are so many great places to eat in Toronto - so do yourself a favour and do not settle for this one."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed this place. Let me preface this by saying that I was exhausted from standing in line at the CM Tower for about 2.5 hours after we had went to the Blue Jays game and I was extremely tired and hungry. On the way back to the truck we saw this restaurant and I made an executive decision to get something to eat. The place was not crowded and the atmosphere was alive, but not loud. There were plenty of TVs to watch whatever sport is on that day. Luckily for us, it was rugby. I have no clue as to what the rules are of this sport, but it was interesting to watch nonetheless. Our waitress was extremely nice and somehow was able to pick out that we weren't from Canada (pretty obvious we are from Texas). She made her recommendations and was very accommodating. My wife ordered the Caesar Salad, my cousin ordered the mini sliders and I ordered the Korean Duck Wings. The sliders came with some fried onion strings that were delicious and, in my opinion, should have came with more of them. My wife said the Caesar Salad was very good, though the chicken was a little dry. My Korean duck wings were delicious. It had a semi spicy sauce drizzled on to it and had chopped green onions on top. It came with 6 and I ordered a side of fries with it. The fries weren't anything special, but did the trick as to what I wanted. If it were possible I would rate this place a 4.5 as I really liked the food. I would recommend this restaurant and would visit another Shoeless Joe's restaurant based on my experience at this one"}
{"text":"Been waiting for my food for an hour... Seriously ? Been seated for 15minutes before anyone even acknowledge us or even ask for drinks. At least update us where is our food. Management at SJ should seriously look into their staffing for their kitchen if you're hoping to serve a downtown traffic. Why are all SJ slow at serving their food. Menu and drink menu is not bad, but definitely so disappointed."}
{"text":"My friends and I went down to watch the UFC and grab some food. We had the Nachos, Wings, and Burgers. Best tasting was the cracked peppercorn burger. 

On the plus side...Service was friendly . 

Too bad the food was so mediocre. I really think they could bump it up a notch or maybe they are forced to follow a corporate menu.

Lots of TV though to watch the fights."}
{"text":"My family and I came to SJ after an Iron Maiden concert that came this weekend. We waited at least 30 minutes for 4 of our drinks. Our food took about an hour to get to us. We had the Lumberjack burger, and 2 classic burgers and all burgers were so dry and tasted burnt, the portion size for the fries were small, soggy and cold. I ordered the honey garlic wings and instead they gave me hot sauce on the wings, it tasted like Frank's hot sauce. When I asked for it to be redone, she said it would take another 15 minutes to cook them. So instead I got the chicken strips with honey garlic on them. We payed $85 dollars for this disgusting meal. The only good part were the drinks. The staff are also unfriendly and just suck. I would not recommend this place to anyone. Save your money and go to Amsterdam BrewHouse, it was fantastic and worth it"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of chain/franchise restaurants and don't make them my usual haunts. Sometimes, the location dictates your choices, and in this area of the city it is hard to come by a decent place to sit down for beer and a casual pub meal. Much of what's around it is fast food, and aside from a few expensive exceptions it isn't great restaurant territory along this waterfront area. There are other places, to be sure, but many are swollen full with tourists and sun-seekers in the summer high season and are locked down and/or dull in the off seasons.

This particular Shoeless Joe's is worth noting, however, judged against the standard of sister locations and other comparable places. If you're looking for fine dining service and/or gourmet cuisine, stop reading and move on.

If you're looking for a casual place with lots of sports on TV and a decent bite to eat, you're going to find it here. Clean, comfortable and with lots of TVs in every direction, this is a good place to quaff an ale and catch a game anytime. It's also got good food for a Shoeless Joe's, and their menu is as complete by that kind of playbook as one could ever expect. 

The real secret to this joint is that there are a few consistent specials that never appear on the menu but that are always worth ordering. We visited the week it opened and our server told us the owners also run a family place in Brampton, an Indian restaurant. Just about every time I dine at this location, I order the Chicken Masala or Butter Chicken which are made from the family restaurant's recipes. They are always good, and are served with a side of rice and naan - I usually hold the rice and double down on the naan.

I visit the area often, on my way to and from Toronto Island, and this place has become a regular stop for me when I want to grab something along the shore."}
{"text":"Jason M below is probably a staff here since he's smoking some next shit.

This establishment is an embarrassment to the Queen's Quay BIA.  Food is below par, ordered fish and chip, it came BLACK.  I told the waitress this is a way overcooked and her reply was \"really? It's like that.\" ... not my first rodeo at F&C.

Service clearly is also crap.  Took the server 10 min to bring water and another 15 min to come back, in fact I had to ask to order.  The manager on duty must have been in a fowl mood that night because she didn't even apologize for the burnt food and just came back with a new one.  No apology, no smiles, same your money and go somewhere else.  Must be a reason why they have less than 3 stars.

Wonder when their lease is up, going to BIA to request their removal."}
{"text":"Pretty standard sports bar chain with all of the usual pub grub. It's a good place to grab a beer and watch sports but don't expect an impressive selection of craft taps or anything fancy on the menu."}
{"text":"Ate here last night. Excellent service from a beautiful buxom waitress!  Terrific French onion soup, Greek salad and cheeseburger!  Loved my time here!"}
{"text":"TL;DR
Perfect location for cold food, rude service, and then a pathetic attempt to save the dinner service with excuses.

If it wasn't the hour or longer wait, or the incorrect orders, maybe you'll be thrilled by the service that was not existent. Let me tell you a story about one bad experience after the other.

7:45pm arrival.
Ordered water and a couple drinks, came in a decent time. Not fast or slow.
then we put in our orders for an app and four main courses.
Appetizer was a little slow to get to us, but hey, every kitchen forgets an order or two. Probably came about a half hour after ordering it.

9:00pm still hungry.
Maybe our orders got mixed up and they were trying to get all of them out at the same time, that seems right doesn't it? Although we did start to wonder about why the waitress didn't write down our orders, but we gave her the benefit of the doubt.

9:05pm is our food ready?
Yes we actually had to ask! We were replied to a with a rushed almost annoyed tone. This is when we start being purposefully ignored.

9:10pm Yay two meals arrive!
Oh wait one of the orders is wrong. Okay we'll just let them know. Comes back, still wrong... Really? Wow.

9:20pm all our meals arrive.
And the order that was wrong... still wrong. But wait there's more! Another one of the other orders was wrong. Guess she should have written some of it down. But hey it's okay as long as the food that did arrive was lukewarm at best or cold, fresh out of the fridge. (I do know some food is prepped in advance, but it's nice when it doesn't taste that way)

9:30pm Only one order left that is incorrect.
We all finish with our main courses, except for the last one that still has a part of it left to come. Not sure if it's ironic that it was the warmest of all the hot food.

10:00pm got our checks.
Jesus how long have we been here? The restaurant is only half full, on a Friday, well not surprising. Oh and you think there'd be an apology in there somewhere. Well there is, at the end, when the checks come, coincidence? Was it a genuine apology, could have been if it wasn't for the pity excuses that followed. Oh but where was the kitchen manager during all of this?

I won't say not to eat here, you can read my experience and decide for yourself if this is how you want to spend your money."}
{"text":"Typical casual dining place where one goes to watch a sports game. I found the service pretty good and my Wild Mushroom Truffle Burger was surprisingly tasty. However, the server got two of my friends orders wrong. It took awhile to rectify the situation. When they did receive their correct orders, they tasted mediocre. The server issued a discount, but I do not think it will be enough to persuade my friends to go back again.

To be safe, stick with the Wild Mushroom Truffle Burger."}
{"text":"Go to this location of Shoeless Joe's. The wait staff are nice and the menu is good with very reasonably priced and varied menu options. For a casual meal with a friend or a group, I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Lord I hope the owner reads this -
Im here on biz and your location is great for Radisson Guests when the weather is bad which it was during my stay.

Every time I visited  this place no one was eating and I now know why - To start make sure you bring some OFF as Little Bugs are flying around the bar. Had gone 3x and the food is so off. One Meal I got spoiled lettuce on a wrap and it tasted so wrong (sent it back after showing the bartender). One bite was more then enough to taste the rotten lettuce ---very unhappy!! 
Burgers are is less then tasty - my  french fries werent cooked right - ordered well done  ( dont eat the gravy that comes with it - its canned) 
Fish Tacos are a  bummer.... salsa was watery and could not figure out what was in it.

Also see you have a celebrity chef menu. Not sure why any chef would want you to put out food with their name. The person next to me tried one of the celebrity meals and his girl friend wouldnt eat it......he the offered me some --was good for a laugh.

Yes this is a tough yelp but suck it up and fix it if you care about your customers health!!

Positive is your staff -- great ... pleasant .. pros......bar staff could clean the bar better to get rid of flys"}
{"text":"We stopped here after a blue jays game. The TVs at every table let us finish watching the game. The food was decent. But the atmosphere, music and staff made me enjoy that we even made the stop. Would go again."}
{"text":"We were walking around after a Raptor's game, looking for a place to get a beer and something to eat. We walked past Shoeless Joe's and decided to go in. The place was packed (in a good way) and it was so lively. There was football on the tv's, and I think they had some type of draw going on. The burger was delicious!!!! We had an amazing time and I will definitely come back next time I'm in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Hi Just visited this place again on the last UFC event. I guess they heard me and now the fights are shown in the full HD glory (correction the last event here  UFC 135 was not in HD so I wonder what happened). Not to mention they have revamped menu (I just tried the Onion rings which were good) I guess I will report and update more after another visit. Had a followup visit here for UFC 134 after an unfortunate try at another pub which ended me leaving that place half way.This place was packed and was full of UFC enthusiastic crowd. I wish they had more imports but nevertheless the crowd made up for it. Even had a betting ring for drinks going on for outcome of fights among the crowd. Needless to say this place has somewhat redeemed itself. I tried the Wings with Franks red hot sauce. Not half as bad as they used to be. Service was better than the last visit. I would go as far as giving this place recommendation to watch UFC."}
{"text":"Right now it is 6:01 pm and we arrived at 4:45. We are really hungry. The arrival of food does not seem promising. Not a place to go after the Jays game. 

You have been forewarned.

Day 2, 6:07 pm. Talked to the manager who offered free pitcher and fries. Maybe getting better?

Day 3, 6:35 pm. Free fries never came. My food arrived 15 minutes after everyone else received theirs. Spoke with manager who offer to have the meal on the house. Good gesture. 

End of the day, I would choose another venue."}
{"text":"I go here often with my partner. We've been here for the superbowl party which was friggin awesome! I bought pairs of tickets for us and my parents. My parents had the time of their lives! Free beer, a dinner buffet (where do you find a buffet during superbowl?!?!?!), followed by a nacho buffet, and then draws for a fridge, 42\" tv, and then a $25 gift cert. It was epic all for $40 bucks a ticket. 

Aside from that, we are here regularly throughout the week for dinner. The sandwiche/burgers are all killer. 

The service is pretty good. The waitress who told us about the superbowl tickets is very cool and is a fixture there. The other waitresses are usually pretty cool. The hostesses can be pretty dead to the world, but I can't blame them. Seems like a boring job. The tv's are always playing some kind of sport. If you want, you can ask to have the channel changed. Also good for a post-skate beer from the outdoor Natrel rink.

My fav: Tuesday night cheap burgers. Hell ya."}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst restaurants in Toronto I have been to. The staff was pretty rude and unprofessional while the food was cold/hard/dry. I don't think I would come here even if I was given a free meal.

Pros:
- Near Lake shore

Cons:
- The food was bad. I ordered a burger with fries and a beer. When the food came, the burger was dry and did not have the same ingredients as to what the menu said it had. The fries were on the colder side and hard to chew.
- Hostess was very rude. Whenever I asked her a question, she seemed impatient and tired of my 2 questions.
- Waiters/waitresses dropped plates, cutlery and cups on the floor every 15 minutes and would just laugh at or kick the ice cubes around.
- Took a long time for the waiter to bring my beer or food. They forgot to bring my girlfriend a cup of water and when she asked for it, they took another 10 minutes to bring it. I could've walked to the convenience store and got it faster than they did."}
{"text":"We went to this place on a Sunday afternoon without anything in mind. Since I'm the opposite of many Yelpers in the sense that I usually like chain restaurants like Keg, Red Lobster, Pickle Barrel and such, it seemed like a good choice. When we entered the room it kinda put me off a little bit, don't know if it was because it had just a few people eating alone... but we were greeted by a very good server. The food was good and cheap. We had the delicious Lobster Fettuccine. The desserts, however, looked best in the menu than in person: the funnel cake didn't seem fresh and the \"Belgian melter\" was a rip-off (this is not completely their fault, though, because we ordered by the picture only, forgetting to read what it was exactly). They ran out of the dessert that we'd really like to order - the one with cheesecake bits. All in all, that's the kind of place I like: good, cheap food and good service. Can't wait to try their burgers."}
{"text":"We came because it was close to where we were staying.  Our expectations were modest.  The food and service were both solid.  Portions were large and menu had many choices.  The place was clean.  Not a bad choice to see a game or get a bite to eat."}
{"text":"This place is convenient to go to because it's in the same building as the hotel I'm staying in.

Being from California and not use to the cold weather here, I don't really want to venture too far from my hotel for a bite to eat after working all day.

I've had the goat cheese pizza here which was good. I had the butter chicken which was flavorful, but I wish they used white chicken meat."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner after a long day, we had a group of eight split up between two tables and can I say big regret. Multiple food orders came out incorrect which they quickly got to fixing. The fried treated like they had been sitting out for sometime.

The three cheese steak was horrible, and a big regret for me. The side of fries portion was tiny. 

They gave me a 25% discount because of all the issues but would not go there for a meal again.

For drinks, probably but very doubtful I'll ever eat food there again"}
{"text":"My friends and I were walking around near this area and I had never had Shoeless Joe's so we walked in to try the food. It wasn't too busy so we were able to get a table fairly quickly. We order nachos which were the best nachos I have ever heard. Even the single is more than enough among two-three people. After the nachos we wanted some dessert. We ended up get caramel pretzel bits which were really good, I thought they would be too sweet but they were actually good. With the icing they have that comes with it, it was prefect. I didn't get a chance to try something from the mains but I will definitely come back to try more. Overall had a good experience."}
{"text":"Visited today for lunch. Ordered the 3 Cheese burger. The meat was cold when it arrived. Server was good at the table, so don't know where the problem was. They didn't look busy."}
{"text":"bland food, meh setting. This is a just a tourist trap serving tasteless food. Avoid."}
{"text":"NEVER EVER COME HERE. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GO ELSEWHERE.

Myself and a group of three arrived at this restaurant at 7:45pm. We were served by Courtney. Restaurant was half full.

We got our orders in and it took a long time for our friends to get their wine. They got their appetizer the same time as their wine (which in fact took a while to get).

We waited more than an hour to get our food which is far beyond unreasonable. Absolutely outrageous. Only two of the dishes arrived. They got my order wrong, sent it back, came back wrong AGAIN, I made sure she didn't take it back because she would only mess it up for the rest of the night. Courtney never apologized for any of the food being late or getting our orders wrong. Only mentioned that she was, \"having the worst night of her life\".

The rest of the group had poor meals. One of us asked for yam fries and got regular lukewarm soggy french fries instead. When she got her yam fries and asked about a dip, we were told that she was going to be charged for the dip. And the dip was terrible.

When our bills came Courtney tried to get tips from us by apologizing only when we were paying for our bills. She also complained about a rash that she had and showed it to us. How unprofessional and inappropriate for a dining establishment.

Save your money, go elsewhere. You'll probably grow old once you get your food."}
{"text":"Gluten free option flat bread was great! Service was prompt as well. Food was out in 20 mins."}
{"text":"Came to this location before a concert at the Rogers centre. We informed them we had a show to get to so the service was prompt and speedy. The food and drinks were all mediocre pub style food. Nothing special but none the less, we were full and didn't have to pay $20 for junk food at Rogers!!"}
{"text":"Came here out of desperation for a quick, close dinner. Typical sports bar. TVs everywhere.
We were sat promptly, ordered drinks and food, but never received drinks (Im talking 15 minutes had passed). Had difficulty flagging down the waitress since we had already ordered the food. Finally got her, mentioned the bar drinks, she briefly attempted to say \"hmmm, they never came out?\" but thought better of it and trailed off and left. Came back with our drinks in about 5 minutes.
I ordered a buffalo chicken flatbread. Bread it was. It was flavorful, but the bread was not crispy. It was very soft and fluffy, which isn't how imagine a flatbread to come out. 
I don't recall what the others in my party ordered, but it was edible I suppose.
Don't come here unless you are desperate or want to watch a million TVs."}
{"text":"Three of us went there from office during lunch time. It was almost empty and we got a table right away. So this part was ok but the rest of the experience, specially the customer service part, was really bad. 

One of my co-workers had ordered \"Sweet Potato Fries\" but instead the waiter served regular fries. Then after pointing it out, she fixed it. 

I ordered \"CRISPY SHRIMP NOODLE BOWL\" - the description of which says \"Egg noodles piled high in a ramen-style broth. Finished with sliced almonds...\". So I was expecting some sort of broth instead the bowl came with dry noodles with a big soup spoon (!?!#$@) and there was no trace of almond anywhere. The noodle was very sweet, so I asked the server if she can give me some hot sauce. She nodded her head, left the table and never came back with hot sauce or informed us that they don't have any hot sauce. 

My other co-worker had ordered \"HERBED MUSHROOM AND SHAVED PARMESAN\" which also had a kind of sweet and flat taste.

At some point we pointed out the mismatched description of the broth to the server. She just gave us a blank look, no \"sorry\" or any kind of feedback that she would talk to the chef/management so that they can fix this in the future - as if we were talking to a tree. 

The final surprise was when the bill came, the machine had default tip percentages of \"20%\", \"25%\" or \"30%\" - there was no option to change it. We just felt cheated and eventually left the place with extreme bitterness by giving 20% tips for some extremely bad customer service and very average quality of food."}
{"text":"Not good. Hostess \"forgot\" to clear our table to seat us. We stood and waited for 10 minutes. No apology. The server messed up my husbands order and we are while he waited. By the time it arrived we were done. Again, no apology. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Ended up coming here on Sunday because we had the dogs and needed somewhere with a patio. I put my name on the wait list (after being cut by a very rude woman, no fault of the restaurants) and after about 10 minutes we were seated outside. The menu itself was very typical for this type of establishment, it featured tons of burgers, appetizers, flatbreads, and whatever else you would expect. I ended up going with \"The Closer\" which is a deep fried chicken sandwich with bacon on it. The sandwich itself was pretty good for what it was and I could say the same for the french fries. Overall, this was a pretty average experience, but it's almost exactly what you would expect from a similar chain restaurant. I wouldn't mind coming back in the future to watch a game and eat a burger though."}
{"text":"Timber!!!!! So I got the lumberjack burger because the description and the recommendation from the waitress. Her service was fine but the burger wasn't. It had a pretzel bun so I was imagining it to be soft and buttery but it was not. It was not up to my expectations. Visiting this restaurant was not a high light of my trip.

The burger and fries came out to be a little over $20 CAN. The only good part was the poutine and it was luckily recommended by the waitress or else I would not have a pleasant meal. The poutine had a unique savory taste and the gravy was spot on.

Overall, I did not like this place so well. It's a typical sports bar and pretty close to the Waterfront so that's a place. The prices seem somewhat average but the quality was lacking."}
{"text":"The worst. Went in and waited to be sat by a hostess. When none came we decided to seat ourselves. Sat there for about 10 mins, when no one came to greet us I walked over to the bar and asked if a server can be sent to us. Went back to our table and waited for another 6, 7 mins with not even a hello. At that point we gathered our things and left."}
{"text":"Flatbread, Chicken wings, shrimp quesadilla are great. We usually order here to pick up for our party Friday night."}
{"text":"Horribly slow.   Waited approximately 40 minutes for food. Expensive.  Food was meh.   Wait staff pleasant"}
{"text":"Got some coupons in the mail and saw a salt & vinegar fish sandwich that sounded interesting so we figured we'd check it out. Went in on a busy, but not packed Saturday night, was seated right away and drink orders were given before we had a chance to open the menu. Drinks came, sandwich and salad were ordered and we sat back and watched the 2nd period of the Raps/Cavs game. And the halftime. And most of the 3rd period. After waving down a waitress to comment on the unusually long wait, she notified our server who came by and said she'd get the manager. She said that 2 more times during which our food finally came. Then the manager came looking like he'd been listening to disgruntled customers all day. He listened to us, offered us either a free dessert or a discounted bill, then left. When it was time to leave, and after correcting our bill a couple times, we finally left, lamenting about the poor service and disinterested management response.

As for my sandwich, it could've used some salt and vinegar flavor."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick bite, was served cold food; waitress disappeared for 30+ minutes- the service needs help here. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Typical sports bar, with lots of TVs.  Food was mediocre.  The waitress was able to offer my friend who is gluten intolerant many suggestions.  Except, when her food came, her burger was a patty in between two salad pieces.  Our other friend ordered fries, and they arrived frigid.  I had no complaints about my food, it was exactly what I had expected."}
{"text":"We had the sampler and it wasn't pleasant. The chicken was hard, the chips were stale, and I'll stop there. Could've been because it was a large group, but that hasn't hindered us in the past."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant a few times, and nothing really stands out besides the convenience of it's location. The food is average (avoid the steak pasta!), the drinks are cold, and the wait staff are par.

You won't have a horrible experience dinning here, but it won't knock your socks off either."}
{"text":"This place is an enigma to me. The reason why is because although I am not a 4 star fan of this place but they do have some very good qualities and I don't have any legitimate complaints about this place either. How stupid does that sound?

First off, this place is my go to destination for watching UFC fights. They have about 8-10 tv's lined up around the walls and have a bigger one in the bar area. The other very amazing deal is a 34oz of subzero Canadian or Coor's Light for $6 on Monday's. Although limited to those 2 beers, I do enjoy Subzero beer and have not experienced this type of deal outside of a dive bar.

Their food is pretty good as well. During fight times, I see many a dish of nacho's coming out and also the bruschetta bread. My last visit I did order the bruschetta to see what all the fuss was about and it was really good. They put a balsamic reduction and some garlic ranch drizzle on their bread. I know why everyone orders it now.
Their entree's are pretty good as well. They have quite a diverse selection of food and although unspectacular, it is a satisfying meal. I had their bison burger and my wife had a beef dip, both of which we found good.

Their deserts also are pretty unique. My wife absolutely loves the desert nachos, which are some sort of cinnamon tortilla chip (do not think regular nacho chips with cinnamon on them) drizzled with caramel and chocolate chips and a scoop of ice cream. A nice desert to finish off a meal.

The one think I do not like about their place is I find their prices to be a little steep. Most of their appetizers are in the 8-11 dollar range, and their dinners are pretty varied, coming from a $10 burger, to a $13 salad and more for a steak.

Finally, I think their wait staff do a good job of serving and their patio is fairly big.

After all these things I've said, I still don't know why I won't give them 4 stars. Actually, I think it may partly be because they have all these HD tv's and yet no HD feed is being shown. I'm not sure what the other reasons are."}
{"text":"The service was terrible. We came in after a Blue Jay's game to get some food. We waited over 2 hours to get our food. By the time our food arrived, we didn't even want it. We understand that it was busy but a little communication would have gone a long way. The server didn't stop at our table to let know it would take longer so we could make alternative plans after settling up. The lack of communication was a slap in the face. Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"This is a real ok place to stop and get lunch which is exactly what I did. We sat in the outdoor seating out front. Their menu has a variety of items, sandwiches, burgers, nothing too crazy.
I had ordered a Reuben and it was good. I had a side of fries as well, I feel like they kinda skimped on that.
The service wasn't the greatest. Our server barely saw us at all.
Overall the experience was ok, nothing bad but nothing that stood out."}
{"text":"Staying at the Radisson and stopped in for dinner. Great burger special. Was great and came with a side said. Topped it off with a beer really good atmosphere and beer. Will Be Back"}
{"text":"I live less than 150 yards from there yet I would be more compelled to eat dirt. The food is simply awful. That being said it's not a bad place for a pint, just make sure you eat before you arrive."}
