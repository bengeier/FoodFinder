{"text":"Lovely old Edwardian/early 20th Century cafe. Great location and the terrace is a perfect place to enjoy lunch or a coffee.
Food good, nice coffee and scones, cakes etc but watch your change - my wife and the man in front of her were overcharged. Money refunded without question and we hope both incidents were genuine mistakes."}
{"text":"To be honest, this is the kind of place which has seen better days in the past. I would imagine that, due to its location right on the sea front and just above the beach, it is beaten by harsh weather quite often. As a result, it looks a little tired from the outside.


 Despite that, and probably because of its location, between Easter and the end of the summer holidays its always busy here. Theres an outdoors seating area with the usual standard plastic seats and tables, and space inside for quite a few people.


 The food and rink is as you ould expect - straightforward and ok. Nothing out of the ordinary or anything like that - teas, coffees, soft drinks, sandwiches, crisps, chocolate, cakes and so on. Prices are reasonable and as its the only place once you're past the Spa its an OK place to stay a while and grab a snack.


 Nothing ground breaking, but a friendly place which probably does all you'd expect it to do."}
{"text":"Caf√© di fronte al mare con una vista mozzafiato. Staff giovane ma clienti molto vecchie :/ hanno tanto dolci per la colazione ma offrono anche servizio al tavolo con una cucina semplice e veloce: patatine fritte, pesce fritto e panini vari. Non si viene certo qui x il cibo ;)"}
