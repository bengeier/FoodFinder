{"text":"I really enjoy the food here.  They have an excellent selection, especially for vegetarian options. It's a hidden gem within a strip mall, and it's totally worth the visit. It's clean, quiet, and authentic. I like to get the veggie combo. The injera is soft and fresh. I've been eating Ethiopian food for a few years, and this place is definitely a favorite."}
{"text":"Fantastic food! I adore Ethiopian food and have been disappointed by other Ethiopian restaurants in the valley. This place is the real deal though. The food is really, really good--some of the best I've had. We've been twice now and both times had a variety of veggie dishes (mesir wat is always my favorite but the shiro and kik alicha here are really delicious) and meat dishes. The kitfo is fantastic and the doro wat came with heaps of delicious sauce to scoop up with injera. Unlike other reviewers, both times we visited we had more food than we needed and I was happy with the value for money.    The couple who run/own the restaurant are very lovely and accommodating, but the service and ambiance could use some work. The first time we went in, Christian talk radio was playing; last night it was Ethiopian tv. Music would definitely help the vibe and make the place a bit more comfortable for guests.    In all, I'm super stoked that this place has opened up near me and look forward to many visits in the future."}
{"text":"Came here with some Ethiopian friends who recommended the place. Food is good, healthy, and we were really well treated. But I can't stress this enough, if you are not used to spicy food ask before eating, not everything is spicy but I tasted the most hot spice in my life there! Pros only!"}
{"text":"Very tasty food. Nice restaurant. The neighbourhood is sketchy, ambience is not great, but the food is amazing.Service is excellent. They give large quantities of food, so make sure you are aware before you order."}
{"text":"We were driving by this area looking for a spot to have lunch and he spotted this little place and we noted the great reviews so we stopped in. Azeeb was so very gracious and invited us to try a couple dishes. I'm a veggie girl and her choice for me was spot on! We were interested in coffee as well so she actually roasted our coffee beans and brought them out for us to enjoy the aroma while they roasted. So cool!!! We will be back"}
{"text":"Food was AMAZING! Home cooking at its finest! Joshua and his wife are extremely kind, gracious, and generous.  We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Awesome service! Don't skip the coffee ceremony at the end either... Especially if you want to stay up for a few hours (strong stuff)."}
{"text":"I don't know why I waited so long to try Abyssinia- but I'm so glad I finally did!! We enjoy Ethiopian food and found the food to be flavorful and fresh! The restaurant is casual and clean and I loved the decor. The gal who served us was very helpful and friendly. We shared the Abyssinia Platter with all vegetarian options and were blown away at how delicious everything was! It came with a large variety of options and several pieces of injera. The platter was the perfect size for the two of us to share. The spices were amazing and super tasty! I highly recommend trying this yummy spot!!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent and gluten free!!! My family had a wonderful time and we were cared for beautifully. We will be back soon"}
{"text":"We were looking for some place different to eat. Not only did we find different we found delicious.  Our first time here but won't be the last! I was unsure of what to order so I put my trust in the waitress. She recommended a sampler platter that we both were able to share. Words can not express the amount of flavor on one plate. Loved this place and will be back."}
{"text":"I went here the other night because I had never eaten Ethiopian food and I wanted to expand my horizons a little bit. The server was very helpful and he recommended that we try the Abyssinian Vegetarian so we could sample a variety of dishes. It wasn't too busy when I went so it didn't take long at all for the food to come to my table and I was not let down! I loved everything that was included in the meal, especially the cabbage and the greens. It is so refreshing to have so many vegetarian options available to me. I also ordered a Sambussa and they were honestly one of the best things I've ever eaten (perfect flavors and consistency inside and out, I could probably eat like 50 of them.)   You can tell that the owner takes a lot of pride in her food and her restaurant, and rightfully so. I will definitely be returning again."}
{"text":"Really good food. Fun and adventurous. Good service. Nicely decorated. But, sorry to say it, bathrooms could use a cleaning."}
{"text":"Went here with my family last night and nobody but myself has been to an Ethiopian restaurant before. Our waiter was excellent he made everyone feel comfortable and explanation of the food was spot on. He recommended a sampler plate from the menu plus a goat dish.  All the food was excellent and we had the right amount of food. I highly recommend this place and looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"An amazing place to dine with family and friends. The food is fantastic and the people are very warm.  I am defenetly going back."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely incredible here. We ordered the veggie platter and it came with plenty of food for two people. I loved being able to sample the different veggie dishes since this was my first time and was able to pick out a few favorites. I also got that Dora wat chicken and it was delicious with some spice to it! I highly recommend this place to all foodies especially those trying to get a unique experience unlike any other restaurant. Our server was also very friendly and kind. A+ on all levels. Make sure you buy the $15 Groupon if it is available because it gives you $30 worth of credit (50% off)."}
{"text":"Outstanding! Went there for lunch today(Saturday) and were surprised we were the only ones in the place. I've eaten at every Ethiopian restaurant in Arizona and dozens of others across the country. So far this place is the best in AZ. Hope they stick around for a long time."}
{"text":"We have been here twice, and it is our new Ethiopian favorite.  Each time, we order the Abyssinian combo with a few meat sides.  The food is delicious, the environment is welcoming, and the service is great."}
{"text":"We've been here twice now -- once with just the hubby and I, and the second time we knew we had to bring the kids.  The owners are so friendly!  They kept insisting we take more injeera (that delicious flat bread that you eat everything with) and gave my kids an impromptu lesson on Ethiopia.  The food is amazing (I especially loved all of the chickpea dishes), and I can't wait until the next time we go back!  Now I just need to actually save room to try some dessert.. they give you so much food that I keep being too full!"}
{"text":"We came in to eat for lunch. I was blown away I got the beef #15. The Az (pronounced \"as\") was super sweet.  The service was swift. The food was amazing. I find myself craving it every day. It's all authentic and well priced. I wish more people would frequent this jem. Don't for get to try the Honey Wine it's amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent!  We ordered a sampler of vegetarian and meat dishes, and all were excellent.  The coffee was delicious, too- beans are roasted right there and you get to smell them while they are roasting."}
{"text":"We are SO excited to have found this place!! We are Chicago transplants and I'm pretty sure Ethiopian food is, like, 50% of our love language at least. So glad this is in Phoenix! The prices are reasonable, the service was warm, and the food was incredible. All the flavors were nicely balances and the injera was perfect - not too sour. Just heaven in your big fat mouth. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Modest & laid back everything was delicious as expected. The beets from the vegetarian combo was my favorite"}
{"text":"Excellent Ethiopian food - genuine and delicious.  We ordered the mixed vegetables and a meat dish on the recommendation of the restauranteur - he was very helpful and considerate of our tastes. The food was excellent - generous portions of everything, each vegetable had its own distinctive flavor, and the meat was perfectly cooked with berbere and other delights. Of course, we ate it all with our fingers and torn up bits of the tasty injera in the traditional way. To top it off, the honey wine complemented the meal perfectly.  A terrific meal - we'll be back!"}
{"text":"The vegetarian plater was delicious and the sambusa off the scale! It would have been the ideal amount for 3 people.  Definitely for people who like things on the spicy side. We enjoyed sitting in the traditional room. The traditional coffee ritual is a wonderful experience. The bathroom needed some tlc so that dropped the rating down one star."}
{"text":"I don't regularly leave reviews but this place was way too spectacular not to. The vibe in here is great and the food is...well there's just no words for it. Super humble and helpful staff. The coffee ceremony was amazing and one of the most unique dining experiences ever."}
{"text":"I love this place! The service is amazing and everyone is so nice. The portions and prices are good, especially for a college student! 10/10 would recommend!"}
{"text":"The food and service here is amazing!!!  I was very impressed with the various spices used when cooking, making the food taste quite delightful.  After our food, we enjoyed some tasteful coffee.  I'll definitely be returning in the near future."}
{"text":"The food here was delicious  Service was good  One of the best Ethiopian restaurant. Glad I visited while in Phoenix"}
{"text":"Went here with my Ethiopian coworker and I have never had Ethiopian food and it was AMAZINGGGGG. I am from Dallas and in town for work we have been trying to eat anything but chilis and fudruckers. This was awesome. The food ranges from no spice to spicy, with beef chicken and lamb dishes. There is an expansive vegetarian selection too. The food is served with a pancake looking bread called injara and it's delish.   Eat here. You won't regret it. It's authentic but not too much for people not used to eating ethnic food."}
{"text":"Still the best Ethiopian food in Phoenix! We asked for their recommendation and it was absolutely amazing!"}
{"text":"Delicious and fabulous food! What a great hidden find in central Phoenix. The owner described the food choices to us and allowed us to make a vegetable and meat platter. The chickpeas, lentils and potato are delicious vegetarian choices. The chicken was so tender, I couldn't believe how delicious it was. The owners are so nice and friendly. It's a very cute place to eat family style. Bring lots of people as portions are reasonable!"}
{"text":"The food was okay but I've had better Ethiopian in the valley. The service was inattentive. They brought our food and we never saw them again and we were the only ones in the restaurant. The ambience with cute. They had a little place in the back styled with what I'm assuming is authentic Ethiopian restaurant decor."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic, hitting every taste bud just right. Their sambussa's were delicious, honey wine was sweet, coffee was strong, and this spread was all things good."}
{"text":"This is really a fantastic restaurant. It has only been open a short amount of time, but the owners take a real sense of pride in their food and it really shows. Check it out especially if you have never had ethiopian food, it is really tasty."}
{"text":"Sooo good! I have been wanting to try Ethiopian food for a couple of years now. And who doesn't love to eat with their hands on purpose?! Traditional food is a shared experience and I finally had friends in town that wanted to try it as well. I ordered the honey wine, which came in a cute carafe. My cousin ordered the traditional hot tea. Side note: they offer a traditional tea ceremony as well! We ordered the sampler dish. It's huge! Easily shared between 5 people!!! We shared between 3 and took home leftovers. There were only a handful of each dish, but there were so many for selection!! The food came on a platter that was covered with the bread, plus a few more rolls of the bread. There was a dish of lentils, yellow peas, chickpeas, beef and jalapeño, collard greens, spicy lamb and more. There were individual dishes and smaller sampler dishes too. Everything was flavorful and distinct."}
{"text":"Wow! What a delicious and wonderful experience. We came to Abyssinia for a family celebration. We didn't know what to expect and we were very pleased with the absolutely top notch, authentic Ethiopian food and hospitality. We will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"Great food friendly service and fun unique atmosphere . Highly recommend ! We had the vegetarian platter to sample everything and it was all delicious and started yet the sambussa which was very tasty . Very inexpensive and filling"}
{"text":"Go to this place! The food is incredible and the place is charming. Don't skip the coffee. We got the 2 different sampler plates for 5 adults and 4 kids. We also tried the sambussa, they were delicious. Don't expect everything to be out in 5 minutes, it's flavorful food that takes a while to cook. The owner is so kind and patiently showed the kids how she roasts coffee. We will be back."}
{"text":"Fantastic first experience eating Ethiopian food. We ordered the large vegetarian platter which comes with plenty of Injera on both the side and underneath the food so the juices and flavors from the food gets soaked up. This flatbread is to be used in lieu of any utensils. We thought it was delightful! It has a spongy texture, is gluten-free, and apparently is very healthy! Our beverages consisted of: Ethiopian beer, honey wine, and the coffee with ceremony. Hannah, our waitress, was pleasant, helpful, and relaxed. In fact, the overall ambiance was extremely relaxed. The food was savory yet light, and although we were full, we didn't feel heavy. The honey wine was not overly sugary and they have both an alcoholic and non-alcoholic option. The coffee ceremony was the cherry on top for our night. The pan-roasted beans were brought out to us to smell prior to grinding. The order was presented on a traditional set including: jebena (clay pot), small cups, incense resin, and sugar. Luckily my husband and I enjoy dark coffee and the smell of incense so this was perfect for us. I felt a bit guilty that the entire restaurant now smelled like roasted coffee and incense...but at least it's a pleasant smell - you're welcome! We've already recommended this place to our friends and will continue to spread the word! We'll be back for sure :)"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery online through Yelp Eat24.  No response from restaurant.  Yelp staff called multiple times over an hour with no response (main number and managers number).  I tried to call the restaurant with no answer and a voicemail that disconnected.  No food and no response.  Bummer."}
{"text":"The spicy beef was good but other than that... I can't really find anything that would make me come back.  Granted, it was my first time eating Ethiopian and maybe it's just not my thing.  The tea was too sweet. The \"bread\" was too sour and the texture reminded me of tripe."}
{"text":"So my girlfriend and I decided that we would order some take out the other night. It was our first time going here, but we've been wanting to check it out. Takeout- ready in record time The way it was packaged didn't make sense at all to me. The had piled all the food on top of each other. Anyways, we separated it. We ordered the vegetarian combo. It was lacking flavor. It was pretty boring and bland, but not horrible. Authentic Ethio African Spices on McDowell unfortunately set my expectations of Ethiopian food way too high."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! Don't be fooled by the outside, the inside of this restaurant is super cute and the food is SO GOOD. My family got the Abyssinia Signature sampler platter and another entree to share and every single thing was delicious. The service was great and atmosphere was relaxing. If you're looking for great Ethiopian food or looking to try something new I highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"I am so glad there is good Ethiopian food close to my house! no more driving to Tempe! The owners are friendly and will explain the menu!"}
{"text":"The food is great tasting. One of the best Ethiopian Restaurants I have ever visited. I have been eating this type of food for twenty years. You should really visit the place."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try Ethiopian food in Phoenix, having had terrific success in Tucson, and we took a friend who had never had it before.  3 bites in we were making plans to return - that's how good it was.  We got the Abyssinian Vegetarian sampler, and, as they do not have a meat sampler, ordered Doro Wat and the beef Yebeg Alicha Wat.  When it came, our server said the Yebeg Alicha Wat was lamb; it tasted like beef to us - but whatever meat it was, it was delicious.  Our guest and I immediately decided the Shiro (milled chickpeas with herbs and onion) was basically edible crack and almost came to blows over it.    The Abyssinian platter contains: red lentils, yellow lentils, green lentils, Shiro, beets, salad, potatoes and carrots, green beens and onions, and cabbage and carrots (feel free to find their names by matching them up with the descriptions on the menu in the photos :)  Besides the Shiro, which I could bathe in, our favorites were the Doro Wat, (a bit spicy but I'm a wimp) Yebeg Alicha Wat, green beans, cabbage, potatoes, red lentils (also had a bite to them) and the beets.  The yellow lentils were at the bottom of our list, and the green lentils were good but not outstanding.  We were served plenty of injera with which to eat our meal; I am used to the injera having a wonderful sour taste, which this injera did not have, and I missed it.  Our server was so nice and helpful, and I was pleased to see at least 5 sets of diners while we were there - this place deserves to be patronized (dictionary meaning 2)  Like I said, we are planning our next trip.  You should, too."}
{"text":"It feels strange to say, but I've had much better Ethiopian food in Kentucky. I guess Louisville is more cosmopolitan than we give credit.  I got the veggie combo, and the review from Brian S. is spot on. Mine was not quite as skimpy as his because I got an additional serving of beets (which I hate). I missed the greens too. When I had the misir wat (red lentils) in Kentucky, the dish was so good that I was looking up recipes for it when I got home. Abyssinia's version was lackluster in flavor although it did have a spicy bite. The only thing that I really liked was a smooth reddish brown puddle. I'm not sure what it was, but it was really tasty. The funny thing is my husband had the same looking puddle on his chicken plate, but he said it tasted differently. He left it untouched. His chicken got eaten up, but he wasn't wowed by it in any way.  The owner served us with a big smile, and that is worth a lot. I wouldn't come back, but I'm glad there was a Yelp deal to prompt us to give it a shot."}
{"text":"If you want to try authentic and delicious ethiopian cuisine,  this is the place to find it. The food is always fresh and spiced just right. Not to mention a welcoming experience by the workers. If you love beef, try the firm tibs, which is meat sizzling in spiced butter, with sauteed jalapenos and onions. It also comes with injera, a traditional ethiopian tortilla/wrap that is used in most traditional meals."}
{"text":"This was my first experience with Ethopian food, so we asked the proprietor for a recommendation.  She was extremely helpful and recommended a large variety of meat and vegetarian dishes.  We took her advice and ordered each of her recommendations.  We were presented with a HUGE platter of many different tasty items, much more food than I and my friend could possibly finish.  It was a fun experience, and if you've not tired Abyssinia, I'd recommend it."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  I went there with my wife and one of her friends for lunch.  It was the first time any of us tried Ethiopian food.  The host, who I believe is one of the owners, was very friendly, and gave us suggestions about what to order.  Once the food arrived, we could not stop eating it!  The meats were very delicious, and the injera was great when it soaked up all the flavor.  I'll definitely be back, though I'd recommend bringing more than just two people.  Even with three of us, we couldn't finish our food."}
{"text":"Best ethopian food in all of phoenix. We drive 35 minutes just to eat here. Everything that we have got to eat here has been amazing and the service is just as good."}
{"text":"We had the Honey Wine as well as the Key Wat, and Yebeg Alicha Wat. Afterwards we had the ceremonial Ethiopian coffee. Everything was fantastic.  I absolutely loved the Honey Wine, it tasted like honey, citrus, and champagne all in one. The Key Wat and Yebeg Alicha Wat were both tender and well seasoned.  The ceremonial coffee was excellent, they will roast the coffee right in front of you so you can smell it and will also provide incense when they serve the coffee. You can get about 11 cups or more out of the $10 amount. Well worth it since it's basically espresso.   The service, food, drinks, and atmosphere were all excellent. I will be back for more coffee!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, delightful service. This is an intimate restaurant which does not suit large parties. However, they have the cutest party area set up in the corner where they simulate an Ethiopian traditional hut with cute dinner settings. It is lit with gallery spots and added to the dining ambiance. They even have an Ethiopian Traditional Coffee Ceremony.   Hubby and I came here for an early lunch at 10:40 am. They open at 10 am. We couldn't decide on what to order so the lady in charge recommended the Combination Platter. We were not steered wrong.   Check-in Special: Sammuusas with 2 entrees. Weekday Lunch Specials: $7.99 for 3 items.  Our Combination Platter, we chose both meat and vegetables. Firm Tibs, prime beef with grilled onions, jalapeno and Ethiopian butter, Aterkik Alicha, split yellow peas in red onion, olive oil, garlic and various homemade spices, Azifah (Brown Lentils,whole brown lentils blended with onion, green pepper and spices), cooked greens, Tickle Gomen Delicious curried vegetable stew with cabbage, green pepper, onion and olive oil, Yebeg Alicha Wat (Tender strips of lamb simmered in homemade herbal butter seasoned with onions, olive oil, garlic and Ethiopian spices), Shiro Chickpeas are milled together with a perfect blend of mild herbs and onion slowly cooked. These fabulous dishes were served traditionally in a large platter atop a large Injera (Ethiopiona raised flatbread). Each dish had its own distinct and aromatic flavor profile. They also bring more Injera on the side. We ate with our hands traditional style. I do believe they will provide silverware if asked.  Tip: When you order water, you are paying for bottled water.   We were so stuffed and brought home a lot of food to enjoy later. I would love to go there again with some of my international foodies.   *Even though it is a hole-in-a-wall in a strip mall in the middle of central Phoenix, it is definitely worth seeking out. The food was comparable to Dukem, one of my favorite Ethiopian restaurants in DC."}
{"text":"Best Ethiopian food I've found in the valley... portions are great and the food is awesome!"}
{"text":"The veggie combo I got here has the unfortunate distinction of being both the skimpiest and the priciest I've ever been served, and I've ordered them in 11 cities and four time zones. My first thought when it was served was, \"Wait ... is that an appetizer?\" My plate came with the requisite lentils and cabbage, as well as pureed potatoes in place of the customary solid ones.   The two problems with the servings: their size, given that the plate they were served on was largely injera, and a lack of variety. I'd been hoping for greens and yellow split peas, which commonly come with vegetarian combos along with salad greens.   I was tempted to order kitfo -- raw beef -- to fill out my plate but took comfort in the fact that at least my bill likely would be small. Surely, a veggie combo that's half the size of some I've been served elsewhere would be half the price, right? Quite the contrary; my bill was more than $14 for about $7 worth of food.  The restaurant's atmosphere is a saving grace; it's bright and inviting. There's free Wi-Fi; you just have to ask an employee for the password. And while I've had to work to get employees' attention at some other Ethiopian restaurants, that wasn't the case here. People were quite friendly.   Based on some other reviewers' pics, perhaps visiting here as part of a group results in getting more food and better variety. But if your solo experience is anything like mine was, the results will be underwhelming for both your palate and your pocketbook."}
{"text":"Umm I like Authentic Ethio African restaurant a lot better. I ordered from here only because they were willing to deliver. The restaurant immediately asked for more time, so whatever I knew it would take more than an hour no big deal. After leaving extremely detailed instructions As to how to get to my house, I get a phone call because the driver is lost. Very, very, lost. So I have to walk around my complex barefoot in a robe looking for this person and when I find her she refuses to listen to me when I tell her to stop driving and that I'm coming to get the food out of the car. If I had known it was going to be a goose chase I would have gone somewhere else. The delivery person was nice, and I tipped her VERY well, but it defeated the purpose of getting delivery. So unprofessional! The food itself is ok, I got the Tickle gomen it was so bland and it's like I got charged $9 for steamed cabbage with injera. The Gomen Besiga is flavorful, but tough. I wish they offered berebere stew, and that their dishes had better descriptions. I'm giving them an extra star simply for offering delivery and sometimes you just want to stay home, have Ethiopian food delivered and watch game of thrones. Not thrilled, probably not going back, definitely not eating the Tickle Gomen."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by the amazing and sincere service. Food was tasty. Location is in a kind of old shopping center. Clean restaurant. Interested in trying the special coffee ceremony they have. Buy the special Groupon available or use Yelp to get a discount."}
{"text":"First time trying Ethiopian foods this place was perfect. Great service and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I've had a lot of luck with Abyssinia, but for some reason my order left much to be desired. Sambusa's didn't come with any sauce like last time and our portions we're really small. Food quality was on point through, just not sure what happened. Totally didn't justify the $25."}
{"text":"I'm on a mission to try every Ethiopian restaurant in the Phoenix area and this one did not disappoint! Try the dorowet and veggie platter! Also getting to eat with your hands makes for a fun experience."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a delicious authentic meal, Abyssinia got you, great flavors very hospitable staff and plenty of choices for Ethiopian natives and food enthusiasts alike."}
{"text":"Had a great time, and staff were extremely accommodating! When we first got there, there was no staff to greet us, and they had a coffee ceremony going on with lots of incense burning. When we did finally get noticed, we expressed concern about the smoke because we were expecting family with a 3 month old to join us for dinner. They said the ceremony was almost done, and opened the front door to start airing out the place right away. We also wanted to bring in cupcakes from a local bakery (for a birthday), so we called ahead to check and again they were perfectly fine with it - they even offered to store them in the fridge for us while we ate, and brought out plates and plastic forks without us asking! I was concerned about the price going in, based on another review. Prices were all clearly marked on the menu. We asked about the special platter ($40), and we were told it was enough for 5 ppl. It was perfect, with even a tiny bit left over! We fed 5 ppl, with a few alcoholic drinks too, for well under $100. It of course all depends what you buy. Oh yeah, and the food...all delicious! I've only eaten at 4 Ethiopian restaurants (they're a bit hard to come by), but I've never been disappointed. Add this one to the list!"}
{"text":"Incredible authentic Ethiopian dining experience. The hosts were wonderful, the food amazing, and the coffee experience one of a kind."}
{"text":"Purchased a groupon didn't like the fact that I couldn't use both on this visit.  However, the food was excellent and the juice divine.  Service was quick and staff was pleasant and answered questions.  I will obviously be back to spend the other half of the groupon but would go anyway as the experience was good."}
{"text":"Serendipity!  We tried to go to another Ethiopian restaurant but they were closed. We ended up here. WOW. We ordered the veggie platter and the meat stew. Absolutely amazing an filling. Prepare to share and use your hands. We will be back."}
{"text":"I would recommend the vegetarian dishes, as well as the lentil soup which is super yum. The samosas are too spicy and I didn't realize that before ordering. The 'macciato' is good cafe au lait. Used a Groupon, so I didn't spend too much, but I would not order anything again besides the yummy lentil soup."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food at wonderful prices with friendly and fantastic service. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. My husband, daughter and I had just landed at PHX and were starving. We were heading up to the mountains for 3 weeks and wanted to get some food we could only get in the city, so we went here.   We ordered the large vegetarian sampler to share and a bowl of the lentil soup.  I really liked the soup - it had a lot of rosemary, which was really unique and very delicious.  The rest of the food was unfortunately the worst Ethiopian food we've ever had, and we are normally big fans. To begin with it was all cold, and a couple of the dishes had a really odd flavor that made us think they may have spoiled. My husband did have some tummy trouble later that afternoon.  Most reviews for this place are so good... So maybe it was just a really off day?? Our experience was terrible and we will not be back."}
{"text":"I love Ethiopian food so this place is pretty decent. The ambiance is nothing spectacular but nonetheless eclectic and bright. I did appreciate the honesty of my server with the menu. He was friendly, knowledgeable and completely honest about other patrons' preferences and popularity of items.    The serving portions are generous for the price.  I was able to substitute one of my entrees with no problem and it was even suggested by the server. The food wasn't as spicy as I would have liked but it had a decent kick since there were jalapeños in one of my dish. The flavor was good but seemed rushed compared to other places I've been to in Ethiopia Town in LA and Phoenix. Still great eats for a quiet low key place."}
{"text":"Some on the signature plate were really good. My favorite were tibs, chicken, and all the beans! I'm not a big fan of bony meats so lambs were my least favorite. Generally they have good flavors and their sambussas have some kick to them. Overall quute satisfactory!"}
{"text":"Delish! Enjoyed my lunch very much and the owners are super friendly and accommodating. 3 thoughts - they should have a lunch special, the prices and portions are kind of large for lunch - they should have more combo platters so we can try several things at once - I would have liked a little more heat in my doro wat, it was very mild compared to my other experiences but the flavor was good. The injera was very good and plentiful and the decor was comfortable. If you are looking for something a little different but not too different I say give this place a try . I can't wait to return"}
{"text":"At our daughter 's suggestion, we came here for amazing food, and it is!!  We shared the Abyssinian Signature platter, a large sampler of many of their dishes. Everything was authentic and tasty. While we did not leave room for dessert, a glass of fresh mango juice was a refreshing end to the meal. The service was great - friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Searching for a new Ethiopian spot can be hard in a new city, but Abyssinia was a good start. Overall everything was good; food, service, etc. it wasn't mind blowing though.  Perhaps we were spoiled at our old spot in our former city where the servings were huge (7-8 servings on a veggie combo) , flavors robust and everything was served on a hotter temperature scale."}
{"text":"We had a great experience at this place. I love to honor local businesses and support owner operated places. The food is amazing, the service is great - you must try the coffee as they roast the coffee beans right in front of you. The owner's personal story is also remarkable and I enjoy seeing people that come to this country, work hard and are grateful. Abyssinia has become a required stop every time I come to town."}
{"text":"Authentic and delicious Ethiopian food.... best of all, real injera!   This means that the songy flatbread served with the meal is slightly sour, and lacks the stretchy texture that most places now have created with the addition of white flour. I don't know for certain, but it seems like this place is staying true to tradition with real teff flour.  My issues...   The portion sizes. It isn't that they are to small, it is that they are inconsistent, it seems like they sort of adjust the amounts based on how many people you have at the table? This sort of makes sense, but the issue is that we didn't get enough food... and now next time I don't know if I should order more, or if I should just hope they serve us more? We ordered two 20$-ish plates, and were assured it would be enough food. It just seems like the $20 meat dish was added on as an extra scoop to the veggie dish... I dunno, I hate leaving places hungry.  The honey wine. I love that they are making their own honey wine, that's awesome! Also I know that it's a process that varies, so I don't want to go to hard over only sampling a single batch. However, the bottle we got had to of been less the 1% alcohol... Now I've experimented with homemade mead (honey wines) and I know that getting them up to regular wine percentages is near impossible, but getting a modest amount is actually quite easy if you take the time. The mead we had here literally tasted like honey water... really expensive honey water."}
{"text":"Awesome lunch special for $7.99. Three choices of meat and veggies with Ethiopian bread. The portion was really big, and we could not even finish it."}
{"text":"The hubs and I were fiending for Ethiopian food and wanted to try someplace new. After seeing the great Yelp reviews for this recently opened restaurant, we felt sure we would find some fantastic food here and we were not disappointed.   Couldn't decide on just one item each so we shared the Veggie Combo, Doro Wat, and Awaze Tibs. The veggie dishes were wonderful, but the Doro Wat and Awaze Tibs were the stars of the plate. Perfectly seasoned, with a great spice level on the Awaze Tibs - and both meats were tender. The injera was also very tasty. We will definitely be coming here again."}
{"text":"I was really impressed with this place . The food was tasty, the service was absolutely delightful, and the atmosphere was very authentic. They even had Ethiopian music on , which I thought was great, because I'm sick of going to foreign cuisine restaurants, and having to listen to the top 40 US music (I'm a big music person, and I love all types of music, not just one kind that's forced on everyone). My favorite part was the Ethiopian coffee serving !! It was super cool (I don't want to say anymore , because you should experience it) . The only thing I didn't love about the place is that it smelled a bit weird/strong. I'm guessing that's due to the herbs that they use , so it's really not a big deal, and I would definitely Go back here ! :) GIVE IT A TRY!!! it's probably the best Ethiopian food you'll find in Phoenix."}
{"text":"First time eating Ethiopian food in Arizona and it's so good here! Me and my boyfriend ordered the Abyssinia signature ($40) and it was amazing! It came with a lottt of food and choices - pretty much all their vegetarian dishes and around 4 meat choices. The vegetarian dishes balance the meat out well! Both our favorites were the beef tibs - it was perfectly crispy but the jalapeños were not over cooked so it was crunchy too!   We also got the sambussa with the yelp deal and their sambussas are really good too! It's pretty spicy too so just watch out if you don't like spicy (but I love it)! But that's also why it's better than the other sambussas I've tried.   In addition their service is exceptional! The waitress we had was very welcoming and had no problem answering any questions we had. Would definitely come back here!!"}
{"text":"First time trying Ethiopian cuisine. Liked it. Flavorful and slightly spicy. Had a chicken dish with a spicy curry. Also tried the vegetable platter which was good. Nice spongy bread to eat the food with your hands."}
{"text":"Update: I'm back two days later. It's that good! The spicy beef was amazing, and I ate way too fast. I had the chick peas and lentils again, because I love them.   Best Ethiopian food I have had in a while. Excellent flavor. Today I did vegetarian. Next time I'll try the meat. Azeb is wonderful and hospitable. She will make sure you are taken care of. Lunch is reasonable. $10 with drink. I will be back. I believe I will eat here or get take out regularly. I recommend this place. Yum!"}
{"text":"I walked in at 1130 and sat down. Waited to be served for 10 minutes and still wasn't being served. I got up and left. Disappointed! I guess I'd stick with other places with good service."}
{"text":"Easily one of the best meals I've ever had!!  The people that work/own this spot are the nicest folks around!  Everyone should check it out."}
{"text":"Abyssinia has great ethiopian food. The restaurant itself is small and intimate (in a size way, not a romantic way) and the service is excellent. Make sure you get the tea when you go -- their's is excellent.   Every time we go, we get the sampler 'platter' and every dish is spiced and flavorful. They definitely take pride in their menu here. I highly recommend Abyssinia if you like Ethiopian food or are considering trying it."}
{"text":"Food wasn't bad, but the meat dishes had too much clarified butter.  The service isn't really service, we were never checked on during our entire meal until the check was dropped off.  (This was frustrating as we needed more injera bread for our meal.)  Also, one of the meat dishes was a little cold.  That was a huge turn off.  It was very smoky inside which made it difficult to enjoy our meal.  My husband and I love Ethiopian food, but I think for a better overall experience I would go to Cafe Lilabela in Tempe.  Maybe a quick lunch, if I happened to be in the area and was really craving Ethiopian food I would return.    With just a few small improvements like better service, giving more Injera bread with the meal, fans to vent out the smoke, and ensuring that all the dishes are hot, it could be a descent hole in the wall Ethiopian restaurant."}
{"text":"My friend and I ordered the $11 vegetarian platter for lunch, adding a couple of meat dishes at the server's suggestion (he assured us that it would only be a few dollars extra per addition). The food was tasty, and arrived promptly. However, our bill was quite high at $34 - not exactly the nominal charge we were promised. And this is the only Ethiopian restaurant I've ever been to that didn't bring barbecue-style wet wipes for our stained and fragrant fingers. A decent midtown option, but next time I'd just as soon drive down to Lalibela."}
{"text":"The owners of this restaurant are an incredible couple and will make you feel like family when you are there.   The beef tibs are amazing and you have to try them."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and service. We got a lamb and vegetarian dish and were very pleased. The \"bread\" that come with the meal is sooooo good!"}
{"text":"We went back last night with some first-timers and my previous review still holds up! We ordered way more Sambusas this time because they are the freaking best."}
{"text":"The food is authentic Ethiopian. Amazing flavor and very reasonable prices with friendly service. Highly recommended! !!!  This  place is truly a treasure..."}
{"text":"I LOVE Ethiopian food, and this place was great! The staff was friendly and helpful and kept us from majorly over-ordering. Convenient location as well. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food probably is 3.5 stars. But the owners/staff are so very sweet and accommodating that they deserve 4 stars.   Every state that I have ever lived in my husband and I have tried every Ethiopian establishment possible so were pretty familiar with the tastes and flavors of Ethiopian food. Considering that experience, some of the items on the menu were disappointing.   I normally get the veggie combo and my husband gets doro wat. the dishes in veggie combo were just ok flavor wise. initially when they brought me my platter, every dish was cold, so I had to have it sent back. It took them nearly 15-20 minutes to bring me back my platter, apparently they were preparing me a brand new platter. I appreciated the effort and consideration but it took way too long, by that time my husband was already done eating his plate. When they brought my dish back it was missing one of the dishes that the platter comes with; disappointing. Also some of the chick pea dishes and the lentil dishes were super dry not what im used to. My husband was a little unhappy with his doro wat, he felt it lacked in flavor and spice. He told the owner/staff about it and he was kind enough to bring some spicy beef dish for my husband to try and that too free of charge.   The restaurant itself is nice, probably one of the better decorated Ethiopian restaurants I have been to. The air circulation within the restaurant leaves something to be desired. While we were there they must have just started cooking but the restaurant was filled with a slight smoke and both my husband and I had irritated eyes the whole time while we were waiting for our food.   Service was slow even though we were the only ones there. Its a fairly new restaurant so maybe they are working out their kinks. I might give them a try again if im close to the area but I am not sure I would make the 40 min drive just for that unlike some other Ethiopian places I know.   Still worth a try."}
{"text":"I've never eaten Ethiopian food before, but my old boss used to rave about it so I've always wanted to try it. Unfortunately, the hubby is not one to try \"new\" things sometimes.   Last night though, I managed to get him to visit because it was my birthday. How can he say \"no\" on my birthday, right? Honestly, I didn't want to go anywhere fancy. I had a long day and I looked like I was ready to go to bed, so I wanted to go somewhere inconspicuous.   The restaurant was a little hard to find at night. It was located in a plaza with limited lighting so I thought they were closed. When we walked in, the decor had bright colors and there were two other patrons. We didn't receive much service but we did tell the woman employee taking our order that it was our first time. I asked for her recommendations and she practically ordered for us: a veggie and beef plate (see pic).   Surprisingly, everything was good and a tad spicy.  We ended up with a doggie bag and it was still good the next day. Our check came to around $32.   Overall, if you want to try something new or if you love Ethiopian food, come over! I'm glad I did.  Note: you eat with your hands so no utensils!"}
{"text":"This place was great! Awesome food, great courteous customer service and obvious good management. Not only was everybody kind but very accommodating here. My favorite was the Doro Wat and the coffee is to die for. I would recommend anybody go here, they are not stingy with the portions, so make sure to take your appetite."}
{"text":"Having never experienced Ethiopian food, we decided to try this place.  Super nice owner who was friendly and talkative.  We enjoyed our talk and asked if the Vegetarian Combo with meat was enough food to share.  The owner agreed that this was a good choice. The food came quickly with plenty of extra injera to eat all the good with.  There were red, yellow and green lentils all with different flavors.  There were also 2 beef and a lamb dishes.  All were good and filling.   We had leftovers for another meal.  It is a different and fun experience to eat with your hands.  If you want to try something different to eat, try this."}
{"text":"I can't recommend this place enough. I have gluten and dairy allergies and while they recommend you call in advance to make the gluten free ijara (flatbread), I didn't know this and they catered to me anyway. My party split a vegetable sampler and a meat dish. The food was fantastic and super reasonable. If you have never tried Ethiopian food you definitely need to experience."}
{"text":"This is a very good place. The food is delicious. Price very much the same as the other Ethiopian food restaurants. If you are in a hurry, call ahead of time. They are open 7 days a week."}
{"text":"Best Ethiopian in Phoenix!!!   I have been the the handful of Ethiopian places in the valley and this surpasses them all in my opinion.   Location is in an old strip mall and you wouldn't know it was even there. Inside has a great authentic clean vibe. Plus it smells like delicious spices all around. It seems to be just a husband wife team- he was the server and she is the cook. I didn't get to meet her but he was so friendly and proud of his wife cooking - adorable.   We had the vegetarian platter. This comes with all the staples from the vegetarian section. This is perfect for two or three people to share!! We literally were so full trying to finish everything. Flavors were out of this world and each complimented the other. My favorite were the Beets, collards, red lentils, potatoes and cabbage  Table next to us got a lamb entree and it was gone so fast I'm pretty sure they didn't hate it!  Cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on the way back to LA. Great place, in a small strip mall not too far off the 10. We asked them to kick up the spices a bit and were delighted with the result. All the lentils, collards were great. The spicy fried meats with onions and hot peppers was one of the best Ethiopian meat dishes I've had."}
{"text":"Wonderful new Ethiopian restaurant in mid-town Phoenix!! Family-owned by the husband and his wife who is the chef. I ordered the whole shebang. Vegetarian platter was fantastic (not too much food not too little!) and then the at-table coffee service. Don't be shy here! The owner will help you pick whatever you like to eat and loves to share his culture with those new to Ethiopian cuisine! Super clean and friendly - don't miss out on this gem! Perfect for friends or date-night or with the kiddos of course too."}
{"text":"Don't let the immediate area and front of the business scare you... This place is BOMB!  Definitely recommend the sambusaa appetizer and we got the Angelel  meat/veggie combo.  Beware you will use your fingers to eat!!  You use pancake like bread to pick up your food and eat it like a taco.  This was a great alternative to the norm and someplace we will definitely come back to."}
{"text":"Went there with 2 of my coworkers and we loved it. The portions are huge so we only got two plates and shared. The customer service is very similar to what you would get in a Ethiopia. They're very laid back."}
{"text":"I stopped here to get take out on my way back to Flagstaff, sadly there is no Ethiopian food there so anytime I'm near an Ethiopian restaurant I get a veggie combo. This place was definitely one of my favorites! Portions were good, the food tasted amazing and the services was super fast! I will definitely be back next time I'm in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Looks sketchy from the outside but once you go in, it's a cute place! The incense made the restaurant a bit smoky but the smells added to the atmosphere. We used the Yelp check in offer and got two free samosa-like lentil fried wonders. I got some tea and it was very cinnamon-y. Others asked for water and got cold bottled water so that was a bit sad since I try to steal away from making unnecessary waste. As a party of 5, we ordered two big combo vegetarian entree plates at $19.99 each and we were stuffed by the end! The sour spongey bread together with the assortments of veggies was super yummy. I would definitely recommend this place for vegetarians and gluten-free eaters! Our total bill was just under $60 for 5 people."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! I admittedly didn't know what I was getting myself into as I've never had Ethiopian food before. The proprietor asked me this outright, and then made several suggestions and explained what and how to eat his food (this is traditionally eaten without utensils). This restaurant is intimately set and decorated, and the food is wonderful!"}
{"text":"Mouthwatering food, great prices, warm service. As good as it gets!  My husband and I have been here a couple times. The first time we ordered the veggie combo and chicken dish. Everything was excellent! My only slight gripe is that the chicken came on the same flatbread as the veggies. Not a huge deal but the oil from the chicken seeped to the nearby portions of veggies. I just avoided that area.  We avoided the chicken oil all together the next time by just ordering the veggie combo. It is more than enough for two people to walk out stuffed.  Service was wonderful. Very kind and sweet couple own and operate the place. Also, they have BYOB with no corkage fee! The food pairs well with ice cold craft beer!"}
{"text":"My first experience eating Ethiopian food and it was amazing! I've been here twice now and each time I've had the Sambussa and man oh man they are delicious! The second time I went I had the Tickle Gomen a vegetarian dish and it was sooooo good. I love eating with my fingers in the first place, so I was extremely happy when I found out that no utensils were necessary. Let's not even discuss the traditional ceremonial Ethiopian coffee!!!!! Mmmmm...mmmm...mmmmmm! I'm not even a coffee drinker and I LOVE their coffee!   I'm glad a found a new spot to eat some good east Afrikan food!!!"}
{"text":"I went here with my family and it's one of our new favorites. Per the recommendation of another Yelper, we ordered the Doto Wat and Awaze Tibs. The Doto Wat was perfect for my 7yo and 3yo. A touch spicy for them but good for expanding their palette! If you like spicy, order the Awaze Tibs. My kids father and I fell in love with the dish, and I know I will be craving this dish for days to come!"}
{"text":"Not good, wasted most of the food we ordered. Beef dishes were very bad. Pretty pricey too. Appetizer was ok and the chicken rice dish was ok as well. This was my first Ethiopian restaurant, so not sure if the food is cooked this way in Ethiopia."}
{"text":"We devoured every bite of the vegetarian platter and sucked the spices from our fingers (couldn't help it - even if rude!)  We took our 8 yr old daughter and she loved the lentils and split peas way more than at home. Simply delicious and we can't wait to eat it again."}
{"text":"Amazing quality food, such a fun experience with very genuine service. Would easily do it again!"}
{"text":"I like this place.  The food is really good.  It's a little pricier than its competition Gojo down the road, but the service is better.  The owners/operators have always been super nice.  The only things I took away a star for was that it's kind of in a shady shopping complex, like... people hanging out with hypodermics in the parking lot shady.  That's not really their fault, so that for me is half a star, and the other half a star is when I took a friend and they were randomly closed.  It's a family run place, and I get things happen and sometimes you have close up shop, but it sucked and was embarrassing to take him all  the way there, vouching for the place only to find it wasn't open when it should have been.  It was a one-off, and I would still 100% recommend this place.  Great food, very nice people.  Just... don't linger in the parking lot."}
{"text":"Yum!!! We ordered the Sambussa and the non alcoholic wine to start and then got the vegetarian platter. 3 of us were so full we couldn't even finish. Everything was great and we had a coupon, which made it super inexpensive. We will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant on a saturday night with my brother and sister-in-law. I have never eaten Ethiopian food before and they had eaten here before. It is a small restaurant in a strip mall. It was cosy and clean. When I got there they were setting up for a dinner club with thirty diners expected. I arrived early and sat down and looked at the menu. Everything sounded and looked so good. Tried the honey wine and it was not my cup of tea. My party arrived and we were trying to decide what to order. The owner , a very nice young man, gave us some great suggestions. We decided on the vegetable plate ( my sister-in-law is vegetarian) and the firm tibs. I asked for beef but I think it was lamb that was served. I have disliked lamb all my life but this dish has made me a convert. OMG!!!! The vegetable platter had two types of lentils, roasted beets, corn, greens, cabbage & carrots and potatoes. The injera bread was heavenly. Spongy and with a wonderful tanginess. Really complimented the meal. I can tell you this was the best meal I have ever eaten and growing up with a gourmet cook for a dad I know good food. The organizer of the dining club was upset they didn't hire extra servers for her group. The owners were humping their rears off serving food as fast as they could cook it. It is such a wonderful restaurant the diners should just sit back, relax and enjoy this incredible food. If the owner had come over and kicked me in the shin I still wouldn't have complained or budged from this food. Manna from heaven. So if you want the best meal of your life regardless of cuisine--- run to this restaurant!"}
{"text":"We found this hole in the wall gem and decided to check it out. The food was delicious, but the service was exceptional. If you're looking for great Ethiopian food, check out this family owned restaurant. We ordered the sampler platter and it was enough to feed a small country. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"We three women friends found this very special restaurant on Yelp and are SO glad we did!  Truly delicious vegetarian meal where each one of 8 vegetable dishes was perfectly and uniquely seasoned.  The sambussas were superb and spicy, and the shiro truly delish.  Friendly people rounded out our special meal.  PS Perfect macchiatos, too!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what we ordered but it was the vegetable platter with meat. It was delicious! I recommend it. I left feeling stuffed as I ate so much of the tortilla/pancake thing. The steak with jalapeños was my favorite and the cabbage with carrots were yummy but stained my white shirt. It was worth it. I will definitely return and try some other dishes."}
{"text":"I've eaten at 2 other Ethiopian restaurants in the valley, and this one didn't disappoint. Very small, with nice decor and the portions are a decent size. The fact that I was able to snag a deal on  groupon made it even better!"}
{"text":"I just wanted something flavorful for lunch but it hasn't been a good week for take out. What I got from Abyssinia was so disappointing I didn't even touch it. The stuff in the styrofoam container looked like canned veggies caked with something greasy. (I assumed it was ghee, but I'm not sure.) And the smell was so unpleasantly odorous, I couldn't leave it sitting in my own garbage. So I curbed my Ethiopian craving and resorted to a salad.  Good thing I didn't dine in. All that greasiness would have been hidden by the heat and soaked into the injera. I'm already well oiled, thank you. I don't need any gallstones."}
{"text":"*Edit* I just spoke the manager of the restaurant and he apologized for the mistake and told me I was simply given the wrong bill, and offered us a full refund."}
{"text":"Their food is incredible and the service excellent! I brought three friends and we all ordered an appetizer of sambuzas their $20 vegetarian plate which was plenty of food for everyone to share and an exciting variety to experiment with if you are not very familiar with Ethiopian cuisine like we were. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"First time having Ethiopian.  A group of 7 of us shared the sampler platter and it was amazing.  Lamb, spicy beef, chicken, sauteed beef, three different kinds of lentils.  It was all wonderful.  I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"We are so happy to find this Ethiopian place.  Delicious!  Gets better every time we go.  The owners are always willing to assist through ordering and explaining the food!"}
{"text":"I never thought I'd try this type of cuisine because it wasn't avoidable in most cities I've lived. Im glad i did. The service was polite and fast. The food was very good. I like not using utensils, similar to Indian cuisine. My favorite dish is the Key Wat. Tasty."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful! The food was amazing and our party of four split a veggie combo and a meat combo and couldn't finish it all. We brought home a huge carry out box full of food. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"The three meat and veggie combo was nice and pretty filling for one person. Very friendly service."}
{"text":"So this place was awesome.  It's been a while since I've eaten Ethiopian, and every time I eat it I wonder why I let anything get in between me and this delicious cuisine.  My favorite thing about Ethiopian, aside from the communal dining style, is the intentional and delicious vegetarian options.  We ordered a vegetarian combination (the Abyssinian Vegetarian) and a meat dish.  For four hungry adults we cashed out at about $40.  I also had the Ethiopian tea, which was new to me, and not a favorite, but glad I tried it nonetheless.  Now, while the food was good, the service was exceptional.  One in our party has a strong gluten intolerance.  He called ahead and the restaurant made a special gluten free injera for him.  Once we had arrived and ordered, they brought out and explained the unique injera they had prepared, no extra cost.  They also indicated that, given more advance notice (a few days) they'd be able to prepare it another way...maybe better?  I wasn't clear on the distinctions.  Still, they were very accommodating.  They also helped us decide on what menu items to order.  I hope to return here.  I was very pleased.  Unlike the two-star reviews left for Abyssinia, we were well fed and satisfied."}
{"text":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place.  Can't recommend highly enough. The food is absolutely delicious. My favorite is the vegetarian platter, a sampler of all their veggie options and the injera bread is a perfect compliment.  Husband and wife team couldn't be any friendlier. Wife does the cooking and he is the front of the store. Recommend to anyone looking for authentic Ethiopian food should put this on their short list!"}
{"text":"My Amhara boyfriend and myself were in PHX for his birthday weekend.  We decided to try local Ethio  restaurants and came across Abyssinia.  We reviewed the Yelp comments and suggestions, then made the decision to try Abyssinia (despite some comments regarding over charging customers).    Well, we were no exception to being over charged. After our experience, I now understand why the restaurant was completely empty on a Friday night. To be honest our experience wasn't all bad.  Service was pleasant and the atmosphere was nice.  The food was tasty and better as leftovers (the seasonings set). Would we go back No...  I feel like we were hustled.  Dinner for two came out to be $104.  Please be advised that they charge extra for Signature tray meat substitutions and for additional Enjara pieces (they only gave us 2 pieces each with the signature tray).  And we were never advised about all of the extra charges.  Here in Los Angeles, we would have paid half the price for our entire dinner."}
{"text":"What a great little place. The seating was a little cramped on a Saturday night but we were seated quickly. The food was good but I wouldn't necessarily call it super fresh. I've had better but to be fair, not in Phoenix. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We love Abyssinia. Their mission is food. Its tasty, prepared with love, and not overpriced.  Try the Abyssinia Combo and the honey wine. Or if you have a late night study party do the coffee ceremony. You need a few people and to call ahead and let them know, but its totally worth it. Sometimes they have the authentic Ethiopian dance showing on the tv, and you almost feel like you could be in Ethiopia."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I came in to try real authentic Ethiopian food for the FIRST TIME. We're pretty adventurous when it comes to food so this wasn't too crazy. The waiter was so super nice when we told him this was our first time. He brought us this appetizer which was heavenly. It was fried with lentils in it. Sooooo delicious. Then came our dish which had spicy beef and chicken with homemade cheese. The bread and everything was very different from what we've ever had but so yummy. The food was a little spicy but we love it that way since we're Armenian (we eat spicy as well!!) GREAT authentic food and the waiter was more than kind. We'll be coming back again!!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful surprise. And this is the best Ethiopian food you'll find in Arizona. It is a new family owned business, that is a real gem. The family, being from Ethiopia, found no real Ethiopian food in the valley, and thus opened Abyssinia Ethiopian Restaurant.  I found it because they currently are on restaurant.com. I did some research and realized how wonderful this place is. It's in a simple strip mall, a place you would not even notice if you were not heading there.  This is not fast food, they made everything we ordered to order. And if you are up to it, they serve like you would get at their home- no plates, or silverware. Eating with your hands with that wonderful Inerja bread adds to the whole experience. By the time we left the restaurant was relatively full, Filled with lots of neighbors who also probably grew up in Ethiopia. I love to support local businesses and especially family owned businesses. Give this one a chance"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE ethiopian food. I'd visited this restaurant in the fall when I was scouting places to live in AZ and now that I moved here I will certainly be a regular of this place. The service is attentive, friendly and very helpful. The food, well I found it hard not to lick my fingers, you get the picture! I don't eat meat and there are so many options here, I love it. I shared the vegetarian platter with my GF and we still had enough to bring home some leftovers for the next day (I love leftovers!) For starters we ordered their Sambusas which were absolutely perfect! A little spicy for me personally but I love the flavors so much. Can't wait to come back w/friends and family and introduce them to some really good, authentic Ethiopian food."}
{"text":"Tonight the Jolly diners went for Ethiopian cuisine. For starters we had a salad which was very fresh and very good. We then had tikel Gomen, and some kind of a beef dish for my sister and mother. All was served with injera bread. All of the dishes were well-prepared, well served, inexpensive, and delicious! The Jolly diners rated this restaurant at a 5 out of 5 stars. It has ambient Ethiopian music, good service, and great food at a reasonable price. It's a good place to take a date or have a nice family outing to experience delicious food from another culture."}
{"text":"I went in today w/ my brother. My brother and I had the vegan plate, no meat, no dairy, no animal byproducts whatsoever. It was exactly what I wanted. The plate was big and it was perfect for two people the share. The bread is called teff that's has been in Ethiopia for over 3,00 years (the server informed us). He also informed us that it was high in fiber and iron. I also did some research and found that it was very high in protein as well. I love that they have vegan options, that they use olive oil, and that the customer service was excellent. Also, for the gluten-free lifestyle, they can certainly accommodate toC starting w/ teff."}
{"text":"Food was good. I went there because they say their injera is gluten free. When I asked what it was made from, I'm told \"barley\". Yikes. Im glad I asked. I avoided the injera cause I'm gluten intolerant but its concerning that they don't know what gluten is and they advertise gluten free options."}
{"text":"Fantastic Ethiopian restaurant. I've spent some time in Ethiopia, and this is the genuine article. Clean and calming ambiance. I encourage people looking for new eats to check this place out."}
{"text":"It was really great that I found this place on eat 24. I really missed some good East African home cooking. While stuck at work and needing some food I discovered this place what a gem. They had a really great veggie platter it was a sample or so still a lot of food it was only 15.99 what a steal! I don't know the Amharic names well but the Tigrinya ones I know. The Alicha and Bersin was my favorite!!! The injera was the best!!!   It isn't grandmas cooking but it's delicious."}
{"text":"Food was AMAZING! Home cooking at its finest! Joshua and his wife are extremely kind, gracious, and generous.  We will be back soon."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful and quaint neighborhood restaurant. My husband and I dined several times here since it opened and have been nothing but impressed by the friendly staff and great menu recommendations! The vegetarian combo platter is HUGE and delicious. Perfect way to sample a variety of flavor. We have also tried several of the meat dishes and all were delicious and so flavorful. The injera is freshly made and wonderful as well. We come home with a heap of leftovers every time! This place is so welcomed to our neighborhood--I encourage everyone to try it out!"}
{"text":"By far one of the best Ethiopian food in the state! So good, I just the perfect slice of home"}
{"text":"Great Ethiopian food.  I ordered the combination platter which was a huge portion of food for the money.  Easy way to feed a large group and not have to spend too much time ordering."}
{"text":"I was a little wary of this place, given that I came here on a rainy night and there was no one here besides my party, but it turned out to be very good! The place isn't much to look at, a small storefront in a fairly dead plaza. They have a big TV on the counter (very old school). I came with my dad and step mom and we ordered two things to share, the vegetarian sampler and the fim tibs. We weren't sure if this would be enough, but we ended up having leftovers! The vegetarian plate was good, there were many different items on the plate, and, honestly, I don't know what many of them were, but they were all tasty. The fim tibs (beef with onion and jalapeno) was ridiculously tasty. It was served in this contraption that had a fire inside, keeping the beef and veggies sizzling hot for the whole meal! The beef was so frickin tasty, I want some more right now. They also gave us some spicy powder... add that to the mix and you're set. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I don't have Ethiopian food often, but this was one of the best experiences I ever had. I ordered the aterkik alicha (split yellow peas on onion, garlic and olive oil) and the other person in my party ordered tickle gomen (curried veggie stew with onions and carrots). They were both really good, served on top of fresh injera, but we both agreed that the aterkik alicha was better because the soft, saucy consistency mixed better with the injera. Overall, it was really fresh, tasty and satisfying to put in the 95th percentile of great meals I have had. To make it even better, the service was some of the best I ever received, and made an already great experience unforgettable. Even if you have never had Ethiopian food, you need to try this place out, and once you get used to grabbing the food with your hands with the bread, it isn't that odd, and is a great thing to try, especially in an establishment as good as this"}

{"text":"FAN-FREAKING-TASTIC! We drove from Scottsdale to try this place and it was completely worth the drive. We ordered a sampler platter that was $40 and had a taste of everything, my family of 4 devoured it and it filled us all up. Great flavors, fabulous variety, very nice staff too. We followed up with baklava (the best I have ever had in my life) and tiramisu for dessert. Try the Ethiopian coffee...delicious!  I plan to be back. Loved it."}
