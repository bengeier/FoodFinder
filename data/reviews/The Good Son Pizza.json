{"text":"Authentic AND delicious pizza. Friendly service. It's a must try. I'll have to check out the restaurant on Queen street."}
{"text":"In my personal opinion, I feel like the pizza game in TO right now is booming, there's a pizza place every corner you turn, with new ones coming up every week. Wood-fired, unlimited toppings, thin crust etc. are things easily found for Torontonians. So naturally, I've delved deeply and tried my fair share of Toronto's pizza offerings. When I went to lunch at Assembly on a Friday afternoon, I knew getting pizza from Good Son would be good, son! (hehe)   We got there around 12 and somehow, magically, there was no line up at Good Son. I rushed over and placed my order for the eggplant ricotta pie. Turns out there was still a long queue of orders there.. people had just ordered and left to go wander around while their pizzas were being made. Either way, the wait wasn't too bad, I got my pizza in 5 minutes.   Finding a seat at Assembly is a struggle. If you can find a seat, you're one of the lucky ones. If not, think of an alternate location in advance so you can walk over before your food gets cold.   The pizza was delicious, and actually much bigger than I thought it was going to be. The toppings were generous and the crust was thin yet not too thin where it was soggy with the sauce. It held up well and didn't get hard as the pizza cooled. Ate about half at lunch time and saved the rest for a mid-afternoon snack back at work. It was tasty even after it got cold, the true test of good pizza. They also accommodate food restrictions easily. My friend had a dairy allergy and they swapped out ingredients on her pizza.  I know the Good Son also does a Margherita that looks amazing as well, definitely trying that the next time I go."}
{"text":"I had the chance to share a Margherita pizza with friends. We each got something from different vendors. The crust was nice and crispy and the toppings were distributed evenly. Overall, it was a well made tasty pizza. I would definitely order another."}
{"text":"I have never been to The Good Son's original Queen Street West location and this is the first time I have a taste of what they offers at this Assembly Chef's Hall.  We shared   Spicy Sopressata ($18) ~ Anaheim Chili, Sun Dried Olives  As the pizza is hand-tossed and made-to-order, it did take 10-15 minute for our pizza to be ready even when the place was not too busy. Make sure you are not in a rush to get back to work.  Pizza has a nice thin charred crust. A little bit of spiciness from chili and a little bit of savory from olives.  Perfect for sharing. Or of course you can eat that pie and called it a happy meal.  Selection here though limited to pizza but I hope there will be some other options in the future."}
