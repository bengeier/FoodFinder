{"text":"I was recently told about this place from a client. First, I was a little hesitant, but my coworkers and I decided to give it a try. We made reservations, and upon arrival I was glad we did. It was extremely crowded. The location is pretty small and very tight between tables, but the vibe was nice. We order a little of everything on the menu, the po boy, oysters, shrimp, and crab legs. The wait for the food was a little long, but I'm pretty sure it's because it was a busy Saturday night. My crabs legs were pretty good, and my coworkers liked what they had too. Unfortunately, the oysters never came out. Maybe the waitress had forgotten.. oh wells.. but by the time we remembered, we were actually full. Not a great loss. The best thing was the \"Cajun sauce\" I had gotten with my crab legs.. it was what made it over the top for me... good experience :)"}
{"text":"Very bad service all the way around they didn't want to give us our potato and corn that came with our meal. They served us unclean shrimps that had veins and feces in them still. We were very unhappy we talked to the head cook and was told that how they serve the shrimp."}
{"text":"My husband and I always crave for seafood boils. We have ordered takeout from here quite a few times. It's an hour away from our house but for great food we will travel. Lol... wish they had one closer! We always get the house sauce with medium spice. Yumm Yumm delish!!!! I'm craving for some now as I right this review!!!"}
{"text":"The music they play in here is booming. But the food smells like a Chinese buffet on a bad day the food is not bad nothing like New Orleans Seafood but not bad for Cleveland I do not recommend the Cajun sauce it tasted to sweet nothing like real Cajun sauce but the food was decent."}
{"text":"The food was really good but our service was not so. She was a bit clueless to our needs and ruined our experience. I would come back only if was not seated in her area."}
{"text":"This restaurant is truly a hole in the wall.  The paper towels had stains on them.  I ordered the catfish and the breading was super spicy and the fish was not fresh.  They don't serve tarter sauce. The coleslaw was too sweet and looked like it had been sitting around all day.  I requested the items be removed from the bill.  The so-called manager was rude and nasty but agreed to only charge me half the price.  I would never recommend eating at this place.. super gross..   Bd.......Atlanta GA"}
{"text":"Hubby and I love Cajun seafood crawl and was delighted to see Boiling Seafood Crawfish in Cleveland. We order an order of wings to start, 2 lbs of crawfish, 1 lb of clams, and 1 lb of snow crab legs. Ahhhh, it was an enjoyable meal. They gave us a lot for 2 lbs of crawfish and towards the very end it was hard for us to finish it. The sauces were very tasteful although it was a bit thick or just not enough sauce in each bag. We were hoping for more sauce. The staffs were friendly and accommodating as we requesting all sort of items such as lime, salt & pepper, crackers, scissor, and change to put in the parking meters. However, they were all so nice to accommodate all our needs and we were pleased they didn't get irritated. Definitely a must go place for a Cajun crawl in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Terrible food. The worst restaurant I've ever seen. Using died crabs and shrimps to cook. The crabs and shrimps must have died long time before cooked. Crab taste like clay. Not recommend at all. Will never try again!!!!!"}
{"text":"I tried the \"Ultimate\" with \"Homemade juicy\" medium spice.   It was soooo good!!!   We have told so many of our friends about this place.  Great food and great service!    We have been twice with in the past two weeks!!!  The Cajun calamari, soft shell crab appetizer with fries...delish!!! If you love fresh seafood with New Orleans spice... This is a must try!!    Reminds  me of Karai Crab restaurant in Hawaii!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I both had the lobster tail dinner entree. Very nicely seasoned steaming hot lobster with steamed assorted cooked vegetables. Very tasty and reasonably priced with a no nonsense clean milieu. Disposable paper table cloths and paper towels if you get messy. We did not. We will be back and maybe get the \"temptations by the pound\" of crab or shrimp. Ours was the less messy version. This is a great new find in the area."}
{"text":"If u r expecting live crabs or shrimps for your order, NEVER  NEVER GO TO THIS RESTAURANT. Crab is tasted like crap and shrimps must have been dead for ever long. NEVER"}
{"text":"I love seafood and this was right up my alley. Great to have in the neighborhood. I really like the fact you can add different spices it gives us a taste of New Orleans in the Heights."}
{"text":"This place is pretty solid.  If you like Hot n' Juicy in Vegas then this place is for you.  Don't wear your good shirt/pants here, you may get messy.  I ordered the shrimp in spicy garlic (the middle of the spice scale)  It was pretty spicy, I sweat a little, but I like to feel the burn.  Waitress was attentive."}
{"text":"It's really good. However, it's a little oily. And there is no way to get ride of the oil. Also, they should clean the black line at the back of shrimps."}
{"text":"Fantastic! I always wished for a cajun-style seafood boil in Cleveland, so you can imagine how excited I was when I heard about this place! The seafood is fresh, the sauce (homemade juicy) is delicious, and the service is very quick."}
{"text":"A friend told me this was his go-to place since it opened so I finally had a chance to stop by.  This was a mistake.    Just getting a clam basket (just a few super-heavily breaded bits of clam) and some droopy fries was $12!  (see the pic)  WAYYY too expensive for just a little food.  I also tried the wings and 8 wings means 8 sections.  Not bad but not a BUCK each for half a wing.  (see OTHER pic)  They had some sort of chopped vegetable relish stuff with them but I don't even know what they were going for.  I went in to order, lots of people sitting around waiting,  came back to pick up my order, many of the same people still waiting.  This is Cleveland Heights, you are paying to park and woe unto you if you are late with the quarters.  PLUS - a regular fountain Dr. Pepper was 3 BUCKS.  Not posted or listed on the menu.  At least the woman who rang me up had the decency to look embarrassed when I verified it with her.  Get over yourselves, this place is not that good and too overpriced for the quality and portions of food."}
{"text":"The food is great and served in a reasonable amount of time. The portions are filling. The place is clean (bathroom included). The people are friendly. I didn't give them 5-stars because they seem to be having a little difficulty handling the business. My friend had to seat two of their parties. Nothing an extra person on payroll couldn't handle."}
{"text":"Very fresh product. Clear enviroment. Nice service. Recommend shrimp?exellent experience."}
{"text":"I'm happy that cleveland has this kinda of crawfish! The place is a bit small but the taste worth going. Go with the home made source specifically prepared by the owner. I can tell they selected their seafood carefully. The shrimps, crab legs, clams are fresh. If you are not sure what to order, go with the handful or ultimate. Appetizers are great too."}
{"text":"I am from Houston and this place is crazy food crawfish Food was really bad crawfish was overcooked with the shrimp fresh oysters was very very small I don't know how this place has a good review the place is really really bad I will never recommend to anyone service is ok but food is really not worth it that money it's just waiste of money!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Similar to BoilingCrab, but not as good. But unfortunately, there's no other place that's better in Cleveland.  I do recommend getting their fries and shrimp! (Crawfish was NOT my fav)"}
{"text":"Yes, yes, yes!!!   I am a seafood enthusiast. I have been all my life. I've had blue crabs right on the Chesapeake and crawfish in the French Quarter. I think that isn't a slight disservice to fry seafood because it is near perfect on its own.   If you feel the same way, get to this place now. Like, yesterday really. It has become my new obsession. Don't go in expecting to stay clean or eat with a fork. Come in ready to get messy and enjoy yourself.   I got the Handful with the Juicy Cajun at the mild spice level and am I ever glad I did. It had quite the kick to it! Still very good I just had to keep the water handy. If you're a spice wuss be very cautious.   Can't wait to go back here. So glad a place like this exists in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"After reading positive reviews, I was excited to try this restaurant. However, I was disappointed with every aspect of the meal. The ambience matched the quality of food.....terrible.   Upon entering, we were welcomed by seeing 4-6 tables of people. Each table looked like it was covered in vomit. Turns out that was the shrapnel from the food, but was foreshadowing of our meal.   We ordered the \"get your feet wet combo\", which was like turd in a bag sprinkled with hot sauce. Eating with plastic gloves on is not my ideal Friday night plan, but was probably the only saving grace as it was the only thing between my hands and the un-deveined shrimp poop chute."}
{"text":"Awesome food!! Best crawfish and seafood joint in the area! Get the homemade sauce, medium is a good level of spice. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"The boiling seafood is amazing as always! The shrimp is fresh and everything about the place is amazing. The fried foods have an amazing taste and so does the sauce. The sauce is amazing, I would recommend the homemade juicy, it is a combination of everything!! The service is amazing, the employees are so friendly and the food is even better. The seafood is so fresh, and the crab legs is thick and juicy.   Now if you get the boiled, they give you bibs and gloves so you don't get messy . There is no place like this in Ohio, it's a fun experience and i recommend everyone to come try it out!!"}
{"text":"The shrimp po' boys are juicy, the shrimp is large, and the sauce has just a bit of kick to it! Very fresh and tasty. Not as Cajun as I would have thought but still good."}
{"text":"I loved this place it's the Joes Crab Shack of Cleveland Heights. If you love seafood and good seafood at that then you will enjoy this place. It can get messy if you take it home so I suggest you put down a towel or eat it out of a really big bowl."}
{"text":"Five Stars for everything - service, location, food!  Went here today to have our post wedding anniversary dinner with my family and it didn't disappoint. The food was amazing. We had the ultimate with all 4 seasoning in medium spicy. Me and my husband love food and as a tropical girl (Philippines) growing up with fresh seafood I can tell everything we had was fresh. My son who loves calamari kept saying it was the most tender he had since we arrived in Cleveland.   Our server Joanna is awesome, though she can use a smile more often - she kind of have that \"resting b face\" but she's friendly and knowledgable with what this restaurant has to offer.   If you don't mind getting messy on a date with great food served on the table, come try this place - you will never regret it.   Oh! The only thing we had having a hard time eating was crawfish - our first time to try it, there must be a trick on how to crack and get the meat.   All in all - great experience and can't wait to go back and try the ultimate with blue crabs."}
{"text":"Loved!!!  Best meal I've had all month.  We had the shrimp, mussels and crab legs.  Super messy and so hot I thought my fingers would blister but it was delicious and fresh.    We also had those little fried balls of corn for an appetizer- also good but could use a more flavorful dipping sauce.    Going back for sure."}
{"text":"Went there on a Thursday. Have the place all to ourselves. Started off with raw chuckled oysters. It was tasteless so it wasn't fresh. Than ordered  blue crabs, crayfish, clams, potatoes and corn with garlic butter seasoning it was delicious  but a little too over priced to me."}
{"text":"This place is unique in Cleveland and a welcomed addition in my opinion. Gather a group of friends and head on over to this unassuming restaurant for a fun experience. Leave the watches and jewelry at home folks, cause it's about to get messy! You can get a prearranged bag or you can venture off and create your own grab bag of meat, veggies and Cajun spices. Get the homemade juicy, it's a combo of all the seasonings offered. The shrimp are probably my favorite but the lobster tails are a decent size and the fresh crayfish are meaty (if your into all that). The potato is the perfect component to sop up the Cajun spice and juices, just crack one and let it sit in that sauce. The sausage and corn also goes well in the bag. The clams a small and inconsequential, I've only had them once and have passed since. Watch the spice level, it gets hot really easily!   Did I mention it's messy? They give you these terribly loose gloves and a nice bin that they'll tie for you to use instead of utensils and give you a covered table to go wild. Be sure to wash your hands once your done, the spice can be overwhelming."}
{"text":"Only negative thing was the place was very hot. Not sure if ac wasn't on or what but was very warm. But let's get to the important stuff, the food. I got 1lb snow crab, 1lb of king crab, a corn & a potato. It was all great. The sauce that came on was very flavorful & had just the right kick(I had med). The service was good & the server was very nice. The price was ok. Not like you're going to find cheap King crab any where.  I will be back. Good job..."}
{"text":"Small casual restaurant. I ordered 1/2 of shrimp and deep fried soft shell crab. Both were delicious. Only negative comment is that since they don't de-shell the shrimps they can't devein them so you end up eating the guts. Overall, it was a fun experience."}
{"text":"Do do DO NOT!! overlook this joint! At best it has unassuming decor and ambiance. At worst it is kind of a hole in the wall (but not dirty). Cast all of your aesthetic expectations aside! Maybe not the greatest place to bring a blind date, or anyone looking for a formal meal. But, If you have an appetite for seafood, this is the place for you. The prices are that of a grocery store. Don't look for frills though, as your food is delivered to your table in plastic bags. IE no plates. Your seafood is tossed in your choice of sauce. Don't worry though, they have plastic gloves for your delicate little fingers."}
{"text":"Good place to have fun with friends. But if you are a picky seafood lover, you might not like. Service is good, environment is good, crawfish is good, crab is...almost. But the shrimps, although big size, are not that fresh because the texture is a little soft. I love Cajun style but it's not exactly the same Cajun."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our experience at the Boiling Seafood, but we were disappointed in prices. My husband and I fairly easily consumed the Ultimate together, when it was supposed to be more for 3-4 people. With what was offered, the cost, and both of us leaving without a completely full stomach, we both agreed that we probably would not be returning.   If you're looking for a cool experience, a **great** music playlist, and decent food, I'd check it out!"}
{"text":"I couldn't resist.  It's a new place in the neighborhood, I had to try it.  I went there for lunch on Friday.  The decor was typical.   Pictures of sea creatures and nets on the wall.  The lady at the counter was super nice and helpful.  Prices were slightly on the high side.  Ok, let's get to the food.  It was lunch time so I didn't get the seafood boil- too messy and  I had things to do.  I got a hodge podge of food.  The corn fritters were great.  The kids loved them.   It was deep fried sweet corn dough- enough said.  You really don't even need the runny ranch sauce that it was served with.  The Shrimp Po'Boy with sweet potato fries were really good.  Unfortunately the Crawfish Etouffée was disappointing . I love Étouffée but there was something different about this one.  The roux was really light in color and it had a really fishy smell and taste.  I had a couple of bites and threw out the rest. I think I got spoiled by Junior's restaurant, Battiste & Dupree, down the street.  I will definite try this place again.   It's only been open for a week or two.   Next time, I'm hoping to try their seafood broil."}
{"text":"Finally a Cajun-style boiling seafood in Cleveland! The crawfish, shrimp and crab legs are extremely fresh. The secret homemade sauce is full of favors, well balanced. We did medium spicy. Not enough for us lol."}
{"text":"Food was great when we finally got it. Service was horrendous. First, after a very long wait, they brought the wrong order, then after about 30 minutes more they brought some of our order. We had to ask twice to get the rest of the order that they had somehow forgotten about. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Loved this place. I visited a place like this in Vegas. You order boiled seafood by the pound with your desired spice level (mild was spicy to me). The tables are covered with paper for easy clean up then they give you a bib, gloves & a bag of steaming hot seafood.   We ordered the \"handful\" with large head on shrimp, clams, sausage & crawfish. Order extra potatoes & corn upfront you'll need it. I had fresh shucked oysters. I heard the crab was good too. They offer fried seafood. Prices are on point.   The place is McDonalds casual and they just got their liquor license too. You'll enjoy it."}
{"text":"Great place to satisfy a Cajun seafood craze. Prices are reasonable as well. I came back for a second time! Place isn't too busy which is great as far as service. Staff was always generous to refill water without needing to be asked."}
{"text":"Actual review: 3.5 stars   This small seafood place is almost a hole in the wall eatery, since most seafood places in Cleveland seem to be by the Flats. We waited about 45 minutes to get our seafood - luckily we ordered sweet potato fries as a starter. Everything just seemed to take so long, from waiting to order to getting our food to waiting for our cards after we paid. The clams were mostly empty shells too. However, the seasonings were amazing!!! Their homemade juicy sauce is a mix of all of the Cajun, lemon pepper, and garlic butter. We got the clams with garlic butter, mussels with lemon pepper, and crawfish with the homemade juicy seasoning. Our of the three, the mussels were definitely the best and most worth the money. Very messy, the they have the bib and gloves. Don't wear your Sunday best though.   Now we know, so I hope to visit again with an updated review! Looking forward to some mussels and shrimp slathered with their flavorful seasonings."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE. I will never eat here again. The shrimp was not deveined. On the Menu it says \"for every pound of shrimp, you get one potato and one corn.\" When I got my food I only the shrimp. I told the server I was missing my corn and potato. The server said \" I didn't ask for the potato and corn\", but on the menu it says it comes with one potato and one corn. I didn't know I was supposed to ask for the items that came with the meal."}
{"text":"4.5! This place is LEGIT!  I've been telling all my friends about this place. Luckily, Cedar Lee is my neighborhood now.  It's essentially like the LA-based Boiling Crab restaurants with Cajun seafood! I definitely recommend getting the \"The Experiences\" - either the Handful or the Ultimate, which are the quintessential cajun boiling crab orders! The Handful comes with 1 lb of crawfish, 1 lb shrimp, a dozen andouille sausage pieces, and 1/2 of clams with 2 corn and 2 potatoes. The Ultimate is the same but it comes with 1/2 of snow crab legs and cajun calamari. You can also order pounds of seafood a la carte. It comes in a giant plastic bag mixed with the spices, and you dump it on the table or just grab it with your hands (with plastic gloves and bib.) Classic!!    We got the Ultimate along with extra corn, Hawaiian bread, cajun fries, and rice and shared it among 4 people. Our choice of spices for the Ultimate: ALL THE SPICES! with a 3 out of 5 pepper spiciness rating. It definitely had a kick and it was perfect. I'm iffy about shrimp that's old but this was very fresh and tender. Another favorite was the potato, which soaked in all the spices at the bottom.   Next time, we'll go for the Handful with the a la carte seafood, like blue crab with more potatoes, Hawaiian bread and extra corn. We didn't care much for the cajun fries and the breaded calamari.   I was pleasantly surprised when I went and was greeted by an Asian owner or manager! This place is probably one of the most diverse restaurants on the Cedar Lee strip. We loved our experience there and can't wait to come back. It was plenty busy on a Friday night, which was great to see. It's one of Cedar Lee's best kept secrets that I hope doesn't get out too quickly!"}
{"text":"I was so happy to find a place like this in Ohio! The food was great and fresh! My boyfriend and I ordered crawfish, crab, and mussels. Everything was cooked to perfection! The homemade juicy sauce was amazing the medium was very spicy to us I would recommend mild but still the food was great! And I forgot to mention how good the prices were! We will definitely be coming back here again!!"}
{"text":"Fun place to eat. Seafood tastes fairly fresh. Decent prices. Glad there's a place like this in Cleveland"}
{"text":"My friends and I were super excited to try this place as we love seafood. There was five of us and we were visiting from Indiana and Kentucky and couldn't wait to eat here. When we got there, it was a little busy and the hostess mentioned that there was a party of 20 coming, so they didn't have any tables. I asked her that's fine we will wait. She told us that they were no longer seating parties of 5 tonight, when I heard that, I asked her to repeat. (Are you no longer just seating parties of 5 or 5+? And why would you not? Money is money. I've never heard of a restaurant doing this) The party of 20 ends up telling her to just pull up another 2 top table to them and they will release the other tables. So we thank them and eventually get sat at the remaining tables left (2 tables pushed together). As we are looking at the menu, the hostess tells us she is going to seperate our table and just add a chair to the end. Slightly rude considering a meal like this takes a lot of space. When we are finally greeted by our server, she is great! Food comes out perfect and we are just the happiest people. As I enjoy my meal, I notice that some tables open up and in walks another group of 6+ that get seated right away, no hesitation. So much for not seating parties of 5 anymore tonight. I did not enjoy my experience walking in, but our server and the food was excellent!"}
{"text":"This place is surprisingly really good! The premise is that you order a bunch of seafood and it comes served in a bag so that the spice mix it is served with can be evenly distributed. It is a fun place to go to with a group of friends because the bags of food are quite large (and can get expensive!).   The restaurant supplies you with shell crackers, bibs and gloves, and rolls of paper towels at the tables. I'd recommend maybe even bringing some additional wet wipes because your hands will get messy regardless!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  It's very laid back in that there's paper on the tables and you eat your food from a bag. Great if you want to hunker down with some one and watch each other eat like a true slob, I loved it!  They have a few different types of sauces; Cajun, garlic and house sauce which is a mixture of the two, and three levels of spicy; mild, medium and hot. We ordered the mild for the wimp I was with and I got a side of medium.  Even the mild has a kick to it, maybe I'm a little wimpy too?  Our bag had shrimp, crawfish and clams.  There were potatoes and a couple corn cobs in there as well.  We also got a side of hush puppies which were crispy and dark brown.  There were so many shrimp in that bag!  It was awesome, my lips were numb and fingertips red despite the gloves by the end of the meal.    There's a small selection of beers, which go great with the spice.  You do have to make peace with making the bottle sticky between sips.  Needless to say, do not wear your finest when coming here.  I would say it's a great spot to loosen up if you're getting to know a person and whether or not they're uptight/if they find you attractive with stuff on your face."}
{"text":"This is my very first time posting a review. My husband and I were looking for a place to try Crawfish. We were skeptical at first especially after reviewing the negative reviews on this site but we took a chance and went to this place. We are so happy that we went!!! The food is amazing!! It is a little on the pricey side but you do get your money's worth!!! I ordered \"The handful\" boil which included Crawfish, shrimp, sausage, clams, potatoes and corn....what a feast!! Both my son and I shared this dish and had plenty to bring home!! My husband ordered 2lbs of Crawfish and he still savored the leftovers after we got home...lol!! The flavors are amazing but just be careful because the heat is real!!! I ordered the garlic butter with mild heat which was perfect with the right amount of spice. My husband had \"The house\" sauce with medium spice....although it did make him sweat, he still enjoyed his meal!! I really don't understand those negative reviews...this little spot is a hidden Jen of the south!!!"}
{"text":"Sitting in the boiling seafood and crawfish and I am STUFFED! The crab legs with the homemade juicy sauce was amazing. We also got a lobster po boy and it was so crispy and the sauce was perfect. I love everything about this place, our waiter was attentive and asked how we liked the food and held a conversation with us about our experience. The playlist was even dope! Great dining experience. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is a tale of two cities. At Boiling Seafood there are good and not so good results.  Good: fried oysters, Shrimp Po Boy Bad: Crayfish Etoufee   The Louisiana staple was white watery and like nothing we've ever sampled before. It is unfortunate the little mud-suckers had to die for this.   The oyster were fresh, full of spice and the po boy was also well spiced and a nice bite.   Will we go back? Yes, but great care must be taken when ordering."}
{"text":"Getting my Cajun kick on!!! A must try if you live on the east side of Cleveland!!! Great little hole in the wall. If you love Louisiana Cajun this is your spot!!"}
{"text":"Lesson 1 - if ordering the dungeness crab do not order anything else.  They steam it way too long and our shrimp, corn, and potatoes were different degrees of mush.  But you give it 4 stars? Yes! Head on shrimp is not easy to find in ohio... yes, it is not cleaned... that is the trade off for the sweetness and moisture of head on cooking... you have to clean it yourself as the customer.  These folk did not come up with thus cooking method... travel to Baltimore or New Orleans... you will get the same not cleaned shrimp.  Lesson 2 - their idea of hot is Thai based... we were dripping in sweat and dreaming of milk with only 2 stars.    Homemade Juicy = all 3 seasonings together. .. cajun, lemon pepper, garlic and herb... unfortunately the heat drown out the lemon and most of the garlic... the rosemary was delightful.  Lesson 3 - Pack your patience and your own seafood forks.  And a container of wet ones... next time we will skip the plastic gloves  Staff needs training... the bus boy and older Asian woman seemed to be the only ones on top of things.  $68 for 2 people... corn fritters, 1 order all in one bag (1 small dungeness, 1 lb shrimp, 2 corn, 2 potatoes), 2 soda   Crab legs at next table looked great... would get those next time... and there will be a next time."}
{"text":"Small and unexpected but really good. We got the experience. It is alot of food, but the seasoning is delicious. Service is really good too. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"The fried oysters were a 4, but the shrimp in the bag was a 5.  I am glad I only ordered a 1/2, because if I ordered 1lb, i would have ate the whole thing (it was that good)."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, service was Great. If you want a relaxed and fun place to eat this is the place for you."}
{"text":"The food is amazing!! My family really enjoyed the food and the drinks! This is a must go to place if you love seafood!"}
{"text":"We made a reservation for ten people on a Tuesday night with no hassle or wait. We were told they get busy on the weekends and we might not have had the same luck with a party of ten on a Saturday night. Excellent service.   We ordered and shared blue crabs with garlic butter sauce, black mussels with garlic butter sauce, crawfish with Cajun medium sauce (spicy), and whole shrimp (heads and all) with no sauce and lemon pepper sauce on the side.   Our kids appreciated having the sauce on the side for the shrimp.    Everything was superb, and messy.  From the fryer we ordered calamari, fried shrimp, and chicken tenders for the kids.  Sides of Hawaiian rolls were a nice addition along with corn on the cob and redskin potato.  Clean and well run.  Carry out is also available.  We will be back."}
{"text":"This place is sooooooo good. It's small but the food speak volumes. The hostess was sweet and friendly! She was very helpful even though she wasn't our waiter and I loved that. Our waiter was nice and attentive. But the food....the food was hot (temperature) the food was cooked on point. I'm a seafood lover. And this spot is for the seafood lovers with the southern flavor/twist! The homemade juice that goes in the boil bags are delicious. Definitely a must try. I traveled over an hour away and I wasn't disappointed, I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Overall: Good food, adequate service, small little cozy restaurant, reasonable to slightly overpriced seafood. Available lot parking a couple blocks away.  Food: Got The Handful for $31 for 2 people - has shrimp, crawfish, clams, sausages, 2 corns and 2 potatoes and was just enough for us. Also got fries on the side which were okay. Seasoning is great, spice level (mild) was not really spicy so would probably get medium next time. Happy with the meal but not the best seafood I've had  Service: Adequate. Not the best and they did mess up the bill and added something extra on accident but quickly corrected it.  Ambience: Small but cozy!  Price: Reasonable.  Parking: Street metered or parking lot metered about a couple of blocks away."}
{"text":"Fun sexy ambiance, but also messy for a date... If you are ready to have fun with a date and eat messy but extremely delicious food with your hands and wearing a bib, go!!! Because it's also got sort-of a sexy vibe, but paper covered tables and bibs and plastic gloves! It's a lol fun date place!  Go with a group of friends or family. Little expensive, but you get good seafood for the prices. I'm addicted!"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!!!! Great and quick service and the food is amazing! Spicy, Cajun & fresh food. I love that they serve it straight out of the bag and you get to dig in. We always look forward to a trip to this place."}
{"text":"It was everything I thought it to be. The crab legs were perfectly cooked for cracking, shrimp on point, and even the potatoes and corn were too delicious. I can't really tell you anything different from most of the reviews. I loved it. The place is small but tables open up quickly. My boyfriend and I share the ultimate and had shrimp and crawfish leftover.   I know the bib looks stupid, wear it anyway... I learned that the hard way."}
{"text":"So we came here on a whim.   Well, maybe not a whim but it definitely wasn't a part of the plan.  We always walked past putting it on our bucket list of places to try down Lee but you never got to it until now.  We just recently visited a similar concept over on Coventry and wanted to see how the two compared.  For starters, the size of the dining area.  If you like your elbow room, this is not the place for you.  Make sure you're visiting with a group you love because the small quarters will have you getting to know each other fairly quickly.  Again, this is in comparison to the place on Coventry.  Unlke the Coventry place, (oh, let's call it Newbie) we didn't have to wait forever for our food.  The food found its way, steaming hot, on to our table in less than a 15 minute wait once we ordered.  At both places, you get a bib and gloves to protect yourself whilst throwing down (aka eating) but I think I like Newbie's gloves a bit better for the materials you have to work with (i.e. lobster shells and such).  The flavors.  The flavors are hands down better here than at Newbie.  I got the lemon pepper and the house special flavors and loooooved both.  I highly recommend the house special flavor.  Watch your heat level if you don't like spicy.  The hospitality was great here.  I felt that I wasn't neglected and felt that my needs were met.  The prices are about the same at both places but for the better flavor, I would visit here again."}
{"text":"Came here on a date because I thought it would be a fun ice breaker to get a little messy, wear bibs, and have a hands on experience at dinner.   We went with the \"Ultimate Experience\" ($46) and got the mild sauce, but even that has a little bit of a kick/heat. Very tasty though, could pick up butter, garlic, and some sweetness. Lots of food so definitely plenty for 2-3 people. There were some potatoes, corn, crawfish, shrimp, sausages, clams, crab, and a side of cajun calamari.   My date barely ate anything and just stared at me like he was thinking about making a suit out of my skin, so yeah,  that was a bit awkward. We ended up splitting the bag into two for to-go and I just ate my dinner after my date in the comfort of my own home without scenes from the Silence of the Lambs movie playing in my head.   Oh, and staff was friendly and attentive. There is public parking right around the corner, just make sure you have some quarters! Meters run 24/7. I would recommend checking this place out! (Ripping the crawfish apart was a bit disturbing, but whatevs, it was good)."}
{"text":"This is the best seafood place.Shrimps are big and sweet. Crawfish and blue crabs are clean and fresh.  I love it."}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped in on a Saturday afternoon for lunch. This place doesn't look like much from the outside, but the food was phenomenal! We started with the fried corn fritters. They are crunchy on the outside and sweet and soft on the inside. Highly recommend. We shared the \"experience\". It was the perfect amount of food for 2 people. We liked that we got to pick our spice level and sauce. They provide you with paper towels, bibs, gloves, and a dump bucket for all the shells. It's such a fun and unique restaurant. And the prices are very reasonable. I'm looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"A small place on Lee Road across from Lopez and next to the Kabob place.  It was a small Chinese takeout place that has been redone with a modern decor; dark walls with pictures of cooked seafood.  The tables have white paper coverings and a roll of paper towels.  A little crystal chandelier is nice, but seems out of place.   I stopped for lunch; had the fried crayfish po-boy sandwich.  You get a nicely toasted roll with a nice sized helping of nicely fried crayfish, shredded lettuce, tomatoes and a nice zippy remoulade  sauce.  Comes with a big helping of fries and a large fountain drink for $10.  The sandwich was excellent, with the spicy sauce setting off the seafood nicely.  The fries were crisp and had a bit of seasoning, but nothing to write home about.  Overall this has huge potential, we need a place you can get some good simple seafood.  I will be going back and trying some of the other items."}
{"text":"My first and last experience with this restaurant was horrible. I paid $48 for the ultimate bag and received a bag full of unsanitary food to feed my family. The shrimps weren't cleaned and still had the legs, tail, head and eyes. The crawfish was disgusting, the clams were not cleaned and were slimmy, the  calamari seemed to be good until I came on huge tentacles that the breading had come off. I feel that many of the views and rating are misleading on this restaurant unless these people enjoy eating unsanity food. This restaurant is ripping people off and serving them actual sh!t in an bag. Don't waste your money!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out with some friends not too long ago and I must say its now one of my favorite seafood places in Cleveland. The setup is fairly simple. You pick your seafood choice from the menu and then you select your seasoning and spice level. The seasonings I tried was incredible . And the spice level was perfect. I definitely. Recommend this spot."}
{"text":"The spicy crawfish is really good, it is authentic Chinese flavor. Strongly recommend"}
{"text":"I came and I left ordering only a soda, the waiter Lee was a total bust for my party,he had no hospitality skills I would ask a question he would jus say no like could I substitute the sausage cause I don't eat pork no just pick them out really, really,then I say well was the market price for the lobster today it on the board behind u\"note I said behind me\" I just went and paid for the drink I work hard for my money and I wasn't feeling him..."}
{"text":"It took me two tries to eat there. Even though the hours are listed until 11:00, if you come in after 10:30 you will be turned away. The door staff was ok at best. I came at 10:00 and they seemed to have a problem I decided to dine in. Nevertheless, the food was pretty good. I would go back to experience some more of the favors and options. I had the crawfish and the shrimp (comes with head on) during my first visit. The prices are good as well."}
{"text":"We went to boiling Seafood last night for my birthday seafood very feast homemade sauce  is good I will be back"}
{"text":"This. Place. Is. Incredible!  I'm pretty sure I ate my weight in craw dads and shrimp. I'm a southern girl, so I actually like the entire bodies. The craw dads brains taste like mustard and its epic when you put the meat from the in your mouth and suck the brains out. Don't judge me!  Service was awesome and the food was so full flavor, my taste buds did a little happy dance. We will be back. 100% loved it!"}
{"text":"We got the ultimate. It was worth it! Ordered it for pick up and it was still hot and ready when we got home! This place never let us down. Great lil place to go and a gem in Cleveland area!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! A new Cleveland heights gem! Try the homemade juicy seasoning on your boil!"}
{"text":"My friends and I finally got to try this place out a few weeks back. We went on a chilly Thursday, so having a nice steaming bag of seafood for dinner sounded amazing to us. Now typically I don't like eating seafood during the weekdays because I worry it's not fresh. Everything we ate that night though, was quite fresh and deliciously seasoned.   We started out with the fried appetizer sampler, since we were pretty hungry and wanted something quick to munch on first. The fried seafood was seasoned well, pretty standard fried yumminess nothing too fancy. For our first entree bag we got the \"handful,\" which includes: 1lb crayfish, 1lb shrimp, 1dz andouille sausages, 1/2lbs clams, 2 potatoes, and 2 corns (we added extra corn and potatoes as well). We chose the popular \"homemade juicy\" seasoning (all the seasonings mixed together) with a low spicy level, since some of our friends cannot take too much heat. Once the bibs were on, and the gloves were covering our fingers, we clawed right away at our food! Soon we were under a sea of shells and napkins, and our once bountiful bag of deliciousness was starting to look scarce. We decided to order our second bag right away. This time, we got fancier and ordered a bag with snow crab legs! We also ordered more shrimp, sausages, and potatoes. We chose a different seasoning for this bag, just to see what the other sauces tasted like. We mixed the garlic butter with lemon pepper. The snow crab meat was delicious, but I might be bias because I just love crab! The seasoning was not bad, but I have to say I much prefer the homemade juicy seasoning (that is definitely the best seasoning to go with).   Although it was a Thursday, the restaurant was fairly busy. The place is quite clean, especially for such a messy eating arrangement. I'm glad Cle has finally caught on the Cajun seafood bag trend! We all left quite full and happy as clams! No doubt we will be back for more soon!"}
{"text":"I saw boiling Seafood on the map and my heart skipped a beat. There almost nothing i miss more about Texas than boiled crawfish"}
{"text":"Let's state the obvious: the name of this restaurant doesn't do it justice. I don't even like crawfish, so one might be dissuaded from the name, but don't be.  Ambience? 90s TLC (so I creeeeeeppp, yeahhhh) was playing, there were sand dollars and shells scattered throughout, and Stranger Things style lights were adorned flatly on the walls. Around us, happy patrons were elbows deep in giant buckets with bibs and gloves on.  We split a bowl of the lobster bisque, and ugh, it was unbelievably good. Like, probably my new favorite in Cleveland. It was big enough for 2 people, had hearty pieces of lobster meat in it and had a rich, memorable flavor. We even got a second bowl to go for a late night snack. For dinner, we didn't go too big (I hear the \"Experience\" is the thing to get), and instead went with the Fried Shrimp Basket and Fried Crab Basket. We were so unbelievably satisfied with our meal. And yes, it's possible to have a meal here without going full bib style (though that does look like fun).  Conclusion? An oddball, genius little place with a slightly mismatched name but yummy, inexpensive seafood that will make you a very happy camper."}
{"text":"This little place on Lee has some super tasty and fresh seafood.  We started with the clams in their house sauce made extra spicy and they were spicy and delicious.  The husband ordered a shrimp etoufee which he thought was great but I though was a bit too watery.  I had an oyster po'boy which was impressive.  The oysters were lightly battered, fresh and delicious on good bread.  The fries were crispy and delicious.  I couldn't stop dipping the fries in the sauce from the clams.  Really, this is a 4.5 star review.  If the etoufee were a bit better and they served alcohol, it would be a 5.  They did say that they would be getting their liquor license soon.  I'll definitely check back."}
{"text":"There's seafood boils in the south and then there is this place, which I guess would be like expecting a gourmet burger from McDonald's. If you are looking for a traditional southern seafood boil you'll be disappointed. Crawfish were rubbery (either over boiled or frozen and over boiled) and the seasoning was mostly \"on top\" without the opportunity to actually flavor the meat. Service was poor, they never followed up to see how things were - also forgot a portion of our order. Lastly, who serves finger food and is too cheap to have wet wipes for your fingers?!? Sick to Bourbon Street Barrel Room for traditional southern seafood and avoid this place."}
{"text":"We ventured to this area for dinner at another place but found it had closed so we opted to try this place.  We were greeted and promptly seated. The service was mediocre. Lots of excuses and mistakes in our order.  One ordered a lemonade to drink and something about the machine had to be fixed.  Supposedly a new cook who was doing things one at a time so our orders came out very haphazardly. Two appetizers, one of the entrees, then another appetizer, finally the lemonade, etc.  You get the picture. Oh and the sausages ordered with the pound of shrimp didn't come. I don't think we ever got them, the excuse was the cook forgot to turn on the oven.  The corn fritters and my po boy sanwhich were good. But the value for two to eat and have it cost $50 was definitely not worth it and we won't be going there again."}
{"text":"This place is exactly what I'd want in a seafood place. The idea is kind of along the lines of a low country boil, with all sorts of seafood spread out across a table covered in paper. Crab, mussels, clams, shrimp, and crawdads. Not to mention corn on the cob and potato! The corn fritters are a must-have too! The waiters are attentive, they will bring you beers if you're empty, along with extra gloves, utensils, etc. Lee was especially helpful, bringing us a sample of their \"Very Spicy\" sauce (which is made with ghost peppers). Let me tell you, if you complain about other places having foods that aren't spicy enough, you need to try (carefully) this sauce. I dabbed the smallest amount on my food and it was more than enough. Definitely a must-try for those that like spicy food."}
{"text":"Really like how authentic the restaurant seems to be, it's better pricing compared to other seafood spots in Cleveland. For variety of things to get and choose from compared to others also."}
{"text":"Superb! The food came out piping hot, as if straight form the boiler. We got the Handful. For sauces, you get choices between some butter stuff, some lemon, salt, and pepper stuff, some Cajun seasoning stuff, or all in one. Naturally, we went with the all in one.  Tip: if your bag doesn't come with a potato (as it did with the Handful), order at least a couple. The potato comes out perfectly soft (almost to the point of being mashed, if you squeeze hard enough); the inside starchiness balances out the strength of the sauce perfectly.  Tip 2: Get a cob of corn thrown in as well, for similar reasons.  I was pissing salt and chugging water for the entire night after, but this place does hit the spot when the craving sets in.  Note: if you into Crayfish, go for it. If you wanna try, order a small bit. Crayfish are notoriously stingy with their meat, and most of the weight is in the shells."}
{"text":"Food is delicious! And the service is just as great. My husband and I go so much that the waiter we usually have already knows what to bring us"}
{"text":"My first time here and first time doing a boil outside of a joes crab shack.  The food is great. My wife and i shared a boil of craw fish, shrimp and clams with corn and potatoes. The price for the amount of food was solid. We also had the corn fritters which had great crunch and texture. My only complaint is price difference between the house made boils and the create your own. Other then that food was amazing and service was great again."}
{"text":"Four young professional adults + big appetites + The Ultimate & the Appetizer Sampler (fried shrimp, oysters, calamari, crawfish) = Big Ass Grins & Full stomachs. The Ultimate feeds about 3 people so that's why we got the sampler. Granted this was for lunchtime so we were satisfied but if you're hungry and it's dinnertime, consider getting more for a group of 4.   We didn't know which seasoning to do so we just did the homemade juicy which is all of them and it was pure heaven. Also, we all liked things spicy but with it being a hot day and the fact that we're about to smash a lot of food, I recommend doing the mild like we did so you can actually remember how it all tasted. Don't worry, you get a big and gloves but it's likely with the homemade juicy that you'll still get sticky fingers so I just deal with it :) Also, maybe think about wearing darker clothing and nothing too nice.   For what you get, the price point is also reasonable with everything round out to about 25-30/person with tip and a beer each. Such a solid place - thank you for bringing this to Cleveland!"}
{"text":"The seafood was delicious! Po boys were pretty good but the crawfish was my favorite."}
{"text":"The flavor is very nice. I really like the medium size dish. Also the appetizers are great too!"}
{"text":"Normally I do not post reviews, but the boiling seafood is by far the best place I have ever gone to. Eating should not be boring, it should be a place to enjoy your time and the boiling seafood did just that. Before they put the dish on our table, they gave us bibs and gloves. The boiling seafood is a great place to bring your friends and family.   Now I have not even talked about the amazing food they severed there. The seafood is not like anything I have eaten before. It's not ordinary seafood they serve, they cook the seafood with its shell, and put it in a bag then you get to choose your sauce and spice, and they pour it in the bag and shake it up. The shrimp I had was fresh and juicy, and the lobster was amazing. Crawfish and blue crab were also good. Overall my experience was amazing and I WILL go there with my friends and family again."}
{"text":"Wow.. I was surprised by the taste and food quality at this restaurant. So glad to find this place!"}
{"text":"Let's just say if your planning to come on a Friday or Saturday make a reservation in advance.. although that is what we did and still waited. There was also another reservation for a bigger party that wasn't there so they seated us there and told us they would move us soon.. further on.... we order and had received our appetizers ( still didn't move us so I'm assuming they weren't moving us anymore) we get our DELICIOUS SEAFOOD and then we were asked to move in the middle of our dinner with gloves all dirty and a mess already created..(annoying right? I know)..   Point is seating and reservation is unorganized( even though I understand they only have limited space..  we had finished our dinner and the reservation had still not arrived.  There's more but I'll stop here and say that our waiter(Lucas) was really nice and made sure we had a good dinner.    We always get fried green potatoes, dozen of raw oysters, and the ultimate  ..   I rate the FOOD A 4.7 but reservation and service wise a 3"}
{"text":"This place is really good!!! Our server was amazing.... she knew the menu and gave us great advice on what to order. If you like seafood this the place! Don't bother going to red lobster or pickle bills!"}
{"text":"It's kind of a small place but the food is great. The flavors are good. They have lice crawfish that are pretty huge. I recommend for that seafood boil fix."}
{"text":"It was a great experience. We ordered homemade juicy and mild. We glad to order mild as it gets a kick. Corn fritters are good. Sweet corn with a crunch in the corn with horseradish dip. Fried oyster and shrimp. Definitely will go back again."}
{"text":"Don't be put off by how small and simple the dining area is......this place is GREAT!!  I would say that at least three people could share the ultimate with no problem.  They supply you with gloves, a bib, a bucket and lots of napkins and you need them all.  This will get messy so I suggest casual dress.  You choose the level heat and the seasoning for your bag.  If you like seafood this place is a must try.  Tip: Don't feel bad if you can't finish it."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I were on the hunt for good seafood. We arrived a little early so we explored around, What a neat little area of Cleveland. Little shops, pubs, restaurants, and wine bars. Very trendy neighborhood. Anyway, we were greeted by a very friendly young lady. The restaurant is a little small but they're very accommodating. Prices are pretty good. I had a very meaty delicious lobster tail and 2 clusters of crab legs for 45 bucks with corn and potato. Seafood doesn't get much fresher than this in Ohio. I could not get enough of the Cajun seasoning they used in the boil. It was to die for and they didn't skimp. I asked for mild and it was a little too spicy for me so listen to them when they say their spicy is SPICY. You can choose levels of spice from no spice to extra spicy. We also got the corn fritters and they were freaking awesome! My fiancé had catfish and fried shrimp, both were extremely flavorful. They add a pepper/onion sautée type deal to the top of their fried seafood that really sets it apart from other fried seafood and gives it an awesome flavor. We will be back here FOR SURE.   Sidenote: Do not wear white and do not come here on a first date. They give you a plastic bib and plastic gloves. USE THEM. I was COVERED in juice. I had it on my face, in my hair, and in my fiancée's eye ;)"}
{"text":"My husband and I are in town for some medical tests at Cleveland clinic. We like to \"Eat local\" so we decided to try this based on some of the recent reviews. It is DEFINITELY a hole in the wall kind of place. I was so hopeful. Unfortunately, very disappointed.  We ordered the corn fritters and sampler for appetizers planning to share, then other a dinner plate. The sampler included wings, shrimp, oysters and calamari. First, I love calamari. This wasn't the tender, rings or strips that we're used to. These were 5 inch, 3/4 in thick tentacles. NOT what we expected. But we tried it. Tough, chewy and not good. There were 4 pieces, we ate one.  The shrimp and chicken wings were good but the batter was so heavy you could barely taste them. Oysters were fried as well and hard to find in all the breading. Luckily, the corn fritters were good, although too sweet and a bit mushy for my husband. They could have cooked a bit longer, but acceptable.  I guess we should have ordered the boil or \"by the pound\", but we didn't think we would be able to eat that much. These were SERIOUS bags of food.  My husband mentioned that the restaurant had a weird smell. That should have been our first clue.  Service was good, our young lady was sweet and helpful. This did not make up for the food.   I was really hoping for some good seafood, this was not the place if you're craving seafood, rather than a Cajun boil.   Maybe you'll order better than we did."}
{"text":"I live in Houston so I know good crawfish and crab. I was not impressed with this place. First of all the food came out steaming hot to the touch which means it continued to cook, which in turn means it was over cooked. There is an art to cooking seafood. You need to know when to pull it out of the water so that it doesn't over cook. The flavor was on point but in my opinion it was overpriced and over cooked leaving me underwhelmed."}
{"text":"I heard about this place for a while and decided to finally check it out for my wifes bday. Its a small restaurant in a trendy part of town, not far from the cedar lee theater. Service was great, waitress was friendly, and the seafood was fresh. They had a bunch of cajun staples like po boys, etoufee, fried seafood baskets and sides like fried, corn and potatoes. The main dishes however were the bags of seasoned seafood. Its was great, the main special included shrimp, crawfish andouille sausage and others. I dont eat pork so I just got a pound of shrimp and pound if crawfish, which we split between 3 ppl but were still a little hungry, you probably need a pound a person to be full. Over all a great experience, we will be back"}
{"text":"Great place for seafood, we got the \"Ultimate Experience\" plus a pound of crab for 3. The ultimate experience came with a bag of crawfish, shrimp, snow crab, oysters, sausage, corn and potatoes and a side of fried calamari. The medium spice is decently spicy. More so than I expected it to be, but a good level of spice. Kind of messy since it comes in a bag and they're cooked in sauce and they give you a bib and plastic gloves to eat. Place is kind of small, so probably safer to make a reservation, to avoid a wait. We got lucky and they had just enough tables open to seat us when we got there (went on a Sunday night, around 6:30)"}
{"text":"Are those other reviews for real? :)  It's a former Chinese food take out place so it's tiny. The prices are very high, the waiter did not explain HOW the pricing works, it's per pound, not per item. You order a crab thinking you're paying $18 (for example) but you get a 2.5 lb crab (their choice of size) and get charged $45. Not cool. The lemon sauce tasted the same as the garlic, unless they used the same thing as my friends choice, we asked and they insisted they were different (they weren't). The sauces were gross. Do yourself a favor and go anywhere else on Cedar-Lee. Need Seafood? Go to Giant Eagle and make your own.  $100 tab for 2 small dinners, 2 beers and then had to wait forever (in this small place) for our bill. Never again. No thanks.  (the rap music didn't help any, either)"}
{"text":"The seafood here is really fresh! I really like the shrimp here! It is awesome! And the sauce here is special and tasty, you can choose different spicy level. We tried homemade mediam spicy this time and it is really good."}
{"text":"This is my second time coming here and it is a fun place to go to with group of friends or family. I came here on a sunday night for dinner with my family and friends. We got seated immediately since it wasn't a busy night. This place is very small and the seats can be limited. The menu has different varieties of seafood you can choose from depending on their market prices. If you are not eating  seafood by the pound they have other options such as sandwiches and soups. I ordered the snow crab legs , shrimp by the pound and a po-boy sandwich. The seafood by the pound has an option for the flavor and the spice level. I chose the Homemade Juicy flavor and extra spicy for the snow crab legs and garlic butter with extra spicy for the shrimp.If you order fries it is separate! And you only get potatoes and corn if you order over 2lb! Everything else is extra. Before the food comes you are given a bib, plastic gloves with buckets and crab cracker tool. The food comes out in a plastic bag in the amount of pound you ordered. The shrimp was very delicious, flavorful and the perfect amount of spice. The snow crab legs however was okay. You spent majority of your time cracking the crab legs instead of eating it. The po-boy sandwich wasn't anything special but the cajun fries were delicious! The atmosphere is very small but nice. I wouldn't come here if you were very hungry because it does take a while for the food to prepare. It is a little bit on the pricy side and you definitely don't go home feeling all the way full. Overall the flavors are good and the experience is good."}
{"text":"I usually really like this place because they have really good shrimp. I get the homemade juicy and medium flavor. Today my boyfriend and I went for dinner we decided to try the fried catfish appetizer, it was horrible ! The fish was over fried and very greasy we asked if it was fresh and were told it was fresh frozen. (Not sure exactly what that is) We wanted it taken off our bill since we ate 1 piece of it, we were first told No, then I asked to speak with the manager. The manager was extremely rude, he snatched the bill off the table adjusted it and then sent it back with the server. That kind of behavior from a manager is unacceptable, they have now lost the business of 2 patrons because of that display of Un-professionalism."}
{"text":"This place is great if you're coming for boiled seafood, which seems obvious given the name, but I think I should mention this given pretty much everything else on the menu isn't that great. I tried out the po-boy which was pretty lackluster, the server basically convinced me NOT to get the entouffe, and the fried mac and cheese bites were pretty awful as well. However, the boiled seafood at this place is good enough for me to still give it 4 stars. Their spiciness scale is actually legit, we ordered the 3 out of 4 level spiciness and it was crazy spicy, which rarely happens even when they claim it to be the spiciest level. The seafood was cooked really well and came out steaming hot (believe it or not, that hasn't always been my experience at these type of restaurants). The contents of the bag were drenched in hot, spicy, buttery sauce and we proceeded to chow down, gloves and bibs prepared. The service here was better than I expected, I loved how diverse the customer base is, and the servers were very friendly. The inside of the restaurant is a bit corny, they even go so far as to put those plastic crabs on the wall, but something about it still felt cozy and relaxed. Best of all, I do think the amount of seafood you get for the price is fair. It's not a screaming deal or anything, but if you had a group of people, you could definitely chow down on seafood without breaking the bank."}
