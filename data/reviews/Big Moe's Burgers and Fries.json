{"text":"Still one of the more juicy burgers (cheeseburger) around. However, the quality has gone down since last year for sure."}
{"text":"I only come here for the daily specials, specifically on Mondays. No complaints but you get what you pay for so the patty is thin as an iPhone lol It really wouldn't cost that much to add in a bit of protein and I'm willing to pay an extra 50 cents or so but I guess it's always money over anything."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken burger as it was a weekend special. The chicken burger was burnt and tasted terrible. Their burgers look good but not going to risk trying the food at that place again. Sorry"}
{"text":"I tried the Sunday special which was a chicken burger with fries for $5. The burger wasn't by any means bad. It just didn't have a \"wow\" factor; it was more like a \"k\". The fries were good but there was a strange taste about it, weird but not bad. On the plus side, they salt their fries (WOOT WOOT) which I think is fantastic because I rarely find places that'll still do that for you.   The service wasn't all that great. I was the only customer there at the time; it wasn't really a high-volume hour though, 4-ish in the afternoon. They gave me one packet of ketchup for a medium sized serving of fries. They kept on forgetting parts of my order so they'd keep asking me things. My order took at least 15 minutes to be ready-- a long time for a fast-food type joint; also, a long time for being the only customer there."}
{"text":"One of the best burger I have ever had!! Seriously Amazing, very juicy, falvoured, and fresh. Also, there deals are great. In some days u get th burger for 2.99$! U will definetly love it!! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Tuesday Special cheeseburger 2.79 great deal. First bite reminded me of KFC classic sandwich. Now to wash down the burger with a healthy alternative, guess I'll head over to Infuse Cafe down the street and get a matcha green tea."}
{"text":"Came here a while ago with a Groupon for their famous Juicy Lucy burger. I thought their burgers were really juicy and flavourful. I would definitely take advantage of their daily specials, but it does get pretty busy on Cheeseburger Tuesday so be prepared to wait a bit. The location is part of a small food court that also includes Villa Madina and Thai Express."}
{"text":"Big Moe's has become a parody of its former self in the last couple of months. I used to go for Tuesday cheeseburger specials every week for about a year without fail, but it has since lost its way.  Here are the facts when this franchise location is operating well: The ingredients are of high quality, with their buns being a favorite of mine. The regular menu is a bit pricey for a slightly above average meal but the daily specials offer good value. On a good day, wait time and service are on par with other premium burger joints.   Recently, the service has been nothing short of horrendous. It has been bad enough for me to all but abandon this establishment. My last three visits were as follows: 1) They told me their shipment of meat hadn't arrived yet so they couldn't make cheeseburgers. This was right after noon.... 2) They completely forgot my order on the stovetop. Had I not checked after 20 minutes my burger would have been a charred piece of rock. They didn't put on a new burger and were content giving me overcooked patties and hard, dry buns. 3) They seemingly gave away my order to someone else in their disorganized chaos. Had I not asked after waiting for 30 minutes I wouldn't have received anything at all. A sincere apology would have been nice at least...  To contrast that with what the service USED to be like, I once received a free order of fries because I had to wait 15 minutes instead of the regular 10, which was completely unnecessary for them to do. I've seen great favors done for the homeless and received perks for my loyalty but that has completely disappeared with the old staff gone.  I used to promote this place as a hidden gem but they have completely destroyed my love for them in a few short weeks."}
{"text":"I had my first Big Moe's experience last night and have to say i was very satisfied, I had a double patty burger with basic toppings and a side of fries, i figured the best way to try these burgers would be to go the traditional burger route. lettuce onions pickles mustard and ketchup. Well as i had hoped, the burgers were very good, Moe's use AAA fresh ground beef, fried on a griddle until they have a beautiful crispy crust on the outer edges.   These burgers are not your fat style burger, these burgers are flattened/smashed,The meat was juicy and delicious, the bun was also super fresh and doughy, i absolutely loved the burgers.   Their fries were also delicious, fresh cut and fried to the right crispiness. Not the best fries ever, but good, they could be double fried and use yukon golds and they would probably be closer to awesome status. Overall i had a very good experience, and a VERY good burger. and if you are not a calorie counter, these guys also make funnel cakes!! Topped with ice cream or chocolate sauce.. dirty dirty dirty.... I'll be back"}
{"text":"Big moes burgers and poutines and funnel cakes are tasty. Recommend the poutines and juicy luicy where each bite you take will have cheese squirting out of the beef. Sweet.  Prices are starting to creep up especially when they dont offer combos, so when you add fries and a drink to your burger, its over $10 for the \"combo\".  Portions are good. Service is a bit slow even when theres more than two employees. I prefer their old location near Pacific Mall but it has closed down."}
{"text":"I used to come here on Tuesday for the cheese burger deal because it was about the same price as a McD junior chicken. It was an alright burger but it would always take a while to prepare. The patty is pretty thin and dry. Now the price has shot up to 3.18 so now it's definitely not worth it. I also got the chicken and fries combo special for 5.65. The patty was really thin and dry as expected. If I didn't know it was chicken then I wouldn't have been able to tell. It was only topped with lettuce and mayo. Even though I know they toasted the bun it didn't taste like it and there was more bun that the stuff in the middle. The fries had a nice potato flavour and had little salt, which is what I prefer. The guy was very generous with the amount of fries but he was studying the box and squishing the bottom fries. So for half the box I had shredded mashed limp fries.  The quality of this place has never been up to the other burger places around it but the price used to match its quality. Now it's just not worth it."}
{"text":"Found this place as I was exploring downtown on a ladies' night. It's hidden within an array of 2 other restaurants within the same facility. I originally was craving a tornado potato, which they have at the Steeles location, but not this one here. So as a late night snack, we settled for a funnel cake which was ~$6. It was topped traditionally with regular vanilla ice-cream and strawberry sauce. There are other unique ice-cream flavours (ie. milo) and toppings (caramel, oreos) as well but it would've been an upgrade. The portion was decent as the 3 of us were satisfied after sharing 1 funnel cake. It was average; the ice-cream tasted like what came from a no-name branded 4L tub, and I wish there were bigger strawberry pieces in the sauce. If you have a funnel-cake craving but aren't looking for any wow-factor, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"I tried the hamburger and thought it was okay. The service was quick as i ordered it over ritual. Nothing really stood out about this burger so I give it a 3/5"}
{"text":"Took one bite of the burger and found the taste of the meat to be so overpowering and horrid (was it bad or was that some strange chemical I tasted?) I spat out the mouthful and I threw the rest of the burger in the garbage, didn't even want to risk giving it to my dogs.  Poutine was not bad but not good enough to make up for the horrid burger.  McDonalds or Wendy's would have been a thousand times better and less than half the price.  You only get one chance to make a first impression and Big Moe, you won't get a second chance from me.  Never again."}
{"text":"hands-down best fastfood burger I've ever had. I liked how the meat was fresh, fries were real. and the big dude here was courteous, respectful and friendly. I would make this my goto place for a burger and fries."}
