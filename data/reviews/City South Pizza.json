{"text":"Been eating here for many years, and no issue. 2 nights ago we ordered just 1 small pizza with ginger, garlic, extra pizza sauce, pepperoni, mushroom, green pepper and hot Italian sausage. They said 10mins for pickup. I waited 26mins in the store. No prob...they're busy. I got home and found no ginger, no garlic, no chilies, an extra dipping sauce, and 2 slices of pepperoni. I was shocked so I called. The same guy that took the order (the quiet one with the cap that works alongside the owner \"muggar\") seemed to be having many language understanding barriers and I patiently repeated what I was saying at least 4 times. He put me on hold 3 times. Came back and said they'll deliver a replacement in my lobby, which was right behind their establishment. They just wanted the pizza back to \"see if its missing anything\".....that was offensive, but sure, no problem I said. 10mins later he called back to say that they refuse to deliver a new one and I have to bring it to the store. I previously told him I was now alone with a baby (no car) and they JUST told me they would drop off to the lobby right behind them. He says \"oh well what I can do. That's it.  If you want new pizza then you come yourself\". I asked to speak to Muggar. He said no he's too busy. I said I'll wait. He said no you can't he said he's too busy. Then he had the audacity to say that I ordered it wrong, when HE took the order over the phone and had me repeat the order 4 times because he wasn't understanding and I speak English quite well. I asked why I have to pay for their mistake, and be told they will deliver then changed his mind. He said \"it was the owners decision so what I can do\".  Way to treat your paying customers guys. You win your community awards by word of mouth advertising, not mistreating people. After so many years, this is unbelievable. Sorry, but this experience quite literally left a bad taste in my mouth. I realize you may have issues with the language, but never blame your customers for your own mistakes, then try to pass me off like I am worthless."}
{"text":"Yelp helped me pick this one and it was wonderful. I even tried the Desi style pizza. Never heard of it before but I adore Indian food so it was a must try. I ordered for delivery and the person on the phone was great in answering all my questions and explaining what the Indian style pizza was. Even taught me the proper pronunciation.  Very reasonably priced and they certainly give you your money's worth of toppings.  Best pizza I have had in a long time.  Was delivered tasting fresh and hot. And the spice and crust was perfect.  Tip your driver well as he certainly ensures your pizza arrives quickly.  Yum Yum think I will have another slice"}
{"text":"Absolute garbage. I'm tired of these guys lying about being the best pizza in Brampton for 4 years. I literally just gave them another chance today for their 9.99 walk in extra large pizza. The thing was like cardboard and was very bland. No sauce and hardly had any pepperoni on it. I'm done. Garbage pizza. No more, I'm done."}
{"text":"Now and days there are soo many pizza places every corner and majority of them  seem to taste relatively the same. City South Pizza is popular in Brampton since they have the option of making it \"desi style\", which means adding finely chopped ginger and coriander on the pizza of your choice. Personally, its not my style because I might aswell eat Indian food at home, I don't want it on my pizza too! I ordered a medium 4 topping half meat lovers and half vegetarian for $10.79. My friend had the meat lovers (sausage, pepperoni & bacon) \"desi style\" and I had vegetarian ( pineapple, green peppers, onion & mushroom) and both sides were loaded with toppings. It also seemed to have a deep dish taste to it, which was delish and the pizza was not greasy at all. After eating 4 slices I didn't feel gross and had enough energy make my way to the golfing range. Love this pizza and their style, its not your traditional pizza place :)"}
{"text":"This is some of the best pizza I've ever had. I would rank this right after some of the deep dish pizza I've had in Chicago. Ingredients were fresh and plentiful. Pizza had a unique and great taste. Staff at the counter was very friendly. Menu was decent and prices were reasonable. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Great Pizza... Toppings are fresh and cheese is yummy... The place is buzzing with activity and still every order is made within 15-20 mins. Better than those chain-shops... Recommended for all"}
{"text":"(Big sigh) first of all I'm aware that Brampton has Shoty pizza in general, but for some reason I thought that if I pay enough extra toppings maybe I could get a decent one. Boy was I wrong I payed for triple pepperoni and double cheese hoping for a nice cheesy melty pizza full of crispy pepperoni. What do I get? Three pepperoni per slice on a large... a thick hard layer of cheese and for the cherry on top a hair on one of the slices.   Garbage food only reason they get business is cuz new to the country Sheridan students don't know good pizza."}
{"text":"Holy hell this is the mother of all pizza joints and even better they make desi pizza! It was spicy, fiery, crisp, cheesy, tangy, and meaty all in one. Ridiculously fresh and a 3 topping Large for $14.99! Definitely a convert."}
{"text":"Greatest pizza! I only get my pizza from here and at least once a week. So delic that I'm writing a review...when ordering go \"Indian style\"."}
{"text":"Go to pizza place for Sheridan College students since it's right across from the building. Cost $5.50 for a medium 1 topping pizza or $6.25 with tax. They also have poutine and wings too.   Pizza is ok, just to fulfill any cravings and if you want to split it between friends...it's not too pricy.   Service is fast and staff are flexible. Ie. I didn't want to carry a pizza box on bus with me so they put it in those take away bags."}
{"text":"I like their thin crust pizza and I like how they're reasonably priced. I wouldn't say they're amazing and a must try, but it's a fail safe place to order pizza if you're trying to watch your spending.   I don't really have much to say about them, they're alright. I'll continue to order from them again, if Pizza Hut doesn't have a deal :p"}
{"text":"We \"used\" to order the family special every week or two on a regular basis. Food was decent & value for the $ (at that time) was fairly good too. One night we ordered, the food was delivered. We paid cash & tipped well (always do, as I used to deliver fast food myself). We get a telephone call the next day saying that we shorted the driver $10. WTF? Seriously? Like the driver would NOT know this right at the door (if it were true)? We do NOT get a call that night (we ordered for dinnertime) but the next day! Clearly they got ripped off by their driver. We have NOT ever ordered from there again. Brampton's best pizza(s)..Mackay & Gusto's."}
{"text":"City South pizza is located at hurontario and raylawson corner plaza right behind the Magnota winery facing south."}
{"text":"I read that this place was ranked \"one of the best pizza's in Brampton\"....I'm gonna say nope!!  I ordered just a small za with Pepperoni/Mushroom/Sausage on it. It was small all right. The pizza maker put, get this..one piece of pepperoni on each slice!! That it...one! The crust had a funky taste to it too...kinda weird South Asia flavour. It filled the spot but it left me wanting a better pizza!! Won't go outta my way to eat here again! Disappointed."}
{"text":"Great pizza but lacks consistency. Lots of toppings to choose  from. Needs more choices  in dipping sauces."}
