{"text":"Was quite disappointed here, as we're the other 5 people I was with. I had the ribs which were very tough and slathered with a bit too much sauce. My gf had the sliders and said that they all tasted the same and they were nothing special. 

The service was a bit lacking as well. Our server didn't come over at all after delivering our food to check if its ok or to even as us if we wanted anything else. 

Overall, we all walked out disappointed to the length that we probably wouldn't go back to give it another try which is a shame because I live in the good and would like to support local business."}
{"text":"Only based on the ribs.  They are OK(especially based on the price point). Tough ribs. Not tender. Good fries. Hush puppies a lil dry and kinda not unique. 

 Maybe because I've been lucky to have had really great southern bbq from NY to the Carolinas. Like many yyz bbqs they are OK and this is in that bracket.  

In terms of restaurant execution it's 3/5 as well.  Nice ideas,  half ass execution. 

I hear the sliders are good. Next time(maybe).

Get a cash machine or take debit/credit capability.  
I would have spent double upfront was ready to order more... but only had so much cash in wallet."}
{"text":"We were in the mood for bbq and since Phil's and Hadley's are closed down, we decided to try two bite saloon on Bloor West - a group of four on a Saturday evening. 

A friend and I decided to split an order of sliders - 7 sliders for $21
I tried the Korean fried chicken, fried chicken, catfish and 1/2 of the pulled pork slider. My friend got the beef (burger) slider too and the inside was slightly pink. He sounded a little upset at first but continued to finish it :) all amidst a conversation of how burgers should not be pink.

Our favorites were the catfish and the korean fried chicken. 

The two others tried the fish ball appetizers. I had a bite, was not a big fan of the sweet and savory. They tried the ribs which came with fries. They thought the ribs were alright. 

Overall, a good place. I'd def go for the sliders again. Cheap and delicious. Good beer too."}
{"text":"We came in late on a Wednesday night and were barely acknowledged by the waiter. The place was almost empty but we decided to give it a shot anyways. We ordered sliders and the poutine. Sliders were fine but not extraordinary. The gravy in the poutine was way too salty and we were disappointed. How do you mess up on a poutine? The service was sub par as the waiter didn't check up on us during our meal. A combination of average food and poor service will not be bringing us back."}
{"text":"My BF and I decided to finally check this place out as we literally live across the street from it.  It was St Paddy's day around 8.30pm and the place was fairly quiet when we walked it - just three other tables. 

Our waiter (\"Dublin\") seemed drunk and was neither funny nor professional - just awkward and weird.  

We placed our order and it took another 10 minutes for our drinks to arrive - Dublin forgot what I had ordered.  

BF ordered the ribs and said they were nothing special.  His fries were the scatterings from the bottom of a frozen bag - overcooked and tasteless.  

I ordered 5 sliders for $15 and got pulled pork and brisket.  I also asked for fries but Dublin said my BFs meal came with fries.  Which is odd - he doesn't know how hungry I am and maybe we don't want to share fries?  Also, what about add-ons for the bar?  Very strange.  Ended up not ordering fries and just as well.  

The sliders tasted the same to me and I needed something else on my plate to cleanse my under-whelmed palate.  The meat was dry and the buns were store bought white crap.  I only ate 3 and BF helped with one, although he didn't enjoy it.  

We spent $55 for 2 drinks and two \"mains\" which seemed a lot for what we ended up with.  For a bar/restaurant narrowing its focus on such a small menu, you would think that the execution would be excellent - sadly it wasn't.  

When we walked out (mainly because a chap was setting up for karaoke - really, in that small place?) everyone had left and the place was empty.  I noticed a sign outside announcing sliders at $2.50 each, which meant I was overcharged for my food.  

Too bad, won't be going back which is a shame as we would like to support the neighbourhood.  Would not recommend to anyone.

Tallboys next door has a better beer selection and Hogtown Vegan two doors down has (surprisingly for us carnivores) better food."}
{"text":"I've read good and bad things about this place.  Having spent a lot of time eating southern food I figured I'd give it a shot. Vibe is chill and unpretentious.  My date and I felt relaxed and there was no pressure or hawking from the staff.  Beer menu had a lot of local brews and we split a few of their sharing bottles(great concept- loved the sawdust  stout) 

Then the food came.   We split ribs and 5 sliders. Damn!  Just little bite sized pieces of deliciousness.  I can see how this kind of menu could be redundant but they've done a great job of offering an array of flavors.   I love the house made peameal and how smokey a lot of the meat was.  I as im close to this hood i will be back soon."}
{"text":"Food was great - (it even improved the second time tried) - can't comment on the drink list but everyone went for second rounds.  Nice atmosphere - dark cozy and not ridiculously loud.  Have all praise for this place.  Nice to see them in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I dont know what the hype is about the food. It is bar food at best, and not even great bar food.  You can get better at Jack Astors for less. We ordered the catfish sliders- bland, and pulled pork sliders- better, but not great. We also got the ribs- dry and hardly any sauce, and there were only 4 ribs, and the wings- which were thick and meaty, but once again, quite disappointing in flavour. Also, $17 for 5 wings! That is quite a rip off.

The ambiance is cool, but not one to rave over. 

Overall, I would put this resto at a 3/5. Not some place I would go out of my way to eat at."}
{"text":"This place was great -- ordered a collection of 5 sliders for $16. The 5 sliders were big and filling enough to share between 2 people. Really enjoyed the Korean fried chicken and jerk tofu sliders. The regular fried chicken was good, but preferred the spices and tanginess in the Korean one.

My vegetarian friend had the pulled mushroom and jerk tofu sliders and was pleased with them.

Good collection of craft beers on tap. Try to grab a table in the front when it's warm out when the front windows are opened out onto Bloor St.

Also, if you order a collection of sliders, ask your server for a legend. They use a varied collection of toothpicks to help you decipher which slider is which."}
{"text":"Great service, awesome food, what more can you want? Try the sliders, especially the pulled pork!"}
{"text":"The Two Bite Saloon is a total winner!!!! Great atmosphere, delicious and reasonable  menu, pricing is very much on point! The ability to mix and match various sliders works well with groups. Fantastic music, mix of oldies and classics. We loved it."}
{"text":"The sliders were great , always adding new flavors and styles. Their wait staff was also super nice and friendly, I never felt rushed or under served. Most importantly though, everything was super fresh."}
{"text":"Sliders were great, service was a bit rough. Brunch menu recommended."}
{"text":"Try the sliders, they are awesome! Love places that keep the menu simple yet good. Couple this with a the low key atmosphere and good company and its hard to leave quickly....well, that and a great craft beer list!"}
{"text":"The setup is laid back for this place. 
Their claim to fame are the sliders and can be ordered in a mix and match configuration (3,5,7 and 10) I would say if you are larger group for sure go for the 10 count. 
I ordered a 3 count with 2 beef and one catfish. The beef was so so but the catfish was a pleasant surprise. I would come back just for the cat fish again if in the mood for sliders and perhaps even try other non beef iteration. 
Beer list though long needs a bit more diversity. Cocktails seem to be their forte' along with the sliders. 
A good spot to check out if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Decided to venture a little bit outside my usual 'hood, because, as I always say, \"At least if it sucks I can Yelp about it!\"

Two Bite has a good concept behind it, but some of the execution is lacking.  I will talk about the good points first.  I though the service was good - when we first arrived it was early, only about 5:30,and we were the only two in the restaurant, but the only server didn't make us feel like he was going to hover over us and make chit-chat - he let us be, while still paying attention to us enough.   I liked the ambiance of the place, and the bathrooms were really nice (this is always a big deal to me for some reason).

We ordered 5 sliders for $15.  $3 a slider seems really steep to me for what you get.  I think a $2 price point would make a lot more sense.  We had all the meat sliders (not the tofu) - peameal, brisket, beef, pulled pork and fish.  The fish was the best, by far.  I thought their system of identifying which slider was which (colour coded toothpicks) was ingenious.  We had a side of collard greens, which my dining companion said were \"too tangy\".

The real highlight for me, however, was the cocktails.  We ended up trying four on the list, and they were all excellent -- really excellent, maybe some of the best cocktails I've had in Toronto in a while.  For me, if I were going to recommend this place, I'd say go for some pre-dinner drinks and snacks, and then go somewhere else for your main meal."}
{"text":"I came here to hang out and have a beer while waiting to meet a friend nearby. It's dark and comfy, service is friendly and quick.

I had a beer and a cocktail (AMAZING) and also some fries and gravy. They were okay, the fries were a bit soft for my taste and the gravy tasted a bit sour. I chalked it up to maybe a bit of vinegar or booze to give it flavour, but I felt pretty gross after eating it.

I'd like to try their sliders, maybe I'll go back on a day when I'm ready to eat, rather than snack."}
{"text":"Don't want to give away our Sunday brunch secret but it's too good not to share. We bring our toddlers here as well and it's always delicious. We want to come back one night for the pig roast too!"}
{"text":"I don't generally like to review places that are in their first few weeks of operation, as clearly there are always kinks to be worked out. So please, bear that in mind. 

A newcomer to my peculiar Bloorcourt block is always exciting at first, but generally has proven to be disappointing. There's always something missing that you can't quite put your finger on. 

Out of these new additions, I must admit that Two Bite seems to be the leader of the pack.  This somewhat-rustic, BBQ-inspired joint has yummy, cute food and a chill atmosphere.  

We grabbed 7 sliders (catfish, tofu and pulled pork), fries and a beer on special (Spike red for $5 tax in).  Everything came to $26, which seemed like a deal to me. Catfish and tofu were surprisingly delicious with great texture. My pulled pork was barely lukewarm, which could be their intention, but I prefer mine on the warm to hot side of things. Fries were standard. We were still a bit hungry and could have ordered more food but decided to bounce out of exhaustion. 

Service was a little lacking. It was probably one of the owners, but it felt like he had never served before. We waited a long time to order (with only one or two other tables in the place), the food was not quality-checked, and our table was not cleared when presented with the bill. As I mentioned, this place is VERY new, and I feel that's something that will sort itself out with time. 

I will obviously return, and am looking forward to trying the ribs and the beef-based sliders. Seems like this place has great potential for future drinking and dining."}
{"text":"A good solid 4; maybe a four and a half! 

You know that feeling when you go to a new place and you just know you have found a regular hangout? This is how I feel about this bar.

I like the atmosphere...relaxed, casual and unassuming! Everything a bar should be! I like the staff; friendly and helpful. I love that you can add a dollar, yes 1 dollar and at the end of the week they take all the money collected, make sliders and take them to local hostels and shelters! 

The drinks...cocktails are so good; the gimlet is incredible and a perfect balance! It is summer in a glass. I am not a beer/ale drinker but my friends who enjoy craft beers like this place. Who can resist an ale named \"long dark voyage to Uranus\" or the other appropriately named \"lube job\". I imagine the jokes made when ordering these must grow tiresome...did not stop us cracking out a few...jokes that is! (Trying hard to keep my mind out of the gutter!)

Eats; collard greens is a must try...cooked with smoked ham hock...delicious!

Sliders; by now I have tried them all with the exception of tofu. For me pulled pork; brisket and pea meal stand out. Simple food but done well; 10 sliders for $25...pretty decent. I must try other food on the menu but those tasty little baps get me every time! 

Cool place to hangout with friends; eat and relax!"}
{"text":"Cash only for now, my fav new resto in Toronto. Fantastic

The sliders were wonderful, the poutine salty and cheesy and great, must return and try the ribs. Awesomesauce"}
{"text":"Very good quality of sliders and bar food. 

we ordered 10 sliders so I could get a taste for most of them listed on the menu. 

Pulled pork-3/5 my only suggestion is bbq sauce

Catfish- very tasty, lightly fried but didn't taste frozen. 5/5

Brisket- very good. I would get again 5/5

Pork belly- 4/5-crispy and well seasoned. I wish more came on the bun. 

Chicken - very good overall 3/5

Also had the wings (about 7-8 decent size in their servings) and fries for $14. The wings were awesome!!!! 5/5 

Next time I would get more pork belly and brisket sliders followed by wings. 

Beer prices were average. They had a $5 draft Ipa and it was awful. But just my preference to something else. 

$65 total for 10 sliders, 3 beers, wings and fries. (Not including tip)"}
{"text":"I liked the atmosphere, the service, cheap beer and that it's close to a subway stop. I can't really say the food blew me away though, albeit I didn't try the ribs yet. 

Poutine was like any other I've had before, sliders were decent (pork, beef and fish, tofu sold out). Kale was OK too. I liked the beer on special though, Red for $5."}
{"text":"A block or so east of Ossington on Bloor, is a cozy little bar and restaurant that I popped into for a drink and bite. The place is laid out with a bunch of 2-4 seat tables in the front, a bar in the middle, and then larger wooden tables for bigger groups closer to the back before the kitchen. Music selections playing were a cross section of 90's acts, literally across all genres for better or for worse including bands like Soundgarden, Jamiroquai, Third Eye Blind, Kris Kross, Snow, and beyond. Very little to absolutely no cohesion in their playlist outside of the era it all originated. Some good, some bad, all of it 90's based - but it was not played at an unbearable level so I only mention this for expectations and not really for rating needs.
 
Given the name of the place, the sliders seemed like the most logical place to start. They start at the ballpark price of $3.50 each (3 for $10.50) and reduce to $2.60 each when you order a plate of 10 (for $26). They did not disappoint, and I'll say the pork belly was my favourite, followed by the burger, and the pulled pork which was okay but not great. I also liked the little wooden trays they are served in. 
For desserts I had their beignets which were pretty tasty, although I wasn't a big fan of the dipping sauce that came with them.

6 craft beer and 1 cider on tap, and a total of 27 craft beers to choose from on their craft beer menu when taking bottles, tall boys, and pint options all into play. Although a number of them had actually sold out, there were some unique 650-750ml bottles ranging $10-$13 including one from Kelowna I'd never had before that I enjoyed.

Craft beer and good food is usually a safe bet for an enjoyable experience. This was true to form in this situation, so 4 stars it is!"}
{"text":"For NYE absolutely great service and the sliders and hush puppies were yummy. Loved the Manhattan and the old fashioned. Solid beer selection and great staff. A go to place."}
{"text":"This is what I look for in ribs. Amazing sauce! Sliders kick ass too. Ill be back soon. Great great place. Could use a few more menu items though. Some chicken or a different variety of ribs."}
{"text":"Sliders are a must! The rest of the food on the menu is amazing as well.  Great selection of microbrewery beers. The staff are amazing and it's a place I would go back to on a regular basis. Amazing music when they have a DJ.  The atmosphere of a saloon is brilliant and cozy.  5 stars all the way!"}
{"text":"This place had a lot of potential, but it did not live up to it.  

I was going on a double date and we had tickets to a show that started at 8pm.  We wanted to grab a bite to eat beforehand and were looking for places online.  This place looked really good and we tried to make a reservation beforehand since we thought it may be busy on a Saturday night.  We called and called and called over the span of a few hours and no one ever answered the phone - nor is there voicemail.

We tried it out anyway and were able to get a table.  The place is small, but there was a decent amount of seating both table wise and at the bar.  There was a big table at the back that was taken up by a large party.  

I was disappointed in the size of the menu.  I thought there would be more options other than just sliders.  But that was the gist of it.  My favorite was the peameal bacon slider - you get a pretty nice piece of bacon too.  None of this thinly sliced shit.  The catfish was my second favorite.  The burger was meh.  I didn't like the mustard on it.  BTW if you don't like mustard, this isn't the place for you b/c it seemed like mustard was on everything.  The pulled pork was forgettable and the brisket was surprisingly dry.  

We got the poutine with brisket as well.  Again, dry brisket, with cheese mainly on one side.  The peppercorn gravy was tasty though.  The corn bread was a nice size and didn't taste too bad though I didn't like the sticky glaze it had.  

As I mentioned, this place had lots of potential.  Fun concept - BBQ tapas - but the execution just failed."}
{"text":"Two bite saloon is a regular stop for me and my girlfriend. We go almost weekly for the wing Thursday deal. Great deal, great deep fried wings with great fries. Comes with delicious dipping sauces. There's always a beer on sale for $5. Huge rotating local selection.
   Non chicken wings food is great too. The sliders are delicious. Some varieties are similar, so just be careful when you craft your order. Highly recommended. Sunday evenings are all you can eat pig roasts. A good deal, but the normal menu is not available."}
{"text":"The coffee is well presented in a French Press, and the cornmeal pancakes are the best pancakes I've had in Toronto"}
{"text":"Gord and I stopped in for a drink on Saturday night and we sat at the bar.

When we walked in, we noticed right away how amazing it smelled.  When we asked what it was, we were told it was the ribs ... apparently they have a smoker in the back.  They also serve sliders ... you can mix and match 'em.

We'll definitely be back for a meal."}
{"text":"Great cozy place; great for lunch or dinner. 

They have great tasting sliders (which are pretty big for sliders) and I have tried most of them. I would pretty much recommend all of them but I wasn't a big fan of the brisket, but I loved the rest. The fried chicken is fantastic and so is the pulled pork. 
I haven't tried the ribs, but from what I've heard from my dinner accompaniment they were fantastic."}
{"text":"Server was attentive, but a little awkward, which is fine. The sliders are tasty, but a little small even for a slider. Had three and a pint and am still pretty hungry. To have spent $21 (with tip) and not be full is a bit of a bummer.

That said, it's worth going back just for the pork belly slider."}
{"text":"In my opinion, there is just nothing better than tiny versions of food items - so Two Bite Saloon was an easy choice for a dinner with friends! 

I'm not fully sure how I feel about the decor and ambiance of this place - I feel like they tried, but didn't quite get there. There are some random pictures of Native Americans on the wall (at least they seemed random to me, but perhaps there's a story there) that were kind of awkwardly placed and a bit to small for the wall they're on. There's also some random wallpaper, and while I really liked the chairs in the front dining area, the booths in the back do not match at all. Also they lose points for only have one saloon-style decor item - swinging doors into the kitchen. 

HOWEVER - I was very impressed by the delicious menu and unique beer list. More is always better for sliders, so we ordered the 10 (saving us about $2 over ordering 3 each individually) and sides of deliciously seasoned fries and the kale salad. The three burgers I tried were pulled pork (delicious, just the right amount of BBQ sauce), the catfish (was it even catfish? either way it was crispy, not too oily, and very delicious) and the classic beef (adorable little patty). The fries were salty and well seasoned, and the kale salad was also pretty good, though it didn't quite fit the meal for me. We also enjoyed some of the \"shared beers\" which are the perfect size for splitting between two people. 

One thing I need to note about the food, is that the slider buns are amazing. Maybe it's just because I don't eat a lot of white bread, but they were SO GOOD! Just the perfect size and kind of sweet, YUM! 

So, all-in-all, I will certainly be back for more. This is just the perfect spot for a pub night that isn't too traditionally pub-y. Well done Two Bite!"}
{"text":"Great selection of drinks.

Food--meh. Left something to be desired. A friend got ribs, which were leathery and crazy spicy. The sliders are alright---nothing to write home about, and the salad was pretty lame for what it was. Salad greens, under-ripe watermelon, and candied pecans (which were awesome)."}
{"text":"Totally agree with Susan G - If I could, I would eat tiny versions of food items all the time!  

Decided to check out Two Bite Saloon with friends for drinks and dinner.  They had Mill St. Organic pints on special for $5 - Sold!  

We ordered 10 sliders ($25) and mixed it up with tofu, beef, brisket and catfish varieties.  The best tasting ones were the catfish...lightly breaded with a very nice spicy mustard.   We also got sides - fries ($3.50) and coleslaw ($5).  Fries were decent as was the 'slaw.

Service was friendly - our waitress checked on us several times and offered to split our bill three ways with no qualms.

Atmosphere was laid back but they were pumping some strange lounge/dance music over the speakers which seemed a bit out of character.

Check out the flooring in the bathroom if you are mourning the current extinction of the Canadian penny."}
{"text":"Passed by this spot the other day and thought I would give it a try since I love BBQ/Southern eats.

The spot is cute and cozy with an open window front when the weather is nice.

The menu consists of a variety of slider options such as catfish, fried chicken, pulled pork, brisket etc. as well as ribs, mac and cheese, hush puppies, wings and more.

I ordered 3 sliders for $10 and went with the catfish, pulled pork and fried chicken.  All of them were equally delicious with the catfish probably being my fav.  My friend ordered the mac and cheese which was served in a skillet and topped with some sort of amazing BBQ sauce, it was really good!

The place also has an excellent selection of craft beer, cocktails and bourbon!"}
{"text":"Bar Crawl #3: Bellwood Wizard Wolf Session Ale & Tequiia Shot

Two Bite Saloon was selected as the third stop not because of the drink selection but of the food. The beer list though not too bad but unfortunately there was some issue with the draft lines so just bottles available.

I ended up trying: 

Hush Puppies  ($7) Savory Cornbread Balls Filled with Diced Taso Ham
Southern Fried Wings ($14) - Super crispy batter and moist inside, though not much flavour without dipping them into the hot and bbq sauce on the side
3 Sliders ($10) - I think I ended up eating  the beef one? not too memorable 

I ended up drinking:

Bellwood Wizard Wolf Session Ale 500 ml ($11) was A-OK for sharing and thanks Evelyn for the shots..

There was surprisingly limited selection of bourbon: there was only 1 that evening..

Two Bite Saloon is a decent place to grab a bite but really if you are into crafted beer."}
{"text":"Great ambience and nice wait staff, and the food is great. The mini burgers are random and delicious and the macaroni and cheese is amazing though pretty heavy. I could only finish half of it, but it was really, really good. A nice place to go for a drink or dinner with a nice relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"Howdy, Pahtneh!

Two bites? These sliders are pretty big, they're at least 4 bites. The 3 for $10 deal they are rockin' is too much for me... so bring a friend who is a bigger eater to be your sweep canoe. If you're going the slider route, and you should, double up on the fried chicken. It's a tiny crispy, greasy and mayo-y delight. Poutine was meh. 

The ambiance is dark and perfect for a drink with friend or shamefully eating slider after slider with a poutine chaser in the corner."}
{"text":"The sliders have sooooo much flavour packed into such a tiny package! Plus they are well priced!!  Our favourites were the pulled pork, kimchi fried chicken and.... well.... They were all good! The beer is reasonably priced and local. Staff is friendly. It is a chill and relaxed atmosphere. Amazing for groups or even for a quick bite by yourself. Owner was very generous and donated 2 $25 gift cards for our ride to conquer cancer fundraiser!!!"}
{"text":"Thank you Jen K for pub #3 at Two Bite Saloon! 

Here they have awesome sliders deals: 
3 for $10
5 for $15
7 for $19
10 for $25

Catfish slider (crunchy seasoned panko topped with Creole remoulade) was AMAZING! The Creole remoulade is A+++ which made the other sliders taste very bland...

I actually really liked the Southern Fried Wings ($14), I thought they were so tasty and NOT TINY! I used my fingers to eat these (an extremely rare occasion. I am a master fork user.)

I didn't like the Hush Puppies ($7, Savory cornbread balls filled with diced taso ham), they tasted like bread balls.... I guess I didn't feel like bread balls that night.

I had the Nutcracker Porter (by Black Oak) $11 which was pretty nice! They also have beers from Beer Academy, Wellington Brewery, and Nickel Brook Beer AND YES, ALL FROM ONTARIO!

Really like the vibe: dark, intimate lighting with wooden tables, like a cottage! With the snowstorm blowing outside the window, it was so nice to hang out here. HOWEVER it's a very small place!"}
