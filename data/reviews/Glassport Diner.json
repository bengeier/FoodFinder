{"text":"This place is Glassports little hidden gem. The  food is good and cheap. It's also a great place to eat off a hang over in the morning.

They serve breakfast all day, but I also  recommend their burgers."}
{"text":"Glassport Diner is awsome. Go on Fridays for the fish and haluski! Remember to take cash with you as they do not take cards."}
{"text":"I remember coming here whwn i was little and the food was always good. I recently tried it again and it has definitely went downhill. The food is fairly cheap but the restaurant is very dirty (and could use an update)."}
{"text":"The food was good but the service was terrible. We were the only table in there and the waitress seemed annoyed that we had even came. 
The service can make or break an establishment. I did not feel welcome, I felt like an inconvenience. I doubt that we will return. 
I got a steak salad which was good. My husband ordered a steak and cheese sandwhich, which was delicious! I also find it odd that you have to pay for lettuce and tomato on your sandwhich?"}
{"text":"Excellent, local cash only diner featuring very inexpensive meals cooked fresh to order. There is a bar to sit at and also a dining room in the rear. service was excellent and our meals arrived promptly. Drinks were always kept filled."}
