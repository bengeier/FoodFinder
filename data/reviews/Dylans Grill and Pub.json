{"text":"I been driving past here the last few weeks been here several times when it was Santora's finally stopped in to check it out the bartender was very nice she explained all the promotion's. I played the four card keno and hit my 5 spot I ordered flatbread BBQ chicken also a cheeseburger the food could use a little Improvement that being said. I will be back again"}
{"text":"This is our go to bar for movie night. Good selection of beer on draft and amazing food. Overall it's a chill spot to meet up with friends or just grab a bite and a beer."}
{"text":"I love coming here with my wife on date night. A night away from the kids where we can just get a little time to ourselves and have a couple drinks together. It's a great bar! Highly recommend! THE staff is wonderful as well"}
{"text":"Ordered the BLT and it was perfect! the bartender was super sweet and even though the bar was pretty full, very attentive to us. Coming back for sure just to try more good food and service!!!"}
{"text":"Trina makes some of the best bar food in the area.  Bartenders are friendly and fast.  Great neighborhood bar, I always feel at home here.  Great Happy Hour specials too."}
{"text":"First time here.  Food was awesome, service was great. We'll be back for sure. Lot's of parking. Clean restrooms."}
{"text":"Dylan's pub is a nice solid neighborhood bar.   It's not fancy but it's not divey.  It a good clean local bar with good craft beer selection and menu with lots of reasonably priced \"bar food\" to choose from.   The staff is friendly and the place is well lit with several TVs  and there is a separate restaurant areas hat is open during the day.   There is also a pick up to go window if you are in a hurry!!    If you get any of the appetizers you should try the \"pub ranch\".  It's ranch with a mild spicy kick( I'm a spice wuss and this is very enjoyable)"}
{"text":"First time was a visit yesterday for Sunday night football after work. It was amazing. Trina is in charge of the kitchen and is amazing as well! She goes out of her way to make sure the food is prepared correctly and tastes great! Kathy and Dawn are amazing bartenders and my favorite is Deni!!! She works Wednesday, Thursday and Friday swing shift. So that's 6pm to 2am! It's worth going in to see her!!! And Trina of course! I can't get enough of this place, their food, and I win a lot playing keno! They have a lot of great gaming deals as well! Go in there and get a drink, or food. I'll be there for sure!"}
{"text":"My experience was half negative and have positive. It's blatantly clear that to the left is a separate storefront specifically for food and to go orders. There are two signs that state that. I noticed those signs before, and it is partly why I chose this place thinking I could get some food and wait in this area and not be in the bar. I have no desire to be in a bar. I entered, I was not acknowledged, so I said hi..he did not reply, and just looked at me as though he had never seen a person before. After a few minutes of having me wait he stated if I wanted to go food then I needed to order it in the bar. Then why do the signs exist? If you look at the pictures I included, you may have to zoom in at the picture of the door, you can see it says place food orders here. I ordered some food from the bar and then used the bathroom. I must say that the bathroom was immaculately clean and they did a beautiful job remodeling this place. Bartender was engaging, fun, and attentive but slightly obnoxious, but could be acceptable. I wouldn't know. The pizza according to the menu was $10.95 and the chicken fingers were $7.95 which equates to $19.71 after tax. But my total was $22.59.  I was anxious to get out of there so didn't pay attention to the total initially.  I got home and looked at the receipt it was only a credit card receipt not an itemized receipt so it was unclear why it was that much. I did add on a side of ranch at the last minute but I cannot imagine that it was three dollars. When it came time for me to pay, the bartender stated that her Internet was down???? Really. That needs to be the first thing out of your mouth when somebody orders something. She tried it and my card went through, if not I would've been extremely irritated and I would've expressed it. If my card didn't go through and I had to go somewhere else to get food I probably would've went off on the bartender after 12 hours of working the last thing I want to do is go somewhere else and wait again because of her lack of consideration to mention it initially. Honestly the credit card factor and the price factor makes me suspicious. Just to clarify I don't care about three dollars I just wanted to know why and was unable to conclude why since I was not given an itemized receipt. Maybe there is a reasonable exclamation.Chicken fingers were gross and basically not edible, way over fried and oversauced. The pizza was good, but not sure if I'll be back."}
{"text":"We  stopped in at Dylan's on Saturday during the day shift, and Sherry was working, and she is a AWESOME bartender!!! The place was super clean and the menu is limited, but great for bar food! But the best part of being here was the bartend, she is fun and and gave us great service, and made us feel at home. Want to go off the beaten path, this place is worth it !! Stop in and ask for Sherry!!! She works Sat Sun days and swing Mon and Tues. Worth the drive!! I love Sherry!!"}
{"text":"If there was an option for zero stars I'd give this place 0. Horrible food. The manager got up to make my food since the first cook messed it up. I was still upset she couldn't even make my meal properly. I told the manager it was fine I'll pass yet she insisted and once I stood firm saying I don't want your food she threw a fit and told me it isn't a fine dining restaurant so be quite. I asked for her name she refused to give it to me. I had heard one the bartenders call her Trina. So I'm left to assume that's who caused the problems I had there. The eggs were supposed to be over easy. I don't know how hard that is to this place. It was completely dead with no business. I should have learned from that alone. Place is garbage. Overpriced drinks. Wouldn't go back if it was the last wannabe bar in Vegas"}
{"text":"Good food. Personal,  homie service. Not too packed. Good prices. Onion rings & the flat bread are really good & good for sharing. Salads are fresh. Come try it"}
{"text":"Our Meetup tried this bar restaurant for the first time last week. The service was very good the drink specials were very nice. We only have bar food so I cannot attest for any other type of food. We had the wings and the onion rings. I would say their typical bar food."}
{"text":"This has become one of my favorite bars to visit  on Saturday sunday and Monday the bartender Jon is very knowledgeable and he can make you shots for any occasion and he makes great drinks and conversation he gets to know you by your name and remembering what you drink they also have really good bar food and gaming this post is a little late but you won't be disappointed when you go there"}
{"text":"My soulmate and I went here for going to see Rogue one we didn't want anything too heavy so that we wouldn't have to go out to the bathroom and in the movie theatre. I walked into the bar area to see how everything looked there was a blonde at the bar very nice very helpful she looks as though she's probably getting exceptional bartender I went back into the area where the food is and I watch the gentleman who was making my food touching my food but she's in my grilled cheese sandwich with his bare hands. I walked out to the manager I asked to speak with them and we went back inside to the kitchen area and she said to him do we have gloves on the line as she asked them twice. And instead of making new food he continued to make my food and he didn't put the gloves on immediately he still made my soulmate chicken wings. A day passes hardly ate anything I don't really need anything due to my back pain with a responsible driver is hitting me and my entire back being in so much pain that I don't have an appetite and the following morning I woke up at 7 oclock am literally with a hundred and five temperature and puked my brains out every hour on the hour until 7 o'clock p.m. so I guess if Trina and other people are making bar food I'm sure it tastes delicious but be careful for the older gentleman and make sure he's got gloves on because food poisoning . Went to the doctor's today they said it was obviously some sort of digestive bug and now I have all kinds of antibiotics and steroids that I have to take and the closest thing that I had to food poisoning before with Salmonella poisoning in Ohio from drink and some Creek Water. So my suggestion is if you're going to order food make sure that all people are wearing gloves"}
{"text":"Neat little hole in the wall.  Great happy hour!  Food was good and excellent service.  Dawn is an excellent bartender."}
{"text":"My girl Sherry she's a great bartender Pleasant outgoing sincere person listens to all problems I recommend Dylan's Grill and Pub Las Vegas to everyone a great spot to kick it please check it out when Sherry's bartending!"}
{"text":"Chicken wings very fatty, served with frozen fries, clientle \"shaky\". Caters to \"low lifes\" . Once was enough for me. Thats all folks!"}
{"text":"I've been driving by this place for awhile now & been wanting to try their happy hour.  Well I finally made it in before 7 today.  Our bartender was Jennifer & she was super friendly & service was fast & attentive.  Food was great especially for the happy hour prices.  They were out of fries so they upgraded to beer battered onion rings so it was a win win. Browsed through the regular menu & prices seem pretty cheap there as well.  Drink prices were also good. I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"OMG!!!! BEST BAR TENDER IN VEGAS !!   Ron is the BEST !!! I have the best time here ! Me and my friends will always stay loyal ! Thank you Ron!"}
{"text":"Food and service is great so far. Decent pricing especially happy hour drinks. The one thing that was exceptional that prompted me to write this review was the 100 percent spotless and classy looking bathroom. It's clean for any public place, let alone a bar. Leaves me thinking this is a place that actually cares."}
{"text":"This by far has to be the best bar/grill in Las Vegas. Lori and all the other bartenders make you feel like a family. The buffalo wings were also very good one of the best places I have been. The only downside to this place is it is very smokey inside and there is not much ventilation. The customer service definitely makes up for it."}
{"text":"Dropped in here for a few beers and watch my friend gamble away her savings account. Its a small place, but clean. I didn't check out the menu so no food comments other than the guy next to me had a nice plate of wings and fries.  They have a small but good looking list of microbrews. I went with Hangar 24 wheat beer which was light and crisp with good flavor.   Service was just ok. There were only about 6 people at the bar, and when my first beer was empty I waited about 5 minutes before holding up my glass to get the girls attention. Getting our check also took some time as she was deep in conversation with some guy.   I might go back but as they had decent viewing screens for sports, 3 on the front wall and a couple on the sides. There is also a side seating area behind glass for eating."}
{"text":"This was a great place. Ww came here last week early June. First time here since it was a steelers Bar. Our waitress was very nice and service was good..  Happy hour specials were good to go.  Good pour on the dwell drinks. Didn't seem to be no skimping on the alcohol at Dylan's. My only complaint if you can even call it that was it gets a little smokey in there probably because I'm a non smoker."}
{"text":"This place is a cool ass spot. Trina is awesome and the bartenders Dawn Jen , and Kathy are fantastic. They have great fresh food and fantastic crafts beers. We stop in here on a regular basis and will continue to be there. Keep it up ladies you are Kick ass"}
{"text":"I live next door.  They leave ad cards on our car.  I call  to order and they don't answer.  I try again days later... no answer.   I check the number on the card and online.  Oh well.  No biggie - there are 16 thousand restaurants around here.  I left 3 stars because I technically haven't tried their food but it looks like typical bar food - frozen then fried."}
