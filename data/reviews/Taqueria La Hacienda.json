{"text":"Me and my bf and friend go went to job corps right down the street we had carne asada burrito with everything almost 3 days a week. They are only five bucks plus 2 for a soda"}
{"text":"Tasty authentic tacos. We were in town for only a couple days and I was told this was the place to get Mexican food. Did not disappoint. The carne Assad burrito is especially delicious."}
{"text":"I wish I could say they are great like everyone claimed but they are not. The tacos al pastor where not the real thing. way to greasy and the green chile burrito had no flavor to it."}
{"text":"5 stars for a good crane asada burrito that hit the spot."}
{"text":"Great, quick, tasty lunch spot! The tacos are very flavorful and service is quick. Bring cash-o-lah!"}
{"text":"Delicious tacos, normally fast service except on Sundays. Wait was too long for starving church go-ers. Overall good spot if you can get past the gang of chihuahuas that lerk at the kwik-e-wash next door. Plus side, if you take your date there on the weekend you can score a bootlegged dvd to watch at home. In all seriousness, really good authentic food at a good deal. Cash only."}
{"text":"After coming home from a concert down town this food truck was so good the pastor tacos are the bomb. There horchata taste very authentic. Everything was in expensive! I definitely will be back for late night cravings."}
{"text":"Taco Truck! This is the right way for this yanqui to start this trip in AZ. Stopped late in the evening after getting my car rental. Place is classy - parking and picnic tables.  Got 2 carne and 2 carnitas tacos. Both really good, classic tasting tacos. Real tortillas. The only thing that's missing is some music. Def stop by after you rent a car."}
{"text":"The carne was good, but not al carbon... As close to real Mexican Street tacos as I have found here in Phoenix. The tortillas however, excellent. Real hand made tortillas helped push this from an above mediocre meal to pretty darn good. We had carne asada tacos and the chicharron, my husband got the carne asada burro. The chicharron was better than the carne asada. All in all, pretty good. What would have put this over the top would be if they had really grilled the meat. In the end though, we'll be coming back for more.  Oh! One last thing, for 1 burro and 6 tacos, the bill was around  18 bucks. So not bad."}
{"text":"This is a Taco Truck right next to the Meat Shop on Buckeye Rd in Phoenix (address approximate). The Tacos al Pastor are a must try. Homemade, handmade tortillas. Fabulous pastor. excellent carne asada."}
{"text":"Man, I think I found my new taco spot. Yeah that's how good it is. I had the asado, pollo, carnitas, and pastor tacos. Very good."}
{"text":"Its a food truck in a parking lot in a shaddy area of town?! Can it be that good?!  YES. YES IT CAN! If you are near by, stop and eat here. In a rush? call them and place an order, it will be ready when you get there.  My favorite is the Carne Asada Quesadilla \"with Everything\". SOOOO GOOD!!!  Warning: Cash Only."}
{"text":"Very good spot for cheap late night food. I was in Phoenix from out of town, and was just looking for cheap food to eat late at night. Taqueria la hacienda did not disappoint! For $5 I received a carne asada burrito that couldn't be beat. Everything at this food truck is delicious- you really cant go wrong. Just remember that take CASH ONLY!"}
{"text":"I loved this place, but the past 3 times I've been here they have been letting me down. I ordered a chicharrón burrito and the beans tasted like they were rancid, unfortunately I had ordered to go. The next time I have it a second chance and the lettuce/cabbage tasted like it had been sitting in water for a month. It was also as bad as the previous time. Finally gave up on burritos and ordered a tripa taco. I asked for them extra fried but to my surprised they were barely fried. 3 times in a row they have let me down"}
{"text":"Taco Truck! yaaaaaas! They make their tortillas fresh. I had lengua and asada. Both were great. Good service, friendly. I don't live in Phoenix but will make the drive for tacos haha."}
{"text":"Seeing all these amazing reviews has me really second guessing why I turn to yelp. I'm not exactly sure if this is constant issue, but there were flys ALL OVER just landing on & around you & your food which from the beginning made me question what I was doing there. This taco cart really is not that great! I ordered a carne Asada & al pastor taco. The  flour tortillas were obviously freshly made, but lacking that special something of a homemade tortilla. I've gotten better tasting carne Asada at filibertos so I'm so confused why everyone is praising it. My al pastor was better than my carne Asada but weirdly chorizo-y tasting and crispy. The prices were decent & the size of the tacos were also decent so better than a one star rating for me."}
{"text":"This is a wonder place. You enjoy the cool sitting outside. I have never had better Mexican food. There is a huge variety of tacos, tostadas , and burros.  Es una lonchera  que tiene comida de primera calidad. Hay mucha variedad. Muy muy sabroso todo."}
{"text":"This is THE BEST place to get authentic Mexican style street tacos.  The tacos Al Pastor are amazing.  There are many other restaurants in the valley that are nicer and have good mexican food.  There is no place that has a better street taco.  Totally worth sitting outside when it is 100+ degrees."}
{"text":"Muy buenos tacos!!  Solo aceptan dinero en efectivo y por lo tanto no cobran impuestos, así que chilo!  Chequen las fotos. Solo $10. Tacos a $2 y soda a $2.  Los de Ta' Carbón están mas buenos, pero aquí es mas de pasadita.  Recomendado!  Neta que los gabachos tragan lo que sea, hasta mierda!! No conocen lo que es bueno."}
{"text":"I placed a to-go order for carne asada burrito de chili verde and carne asada quesadilla. Food had good flavor, service was quick, and there's some covered outdoor seating."}
{"text":"This is what I have been looking for a good mexican food spot since I moved out here 3 years ago finally found it"}
{"text":"Always on point no matter what time of day. I drive from West Phx to eat at this taco truck. Love the carne asada and pastor tacos, hubby loves the carne asada quesadillas and chicharron tacos. Food is always quick, hot, and great tasting. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"This food truck on what is mainly a parking lot on Buckeye Rd. near 7th Street serves really tasty, inexpensive  tacos to go or to eat at your leisure in the covered area next to the truck. The tacos come with fresh cucumber slices and a fried jalapeno and can be spiced up with the sauces that come in the standard plastic squirt bottles. I tried the asada, pastor, carnitas, and lengua tacos and they were all excellent. I also noted that while lengua tends to be on the dry side in most other taco places I've tried, La Hacienda takes the time to slow-braise the lengua so it comes out tender and juicy. This is one of the fastest and most inexpensive meals you can get in the near-downtown area."}
{"text":"The most righteous steak taco I've ever had outside of Mexico. My new must-visit every time i come to Phx."}
{"text":"This food truck serves some of the best Mexican food in the area. Their burritos are a very good size and very well priced. My work is close to this place so I come here often. They are always very busy. Their service is good and they are courteous and professional. From my understanding, this food truck has been at this location for quite some time now. I hope they stick around forever!"}
{"text":"Great spot after airport and picking up a rental car! The reviews weren't lying. The food was delicious and was just perfect for hungry travelers. The ladies working the truck were very friendly and chatted with us. They offered suggestions of their most popular items and they were delicious. Lots of outside seating with shade. Pet friendly. Cheap eat and nice and quick!"}
{"text":"I had the Carnias and Asada Quesadillas, they were amazing! So good with everything on them, great flavor and portion size. I am a fan. The apple soda was really good to!"}
{"text":"Can't beat there carne Asada , been going there with the family for 5 years now . Besides a 50 cent hike on the prices of burritos. . This place keeps it real , no boiled carne Asada flavor . And I've never had bad lengua ! Which can go wrong if not prepared correctly . Que riqiusma !!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican carne asada quesadillas I have had in Phoenix. This place is cheap, the people are nice... well that is all you need I guess! Not sure if they even take cards, the food here is just super authentic."}
{"text":"Their tacos are really good.  This is one of my favorite places to go eat tacos.  Customer service is good."}
{"text":"Quick, tasty, many options and overall a super pleasant experience. Stopped by here on my way to the airport and enjoyed a pair of amazing tacos, one lengua, the other chicharron... the lengua was very subtle and the chicharron was very bold, crispy and flavorful. Everything is done just right! My friend picked up a pastor I think, and it too was delicious. Can't beat tacos like this, made like it would be back home!"}
{"text":"Yes I might be a fatass but I being from LA I know Tacos.  They dont put enough meat on the tacos.  I got 4 tacos and usually that is enough for me,  some places 2-3 are enough.   I ate 4 tacos and swear I could have had 4 more.   No meat on the tacos.  Tasted very good and the green salsa is bomb but they need more meat on the tacos especially considering they are so expensive here.  $2 a taco sounds like a meaty taco.  Not a tiny meatless taco.    I will say the tortilla they use is amazing."}
{"text":"Homemade tortillas, super tasty tacos, outdoor seating. Lots of selection. Authentic. Shade structure. This is the real deal. Perfect."}
{"text":"This place is excellent! Affordable, good service, fresh food, great ambience - I feel like I'm part of a neighborhood hang-out."}
{"text":"Best tacos!! Soo yummy!! Carnitas are my favorite! Love coming here ! Never disappoints."}
{"text":"This has to be the best Mexican food in Phoenix. Authentic and delicious beyond belief! So reasonably priced too! Carne Asada tacos were amazing...go here!!!"}
{"text":"The times on here are off, I was there last night around 7pm, this site said closed but I called to verify it was open. I love their tacos with handmade tortillas, I usually get the pastor tacos. They were good as usual but I was a little disappointed that when I said to-go, all they did was plop down my small salsa container and a couple of cucumber slices and one wedge of lemon inside my same taco container. They have always put this on the side in a small baggie. Not cool"}
{"text":"One of the best spots in phoenix to eat late night street tacos. Lots of covered seating, and heaters in the winter! Food comes out fast and hot, they accept custom food orders and carry a full range of Mexican bottled sodas and a wide variety of protein's to choose from. Visit here any night for great eats your budget wont even notice."}
{"text":"Have tried to make sense of all the 5 star  reviews but I guess for phoenix this is better than nothing.  have eaten here several times just to make sure of my posting I find the food here alright, the trip as are not rinsed from the inside so you get all the crunchy cowshit to enjoy.  The chicharon was a mystery meat not good at all, lemgua overcooked, Chile verde not what I expected.  And so forth on the other items Al in all the food looks nice but is rather bland."}
{"text":"We came here after we flew into Phoenix. Amazing! The location seemed sketchy but the food was delicious and the people working the food truck were really nice. I got the burrito de Chile verde and it was some of the best Mexican food I've ever had. Their guacamole is in the green bottle and it is awesomely scrumptious.  I would definitely recommend coming here."}
{"text":"We love this place! The tacos al pastor are the best we've ever had! We also love the carne Asada tacos and burritos! We order ours with no cabbage. We drive from Surprise to eat here that's how much we love it! Homemade tortillas! Be prepared to eat outside as its a food truck, but there's tables and a shade covering!"}
{"text":"One of the best carne asada burritos I have ever had! Great food at a great price and made hot, fresh, and fast!"}
{"text":"My first visit to this small food truck in south Phoenix was by accident, on Labor Day weekend. Since then, I've been in HEAVEN! This is my favorite place for tacos, hands down. Tacos are $2 each (tax included) and come with lettuce (iceberg), onions and cilantro. Also, the salsa and guac are DELICIOUS! There is usually a small paleta cart at this location, which is a nice way to finish off your meal, especially if you bring kids. Food is great and the staff are friendly! I live in the west valley but am more than willing to make the drive out here!"}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food in Arizona. Bar none. This taco truck has made my life unmanageable. I currently attend Taco Truck Anonymous meetings but I'm relapsing right now. So good."}
{"text":"While visiting Phoenix, I knew I wanted to go to a Mexican restaurant since in my head, it seemed like it would be more authentic than Mexican food on the east coast. We borrowed bikes from our downtown hotel and headed over since I heard it was the best in town. The locals stared as if we were lost but we jumped right in. The whole menu is in Spanish so my fiend and I googled everything before ordering but the tacos were really good and really affordable."}
{"text":"One of the best Taco trucks in Phoenix hands down!! If your going to a game or event and want a quick satisfying meal, then grab some tacos and a drink and you'll leave with a smile! The meats are fresh, moist and flavorful! It seems like they make their own corn tortillas which is an added bonus!   My favorite is the fact they give you chopped cabbage instead of lettuce on the tacos and sliced cucumbers and chilies on the side! The carnitas are my favorite, but from the cabeza, pollo, lengua or pastor you will not be let down.  Remember to bring cash, no debit or credit cards accepted here...."}
{"text":"This place was very good we found this on yelp and decided to give it a try and we weren't disappointed."}
{"text":"Finished a hike on south mountain and wanted tacos, yelp to the rescue, this place was great!! Yummy tortillas and delicious fillings! Bring cash...."}
{"text":"Pretty dang good tacos. Tried them for the first time today. Husband ordered carne asada and I had al pastor. I tried one of his carne asada tacos and I def favored the al pastor because it had more flavor. These are not your typical minuscule (two bites and it's gone) tacos. They're actually a pretty decent size. Served with a side of guacamole (a bit watered down for my taste), red salsa, limes, grilled jalapeños, and cucumber slices. They offer various types of tacos, so I'm interested to see what the others taste like. Will def stop by again."}
{"text":"Best Carne Asada and Pastor Buritto that I've ever had.  I prefer no cabbage and it's amazing for only $5.50 (accept cash only).   I live far from this spot but drive out here weekly from NE Mesa."}
{"text":"If i Only could give it 10 Stars!!! Best tasting tacos and tortas. My husband always has the Carne Burrito, but I have not really taste it... I am always just so obsessed with my \"Torta con Pastor\", that I really can't pay attention!!!! My 15 yo daughter can put away 5 of their pork tacos (carnitas or pastor, based on her mood) and can finish off my torta.. This girl can eat and rightfully and especially so... here! Everything is spicy as it should be, so be prepared! We also love their green  \"avocado salsa/sauce - so if anyone from the Taqueria is reading - can we please have the recipe? Pretty please with a taco on top!  That is all folks - just some of the best real Mexican food around!"}
{"text":"I've been visiting this place since it opened on 1st st near check cashers before it moved to it's current location.  This is THE roach coach we visit most often when a craving for a burrito hits and Filibertos is not enough!  The carne asada is always grilled with a great char flavor, I usually get the carne asada burrito or tacos although I\"ve also tried the torta.  Other items I've tried and liked greenchile/cheese burrito and chorizo breakfast burrito.  My kid also likes their shrimp ceviche tostada.  All the items I've tried have been satisfying.  If you visit this place don't get turned off if someone comes by asking for money.....Once in a while they will have homemade horchata and that's not bad either.  Love their bottled sodas and the prices are very decent for the flavor and load of food you're given.    Since it's outside it's super hot in the summer, so be warned to take it home or buy some very ice soda to sip on while enjoying your meal!"}
{"text":"The search for awesome tacos led us here. The appearance may be unappealing, so you MUST overlook that. It is simply a food truck in an empty lot, with some tables with benches under blue tarp for shade. The truck is painted with \"Taqueria La Hacienda,\" located just east of the ally next to The Meat Shop at 2nd St. The tacos come with your choice of meat, plus onions & cilantro. Everything is chopped tiny, which is a plus for me. They have guacamole, red, and green sauces in squeeze bottles. Didn't try the green, but the red and guac are both good. The al pastor is the BEST I've ever had. It was so crispy and delicious! I wish I had a burrito full of it! The asada was also good, as well as the lengua according to my husband. The drink selection was okay: regular Coke cans, bottled water, Mexican bottled Coke (YUM!), and a few different bottled Jarritos. According to their menu, they have breakfast items as well. They are there Monday-Thursday 8am only until about 12pm/1pm, but weekends stay late into the night (2am-ish I think). This is definitely the place to hit up after partying on Fri/Sat nights and well worth the drive from the north valley!"}
{"text":"Had my hopes held high, was let down. Much better tacos around the area. The price was fair, and the people where very  nice that's why I give it 3 stars."}
{"text":"Was in the area and needed a place to eat before dropping off my rental and decided to stop off at Tacos La Hacienda.   Not much can be said about Tacos La Hacienda except that it's a converted lunch truck made into a \"restaurant\" with some patio furniture, a tarp to provide shade, and an old TV playing Univision.   Tacos La Hacienda has all the items you would expect from a lunch truck - tacos, burritos, toratas, etc. Most items here are $5 and under and it seems like a popular spot as many people where parked here having a late lunch/early dinner.   Looking over the menu - decided to get the chicken torta. The food took about 10 minutes but when I got it - was worth the wait. The torta was stacked with freshly grilled chicken and lettuce with a nice sauce to eat. They also grilled the bun and must have put butter on it as it gave a nice crispy buttery taste to the sandwich. The also had some house made sauce on the table that had a nice little bit to it and added a good amount of flavor. It was an excellent torta.   As to ratings - it's a good cheap eats spot. Nothing worth driving to - but something worth considering if you're in the area. More like a 3.5 rating but wouldn't object to eating here again - so rounding up to a 5 star rating for Tacos La Hacienda."}
{"text":"On the search for an amazing family owned taco truck? Look no further! Haha just kidding for the cliche intro. However I was out hitting the town with my buddy who actually grew up in the hood in Phoenix, usually these are the people you want to actually give you a tour. I asked him, \"Josh where can I find an amazing taco truck in Phoenix??!\" He answered \"you mind going to downtown?\" I replied \"Not at all!!\"  On our quest going through some back streets to end up at not only just a food truck but a well laid out dining area. Set benches, comforting awning, and extremely nice, cultural customer service! I ordered just a regular steak burrito with a Jarrito to wash it down. I sat down to go wait for my food and after waiting not even two minutes the nice lady came out with my burrito, Jarrito, jalapeño, and guacamole sauce.  Gauc-Sauce?!? Are you kidding me what's that! I love guacamole and everything avocado however this is like no other. My burrito was tightly packed, nice and big, and contents cooked and seasoned extremely well. After my explosion of a first bite I reach for that Guac-Sauce in a condiment bottle and pour some on to see how this rates in my book of sauciness (10/10.) Second bite! Wow this is dynamite. That sauce was amazing! I could not get over how delicious it was. I ate until I was full and happy. Best thing about it, it was such a good portion that I still had some left. Wow thank you and gracias guys! Perfecto."}
{"text":"Amazing food! So good for the price! REALLY friendly people. Highly recommend! Carne asada tacos are great and the burritos are huge. Yelp wants me to keep writing but there's nothing more to say. Super good. Really good. Like totally good."}
{"text":"Seriously the best tacos I've had in AZ! It is in a shady area and some of the patrons looked pretty suspicious (one was open carrying a pistol). Just be careful, aware, and respectful. The tacos are definitely worth feeling uncomfortable for a little while."}
{"text":"This place saved my life. The boyfriend and I were wasted, lost, and starving downtown when this place shined like a beacon out of the darkness. I had the chile relleno burrito and he had 4 carne asada tacos with a coke and our total was only 11 bucks. Seriously the food is amazing, and I will venture back soon."}
{"text":"I love tacos. Period. End of story. I will go to great lengths in search of good ones. Today's adventure led me to one of those Mexican food trucks in a, shall we say \"industrial\", part of Phoenix south of Chase field. You know, the kind that took over a vacant lot somewhere. Several meat choices served 5 ways (taco, burrito, etc.). Just a few non-Americanized toppings and great tacos on homemade tortillas! Four tacos and a soda for $7! Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"The problem with this food truck? It just 5 minutes away from my house! My husband and I tried this spot after a Chow-Bella article named it one of their to ten taco places in Metro Phoenix.   It's quick, cheap, and seriously tasty!  We tried the asada tacos and pastor tacos. Both are delicious ( and surprisingly filling), but pastor was my favorite! Also on the menu are vampiro tacos. That's right, the local to AZ and Mexico specialty...vampire tacos! I have no idea what this means, but I will be returning to try them.  Now, to go try the other tacos on that list."}
{"text":"Great food, low prices, easy to order, and friendly staff! I drive a good ways too eat here and will again."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with my little family and I have been looking for a good bus to eat some amazing food at. WE FOUND IT!! amazing food and quick service. nice little set up and sitting area. I wonder if it gets crazy at night?"}
{"text":"This taco truck is lit. Give it a chance if you like food that's bomb and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Still looking for a solid taco place. I had high hopes for this place. Although it was good, it was not great. I am a huge fan of tripa, buche, and lengua tacos all of which were delicious! Only downside is they are a bit greasy so the tortilla falls apart and hard to eat. The plus is the tortillas are hand made corn tortillas. The carne asada was not seasoned so it was a bit bland. I will for sure come back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite burrito in phx. They've been doing it for years and it shows. Just a little ole food truck and some real people."}
{"text":"Let's see, delicious street tacos for about $1.50 each.  Um...  Yeah!  Now you need cash, which seemed annoying, until I saw that they lived in a van down by the river...  Ok, it is Phoenix so there is no river only hot dry air.  A van down by the dried out canal.  The location is a hair dicey and ENglish is not the first language, pero no problema.  Merece la pena.  I ordered three different tacos and enjoyed every one of them, although the carne asada was my favorite.  I also enjoyed a delicious quesadilla.  I also recommend going to the circle k down teh stree to get your drinks..."}
{"text":"I only tried the carne asada tacos and they were very good. This place isn't too far away from my house so we'll be going here more often. The parking is great and the set up is nice. It's a food truck so don't expect great ambiance but it worked for me. Also the prices were very reasonable."}
{"text":"I got three tacos:  chicken, asada, pastor. Not good. Cheap quality. Not flavorful.  Bland. The staff was unfriendly. Just yucky poor quality tacos. My quest for the best taco on town continues!"}
{"text":"Best chicharron burrito in Phoenix for sure.. been eating at this place since the mid 90's"}
{"text":"I've been eating here for years, food is always excellent, from the carne asada burritos, tortas and tacos highly recommended"}
{"text":"We came here after an art show on a Wednesday night at the pressroom and it's just what we needed. Only open from 9-11 pm tonight (2 hours).  But if you find yourself around this truck it's some good eats for a great price.  $1.50 tacos, $5 burritos. Cash only"}
{"text":"Nothing says late night good eats like a taco stand.  i would feel somewhat defeated if I were to return home without the satisfying feeling of having had a good meal.  i am not referring to a greasy mess of available at a local college hangout or a dingy drive-thru.  I am talking about some well priced, made-with-care food.  Tacos La Hacienda provides this.  Nothing but outdoor seating, so I don't know if I would show up in the winter time, but when the weather is warm and inviting, this is a certain destination for me.  I opted for the tacos, carne asada, lengua, and chicken, with everything of course.  I was so close to ordering the breakfast items, which are available all day.  But I was quite happy with my selection.  Good amount of meat and pico de gallo stuffed in.  Bottles of guac and savory hot sauce are available when dining in, in as in outside."}
{"text":"These are tasty tacos. pastor and cucumbers tacos are very good to eat. Yummy. Carne asada is second best. but if you bring your own beer (be discrete) you won't care about which is best.   ps. What do you call Mexican food while in Mexico? ... Food!"}
{"text":"Delicious! I recently moved from Las Vegas to NYC and the disappointment I've felt eating Mexican food in NYC is unexplainable... So I had a layover here in Phoenix and decided I need to fulfill my cravings for authentic Mexican food! This place was exactly what I need I had to carne tacos and 1 lengua although they were both tasty the lengua was so tender and salted perfectly.. I can't wait to get another Phoenix layover   Side Note: the adorable girl selling snacks, collecting bottles, and clearing tables for her summer \"job\" is a real business woman Tip her! :)"}
{"text":"Came here right after we landed in Phoenix.  The location feels a bit sketchy and I didn't realize it was a food truck, but the food is really good and the people running the food truck is really nice.    My boyfriend and I both got the al pastor burrito (his with everything and mine without the hot sauce) and we both loved it.  The portions were a bit big for me but really no reason to complain there."}
{"text":"Nothing negative to say:  Delicious carne asada, cabeza, pollo, lengua...so many reviews that only talk about JUST the carne asada. The menu is a bit more expansive than that. Minus the tripe (not a fan of it), there isn't anything on the menu I wouldn't recommend. Brought some foody friends here who know a good eat and they were very skeptical at the idea of arguably the best Mex in Phoenix being out of a truck. After some burritos and tacos, the critics were silenced. If you're in the area and you don't stop here, you are doing both yourself and your wallet a disservice."}
{"text":"Came in after a Dbacks game for tacos.   We ordered 6 tacos and 2 sodas for 15.00. Thank goodness it was cheap as we don't normally carry cash. Order was ready within 5 minutes.   Tacos were awesome. We tried pastor and carne asada with everything on it (onions, cilantro, cabbage).  We added lime and salsa. Def worth coming back for. Tortillas were perfect and not too thick.   This place is outdoors and shaded. Nothing too fancy, but the food makes up for it. All customers there were there for the tacos too!!"}
{"text":"Most of my friends know I don't usually eat Mexican food...especially taco. However, my friend has been bragging about how good their tacos were for months now. Since I'm in the area, well why not?   We drove thru a scary neighborhood. Then he pulled into this small parking lot with a huge food truck sitting at the corner with a small covered dining area. They don't have a huge menu to choose from, so I ordered two Asada tacos. The order came with a small pepper, lemon, 2 pieces of cucumber and 2 bottles of sauce for tasting. I believe one of them is hot sauce and I have no idea what the other one was....  I kept looking over my shoulder. Then, one bite into their tacos and I immediately forgot all about my scary surrounding. IT WAS SO FREAKING GOOD!!!!! The taco was only less than $2 each and I finished them within 5 minutes. The Asada was so flavable, well seasoned with lots of cilantro and onions. Meat portion was very generous for the price. I'm pretty sure I inhaled them. After this trip to the taco truck, I'll never look at taco the same way.   I'll definitely come back here again."}
