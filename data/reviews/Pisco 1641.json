{"text":"I don't know how long ago this restaurant opened but I'm surprised that so far it's gotten only one review and a very positive one at that.  I'm glad that the host for our party of about 16 people decided to give this place a try and it was a pleasant treat. I've never had proper South American food based on traditional dishes so I was very eager to go along and check out this place. I was already starting to get tired of the more commonly available snack-style line up of empanadas, churros, burritos and tacos. So being able to dine at Pisco 1641 was a chance to try out something that is specific to one region in South America.  So the menu that we looked at that evening was quite different from the list on their website,  I can only describe the taste of my choice for that Saturday night: the \"Asado y Huancaina\",a very tender, braised beef short rib on a bedof thick and hearty pasta called Pappardelle. To me, it was the one dish that stood out. Everything in that dish was well-seasoned. As soon as I tried the pasta I immediately got a good kick of something spicy and I thought it came from the sauce that accompanied the dish. Later I was told that the pasta contained a type of cheese and some kind of chilly pepper. I taste of that spicy heat was soothing because it was a rather chilly evening and I was still feeling cold when I arrived at the restaurant. The other dishes that came out were also well-presented, once our host shared the pictures that she took with the group of us. One of my table mates had the \"Suado a lo Macho\", hearty looking tomatoey seafood soup with a softy consistency jasmine rice. It looked very soothing and you could proper shapes of seafood that didn't look like they over overcooked and disintegrating into the soup.  I really hope that quality of the food at this place will remain stable. I certainly enjoyed my meal and I never really heard much a complaint about the food from the other members at our table. It would seem that the dishes appealed to everyone's eyes and tastebuds.  The only concern that most everyone had was the time it took for the meals to get to the table. The group met at the Pisco around 7pm. I was the last person to get there because of work-related st backs. I was about an hour and half late to the point where I joked about getting my meal to go if everyone was already eating, and I got there close to 8:30pm. Everyone was still waiting their main courses so I was still able to get my pick and pleasantly it arrived around the same time as the others' plates.  I would certainly recommend this place to people who might want to try our something that is different from he other restaurants in the area. For me it is a sure winner and it has a very intimate ambiance if someone wants to bring their date for a romantic evening over some unique Peruvian based dishes."}
{"text":"Amazing Peruvian restaurant!  Unlike most of the rustic Latin American restaurants that I've seen in Toronto, this one has a modern concept yet stays true to Peruvian cuisine. The atmosphere is relaxed but sophisticated at the same time. The quality of the dishes is great because they import all their ingredients from Peru. The butterfish ceviche is my favourite ceviche so far! Restaurants rarely use that fish for this dish, and these guys do it right. The pisco sours are also delicious and they come in different flavours. Honestly, I haven't tried anything that I didn't like. It is an excellent restaurant to sample a wide variety of dishes that are part of Peru's rich and booming cuisine. It resembles the kind of modern hip restaurants that you would find in Lima. Very well done!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love Peruvian food. We were delighted to see good reviews and made a reservation to have dinner. Despite being a weekend the place was fairly empty. There is a bar in the front where music was playing and a range of tables along each side in the back.   The menu was small on a sheet of paper. I thought the appetizers were the most interesting as a few of them looked more like main dishes.  In the end we shared an appetizer and tried a standard Peruvian dish, Lomo Salt Ado,( $21) which arrived without Aji , the classic pepper sauce!  No Peruvian Canario beans ... not badly prepared but really nothing to return for either.   But the Pesco sours were great...and I did have a few.   Approx. $120 with tip and went home hungry."}
