{"text":"Great late night Thai spot! Chicken Green curry was fresh and flavorful! Beef Masaman curry was mild and tasty! To top if off the mango and sticky rice dessert was fabulous! The service was fast and friendly! This is definitely a spot we will come back to when we have a craving for Thai!!!!"}
{"text":"You know you're in trouble when the best thing about your meal is the cool box it came in. Pretty mediocre Thai food (comparable to any Thai food found in a mall). Fairly expensive for the small to medium portions provided. Was quick, so good if you're in a hurry."}
{"text":"This place has a good concept and an awesome location. $10 for anything on their a la carte is a great deal. I've tried the Pad Thai as well as the Beef Masman Curry and both were delicious!  That said, both times I've visited Tuk Tuk Thai the salad rolls and green papya salads in the refrigerator didn't look very fresh and seemed as though they had been sitting there for a few days. The space could also use some more seating options if it doesn't want to be seen as just a 'grab and go' spot."}
{"text":"The food is average.  Definitely above average presentation/packaging, but be sure to check your order if you are getting takeout.  Got home and they had my order wrong (chicken instead of tofu), and when I went back there was no apology for the mistake.  I had the Swimming Rama and it was 80% rice (and plain when I had ordered coconut).  Overall, I've had better Thai takeout experiences at fast food chains like Thai Express in a mall food court."}
{"text":"The one thing you cannot beat at Tuk Tuk Thai is the price -10$ entree. I have had a few dishes here and they have all been very good.  We went in right when the place opened and by accident they gave us the wrong order. It happens and although we were upset I called and they were kind enough to give us a 10$ credit. We have had the curry, flames dish and the pad thai.   All were very good and the only reason why I wouldn't  give it a 5 star is that the food isn't very spicy.  I wish they would ask you if you wanted it mild, medium or hot.  Regardless, bang for your buck and quality of the product is why I would recommend this place Take note it is mostly a take out joint but does have some limited seating inside."}
{"text":"Love that there is another late night option on 17th Ave for quick, fresh and decently healthy food. Service is friendly and efficient. Smaller portion sizes but definitely better in flavour. Their food is served in beautiful cardboard shaped like a lotus flower when it is opened."}
{"text":"Had a curry and a crispy basa dish, preferring the spicing and texture of the latter. Quick service, nice packaging (recalling a flower), hot food, pretty good flavours, good rice, fair pricing. Mostly meant for takeout as the seating is limited and odd, this is a good choice for a quick bite of 17th Ave SW."}
{"text":"Good impression coming into this place. Friendly service, and a short wait of about eight minutes for our food. The Beef Masman Curry is a real winner. We would order that again! (Chunks of meat, potato, marinated in a delectable sauce). Not a huge fan of the Drunken Basa, but maybe that's because we compared it to the larger portion of meat in the curry. Would definitely like to visit here again and try some more dishes! Well done!"}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this place. First of all, any new take-away thai restaurant to open is good news but a place to get quick take-out thai at a decent price? This was even better news. But now I see why it is decently priced - their portion size. Their presentation is terrific I'll give them that, but when you open their little secret box, you find your normal rice portion, and only a few bits of meat with hardly any sauce. I think the pad thai is the exception, but if you get any rice dish be prepared to still be hungry after your meal. Their staff is super friendly and keen to make sure you have what you want but it would be better if I could justify the $10  towards a full meal. Would try again just in case it was an off day."}
{"text":"really enjoyed their pad Thai! I'll be back for more for sure. the fresh coconut water was also good (little on the small side though). moo moo lemon was a tad too spicy for me but Im looking forward to trying the rest of their dishes"}
{"text":"This is a great little fast food place on 17th. It's in a great location and their store is super cute with lots of authentic Thai pieces. They service was okay but slow. They food was good for what you pay for about $10 a dish. It's not the best Thai I've never had but for a quick bite I'd go back. I had the flames and a Thai ice tea. They were both good, like I said, for a cheap Thai place."}
{"text":"The food here is tasty and it's a place where I can bring my vegan daughter for lunch.  I love the gorgeous panel art on the north wall and the cute little Tuk Tuks used as drink coolers. It reminds me of our time in Thailand, taking a tuk tuk up the mountain to see the giant Buddha with the whole family. Who needs roller coasters when you have tuk tuks....HA! I only gave Tuk Tuk Thai 3 stars because the seating is strange. One long table, one small tall table ( with really short stools...I saw a customer eat his lunch here standing up rather than sitting on the stools because it's awkward), and scattered stools are not adequate. We sat at the end of the long table and froze because the only way in is via a sliding door and it was open a lot. I'm not even going to attempt to visit in the winter...though they do a great take away business."}
{"text":"Tuk Tuk is yuk yuk.  Hate leaving bad reviews but I wouldn't spend my money here.  Thought a crumby first time could be redeemed with a second time - nope. Probably my least favourite Thai place in the city so far.  Not enough of what you want but it doesn't matter cause it's not tasty anyways. Don't get the green curry. Both times it was mediocre AT BEST. Pretty much no sauce whatsoever - I had five bites and turfed it.  The service was meh . Our server couldn't have cared less that we were there.  Counter service by a man (Rohit) was the best thing about that place. He's great.  Thankful that my fridge has soya sauce in it so that my boyfriend could finish his meal... Most of it."}
{"text":"Tuk Tuk has been on my \"must try\" list for ages. Finally got my opportunity when we were looking for a place to have 1st dinner and pass a bit of time before 2nd dinner (I know I'm not the only one that does this lol)  Although catered towards take out (entrees come in cute lotus flower shaped boxes!), we were able to share an order of the veggie springs rolls and tofu pad thai at the bench style tables they have set up.  The pad thai was full-flavored, fresh and delish! At $10/entree, you're not breaking the bank and you're getting a great meal too!"}
{"text":"After waiting with bated breath, Tuk Tuk Creekside is finally open!  Featuring the same delicious menu as the flagship location on 17th, you can now enjoy all the pad thai, soups and rice bowls in the comfort of the 'burbs.  With an abundance of seating, including a table under their signature Tuk Tuk, you have the option to dine in. The venue is very clean, thanks to the attentive and super friendly staff.  The desserts are a must try, whether it be the fried bananas (coated in coconut and sesame) or the sweet mango sticky rice!"}
{"text":"Great food, VERY reasonably priced, friendly staff, and trendy interior. The take-away containers are convenient. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"A small place, that's beaming with bright colors (especially green). The addition of bright tuk tuk props adds character to the store.  The service was friendly, fast and knowledgeable of the menu items. We ordered Thai ice tea, pad Thai and a sticky rice with mango for desert.  The presentation was definitely nice especially the way the pad Thai was packaged (see my Instagram post). Although the pad Thai wasn't spicy even though the server told me it is. Regardless it has a nice balance of sweet, sour, and seasoning.  The Thai ice tea was superb. Strong taste from the tea and the sweetness from the condense milk. As for the sticky rice with mango, the rice was consistent in soft texture with the right amount of coconut. The mango could be better if it was more ripen.  Overall for the price, a little high for me even as a fast food. But food and service quality met expectations."}
{"text":"Der Geschmack ist gut! Ich hatte das Green Curry, das hatte gut Feuer. Was mich enttäuscht hat war die Menge an Reis und der geringe Anteil an Gemüse und Fleisch. Bezogen auf den Preis, $10, ist es okay, man kriegt hat was man bezahlt. Ein guter Ort um schnell an was leckeres zu Essen zu kommen, aber wer ordentlich Thai essen will sollte lieber ein entsprechendes Restaurant aufsuchen. Der Service ist super freundlich, es gibt ein paar Möglichkeiten zum sitzen und die Lage ist top, direkt auf der 17th, mitten drin."}
{"text":"Great food for great prices! Their Green Curry is my absolute favourite in the city. Not to mention their delivery is very speedy and arrives in very pretty packaging, bonus!"}
{"text":"This is okay fast food Thai that is reasonably priced. I would eat here again but am not excited about it. The Pad Thai and Cashew Chicken were okay but I would not choose those again. The Tom Kai soup was tasty but the inedible bits that are commonly in the soup (hunks of ginger,lemon grass etc.) were too small so I had to work to avoid them. Since i ate it at home i finished it off using a strained to remove the bits The flavour was good anyways.. The ambience of this casual little place was modern and stylish. The service and ordering system were good. I did not try the spring rolls but my boyfriend did and liked them. Next time I would order different things to try."}
{"text":"Super affordable. All of their entrees are priced at $10! I got the green curry - yummy, tiniest hint of spice, sweet and coconutty. My friends got the pad thai - if you ask for it spicy, it's kick-ass spicy haha.  Solid place, huge portions, and so prettily packaged!"}
{"text":"Pad Thai, Papaya salad and the basa dishes are my go to. Everything else was okay. I think it's good value if you have a hankering for Thai food and need food on the go."}
{"text":"Love grabbin' a bite at TukTuk and sitting outside to people watch (space and weather permitting). The prices are fair and the food tasty (including a decent variety of dishes). I've noticed the portions have gotten smaller as of recently. But the staff is pleasant and as said the food is good - so I'll be back :) the seating is a bit weird and limited, with only two big (super tall) tables inside, and two little (itty bitty) tables outside. The front door is an automatic sliding door which can make for a chilly experience if it's cold out. But it's neat either way. It's pretty funny to see people stand there for a second wondering how to get in."}
{"text":"4.5 stars, I recommend the- DRUNKEN BASSA- this is packed full of flavor and should be enough to fill you up. All the appetizers are tasty too! VERY fast take out service, every time I have ordered!"}
{"text":"Yes I am a fan indeed. I actually shared one order with my friend, which was the pad thai. The packaging was amazing. I mean lotus shaped container that opens like a flower? C'mon!!!! The Pad Thai was flavourful, enough for western taste buds. Will definitely come again when I am really hungry!"}
{"text":"We had a large family order and were pleasantly surprised how quick it was ready. All the dishes were great, very flavourful and generous portion sizes. The staff at the counter was very friendly and helpful. Highly recommended:)"}
{"text":"I've seen this place during my numerous passes up and down 17th Avenue over the months and always wondered about what the food tasted like.  Well yesterday I had the chance to pop by for a quick pad Thai which was really good and a papaya salad.    The papaya salad was fresh, crispy, and full of flavour.  A little on the wet sauce side but hey we did finish it easily.    The interior was quite mesmerizing where I caught myself staring at the giant Montage that you just don't see these days in food offerings around town.  The decorative mini cab vehicles were a nice touch.  Price was reasonable at $16ish for the two dishes total.  The pad Thai came in their signature take out box that opened like a flower blossom into a dish, kinda cool."}
{"text":"This place was okay but not great. I found the food a bit bland for thai food, and also lots of rice but not much sauce/meat.  I haven't come back yet..."}
{"text":"Two stars for the price $10 and packing the only good thing about this place. My green curry was spicy but had no flavour whatsoever. 4 tiny slices of dried out chicken carrots, cauliflower and broccoli???? Since when there's cauliflower, broccoli and carrots in green curry? No zucchini and no bell peppers as indicated on their menu. Food is nothing special. Cheap but not cheap enough for me to return."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised for a fast food counter style restaurant. I had the crying tiger and husband had the cashew chicken. The crying tiger was amazing! I only with the portions where bigger as I was debating licking the \"lotus\" (cardboard container which the food came in)   Decor was fun and inviting and staff where friendly. Would return more often if one opened closer to our house."}
{"text":"One would like it to be better, but we can trust your tastebuds, can we not? Went there to check it out, and won't return because nothing special here. Is almost good tasting, but not at all wonderful.  Having been to Thailand and eaten Thai in many other venues in AB and abroad, this fast-food just doesn't deliver. Too bad, but won't return."}
{"text":"How can you be a restaurant on 17th Ave and charge the prices that Tuk Tuk Thai charges, and provide tasty food with generous portions? I don't know, but I'm glad they're there! My group and I came here for an early dinner and ordered a large amount of food.  Hubs and I shared the satay chicken, chicken spring roll, papaya salad as appys and I thought everything was nicely flavorful and well executed.  I had the drunken basa as my main and didn't realize there was a bit of heat to it so it was a bit challenging to eat (I am very sensitive to spice) but it was very tasty.  My brother's masman beef curry had tender cubes of beef brisket, and the pad Thai's were a huge, generous portion with hints of tamarind sauce.  My brother's gf didn't enjoy her Moo Moo Lemon as the citrus taste was too overpowering for her.  Overall I think we enjoyed our meals and wouldn't hesitate to come back!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place since I heard so much from social media. This branch just opened in Creekside so I guess they're (staff) still practicing.   The choices isn't much which is a good thing so it's not very overwhelming.  We ordered spring rolls for appetizer, The flames for entree (coconut rice topped with beef and veggies cooked in oyster sauce), roti (I'm not sure what it is exactly but it's a dip fried pastry) for dessert, and thai iced tea for drink.   The spring rolls reminded me of the korean \"Kimali\" (noodles wrapped in seaweed and dip fried). Though,  this one is noddles wrapped in spring roll wrapper. I liked it because of what it reminded me and I like how it tasted too. I wasn't very keen on The Flames dish. There was nothing special about the beef and veggies- it's like something you can make at home. The rice was more than the beef and veggie so we ended up with rice without viand at the end. The roti was okay, sweet and nice. My favorite was the iced tea, it was lovely and refreshing.   I like the ambiance,  since it's new,  it's very clean. Though their service can be improved,  the food took longer than I expected for just a stir fry dish. But as I said it's a new branch. Maybe it'll get better.  The food packaging is really nice which they're known for and Tuk Tuk's trademark.    We'll come back here to try other mains. It's a good small hangout too."}
{"text":"Cheap and cute containers. Great location for inner-city residents.   Pad Thai wasn't flavourful, wouldn't order again. Coconut rice was overcooked. Chicken curry a tad tough, but the price can't be beat for fast food Thai food. I like the soup  - light, tangy and flavourful."}
{"text":"Located on the red Solid spot for Thai Food located on the red mile (17th Ave SW). I had the following:  Pad Thai with Chicken - delicious and the noodles were cooked perfectly Tom Yum with Chicken - very flavorful and spicy Drunken Basa - the sauce was so good lots of spices, make sure you mixed it all together  I really like the togo containers they put the food in."}
{"text":"It is very rare that thai food places I have had so far was bad and this place is no different.  Thai Fast food place. Very nice interior, they have have a tuk tuk taxi inside with beverages in it. Great choices on their menu. Don't have too many sits but since its a fast food, you grab, eat and go. I have tried their drunken basa dish. it comes in a cute little pack which you can throw in the garbage and not much cleaning up needed. Food was really good. It was sweet, sour and hot at the same time. Service was fast and friendly. Good place to try."}
{"text":"The food is a bit on the high sodium side so you can ask for less sauce (which helps a lot). The price is good for what you get however my two star review is due to the service provided. I get that it's a mainly \"self serve\" type of venue...but the cashier taking orders was very rude to me & my friend. I asked if I could substitute the rice in the dish for another option and she looked at me as if I just asked a big favor and mumbled something while waving towards the menu in the back. I also had a water bottle with me since I just came from Goodlife fitness and she said I needed to throw it away and purchase one of their waters if I wanted to drink water. Seriously?! I used to frequent this place a lot and now I would much rather drive farther to another Thai place and for better customer service."}
{"text":"This is a great little Thai place and I've been there a couple of times. The only reason they are only getting 4 stars is that the coconut rice is too mushy for me, I would give this place 4.5 stars out of 5. I prefer the jasmine rice. I overheard the girl at the counter explaining to new staff what coconut rice was and I think the rice is mushy because they cook jasmine rice and then pour coconut milk in to finish it off just before it finishes cooking, that sounds like too much liquid for the rice to me. So far I've had the tukky sticks, green curry chicken, and Kra Prao Beef (The Flames on the menu). The dishes come out freshly prepared and piping hot. The food has a nice spicy kick to it without being overpowering and if you like it really spicy they are happy to bring the heat up a couple of notches. This is definitely fast-food Thai as the tables and chars are large and meant to allow people to have somewhere to sit and eat and they seat between 8-10 people. There is one small table tucked in next to the tuk tuk. The chairs are more bar stools and the tables more like counters. The packaging is definitely eye catching and whether you stay or take-out your main dishes come packaged in cardboard containers that fold into a flower.  The flavours are fresh and authentic and I could smell the basil gently wafting through the hole of my flower box. Fresh and fast is what Tuk Tuk Thai is about. Prices are reasonable. There is always some pre-made papaya and mango salads as well as the Thai version of salad rolls waiting in the cooler ready to go. It's a small menu but what they have they do well judging from the items I have had. I'm going to enjoy going through the menu and ordering something different each time I go there."}
{"text":"Super cute addition to 17th! Love the decor and friendly service. The food smelt, looked and tasted delicious and I am excited to go back to try the rest of the menu! We had the lemonade and it was more tangy than sugary, just the way I like it!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is small and most of the menu are like fast food . We just wanna sit there and enjoy some spicy food. Unfortunately , we didnt have a chance to try"}
{"text":"So Happy 17th Ave aka (the Red Mile) got a new Take Out Thai Place, Tuk Tuk Thai, my new favourite on 17th, I went by a couple days before they opened, even though it was not open to the public, the owners gave me a few samples to taste, everything was delicious and tasty, and they told me their website was up and running tuktukthai.com , I checked it out and made a plan on what I would order first when they opened, so today July 9,2015 I went and ordered Beef Masman Curry w/coconut rice $10 and Ginger Prawns $4 and Fried Bananas $4 and Thai Iced Tea $3, my favourite drink in the whole wide world,...also bought a friend a fresh orange juice, had a hint of ginger. So it was all amazing, and a great value, the decor is amazing  as well, I posted some pics, I highly recommend this place! Remember only TAKE OUT, and everything is $10 or under!! Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Tuk Tuk is one of my favourite lunch spots when I need something to go, the place is adorable with lots of Thai decorations. The menu prices seemed typical for Calgary and are consistent across most of the dishes. It's great for takeout as the dishes come in cute lotus flower containers and they have handy bags for transport. I've recommended Tuk Tuk to a few different people and they've all really enjoyed their experiences."}
{"text":"Having been to Thailand myself, I know what good Thai food is: quick, cheap, and delicious.   Tuk Tuk Thai is a small place next to 5s17. I found the automatic sliding doors an odd choice, but the place was quaint and beautifully decorated with thai culture.  I ordered the chicken pad thai. It came in a very cool origami type to-go container and was aromatic and delicious.  Overall, great service and fresh, fast, flavourful food. This place will definitely be my new go-to for Thai food!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I are big fans and have returned several times to try the rest of the menu. Really great food. I mean - it seems simple but they obviously pay attention to details. Very delicate and complimenting flavours. Well thought out food is hard to find in a small fast-food type establishment. I just wish there were more options on the menu."}
{"text":"This place beats out Thai Thai any day. So happy to have a new take out Thai place on 17th ave. Pad Thai was delicious and on par with what I have tasted in Thailand. If they can continue with this high quality of food as they get busier and keep their service in check, I can see them doing very well!"}
{"text":"Service was very quick and friendly. The Thai soup was amazing! Everything else a little bit of flavour less"}
{"text":"Walked by this place at first and thought it was an art gallery haha. Tuk Tuk Thai is extremely nice and cozy. Decided to give it a try and was blown away by the flavours. I ordered cashew chicken with jasmine rice and my boyfriend ordered the Pad Thai. The chicken was amazing and so was the pad thai- extremely worth the $10 for sure.  The one downside to my visit was the girl who served us at the counter. She was nice but a little too nosy on the personal level which made me feel quite uncomfortable. She asked us many questions about our relationship like where we met, how we met, etc and made unnecessary comments. Other than this awkward situation, I'll be definitely returning to try out some other menu items!"}
{"text":"Tuk Tuk Thai's price ($10 for an entree) is comparable to the food court's popular pick of Thai Express by being a dollar or two more expensive. While the portions may be smaller, Tuk Tuk Thai makes up for it in quality. I ordered the Beef Masman Curry and definitely agree that it's worth the $10. The curry was flavourful and the beef and potatoes were tender. The only thing that could have been improved was more curry sauce! I would've had no complaints if I could've drench my coconut rice with more curry.  Along with that, my friends and I ordered the ginger prawns (2 in an order), chicken satay (2 in an order), and fried tofu as our appetizers to share so that we could try a few more things. All appetizers are $3 each, of which I found a bit pricey for the amount given. However, it was tasty enough that I would recommend trying out a few of the appetizers.  When I go to particular BBT shops in Calgary, I'm usually inclined to order the Thai milk tea (half sweet of course), so there was no hesitation when my friend recommended the Thai ice tea. It was the right level of sweetness and a good refreshing drink to finish off the flavourful meal. With an appetizer, main entree and a beverage, I paid $16. I would definitely recommend coming to Tuk Tuk Thai if you're craving some legit Thai food. It's also more affordable than the other dine-in Thai restaurants that you find in Calgary. Another bonus is that it's open late on Fridays and Saturdays, so it makes a great late night alternative after you stumble your way out of a eventful night at the nearest club/bar."}
{"text":"What a fun little spot to go get your Thai fix for a great price.  I'd only heard good things about this place, then following a late morning coffee just a few doors down, I decided to get some lunch. Before you knew it, I was walking in the door at Tuk Tuk Thai and pulling up a seat at the end of one of their tables. I sat by the door and was able to people watch while I had lunch (which I love to do).   Decent amount of choices on the menu, but not overwhelming. It's a takeout place so there are only a few seats available but the seats are great based on the fact this is a take out place.   I went simple today and ordered cashew chicken. It arrived in a super cute little flower shaped box. Good size, very flavourful.  I'm looking forward to returning and making my way through the menu. The service was good, lots of seating, food was great and price spot on."}
{"text":"So you are on 17th ave and you want something not so pricy on this block. You don't want to spend too much so come to Tuk Tuk Thai. The price of an entrée is about $11. Not bad. Food was good. I really like the take out box. Its in a bow flower shape and it opens in to a plate. Cool.   So I got the red curry chicken. Decent portion. Very flavorful. Tried their skewer. Not bad and comes in two. Great for sharing. Flavorful. I would say.   Also tried the mango salad. This is my favorite. Its different than how other thai place makes it. It doesn't have mango strings but mango chunks. At first, we were like is this authentic. But who cares if its authentic or not. It tasted really good. My favorite. The mango was nice and sweet. Also they were very generous on the mango.   Overall. Pretty good. The place is like a fast food style place. Seating is somewhat limited.  I do recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Definitely recommend this place. I ordered Tom yung soup and pad thai and they were exceptionally delicous at very very good prices. ($15 for both!). In my personal opinion....better than Thai Express"}
{"text":"I tried the base filet. This was deep fried fish in a bed of rice (coconut or jasmine) with some Shredded Lettuce. Really not good unless you added the tamarind sauce. Cheap and fast though."}
{"text":"This is surprisingly a great place for food on 17th Avenue.  Prices are decent, portions are large and the flavours are amazing.  You can either pay twice the price by heading further down the street to Khao San Kitchen or just come here. It's also a bit nicer than Thai Fusion Delight so this place is on the top of my list for 17th Ave Thai food. White Elephant is in its own category so it's hard to compare.  Granted, this isn't the full on restaurant setting but you're here for the food right?  If you're looking for a bite on 17th Ave and want to try something new, I would highly reco coming by to Tuk Tuk Thai. In fact, I may even drop by after work today.  We ordered the cashew chicken just to try something new - very flavourful and the green curry - absolutely delish.  Best part is that you have an option of jasmine or coconut rice. The coconut rice comes at no extra charge. Win.  Tuk Tuk, will see you tonight."}
{"text":"Staff were super friendly! Decor is super cute! Food delivered fast in these cute little boxes... a great place to dine in or eat out! The best part .. the food was amazing!"}
{"text":"UPDATE!! Second visit and my God, what a turnaround. First time here I got the krapow (basil) beef and it was bland, bland, bland even though I requested extra spicy, and the veg portion was coarsely chopped green pepper and there was just zero love there. I posted a review here at Yelp and the owner messaged me saying that he'd hired a cook from another (excellent) Thai place... I relented and tried the same dish today and wow NIGHT AND DAY improvement! Crazy hot, with nice long beans instead of those crappy bell peppers, and the taste profile was just perfect for krapow- salty and spicy and MM MM good! $10 gets you this bit of perfection with an ample serving of jasmine rice in a very cute paper container. So, so, so happy I gave them another chance- this was possibly the best basil dish I've had since my fave quick service Thai place went out of business in Toronto 15 years ago. Try it and ask for extra hot, you'll thank me."}
{"text":"Mediocre food.....and painfully slow service. And this is when they were not even busy.... there were two other patrons waiting for the food before us. At least three other empty tables were dirty...and no one came to clean them. I am not sure who is giving this establishment high ratings!!!???"}
{"text":"Good thing: the Beef Masman Curry with coconut rice is still delicious and the restaurant is so cute! Growing pains: I was first told there was no beef curry at all, only got two disposable creams worth of cream in my Thai Iced Tea, and my to go order came out as a dine in (but this was easily solved by getting me a take out bag). Service took about 10 minutes. Will visit again!"}
{"text":"Good friendly staff. But the food is very salty and just isn't good. I couldn't even finish my pad Thai. The soup was also too salty for my liking."}
{"text":"The great customer service from young man named Davis increased my star rating on this post.   My wife and I were pretty excited about the opening of this place and were pumped to try it! Sadly we were pretty disappointed. The small menu is actually quite appealing and made for an easier decision, especially with help and recommendation from the polite and helpful staff.   We ordered the Pad Thai (extra spicy), the candied cauliflower, the Tom Kha soup and the cashew chicken.   -The candied cauliflower was really good, quite sweet (hence the name), and I loved it dipped in Sriracha.    -One of their signature dishes, Pad Thai, was terrible. The noodles had the texture of rubber bands and it was lacking flavour, and after ordering it extra spicy there was actually nearly zero spice. The noodles were so bad I literally only ate about three bites before throwing it out.   -The Cashew Chicken arrived at the table in one of their awesome take out boxes but upon eating a couple bites it wasn't right. She sent it back, had it remade and ate about half of the mediocre dish.  -The Tom Kha soup had really good flavoured broth, however one bite of the chicken in the soup and I couldn't eat any more. It was extremely dry and tasted like thick, wet cardboard.   Overall it was a disappointing experience and my wife and I don't plan on going back, however, they are brand new, just open and possibly experiencing challenges that come with opening a new restaurant. We are huge supporters of small businesses and businesses in our local community. Maybe we'll give it another try in a couple months.  I should add...the atmosphere is awesome, really loved the design of the place."}
{"text":"After making my initial review the business owner contacted me and was very helpful to explain their process and offered me the suggesting of asking for more sauce next time.  I did that the next time I visited and was blown away by how much more flavourful the pad thai was.  It really boosted my taste experience and I've been back many times since (but always ask for more sauce).  One of the ladies that works at the counter suggested I tried the Beef Masman Curry.  OMG!! Now I have two favourites.  The beef masman curry comes with: beef (of course), potatoes and onions, all slow cooked in Masman-style curry.  It is delightful.  It's soooo good that I crave it almost every day when I drive by the restaurant.  I brought my dad here once and it was great because we split the pad thai and beef masman curry. Best of both worlds!  I also like how it stays open late, while the rest of the places on that block close down early."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite Thai place. Food is good and very friendly service. Just found out from Operations Manager. They will be opening few new more locations. Like one one them will be in Deerfoot City. so excited."}
{"text":"Cool concept - and prices are about right for the portions - pad thai is just a bit bland.  Needs some more peanut taste or something.  Potentially a curry pad thai - like in Toronto?"}
{"text":"Tuk Tuk Thai is probably one of my favorite places to go, and I definitely recommend it. It has so many options for anyone who is vegetarian, or even vegan as they use coconut milk (Just double check before ordering). I have tried every dish on the menu, and everything is just amazing and super flavorful. I have never had authentic Thai food before, but everyone who has tells me that it's like they're back in Thailand.  My two personal favorite dishes is the Green Curry and the Drunken Basa. The green curry is medium spicy but has so many vegetables and tofu (vegetarian option). The sauce was super flavorful and aromatic, and goes very well with their coconut rice.   The Drunken Basa is an amazing savory dish with delicious crispy Basa fish. Tastes amazing and lots of attention to details.  The interior is very nice and gives off a relaxing vibe; There's a giant Buddha painting on the wall, the furniture is wooden, very nice music, and the awesome Tuk Tuk fridge."}
{"text":"Went here the other day and tried the moo moo lemon pork....wow!!! So much flavour..I highly recommend getting rice on the side because u can choose to eat it later with something else as the pork and lettuce is almost a lovely warm salad. As usual the ice cream is amaze!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try the food at this place, and was disappointed. I ordered the devils chicken on coconut rice. The chicken had some good flavours going, however, it was just too salty for my liking. After a few bites the taste of salt becomes overwhelming. The coconut rice wasn't bad, but was lacking in any sort of coconut flavour - defeating the purpose of getting coconut flavoured rice.   My friend ordered the pad thai, which looked amazing! I was able to try some, but unfortunately the dish was just too sweet. We decided to try the roti for dessert, it wasn't bad but I probably wouldn't get it again - it just tasted like fried bread with drizzles of condensed milk. Nothing special.   The saving grace of this place was the nice staff, and interesting decor. However, this would be the last place I'd ever go for Thai cuisine again."}
{"text":"My fave Thai place on the go, I had been never disappointed with any of the options on the menu plus the packaging is so innovative"}
