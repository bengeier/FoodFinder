{"text":"We had a lovely evening dining at AJ's Cafe, the staff was very friendly, our server was superior and the food was great.  I love sitting on the patio and enjoying the atmosphere and jazz music."}
{"text":"Fabulous dining experience!  Beautiful resort setting in downtown Chandler.  We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner and the impeccable service that was provided by the staff.  My wife had the special pork shanks and I had the Delmonico ribeye, both of which were cooked to perfection.  In addition, the fresh pretzel rolls with honey-cinnamon butter was wonderful and the chicken corn chowder was fantastic.    Our advise...don't overlook this gem of a restaurant among all of the other restaurant choices in downtown Chandler."}
{"text":"We went here for Easter brunch. The food was pretty good and the selection on the buffet was great. It wasn't crazy busy either, which was nice! The reason for 3 stars is because the service was horrible. We saw our server Brooke two times. The first after we asked someone to find her and 2nd with the bill... She didn't come again, in between... I hope the restraunt can work on improving the service in the future."}
{"text":"We were in on a Friday night for our wedding anniversary.  We started with the grilled shrimp cocktail which was by far the best shrimp cocktail than we have gotten anywhere and the shrimp were HUGE.   We also each had a caesar salad, very large, could have shared one.  We ordered the ribeye steaks and they were the best steaks we have had anywhere!   They are served with a spicy butter on top, not too spicy, perfect for me.  The steak came with a huge loaded baked potato which also was perfect.  We also ordered drinks, my spouse had a margarita and I had Moscato.  Both were great.  Staff was very attentive and the manager came over and checked on us several times. Timing of the food delivery was perfect. We were there around 8 pm, no problems getting in, seated and were served timely.  There was seating indoors and outdoors and there was a DJ playing music outdoors.  It was a very nice atmosphere.  The only thing I would change is that they serve a pretzel type rolls with cinnamon butter.  We were not a fan of that, would have preferred traditional bread or rolls.  Other than that, it was perfect!  We will be back."}
{"text":"Went here again on Friday. Everything was awesome! You have to try the clam chowder they have here on Fridays, it's awesome. Took a few pics this time so everyone can get a look at what your missing!"}
{"text":"I took my niece this past weekend for dinner while listening to the Chandler Jazz Festival playing in the park.  Although we waited a very long time for our order, the food was great.  However, the service was horrible.  I found it strange that my 4 yr. old niece was offered the bar's happy hour menu instead of the kid's menu.  Despite the restaurant being half empty, I found it very hard to get my waiter's attention.  At one point I gestured and called out to him.  He looked at me, and kept walking.  Never came back or sent anyone over to ask if we needed anything.  At that point, all I needed was my check since dinner and dessert had long since been served and finished.  I finally asked the manager to close out my check.    I recommend this place if you have a lot of time and patience to burn."}
{"text":"The Hubby and I went here for their Sunday brunch buffet last week. They have LOTS of food available for only $16/pp. Pancakes, waffle & omelette station, pastries, breads, home fries, the list goes on. The only downside was we were the only 2 people there! I hope more people came after we left, if not that is a lot of food waste. Good breakfast! Have eaten here previously many times for their all you can eat prime rib buffets for 17/pp they used to have on Saturdays. Sad to hear they discontinued that service."}
{"text":"My husband took me to the San Marcos for the weekend as a birthday gift.  We stopped in to AJ's for dinner just after they opened.  I was a little concerned because of the prices for the food, but that was dispelled as soon as I got my burger.  The serving was really large and every bite was scrumptious.  The cup-o-salad was even awesome!  Caleb and John made a very special night even more special with their excellent service.  Caleb was incredibly polite, it was so refreshing.  Even the chef came out to make sure we were happy with the meal, and we complimented him immensely.  We had a wonderful time.  Thank you so much!!!  The following morning we had the breakfast buffet and were very pleased with the service and options as well."}
{"text":"It's the same stroy every time we go, you would figure that after seven years they would have their serving issues resolved, not the case.  The historic resort is an amazing backdrop for dinning and we truly try to give AJ's a chance. We typically stop by once a year to see if management has changed their ridiculous serving habitats, unfortunately they miss out huge here.  I can't comment on the food because we never get service and refuse to wait the normal 30 min before anyone notices.  Read the reviews on Yelp, they all seem to hit on this problem, hopefully the management of AJ's takes note."}
{"text":"Went with my GF yesterday to try their Sunday Champagne Brunch.  Price is $27.50 pp but they offer restaurant.com vouchers.  We were pleased and satisfied.  Not the greatest Sunday Brunch in the world, but fully satisfactory for the price.  If anyone is interested in the menu, just message me and I will share the details with you."}
{"text":"Delish food.  I had a $25 restuarant.com so we tried it.  The shrimp cocktail was so good we orderd a second one.  They grill the shrimp instead of steam.  The burger was large and jucy.  My husband has the roasted chicket and asparagus.  delish.  Next time we go, we want the shrimp cocktail and try some deserts. Not much more to say except really good food.  You should try it."}
{"text":"The hotel is lovely and it's a great setting for a Sunday brunch. We ordered the buffet and while it was good, it wasn't anything memorable for either of us. They definitely aimed to hit on high price points with an omelette bar, prime rib, shrimp, and lox, but then nothing was done exceptionally well. It was all \"ok.\" For the price point, I'd have liked to see something signature that was remarkable or memorable. Service was friendly but not attentive. I'd come back here for happy hour, but I'll look to other options for finer dining."}
{"text":"Went there for Mother's Day brunch.  I expect to overpay on Mother's Day but I also expect to get exceptional service and a few wonderful treats at the buffet.  The service went something like this:  Me \"I would like a cup of coffee please\" (to the server)  Server:  \"The coffee is outside, you go serve yourself.\"  Okay, normally I would not care but when it is Mothers Day and I end up paying over $200 for 4 people, I think they should bring me a cup of coffee.  Eventually someone realized they should at least refill my cup on the table.  The buffet was ordinary, deserts were nice so that was a good way to finish the meal.  But what really frustrated me was the 20% gratuity they automatically charged me before we ever sat down.  The ad for Mothers Day brunch said 20% on groups of 6 or more, we were 4 with one child under 4.  So not only should we not have been charged 20% extra for gratuity, I would have never tipped 20% for \"go get the coffee yourself\" service.  They never mentioned the extra 20% when I made reservations either, not that it would have discouraged me in any way but since we were a party of 5 I assume the person taking the reservation knew they did not need to mention it.  Very disappointing meal experience overall."}
{"text":"Prime rib buffet every Saturday. The service was horrible and food was mediochre...except the salad on the buffet. Great salad. $16 /person. Fyi kids menu is only good thru age 8. They have fruit as an option instead of fries.  Nice live singer in the background. The prime rib guy can cook your slice more in a skillet if u choose, as well."}
{"text":"I have been at Aj's  at  San Marcos Place several times for brunch and it is always good. The selection is good, quality of food good and service great. In fact our server Linda was very friendly and knowledgable of the area.  They have a great mother's day brunch! and a 40,s Jazz band that is very good"}
{"text":"Fantastic appetizers, shrimp cocktail is delicious. Amazing dinner service, with food to follow. You will not be disappointed with executive chef Aaron. The menu is perfect and everything is so good! Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"I love eating here! They are bringing out a new menu that I can't wait to try :) It's located in the hotel, but it's open to the public and the cafe faces arizona ave and is right off of the Main Street. The staff are always very friendly and service oriented! I would recommend the buffet breakfast for locals and in December '16 they will open the restaurant for lunch and dinner hours."}
