{"text":"I frequently ate at Vienna's Cafe (this place's previous name) and the afternoon tea sets were amazing. Now after changing names to Billy, I believe they got a new chef and now their afternoon tea sets (especially the HK style or Westernized dishes like french toast, deep fried pork chops) just aren't as great as they used to be :\"}
{"text":"This is my favorite weekend hangout place. The prices are good and the quality & quantity are perfect. I love the afternoon tea and breakfast there, but dinner hot dishes have good quality too!"}
{"text":"This place wasn't too bad in my books, and I came here occasionally for lunch and dinner for the past couple years. But my most recent visit here changed my mind and I will not be returning anytime soon and here is why:

I decided to order grilled chicken sandwich with potato salad from their afternoon tea menu. The sandwich was just passable- white sandwich bread with lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise, and chicken (which was on the greasy side, because they don't actually \"grill\" the chicken but pan fry it). The problem occurred when I was digging through my potato salad.. when I found a half-bitten piece of potato. Seriously??! Is this restaurant serving their customers leftover, scrap food from other customers' plates??! Wow, this is beyond unacceptable and absolutely disgusting, to say the least.. Why ruin your business reputation with such cheap, dirty cost-cutting ways??"}
{"text":"This place has consistently been a safe choice for a quick & decent meal. Half of this HK Cafe is a bakery - I've never ventured into it, so I'm not rating based on baked goods.

The lunch specials guarantee you a full belly for just under $6.00. The ox-tail rice is one of my favorites! The lunch combo comes with soup of the day, complimentary bread and a drink. 

Service is what you'd expect at any Asian restaurant - quick and to the point. They don't make you feel like royalty, but they operate efficiently and that's fine by me for the price I'm paying."}
{"text":"I walked in for a quick snack after my physio appointment. It seemed decently busy for a Saturday morning. I looked at their selection which was the typical types of buns a bakery has like pineapple buns, sausage buns, raisin twist etc. I got the BBQ pork bun. The one bun came up to $1.20. This is the typical price for a bun. The BBQ pork really disappointed me. There were massive chunks of hard, dry pork in a very salty sauce within the bun. There was a lot of dough that surrounded the meat in the centre, so it took multiple bites to finally taste the pork. Very disappointing :( Try the BBQ pork buns at Lucullus Bakery!!"}
{"text":"Hong Kong Style Cafe - Great lunch specials and they are fast too.  

Not keen about dinner, since their menu changes to restaurant style menu and you can't order food from the the Hong Kong Style menu. 
I walked out of the restaurant  a few times because they stopped serving from the Hong Kong Style menu.  I was there at 8:45 PM, they said they stopped at 8:30 PM. Next time I was there at 8:20 PM, they said they stopped at 8 PM and so on.  
Now, I don't bother going to Billy Bakery & Cafe if it's after 7:30 PM."}
{"text":"Lunch menu under9 dollars! Including soup , bread and the entree. Awesome taste! Will come back!"}
{"text":"Billy's is a mish mash of a Chinese bakery and HK cafe that also does dinners. The place is fast and cheap. The quality is inconsistent. Sometimes it is really really good, others it is a bit off. Really depends I guess on whether the head chef is there or not. 

Anyways again, the reason you come her is because it's cheap and fast, and you never really have to wait for a table. Once in awhile, you'll get surprised with a really really good meal. Also I noticed that their dinner take out portions are smaller than the dine in.

3 stars, fluctuates between 2 and 4 stars depending on the day"}
{"text":"One of the most uncomfortable experiences I've ever had while dining. First off, the oldest female server fully leaned on me to hear the orders of my friend across the table. Please learn to have some respect for personal space! Then she moved us to a smaller table when she found out one person was not coming, which is fine except for the way she just told us to move. Not asked us. Told us. When my friend tried to add a soup and drink to his order, he was told that they don't do that on Saturdays. What? How can you not have soup and drink on Saturday, the busiest day? We could detect some subtle racism from the servers as well, who did not give us chopsticks. 

The food itself was middling to mediocre. Certainly a large portion. But by then I had completely lost my appetite and just wanted to leave."}
{"text":"I like this place for lunches with friends.  Price is very reasonable.  For $10, you can get a decent meal and a drink.   They have a bakery too, but they don't have a wide selection.

Food: okay.  The French toast (afternoon tea set) is a good deal and tastes really good!
Portion: enough for women, not for men.
Service: most of the waitresses look miserable, never smile.  I have been going to this restaurant every 2 weeks for the past 6 years.  The staff surely recognize me, but they are not particularly friendly.
Cleanliness: hmm, don't expect the bathroom to be clean.  The dining area is okay.
Bonus: free Wi-Fi"}
{"text":"The prices for the bao zi and chinese baked goods are really cheap. We got 10 buns of different kinds, and it only cost 5.20!"}
{"text":"This place is so so. A little rough around the edges, but the food isnt tooo bad. Unfortunately the weeknight we went, they didnt have a few of the dishes we wanted (ran out of morning glory and the crispy sticky rice chicken apparently has to be reserved and only available on weekends) 

The free soup that came with our meal smelled liked garbage... We had to ask them to take it away. The dishes we liked were the maggi sauce tenderloin and shrimp... Even tho it didn't taste like maggi style. The hand stripped chicken on green beans was just a strange combination, and typically the chicken shouldn't have bones init... But this one did. The sweet and sour pork and eggplant pot were both passable. 

All in all an ok place if youre absolutely desperate for something cheap and fast, but truthfully there are better choices around. 

Avoid the bathrooms."}
{"text":"We usually go for the set dinner and the selection is pretty good. The portions are reasonable and you get comp soup and dessert not bad but rice is side order.  Decore okay clean but some booths have tape on the benches which might be uncomfortable.  Overall it's a typical no frills type of Chinese/Cantonese joint."}
{"text":"Omgoodness, what happened.... I know this place wasn't ever like delicious but what made \"OK\" into \"blur.. eww \"

so disappointed....I know that I shouldn't have high expectations for a hk style cafe but give me edible foods where it taste like something please... 

Its time for me to bring down this so called 3*...which I have no idea where in the world they earned it in the first place.. 

First off, oatmeal and egg sandwich, oatmeal was too thick, tasteless and disgusting...it was cooked mainly with water and they probably gave 1 tbsp of milk for the colouring.... *boooooo*

family member ordered corned beef sandwich...and it was so little corned beef in it... felt like egg sandwich...

Yes the prices are cheap but since when did a cheap place with edible food become cheap place + cheap foods...???  Hello??? 

they are so lucky and smart with the location.... right across from RHCCC. Over 4000 people worshipping in a large church... (im one of them) for the sake of price and closeness is where the business mainly gets their business..... 

I'm sorry but ppl need to know this is not yummy food..."}
{"text":"Why did I get seated staring at the nasty fish tank? The lady owner of this long-standing restaurant has always had the same grumpy/angry face for the numerous years I've been here. I guess this is what Chinese restaurants are all about. Bad service but cheap good food. When I say good food, I really just mean their french toast. You get 3 large triangles of french toast that I am always craving for. However, I want peanut butter in them...."}
{"text":"I like it because the service is very good, most of the waitress are good attitude and manner. The food is on average that's why the price is very reasonable"}
{"text":"I love to go to this place for happy hours . The food is good and cheap . I loved their meat sauce spaghetti . It is very tasty and I love the meat sauce . 

Also, you can buy buns there"}
{"text":"This place is a very solid 3 out of 5 stars, but I am giving an extra star due to their incredible consistency.

Billy bakery has been a staple HK style cafe in Richmond Hill for nearly 20 years now. I remember when I was a young lad how this was a much smaller place that focused more on baked goods and served food on the side.

Over the years, they expanded to what they are today, and are more focused on serving food with baked items on the side (cha siu buns, pineapple buns etc).

I find some of the other reviews on Yelp for this place a little bit unfair. I actually read one review where they gave 2 stars, yet the person has checked in more then 6 times. I find it ridiculous that if you give a 2 star (which to me means you did not enjoy yourself), yet you STILL came back for a total of 6 times....well thats just a bit contradictory aint it?

This place is a very unpretentious place that does not pretend to be anything more then it is. A solid filling meal at a great price.

If your expecting 5 star dining experience where they come and check in on how your meal is going, refill your water/tea every time you take a sip or pull out the chair for you - Then please dont come here as you wont get that.

If your wanting something decadent or award winning that you want to post a picture of on Facebook or Instagram, then again this is not your place.

What you will get though, is a full stomach and a not so empty wallet when you leave.

On the weekends or when I have the chance to be at home on a weekday, I usually come here with my other half for lunch. They have a rotation of lunch specials that include a 

1) dinner roll (baked in house of course since they are a \"bakery\") with butter on the side
2) the daily soup (either chinese style or cream style) 
3) Main meal usually noodle soup, or a choice of pasta or rice
4) Drink (cold drinks such as cold milk tea will cost an extra $1.00)

You get all this for the price ranging from $7.99 to $9.99

I think the most expensive I have seen is $10.50.

If there is anywhere else that can give you all that within that price point please let me know, as I still have yet to find another place in the Richmond Hill/Markham corridor

So all in with tax and tip a meal for two here usually costs about $23. You do get what you pay for, and you are not paying for the service. But this place will give you a full stomach. 

I never found the food here overly salty, gimmicky, flavorless or anything extreme. If anything, if you come here and find you enjoyed your meal you will find the next time you come you will get the same thing. They are astonishingly extremely consistent in their prices, offerings, food and service.

Now the caveat though is that if I were to live further then 20 minutes from here I dont know if I would recommend coming all the way out. This place is not so fantastic that you have to drive far to try it. 

But if your a local of Richmond Hill, or are nearby and want a cheap, quick, filling meal and want to sit at a table and be served then this is your best place to go.

This place from morning to about mid afternoon is always filled with people. Older Chinese folk come and sit and buy a newspaper to read. I see a lot of home contractors coming and going at lunch and eating here, as well as families. On Sundays at lunch it can be insane here since there is a church across the street and everyone runs here.

You do get what you pay for, and if you happen to be in the area I definitely recommend you come check this place out for a solid meal. If your wanting something for your facebook/instagram then this is not the place."}
{"text":"I love this place for some quick and delicious Chinese HK style food. The service is ok but again, it's a Chinese fast food restaurant so, don't expect much in that area. The food itself is pretty consistent every time and it's cooked well. Been coming here for years now and still will visit in the future. FYI, it's quite busy during their peak hours."}
{"text":"We had cutlet pork with vermicelli n satay beef with macaroni for breakfast and comes with milk tea, good size with fair price. The only thing that need to complain was the milk tea not have enough \"tea\" taste"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food places I've ever tasted like closer to Chinese real Chinese food! Love this place!"}
{"text":"This place is not a cafe at all in fact they do not have any dessert in the menu . If you want to be treated like shit (excuse my language ) and feel like you are not welcome then go to this trashy store . Stupid owner was following us around to make sure we'd leave the trashy store . I'll be watching this business going down soon ."}
{"text":"I can get confused really easily. 

Billy Bakery & Cafe used to be Vienna Bakery & Cafe. They still keeps their Chinese name of Vienna. So am I in Billy or Vienna? 

All I know is there's almost 15 different kind of Noodle Soup to choose from and they all priced at $5.49 and includes a drink available from 11:30 am - 5:30 pm. 

Beef Brisket Rice Noodle Soup ($5.49) was A-OK. Perfect portion size for lunch or a snack.

I won't make a special trip to either it is called Billy or Vienna. A good and reliable neighbourhood Hong Kong Style Cafe is always a good thing."}
{"text":"Typical HK style cafe.  Lunch combos come with soup and drink.  Ordered their salted fish with tofu and diced chicken rice.  You can ask for less salt for your order."}
{"text":"Billy Bakery & Cafe is tucked in a plaza where Bruno's, Maxim and Yang's are located.  It is a Hong Kong style bakery plus Hong Kong style tea cafe.  It used to be called Vienna Bakery & Cafe.  In fact, the Chinese name remains as the Chinese translation of Vienna, but the English name has changed (see pictures).  Based on Vienna's reviews on Yelp, the name change may have happened in end of 2012 / beginning of 2013.

We ordered an eggplant and minced pork hot pot and a stir fried mushroom with beefs.  Both entrees came out momentarily; I meant they literally came out within 5 minutes of ordering, leading me to believe that they were pre-made.  They were hot and ready nevertheless.  The beef stir fry strangely became a hot pot (I double-confirmed with the menu later that it was supposed to be a stir fry).  It was very tasty.  The Chinese name of the eggplant and minced pork entree implied that fish sauce was one of the ingredients.  Both my dining mate and I could not taste any hint of fish sauce.  The dish was still tasty but it lacked that little bit of fish sauce taste.

The most striking impression of the entrees was that they tasted like \"really good\" food court food.  I mean they taste like the food from Yan's Cook food booth of First Markham Place, minus the excessive oil, except Yan's will use fish sauce in the eggplant hot pot.

I am giving it 2 stars because the stir fry has become a hot pot without any hint from the menu or the waitress, which was a disappointment.  Otherwise, it is a solid HK cafe that is worthy of 3 stars."}
{"text":"This restaurant is not bad but not great either. We had family dinner here for my niece's birthday. We ordered the set 8 dishes with peking duck for $128 and a few additional dishes. My niece really wanted peking duck for her birthday treat.
Service was very good for chinese restaurant. Our server was very quick with bringing our food, refilling our tea many many times, and changing the plates and emptying our the leftover.
It was a quaint little restaurant; we were given a quiet corner and the kids had their own table so that was nice 
Food was very average. However, I didn't like the seafood dishes here; the crab with ginger and onion was not fresh. Price was very reasonable
I would recommend getting non-seafood dishes only."}
