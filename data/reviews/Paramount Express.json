{"text":"This seems to be a satellite location to the \"mothership,\" the original restaurant/bakery located elsewhere in Mississisauga. Unfortunately, it fails to live up to the established reputation, missing the mark by a wide margin.  I showed up mid afternoon on a Sunday to an empty house. I ate in.  My Greek salad was drowned in a thick, bland dressing and made with chopped romaine that had been allowed to turn a very unappetizing brown at the edges. It also suffered from both a stingy hand with the feta and insufficient variety of other vegetables.  However, the chicken shwarma wrap was the bigger disappointment: dry, bland, skinny, carelessly assembled, unevenly sauced--a total disaster and one of the worst I've ever had, in stark contrast to the main location where it is notably excellent. This amounts to an unforgivable screwing up of a signature dish.  To their credit, the single employee on duty managed courteous, prompt service to slightly redeem the overall awful experience.  Perhaps I caught them on a bad day; however, I will not be returning soon to find out."}
{"text":"A friend and I visited this place for dinner on a Wednesday night.  The location is a paired down verison of the flagship restaurant on Dixie/Eglinton.  I ordered the Chicken Shawarma plate so did my friend.  The experience was not the same at the flagship restaurant, there was no fresh pita bread at our table.  The Chicken Shawarma was below average - the rice and chicken were dry.  The pita bread was hidden under all the chicken and tough to get to for my hummus.  I was expecting a similar level of quality of food like I would at their other locations but unfortunately, this location missed the mark.  I would skip this location, visit the flagship restaurant, you will have a better dining experience and quality of food."}
{"text":"I read the other reviews before starting mine. One review said that the one employee on duty that cooked and served for them was courteous. My experience was not the same. I went there for lunch one day and the kitchen was closed for some reason. I think it either had a renovation, bugs or new management. The restaurant was open, but the kitchen had buckets in it. They have one bad employee there and they should get rid of them if they haven't already. I went there over a year ago, and am writing a review because he was that bad. I didn't eat the food, but I'm glad I didn't pay money for such bad service. The other reviews I read say the food isn't worth it either.  Go here if you want a bad lunch experience"}
