{"text":"What's not to love?   Great beer and friendly service! And the beer sampler is well worth it..."}
{"text":"The pizza and fries and worth the trip alone. The service has always been very fast and friendly. The selection of beers is very impressive."}
{"text":"Not only is the food amazing, but the staff is as well. I recently brought my sister in who has serious food restrictions and eating out can be near impossible. Kitchen staff came out to sit and discuss what she WANTED and how to make that happen with her food restrictions.  They modified apps and completely created a entree to allow her to have something delicious, she wanted, and was safe for her. In the age of food allergies/sensitivities it was wonderful to be comfortable in fact that it was being taken seriously.  I truly can't say thank you enough!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best bars in Cleveland.  How can you go wrong with that many quality brews?  If you don't know what to get, simply ask one of the bartenders.  They are all very helpful and can definitely find your new favorite beer.    Just realize that most of the beers have pretty strong alcohol contents, higher than your average bud light, so keep that in mind when you are downing your third Kwak or Chimay Blue.    The food at the combined bar cento is fantastic as well.  Go during happy hour (430-7, all night on Monday).  You can get a fantastic burger for $5.  And the duck fat pomme frites are out of this world.  You know what I'm talking about if you've had 'em.    Cant wait for Market Garden Brewery to open across the street!  Same owners."}
{"text":"This happened a while back (though I wrote the review immediately afterward), maybe this fellow has received counselling or found the lord, but as of October of '08, he had some serious issues, please read on:   After a very pleasant evening enjoying draft Belgian-style microbrews and a friend's birthday party at the bier markt, I decided it was time to call it a night and cash out my tab at about 12:30 AM. Full disclosure is necessary: I had consumed 7 beers and dinner in the course of 4 1/2 hours, but as they we're about 10 oz glasses of one of their less-alcoholic selections, and I am a 200+ lbs man, I was not, at any point in the evening, drunk. I've gone back through the whole series of events, which I am attempting to relate as objectively as is possible, and all I can honestly find myself to be guilty of was one poorly-considered wisecrack, for which I immediately and repeatedly apologized.   Anyway, I waited at the far end of the bar for one of the bartenders to get to me, and I waited a while, which did not seem unusual, as it was a busy Saturday night. After a fair amount of waiting, I leant in against the edge of the end of the bar, apparently upsetting a tray of about 10 napkin-wrapped silverware packets that I hadn't seen resting there. The bartender who was nearest began to pick it up, and I said to him, \"Sorry about that. I guess if you guys had gotten to me about 10 minutes earlier, that never would have happened,\" using, I thought, an obviously joking tone. I'll admit, it was probably not a particularly funny joke to a bartender under the circumstances, though it was not at all confrontational in tone (and also a true statement), but his response: \"Why don't you go f*** yourself?\" seemed more than unnecessarily extreme...   \"What?!\" was all I could manage in my shock as a response, to which he replied, \"You won't get any more beers here.\" As I had previously stated, I was by no means intoxicated (in fact I am typing this first draft immediately afterward), but was being made to feel I was some kind of abusive drunk. After collecting myself somewhat, I said, \"I don't want any more beer, I'm just trying to cash out my tab.\" To which this gentleman glowered at me and replied, \"Well, you're going to be waiting a while,\" and walked over to one of the female bartenders, saying something I couldn't hear. I can only assume he was telling her not to wait on me. When I did get the attention of one of the other female bartenders (who had been providing fine service throughout the night), I asked for my check and asked what exactly was the problem of the other bartender, doing so purposefully well within his earshot. This was when he reiterated his earlier obscene suggestion as to where I could go and what I could do, and actually volunteered that he was one of the owners of the bar!   I was completely baffled at this point, how can this man expect to run his business in this fashion? At this point, I just wanted to get out of the place with my credit card and some shred of dignity (there were a number of folks that I'd just met at the party watching this whole exchange), so when the helpful bartender cashed out the tab and handed me the folder just as the abusive \"owner\" was again passing by, I took the opportunity to reiterate to him that I had upset the tray of silverware completely by accident and that I didn't think that his treatment of me as a customer was at all appropriate. His response to this statement (and I still have trouble believing this part, though I was standing there) was to slap the folder containing my check, credit card and receipt, then in my hand, upward into the air, scattering the contents onto the bar floor, and storm off like a three-year-old.   After I had located my card, receipt and folder on the floor, and asked for a new pen as I was unable to find the original, I paid my check, confirmed with the helpful female bartender that this man was indeed a co-owner of the bar (she was predictably disinterested in becoming involved in what it was becoming increasingly clear was probably a regular tantrum of her employer), and assured her that her tip was not reflective of his abuse. In fact, the two stars that the wait staff managed to salvage in this review, in spite of their owner picking a fight with this baffled patron, should speak highly of the level of service here.   Again, all I can find that I was guilty of was a bad joke, and at several points I gave this man the opportunity to apologize for his abusive language and behavior, at each opportunity he sought only to escalate the confrontation. In retrospect, I can only imagine that he really was trying to get me to take a swing at him, which, if you knew me, is beyond laughable.    Despite the fine selection of beer, impeccable service from everyone other than the ownership, and seemingly pleasant atmosphere, I have not and will never return to this bar, on the chance that I will be subjected to such abuse again."}
{"text":"One of the best places in Ohio City if you like Belgian beers!  The food from Bar Cento is pretty good as well, not quite my taste, but everything I have had has been very good."}
{"text":"I had to break up with Bier Markt, because our relationship was getting unhealthy--it loved my credit card just as much as I loved taking advantage of its happy hour, and I had to play the field for a while. However, I'm beginning to wax nostalgic for those huge red corner couches, the tall, tiny tables, and the menu. Oh, the menu. I love their burgers (one of my favorite burgers in Cleveland), pizzas, and I tried the mussels once and those were good. The pommes frites are amazing. Really, I've liked almost everything I've had there. The only thing I remember not loving were some mixed drinks at happy hour, which were just too mix-y (heavy on the syrup or soda or something). But the beer selection alone is worth it.  It generally has a pretty good crowd, both in the evenings during the week and on the weekends. It's populated by more of a young professional crowd, at least when I've been there. The bartenders/servers are always very attentive and friendly (but not annoyingly so), and the atmosphere in general is welcoming yet somewhat refined. I've been there for catered events and they've put out a really nice spread, and the space is perfect for accommodating several different gatherings at once without feeling overcrowded."}
{"text":"Cute place but the staff is so rude. First and last time ever going to that place, I hope their staff can get some etiquette classes or at the very least ask their parents why they weren't raised with any manners.   There's plenty of other places to go to on that street,  crossing this one off for good."}
{"text":"AHHHHHH! DAMN YOU BIER MARKT.  I love you, but then again, I hate you. I find myself here once-a-week chomping down on those delicious-ass fries cooked in some type of duck fat and sprinkled with rosemary, served in a nice German-esque paper cone. Also known as the famous Tableside Bavarian Pommes Frites! That's just the Bar Cento restaurant side of it. There's also the bar on the other side and the Speakeasy downstairs! WHAT, SPEAKEASY? Yes.  Although I love this place because it serves delicious food until late night (get the pizza, duck confit if it's avail or the sunnyside!) - the social scene can do a little work. The crowd is beautiful but they aren't social animals. What I mean is....it's a little difficult for my friendly chipper self to strike up a conversation and make friends at the end of the night. This is very important to me, as an out-of-towner from LA.   The beer selection is obviously one of the best in town. Lindemann's Framboise?! Forget the tall girly glass it comes in, just pour it in my MOUTH!  The speakeasy -  not the best that I've seen (it's obviously accessible) and there's always a dead crowd. It's a nice attempt though, for Cleveland's standards. The bartenders are cute but they aren't that friendly. This is a problem if the crowd is dead and you're sick of talking to your friend.   The entire establishment is beautiful and I love the clear incandescent light bulb fixtures hanging from the ceiling.   Overall, come to Bier Markt if you have amazing drunken munchies and a group of awesome friends to chill with. If you really need to talk to random strangers, bum a cigarette outside and let the night take you away :)"}
{"text":"Most eclectic beer selection you're gonna find from Chicago to NYC!"}
{"text":"Bier Markt offers an excellent atmosphere with good music, lighting and aesthetic setup. The beer offered on tap is great and the beer selection is just as good. I live in Lakewood and this place is one of my favorite places to stop and grab a drink at."}
{"text":"We were driving around downtown Cleveland looking for a sports bar to watch the baseball game. We were told to go to \"The Flats\". As we were searching for \"The Flats\" we ran upon this place and decided to give it a try.   The beer menu gives the alcohol content, which my friend loved. The staff was extremely friendly. There was a college football game on and I wanted to watch to White Sox beat upon the Indians. They were generous enough to change the channel.   We snacked on the mussels and drank a few bottles of various beers. I liked this place and can see it as a regular hangout, if I lived in Cleveland, Ohio."}
{"text":"The Food:  OMG, the Pommes Frites gave me a food orgasm!  They are loaded with rosemary and garlic and are served with 4 types of mayo.  My only complaint was that I wanted more.  The pancetta and fried egg pizza was worth going, as well.  They share a menu with Bar Cento.    The Drinks:  Extensive beer list, but I don't drink or like beer.  The wine list was adequate; I recently had a nice Spanish Granache that I have since purchased by bottle for home.    The Ambiance:  Bier Markt shares a space with Bar Cento, with only one wall separating.  I was there on a Friday night recently, and it was nice to have another bar to get my wine since the Bier Markt's bar was very busy.  Crowd was primarily a 30s and 40s after-work crowd, but did not mingle much.  Maybe I'm asking too much, Cleveland.  Prices were reasonable.  I can't remember how much I paid but I don't remember it setting me back very far.    Parking is a little tough, as is with all of the market district spots.  I always park down from the Flying Fig on 26th in the lot where they will keep an eye on your car.  I would definitely return to Bier Markt or Bar Cento."}
{"text":"I've come in here a couple times for food and a couple more times for just beer! Their beer selection is truly amazing and delicious and filled with all the good things made in this earth. The bartenders are knowledgeable and helpful with choosing either a brewed drink or a cocktail or whatever libation you fancy imbibing.  I had the happy hour burger which was decent and a good deal. They have lots of other food items on their happy hour, so I would highly recommend coming in and trying everything you can during that time! I've heard they also have a pretty fun and bumpin dance floor in the basement maybe it's on the weekends, but I'm looking forward to checking that out soon. Bar Cento shares a kitchen with them next door, so they serve I believe the same foods. The pea pasta was amazing and super fresh and summery and bright, I think about that pasta every time I drive by that 2 mile radius. Last time I went they were out of mussels, but I swear to thee that I will have those mussels soon or my name isn't George Washington! Okay, my name isn't George Washington, but I really want those mussels. And I shall have them too."}
{"text":"I came out with 2 friends for a drink. Walked in. Not too busy but steady. Walked up to the bar and ordered a drink. The bartender completely ignored the other two people I as with. I ordered a beer they didn't have, I then ordered another and he gave me a dirty look. Still ignoring my friend. I guess multi tasking is foreign to him. Flannel shirt and black glasses. Such a d-bag. So I then order for my friends and he can't be bothered. I them ordered from another bartender who was extremely professional.   I then let the other bartender know that we were taken care of. He proceeded to swear at me and tell me he would have me thrown out. I own 3 restaurants and have never been rude. This guy should be fired. I will not go back. Would rather go to Town Hall. Better service."}
{"text":"I really dug this place. The service was okay but I wish the bar was bigger in order to accommodate more people. The marguerite pizza was delicious and I had a cranberry juice which was good. The music is also a bit too loud for my taste but overall this place has a good vibe."}
{"text":"Love this place!! They always have great Belgian beers on tap! Have done many tastings here. Went here yesterday for Sunday funday :) Eddie was our bartender and he was awesome! He had to kick a couple of drunk rude people out, but I thought he handled it well. Their fries are the best thing I've ever eaten in my life! Get extra garlic mayo because you'll want more! I get the fries every time I go regardless if I'm hungry or not! Also I just found out they are dog friendly, so this is going to be one of my go to spots even though I live in Westlake. You won't be disappointed, go here!"}
{"text":"Bier Markt has really good food, a great beer selection, and generally good service.  However, on Friday and Saturday nights it is generally jam-packed, loud as hell, and annoying.    I have been downstairs to Speakeasy which was still extremely loud, though slightly less crowded.  My best experiences here have been on weeknights and when sitting at a table."}
{"text":"This place is an absolute joke. The management has HORRIBLE conflict resolution skills and is extremely lazy when trying to deal with possible issues in the bar. I cannot see this place succeeding with the current owners and management and the sooner this place is closed the better off Ohio City will be as a neighborhood. I truly despise this place and will encourage all of my friends to never step foot in this atrocious establishment."}
{"text":"Our bartender, Brandon, was attentive, skilled, and personable even with the crowded bar. The bass is a little heavy, making it hard to hear the music, but the ambiance was good. The crowd is what you expect in Ohio City... hipsters and middle aged folks trying to be hipsters. It makes for good people watching! I didn't get a chance to dig into their dinner menu, having already dined elsewhere, but I feel that I missed out because it all sounded delicious! I will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Very hard to believe this place is in cleveland! Amazing beer selection, good and very knowledgeable and helpful bar staff, good food, and very reasonable pricing. Possibly the best selection of belgian beer I have seen."}
{"text":"Love the Bier Markt!  Main level is usually pretty busy and loud on weekend nights, but always worth a stop if you're doing a night out on W 25th.  Great beer selection too..  I personally MUCH prefer the downstairs bar.  In my honest opinion, it is one of the best bar rooms in Cleveland.  Relaxed atmosphere, cool lighting, & a great bar setup.  I've had some great nights there."}
{"text":"This had been one of my favorites in Ohio City for years...chill atmosphere, reliable service, great food. Recommend going for happy hour, best discounts in the city for quality food! 5-7 pm weekdays and I believe all day Monday"}
{"text":"I ordered a salad and its size is of a side dish. salads are just terrible. If you do not want to leave hungry, you will need to order something else. My son ordered a burger and it seemed reasonable, but nothing spectacular. But if you are looking for different types of bier, this is definitely the place! Craft bier from many parts of the world. Service was marginal. This is a place that I do not plan to go back, because it is just OK to marginally below average. But again Good bier selection."}
{"text":"I used to live in Ohio City.  Now that I don't, they have the most amazing places to go. Enter the Bier Markt. With a name like a market of beer, you would expect five kabilzillion different types of beer. you would be correct- but OUTSTANDING choices.  hoegaarden, piraat (the pirate beer...ARRRRRRR), literally - probably about 40 beers on tap.  and damn good ones.  every beer of your hops full fantasies. the clientle was a bit mixed...with the yuppies that are invading Ohio City mixed with the artsy folks..and also some extremely drunk ass girls at the bar (one of which made me her new best friend, which was pretty funny. ah, crazy drunk people.  good times). anyways, the place is huge.  and don't be like the dude who was to my right.  with all the worldly yummytastic beers on tap, the dude ordered a coors light bottle. really, my friend?  a coors light?  you disappoint me, john q. fraternity.  i will be back.  to endulge in more of my hops full fantasies.  minus john q fraternity and maybe plus one john q. indie boy.  good beer.  go. go now.  addendum:  monday nights:  happy hour ALL NIGHT LONG.  seriously. fancy pants beers for three bucks??? i died and went to heaven.  beer heaven.  hoegaarden heaven."}
{"text":"Love Bier Market and Bar Cento! Do these places have the same menu?! Either way, I love the trendy feel of this bar/restaurant. The quality of the food is always on point and the service is just as great. Great place for happy hour and dinner! Love their wine too....maybe a little too much because happy hour turns into 3 hours haha. Although I can't attest to this, my friends ordered the Pomme Frites the other day and were totally gushing over how delicious they were! Definitely one of my fave spots"}
{"text":"I just love this place. I love the large beer selection, I love the happy hour and I love the food. This is one of my favorite places still to this day in Ohio City.  I recently came here with my boyfriend during beer week and we were lucky enough to get a table for 2 without a wait (wahoo)! Our server was so speedy that we had to keep asking her for more time (a good thing) even though we knew we were for sure ordering the Sunnyside Pizza. We both ended up ordering Ballast Point beers and my boyfriend also ordered a pizza to go (the mushroom). I still have never ordered an entree from here because the pizza is so good!!"}
{"text":"I have fallen absolutely in love with this place!   The happy hour is fantastic! With cheap and, might I add, absolutely DELICIOUS food, this bar was already on a roll. I brought my mom here after a much sought after visit to Cleveland a couple of weeks ago. She doesn't visit often and I've learned from a few disappointments that I need to look for specific qualities in an establishment that I bring her to.   1. Prices. The prices have to be reasonable and justified. If something is a little over a desired price range, then it must be WORTH IT in quality, quantity and overall satisfaction. Bier Markt definitely won with this during happy hour (4:30pm-7pm daily), since everything was significantly reduced in price and we had some of the best and unique bar food I've had.  2. Beer. Beer selection MUST include Budweiser. Simple. Once again, Bier Markt pulled ahead of some competition with the \"King of Beers.\"   Now, to the details. Our server(s) (we had many people take our orders, bring out beer, bring our food, check on us, etc.) were great and on their game, though I think the poor boy they had bringing food out of the kitchen was given no direction at all and just wandered until someone hungry tried to claim the food.   The beer was tasty and served quickly and because we were there during happy hour, it was cheap! The burger was cooked to absolute perfection. We split it and both of us like our meat to be fairly pink in the middle; it definitely was. Juicy, covered in caramelized onions and perfectly cooked, this burger awed us. The fries were roasted with garlic and rosemary and were definitely a unique take on french fries. We liked them, though didn't have much room for them in the end. The mozzarella/garlic pizza was good, though the most disappointing part of our meal. The flatbread was crispy and the mozz was good, the garlic was abundant, but the pizza was plain overall.   On to the STAR: the mussels! My mom and I love us some shellfish and we devoured these mussels. I'm no mussel expert, but I was tempted to say they were \"the best\", while my mom confirmed and said they were the best she's ever had.   Do come here if only just to have some mussels and a beer!"}
{"text":"I can't contribute much more than the other reviews found here. Actually, I am learning to just agree with fellow yelpers rather than try to stand only on my own regards. But I would not be following my heart if I did not write here, on the internet, that I LOVE Bier Market.   Tons of beer... tons of really good beer. The thought that someone would pay for a Pabst across the street when they could indulge in some weirdo micro brew here just seriously blows my mind. I used to live in Tremont and I would drive by this joint after grocery shopping (err, at Dave's which is a story unto itself) and always be bummed that I didn't have a 'real' job; one that would afford me the luxury of post-work drinks on the street side patio of Bier Market.   I did enjoy many a night here. Some memories are sweet (making out) and others are hilarious (homeless people a plenty). The best experience was after the Cavs won the Eastern Conference championship, when west twenty-fifth street was literally littered with the best sports fans ever: black out drunk ones. I have never had a better seat as a spectator without the sport."}
{"text":"Beer is fantastic, staff is friendly, and the food continues to be flavorful, creative, and tasty. Should be a destination for anyone coming to Cleveland."}
{"text":"Good selection of Belgian beer. Quaint comfy atmosphere. If your looking for a fancier beer such as chimey or chouffee on draft this is the place for you! I surly was not disappointed."}
{"text":"Good beer, slightly pretentious in my opinion but otherwise a good place to go (other than the ridiculously high seats that aren't quite right).   If you want a domestic, don't come here. Beware of the \"look at me\" crowd."}
{"text":"Don't go here.  I like it too much, and I don't want it to get crowded.  If you do go, order a Kwak, and drink it.  You will not have regrets."}
{"text":"Run, don't walk, to Bier Markt and get their newest pizza...the Pork Nduja pizza.  Pork sausage, caramelized onion, mozzarella, provolone, and green tomato salsa verde.  A little kick and downright yummy.  But hurry..it will not be on the menu very long."}
{"text":"Great bar tenders wonderful beer selection Duck fat fries were great  When I was there Yeungling (Anheuser-Busch InBev) was having a launch party. Which is hysterical, people were psyched for yeunling while there were literally dozens of better beers available."}
{"text":"I liked McNutly's. We went in here for a couple beers on a lazy Saturday afternoon and it was as good of a experience as you could expect. They have a great beer selection and you'd be hard pressed to not find something for everyone. The inside it a little on the dark and dank side with hardly any natural light but that is really a trait I tend to like in my watering holes....We didn't get a chance to try and of the food but from what everyone around us was ordering it all looked delicious. Especially the pomme frittes which were heaping piles of fries basically. The only downside to this place is that it seemed to be understaffed and the guys who were there were hauling ass to fill all the orders. Hope I get a chance to check it out again next time I'm in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Met the Chef who explained that it's fresh produce comes from the Refuge Response Garden in Ohio City!  Savored the Bianco Pizza!  One of the best I ever had. Thin & Crispy hand tossed dough!  Just like my Nanu made! Salad made with greens from the refuge garden, fresh picked that day!  Also tried the Pepperoni Pizza and the Chef told us that the Pepperoni is made in house!  Tasted the Spicy Chicken made with jalapeños!  It was HOT and zesty!  The Vegan pizza was made with artichoke, aruga & sun dried tomatoes in a Marinara Sauce.  Great service,  busy but quiet!  Loved the decor!  Has a multitude of International Beers to chose from.  A great place for a change of pace!  Monday Special is $5 for a Bianco Pizza  & $5 for a large Long Island Ice Tea!"}
{"text":"Every time I have been here the food has been fantastic the flatbread pizzas are amazing and the pome frites are to die for. The craft beer selection is very good and they seem to always have something new and interesting or a good one off to give a shot. The atmosphere is pretty cool and trendy. When I was here last night it was really busy my wife and I sat at the bar to have dinner and a few drinks. The service was overall subpar for us and most of the bartenders were rather unfriendly. It seemed like they were giving lots of attention to people who didn't have seats and were ordering over bar guests backs. Because of the busy night i understand slower service at the bar just be friendly to those who are patient. Bartender Aaron did a nice job and looked like he was carrying the weight for the others...dinner was an outstanding ribeye and risotto because they were out of the Brussels sprouts... My side came out prolly 10 minutes after I got my steak and was barely warm which kinda sucked...  I have been here multiple times and have had better service overall than this night although this night wasn't a 4 out of 5 bier markt definitely is."}
{"text":"This place had a wonderful and wide beer list that was fit with the holiday season. There were so many Christmas beers and ales that I was able to get an exclusively holiday beer flight. The beers were delicious. The service was very kind and innovative when it came to making sure my party could get what they wanted. The side orders we got were so great and tasty, but I was disappointed by the Bianco flatbread and Caesar salad. Overall, it was a decent experience."}
{"text":"Great ambiance. Bartender Colen -great conversation and knowledge of their beer selection.  Took our daughter and her special guy who are great beer experts and they really had a great time too"}
{"text":"Sunday lunch Mussels were soggy, lamb meat balls were great service was great, sandwich was ok. Hope I don't get sick on those mussels. I will not return."}
{"text":"Fun place but staff is rude and has major egos!! My husband asked for more ice in his glass and the waitress rolled her eyes, came back and shoved eight straws in his glass! When we asked one of the staff members where the bathrooms were, he responded with an arrogant attitude. The staff is horrible and I will never return because of them! I understand that working at a bar can be stressful due to people drinking and having fun... But that is the point of a bar right? To drink and have fun? Townhalls way better!!"}
{"text":"holy déjà vu.  I went to this venue *years* ago when it was Mediterranean themed, with the same awkward table in the entrance.  I must say: 1948 West 25th Street has aged well.   This large, two-story bar has managed to avoid half-abandoned venue territory... while also avoiding the opposite evil: sweaty, crowded meat market.  Instead, it was a nice mixed crowd enjoying beer, cocktails, indie music, sports, and conversation. Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this gem when we had nearly an hour wait at Great Lakes. Since GL has limited space to wait we decided to walk around the corner. After 10 minutes here we proceeded to call and have them cross out name off at GL.   This place has a wonderful, relaxed atmosphere where the people here are of all kinds. Couples, professionals, young, old. Everyone fits in which is the great thing about this place.   We sat at the bar on our first visit and decided to do a taster since we hadn't been before. There was a great selection and I like to try the Stout of the Week which has always been good. They also have IPAs that I love to try but I usually skip the belgians.   Great staff and we never have had a problem with service. We've been when it's been packed and also when we've been the only 2 in the bar.   The Big Board is my favorite thing to go with my beer but I've also had good pizza and fries here.  Overall, I'll def. be back. Love the beer and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"This place is for goofballs, sluts, and weirdos.  The owner must be a maximum egomaniac to open all these bars and ruin an otherwise respectable enough neighborhood. Manager is some kind of mutant Ken doll. I did not order food because my waitress looked like my imagination of an ashley madison reject. I would like to grab a sock of nickles and smash everyone's plate on a Jesus tyrade because today is first day of Lent. place is gross. What was I thinking when I visited here? There is no European bar atmosphere. they have de koninck which happens to be one of my favorite beers. One star extra for that.  'I will show you fear in a handful of dust' vibes even when I walk by this place on my way to the rapid. Gross."}
{"text":"Good food, affordable prices, good atmosphere, and good service.  Potato rosemary garlic fries are a must. The fries are thick cut (not flat), crispy, and not mushy or soggy despite their thickness. It is a huge portion, so share it with friends! I've also had two pizzas here, and I love the thin flaky crust. Burgers are also a safe bet here.   Can get pretty crowded, but overall laid back, young, fun atmosphere.   Go for happy hour - its cheap good eats!"}
{"text":"Where else can you go to get this full of a selection of Belgian beer on tap?  Not sure if food is available but love this place from the beginning."}
{"text":"I like bier markt! They have a great selection of draft beers. I had a Kwak amber ale last weekend. Delicious.   I like the atmosphere and the decor. I'm not as interested in the crowd that's there; I generally go with a group of friends. We pair our bier markt experience with Bar Cento, which is fairly good pizza. Good combo.  I found the service to be a little snarky. They do know their beers though."}
{"text":"this place is awesome.   if i lived in this area, i'd be here all the freakin time.    my friend richie and I had some time to kill before our flight back home so we just started driving around randomly.  We drove by countless bars and then i saw this place and HAD to stop.  If you know me, you know I LOVE belgian beers, especially the darker stuff.    So yeah we walked in, sat down and looked at the tap menu.  They have a big ol' board with a ton of different kinds of belgian beers all on tap.  it was amazing.    I ordered a St. Bernardus Abt 12.  It was soooo good.  ughhh i want more.  ............................hmm  yeah i got nothin else.    it was good.  if you're in the area, check it out.  bye   ohhh yeah!  2 beers cost us 11.25.  DAMN! awesome deal for this quality of beer."}
{"text":"Really love this place. The fries are as good as it gets. (It's all about the duck fat.) The pizzas are bar pies, but they are as good as that style of pizza gets. I'm normally a red sauce, keep-it-simple guy, but every \"modern\" pizza I've had off the menu has been tasty. (Try the pork sugo pie.) Great house-cured charcuterie, as well. (This is the kind of place you want to post up to the bar and share as many small plates as you can stomach.) I love the happy hour for those of us who can't make the usual happy hour... drink specials all day Sunday, and food and drinks all day Monday. You get a huge, shareable plate of fries for $4, and beers with actual flavor for $3.50 a glass!"}
{"text":"fries were delicious! lots of beers on tap and i enjoyed the ones i ordered. knowledgeable bartenders. will be back to try the food"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times now. The service is very good. The food is just pretty good in my opinion, a little overpriced or hyped."}
{"text":"This place is a gem and this is coming from someone who doesn't drink beer, save for the occasional Three Philosophers from time to time.  For me, a great bar is about more than what's served behind the counter.  Its a combination of location, ambiance and how little I have to raise my voice to hear the person sitting three inches away from me.  Thank you, Bier Market, for helping me have an enjoyable and pleasant night, all while sipping some pretty decent malbec."}
{"text":"I really enjoy beer. I found Bier Markt and basically died of awe only to rise up amidst taps and bottles aplenty. Okay, poetry aside this place is as good as it gets for beer selection in the near-Cleveland area.   The crowds on weekends are active and fun. Mingling happens at the bar as there is plenty of room for groups to grab tables and floor space. Also a pool table in the rear. Bartenders are fun and know their beers. Also generally attractive for both M and W.   The patio out-front is the go-to for smokers. Its also a wonderful spot to sit with a bite and beer in the summertime.   Good stuff. I'll keep stopping by Bier Markt for the drinks as well as the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why I haven't yet reviewed one of the best beer snobby drinking establishments in Clevetown.   Bier Markt is everything a snooty, pretentious, craft beer drinker could ask for. Kwak, Duvel, Piraat, oh my! Each time I visit, I die and go to Belgian beer heaven.   If you're not a beer drinker, (why are you breathing?) they offer wine and various cocktails. Believe it or not, I ordered a mulled wine and it was delicious. Everyone kept asking why I was drinking out of a mug and if I was sick or something.   The atmosphere is really lovely as well. I love the huge, comfy tables that are surrounded by curtains.   Bar Cento is next door, Speakeasy is downstairs. There are plenty of options in one convenient space.   The only negative things about this place: it gets really crowded on weekends these days and it can be tough to move around. And there's a jerk of a bartender that works downstairs at Speakeasy."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the beer choices and how they serve in appropriate beer glasses. It enhances the experience! Good pricing as well! Good job guys!"}
{"text":"Good good, but you literally have to beg the waiters to serve you. And after you finally get a waiter you have put up with the horrible attitude of them... Specially the blond girl at the front desk... Good food, bad experience."}
{"text":"At 1AM on a weekend, if I'm in Ohio City you will likely find me here, with a cold beer nomming on something tasty from the kitchen. Pizza, pomme frites, steamed mussels, etc. All delicious and incredibly satisfying late night when you've maybe had too many. Gets a bit crowded on weekend nights, Fridays especially, so if you aren't down for the early to late 20's crowd you may want to avoid those times, but regardless of when you come there will be plenty of interesting people, beer, and food to choose from."}
{"text":"We went to Bier Market for a birthday party in the basement. It was my first time there and I was impressed. Drink selection is excellent, service was fantastic. They have the highest rated pizza in Ohio according to Zagat. I wouldn't say it was the best I've ever had, but it was pretty good. The crowd was young and hip, I would totally recommend checking it out. You could even play how many hipsters can you spot. Skinny jeans? Check. Flannel shirts? Check. Think rimmed glasses? Check. Hope they have a lot of PBR stocked."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner recently with a group. My first impressions of this place are very positive; the restaurant keeps up a trendy atmosphere and appearance, and the menu, although a bit small, was very appealing. I only had the belgian beer and butter sauce mussels, which I thought were quite tasty. I definitely look forward to coming back to try more food and the selection of beers, and I was happy to see they had imported varieties of cider, one of my go-to drinks that's difficult to come by in variety at a lot of restaurants."}
{"text":"Smallest salad portion ever! The burgers are good as is the beer selection, but seriously... The salad came with 3 leaves. Rip off."}
{"text":"ok i'm really torn about giving this rating, so i have to go back again and do a follow up.  i meet my friends here around 7pm on july 4. it was one of few places open at that time, so points for that! i arrived late so my friends had been there for a while and actually all got their orders already. they reported to me that 2 out of 3 of them got the wrong beer and one of them had their food order messed up and the waitress had to come up a couple times to confirm orders. i'm feeling a little weary already.  one of my friends asks for a refill of water, and the waitress takes his glass. 5 minutes later, another waiter comes up and brings me a glass of water. i think this is for me since i just sat down, but my friend who asked for a refill tells me he saw that this was his cup they took back. as evidence, he shows me the bent straw that he had been chewing on that is still in the cup.  ew.  everyone else is pretty much half done with their meal, so i want to put in my order quickly. however, i don't see any staff around, and it's a good 10 minutes before someone comes and asks if i want a drink. i'm not offered a food menu so i have to ask for it, then it's another 15 minutes before someone comes back to take my order. by now, everyone has finished their meal, so i decide i'll just order to go and eat it later while we're watching fireworks. we ask for the check so we can get that squared away so we don't have to wait longer, but the food still takes another 25 minutes. thankfully we paid all in cash or else i don't want to imagine how terribly wrong the bill would have been split if we had asked them to do that. although one of my friends suggested we just round up to the next dollar, we still did tip appropriately and more than they deserved for sure.  so that's the service. i got the veggie burger which i didn't get to eat til later. when i bit into tho i was kind of amazed at how good it was, even at lukewarm an hour later. it was kind of crispy and super tasty. the fries were pretty good as well. oh and the leffe blonde i had while sitting at the restaurant waiting for service was pretty good.  overall i'd give it 1 for service and 4 for food, but maybe the good wait staff were all off bc it was july 4. i will try it again another day."}
{"text":"Extensive beer selection, focused on Belgians. Great, cheap happy hour menu (the $6 burger is a steal). Five- or 10-beer flights are a great way to sample many varieties in one sitting. Service is prompt, unobtrusive and unpretentious. There is a welcome lack of rabid sports fans and ultra-hipsters. Just laid back people enjoying great beer. One of my favorites in CLE."}
{"text":"For a German (Bier) beer place you can only imagine my surprise that the house lager is...wait for it... Coors.  No, Coors is not a lager and I even question that it's beer.    The inside looked fun and hip, but service was poor and slow.  I'm kind of holding a grudge over the whole Coors thing..."}
{"text":"Everytime I go here I get one thing...PEARL STREET! It is the best bear in Cleveland, at least for me. The other beer selection is also very good as well. I really like the atmosphere here too.  Over all never had a bad time here, except the womens bathroom can take forever to get into."}
{"text":"I love this place. I love this place because:  They have a beer sampler, which I did not have to make a decision on, I told the bartender that I enjoy stella and blue moon, he came back with an ample tasting of 5 beers all of which I liked. He even wrote down which ones he gave me, it was great.   The thin crust pizza was heavenly.  They serve food until 2 everyday! Which is a great big plus, espcially in Ohio City.   The bartender even made fun of my friends for ordering martinis and gave them a sample of beer that were garunteed to enjoy. Ahh the power of Lambic.   The place is huge, and we all fit in a large booth, which was great, because we usually make some sort of scene taking up more space than neccessary.   Go here. It is worth it. The prices are too."}
{"text":"This place would be way better if the dj played a song for more than 30 seconds, Jesus Christ. When I hear nelly, ride with me. I want to hear the whole god damn mother fucking song. Not 30 seconds. How retarded could you be"}
{"text":"We came in late but Elliot was extremely welcoming and took care of our every need.  The Big Board was killer and the pickles were especially great!  Elliot even went as far as to chill our beers when we took a little long to drink them.  He was very knowledgeable and accommodating!    I'll come back soon!"}
{"text":"Bier Markt is a solid choice for a happy hour and it's usually not too busy so getting a table for a group without a reservation has been doable on the occasions that I've gone.  Happy hour menu is a good deal.  There is usually a  decent selection of drafts and the food is okay for the price.  Overall you get what you pay for so the burger, pizza, etc. isn't anything to rave about, but it's not bad.  I tried the pizza on the happy hour menu, which I would probably skip next time around.  Its hard to complain too much since it was only $5. I found it especially greasy and the crust was nothing special.  I do like their fries though.   Service has also been overall good.  They are able to accommodate larger parties and don't seem to have any trouble splitting the checks at the end. Waiters are fairly attentive and they are prompt about getting drinks to the table."}
{"text":"I got into craft beer about 5 years ago in college. I like brown and IPAs the most. Bier Market has the best selection of Belgium beers around. I love the St. Bernardus and the Brooklyn IPA. The happy hour is one of the best in Cleveland and the décor is very fitting for the type of bar. The food is quite good but I have yet to try those outside of the happy hour list."}
{"text":"One word: fries.    Their fries are actually incredible. It may be because I am a sucker for anything with fresh rosemary, but I could not stop eating these delicious golden morsels. That and all of the different dips and sauces you get with them are bomb. They have eveything from a spicy red pepper aioli to good ol' reliable ketchup. Definitely give them a try if you find yourself at Bier Markt!  Tip: They are also great for sharing and meeting new people!"}
{"text":"Cool spot bought some cool beer glasses there. Waistaff very friendly!"}
{"text":"The decor in here was welcoming. Although at the bar the lights were dimmed with a cheap red cloth hanging over them, not aesthetically pleasing. I had the Founders Centennial IPA, about $6. Dark Belgian beer is the name of the game here. Bar service was rather slow, they did have good happy hour specials though, selling import drafts for $3.50. Definitely want to come back to try the food."}
{"text":"Horrible service and the food was bland. We ordered all of the pasta plates, and nothing was good. The best thing that we had were the French fries because it's hard to incorrectly make French fries. The spaghetti with lamb meat ball was bland and had no taste. They could've just used spaghetti sauce from a can and it would've tasted sooooo much better. Great variety of drinks, but the service to get a drink took forever."}
{"text":"Cool bar with lots a different Belgian beers on tap and a few special ones in bottles.  There are two sections the front which is more restaurantlike and the back bar area.  We were in the back trying some beers.  Even though I live in Europe, they had some beers that I have never seen before."}
{"text":"Two stars, your asking?  How can that be?  Here's how.  My wife and I stopped in for a few beers and lunch.  The lunch was excellent.  The service was good, the food was tasty, and the staff was attentive.    The beer, amazingly, was the issue.  Between the two of us, we had 5 beers.  Of those 5, 3 were the wrong beer.  I started with the Gose, and then asked for a Petrus Red.  What I got was straw colored.  It was a sour, and a great beer, but not what I ordered.  I liked it so much, I ordered another.  She brought me a Gose.  My wife ordered the Fore smoked stout, but received a Stone Xocoveza.  It's also a great beer, and one of her favorites, but not what she ordered.    A different bar tender stopped to chat, and I mentioned to him that we didn't get the beers we ordered.  He let us know that both the Fore and the Petrus were not on tap, and that we had old menus.  The bartendress gave us some lame excuse about \"pouring based on numbers\".  We left feeling kind of annoyed - to go into a place named after beer, and have a server that either didn't know the difference between a Flanders red and a Danish blond (Mikkeller Spontan Peach), or figured we wouldn't know the difference is annoying.    I've had this happen once at Town Hall, but never at Nano, Market Garden, Tremont Tap, La Cav du Vin, or Melt."}
{"text":"Frequent this place fairly often. The food is always great, the service is always great. My only complaint is the DJ. My group of friends likes to go out dancing and every single time we go to the basement here the DJ plays 20 second clips of songs and switches to the next. The entire crowed will be digging a song then 20 seconds later new song. Maybe people like this considering it's like that every time? I will be back for the food but if you don't enjoy a DJ who plays 20 second clips of songs then I would go dancing elsewhere. If you do like 20 second clips of songs then this place will not disappoint."}
{"text":"\"we really need a table inside, Mike. no more of this sitting outside sh#t\" \"don't worry, I'll sweet-talk the girl at the door...hey honey, I need a table for seven. you can get that for us inside? thanks, sweetheart.\"  the benefits of working in the 1950s is that I have absolutely no grasp of what it means to be PC.   the final stop on our Cleveland Crunk Crusade happened to be this place. it's listed as Bar Cento and Bier Markt at the same address, but it seems Bar Cento is the more upscale bar/restaurant area, while Bier Markt is the bar area which happens to have food too. sounds confusing, especially when you've been drinking for several hours and the waitress hands your table BOTH menus...but yeah.  excellent list of import beers here. I made a beeline for the Delirium Tremens Nocturnum, as that stuff is ridiculously delish. that was my only beer here, as I had had a fair amount to drink already at the three previous bars, and needed to prepare my liver for Jen's birthday party on Saturday. they also had a wine sampler which my cousin Anna tried.  one of my cousins ordered a cheese and fig plate...okay, kinda random, but he enjoyed it. another one ordered pommes frites, which - and this sounds hard to believe - were about on par with the infamous Pommes Frites here in New York. damn son!  atmosphere was a bit of a cross between a lounge and a nice sports bar, if that makes any sense.  highlight of the night: a somewhat drunk Mike B teaching Italian to some random shmucks. I started out teaching them how to compliment their girls, but they didn't seem to like that. this is why I have cousins who are bigger than me. frisk 'em, Big G!  you can't take me anywhere."}
{"text":"Great pizza - especially after having some unique beer- sours, ciders, IPA's. The service was very good and bar intriguing. One side is wine and cocktails in a sophisticated environment and the other side beer and wine in a more relaxed atmosphere. Menu is the same on both sides. Good experience!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite spot ever to go if we're headed out for an evening of adult beverages and fun. It's NOT on W.6th, it's got plenty of tremendous beers (and wines) to choose from, and you can eat there late! There's really nothing better than that!  Bier Markt draws in all sorts of people during the week and even on the weekends. You never know who'll be posted up at the bar, or chilling on the patio. Beer snobs, artsy folk, young professionals, etc. There is a little of everyone here and that's why I love it.   Depending on what mood you're in, you can even chill out a little more on the Bar Cento side. If you're feeling a little more swanky, you can head down to the Speakeasy on the weekends for a more old fashioned cocktail. Whatever you're feeling, there's a vibe for you here.   I can't say enough about the food too. I always get one of the pizzas and a side salad. The pizzas are super thin crust with a little of their perfect sauce and their cooked in the big stone oven. You can even watch the kitchen hard at work preparing these delectable pies. I seriously can't get enough. They aren't super greasy either. I'm sure they're not the healthiest for you... it's pizza. But I usually never feel all bloated or nasty after sharing one. The Pomme Frites are divine too. They fry them in duck fat (I know, typical CLE trend now), toss them with sea salt, rosemary and garlic and serve them in a cone of paper. You'll also get ketchup and three dipping sauces to try. This is not a healthy treat, but an awesome indulgence for a late night snack.   The happy hours are pretty reasonable too. Not as great as some of the other sneaker-picks around C-Town, but still good. I mean, I'm not going to complain about a $3 draft Hoegaarden."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times now - guess it's time to write this review.  Every experience has been the same - so it's safe to say that service/food are consistent. I'm going to base this review off of my most recent visit:  It was a beautiful night to stroll over to the bier markt. They keep their social media/website updated which is fabulous! I LOVE this because so many other restaurants aren't being nearly as proactive and it's really nice to know exactly what's on special, especially when it comes to the beers on draft.   My boyfriend LOVES sour beers and they had a very good selection. So good in fact, that the options practically overwhelmed us. The best part of this was that the bartenders were wonderful at letting us sample till we each found something we really enjoyed. One bartender really discussed the complexity and flavors of the few that were her personal faves. *high five to that bad ass chick* Damn it all! I didn't even ask her for her name.    They had the air-conditioning running at frigid temps. (I don't remember if it's always like this.) This is the only negative thing I can say about last night's experience. It was easy to fix. We paid out and found seating at the cafe tables along the side of the street. The weather had cooled off considerably outside and it was really enjoyable to take in the sights and sounds of summer on W25th!"}
{"text":"I got the pizza because everyone tells you to. It was very good. I loved my olive appetizer as well! We will be back."}
{"text":"Good friendly service. Clean. The food was all great. And they carry a fantastically wide range of Belgian Beers. Kitchen is open late. Nothing bad to say about this pace.    Get the mussels frites!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great place to throw a Party/Function.  We threw my friend's 30th Birthday there, and the employees could not have been nicer or more accommodating.  They allowed us to use the downstairs Speakeasy space, free of charge, and let us decorate! The one caveat of having the downstairs for free was that after 9pm, they allowed other patrons to enter.  We didn't mind because they just either joined the party, or were turned off by all the decorations, and went back to the upstairs bar.  We ordered food to provide for guests, and when the food didn't come out at the proper time, they comp'd half of it (which wasn't necessary at all...)  We brought in our own cake (from A Cookie and a Cupcake - highly recommended) and they allowed us to keep in the kitchen, lit the candles for us, and brought it out to the birthday girl.  They went above and beyond to make us feel welcome, and it was truly appreciated.   I will definitely use them for functions in the future - and the staff couldn't have been easier to work with.    Oh, the beer selection is wonderfully robust, and the food is delish.  My one warning is that the drinks can be a little pricey, but nothing too over the top."}
{"text":"I only had the signature potato fries and a Hoegaarden draft, but I loved the atmosphere and the overall vibe. The garlic-and-rosemary-seasoned fries were good, especially the crispy ones at the bottom."}
{"text":"You had me at egg on pizza.  Before I left for Cleveland, I researched beer establishments on Yelp. That was a good move! Bier Markt was 1.6 miles away from our conference hotel, and we had to take a cab to get there. However, it was worth it! It was the best meal we had in five days in Cleveland! I ordered the Sunnyside, a pizza that has eggs on it! I haven't been able to get it out of my mind since. I crave it constantly! The combination of flavors and textures was perfect! I posted a picture of this pizza on Facebook and talked about it so much that a friend attending the same conference went the next day to get it! In addition to the Sunnyside, I had three lovely Belgian ales including one of my favorites, Leffe Blonde. The beer list is great, and the prices aren't horrendous. My friends and I also split a chocolate mousse, which was delicious. If you go anywhere near Cleveland, I highly recommend checking out Bier Markt!"}
{"text":"So this review is solely based on the pizza since that's the only thing we ate. IT WAS AMAZING! If you like thin crust pizza you'll love it. The crust was perfectly crunchy while the center was gooey. The Margarita pizza was our favorite. Not big enough to share, but you'll want your own!"}
{"text":"Good service, decent pizza. 3 stars because they tried their best to offer vegan options. Had the vegan pizza, which was cooked a couple minutes too long. It also was skimpy on the toppings for an $11 pizza; I would like to see more than a few artichoke leaves. Side salad was good, tomatoes and lettuce tasted freshly picked. Service was slow but the waitress was very nice and accommodating. The addition of a couple more vegan options would definitely have me back. Also, keep up the farm to table concept."}
{"text":"I'm not a beer drinking so if you're finding reviews on beer suggestions, you might not want to read along.  All I can tell you about their beer is..all my friends love it. They love the selection.  Food: I like bier markt food. True, it's not super unique and super flavorful, but for a bar-ish place, the food is good. The one food to try is their fries. Their rosemary fries come with 4 different sauces to dip in and it is soooooo good. It's a bit expensive (I thought $12?) but it's to good to not pay for it. Their happy hour burger is also made pretty well so definitely try that too.  Why I come here? the atmosphere. The basement has more of a dance floor feel to it and the upstairs is a more classy bar room. I also love the amount of space in here and just the entire atmosphere."}
{"text":"We were strolling around Ohio City on a Saturday afternoon and stumbled upon this place, primarily because Great Lakes had a really long wait time and we weren't willing to eat a bunch of West Side Market jerky for lunch. Upon first glance, this place looks like a weirdly fancy restaurant when you look inside. But it was completely empty, in fact, I thought they were close. Eventually, we wandered in anyway and made our way back to the bar, realizing moments later that a hostess had appeared back at the hostess stand. We went back and asked if we needed to be seated with her, but she said we could sit anywhere, so we did that and then found our own menus at a nearby table.  We ordered 2 pizzas between 3 of us, and they were decent. I had the Mediterranean pizza, and it had good flavor, but was not anything extraordinary. I'm not a beer drinker so I did not drink, but maybe that is their strong suit. It definitely felt like more of a bar atmosphere than a restaurant. Not a great place for lunch.  As Ohio City expands, I think that there will be more options for nearby restaurants. I hope that this place steps up their game accordingly."}
{"text":"I have only been in here towards the end of a night out drinking with my fiance and his buddies. I was introduced to the rosemary pomme frites by my fiances best friend. Needless to say, 2 yrs later, its the only thing I order. So flippin good...i promise you, you will find yourself craving them in the future! Comes with 4 dipping sauces...garlic aioli the best!"}
{"text":"Even if you're not a beer / food snob, check this place out.  They have awesome appetizer specials, and the pizzas can be out of this world (The one I got had I think pancetta, parmasan cheese and a bunch of other goodies, best pizza i've ever had - including ones Ive made myself.)    The beer menu is arguably the best in Cleveland for Belgian beers, and their samplers are worth trying if you want a variety.  They give a great description of each beer in their menu, and their staff is always friendly.    Had no problem with larger or smaller groups, and even tho the prices are a little higher... you're going to a fine restaurant so suck it up."}
{"text":"I've been to both Bier Markt and Bar Cento before, though I'm not a big beer fan so I'm only going to review the food.  I've eaten a couple different pizzas here as well as their fries and charcuterie board.  The food has been pretty good, though it's a bit disappointing that their options other than pizzas/burger are on the expensive side.  They do offer a variety of pizzas, some with a few oddball toppings such as potatos or eggs.  The fries are served with a variety of dipping sauces, all of which are pretty tasty.  The charcuterie board was also pretty good.  The atmosphere is good for groups, and the waitstaff seem nice.  Overall, I've had good experiences here, just a bit on the expensive side."}
{"text":"This review is strictly for the Bier Markt because even though they're connected I consider Bar Centro an entirely different place for an entirely different occasion.   I love Bier Markt. It is probably my favorite bar in Cleveland (I've been to em all). They have plenty of tasty craft beers and all of the staples. The place is spacious and the crowds are usually all easy going people who are just having a good time so even when it is crowded there is not a whole lot of the \"come at me bro\" contingent. I will say one thing we have noticed and talked about with the Markt is that the crowd can be entirely different from one night to the next. One night you can have artsy horned rim glasses type, the next you can stumble upon 5 or 6 routy bachelorette parties. It's just a great place. Also, as a newly single person in my 30's it is a great place to meet new people without having to wade through the \"hey brah\" \"Erie shore\" crowd on West 6th.  If you haven't been there you should give it a try, and while you're there you should get a pizza from nearby bar centro. It will change your life :)"}
{"text":"I have only come here for drinks a handful of times but the selection is great! The choices are really unique, service has always been good, and the atmosphere is fun.   I like the location, W25th is a fun area. Parking can be a pain, but this place is worth it. I come here to grab drinks with friends. It can get pretty crowded on a Friday night."}
{"text":"Nothing that I could see on their menu for a vegan to nom on. The beer selection was pretty good, but overpriced. The atmosphere was pretty slick. But a decent place nonetheless."}
{"text":"Ever since moving to Cleveland in 2008, this is one of my go-to restaurants. Great happy hours, great beer selection, awesome food. I always get the Ohio beef burger and the pomme frites to share.   When I first started going to the Markt, the burger was by far the best burger I've ever had in a restaurant like this. Juicy meat, soft round and shiny bun, caramelized onions and cheese...all you need is a little ketchup and this burger is good to go.   I am only giving the restaurant 4 stars because I think they have recently changed their burger and something isn't quite the same- I think it's the bun. Wow, what a difference it makes. But it's still good...just not as good as it once was.   And of course, the pomme frites! BOMBass if I might say. Explosion of rosemary and garlic and salty goodness...and the dipping sauces to top it all off. WOW. And if you're feeling it, an ice cold beer to wash it down. Perfection.   Great place. Great all around and one of my personal Cleveland favorites."}
{"text":"Very cool place on the inside so I'll give it 4 stars, food is just a 3 though. Sadly their fries are fried in duck fat  which I found out after I ate a bunch. They are delicious, but the frying in duck fat is gross and unnecessary. Vegetarians and vegans already have limited options. I also got the veggie burger which was pretty blah. Bread was hard, patty was pretty hard out the outside too... little flavor.  I am not much of a beer drinker but I got a bourbon cider which was delicious."}
{"text":"Hands down, my favorite place for beer, the best selection of quality beer. I'll vote it \"Most like NYC,\" if you're into that, as far as far as atmosphere goes. Love the decor.  I've met new friends here as well. Social Scene: Many different types here, but mostly young professionals. At times there has been both male and female snobbery (these types robbed this place of the 5th star), but nothing a mature adult can't brush off, right? ;) Drinks are served with a smile from very attractive and knowledgeable bartenders. Definitely a place to take out-of-towners."}
{"text":"Really dug this place prior to 2011, but I'm either getting old or the crowd is getting douchier, because the vibe is not at all like it was before. Still, both Bier and Speakeasy are good prior to 10:30 or so. After that, too loud, too crowded, too obnoxious."}
{"text":"Literally next door to Market Garden brewpub and Nanobrew Cleveland. Inside is a cramped, uninteresting near dive bar ambiance with low red lighting. Medium to smaller bar with a decent amount of taps. Some strange beers on tap like Flying Dog one-offs and the Victory/Market Garden collaboration beer. Their kitchen was also open past midnight and our group somehow ordered an entire pepperoni pizza served to us at the bar. Interesting place to stop in after Market Garden brewpub."}
{"text":"Went to Bier Market tonight, Tuesday.  Not one other person in the restaurant or at the bar.  My husband and I ordered dinner and waited and waited and waited.  After 14 minutes I asked the bartender/server if our salads would be out soon.  He apologized for it taking so long and said he would check.  He said they had a party of 25 in back.  He never did return and after 20 minutes we just left.  A party of 25 should not be an excuse.  They are a restaurant after all.  Will not return.  Went over to LaPetite Triangle and had an exceptional meal and excellent service."}
{"text":"If you don't like beer, more specifically if you don't appreciate the higher level of quality in craft beer, there's really no reason to get out of bed. You live in a very dark place without hope or joy or irony. At least from my perspective that is...  Bier Markt is a celebration of those finer things in life made from fermented grains and hops. This Belgian brew joint features a rotating selection of 8 drafts and over 80 bottles to choose from. The majority as you probably guessed, of the Belgian variety.   The happy hour specials are pretty damn good too. Personally, I recommend the $4 pommes frites and the $6 organic Belgian burger paired with a Duvel. Otherwise, Bier Markt shares a kitchen with the neighboring Bar Cento, so the menu offerings are quite adequate.   Gezondheid! (a Dutch toast meaning: \"to your health\")."}
{"text":"I had the mushroom pizza and my husband had the one with eggs on it, forgot the name. Both were very good! Our friends had the burger and they both had good things to say about it.   Took a while to find the hostess on Saturday night...to the point where I was taking my phone out to call the restaurant letting them know we are sitting outside until my husband finally tracked her down after ten minutes, maybe even longer. Literally, no exaggeration. I'm not sure where she was or what she was doing, but if I was the owner of this place, I'd be pretty pissed off as this does not look good for business. You can't have people go into a restaurant and stand there for longer than A MINUTE without someone greeting them. Then it took a while for the waiter to come to us. But once we finally ordered, things got better, but by that point, you're slightly annoyed with the place. I would come back again for the pizza, though I hope it won't take so long to be seated and welcomed next time around. If it does, I won't be back a third time.  Four stars if it wasn't for the service."}
{"text":"If my rating was solely based on the service and the food, I would've given Bier Markt five stars. Our server was pleasant and on point. The food (I ordered the mushroom pizza with pancetta, my husband ordered the spicy chicken pizza, and we shared a side of fries) was delicious!  The reasons I'm giving it three stars: 1. We could not order any draft beers because their beer taps weren't working. Huge disappointment for my husband since that was our main reason for going there. 2. They were out of the ravioli AND the chicken entrees. I feel like when you only have a handful of options for customers to order from, it's extremely important to have everything available. Especially since we were there on a Monday evening, not even on a busy night when it's feasible that they sold out of it. 3. We saw a lot of kitchen staff coming in and out of the front doors. Not that big of a deal, but a little distracting and it did take away from the \"ambiance\" of the restaurant.   Bottom line: Food and service were excellent, but it probably won't be a first choice for us the next time we're in the area."}
{"text":"It makes me sad to give Bier Markt  only 3 stars, because it really is one of my favorite places in town! With a great beer, wine and cocktail selection, great food and knowledgeable staff, what more could one want?  Servers and owners who give a damn. Who at least pretend like they appreciate your business and want you to come back. I've been coming here regularly since they opened and at one point, my friends and I were there multiple times a week.... you'd think that the server would say \"hey! welcome back! good to see you guys again!\" anything! but no, the attitude of most of the servers is that they just want to take my order so they can get back to the conversation they were having with their friends at the bar. (most of whom, work there or have worked there at one point) Don't get me wrong....not all the servers are like that. but most are.  I bartend, and work in the industry...... i guess i'm just expecting that little something extra...."}
{"text":"I stopped here after visiting the West Side Market. This bar is a winner with their happy hours. Where else can you get Warsteiner on draft for $3 every evening of the week?   I really appreciated that the bartender stopped me from ordering a beer that he didn't like. He gave me a sample of the questionable beer and then recommended a different beer. He was right.   Overall, I thought the prices were pretty reasonable, the menu looked delicious, and the bartender was really helpful."}
{"text":"The best pommes frites anywhere!   Seriously, either here or Bar Cento, you got to have the fries. Oops, frites.  The pizzas are pretty good too!"}
{"text":"This is one of the greatest places in Cleveland by far. They play great music and have great music. What's better than that?"}
{"text":"I have only been here once, but that is all that is needed to know this place is GREAT!    The have a ridiculous amount of Belgian beers on tap...and who doesn't love a good Belgian beer!? My mouth is salivating as I think about the Leffe Trippel that tingled when it hit my lips.  This place fills the hunger inside me.  They also have Delirium Tremens and of course Chimay!  And, for the non beer connoisseur they have Blue Moon.    It's not pretentious at all!  The bar tender helped find the beer that was just right for my palette :)  I will be sure to return next time I'm in town.  Also, it's conveniently located by Great Lakes Brewing Company (a local favorite) and the Westside Market!  It only gets 4 stars because it was so crowed we had to sit outside.  I guess that's what happens when you're the hottest beer joint in the market district after 10p.m."}
{"text":"We stopped in and wanted a beer. The hostess didn't greet us. We went to the bar to find seating for the six of us. It took over 10 minutes for the bartender to acknowledge us, even though he walked right by us. We were about to leave.  Service was once he took our order.  They also has two TVs dedicated to deer hunting that is not appropriate for a nice bar.  I would not go back and would no recommend."}
{"text":"Belgian beer in a cozy dark wood interior with lots of seating. Many delicious beer to choose from, but slightly marred by the number of taps which were out."}
{"text":"We came here after shopping at the West Side Market - it was a hot, sunny day and we needed some refreshment!  I was with my boyfriend and his family, and we all sat out on the patio for some people watching.  Even on a hot day, we felt cool under the umbrella and got plenty of refreshing shade.  They have a wonderful Belgian beer selection - they claim it to be the best between Chicago and New York, and I can't argue with that.  I actually got a Belgian style beer brewed in New York - oops - called Ommegang Wit, and it was delicious.  The descriptions of all the beers are detailed and accurate, so you know what you are getting.  And they have framboise on draft!  mmmm.  The food all sounded delicious - we got the pommes frites with dipping sauces \"for the table,\" along with an order of mussels, and the olive tapenade pizza.  Everything was really tasty - the fries were AMAZING.  I hear they are fried in duck fat, and they had the most addictive rosemary-garlic flavor.  The white sauce, an aioli of some sort, was our favorite.  The mussels were fresh and tasted like the ocean, but their presentation was a bit....rustic.  They didn't appear to have been scrubbed (still had sand in them) and they still had beards attached.  But the taste was pretty excellent.  We also enjoyed the pizza, which had a lovely fresh olive flavor, and a divinely thin, crispy crust.    Great food, wonderful drink selection, friendly service, and a pleasant place to relax on a Saturday afternoon.  What more could we want?  Worth going for the fries and beer alone!"}
{"text":"Based on drinks and service alone, I easily give this place 5 stars. I did not have food and only ordered one beer, but I would come back for sure.  The beer list was pretty good, I had a breckenridge porter. The highlight for me was the service. The bartender was extremely friendly and helpful. We mentioned that we were visiting from out of town for the first time and he was happy to give lots of suggestions. We were even able to get a dialogue going with a couple near us at the bar. The environment was chill and classy, I really enjoyed it. Based on the small experience I had, I have nothing negative to say."}
{"text":"I am semiconfused as to which bar I was in, was it this one or Bar Cento but I think it was this one.  I was a little worried when I saw that it was a Belgium beer place since I am a fan of hoppy beers mostly, but they had an IPA of the week and I totally dug it.  I went here before the Ingenuity Fest and had some kind of black ipa, and then when I came back they were onto something else that was really tasty, I think a double ipa.  The crowd here was a little rowdy for my taste but it was Friday night and there was a festival going on down the street, but it seemed like most of the people there weren't at the festival, who knows though.  I really dug the outside seating and spent most of my time there outside.  I didn't eat but saw people getting pizza and fries and they looked amazing.  Definitely would go back, maybe on a chiller night though."}
{"text":"Huge puddle of meh. Mussels and frites weren't anything to write home about.... Draft selection decent, really loud atmosphere."}
{"text":"I love coming here on Saturday afternoons or early in the evening. The speakeasy in the basement is a fun novelty when it's open, but it's not in danger of being confused with the sublime Velvet Tango Room. Besides, we're here for the beer and I'm way too old to deal with the crowds as the weekend nights wear on anyway. That aside, every time I'm here, I'm happy. The setting is good, the servers are friendly and knowledgeable, and the Belgian-heavy beer selection is scrumptious and diverse. This review is for liquid refreshments only. The food here comes out of Bar Cento's kitchen, so if you're interested in eating here, check out those reviews."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time to watch the Cavs game. Got the spaghetti and did not like it. It was topped with regular marinara sauce, but it just didn't taste right. Definitely not worth $20! Their fries were good though!Service was also pretty bad. Don't see myself coming back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Party Party Party!  This was our 2nd stop after a visit to the old angle tavern.  Downstairs to the speakeasy is where the party is at!  Very mixed crowd and I heard the drinks were good (I don't drink but i'll take everyone else's word for it).   We partied until about 2am and had a blast.  Very fun times and the DJ was kind enough to play some of our requested songs.  I'd give this place 5 stars if the DJ had been better at keeping us on the dance floor."}
{"text":"Excellent selection of Beers, great place in the summertime to sit back and relax."}
{"text":"Wow, this couldn't even meet my already low expectations. First, what is it with Cleveland refusing to turn on the AC?? Second, we ordered flights, and the glasses were so tight in the weird ass hipster flight carriers that we couldn't get the glasses out of the carriers without spilling all over the place. Next the PLT wrap. Wow, what a disappointment. Whose idea was it to roll the whole thing in flour before bringing it out? Also it would've been great had there been any sauce on the wrap, but no, the only liquid In the entire thing came from the damp lettuce and mealy tomatoes. It's supposed to be an \"Indian naan wrap,\" but clearly this person had never been to an Indian restaurant before because idk what the hell it was, but it sure wasn't naan. What a mess."}
{"text":"Someone please take away my credit cards! Please!  I absolutely love Bier Markt! I gladly cross the Cuyahoga for it!  First, its about beer - delicious, life-giving, amazing beer. You want it, they have it. Always an impressive array of local and regional craft breweries and amazing imports from Belgium and beyond. The staff know what they're talking about too. Ask about a beer and you'll get an earful! That's plain amazing to me!  Second, its about food. Bier Markt and Bar Cento share a menu and that's A-OK. They have a noteworthy selection of delicious and fanciful pizzas. But, thats not what I usually get. Find me at the bar and you'll see me enjoy a (very generous) plate of Belgian-style pommes frites. Yes, with three delicious dipping sauces and, of course, ketchup. The fires are fat, long and perfectly seasoned (salt, garlic and rosemary).  The atmosphere Mon-Wed evenings is usually calm but it picks up rather quickly once the weekend hits. It seems anyone with taste bypasses W. 6th and heads to Ohio City to enjoy Clevealnd's best place for good beer!  5 Stars? Oh, yeah!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  Open till 2am everyday!  The menu is always different due to their usage of local ingredients.  You can't go wrong ordering a pizza and the garlic rosemary fries with the dipping sauces( garlic, curry,chili) are the best in Ohio City.  I recommend going on a Sunday after 10pm.  There is usually not a crowd and Eddie will be your bartender.  This is a good thing!"}
{"text":"Always great atmosphere, great bartenders. It feels like they got the best tasting beer over there. Also like the mussels"}
{"text":"Bier Markt is all around a solid place! Wether you're coming for date night , happy hour, or a late night drink you'll be impressed with this place! Bar cento is the wine bar connected to the other side, (hint: they offer the same food).   I really like the set up at bier Markt. There's a long booth along the wall with tables that'll sit 2 or 4.   Oh and did I mention happy hour? I think it is 3-7 during the week. Try the $5 burger and the frites, that is all you need to know my friend!"}
{"text":"Kelsey waited on me and did an amazing job.  She is skilled, friendly and knowledgeable.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"While there are tons of options in Ohio City for great beer, not many specialize in Belgian Ales. They offer pages of great beers to please any beer palate, but their offerings in Belgian Ales are unsurpassed. Belgians are sweet, thicker ales that are high in ABV and very filling. Tripels, Quads, Abbey Ales and the like are here in all their goblet-filling glory waiting for you to enjoy. They also carry a great selection of beers from local breweries as well if you aren't in the mood for the sweet, Belgian style ale. Worth a visit anytime you are in Ohio City."}
{"text":"Classy bar that i actually enjoyed (typically i like hole in the walls). When we went it was dead but it was a monday night. They had good seating and a pool table. Overall I liked the ambiance. They didnt have Jameson or Dark and Stormy's thought."}
{"text":"Every single time I come to Cleveland I go and get my delicious fries. I was however disappointed to hear that Eddie was no longer working at the bar. The flatbread pizza is really tasty as well. The fact that the fries are cooked in duck fat is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"4 stars based on the speakeasy style bar in the basement. Only had drinks but the set up is great, and the drinks are made well. Very comfortable, good lighting. Definitely worth visiting."}
{"text":"Me and a few friends went here on a Saturday night around 8. We got a table in the bar area. In the 2.5 hour period we sat there to drink and order food, our waiter came 3 times. The food (a flatbread, a burger and a plate of fries) took over an hour. We were comp'd drinks by a different waitress when we asked about our food because not only was our food not in sight but our waiter was still MIA. I really want to like this place because they have good music, a variety of beers and a cool atmosphere, but the service was just plain awful. I'll be taking my money to Town Hall next time..."}
{"text":"Love the feel of this place. The beer selection is amazing and the burger and frites are awe-inspiring.  One day I will have to try something else on the menu. (Maybe). I also love that all three times I've been here the clientele looks incredibly different."}
{"text":"One of the best happy hours in Cleveland.   As Cara L. said in her review about Bar Cento/Bier Markt, this place brings in quite a mixed crowd of people. I guess this translates to the likability of Bier Markt and that it doesn't just cater to one kind of food/beer/wine snob. I'm a fan of the happy hour steamed mussels in butter and Duvel as well as their amazing pizza. If you come to Bier Markt/Bar Cento for anything, it would be their pizza. Next to 3 Palms in Hudson, this place has the best pizza in the NEO region. It's crispy and you can tell it's made with the best ingredients available.   In general, the wide variety of stuff on their happy hour menu doesn't even touch the surface of the food and beer offerings here. I also recommend the olive tapenade pizza and their Sunnyside pizza. Never thought eggs on pizza could work until I tried it.  Highly recommended restaurant in the Ohio City Neighborhood. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Waited for an hour for food, and the waitress was very rude, never filled my water, not even asking if we wanted dessert after, clashing all the dishes, and when asked for more water, she just brought in the water bottle and never poured for us. Food was good but man why was the service so bad! There were almost nobody here either! Will never be back again!"}
{"text":"The restaurant looks good from outside and the inside. Very busy on a Saturday night when I went. Known for their pizza so had to check it out.  I ordered a Marinera pizza with pepperoni. Also had the amazing Kwak belgian beer. The pizza was thin crust and decent. With the pepperoni, I believe it cost like $12. The pizza for the cost was very small, almost like a personal panned sized pizza. I wasn't starving so shared pizza with a friend, but if I was starving, one pizza wouldn't be enough for me. Typical Belgian pub, which I enjoy just to drink Kwak. I'd go back again to try something else on their menu."}
{"text":"Pizza was yummy the portion was pretty big. I couldn't finish the pizza myself. We also order burger and mussels for appetizer. Nice wine selection too."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place! What a super cute looking atmosphere, great friendly service, a menu I have never seen in a Bier place (especially in Florida when I'm from)  Great selection of Belgian beers, quail? On a beer place menu? What's this? Chocolate beet cake? Man, was I sorry I ate before I went there.  BUT, I did meet some awesome people, had some great beers, played fetch with a dog inside (another no no in Florida) and enjoyed happy hour at a really off time!  God, please let them open one in Florida, pleeeasse"}
{"text":"I am pretty sure this review is for Bier Markt, but if I'm being honest, I don't really know the difference between this and Bar Cento. I know I've been in both bars and have ordered drinks and food in both and have had equally good experiences. I have yet to check out the speakeasy.   This is definitely one of the more beautiful bars in Ohio City. The front of the restaurant has some really sexy seating - private booths with dim lighting with swaths of fabric hanging overhead. Nice!  Adding to the ambiance is the most amazing music selection that I've ever heard in a bar. Of course, I'm biased because their playlist seems to be pretty much a cross section of my own ipod: The Smiths, The Shins, The Cure, New Order.. it just adds to the dark, sexy vibe here.  I really enjoy Lindeman's Framboise and they have it on tap!  The food is delicious, and the happy hour prices can't be beat! The frites are amazing, of course, and the Sunnyside pizza was what started my love affair with eggs cracked over pizza. Yum!!  Overall, this is such a great place... I only wish there was a bigger / better patio, but most of the time, I don't really want to go outside even on nice nights because the interior is so special."}
{"text":"This is my favorite bar in the U.S., hands down. The service can be a bit hit and miss, but the beer and the ambiance more than made up for it. Being a Belgian beer fan, their selection on tap is amazing, and the beer flight is a great deal. And the fries are to die for. Whenever I'm in Cleveland, this is my first stop!!"}
{"text":"My relationship with Bier Markt has been one of many ups and downs. Now that Town Hall opened up and stolen the yuppie lightning rod, I can come back to Bier Markt and enjoy a beverage with little interruption. And the basement is no longer a cheesy dance room."}
{"text":"I can't say anything about this establishment because the servers were not willing to accommodate our group. Our group of seven was  there on a Sunday evening. There were six other people on the front patio and plenty  of open tables. However, the patio is not open if you only want a cocktail. The servers made that clear so we took our business else where.  I won't rush back."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and prices. Disappointed they use premade morning star veggie burgers instead of making their own...just seems lazy."}
{"text":"From what was on tap I didn't notice the selection of specialty beers that I know this place to have so I just got a Stella. However the service was quick for it being so busy - we were recognised quick at the standing room only bar. The place was packed (Saturday - even at 10pm) which provided for a fun, but yet still chill atmosphere. Conversation was still possible - only difficult at times owing to the crowd, not obnoxious music. This was my first 'late night' here and I definitely think this is 'the spot' to be - or at least one of them on the street."}
{"text":"They have great selections of craft beers here, and I love their table fries! It comes with three different dipping sauces and cooked with whole cloves of garlic and fresh rosemary. I love the garlic, but prepare to be a human repellent for a couple days because it will be seeping out of your pores!  There is a pool table on the first floor that is coin-operated and a large basement, where events and bands play at. They used to offer a DJ with great music in the basement, but they ended that a couple years ago. I heard that it was due to the crowd rowdiness. Sad... Because it was the only \"dance\" type venue in Ohio City aside from the Touch Supper Club last Saturday of the month hip hop night.  I had my graduation party here a few years back, and they are very accommodating! They gave us the entire back room area, and everyone had a good time with great service and delicious bites! I have attended several events in the basement, and they typically serve a variety of pizzas, table fries and the antipasto meat and cheese platter. Everything has always been delicious from here!"}
{"text":"As you enter you may get the impression you're entering a really nice place, then,BooM! you hit the real bar. Im joking, It is very nice up front, I never sat and had dinner, everyone says its not too bad. I think the look outweighs the quality though, ill update when I find out.  I have grown a new liking to this place since that.. place opened across the street. Good draft selection. Never had a bad IPA of the week. I like the seating arrangements and layout of the place. Downstairs is another bar, real dark setting, if I have enough drinks ill cut some rug down there given the right situation.  25th as a whole is dwindling down. Back to Tremont, on to claim new territory. Stay tuned."}
{"text":"Bier Markt ... I like it!  Not much going on when I stopped in, kind of chill bar next to/attached to Bar Cento, but the beer selection is pretty good, the food is pretty good and the prices (especially the specials) are pretty good!  The beer they serve is mostly (if not all?) Belgian. So if you're not a fan, you probably wouldn't want to stop by.  Happy hour has some good deals: $3 Stella, $5 Duvel green, and $5/6 pizzas and burgers.  Good beer, relaxed atmosphere ... what more do you want?"}
{"text":"I don't know about cuttin rug down in the speakeasy, but that's my place. Even a sign painted on the wall pretty much says it all before you go in : no douchefullery. Which is my style dark and rustic, just old school and awesome drinks. The speakeasy conjures up a very nice menu of craft cocktails both old school and new school. From absinthe to a vast variety of whiskeys all the way to a selection of different bitters! I don't bother getting cocktails anywhere else. The bartenders down there know what they are doing."}
{"text":"Food ok. Service ok. Beer/wine selection looks amazing, though many were unavailable. Open late! Booths very uncomfortable."}
{"text":"I've only been to Bier Market once, but my experience was great! The only \"downfall\" was that it took a few extra minutes for someone to greet and seat us- which wasn't even a big deal! I was shocked at how crowded this place was on a Sunday night - probably serves as an indication that this place is good!   I had the Sunnyside pizza (with no pancetta- I'm a vegetarian). Never had eggs on a pizza, but they made it work! There was a bit too much black pepper for my taste, but that's just because I'm not the biggest fan of black pepper.  I had the Kwak beer and loved it! I wasn't sure about it at first, so the waitress was wonderful and brought a sample, but it definitely met my expectations! It comes in a contraption with a rounded glass- pretty cool presentation, but I wouldn't be able to handle it if I was drunk!   All in all, great experience and I will definitely returning to try some of the other food! I'm giving this place a 4 mainly b/c this review is based on one experience- I'll update it after a repeat trip!"}
{"text":"I love this place. My friends like to go there on Mondays. They have some happy hour selections available all day Monday. Some beer and drinks and food items. We just got some beer and the sale fries - fried with the rosemary. I like the big fries better with the dipping sauces. Friends got pizza, a burger... The burger is really good - all these things on the happy hour menu. Staff always super friendly! OK well, friendly isn't the word, they are cool... they take care of you... good service - they do a good job. The place is cute and interesting looking. When I am not lazy I like venturing onto the extensive beer list. Bier Markt! It's spelled weird! Check it out!"}
{"text":"Good pizza and excellent  fries...not where you want to come if you are watching your weight!! The bar also has an excellent beer and mixed drink list.  This is a fun neighborhood and I'm not sure why anyone wouldn't want to stop by and check this place out??"}
{"text":"This is my favorite beer joint on west 25th. It's a nice balance of trendy, not too crowded and probably the easier place to get a draft without waiting too long. They reopened the dance hall downstairs again or if you just wanted to lounge there's plenty of seating and even a pool table. The food is yum also. Fries are seasoned with whole garlic cloves and Rosemary. They are regular cut so some of them get a little soggy ( I prefer thin and crispy). Burgers are juicy as well. Happy hour is from 4-7 with a limited beer happy hour list."}
{"text":"omg the pizza was ridiculously good. didn't try any beer but had a drink it was good in flavor but not strong enough for the price... over all i would go again!"}
{"text":"Took my mother to this restaurant over the weekend and the service was terrible. We waited about 20 minutes to be seated although there was plenty of empty seating in the restaurant. Our waitress was training a new hire and completely forgot to come back around to pick up the check. My mother literally has to walk around the restaurant to find her and request that our check be picked up. The waitress laughed and said she \"forgot about us\". Food was decent but took nearly 40 minutes to come out. Would not recommend and will not return."}
{"text":"Overall, this was the best place I visited while in Cleveland.  The beer selection is quite good, with a mix of microbrews, mass produced, and european beers.  The happy  hour is also quite generous in lasting until 7pm.  The veggie burger was very good for a prefab... they cooked it nice and crispy and yum.  The best part though, by far, were the rosemary and garlic fries.  There were huge chunks of rosemary that just seeped into the fries, giving them a very good and interesting taste.  They were among the best fries I've had, and I could definitely see myself eating here way too often.  Very good food for relatively low prices, especially during happy hour."}
