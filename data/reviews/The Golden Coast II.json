{"text":"Is this the best Chinese restaurant in the area? No.. but is it the best Chinese restaurant that delivers in the area? Definitely. If you want a Chinese take out in the University area that has better than average food and speedy service this is definitely the one to choose. Now with online ordering as well? Even better. I've only ever ordered food delivered from them (never eaten in the restaurant) but the majority of times the food was good.   I've tried others that deliver in the area (with decent Yelp ratings) and was always disappointed by things like mushy overcooked rice and lukewarm food at best.  For this area of the city? This is the Chinese delivery that seems to have the most consistently decent food and service."}
{"text":"GOT TOE MIGHTY!!  I'm not sure why people eat here. But I can tell you the reason why I did. Because I was starving. If you're not picky about how your meat taste or how fatty it is,  then this is the place for you. My meal had chicken and beef in it. That was the most disgusting crap I've ever eaten. The beef was chewy. It had been the lowest grade of meet I've ever eaten. I was going to get the beef ribs but that was the reason I didn't get them was because they may be too fatty or too chewy. I guess this is why I always eat vegetables when I eat at Chinese restaurants because their meat sucks. So please, don't be spontaneous and try this place you'll be pis-ssed and waste your money."}
{"text":"I have ordered from here for a while and have never had a problem until the last two times. They give you these coupons and the last two times the driver has not taking it off and I always tip. I called to complain both times and they will not refund you your money all they say is next time you call I'll take it off which did not happen. The food is great to me and my kids love it but I can't order from an honest place who promotes discounts an never applies it but then forces the tip in you at the same time. If I dont mind tipping for a service if the service is done correctly... Never again!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! It's our go-to take-out place, and they deliver SO FAST!! We love the egg drop soup, pork with garlic sauce, etc. General Tso's chicken is good, but not amazing... but everything else is!!  Get a shrimp roll, pork with garlic sauce, and pork fried rice... you won't regret it! :)"}
{"text":"Happened to be in the area and was craving Chinese at the time, so I thought I'd try this place. \"How bad could it be\", you can't really go wrong with Chinese....Boy was I wrong. The food was awful. I had the Won Ton soup which was very bland, and it didn't have green onions, like the typical Won Ton soup. I also had the beef fried rice, which lacked in flavor and was more of a steamed brown rice. The beef wasn't edible being that I couldn't chew it. Lastly the spring roll was cold and tasted as if it had been sitting for awhile. I hate giving bad reviews, but this place was horrible. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Going down the middle on this one...ordered for take out through Yelp...don't do it...direction is as clear as mud. No confirmation but a message saying it could take 45-60 minutes for the order to process so stay close to my phone.   The food...trying for the first time so ordered a variety.  Ordered wonton soup but good egg drop-tasteless,  ordered hot and sour soup neither hot nor sour - won't bother next time.  Next boneless ribs...really good!  Chicken and broccoli-  bland.  Moo shu pork-delicious, flavorful and crunchy!  Also ordered steamed dumplings - outstanding!  Be careful leaving this location. Not a lot of drivers understand pedestrian right of way or what it means if someone stops for someone walking across the road...nearly got run over by an unaware black Honda Civic"}
{"text":"Save yourself and go somewhere else. Ordered the scallion chicken. It was basically soy sauce tossed on fried chicken. Also ordered general tso's chicken. It was alright but not that great. It came with \"fried rice\" which tasted like cardboard. The spring roll was also a disappointment. And even the fortune cookie was not good. I wish I had decided to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"The only reason i used to get take-out from this place was it is conveniently located within the shopping area i frequent. I always knew food was below standards, the place was not hygienic, but still continued for years. Eventually i stopped ordering from them after i came across a pubic hair in my food (literally, i am not exaggerating). In fact, i did not have Chinese food for couple of month before going to other Chinese restaurants"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff including drivers has made this my family and I's go-to for over a decade. Chicken wings are crispy and delish and their signature dishes are always heaping portions. My favorite is the steamed dumplings and Crispy Duck. I highly recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"I went to this location for lunch.  I cannot eat rice nor lo mein, so I asked the lady at the counter could I substitute them for all vegetables.  She flat out said no.  Due to having weight loss surgery I cannot eat a lot of rice and pasta.  Most Chinese restaurants will substitute and up charge the difference.  I will not return to this location for this reason alone."}
{"text":"These delivery drivers are the nicest but not always the quickest. Pretty average time, but I live at the back of a suburb, so I get it. The fried rice is yummy and so are the spring rolls. I always get the sesame tofu, which is good the first time around but don't bother trying to reheat leftovers. They were giving out chinese calendars with delivery orders for a while and that was a thoughtful advertising tool."}
{"text":"This has been our take out joint of choice for 6 years. Is it the best? No. But it's close to home, inexpensive, and tastes good."}
{"text":"I am very skeptical when it comes to ordering Chinese food anywhere outside of P.F. Chang's however this place is seriously my go to for great, clean food for a very reasonable price. They always provide way more food which is great for leftovers or having lunch for the following day.. i simply place my order through Yelp and once I arrive, it's always fresh and hot! if you are in the neighborhood or passing by, I suggest you give it a try. The General Tso chicken is my favorite!!"}
{"text":"Not good. Took 50 mins for delivery. The kids \"chicken tenders\" is the chicken that is used for sweet and sour chicken. I think this batch was from this morning, hard and kinda chewy. Needless to say he didn't eat it. Pad Thai wasn't great either, a few bites was more than I wanted and it has things that aren't supposed to be in pad Thai. The other kids meal was teriyaki chicken, which was the weird reddish color chicken on a stick, we all ended up sharing that kids meal. Won't be back. (This was delivery)"}
{"text":"Terrible just flat out gross!! Ordered 8pc chicken wings and they were disgusting. The chicken tasted like it was either bad chicken or keep in poor conditions. Spring roll was gross! And the chicken on stick didn't look like any chicken I had in my life and so pink and brown on the inside?? Wasted my entire order! Never I mean never again!"}
{"text":"Really general delight?  You had some extra general chicken and some maybe? Orange shrimp I don't even know what that was....get it together."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food ever! Super healthy and always prompt with delivery... my fist choice"}
{"text":"Chinese food making Chinese people what do u expect. Yes they are always busy answering the phone taking orders. I came in with my kids. Order beef lo mein & 2 sets of wings. He called out my order to pick it up from the desk. It was in The to go boxes even though we dine in as I have told him. Yep, I was my own waiteress. I had to come back to ask for 3 plates for the kids. The other man gave me 2. Guess he wanted to save $$. OmD!  Food: the chicken was crispy and good for Chinese food. I def had better. Kids didn't complain. The lo mein here, I don't complain about. It's the type that has the pan fried taste & smell, & cooked in its own liquid & juices. Thumbs up.  I'm giving a 3. Service sucks as usual but the food is good. Btw it makes a difference if asians r serving asians... it's weird .... For them"}
{"text":"My first time ordering from here. I ordered crab rangoon, fried dumplings, and vegetable mei fun...fairly basic meal. It arrived sooner than expected. Nice and hot, but most of all, tasty.  The vegetable mei fun had a nice amount of veggies and was not overly oily as some noodle dishes can be. The fried dumplings were bigger than I'd ever seen dumplings, but tasted delicious, and the dipping sauce was perfect. Crab Rangoon was fine--nothing outstanding, but as good as many others I've tried. Not sure when I'll get to order again, since I was here visiting family, but I definitely would if I make it back for another visit.  Editing to clarify that this was an order for delivery placed through Grub Hub, so I can't speak to the dining experience in house."}
{"text":"Cheap and you get a fair deal for what you pay for.  I grew up in a place where the rice was always pork fried rice.  I come to expect the rice with any meal to need this to meet my 4 or better star standard.  This place is fast and they get the job done.  I would go back again.  I wouldn't go out if my way to get there.  It is a generic example of this type of place."}
{"text":"I like this place although I've only ordered from them twice! The food's good, they deliver (within 5-miles and a $12 minimum), a meal for one gives plenty to eat (you will have leftovers the next day unless you're an overindulgent pig, you're sharing with someone, or you just don't like leftovers). I've ordered their spring rolls and orange chicken entrees and they've always been delicious in my opinion. All orders come with a to-go menu for future reference and a fortune cookie!  This place has good food! Give 'em a try!"}
{"text":"Typical Chinese restaurant.  Stuff in brown sauce, light brown sauce, orange sauce, red sauce... ugh"}
{"text":"This is my go-to Chinese restaurant in my neighborhood. The food is always pretty good and cheap. It's your standard Chinese restaurant, all of the different entrees that I have ever ordered have been decent.  I always get a combination plate so it comes with fried rice and an egg roll. The fried rice that they serve with your main entree is ONLY rice and the egg they used when they fry it. There are no vegetables or pork or anything how most other Chinese restaurants serve their standard fried rice. It doesn't bother me, but others may be surprised by it.   You can order online now. I always worried about showing up and them \"not getting my order\" but have not had any issues with ordering online which is very convenient. It's on the Beyond Menu app or website. I usually pick it up because it's so close, but have gotten delivery a couple of times and it usually comes around 30-45 mins after ordering."}
