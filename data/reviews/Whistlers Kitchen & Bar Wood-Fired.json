{"text":"Love this place! Wonderful pizza and cheese bread! Marinara sauce is the BEST I ever had!"}
{"text":"I reserve 5 stars for the absolute best of the best so 4 stars (from me) is not a knock at all - in fact you have to stop by The Pizza Rak if you are looking for a cozy sit down pizza joint with quality fresh ingredients. My wife and I started with the Bruschetta and they hand picked fresh basil for our dish! We loved the heaping diced tomatoes on toasted italian bread with fresh basil and mozzarella cheese. Then we had the specialty Veggie Pizza (comes with caramelized onions, green and red peppers, and green and black olives) with added sausage (that is homemade in the shop) - delicious and crispy! We finished off with yummy ice cream comes (36 flavors)! The service was very friendly and we paid $15 for a regular 8 slice pizza. We highly recommend The Pizza Rak!!"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. The service was awesome as well. Had the bruschetta as well as the chicken Alfredo pizza and ice cream at the end. The ice cream is wonderful and is homemade. Honestly I think it's better than any local ice cream place.  The pizza was also perfect. This is a great place to go to grab some dinner and a beer or a glass of wine. You really can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I drive by this place every day and on the recommendation of some friends we gave it a shot. Was pleasantly surprised by the overall quality of the pizzas and other food. We were amazed that there were just a few other diners when we were there. Thursday at 6 pm. The pizza was probably the best wood fired pizza I ever had, the pepper/sausage app was the perfect amount of heat and the service great. Good beer selection!! Only things that kept me from giving it a five was this... 1) Felt prices were a tad high even for Avon. A buck or two less on some things would inspire me to expand my menu options here. And....2) The ice cream was top notch and felt the cookies and cream was much better than Mitchell's. However, my cake cone was not as fresh as I would have hoped. Still edible but not super fresh. All in all it is really worth a visit or return. My picky eater of a daughter said dad this pizza is delicious!!! Words to my ears. She also enjoyed watching her pizza cooking on the TV in the dining area. Well done and a little secret of Avon! Good job and keep it up on the quality!"}
{"text":"This would be 5 star but other things factor in here. 

First and foremost pizza there is a lot better as is any take out vs dine in. Not knocking them for that, that is my choice. 

The knock comes with the service. We have had good service dining in but when we try and tell a staff member your website is down and we couldn't review your menu then I would expect a little more class and respect. 

I just don't believe people sometimes. 

Overall, great pies, staff hit or miss sometimes."}
{"text":"This was a nice discovery while we were working our way back to Pittsburgh. Simple four cheese pizza was great. Lots of fun stretchy cheese and great thin crust. Never go to a chain when you can support a local business!"}
{"text":"Ice cream was freezer burnt and very slow service . Not the same family owned place it was a few years back."}
{"text":"Love the place.   The ambience is awesome.  The pizza is awesome.  Martha is awesome.  Love all the staff.  You can get a drink anywhere, its Martha that makes it special!"}
{"text":"On the good side the Pizza is Awesome!  There is nothing like it in the Cleveland area.  Try it one time and you'll be hooked.

On the bad side they are moving away from their ice cream business.  My two daughters and I have been going to Whisler's since they opened.  They are ALWAYS asked to go to Whister's.  We stopped in on Dec 13th to find all the kid's favorite ice cream is gone.  They have cut the flavors in half and kept what I have to assume are the traditional favorites.  Unfortunately my daughter don't want to go back.  We did find another Hershey's Ice cream vendor fairly close.  Looks like we will be heading there from now on for ice cream.  We'll keep checking to see if their favorites return every time we pick up a pizza."}
{"text":"Cozy casual place; ok service only. The pizza we got looked nothing like these photos or anything resembling wood fired crust!... Sparse toppings/  barely hot pizza .disappointing."}
{"text":"Great bruschetta.  The pizzas were some of the best I've had: fresh and bursting with flavor. Our server, Ian, was friendly and knowledgable Well worth the visit and we'll be back."}
{"text":"Just ok. Let down by the promising yelp reviews. Pizza was ok tasting but small I was able to eat a half by myself. For almost 20 bucks I want there to be leftover pizza. Mellow mushrooms pizza is much bigger and more flavorful the same price. Beer was expensive 3 bucks for a budweiser. The service should have been more organized for such a small place. Someone mentioned that they didn't know what the place was supposed to be I've cream parlor or pizza bar and that is true it's very odd. Nice decor and quaint. Most likely will go to mellow mushroom instead."}
{"text":"We stopped after the MAC baseball tourney. Great pizza. Good price point. Back to the ball park!"}
{"text":"Amazing ice cream (that's all we had) although they have pizza and other food.  Owners were awesome - very friendly and accommodating.  We would definitely come back next time we're in town."}
{"text":"An absolute gem. Took our 4 young kids here. There's a kid-friendly side and a \"grown up\" side. We sat on the former and had bruschetta and pizza. Everything was phenomenal. Our server was attentive and genuinely cheerful. Quaint ambiance. Nice local \"feel.\"  We'll be coming here a lot!"}
{"text":"Quaint historical pizza parlor. Great root beer float with homemade vanilla ice cream, yum! The margarita pizza was good. I would suggest adding extra cheese for it and I'm not a huge cheese fan, but it was a little bare of cheese.  If I lived closer I would definitely frequent this nostalgic pizza shop."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the absolute best places I have been in a long time! From the pizza, to the ice cream, to the servers and the regulars who visit here I had an amazing experience! 

I was on a double date when we decided on this restaurant because all 4 of us had never tried this place. I didn't realize that they used to only sell ice cream and only within the past couple years added the pizza to the menu. Our waitress was phenomenal by way of service and personality! She was one of the best I've ever had while dining out. She made our experience incredibly fun and besides the food she is another reason I can't wait to go back!

Our group ordered the Black & Blue Steak Pizza and the Big Red Pizza. Both were so fantastic that we didn't need any to go boxes. We all also got ice cream (of course) and were able to add that to our bills. During dinner my boyfriend attempted to kill a bee that was trying to land on our pizza and was stung in the process. The owner showed up at our table with a spoon of ice cream to cheer him up! Again, so awesome! We all got a good laugh out if that. 

They currently only sell beer and wine but will soon have a liquor license but I like this place the way it is!"}
{"text":"Just finished dinner of salad, brushetta, and pizza.  Awesome meal.  The brushetta was to die for.  The house salad dressing is excellent.  And I can't say enough good things about the pizza. We have been here 3 times in the last 2 weeks.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We always have gone for ice cream and today we went for pizza. The best pizza ever! Loved the Parmesan crust and the cheesy bread was perfect as well. We finished off with ice cream of course and plan to come back soon because our service was also exceptional! Why hadn't we come sooner?!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a while and will definitely have to bump them up the list in the future. Very good wood-fired pizza. A thinnish crust and very good cheese made for a light but satisfying dinner. As a personal preference I do like a few spots of black on the crust and a little browning on the cheese but I really have no complaints on the quality. 

The service was good and the staff friendly. I think the one girl may have been new because she was a little confused that we wanted to add take-home icecream to our dinner bill but she got help and got it right. Overall, I enjoyed the experience..

Note that they do not have hard liquor, only beer and wine."}
{"text":"Good pizza. Best part was the sauce but not enough on it for me. Crust was great too but a little burnt. Not greasy even with pepperoni which is a huge plus."}
{"text":"Great food. We've visited several times with similar experiences each time. 
Wood fired grill for the pizza and steaks. They recently added a bar with wine, beer and I believe liquor. The small menu is all excellent. We've had the salad, steaks, pasta, calimari, pizza, and all are excellent. Not a big place, but a great date atmosphere in the bar side area. It's quaint and quiet. Other side is like a pizza parlor with ice cream as well. Great spot for family with kids. Same food on both sides. 
The service is excellent and the chef will likely come out and talk with you. 
Seriously good steaks, better than other local high priced steak houses. 
I hope they don't change. Keep the menu small and stick with what they do well. 
We will continue to visit."}
{"text":"Amazing Wood-fire Pizza! Best that I've ever had."}
{"text":"Wow!  What an amazingly intimate culinary experience.  The staff was warm and helped me pick the perfect pairing of craft beer, three meat pizza and handmade ice cream.  The pizza was perfect with a handmade sausage, pepperoni and bacon that were generously portioned.  The wood firing made for a perfectly crispy crust and they let me sample a number of handmade ice cream flavors before I selected the cappuccino.   The experience was very personal and warm and is a welcome change from the sterile experience offered by so many large chains!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the Black and Blue pizza. The staff was super friendly. Overall, a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"I brought the family here for the first time to enjoy a great wood fired pizza. Right as we arrived they had a big rush of people and still were very attentive and on top of the service.  We had 3 wood fired pizzas and the kids and I cannot wait to come back again. This is a great experience and food for the whole family.  I would definitely recommend this place to family and friends. Keep up the great work whistlers. 
The van dykes."}
{"text":"This was our second time at Whistler's. We had a Caprese Salad and a make your own pizza, a mixed drink and a glass of wine. Our \"waiter\" seemed to be strangely new for a place like that on a busy night. He offered my husband a wine list while ignoring me. When I asked what drinks they offered he said beer and the 'trashy' stuff!! Ok? So I walked to the bar and looked at the drink list. I ordered a Long Island Iced Tea. He asked what kind of liquor I wanted in that!! So enough about him. Ugh. The Caprese Salad was really good despite tomatoes being out of season. The homemade mozzarella was delicious and the scoop of basil pesto they served with it was awesome. Our make your own pizza was only slightly over done but still very good. Their menu is rather limited. The place is pretty small but if you get the right server, the place is so worth a try!!"}
{"text":"Holy amazing! This place has the best wood-fired pizza I have ever had. Wait staff is very friendly too. It's a little small, with limited seating, but very cute and cozy. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking to eat in or even order out. It's perfectly cooked and not soggy like most wood-fired pizzas tend to be.  All fresh ingredients too. Very reasonably priced as well."}
{"text":"This is a cute quaint mom and pop unique kind of place that makes for a great summer spot. The pizzas were fresh and tasty but a little expensive. Inside there is an ice cream shop with homemade ice cream that includes more exotic flavor sensations like oatmeal cookie."}
{"text":"So, we frequent here regularly.  Small family run place, great atmosphere, and the pizza is uniquely delicious.  It's more pricey than your average pizza, but worth it.  Service has always been excellent."}
{"text":"Quaint little pizza place! Hope they increase the ventilation before summer really kicks in.
We had the bruschetta appetizer which was very tasty with the roasted garlic EVOO! My son ordered the chicken Parmesan and was very pleased. Wood fired pizza was good, crust was chewy( good), tasty sauce(not very spicy though), toppings were good, but not overly plentiful:(. Service was friendly and prompt.
Will probably come back if in the area, but wouldn't make a special trip."}
{"text":"4.5 stars? Really??  Ordered the clams that looked delicious on the menu, only to find out that they don't have them anymore. Looked at the steaks and realized they don't have one under $30 dollars. This isn't the kind of place you order a $30-40 steak from. When I finally settled on a salad, you had the choice between a disgusting sweet tomato sauce like dressing and ranch - not even oil and vinegar.  Couldn't wait to get out of there. Avoid this place, there are plenty of better places in Avon."}
{"text":"Expected more menu options. Calamari came out incomplete. Small portion was fairly greasy. Sauce was right out of the fridge. Tried a pizza. What else? Fair at best. We didn't,t even eat two pieces each. Pie was actually a little dough   Not enough time or bad placement in the oven.  This all t a price where you would expect better.  Not inexpensive."}
{"text":"First let me say I rarely order steak in a restaurant other than top steak restaurants; they normally can't make one as good as I can at home.  
That being said I read about the wood fired oven cooked steak at Whistlers and decided to try the strip steak.......what could go wrong.....a strip from a pizza/ice cream shop and a picky steak eater.  It was FANTASTIC!!!!
I've been to St Elmo's in Indy....I like Whistlers better, also a great salad and vegetable of the day. very impressive"}
{"text":"Really nice family owned place. It's where the locals go. 

Brruchetta and Margrhita Pizza were amazing. Service was very good. 

Homemade ice cream was a bonus! We'll be beck!!"}
{"text":"Pizza was excellent. Great homemade dressing for salad. Atmosphere very rustic. Service was excellent and quick!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Avon/Avon Lake hands down. Very kind staff as well."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Sauce is homemade and is delicious! Server was great and accommodating to our kids. Wasn't able to get ice cream, but it looked yummy and many people were there to get that."}
{"text":"Ate in for dinner on a Saturday night.  Not too busy, only a couple other tables during our visit.  Service was very good.  Chelsea (our server) was very friendly, and available for refills, etc.

Food was excellent.  We had a margeherita and a half cheese/half pep & sausage.  The margherita was fantastic.  Very curious to try some of their other pies.

The ice cream (homemade) was also great.  My wife, who is not easy to impress, said it was some of the best she ever had.  I guess it was pretty good, then.

We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza!  Great thin crust and wood fired! Excellent service and a nice outdoor seating area."}
{"text":"We ordered carryout from here on a Sunday night.  It sucked.  We ordered the 3 meat lovers pizza and the toppings were scarce and totally dry/overcooked as was the crust.  We wanted to order the calamari appetizer but the gal said their fryer was down.  What does that mean at 7:30 PM on a Sunday?  So we skipped that and ordered a house salad for $5.  According to their menu, it was supposed to have fresh mozzarella and a blend of fresh greens and spinach.  No cheese, no spinach and all brown iceberg lettuce.  We couldn't look at the salad as it was inside a brown bag stapled shut.

It didn't make sense as there was no one inside the restaurant.  Funny, the sign outside says to \"Give the independent pizza chains a chance, we will prove you right!\"  So not true here. When we stopped in to pick up our order, I looked at the pizza and it did not look good and I thought about cancelling the order based on appearances.  However, we paid for it, coming to $21.00.  The pizza was terrible and did not look like the pictures that fellow Yelpers posted. What a joke.  Will never order from here again and do not recommend. Upset that we spent the money for crappy food."}
{"text":"My fiance and I moved to Avon recently and Whistler's is right up the street from our new house.  We've passed it several times and didn't even really notice until we strolled by one day looking for unique businesses in the area.  We ended up coming back with a friend, and was one of the better restaurants we've had in quite some time!  The things that were great:

- The service.  I've worked in restaurants for many years, and recognize quality service when I see it.  And this was great, quality service!  

- The drinks.  Nothing grand, but all around good beer and soft drink selection.  

- The food.  The main part of course.  My fiance lived large and tried their filet mignon, medium rare.  She said it was one of the best she's ever had.  My friend got some kind of sea food pasta, honestly I can't recall the name, but we all tried and loved it.  I got the baked eggplant with penne pasta.  Very good stuff!  Also the salads that came with the meals were well varied with different vegetables and unique home-made dressings.  Also the bread they served was very good as well.

The food was a bit on the pricey side, so I probably won't be eating there all the time.  But all in all was a great time and I will be back for special occasions!"}
{"text":"Pizza was ok.... For $1.50 a topping that pizza should be covered with them there was barely any toppings at all....Lil ridiculous.  Service was good, waitress was nice and prompt.  Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Food  is delicious and prices are reasonable.  There is a nice variety I had the lobster pasta plan on having it for a couple meals or sharing.  Hubby had the wood fired pizza it was great ...and their house dressing (a secret recipe) is excellent.  Martha is pleasant and makes you feel very welcome we will return!"}
{"text":"Hand crafted sausage and home made mozzarella make for a great pizza.  Four cheeses in total. The mozz was quite welcome on my salad, too.

Service was friendly, though the pizza took a little more time than I would have expected for wood fired pizza.

If you're looking to spiff up your date, go to the bar side.  If you'd rather bring the kids, set right up next to the ice cream counter.  We got here just before a group with a dozen toddlers, whoo boy!

All of their ice cream is made from scratch in the store - I couldn't resist tasting a half dozen flavors, and even then, I had to get two together - oatmeal cream pie and cappuccino crunch."}
{"text":"Still my favorite place to dine in Avon! The pizza, seafood and steaks are better than the place next door and 1/2 the price. No waits usually and easy to order it to go!! 
Need a special request for and allergy or diet restriction and this place delivers!"}
{"text":"This place is very well known around town for their ice cream which I haven't tried yet but I figured I would give the pizza a taste test. 

Their pizzas are wood-fired to give the crust a nice crispy crunch. The crust is very thin making it a nice tasty meal with a little less carbs. On this particular pizza I ordered pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms and \"hot\" Hungarian banana peppers. These peppers were not spicy at all. I was looking forward to having a little bit of a kick from these peppers but they failed to satisfy in that aspect. There wasn't a lot of sauce but I'm not complaining about it because I don't think a lot of sauce has ever really suited a thin crust. As a whole I thought the pizza tasted pretty good and I would definitely order it again especially for that thin delicious wood-fired crust!"}
{"text":"Not sure about their schedule and theme. Is this a bar? A pizza place? An ice cream joint? With a 10:00 pm closing time on Friday, I'm still not sure. The pizza was fantastic, wood-fired awesomeness. The salad was made with high quality produce, the service excellent. Loved the upgrade to a large pizza at no charge. Close to the end of the night and they had the dough ready to go."}
{"text":"Omg... the best pizza ever! The owners are super sweet and I personally watched them talk to each and every table. We got a sausage onion and green pepper pizza well done. It was soooooo good! There was no leftovers between the two of us! Servers were excellent and we loved the service! Best local spot in Avon!"}
{"text":"Last night, my family tried Whistlers for the first time. We were there on a Friday night at 6:30 and pleasantly surprised to find plenty of open tables. 

The service was friendly and the pizza was very prompt, which is good with two toddlers in tow. I adored the pizza- perfect crust, house made sausage and cheese- amazing!!! 

They have a tv where you can see your pizza being cooked which was fun for the kids. We got a chocolate milkshake with our pizza- also very quick and obviously homemade!

I can't give five stars simply because we sat without drinks and with empty waters for too long. Huge pet peeve. Also, they have the iPad credit card scanner (I think it's called the Square.). This is awkward and I our case, the card wouldn't scan so it had to be entered manually. I know this is a local business, but it would go miles to have a regular credit card system. The iPad one reminds me of being at a fundraiser or a festival or something.

We will be back. again and again and again I'm sure!"}
{"text":"Just passing thru the area and decided to Yelp a Pizza sit down restaurant and came across this little treasure, first and foremost we walked in not knowing what to expect... But were immediately greeted by a very friendly and welcoming young lady her name is Allie she was our server/ bartender, all businesses should have an Allie! She was so well informed on the menu and pizzas and how delicious they were, she is so right on!  OMG!! Chef Craig knows how to prepare a wood fire pizza to perfection! Chef Craig has it down to a science his pizza crust the little bubbles on top making every bite so delicious. He was so gracious he came out to ask us how we liked the pizza, you can see he has passion for what he does, they are delicious!! We enjoyed a couple of pizzas some wine and great conversation we certainly can't wait to go back!! A Hidden Gem!!!"}
{"text":"The house dressing is very good and the pizza was excellent.  The waitress was pleasant.  I would definitely eat here again."}
