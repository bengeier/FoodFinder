{"text":"Checked this place out yesterday for the first time.

I was impressed!  Nice clean place, good music selection playing in the background.

Food came fast, and was great!

Broth could have been hotter, but by no means was it bad.  Tasted great, nice and clean, pricing is a little high but what can you expect in downtown Calgary.

I'd absolutely come here again."}
{"text":"This place is new and not too busy in the evening we went in.  Service was fantastic. And the RAMEN was delicious! Spicy flavorful broth and tender meat, we left full. And we will be back for more."}
{"text":"Cool spot, newly opened. The service was excellent.

They make their own chicken broth in-house, with no MSG. I had the Shoyu Ramen, broth was good, though perhaps slightly bitter. The chicken and pork chashu, noodles and other fixings were very good. They have several types of ramen and I can't wait to try them all. Recommended!"}
{"text":"I looked at the pictures of previous reviewers and saw the spring mix veggies on the various ramens.  However the two that we ordered didn't have any so I was quite disappointed.  The salad with bamboo shoots was just ok.. nothing special, it was mostly lettuce.  I was expecting better choice of veggies given the price.  Broth was not too bad."}
{"text":"I like Shinjuku.  The ramen is tender, the broth is piping hot, and the flavours are spicy and complicated.  No complaints.

Shinjuku is a relatively new player in Calgary's downtown ramen scene.  It has an \"Asian diner\"  feel that works.  The space is open, the staff are friendly... and who doesn't like a little hip-hop music with their noodles ... am I right? 

I ordered the seaweed salad and Shoyu Ramen with extra spice and extra pork (obviously).  The meats were tender and I enjoyed every bite.  Great end to a wonderful day.

I will be back.  Yes indeed, I will.  Much more to enjoy."}
{"text":"I love ramen especially on cold days. This place just recently open. We came on a Sunday and street parking was free. The restaurant is nicely decorated and it wasn't busy at all. Our server was attentive and friendly. 

We ordered a small sake, gyoza, shoyu ramen and the miso ramen. The house sake taste sweeter than other house sake we've tried before. The gyoza was perfectly pan fried and taste really good with soya sauce with a bit of vinegar. The ramen itself was not very flavourful. The shoyu was oily and the miso was creamy but bland. We had to add extra condiments such as garlic paste and soya sauce. The end of our meal we were treated to a complementary home made green tea ice cream it was so good. 

Overall the ramen was only okay but a bit pricy."}
{"text":"Popped in to check it out, and ended up coning back a few days later.  Tried the spicy bowl based on the waiter's recommendation, and loved it. Healthy, substantial and delicious. The pork is so tender and the noodles perfect."}
{"text":"I ordered the Shoyu Ramen and it was perfect! very good, super tender meat and the broth was great. loved the noodles too. i also ordered the takoyaki and it was delicious! i recommend this place if you're looking for a quick delicious meal. the vibe of the restaurant is really nice and chill too, super clean washrooms too!"}
{"text":"Came to Shinjuku on a Monday evening.  The place is pretty empty so the staff looked like they were a little bored.  Was greeted and told I could pick any table.  Grabbed a seat and looked over the menu.  Was in the mood for Ramen.  There are other items on the menu, but focused on Ramen.  Decided to go with the Shoyu Ramen.  They say on the menu \"Thick Noodles\"  I'm not sure what the thin noodles would be but the thick noodles are basically the regular sized ramen noodles.  

The Ramen was delivered in no time and holy moly... Volcano hot !  
The broth had good flavour and there was a generous portion of \"Thick\" noodles along with a slice of chicken and pork.  The requisite egg as well as bamboo shoots, green onion and nori.  The portion size is exactly what you'd expect to get at a Ramen joint.  

Overall, The ramen was good, but not the best I've ever had.  Service was very good and the servers were very attentive (keeping in mind there was myself and one other couple).  There are a plethora of TVs around tuned to various sports games.  The ramen is solid and the service was very good... I'll definitely go back, and try some of the other menu items."}
{"text":"My bus stop is right in front of Shinjuku and I've been eagerly waiting for them to open for months and I wasn't disappointed. Beautiful decor, attentive staff and the ramen broth is possibly the best I've had (I had the Shio ramen and I can't wait to try everything else they offer)."}
{"text":"Downtown ramen bar in Calgary. Authentic ingredients. Nice side dishes especially tako wasabi."}
{"text":"So far I'm impressed with this place. They make their chicken based stock msg free and they have a rice noodle option for people avoiding wheat. The prices and portions are decent and the staff are friendly. My only complaint is that the broth could use a little bit depth of flavour and both times I've been there the broth wasn't very hot. Easy problems to fix. The broth was actually more flavorful on the second visit so maybe consistency is the only problem."}
