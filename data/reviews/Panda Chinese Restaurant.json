{"text":"Had a rare only person in the house night, so I decided to treat myself.     I have passed by the Panda for years, and have always wanted to stop by, but my wife is very picky about Chinese food.   With only me, I had the perfect opportunity.  I stopped in on the way home on Tuesday, July 3rd, to order and go.   Entered, and found really nothing to write home about the interior decor.  But I am of the mindset that if the decor is not great, the food usually is.  (long experiences with Mexican restaurants in the west)  There were several people in the front area, either waiting for their food or waiting to order.  But nobody sitting down.  It was early in the evening, though.  I love General Tso's chicken, and most of the time, it is not that spicy, to appeal to a wider audience.   I ordered the dinner special, which came with fried rice and an egg roll.   I could see thru to the kitchen behind the counter, and was able to watch as my food was prepared.  It came quickly, and I took it home.  As I was leaving, there were more people coming in.  I got home and grabbed a beer, and got into my order.  And the General Tso's was spicy!!!  The way it should be!!  It was a generous portion, and the fried rice was flavorful.  The egg roll, well it was an egg roll, but I love egg rolls as well!  Be mindful, this was just a review of one dish.  I do have to go back and try more!"}
{"text":"Have been a regular for some time. Last two years have noticed quality of food sadly going down. The combination plate sweet and sour chicken used to be cooked just right with plenty of meaty pieces. Couple of years ago more orders were found to be overcooked and less meaty. I started calling in orders with instructions to lightly cook. This seemed to work most of the time, but not always and the receiver of the order seemed nice and willing. This Friday night (1-15-16) I placed my phone order, again requesting light cooking of chicken. I was curtly told that all of their chicken was cooked the same way. I informed the lady that I had had a problem of over cooking in the past. I brought my order home, found three pieces of chicken, overcooked. The rest of the order was crackling greasy air, crunchy hard. Sorry Panda; this loyal customer has had enough. I'm WALKING!     LMM"}
{"text":"Best sesame chicken in the world. I travel all the time for work and try lots of Chinese  joints but nothing comes close to this place. Best take out Chinese food hands down that I have ever had."}
{"text":"This is our go-to Chinese. When I'm in a hurry, I'll grab food from the buffet to go, otherwise, their won ton soup or the peanut chicken are really worth waiting for.  The staff are friendly, and quick to remember the regulars. I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"It was ok, nothing special though. They do have quite a few chicken dishes to choose from and one was growing on me. I liked that they offered icecream for dessert. We went for lunch and the price is reasonable."}
{"text":"Staff made you feel as if they were doing you a favor by waiting on you. Owner on the phone and didn't even acknowledge the customer.  Food was awful. Will never go back"}
{"text":"It is too bad I can't give this zero stars.  Eat at your own risk!  I had Kung Pao Chicken and got really bad food poisoning.   The chicken was all dark meat and tasted aweful. I will never go back here again."}
{"text":"4/13/17: I called in a to-go order for Singapore Mei Fun.  At the cost of over $10.50 (including tax), I was totally livid after I got home and found that I had paid that much $$ only to have a full container of mostly noodles. There couldn't have been any more than 3-4 shrimp, very little chicken, beef or pork, and practically no veggies to speak of.  NEVER. EVER. AGAIN."}
{"text":"Stop here for lunch hoping it would be a bit better quality of food since the price is higher then the other buffet i visited.  It was not very busy, much smaller place only 3 short buffet lines of food.  Most of the food trays were empty some were basically empty and what was in them looked old and dried out. What i did try tasted the same as any other chinese buffet i have been to.  I was there for about 45 min and only one thing was refilled, service was horrible.  Walked in not really greeted just told to sit where ever, got some food sat back down and was asked what i wanted to drink 1min later which was water oh and that was the last time i saw any staff never got a refill plates never cleared.  It would have been 1 star but they did have a softserve icecream machine! On that note i will not be returning to this place or recommending it."}
{"text":"Apparently Pandas are plentiful in the Cleveland, Panda BUFFETS that is:)   This smaller version of Panda Buffet is up in Willoughby,  just off the main drag of Euclid Avenue. it's a nice little place where the food is good, plentiful and fresh and staff are very nice and always on point to make sure you glass is full and your needs are tended to. I don't know if the place is good for big groups, but if you're interested in stopping off before a movie at the local theater, or catching a quick and healthy bite before going shopping, I suggest the Panda. Their prices are good and they won't empty your wallet while you fill up your \"tank\";)  So, stop by the Panda Buffet, it \"bears\" up very well against the competition:)"}
{"text":"A nice little buffet that offers some different dishes than others Chinese restaurants. Super friendly staff. But one area where this little place excels is the offer delivery."}
{"text":"Fully legit American Chinese food, and the service is typically excellent.  And hello, ice cream bar!  Food is great, prices are right on target.  Order or visit with confidence."}
{"text":"If you can get past the plastic utensils and styrofoam plates and plastic to go containers for bowls than this is your place. The rude and curt to the point wait staff are at the counter to serve you a order with no extra conversations-    If nonexistent pleastries of welcome, thank you and come back soon don't bother you and the hole in the wall decor doesn't bother you than this is your joint!  The food is hot and eh ... well etable..   I would not recommend this rude hole in the wall to anyone ... Frozen meals from any grocery store would be a better decision."}
{"text":"Panda Panda Panda Panda Pan-Pan-DA! (sorry, now that Deerhoof song is in my head)  Sort of in a hurry for food last night because my child does not yet understand the meaning of waiting and we were in the area. So.... Panda Buffet it was.   I'm pretty sure you can order from a menu OR get buffet. We opted for the buffet (horrifying, I know) because it was faster and child of mine was wasting away to nothing.  I would say, next time I'll order from the menu because the buffet was alllll kinds of scary. It might be good if you're brave and if you know how to not vomit or spit out food when you get something gross or questionable. The buffet had tons of options and some of the stuff was pretty good. Others...  well, let's just say don't eat the wonton or potstickers. Both had mystery meat in them. Any seafood they offered was much less than fresh. I steered clear of that because I was not in the mood to be hooked up to IV fluids.   Service was good. The girls that work there are nice. They love babies and didn't give me the stink-eye when my kid was being a bit noisy.   I would probably go back because I'm adventurous and because the few things that were actually edible on the buffet were totally worth the 9 bucks for all you can eat. Plus there was ice cream."}
{"text":"Me and my boys stopped by for lunch after seeing Star Wars! Excellent movie but that's where excellent stopped. Food seemed to be cooked by college dorm room freshman, and the place was greasy, slipped on the floor, in several spots. Cold wonton soup and noodles that my 7 year old said tasted like, \"they pooped in the dumpling\". I did not go up for seconds. The kids were full after the poop dumplings and a sundae that came from the machine in a Frosty consistency. Normally we compete who went up the most times. When we got home, my son tossed up the food an hour later in our newly acquired home, just in time for the wife coming and yelling at me for taking them to a dive. I was punished by cleaning up the slop.    2 stars-1 for cheap prices and 1 for honesty in presentation."}
{"text":"I was in the area craving Asian noodles/rice.  I was going to try Thai Orchid in Mentor, but they were closed for the weekend, due to a family reunion.  I order pizza from Jet's, which is next door to the Panda Chinese restaurant, all the time, but had never tried this restaurant before.  I stopped in on a Sunday, and was a little bit hesitant, because the restaurant was relatively empty.  I'm not a big fan of buffet style restaurants, but was hungry and tired.  I was pleasantly surprised that the food looked fresh, and wasn't dried out from sitting out too long (except for the sushi and cheesecake, neither was chilled properly.....I'll pass!).   I had a number of routine Asian buffet dishes that all in all were pretty decent.   There was plenty of fresh fruit for dessert.  As I mentioned, this was just ok, I'll probably visit again at some point."}
{"text":"I can't believe I never wrote a review for this place before.  I have lived here for just over a year now, and this place is the ONLY Chinese food place (that delivers) that I like.  They are sometimes busy, but always polite.  I know our past orders pop up on the screen when we give our phone number, but they are so used to us that if we ask to change things up and ask her to recommend something, she is spot on :)  The food is great, we never ever had any issues with taste, quality or meager servings.  If we ask for things a certain way, they always remember.  They are USUALLY very quick on delivery too.  Sometimes the containers leak which can be messy, but we have never had a meal spoiled because of it.  Prices are very good and you can get a real good amount of food for the dollar."}
{"text":"Went with my girlfriends and we really enjoyed a nice variety of American Chinese food. Nice clean buffet with soft serve ice cream lol...Really liked the peanut chicken and coconut shrimp. Everything was delicious. I had ice cream would of rather had fruit but looked a little, well to best describe not fresh as could of been...but we did go late. All in all very nice place to eat."}
{"text":"This was always my go-to Chinese restaurant when I lived in Cleveland and when I had to come into town for business this past week I insisted we come here. The food is always good, the service is always friendly and efficient and it's cheap."}
{"text":"Good Chinese takeout. Looked for a local place and this one doesn't disappoint. They are fast, affordable, convenient, and the service is good. I would recommend."}
{"text":"I have had both their buffet and their takeout over the years and I just have to say NOT to judge their food based on the buffet's quality. While it's decently good and definitely satisfies the taste for Chinese food, their takeout is SO much better by a long shot. The only other drawback to this place is the front desk customer service. There's a nice girl that works there and handles most of the transactions, but who I assume is the owner can seem a bit overwhelmed at times and it can come off as rude when she's speaking with you. With all of that aside, the food is always freshly made, super hot when you receive it, the flavors are spot on, and the prices seem decently fair. Definitely my go-to place for Chinese takeout in the area!"}
{"text":"It's fast, it's cheap. The work crews seem to love it here for lunch -- but as a result there's often mud tracked in from all the work boots. I've only ever gotten the Honey Chicken, and it's perfectly acceptable. A bit more attention to cleaning, presentation (it's all styrofoam containers and plastic forks even when eating in), and service with a smile would go a long way."}
{"text":"This place has the look and feel of the standard, small, family-owned Chinese restaurant (with the light-up grid menu hanging above, one small counter dead center in the room when you walk in, booths along the wall to your left, etc.).  The staff was quite friendly when I walked in and ordered.  As far as the food goes, it was mostly fine. HUGE portions, so if you're a volume eater and crave Chinese food, go for it.  However, from experience ordering a chicken dish from this place, they load it with WAY more vegetables than meat, which was somewhat disappointing.  It's still pretty decent Chinese food.  Their medium-sized portions of noodles and such are enough to last you the day."}
{"text":"Family business. Excellent food and value. Great lunch deals. They will spice up anything you want. Very fresh and quick."}
{"text":"Not recommended. Szechuan beef tasted like ketchup. Spring roll spongy and tasted bad. Pork fried rice is OK.  My daughter likes the Sesame Chicken but too sweet for my taste."}
{"text":"Atmosphere aside, the food here was good. Particularly the general tso chicken. It was crispy not soggy like some places. It looks like your typical take out chinese joint so our expectations were not high to begin with but we enjoyed the food and would definitely go back."}
{"text":"This is your average Chinese buffet.  Lunch was $6.49 and had what most basic buffets would have. The only thing missing was a salad bar, because I like to start with a salad to offset the damage to be done afterwards.  But all the food I had was good.    Bottom line, if you want a Chinese buffet for cheap, come here."}
{"text":"Food was terrible and woman who rang me up was soooooo rude. Chicken chewy and rubbery. Will never go back! Kami so much better!"}
{"text":"Good place to order take out from.  Restaurant is located at the corner of 84 and Providence Rd in the Harris Teeter Shopping Center.    Parking was not an issue at all.  Easy to park close to the door.   We called ahead and the order was ready 10 minutes later.  Pick up was easy.    Portions were good, prices were fair.    I had the honey chicken, fried rice and egg roll.  Fried rice was good!  Honey chicken had a bit too much honey on it.  Plentiful chicken portion.  Egg roll was solid.  I was starving when I started eating, and still had 1/4 of my food left over, I was stuffed!   Everyone is our family was satisfied with their selection.    There are plenty of tables to eat at this location, although no one was eating there when we picked up our dinner."}
{"text":"Just OK Chinese food.  A cut below most take out places and not nearly the best buffet in the area.  I can't recommend it."}
{"text":"This is my wife's favorite Chinese in the world. I don't get it, but she's swears by the sweet and sour tofu. We used to get it when we lived by 1-90 and route 91. Now i live by 1-90 and west 150th. I must have some strange attraction to the interstate.  We had said tofu Saturday and it was exactly the same. Crispy and not soggy. The egg roll is actually a spring roll. I hate when you order a spring roll and they give you a disgusting greasy egg roll. This place is the opposite. You never know which you'll get depending on the establishment.   Anyhow, for making my wife so very happy, this place gets high marks. It's also across from Lake West hospital. If you are staying there for any reason, you can have Chinese for your last meal."}
{"text":"I have no problem with cheap Chinese food.  It's usually pretty easy to deep fry something and put some sauce on it.  Somehow, this place screws it up.  My wife and I both got the buffet.  It was about 6:30, so prime dinner time, the food should be getting turned over pretty quick.  Not the case here.  I started with some crab rangoon, an egg roll, potstickers, and the wonton soup.  For some reason the \"soup\" was just a broth and the wontons were on a separate warmer.  The broth was fine, but the wontons were dried out, and the meat inside was pretty nasty.  The egg roll was very bad as well, fried on the outside but not cooked all the way through.  I had one bite of potstickers and again couldn't deal with whatever type of meat was inside of it.  They tasted like they had been there for 2 or 3 days.  The crab rangoon was pretty good, but it's hard to screw up crab meat and cream cheese.  I tried some bacon-wrapped crab (pretty sure it was imitation crab, but whatever), a spare rib, and the General Tso's chicken (since it's the only thing I saw brought out fresh from the kitchen while I was there).  None of it had any real flavor.  No spice at all to the chicken, and it's pretty clear that the ribs and the bacon/crab combo had been sitting for some time.  Chewy and flavorless.  My wife got the chicken and broccoli which she said was OK, but her chicken and mushrooms tasted more like salt than anything else.  I'm used to going to a Chinese buffet and having the desserts be pre-package stuff you can buy at Sams Club.  This is the first Chinese buffet I've been to where it seemed like all of the food was stuff you could buy at a discount store and reheat at home.  The problem is they didn't even do the reheating right.  The best part of my meal was the tea, and honestly even that wasn't good, just drinkable.  The worst part of it was that we went the day before Thanksgiving, and their food left me without an appetite for the next day.  I don't head out to this side of town very often, but if I could save someone else from eating at this awful restaurant I'll consider it a service."}
