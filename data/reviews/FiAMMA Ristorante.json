{"text":"Came here about a year ago with a group of 4, it's an a-ok Italian place. Had pizza and pasta, dessert and drinks. All around an ok experience. What initially drew me to this place was their huge pizza oven, if you're willing to invest in a pizza oven like that I'm willing to invest in you and try a place out. Servers were good and food didn't take too long to come out."}
{"text":"Went here with some colleagues and I thought it was OK. It wasn't incredible but it wasn't bad either.  i had the Insalata con Pecorino for a starter - lettuce, goat cheese, candied pumpkin seeds and cranberries. This was delicious! I'm a sucker for all of those ingredients individually so imagine them all put together - mmm!  For the main, I had the Fusilli con Pollo - chicken, sundried tomatoes, and spinach in a tomato cream sauce. Again, loved all the ingredients, and absolutely loved the pasta.  The biggest disappointment for me was the tiramisu. It was unflavoured mush. Usually at an Italian restaurant, tiramisu is my go-to dessert since it's usually what they do best, but this was definitely an exception. I couldn't taste any coffee or really anything at all.   Otherwise, this place is reasonably priced and quite a nice ambiance if you're looking to go somewhere decent with your colleagues. I probably wouldn't go out of my way for it though."}
{"text":"Awful experience. Food was very good but service sucked. We went with a group of co-workers. Firstly the waiter was not pleasant who kept asking whether we wanted appetizers. We kept saying 'no' but somehow dishes of calamaris and bruschetta came out. As with any group, you don't know who ordered what to share so we ate them. At the end, the bill included $84 worth of food that no one ordered. I just think it's a sleezy way to take advantage of a group who simply want to get together for a nice meal."}
{"text":"Interior decor is dark in old 80's mob flick but I guess it has its charms if you are out for a night with the wife.   The food is pretty good. I had a pizza and salad and was satisfied with both. The pizza is wood oven thin crust and a good version of it!   I also tried the gnocchi which was extremely heavy and not as good as the pizza.   Prices are fairly reasonable though perhaps slightly on the high side for its location.  Service is friendly and attentive. All in all not a bad spot close to the airport."}
{"text":"We came here one day for a team lunch and had reserved a table for 5. We waited around 15 minutes in line and when it was finally our turn, they told us that they were setting up the table. 15 minutes past, still no table. My colleague asked the host and he said he remembers, for 5. Half an hour past, still no table. The host was walking around looking very confused and lost. My team leaves frustrated and hungry after 45 minutes of waiting. People here clearly don't even know what they're doing. Having your customers wait like that is extremely unacceptable."}
{"text":"Excellent classic Italian food with friendly and polite service.  This is a definite restaurant I will return to on another trip to Canada.  The entire menu is a la carte making it for a difficult selection, but I finally decided on a pasta dish that was clearly a work of art and tasted the same with a great amount of sauce that even after finishing all the pasta, I needed to use a spoon and finish the sauce it was so good.  Being from the US the only item preventing 4 stars was some of the assumptions the wait staff took, like the Oil for the bread and the charging for each refill of soda (Pop as they call it here).  The later of these I would have like to know before offering a refill to me.  But that is a lesson learned as I travel..."}
{"text":"I think it's a standard Italian restaurant with all you would expect in the menu. I have been here on two occasions and had pasta which tasted fine. The staff is very friendly and has a good wine selection options.  I would not come here unless I have no other options (and there are limited fine dining restaurants in the area)"}
{"text":"Summary: Great pizza but cruddy service  With great pizza, decent pasta and other entrees for $15-20, Fiamma is classier lunch option for those looking for a sit down environment with good ambiance.  If you do come here, get the pizza, it's superb.  But... Tony, Tony, Tony... sigh.  What can I say, our waiter, Tony, completely destroyed our experience here.  Tony, take a page from Toni, Tony, Tone; service is about \"Whatever you want\" and not pissing off your patrons (to be blunt).   Tony is rude, overcharged on our bill and deceived us (or simply didn't inform us) with how items would be charged on our bill.    I'd give Fiamma 4 stars if it weren't for Tony, he has just got to go."}
{"text":"Why would they think splitting pizza toppings into four separate quadrants would be a good idea (see my Yelp picture)? Crust was thin but not as crisp as I'd like it. Mickele's (just down the street from Fiamma) had better pizza but Google says it's permanently closed. Veal parmigiana was good.  Place has a more upscale feel - a good lunch spot for a business lunch - not many upscale places in this area to choose from."}
{"text":"OK. To be honest, the food here is good. I would rate it a solid 4, so why the 3 then you ask?? Well, the one waiter I had was TERRIBLE.  I started with some wine and Italian soda, because it's a nice hot evening...  I decided to start with the cheese plate (I know but I can't have it as dessert, I just CAN'T DO IT!!!) and a side salad. The salad was amazing but it was the cheese platter that really was the start of a bizarre experience...  First, the waiter comes by and brings the platter. He walks away. I ask him to come back to tell me what kind of cheeses were on my plate. He looked at me like I had asked him to lick my face. He looks at the plate and goes, \"that one is spicy\" yes, the flakes of red pigments kind of gave that away. \"... and this one is yellow.\" WHAT?! What the heck is yellow cheese? Is that like yellow snow? In which case, no thanks, I don't want to eat pee?! I wanted to ask what the third one was but at this point my friend and I were in disbelief... So I quickly changed topics and asked for some sharing plates, he takes the bread plates from the seating next to us and puts them down... I go, \"umm, bigger????\" He rolls his eyes at me and leaves. He does come back with *slightly* bigger plates. So in the end, I asked another waiter and got a better response... but what shocked me was that as part of the cheese plate, I received a chuck of Parmesan. Did they just take it out of their cheese grater?! That was super weird.  Otherwise, had a great shrimp spaghetti but was surprised that the tomato sauce was oil based as opposed to tomato based. And the Tosca chicken pizza. That's a pretty good pizza. They have the large wooden pizza stoves.  My suggestion to the restaurant owners, educate your staff... I hate when staff don't know the food... oh and Tabasco! I should have carried some with me because hot oil and chilli flakes just don't do it for me."}
{"text":"So I have passed this place many times and I am at the Tim Horton's next door regularly.  Every time I walk outside all I can smell is the wood burning oven and the pizza.  Everyone rants and raves that they have the best wood oven pizza.  I am Italian and have tried my fair share of Wood oven pizza.  After hearing all these comments I figured that seeing how hard it is to find a good real Italian pizza I MUST try it.  The server was very forgetful and somewhat sarcastic.  Kind of a turn off to begin with.  I was with a group and we ordered a few apps which were very good ill give the apps 4 stars.  Lets get to the pizza.  I was so excited only to be LET DOWN.  The pizza has NO taste what so ever.  I felt like I was eating plain dough.  Lacking salt.  Toppings had no taste.  I can rant and rave all day but I think you get the point.  My girlfriend got the gnocchi which were very very good ill give them 5 stars.  Should have got the gnocchi.  Everyone that ordered something other then pizza was happy  I will go back but will NOT be getting the pizza.  Weather or not I return after that will be determined after my second visit.  Be on the look out for my review on my second visit :)"}
{"text":"Good Italian food. Awful service.  First time ever I had a waiter attempt to clear the table while I was still eating.  This has happened on occasion when I'm eating with others and they finish eating before me. I don't agree with it, but understand that. In this instance I was eating alone. Fork literally in my mouth as he attempts to clear.   I should have known service would be lacking when I arrived and stood at the hostess station for 10 minutes waiting for someone to notice I needed to be seated. The bartender was fiddling with ice at his empty bar that faced me and the hostess station. I finally went up to him and asked if I should just sit anywhere or wait to be seated. His response, \"What do you mean?\" didn't instill confidence.   Anytime I wanted something I had to loudly say, \"excuse me, could I ... place my order, get some water, order some wine\", etc. as he walked by. Lest you think he was overwhelmed there were only 4 tables with a total of 6 people in the whole restaurant (2 doubles and 2 singles). He wasn't any better with anyone else as everyone seemed unhappy with something.   Again, the food was good, but I won't be going back due to the service."}
{"text":"Great ambient tranquil  Supreme lamb is  excellent pizza   Service very good we'll come back  thank you"}
{"text":"I came with coworkers for lunch and it was a busy Friday afternoon. We had reservations so we did not have to wait. We were served promptly and got our orders of sparking water quickly. We ordered two appetizers, bruchetta and fried calamari to share between the 7 of us and the dishes were served quickly as well.  I ordered the wild boar ragu while my coworkers ordered a variety of pasta and pizza. The portion sizes were very generous. I also wanted to note that the pizza is made in a wood fire oven which is super authentic and the pizza looked really good. My pasta was a good size but the flavour was very underwhelming. It was bland and pretty disappointing in taste. My coworkers enjoyed their meals and our service was quick and good so no complaints there.  The restaurant's exterior is quite deceiving as the interior is nice and fancy. The location is in a plaza that you would not expect to have a so-called fancy Italian restaurant. This place would be good  to host groups and client meetings; however not my recommended restaurant of choice for yummy pasta!"}
{"text":"The Yelp reviews on this place (which aren't many) are very mixed; people either hated or loved this place.  Maybe they didn't order something they liked or the service wasn't great.    I was traveling in Toronto on business and didn't want to eat \"complimentary\" hotel food (although I did swipe a cookie!).  We heard about this place from a co-worker and decided to dine here for the night (it was literally 2 minutes down the road from our hotel).    It's located in a strip mall, right across the parking lot from a Tim Horton's (which we hit right after dinner for a coffee).  It has a dark setting right when you walk in, full service bar on the right with a circular wine rack in the middle of the dining room.  We didn't have to wait and were seated immediately.  I ordered the fried calamari and black shrimp with pasta (olive oil and black olives, the dish had a fancy name that I don't remember).  The shrimp was good, cooked just right and nestled into a pile of thin pasta.  The dish was mixed with black olives, dried tomatoes and a small dab of olive oil.  Mixed well and presented in a classic deep bowl, wide lip style.  Good food for a decent price ($18 for my dish, which I believe isn't bad for Toronto).  If you're in the Mississauga area looking for a decent place to eat, navigate your way to Fiamma.  *I gave 3 stars since this was my first time and I'm not familiar with the Toronto food scene.  In my mind, the food was decent at a fair price; but it didn't wow me compared to what I've had before.*"}
{"text":"The place is very nice. Good ambiance. Had a taste for good pizza like back home Chicago. Not Boston Pizza. The price for pizza at Boston Pizza is ridiculous and it's not even authentic. The prices here are fair and worth it. Can't wait to go there again and try a different dish. Oh did I mention the service there is good."}
{"text":"Over all an ok experience. Calamari were hard & nit very tasty. The cold cut plate was ok. Penne alla vodka was good & i really enjoyed the Fiamma wood oven pizza, Italian sausages with goat cheese & Aragula. I enjoyed the food, maybe I'll be back### Note: customer service was not the best. I had to repeat what I was ordering twice. Manners were not impressive##"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. I booked a reservation on Saturday for a group of 9 for my birthday dinner weeks in advance. 3 days before the reservation I got a call from the restaurant saying they were actually closed for the entire long weekend even though the holiday, family day, was on Monday. After confirming with multiple people so far in advance I now have to scramble and attempt to get another reservation a few days before the event. I won't be returning to fiamma again."}
{"text":"My clients took me to this restaurant as a way of saying thank you for the great year. Coming in I had no idea of what to expect considering it is Italian.   The moment you step in you are greeted with nice people and brought to your seat. They offer a nice menu overall and wine at start. I had the halibut and bass with rice and veggies. It was nice and tasty. Considering it was lunch , the amount of people in where more than usual. The prices are good. Little bit high but that's what you would expect at an upscaled restaurant. The environment was great, there were Christmas trees and music playing in the background.  The only thing I didn't like was that it was too dark for my liking.   Overall good experience!"}
{"text":"Don't let the location fool you!  Such great decor, awesome wine list, great food and 5 star service.  Lobster ravioli was the best-lobster filled pockets over a light lemon herb sauce.  5 star experience for great price-plus the service was amazing, thank you Larry!!!!!"}
{"text":"I came here for a work function on a weekday for lunch. The interior of this restaurant is dim and quite fancy feeling (bad for itis that came thereafter!). Definitely more of a classier vibe.  Our server was very attentive and service was always present. We were given bread (with olive oil & vinegar) to start.  I ordered the pan seared crusted sesame fresh Atlantic salmon, pineapple strawberry salsa ($27), which came with rice and veggies. For the price, I had expected much, much more (in terms of taste and portions). For such an expensive dish, I would've expected the presentation to be a little better (see picture, plating looked like that of a self-serve hot plate at Longos lol).  Finished my meal off with a cappuccino that was perfectly light and frothy.  Next time, I'll definitely be sticking to classic Italian dishes such as pizza or pasta..they looked pretty amazing."}
{"text":"This is an above average italian restaurant. Unfortunately no one at our table had the pizza.. we were in the mood for pasta! So anyway we had between us the charcuterie, calamari, and bruschetta pizza for appetizer -- nothing to complain about here. The mains were amazing and raised the bar from the apps; fresh pasta and enough seasoning on everything. Had lovely Aranciata and Limonata to complement our meals.  Tip: they have gluten-free pasta but only in penne :)"}
{"text":"Great place.   We had a group dinner for an intimate 24 people.   We got to try quite a bit of the menu.   The pizza was excellent (we tried several versions).  Both our dinners tasted great and very attractive.   They had a fun bar crowd also.   Nice big place with nice atmosphere.  Wait staff was very attentive."}
{"text":"I was concerned with the location but the food was amazing. Service was also on point.  I had the special, Chilean sea bass, and it melted in your mouth.  Grilled Octopus was also a delicious app. If your in the area and like Italian you must check it out for dinner."}
{"text":"Went with the family for a special dinner. Our first time here. The place looked nice and were promptly seated. Our server was very nice. My first negative is they have no childrens menu and observing the crowd there was more than enough to warrant one. They did put together a dish for her but charged:  Noodles: $9.00 Sauce: $2.00 Shrimp (5 of them): $15.00 Total: $26.00 for a child's meal  This is a total rip off. I had to bolognese pasta. Very expensive for not very much food (half the portion of other restaurants I've been too). My wife had the tenderloin and again not very much food and was well done instead of the medium she ordered. The potatoes seemed like they were made with water and had no taste at all. I would say the desserts were the best part of the meal but again, the portions were super small for a high price of $9.00 each (even for my daughters ice cream). We gave this place a try but don't think we will be back."}
{"text":"I came here for a business lunch recently, and was impressed with the decor and ambiance the second I walked in. Beautifully decorated, dimly lit, I felt like I was walking into a very classy place. I wondered what the prices would be like, seeing as it felt very fancy - but to my surprise, they were incredibly reasonable. My 7oz Angus striploin was $21, and most dishes were between the $15-$25 range I would say.  My steak was cooked how I requested, and the accompanying vegetables were very nice. My colleagues ordered various pasta dishes which looked to me like they used fresh pasta - bonus points (or maybe I've just seen too many episodes of Kitchen Nighmares and fresh pasta is common?). Definitely a great spot for a business lunch, not too many options in the area. Parking lot is a bit of a nightmare but just park in the first spot you find and walk!"}
{"text":"This is one of the few restaurants in the immediate area that has a bit more high end ambience.  The prices reflect that a bit but not too bad.  Great for corporate meals or entertaining clients."}
{"text":"Inexpensive \"fine\" dining in the far away place of Etobicoke. Downtowners won't find it easy to find. This is a good place to take your clients, treat them with decent meal without breaking your bank account.   According to my wine lover friends, wine list is decent (I don't drink).   I had risotto and I'm not a fan. Uhmmm, I did not like it. I came here twice and will not come back to take my friends out. But will be with co workers where the setting is not so intimate and the conversation is \"lighter\"."}
{"text":"I'm yelping for the Woodbridge location. Decor in the ristorante is nice, and service is adequate. In terms of food I ordered a Cesar salad and noticed that the produce was not fresh. I'm speculating but from my understanding the restaurant is fairly new and not a lot of business goes in and out, so they must be reserving on things like lettuce.    I also ordered a penne a la vodka. I found it to be too creamy and was unable to finish my meal. My experience here was just ok. I wonder how the restaurant is in the Toronto location  3 days later, I've been experiencing stomach pain since my visit there. I don't believe it is food poisoning but the heavy cream associated with the pasta. It's too bad, but I've decided to never go there again"}
{"text":"We were staying at the Quality Hotel near the airport as our connecting flight to Ottawa was the next morning.  We decided to go to Fiamma as one of our friends had eaten their before.  It was a great atmosphere, dim lit, and had nice music.  We were seated right away however our server seemed busy, distracted and might have presumed that we weren't high class enough to tip him as much as the other customers he was serving.  The food however made up for the lack of service - We ordered Caesar salad's, bruschetta and I had the caprese and they were all fabulous.  I ordered the pappadella pasta with prosciutto, crimini mushrooms and rapini in a roasted garlic olive oil sauce topped with shaved parmesan.  It was to die for!  If I'm ever in the area again, I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Been going to this place for a few years now, it used to have interesting owners to put it lightly (I'd rather not get wacked ;) . The Pizza is incredible, my favourite dish out of this place for sure. Pasta is quite good as well, although i prefer Lenny's out in Etobicoke. Service is usually good, but the last few times i went the waiting was long, and the server was rude to us. She would tell us she was sorry out of obligation, you can tell when people just say words for the sake of saying them. I'd go back if i wasn't in a rush to go somewhere. The atmosphere is nicely dim lit great for dates."}
{"text":"This is one of the restaurants I frequent with my customers when i am in Mississauga. The place is huge, so its never a problem finding a table. It does get packed especially during lunch and dinner times...so making reservations is always a good idea. But last few times we have landed here at the last minute and the host always accommodates us and finds a table for us before the rush starts.  Menu is standard. Salads, Pizza, Pasta. They do run specials on a daily basis, always worth giving it a try. Food is good but nothing to rave about. Service is attentive. They have good selection of wine and will recommend based on your needs."}
{"text":"Located in a strip mall with several other restaurants, my expectations were not much higher than that- a strip mall reataurant. But! I was pleasantly surprised! From the outside the location gives no indication of the beautiful decor inside. The restaurant was slightly modern, but still cozy which is great for dining italian. It was also much larger than I expected. The menu is organized by traditional Italian courses, which I can find a little overwhelming. But I also have a hard time choosing when there are too many choices. I went with the evening's special which was halibut, which was quite good. For me the draw back of the restaurant is the service. We were slow to be greeted, and did not receive much attention or guidance. I also noted the large amount of staff, which seemed to be a quite a bit more than necessary."}
{"text":"Rumour has it this place is owned by the Mafia. Either way it's fantastic. The decor is dark and romantic and high class. The food is impeccable; I don't think there is anything bad on the menu.   I had the Penne alla Vodka. What can I say, a creamy vodka sauce tossed with panchetta, awesome. The caesar salad I had to start with was really well done too. Not overly sauced, not too garlicky, and lots of large flakes of parmigano reggiano.   This is a great place to take a date or to impress a client for lunch."}
{"text":"The décor is really nice and looks elegant.  The food was just okay..  I guess the restaurant just caters to regulars because individuals in the group I was with received great attention.  I was the newcomer and generally ignored.  That left a negative impression.  The interesting thing is that I travelled to the States and ate in a restaurant with the exact same menu.  I guess maybe the restaurant is part of a bigger chain with different names in different locations?  The food and service was better in the US location.  I had the fish in the Etobicoke location and it was bland.  I had the Caesar Salad in the US from the same menu and it was fantastic."}
{"text":"The patio here is awesome - the high fence makes it feel secluded and you forget you're even in Mississauga. But that's it's only redeeming factor. I found my pizza crust to be super bland and in need of a good pinch (or twenty) of salt. Also the toppings were really sparse! I ordered the Primavera pizza and expected it to be piled with grilled eggplant, zucchini, and mushrooms, but there were maybe 2-3 small pieces of each on the entire pizza. I might come back here again and try the pasta, but I won't be getting the pizza again."}
{"text":"Food was fresh, tasty and very impressed.  Service a bit slow."}
{"text":"I first learned of the restaurant via Yelp. I travel extensively and use Yelp all the time. I've been to this restaurant on nearly every visit to Mississauga and has yet to disappoint."}
{"text":"I have tried to like this place but the dark interior and high prices can't make the pasta taste any better.  I am frequently disappointed when I come here, though I do enjoy that there is a wide selection of dishes, and a large wine list."}
{"text":"Waiter was rude. They will charge you for each drink and not tell you that there are no refills. Food was cold and undercooked. 30 dollars later for a plate of cold pasta and a diet coke, I will not be returning."}
