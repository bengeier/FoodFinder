{"text":"Benna's is among the largest of the Polish bakery/delis on Roncesvalles (and there's quite a few), but even here the products are crammed in pretty tight, with many stacked on top of each other or on crates.  They have an excellent selection of Kolbasa and other kinds of cured sausage in their deli counter, but it's a bit tough to get an order in if you're not speaking Polish--fight on, though, cause they're great. The baked goods area is less impressive and a bit scaled back, mostly featuring bagged breads from other bakeries."}
{"text":"Excellent polish supermarket. Great deli, desserts, pickles, bread, jams, etc! It looks nicer and more spacious after the renovation, they have also added a hot food section which I have yet to try."}
{"text":"Long live Benna's.  With each passing month seeing the shutting down of another old Roncesvalles mom and pop in favour of another awful boutique, Benna's stands proud. Benna will surely be the last grand lady standing. Traditional Polish grocery store with prepared foods ready to go. No BS, real deal stuff."}
{"text":"My dog is adorably cute. But she is a hound, and will find any food within snout's reach.   My dear friend made the mistake of coming over with a bag of 6 Polish doughnuts in her bag. The dog waited until the cover of darkness (and until my guests and I got sufficiently inebriated) to stealthily devour said bag of doughnuts, leaving no trail of crumbs.  Those doughnuts weren't from Benna's, but the 'I'm so sorry my dog devoured your doughnuts, here's some to replace them' were.   From the various flavours they had, I chose strawberry, mango, and plum. At $0.80 each, I thought they were well priced. I only had a bite of one, but they seemed very fresh and were well enjoyed by my friend (who now knows that smuggling baked goods into my house will not go unnoticed)."}
{"text":"One of the best Polish delis in the city.  Great pickles, sauerkraut and their polish meat selection is incredible (dozens of different meat options).  The kabanosi, and gypsy kielbasa are very tasty (I never leave without buying some) and the baked desserts are rich, sweet and creamy.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Just had to comment that their breads, paczki (polish donuts), and cheese danishes are delicious and authentic. And everything is made on the spot, unlike one reviewer suggested. I used to live on Ronces, and I've seen the huge bakery in the back. The bakers there are busy making fresh baked goods from the early morning.  Well priced too. I always stop here when I make a visit to the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I'm glad Piegus European bakery closed down otherwise I wouldn't have visited Benna's. For a small grocery/bakery I'm impressed with the wide selection of products, pickles, pierogi, smoked sausages, desserts, baked goods & prepared foods.  I came early on a Saturday and it was busy but luckily no line up at the cash register. I came only for the paczki aka Polish filled doughnuts and they did not disappoint. They were light, airy, soft and not overly sweet. I really liked the rose hip filled one the most out of the 3 ($1/each).  I will most definitely come back for their homemade cooked foods and more paczki. There's no tables or chairs in the store so it will have to be takeout, too bad ."}
{"text":"I came here with my Polish friend who was looking for very specific items and didn't want to venture out to Starsky or Yummy Supermarkets. This place is more of a corner store with focus on Polish items. Layout is OK and they don't have the sheer quantity of the bigger supermarkets but they do seem to have a bit of everything. The baked goods looked tempting with a meat counter having decent variety of products. The cured meat selection was OK from what I was told.  My friend also commented that she likes the desserts here as they are authentic.  Checkout is interesting as there are separate lines from cash and debit/credit transactions. I think I will visit them for a dessert fix if I am in the area."}
{"text":"I am Polish so I may be biased but I love Polish food. I love all the prepared deli items. Benna offers a wide variety of traditionally Polish deli good. Delicious head cheeses of different varieties, garlic and double smoked kielbasa, dried and spicy kabanosy are just a few  of the yummy selection.  They also offer a large variety of jarred and prepared polish foods as well as unique spice and soup packages that will add to your kitchen that eastern european flavour. They also have an extensive bakery where you can find the typical polish sweets like sernik (cheesecake) and packi (donuts with plum marmalade). You can also buy the typical rye breads and other staples of the polish cusine. I definitely recommend checking this place out and do not be worr"}
{"text":"Wish I spoke Polish.   Love this store as I was told by my Accupuncturist to get raspberry syrup added to hot water & sip to assist with colds. I don't have a cold but not love this hot drink.   So syrup, fresh made hot ham for my son, mixed fudge, 4 kaiser for &1, and some savoury pastries.   I was thrilled when I saw the credit card signs above one of the cash registers!"}
{"text":"Awesome place to get fresh meats, cheeses and other Polish cuisine. Awesome selection of refrigerated and frozen goods such as pierogi, cream cheeses, salads and more. Also have fresh breads, desserts and packaged dry foods. Great little mini supermarket in the heart of roncy. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Benna's!"}
{"text":"I miss it!!! It is closed for renos now, was my regular go to for great groceries. Awesome paczki and cured meats. Keep us informed which ones are nitrate-free."}
{"text":"The best I have found. Prepared food is tasty and fresh. Staff are hardworking. There are linups yes but it shows how good Benna is."}
{"text":"An excellent place for Polish food. There's a good variety of things, and it tastes good. The place is nice and clean too. Highly recommended if you like Polish food."}
{"text":"They have a great ready-made food selection. I ordered a bunch of different things I didn't know what they were with exception for the veal  but they all tasted good:) now that's trust  The place is always packed so expect a lineup in a little bit of this organization ,I did know the desserts they had cannolis Whip cakes, Lemon bar and they all were amazing I really enjoyed all of their food it was fantastic. I brought a box of their desserts down to my office and everyone enjoyed them no complaints in fact people recognized the deli as one of Toronto is best!  The only thing I did not like was the Young lady behind the counter yelling about a service dog that was wearing it's badge she was really rude. The food was fantastic!"}
{"text":"I found the deli counter staff to be very rude...? And there's a whole lot of places to buy polish foods in Roncy!"}
{"text":"Pierogis and pepperettes are high on my list of comfort foods. Pockets of potato joy and meat sticks = perfection. Naturally, I'm in love with all Polish grocers, and Benna's recently topped my list.   They stock all kinds of wonderful products that are hard to find, from mustard pickles to cabbage roles, to fishes cured in eastern European craziness. Luckily, if you're trying to just stock up on the uge, they have a decent grocery selection and deli, too.   I have a freezer full of cheddar and potato pierogis and the moment they run out, I'll be running back to Brenna's."}
