{"text":"Pizza cutter is a staple in Avon Lake! Very fresh, home made taste. Lots of toppings and cheese is always piled on! Sauce is fresh tasting. Their prices are pretty cheap. Menu is simple and always have specials going on. Employees are friendly and order is always ready when promised. A very tasty mom and pop pizza places...not like commercial tasting Pizza Hut or dominos."}
{"text":"Pizza is good, but not great.  I considered three stars however I believe this place deserves a four due to the prices being more than reasonable.  Veggies were fresh. Salad was fresh and cheesed nicely. We will order again when looking to feed the masses as they are a solid economy good option."}
{"text":"If you lived in Avon Lake chances are, you've eaten here.  If you are visiting Avon Lake, stay away from the cookie cutter pizza shops.  If you want the same crappy pizza you can get in Denver too, go to Dominos.  If you want the best greasy pizza on the planet, well at least Avon Lake, eat here.  Locally owned and operated for the past, forever."}
{"text":"The best pizza in Avon Lake. Cheap and fast."}
{"text":"Small mom and pop pizza place that doesn't taste like \"all the rest\". It's an Avon Lake favorite! More expensive lately, but the pizza is great.   I always support local businesses.   Yummy pizza!"}
{"text":"Good pizza but they were less than pleasant on the phone. Then I showed up to pick up our LARGE pizza and it's TINY. When I asked about it they said they have SMALL, LARGE and XL. So in other words their large is really a MEDIUM.  Be careful what you order if you're trying to feed a family. Too bad they didnt bother to tell us when we ordered."}
{"text":"When visiting family in Avon Lake we were always pressed to find really good pizza in the Avon Lake/Avon area that was nearly as good or on par with the best pizzas we were used to having in our native Youngstown area or anything on the East side of Cleveland or Little Italy.  Also many chain pizza shops in the immediate area usually left us rather disappointed.  If Pizza Cutter is not at par with the best pizzas in NE Ohio it is close.    I personally think that it is the best in the Avon Lake/Avon area and so does my sister's family who live right in Avon Lake.   The pizzas are authentic with quality ingredients with a crust that is not too thick.  Their wings are very good too.  Avoid all the chain pizzerias in the area and make Pizza Cutter your default pizza choice, you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"I like their pizza. It is the epitome of the mom and pop shop pizza. You are not going to get the papa johns or dominos pizza prices but the taste is worth the extra few bucks."}
{"text":"The pizza here was very very good my kids and I both loved it. The lady working upfront was not very personable. I will go back."}
{"text":"We have recently discovered this pizza shop. We really enjoyed the pizza and felt it was fairly priced. Our third time ordering there, I bit into something so hard that it could have broken my tooth (had I not have been a cautious chewer).  I pulled it out and it was hard and black. My husband suggesting it was just a piece of coal from the oven. I continued eating. Onto a completely different slice, bit into another hard piece, spit it out and again, same black material. We called the pizza shop and they were quick to offer a credit or to remake the pizza. However, that wasn't the reason for the call - we wanted to know what the black material was and to prevent it from happening to others. After about five minutes, they admitted that they're pans are over 30 years old and occasionally they break off!!!  Time to replace your pans & time for us to not order from here again."}
{"text":"I have been here at least a dozen times but Pizza Cutter isn't your dime a dozen pizza chain.   Pizza Cutter is a small staple in Avon Lake with big flavor. They have a perfect crust and quality  toppings. I have ordered pizza from many places, enough to know that Pizza Cutter has the best Deluxe specialty pizza you will find. There's always something I dislike about a pizza shop's Deluxe pizza. It's usually either the type of onions or green peppers they use. Pizza Cutter got it right though. They have perfected the Deluxe pizza! All the ingredients they use are fresh, and of quality. Plus they aren't skimpy with the toppings.   The staff has always been very friendly and there's even a liquor and beverage store conveniently located right next door.   Love this place! You gotta try it!   Tip: Check their online specials before you call. Don't forget to mention the special you intend to use when ordering. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We ordered pizza, cheesy bread, and wings for $23. The pizza was pretty good. The wings were so undercooked we had to cook them more at home after even specifying to cook them well done. We tried it because we wanted something different. However, the lady who answered the phone was less than welcoming. I almost hung up because I was taken back by her rudeness. In person she seemed better because I'm sure she could tell I was shocked by her tone. The delivery lady cashed me out and I tried to make small talk with her and she just wasn't having it either. The prices are fair and the pizza was good but I'd rather pay a little more and see a happy face."}
{"text":"Local, pizza place that's been around since 1982.  They're located a few doors down from the Avon Lake Post Office. They make their dough and sauce fresh daily! They also have subs, salads, calzones, and wings!  Their crust is nice and chewy and not greasy at all! The workers are very friendly and it doesn't take long for a pizza! Ask about their monthly pizza specials and check for coupons in the Towne Money Saver!"}
