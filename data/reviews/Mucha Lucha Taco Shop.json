{"text":"Love this place! Authentic, fresh and delicioso! I totally pig out whenever I go here. The carne asada street tacos are amazing, excellent nachos, yummy salsas. Friendly atmosphere and great prices, what's not to love? If you're looking for real Mexican food, go here, you won't be disappointed. A big thank you to my fellow Yelpers, another great find via your awesome reviews :)"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that the food is exceptionally tasteful and I've visited the restaurant on three occasions.  Today's visit was a very awkward and frustrating encounter as I had my family of 4 with me and they start making our order but only take 2 of my 4 order requests before they start making the orders for the people behind me. I have to explain that i still need two more burritos and it made me feel like I was asking for too much in a way as they were trying to move us through with the line getting longer.  At this point not a big deal. 

Then the lady making the burritos begins to get flustered with me as I am trying to explain what I want and she begins to have a condescending tone when speaking to me.  I look over to my wife with a \"did you just see that\" look.  The cashier then glances at the woman giving her \"the look\" upon which the woman smiles sarcastically at me while she flutters her eyes.  At this point I basically wanted to pay for my food -eat and leave.  There was another reviewer on this thread that said it best.  No great food is worth being treated this rude.  I don't look to mud sling with this post. I am simply stating my experience and I do hope that this restaurant addresses it's issues and flourishes in our city.  Until then- I won't go back."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place because it looked cool. We were not disappointed at all!  Girlfriend got the Three Flour Taco plate which came loaded to the brim and I got the Wet Burrito with the red sauce. It was very spicy, but AMAZING!

The folks here were amazing, the decor was AMAZING!

We just found our new Taco Shop :)"}
{"text":"Finally! A legit Mexican place in Gilbert. Definitely recommend the sopes. The red chicken is life changing! You can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"The tacos are flavorful, the habanero salsa is awesome, surf n turf burrito is great with huge shrimp, chips are fresh. Pretty good prices, need to goblin earlier as lunch time wait is long."}
{"text":"Best tacos! the food is fresh and the tortillas are really good great people working here to really nice"}
{"text":"Best Mexican style food in AZ. The people here are super friendly. The place is so clean. Having this in Gilbert is awesome  I will probably never go to chipotle... Thank you Mucha Lucha for coming to Gilbert"}
{"text":"The concept of the Restaurant is very good, having the Luchador masks and theme really fits the type of food they sell. At first it seems to be traditional Mexican food that takes you back home, and the staff is very friendly/attentive to your order. It may have been a bad day for them but the food I ordered was not that great. It seems to be more of an Americanized Mexican cuisine, and in my opinion didn't have that traditional Mexican spark. I ordered a Carne Asada burrito with beans, rice and a few of the fixings yet wasn't amazed as the flavors were very bland. My friend however ordered a Fajita Mix plate which was more appealing to my taste. I may eventually return to give it a second chance and try something different."}
{"text":"Great tacos and cold beer!!! These were fresh and ready to go. My fav was the green chili and barbocoa. The flavor was great and just enough spice where it wasn't overwhelming."}
{"text":"Delicious fresh Mexican food. The meats were so tender and full of flavor. Plenty of options to place as toppings. Great salsa bar that can really pack the heat. Great stop and worth every penny."}
{"text":"I ordered to go over the phone and told them I would arrive in 15 minuets to pick it up. I arrived about 20 minuets and they told me they had to throw out my food because it got to cold and I would have to reorder. I was excited to try it out but the purpose of calling ahead of time was to have the food ready not to wait again. Not recommended to order over the phone."}
{"text":"This is without a doubt. Hands down. THE best Mexican food in Tempe, Scottsdale, and Phoenix area. I come here all the time, and get the Surf and Turf Burrito. If you do, I recommend adding 3 squeezed limes, and an extra scoop of salsa. I absolutely love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Paid $20 for lunch today.  The food was horrid.   Meat was dry as a bone, corn tortilla was hard and old.  I don't generally complain or return food, so it was immediately discarded.  Instead had Chinese Food nearby, wich explains the $20 lunch bill."}
{"text":"Love this place! Real Mexican food with a lot of choices for picky eaters like myself. The Carne asada and barbacoa are to die for! I always suggest for newbies to get the 5 street tacos and try as many meats as you can! 

I have eaten at all locations and I was extremely excited when the opened the new one by my house! So now I have a location by work and home...

This would be a 5 star rating.... However the new location on 75th ave is never open on Sundays and the hours change daily without notification. The unfortunate part is often times when I want to spend my money here and get great fresh Mexican food they aren't opened as advertised.

Hopefully as they get more established in the area they will stay open longer as well as Sunday!"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch.  Fast service, delicious food, good price!  I had three hard shell tacos and tried their chicken, barbacoa and beef.  Seasoned perfectly and they didn't even need much toppings to enhance the taste."}
{"text":"So glad this place opened in my neighborhood! All of the ingredients are fresh and they have a lot of options to choose from! We tried the rolled tacos with green chile beef and a burrito with pork and both were excellent! They don't skimp on the portions either! Everyone that worked there was very friendly, definitely will be back to try the street tacos too!"}
{"text":"Try the carne asada and the rolled tacos!  I love the recipes here and the variety of salsa.  This is my new favorite place.  It's delicious."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of state.  We know our Mexican food coming from LA and this DID NOT disappoint.  Authentic food with authentic salsas.  We thought we'd have food to take home...ended up taking it home in our bellies.  Happy tummies and tasty salsa burps all night."}
{"text":"How are you not open during the hours you post? If you say 9am and I go at 12pm then I would expect there to be someone there. I call another location and they tell me they have no idea."}
{"text":"Some of the best traditional Mexican tacos I've had in Arizona. Mucha Lucha has a large selection of meats and your order is customized to what you want. 
My family cannot wait for Tuesdays to roll around as we've made this a weekly tradition."}
{"text":"We love this place!  We get the wet burrito and can never finish it!  Good quality good and love supporting local businesses"}
{"text":"I ate there and had the 5 Street Taco Plate. Really good!!
I Chose Barbacoa, Carne Asada and Green Chile Beef, you can choose three meats in the 5 Street Taco Plate. I still cannot decide which I liked the most. The very nice Lady who waited on me was friendly and efficient.
I tried all the hot sauces and they are good and hot, yeah!
Brought mine home and they were very good still when I ate them. Good tortillas.
I will be back."}
{"text":"Wow!
Finally found a great taco shop on the westside!
Tinga Chicken, carne asada and green chili beef are excellent. Do yourself a favor and order the jalapeño cream cheese and chips for a starter, $2 well spent. Already planning my next visit!"}
{"text":"Very very good!  I tried the three flour tacos, each with a different meat (they have like 12+ to choose from!), and they were all very good.  This place will definitely be at the top of my list."}
{"text":"Very consistent and better than all the taco shops in Arizona. Only thing I regret is going vegetarian before trying their meat lol. But I(they) make a pretty damn good wet burrito. Wife loves the tacos and rolled tacos she gets. All employees are very nice and do an excellent job in all aspects(food prep and fufilling order, and customer service."}
{"text":"All I wanted was tacos. Expectations were low. I mean, it's in the food court, at pv mall. But I wanted tacos. I got tacos. And so much more. Prepared in front of me, to my exact request. Asada perfectly seasoned and cooked. Small corn tortillas, fresh, not falling apart. Five tortillas loaded with asada, topped with cilantro, roasted corn, fine chopped onions. Lime wedges on the side. The cashier/chef; friendly, efficient. All this buried in a tiny shop in the food court.

Feeling chipotle? Try Mucha Lucha instead. Spend the same amount but for better food and a local shop."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good. They have precooked meats in it's juices and they fry it again when you order. They added oil to it I believe. I was excited to add my own toppings but they add it for you. That was a bit of a downer for me. Also, everything is cross contaminated. They wear gloves but they use their fingers / no utensils to add the toppings. The restaurant is small and all the tables were dirty each time I went in. They have fountain sodas and sodas in glass bottles. I don't remember seeing horchata or Jamaica or anything."}
{"text":"Incredible, authentic, Delicious this is absolutely wonderful Mexican food at a reasonable price! Big portions authentic Mexican food cannot go wrong must try!"}
{"text":"We tried this place on a whim, and now it is part of our regular lunch rotation each week. The food is excellent, inexpensive and is prepared right in front of you. tacos, burros, quesadillas, or mix it all up in a bowl, its all fantastic, but my favorite is the vinegar chicken, in street taco fashion. Close second is JJs Quesadilla with carne asada. It looks rough from the outside, but head right in and you will be happy you did!"}
{"text":"Great authentic mexican food made right in front of you. Great prices too."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, hard to hear since it's in a mall but their barbacoa burrito is to die for."}
{"text":"I've been here about 4 times now. The burritos are very good. Love all the different meat and topping options (think Chipotle with more variety). I have tried to go two separate times and they were closed although their hours indicated that they should be open. It seems to be a family run place so it is understandable that things come up, but disappointing when you're craving some good Mexican food! Also they seem to be a bit disorganized. If there are one or two people in front of you it takes about 20 minutes to get through the line."}
{"text":"Pretty good tacos! All the near was seasoned well and you get loaded with onions and cilantro. I asked for the hot salsa and the last warned me it was very hot. She was right, my mouth was on fire when I was finished and it was delicious. Definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"This place is the real deal!  Not much on curb appeal but who cares when the food is as fresh and plentiful as this place is serving up!!  Get in early to beat the lunch crowd, as it fills up quickly with the local workin' folk!"}
{"text":"The food is good but be sure the person waiting on you understands the difference between mild and spicy. The biggest turn off is they don't seem to have air conditioning.  I don't understand how a place can stay in business without air conditioning."}
{"text":"Great Food I love the carne asada burrito. Nice staff . love the art work . I go there almost every week. Very family orientated . not costly either .  great place to go to. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Phenomenal.

The staff is amazing. Very friendly, patient and personable. I don't think I will ever go to Chipotle ever again. 

The food is super fresh. I have had the nachos and a burrito bowl. Very filling. And the best part yet is they have Pepsi!

The restaurant is clean and plenty of parking. 

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Nothing fantastic about this place. The meats were so so and the ambience non existent. I'll stick to BYT when I'm hankering for a taco next time!"}
{"text":"WOW! Absolutely phenomenal customer service. Food was delicious. Fresh made for you. Very clean (food and restaurant). Love the decor."}
{"text":"Fantastic shrimp tacos and Churros!  Very authentic and low cost.  Nice staff. Beautiful sunset."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time and it was great.  Can't wait to go back and support our local business owners.  So glad we finally have a place around here for good burritos. I will add more comments as I experience the menu..."}
{"text":"Just had the chorizo burrito shared with coworkers they made me go back and get 2 more very good. However the place is under repair I feel once its finished will look wonderful. Food is great!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for delicious tacos busting with flavor, this is your place. They are set up like a chipotle, so you pick your dish, meat, and toppings as you go. If you're unsure which type of meat to pick, ask for a sample they will gladly oblige."}
{"text":"Really good! Had the 5 Carne Asada street tacos. Meat had nice seasoning and they cook the meat right in front of you.  You can customize what you want on them. Employees were very nice and will tell you what is spicy and what is not. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Legit. I will def be going back. I had the 5 street tacos and it did. It disappoint. Friendly staff and good customer service."}
{"text":"Disappointed! This place is delicious, it's not the food that's the problem! My husband drove over to pick up a large order, he arrived at about 7:20pm (Saturday 9/9/17) and it was closed! The sign says it closes at 8pm, no indication of an earlier closure on this specific day - sooooo annoying.... I don't understand why places do this?! The girl that was cleaning up inside just shrugged her shoulders when another potential customer got her attention and pointed out the time... not cool!!!"}
{"text":"Some good Mexican food. Usually get the chicken and they have a couple different options for the marinated chicken, but can also grill chicken. It's kinda like Chipotle where you order in line and pick and choose what you want. Except the food is actually good. Don't think you can get a supersize burrito here though, but still get the right amount of food. Small place and never crowded so you can get in and out quick. I'll definitely come again rather than going to Chipotle."}
{"text":"Outstanding - I am in town for meetings and found Mucha Lucha for lunch.  Wow spectacular food.  I knew I was in a special place when I shRed I was a newbie and the customers in line were evangelists."}
{"text":"Best horchata I've had in a long time. I had a chorizo egg and potato breakfast burrito, then you can select your choice of toppings, like the real deal pinto beans and a nice selection of salsas. They have multiple topping choices including chopped romaine if you want to gringo'ize your food."}
{"text":"Delicious TACOS and huge and tasty burritos!!  

For TACOS:  Similar presentation and style to a subway - choose your tortilla, meat, and toppings with an array of salsa, cabbage, lettuce, cilantro, pickled onion (spicy yummy!), quest, guacamole, sour cream and more!!

Best Meat:  Pork Carnitas - crispy grizzle with lots of flavor - melt in your mouth!!

Best Tortilla:  Corn (try 5 street tacos)

Best Toppings:  Pico, Queso, pickled onion, cilantro, and JALAPEÑO SOUR CREAM."}
{"text":"So thankful me and my co workers found this spot! It's so quick for lunch. Fresh everything they don't skimp on the amount. They also have an amazing salsa bar!"}
{"text":"Who says you can't get good Mexican food in Arizona?  Not me anymore.  The food here is so tasty.  The chile verde is delicious and nice and spicy.  Everything is fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"First time there today and the food is great, very tasty and if you like it hot you can get it hot and still has great taste. We are for sure coming back. Best taco burrito shop in Gilbert."}
{"text":"Shares the Super nachos and 5 street tacos, the chicken and carne sada meat were very tasty."}
{"text":"Went again.. chimichanga was fantastic got the carnitas was very impressed.  Portion was a bit large but couldn't stop."}
{"text":"Great food, fantastic prices, and familiar faces make this place exactly what a local could want. I personally love going here multiple times per week for lunch as I work almost quite literally next door, and this place is somewhere I can get the same exact thing over and over again without ever getting tired of it! If you're looking for satisfying and delicious food. Then you've found the right place with Mucha Lucha!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem on the west side..everything on the menu is bomb! Most definitely got my Mexican food fix!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I both love this place. I got the 3 flour tacos w carne asada and shrimp. Topped it with everything they suggested and it was delicious, I especially liked the Chipotle sauce. Hubby got the street tacos and tried several different meats. He loved the green Chile salsa. Super fast service. No complaints about anything. We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I went to Mucha Lucha yesterday and had 5 street tacos. Their carne asada is so good!! My boyfriend got a fajita burrito and it was huge and so delicious! Very authentic and full of flavor. Their jalapeno cream cheese is to die for! I loved their mild green salsa too. Everyone is very friendly. Going back this morning to try a breakfast burrito!! Love this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Great customer service! Loved the surf and turf burrito! Street tacos were delicious too."}
{"text":"Food was absolutely delicious we had carne asada street tacos and a meat quesadilla. It was by far the most delicious Mexican restaurant we've been to!"}
{"text":"Amazing Mexican food! Setup somewhat like chipotle, they have a ton to choose from! The luchador theme is just as badass as the food. Authentic and absolutely delicious"}
{"text":"Nice little shop. They have a simple menu. The street tacos are worth the price. The rest of the menu items are a bit overpriced."}
{"text":"This is a favorite for my wife and I. We've both sampled a few of their dishes and they're quite good. The asada beef is one of our favorite choices, but all the other meat has proven to be tasty as well. I don't particularly recommend the rolled tacos, as they just appear to be frozen, fried, then topped with your choice of meat. The wet burrito, on the other hand, is incredible. One staff member in particular (possibly the owner?) is always very helpful and willing to provide advice on what goes best with everything."}
{"text":"Outstanding hole in the wall authentic food. The quality and flavors of the meats and salsas are out of this world."}
{"text":"I have to say this taco shop brought back memories from my childhood  waiting for my Nana's carne asada smothered in her Ancho salsa!!!
I highly recommend this restaurant and will definitely be back with my family."}
{"text":"I liked the food a lot but this is AZ and you need air conditioning. I was so warm. The food was spicy and flavorful, the way I like it, but the restaurant itself was crowded and tiny and hot. It's probably perfect for takeout."}
{"text":"Their vinaigrette chicken street tacos..HEAVEN!  I love Mexican food and am very picky about where to get it.  Mucha Lucha is excellent!  Try it, you won't be disappointed!  :-)"}
{"text":"Their food was amazing! One of the best fast food  Mexican restaurants I've eaten at in the entire  valley. I'll come to the mall just to eat here! The tanga chicken was amazing!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience the first time here.
Attentive,polite staff that balanced service and speed well. 
The food was above par. Our party collectively tried the carne asada, chile verde, barbacoa, and the tinga chipotle chicken. 
We would order any of them again! The tinga was my favorite. Great spice and a unique flavor that worked well with the cheesy, gooey, \"TACODILLA\" it was stuffed into. Check them out! I know we will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican hands down. Their condiment bar with different spice level sauces are to die for."}
{"text":"I REALLY like this place. you can tell it is family owned and the family works here. Most importantly, the food was delicious. I had the \"Tacodilla\" with Carne Asada and it was delicious. the restaurant is simple and authentic. I will be back."}
{"text":"This place was so good. I am not sure how it has any bad reviews.  Got a burrito bowl with grilled fish on it.  Portion was perfect.  Fish was fresh and grilled perfectly.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"MUCHA LUCHA TACO SHOP! Best Mexican food in the state of Arizona. I recommend the macho fries with carne asada ! They have a fantastic friendly and helpful staff. I recommend dropping in ASAP"}
{"text":"We loved the flour tacos and street tacos! There is such a great variety of meats and toppings to choose from, and the ingredients are fresh and high-quality. The corn and flour tortillas are tender and sweet, making the tacos even tastier than what most Mexican restaurants offer. And for those of us who like spicy meats, this place has some incredible recipes. What a great find for tacos that are anything but ordinary!"}
{"text":"Great street tacos. If I was only rating the food it would be difficult not to give 5 stars. Didn't even think twice about the pricing ordered more than enough food to go around. But best is saved for last. The owner who went out of her way to point out she's the owner... Who in the world cares... I'm ordering food, eating and leaving bye"}
{"text":"Awesome. Food, service, prices, decor, clean and on and on... This place rocks. Thank you to the staff that are so friendly and willing to make you happy as one of their patrons. One of a kind and worth the visit. Just remember Sunday's is rest and they are closed.  5 stars :p and yumm yumm"}
{"text":"2nd time coming here out of convenience. 1st time lady owner very rude. 2nd time even ruder if possible .Younger girl rude at checkout. Skimpy on everything prices very high so should be more generous. Lady scowls and complains in front of me because I asked for more then a drop of cheese on 10$ NACHOS! Only thing positive is the nice guy with glasses. If you run a business customer service is everything! Food was ok as it barely had any substance or I was told I had to pay extra! For cheese on a nacho!"}
{"text":"We made the drive down from Scottsdale...so glad we did! 

The food is AHMAZING!! We had the Super Nachos and the Bandera Wet Burrito. Both were full of flavor, spices, texture and looked amazing! 

It's so worth the drive...even on a Friday night! You have to come try it all!"}
{"text":"I was craving street tacos and was in the pv area. Checked out yelp for some suggestions when lucha came up as one to try. I was a bit hesitant when I noticed it was at the mall food court but was really craving street tacos. Glad I did! Delicious!!! Full of flavor!  My husband had the chicken tingá quesadilla and hes picky! It was a 10 hands down. I had the steak tacos and I was happy as well. Only thing I would like to see is less stingy on the meat portion on the street tacos. Mines were a little on the scarce side.  Will definitely be back and would pay extra for double meat portion. *note. There are two Mexican food  spots in that food court, make sure you go to lucha for the tacos."}
{"text":"Every time we have gone we have been greeted by Fun decor and friendly staff.

The food is fresh and excellent in flavor.  The heat scale for the food is well thought out.  If you don't like spicy food or too spicy ask the staff for a taste to make sure it's too your liking.

So far everything we have tried as a family has been very good and we keep going back to this neighborhood fun spot"}
{"text":"I was visiting my parents and like to try local restaurants. 

We wanted tacos and burritos for lunch and we found this place on Yelp and I am glad we did. 

We had two orders of street tacos - pork, chicken and carne asada - and a carne asada wet burrito. 

All of the ingredients were fresh and of high quality. The food was prepared right in front of us and the employees were super friendly.  The quality of the meal was very good and I would eat here anytime I'm in the area visiting."}
{"text":"My family absolutely loves this small family owned biz! It's our favorite Mexican place to eat in Gilbert. I know the food is fresh and can watch it being cooked! sometimes you can't trust Mexican food in az. And this is by far the best!! The family is super nice too. Place is clean, family friendly! 5 star all the way"}
{"text":"Good fresh, very pleasant workers behind counter. There 5 taco plate is a great deal."}
{"text":"This place is great!! I had the green chili beef wet burrito which was very spicy and has tons of flavor. You can tell they slow cook their meats with various chili's. Skip the local and national chains and come check this place out! I'm so glad this place opened in my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"The best Horchata I've ever had. Creamy but not too rich. Just a hint of cinnamon and full of flavor. Riceless and served over crushed ice. I haven't had better!"}
{"text":"Excellent street Tacos! Tried 2 different meats; both great. They offer 3 different varieties of each chicken and beef. We had the surf and turf burrito. Plenty big for two adults and we thought it was great. Kids really enjoyed the street Tacos. Great stop if you're cruising the 101 by Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Excellent experience, great service and delicious Mexican food. Another high quality option in the east Valley !"}
{"text":"Very good authentic Mexican food with a large variety of meat. And it's close to home!"}
{"text":"Tasty food.  Tried the asada beef, tinga chicken, barbacoa, and vinagretta chicken.  Think my favorite were the asada and vinagretta. Bottles and cans only for drinks.  Glad this place is close to my house.   Will be back."}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh! Local family-owned business, owner is always behind the counter cooking and you can taste the heart & soul in the food. Always very clean, large portion sizes and great service. The surf & turf burrito is a favorite but you'll love anything you try."}
{"text":"Thre reviews were not wrong, this place was good have the 5 street tacos and they were very tasty.

Very clean establishment and friendly staff.

I will visit again before I have to go home."}
{"text":"This was def a surprise! Didn't expect a good taco shop to be in the mall but we will be back for sure! It's very hard to find a decent REAL taco shop in AZ. We have tried many but this one was actually pretty good."}
{"text":"Very good! We got 2 orders of the street tacos. I had fried fish and shared with my kids who scarfed it down too. 
I think it would be great if they added single street tacos or any tacos as my kids wanted more but they weren't going to eat 5 more. 

It was a little difficult to communicate with the cashier but the gentlemen behind the counter was very helpful. 

Go early because it got really busy after we sat down. 

Will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"This place is hella good!

Big burrito for really reasonable price!

I got the shrimp burrito - has nice huge pieces of shrimp and you customize whats inside. Get the jalapeno cremecheese stuff.

It tastes even better when you get it \"wet\"

One of the best mexican places in AZ!"}
{"text":"This is the best fast Mexican out there, this Mucha actually makes you refried beans from scratch if you ask, and they don't use lard! Every chip, tostada and rolled taco is fried to order. Honestly, this is my favorite place, hands down."}
{"text":"This was some of the best Mexican food I have had. Love the way the meat was not infiltrated with fat. It was good meat. The service was exceptional. The atmosphere was awesome and very clean. Men in masks and Pit Bull...hello!!! Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"I almost don't want to review this place. I'm afraid that people will bring all the people lined up outside Backyard Taco up the street over here! They should be here! Delicious. Get the sopes or 5 street tacos. Staff is friendly and the selection is amazing. Going back soon and often."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty! We ordered a carne asada quesadilla and asada rolled tacos. The meat was fresh, tender and flavorful. Their food isn't overly greasy and reasonably priced. I will definitely come back the next time I visit AZ!"}
{"text":"Very nice little local taco shop looks like it's family run they have a huge variety of meats for your tacos so you get exactly what you want when your tacos are made.  This is much better than the large chain taco shops."}
{"text":"We have been going here since they opened.  Food is EXCELLENT. They didn't have fountain drinks at first, but have added them. They are very customer friendly. We have been going about once a week now as we love it so much. It seems word is out how excellent they are, as they seem to always have a line now!  

Only two downsides - they don't post their hours, and they don't have much room for the line of people."}
{"text":"I'm on a quest to find Arizonas best Street tacos and this place just jumped right to the front of the list. I was just driving by at dinner time and saw it and thought I'd give it a chance. Nice, clean, new atmosphere with fun Luchador design. The staff was really helpful, explaining everything but not being overbearing. I had the five street tacos with pork and beef. Lots of good meats to choose from. Also, they let you choose what you want on your street tacos. They have a few awesome sauces and a little salsa bar. Everything tasted great, and they gave me a bottle of water for free even though I didn't even ask for one. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! Best tacos I've had in such a long time! I got the 3 flour tacos with chicken and carne asada and kept me full and satisfied. The stars is friendly and the restaurant is clean. My family and I will be back...a lot!"}
{"text":"First time in and I will be back! Fresh and piled high, they give you a ton of food and they are proud of every bite. I get the surf and turf burrito, a handful of huge shrimp with onions and peppers then joined by a lean Carne asada.  Toppings are fresh and plentiful, the Pico is fresh and has just the right kick. Phenomenal, can't wait to go back...or have them deliver. Such a sweet option!!!"}
{"text":"Wow! We happened in here on accident but it was absolutely amazing!

The food was inexpensive and delicious. I appreciated the spiciness of the ingredients and the street tacos were very authentic!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were excited to try this place after seeing all the good reviews.  We must have ordered the wrong thing, I guess.  I ordered the carne asada burrito.  The meat was just sitting there in some kind of juice, then the lady scooped a small portion on the griddle to heat it up... (not like Qdoba or Chipotle where they are grilling the meat fresh).  I don't like rice and beans in my burrito so I opted for lots of veggies and guacamole (which costs extra).  The burrito was wrapped so ALL the guacamole was at the very bottom of the burrito.  The very small portion of meat tasted just ok, not a whole lot of flavor and since I didn't add the rice and beans, there was SO MUCH tortilla...  Their salsas were really good and were the best thing.  My husband got the smothered chicken burrito.  Tasted ok but he had a lot of heartburn after and didn't feel so good after eating it.  Food was ok and a bit pricey for what it is. Don't think we'll be back, sadly as there are much better places like New Mexican Grill."}
{"text":"We just happened to come across this place and we will definitely come back. My husband had the wet burrito with beef green chile. He said it was the perfect amount of spicy. He loved it. The tortilla was huge. They let you chose the fillings and toppings in the same manner you do for a Chipotle Restaurant  burrito. I had the 3 flour tacos. I chose barbacoa, carnitas and carne asada. They were all good but the carnitas were my favorite. We also had the chips and jalapeno cream cheese. It was delicious!!!!!!! 
We loved  everything we ate and it was all very fresh. The only thing I will pass on next time is the rice. It tasted like instant plain white rice. I would have prefered something with more flavor to match the level of the rest of the food. Overall, I  am looking forward to returning to try more things."}
{"text":"My fiance and I stumbled upon this place and we are so glad we did! We've been here twice and both times it was delicious! It's set up like chipotle, except it's authentic Mexican food. We've only tried the burritos, so that's what my review is for :) I got a wet burrito each time I went, once with green sauce and once with red sauce. They were both good but the red sauce was my favorite, it had a little kick to it. They also have a salsa bar and all of the salsa's are delicious. They are also really friendly, and we've experienced great customer service both times we've visited."}
{"text":"Muy authentico!  First time in Phoenix and it lived up to the hype! In a Taco emergency call 9 Juan Juan! Great service, great food, priced accordingly. If your in Tempe/Scottsdale AZ area definitely check out Mucha Lucha! It will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Do you like the movie \"Nacho Libre\" with actor Jack Black? Do you love authentic Mexican food... and real Mexican music... and the creative world of Mexican wrestling? If yes, then follow this advice: Go to the corner of Miller Rd. and McKellips Rd. in Scottsdale, AZ. Next to the Circle K there is a \"Filibertos\" sign. The Mexican cook who took over the space, calls his new restaurant \"Santos Lucha Libre Taco Shop\". The food is fresh and the recipes and sauces are very good. I've had a burrito and a protein salad... I loved them both. I'd recommend to anyone that likes real-and-fresh Mexican food."}
{"text":"The tacos were amazingly delicious & the staff was very nice. Can't wait to come here again. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Awesome little taco shop in Gilbert!! Great, authentic mexican food and cool environment.   Lots of options and a friendly, helpful staff.  Don't miss this one."}
{"text":"So Good!  Go out of your way to look for this taco shopped tucked into a grocery store strip mall corner. We stopped today to grab some lunch and were reminded again just how good and fresh the food is. My husband had a wet burrito with carne asada. He doesn't like the beans and rice inside, and it was no problem getting them on the side. He kept eating and after each bite saying how good everything was. I had the super nachos and they were excellent. We also got an order of fries with jalapeño cream cheese, also very good. The portions are substantial and we will each get two meals from our choices. This is a no frills, great food restaurant that you should include in your dining rotation!"}
{"text":"This shop was located in a mall. The guy making the food was very thorough and diligent. I could tell he tried really hard and wanted to do a good job. But my burrito was SOO salty. It was also a very long wait. Next time, I will avoid this one. :("}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I had the surf and turf burrito, which was humongous and so fresh. It was probably 3-5 lbs of food . I also had the guacamole sauce and chips... So good! I will be coming back for a second time for sure during my one week starting in Arizona!"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best taco shop around. You can't go wrong with anything on this menu....seriously.  I am a foodie who travels a lot for work and have eaten everywhere...literally. I appreciate authentic quality and consistency.  Graciela is amazing and kind while Fernando is a master at his 'Surf and Turf burrito'.   
Now, for specifics on the food. The meat is well trimmed and always has just enough flavor to be extremely tasteful yet not overpowering.  Ingredients are always fresh and shows in the taste of salsa. The portions are definitely on the plus size. 
Even though they are closed in Sunday's, the day of rest is well deserved 'Mucha Lucha'!"}
{"text":"The first time I had ate at this establishment, I had a great experience. The second time I went to this establishment. I felt if I was talk to as a stranger by the staff, I feel as if my food was thrown together as if the kid was making it, and I'm highly disappointed in the customer service. I would not recommend or ever go back to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"If you love shrimp and you love burritos, you have to try their shrimp burrito, fajita style.  I always get this now.  It's one of those things you think about once you e had it.  Don't forget the chipotle sauce, that makes it a little tortilla wrapped piece of loveliness.  Yum.  Other stuff is good too.

I have been to Broadway Location and the one off Val Vista, both are identical in menu items and consistency between places."}
{"text":"Chipotle who? This is place has the best burritos in Peoria :)  I was craving a burrito and found this place. My husband went for pick up. The cost of the burrito was super cheap but still delicious. They don't charge for guacamole. I got the regular carnitas burro and it was delicious. You won't regret trying this place. I haven't tried anything else yet, but I look forward too."}
{"text":"Amazing Tacos. Been waiting for a place like this for a long time. Had spicy beef, chicken and Barbacoa. Would come back in an instant. Staff super friendly and even topped it off with a horchata on the house which was excellent. 
Definitely coming back every Tuesday. If not more frequent."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! All the food is so delicious. It is hard to find tacos this good in the area and the people working are very friendly. Definitely get the horchata too!"}
{"text":"Soooo Delicious! We live nearby and I spotted this place driving by. I assumed it'd be like a Filibertos (Yuck) or similar.  A month later I finally stopped in. I was impressed right when I entered on how clean this place is!! They have a simple menu but lots of meat options and fillers. Everything is made fresh as well, even  the tortillas I think. They cook it up to order! 
We got two breakfast burritos, I customized. Mine was potatoes, egg, cheese, onion, green pepper, cilantro,green chili chicken, beans, rice and a squeeze of their creme Chipotle sauce (The best)!! The burrito was HUGE!! The flavor was amazing! 
They also have a fresh salsa bar. 
They have Bottles of soda and Coke products on fountain. 

Definitely give them a try!! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Finally a great little home on the wall with real Mexican flavor! I had the 5 street tacos and my son had the super nachos. Great variety of meats. Fun decor and clean place. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I love this place for the breakfast burrito made to order right in front of you I always get one with eggs black beans cilantro onions Pico the really good sized for about 9 bucks little pricey I guess but well worth it the ladies that worked there are always super friendly the salsa bar is pretty good especially if they have fresh grilled jalapenos that's the best I try to make it there at least once a week since I found them maybe I'll try something else that's really hard to get me from those breakfast burritos"}
{"text":"Small family owned business that puts together a tasty steak quesadilla. He also made me a bowl of charro beans by frying up some chorizo and bacon and throwing that into his regular beans. It was delicious. It's not on the menu but if you're lucky maybe he'll make it for you too."}
{"text":"If you are craving tacos or burritos, this is the spot!  I'll be coming here instead of Chipotle now as everything is super fresh, but has so much more flavor!"}
{"text":"Amazing...I had an explosion of flavors in my mouth! Highly recommend them.  They are quick and very friendly"}
{"text":"This place is off the chain good. I grabbed 3 tacos each with different meats (green chili beef, chipotle chicken, and carne asada).  All the meats were great.  Full of flavor and spice.  However, what made this place ridiculously good was their attention to both fresh and authentic flavors.  My hard shell tacos?  Yeah, they fried them to order.  When I ordered the tacos they threw three fresh tortillas on the grill, then placed them in a fryer, then stuffed them with my meats and toppings.  Mouth-watering good.  The husband got the el-jefe burrito and was in love with it.  My recommendation though is to go with something where you can try a handful of their meats since they are so amazing!  If I lived nearby, this place would be a weekly stop for me.  I'll dream of you Mucha Lucha... until next time..."}
{"text":"We came here a few weeks ago because it was so close to the house. I had high hopes for this restaurant, as I've been looking for a good taco place. Sadly, we left disappointed.

First, the ordering process is extremely disorganized. When you order, they begin cooking your food. You then have to wait for your meat to finish cooking before they complete your order. My husband was ordering tacos, and they had to complete his entire order before they even took my order and began cooking the meat for my nachos. This meant that our meals were ready at completely different times. We were not able to select the type of meat we actually wanted, because they were nearly out of meat at 6pm on a Friday. We had to settle for what they had left on hand.  Shortly after they took our order, they locked the door and would not allow any more people in. It was kind of awkward.

The food was okay. Nothing special. We felt like it was very overpriced, and the portions were not a good value for the amount of money we paid. They had no fountain drinks, and no cups for water.  Luckily, we brought our own water, but I felt they really missed an opportunity here.

Since our visit, we have driven by several times. We actually thought that the restaurant had already closed down, because there was no one in the parking lot and the \"open\" sign was turned off in the middle of the day.  However, it appears that they just close shop when they run out of meat or decide they don't want to work that day. I doubt they will be around for long."}
{"text":"My kids and I were looking for the best breakfast burrito in Scottsdale. After reading a few reviews and a little driving we ended up at this little gem. The kids and I ordered the breakfast burrito. It was amazing!"}
{"text":"Super pleased to find a great Mexican food restaurant relatively close to home. Our family had the wet burrito (it's HUGE), 5 street tacos, nachos and 3 hard tacos. Absolutely delicious! Everything was fresh and the place is very clean. Limited seating if super busy but plenty of parking.

Also, we're Nacho Libre fans so the luchador theme was pretty cool. 

We will will be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Was really excited to try this place, ordered the fish tacos.  I felt kinda rushed while ordering although i was the only one in line.  The food itself was decent.  The only thing that put a damper on this place for me was the fact that she charged me extra for putting the beans on the side versus in my tacos.  I wouldn't want to return to try the other dishes if I'm going to be charged extra for something that already comes with it."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh, fast.  The barbacoa was fantastic and so was the service.  They were a bit slow at lunch time, so try this spot fast before it (hopefully doesn't) disappears.  Also a small space to eat-in, but the food is sooooo worth it and no more expensive than Chipotle.  Way better, though."}
{"text":"This place is DELICIOUS!!! The food is full of flavor and the quantity for the price is great! The staff is super friendly and the atmosphere is chill yet fun with the music. I definitely will be coming back and telling people about this little taco shop."}
{"text":"This is exactly what I've been looking for!!!! AMAZING spice, amazing food, unbelievable... truly a gem in the Paradise valley mall. I was so tempted to get seconds, ugh the struggle! If you're needing a break from shopping, STOP HERE AND LOOK NO FURTHER! Taco dollar tacos w/tinga chicken fully loaded was the bomb!"}
{"text":"Yum, had some great tacos here. Their meats & choices are fantastic! Definitely will go back!"}
{"text":"The best tacos I've had in Phoenix! They have a simple menu but with a lot of options for customizing, it's almost like a chipotle, but so much better! I got the three flour tacos with red Barbacoa and a bunch of different toppings. They throw the meat right on the grill to order so it gets hot and gets a bit of a char on it, it's delicious and I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I've been waiting for a place like this. It only existed in my dreams until now. 
Picture this. Filiberto style mixed with chipotle as the lay out. That's the first impression when you walk in along with the paintings of the Mexican wrestlers. 
The menu is simple like chipotle but similar ingredients as the normal fast food burrito places

All of that goes away when you try the food. I had the surf and turf burrito with pico and spicy guacamole. This burrito had huge shrimp and carne asada meat. 
The cook/owner allows you to customize your burrito with various ingredients and also asks you how you want them cooked. 

The 5 stars was easy for me and I plan on going back tomorrow."}
{"text":"Want some real deal tacos's come to this place, their street tacos are insanely good. Service is super friendly and helpful!!!"}
{"text":"I had the Asada Beef wet Burrito - it was really good. Most of their meats and sauces are spicy, be sure to ask for a sample first. The green is very spicy. Everyone was very friendly. The only bummer was the cheap plastic forks, which make it difficult to cut up and eat your burrito. Other than that it was a great experience."}
{"text":"I came in from Las Vegas and a work friend stated this was a place that needed to be tried! I don't regret it! I had the wet burrito with green child and it was amazing. A little on the spicy side which was just perfect!"}
{"text":"This place is an awesome find! Tried the shrimp fajita street tacos...yum! Plenty of topping choices, as well as a yummy salsa bar. When they say something is hot...believe it! I was very happy with the three different hot salsas that I tried. Very friendly people, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"One of the best burritos I've ever had. I recommend the bandera wet burrito. I'll be back whenever I'm in the area. So good."}
{"text":"Good food, good value....tiny quaint little shop with a ma and pa feel. May be one for all I know. I am a fan."}
{"text":"I'm a San Diego native and this was without doubt, the BEST Mexican food I've had here in Arizona. Shoutout to the owner who took my order and ensured that everything that left the line was perfect. They have great twists on rolled tacos! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I had the street tacos. They were flavorful. This location is in the mall. Doesn't look like much but man! I got 3 green chili beef tacos and 2 red carnita tacos. I was warned that the beef was pretty spicy. But I love spicy, so it is fine by me. Both meat were shredded. She put the red carnitas back on the grill for a little more heat. Loaded all the tacos with lettuce, cheese pickled red onions and a spicy cream sauce. I was warned again, especially about the spicy sauce on top of the spicy meat. 
They really weren't lying. I was ok until taco number 4. Started to feel the burn then. By the end of taco 5 I was in tears and my mouth was on fire!! But it was so so good! Taste was still there under the inferno. The red was a little sweet and the beef was peppery. I enjoyed. My belly was on fire for about an hour. Will go back to any location."}
{"text":"Tacos were good but the service was a little awkward. I could hardly hear the lady over the counter and I asked a few questions about the menu because it was my first time there but she looked at me annoyed like I was suppose to know. The food was fresh and they had authentic toppings like red onions and lemon. Probably will never come back here."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! My expectations of Mexican food are incredibly high and this place delivered! I had the tacodilla with asada, chicken tinga and barbacoa. Every single bite was delicious and every choice of meat had its own wonderful flavor. I love their simple menu that has so much opportunity to customize. I can't wait to try other things on their menu. The service was slower than I'm used to but they are grilling everything in front of you and customizing your order with toppings."}
{"text":"Fresh, delicious in a class by itself restaurant. The street tacos are phenomenal. So many options here. All of them good ones. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite taco shop! Being a vegetarian it can be hard to find good tacos that are filling and cater to my diet. The black beans are not cooked in lard which is preferred.  The food is so amazing and delicious. The quality of the food is consistent every time I go. The portions are large and I really feel like I am getting my money's worth. The staff is friendly and I feel like I am getting authentic Mexican food. The ingredients are always fresh and the meals are completely customizable."}
{"text":"Foods good but they're never open. Yelp says open till 8 today. Show up at 6 and the sign says they closed at 5.....on a Saturday...."}
{"text":"Good breakfast burritos til 3PM... but I only wish I had known first that they serve a breakfast BOWL.
The only bummer is that they really do not serve a Pico salsa, or any kind of substantial chunky salsa for that matter.   So when looking for extra flavor, order take out and use your own salsa I guess."}
{"text":"O man that was delicious! Green chili beef, rice, black beans; all the fixings; lettuce, pico, cilantro, jalapeño, corn, cheese, sour cream, chipotle sour cream, jalapeño cream cheese - all stuffed in a warm burrito! Perfect amount of flavor and spice. Amazing! I have been searching for a burrito place and this is currently at the top of my list! I meant to take a picture, but then I ate it all. The green hot sauce was perfect for me, red was to spicy. Went there for lunch, staff was nice and explained all options. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Wow this place is my new favorite for tacos! The red carnitas were mind blowing. I made the mistake of adding mild hot sauce to the already existing spicy red sauce and those tacos had me shook. Beware the hot sauce. Everything is hot which is a plus if you're a spicy food nut like me but if you're not tread careful. I would recommend to ANYONE."}
{"text":"Awesome food, friendly service! Told the woman making the food we found them on yelp and asked what the process of ordering food was. She walked us through it and told us all about the food and different meats, garnishes, and sauces. Everything was super fresh, and very authentic! Had the 5 street tacos all w different meats, ended up going back for more to take home. Great place! However, the water taste kinda bad which made the fountain lemonade taste weird as well, and the coke from the fountain was out of service, so I'd recommend going w a bottled beverage. Otherwise, great stuff!"}
{"text":"Wow best dang taco I have had in a long time. Salas amazing great service too what more could you ask for."}
{"text":"Was looking for a new taco spot and looked on yelp and saw this spot, I'm so glad I stopped In and tried it! The food was absolutely amazing! I loved the atmosphere and the owners where very sweet! I love supporting small business and I will absolutely be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Nice clean place, no line. Tried the 5street tacos today. Had 3 different meats, the spiciest was the best! Not hot spicy, but full flavor spicy. This is my new place !"}
{"text":"I searched YELP! for something close to my Dr's office and this gem popped up. I decided to give it a try. SO glad I did. I had the chicken rolled tacos. They threw the tacos in the fryer and placed chicken meat on the grill. When I got my food I was surprised to find the tacos stuffed with potatoes. Then they added Cheese and chicken. It didn't stop there! You had an array of ingredients you could add on top. I added cilantro, lettuce, tomato, guacamole and sour cream. They're were other ingredients to add AND I had a choice of about 7 or 8 types of meat to choose in the first place or you could go vegetarian. Add in a salsa bar and you're set. Everything on the menu looked tasty. I will be back."}
{"text":"Finally found my go to Mexican joint near work. Super friendly and helpful staff. The owner could not stress enough how fresh everything is. I think someone else on here compared it to an authentic Chipotle. 

I got the 5 street taco's and they were awesome! Only bad part about it was that I didn't have a big enough stomach to eat all of it! Lots of food for the money. 

I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place after looking at their other location yelp pages. 

Im a fan of street tacos and had yet to find someplace close that did decent ones. I was so happy when I ate these! I got the carne and canitas. Both were great. I keep them simple with cilantro and onions but tried the picked onions on some and they were good! I like spicy but man is their hot salsa really hot. Also don't be fooled by the avocado one, it too is very spicy. The mild was perfectly hot and I also liked the charred chili mix they have. 

I ordered a cheese quesadilla for my kids and was given the option of 3 small ones or one big the first time and the next visit asked how many small I'd like. They don't quite have pricing figured out on these, first time it was around $5 for the 3 and the next they were about $2 each. Still not too bad. 

The horchata is delicious as well! For sure a new favorite."}
{"text":"I had the 5 street tacos. They were amazing! You can get up to 3 different kinds. I went with the carne asada, tinga chicken, and green chili beef. I loved them all! Could not pick a favorite! Got the chips and guacamole too. She made fresh warm chips, and the guacamole was perfect! This is definitely a hidden gem! I will be a regular here!"}
{"text":"Just finished eating here. The food was amazing. Especially for the price. It's not your average Mexican chain you see on nearly every corner. The food here is fresh and the service is great. 

FOOD: it was great, had the five street tacos, a mix of carne asada and green chile tacos. BOMB! I highly recommend their \"cilantro ranch\", it made the taco even more perfect. My gf had the same with a diverse mix of meat and great as well. She added the guacamole to her tacos and it was also great. The kids had the 5 rolled tacos with chicken on top, since it was a big serving the adults ending up finishing it, no complaints on the food. 

INTERIOR: Nothing extraordinary, but definitely clean! Again, not your average taco shop you walk into. They have lucha libre wrestlers painted on the accent walls, pretty cool. On the back wall they have luchador masks hanging up. Perfect theme. 

Overall, definitely coming back to eat here next time I'm in Peoria."}
{"text":"Amazing Mexican food, and great customer service. It's a small place but very cozy, we feel like home when we are there. They will also make you a fresh smoothie if requested."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what was worse, the mediocre tacos, the cell phone sitting on the cutting board, or the lady taking the same glove on and off so she can send texts. Yummy."}
{"text":"Food was excellent and fast service. A variety of tacos and burritos. Portion size is good as well!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, soooooo good. The guac is the bomb. We tried the chicken, carnitas, and asada beef in taco and quesadilla form. All of it was incredibly flavorful and delicious. The hot sauce was awesome. Everyone was friendly, the place is way bigger in the inside than it looks from the outside, and the Mucha Lucha decor is so fun!"}
{"text":"Got the mixed fajita burrito...seriously one of the best burritos I've ever had. Originally I had only planned to eat half of it and save the rest for breakfast, but I ate it all on one sitting. Whoops. 

Aside from the amazing food, the artwork in the restaurant is amazing, and the staff is fantastic. This place is definitely on our list for \"must eat\" restaurants when we come down from Flagstaff. :)"}
{"text":"Bomb as heck! Valleys best kept secret. Surf n turf my favorite followed by hard shell tacos and street tacos. I highly recommend dropping by and giving this place your biz cause it's the best!"}
{"text":"I have no idea why we don't frequent this place more often, we love it. This was our second visit and it is as great as the first time. The choice and style of meats to choose from are exceptional. I can't get enough of the street tacos whether it be one of the varieties of pork, beef, or chicken. For truly authentic Mexican food I highly recommend Mucha Lucha. We went on a Friday night and the place was packed but not overcrowded. It's nice to not have to fight the crowds at other nearby places all the while receiving a better meal. It'd be nice to have a cerveza with the tacos but it's not a deal breaker considering the quality found here."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delicious!  The carne asada is amazing.  I love street tacos and crave them often and I was thrilled to find a taco shop close to home and taste so authentic!"}
{"text":"Great taco place in Peoria, AZ. The meat selection is novel and it is generous in portion. I highly recommend their food for a nice lunch!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend eating here! The food was amazing and the atmosphere was fun!!! 

We celebrated our daughter in laws birthday here and had a blast!  The owner greeted us and personally made sure we had a fantastic time. 

Loved the DJ and the variety of music that was played."}
{"text":"Yum!!! After having gone here twice, I can say that I'm a fan of Mucha Lucha Taco Shop! You have to check them out.

The menu at first glance seems pretty simple but they have lots of options - street tacos, regular tacos, rolled tacos, burritos, and more! They have a similar set up as Chipotle in that you pick your selection of taco, burrito, etc. then your meat and toppings. I've gotten the Tinga Chipotle chicken as my meat option both times & it has been super tasty. I liked the rolled tacos which are filled with potato & cheese and topped with meat & toppings, and also enjoyed the taco bowl with meat, beans, rice, and toppings.

The restaurant itself is small but most people seem to take the food to-go. My only note is the service between the times we went was a bit different. The first we went, they were super friendly & willing to help out (since we mentioned it was our first time at the restaurant), and were also generous with their portions of food. The next time, it was a lot busier and they seemed to want to rush through the line. I'm all one for speedy service but they weren't attentive and also a bit skimpy on the food. I had to ask for additional toppings to go on my bowl. Overall though, 4 stars for the flavors of the food! We will be back."}
{"text":"Okay so the food here is AMAZING and that's why i'm giving it 4 stars. Everything is so flavorful. I think as far as price though, it would be a $$ not $. They charge you extra for EVERYTHING here. Want a little extra cheese? That will be an extra charge. Want a tiny spoonful of guac? That will be $1.75. Want a tiny spoonful of their cream cheese jalapeno stuff? An extra $1.75. Want an extra squeeze of sour cream? Extra charge. They don't even warn you until they ring up your total and your sitting there with a $17 burrito wondering how it went from being $9 to $17. I'll still come here every once in awhile because the food is amazing. But they need to cut down on charging extra for everything."}
{"text":"Amazing Tacos! They are number one on Yelp for a reason! We got the street tacos and flour tacos. The meat is great and fresh!"}
{"text":"Mucha Lucha is is a great addition to Gilbert!  My husband loves the shrimp street tacos.  The quesadillas are so delicious, nachos are good too.  Their sauces are very spicy, which my hubby loves.  If there is a line you might be there for awhile since everything is cooked to order and you can add any toppings.  Great people that work there,  check it out."}
{"text":"Having visited the Most Wanted Taco on several occasions, I thoroughly enjoyed  their menu.

Very recently my son and I thought we would drop by for a quick bite and unfortunately this restaurant is under new management (?). Most Wanted is no more. 

The new restaurant is Very unorganized and needs to get their act together.

We were extremely disappointed with the fish tacos. Cold tortillas and hard to find the few Very small pieces of fried fish with all the extras. And yes, those extras, such a very small serving of guacamole and sour cream etc. were all priced as extras.  $34.xx for 6 tacos with no sides. Wow. Not much of a deal there.
Pricey for what we got. 

Will pass on a return visit."}
{"text":"Simple, delicious tacos and burritos. I'm a big fan of the fish and shrimp tacos, and my husband can't get enough of the fajita burrito, wet style. The staff is super nice and friendly too. All in all, love this place!"}
{"text":"Food here is incredible!!!! Get the tacos, any kind. Flavor is fresh and unbeatable. Best taco place around. Cheap and delicious. Also great horchata!"}
{"text":"Muy delicioso!!!
This place makes the best tacos in town. Owners are usually there which adds a great authentic flavor to the place. The decor is also pretty cool. This is the only place in town to go for real Mexican food."}
{"text":"Closed today, no sign, no explanation. Noon on Saturday. 9/23.  This is not the first time. I can't commit to a place that doesn't have consistent business hours."}
{"text":"Mouth watering, spicy, hot, sweet flavors paired with Mexican wrestler art decor makes for a five star experience. 

I wanted to go back for more!  The burritos truly stand head and shoulders above the normal Mexican place.  

I tried the \"El Jefe\" burrito which was amazing.  Think of a giant steak omelette covered with cheese and onions then wrapped inside a tortilla.  Every member of my part completely enjoyed their selection from this loco good menu. 

The location is also decorated colorfully and the staff is friendly and helpful.  The women behind the counter told us to \"go ahead and eat and pay later\" so we could enjoy our food hot.   I'll be back anytime I'm in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Damn! Tacos were damn good! Coming from LA where nearly all taco spots is on point, this place does not disappoint. Taco meat selection is awesome don't all tasty! And let's not forget the extra spicy salsa!"}
{"text":"Had awesome tostadas the carne asada and barbacoa.. add the cream! Great Mexican food. Quick and easy."}
{"text":"The best fish tacos I've ever had! Not deep fried fish. Cooked on flat top. The avocado salsa was really hot for my liking. All in all, a great place! Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I was told about this place food is awesome!!  must try!! Lots to choose from and many Salsa's to choose from."}
{"text":"5/5 for food and 5/5 for service. A great experience! 

Food: Huge portions, and everyone was really happy with what they got. The verde salsa is pretty darn spicy - in the group we went with, I was the only one who didn't think it was too spicy. We got a verde carnitas wet burrito, verde wet burrito el pastor, verde fajita mix wet burrito, carne asada breakfast burrito (the only one we got that wasn't wet), and another wet burrito, rojo (I can't remember the meats!). Everyone was really happy with their meals, and two of us couldn't finish. I had half a burrito left for my next meal! Everything was delicious, and we'll be going back for sure.

Service: Very friendly. We weren't the only people in there, but all of the staff were very kind to us and took the time to get our orders right. They seemed happy to see us, and we felt welcomed.

Worthy of note: You can't see anything in the bathroom - there's one blacklight bulb in there, but be prepared with your phone light or something. It's fun and trippy, but also a little frustrating."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic little place. Great food. Always busy. The burritos are huge. Made right before your eyes. Fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"That food was amazing. Fish tacos hit the spot. Don't forget to squeeze the lime! Everything I wanted it to be, so delicious. I wish I could take this restaurant to Michigan! The churros were the perfect treat and the cookies melt in your mouth. Very authentic, and very filling. Thanks Mucha Lucha!"}
{"text":"This place is a winner, and they'll make just about anything you want.  All of their tacos are good, especially the shrimp.  Massive Burritos as big as your head.  Three people absolutely busting their asses during the lunch rush is quite impressive to watch.  Amazing how quick they kick the food out when the heat is on.  Everything is on a steam table for your viewing, and cold toppings on the other side!  I really like this place not only because it's in my area, but mainly because I truly respect a small business with low overhead, that's doing their best...Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing!! Best street tacos I've ever tasted! Real authentic Mexican food. They even offered to let us sample the meat. My favorite is the spicy green chili beef, but everything we ordered was delicious. I love the atmosphere, music, and the staff was very friendly. We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"I just finished eating the most delicious green chile wet burrito. So savory and the sauce that is poured over tastes like an enchilada sauce (yum). My husband had the meat lovers taco platter and he said they were great! We will definitely order from here again!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and food! The employees were very helpful and accommodating. I had the chicken super nachos with black beans, pico, and guac. I added jalapeño cheese and it made my nachos even more tasty. I also overheard the owner saying something about churros so I got a cream filled chuuro that was amazing. 
We went on a rainy day so there was no outside furniture but when there is, they say pets are allowed and that is AWESOME."}
{"text":"Food was good but nothing special. I personally wouldn't come back but overall, food was good. If you're in the area and hungry then try it out"}
{"text":"Amazing!

Mucha Lucha is an awesome quick bite. The street tacos are small but mighty and their picante stuff really packs a punch. The food was fresh and made to order. Staff was very friendly and offered samples. I would recommend and we will be going back! I will say that the music is loud, but that doesn't bother me!"}
{"text":"I went in a stood at the counter and waited and waited for someone to help me. The workers stayed in the back talking to each other, two were sitting at a table talking and socializing, and another worker went outside to her car when I walked in. Got tired of being ignored so I went the gyro place a few shops down and had a great dinner. They saw me standing there and kept having their conversations and I felt like I'd be rude if I had interrupted. Really bad service."}
{"text":"I had the bandera Chicken burrito. It was excellent! Has great flavor and was filling. Restaurant itself isn't very big but there are tables for dining in. If you want the street tacos they only allow 2 different options for the 5 tacos. Other than that it was great"}
{"text":"Excellent reasonably priced, authentic, simple Mexican food in a casual store front location. We had the shrimp tacos and wet carne asada burrito. Both excellent."}
{"text":"Honestly just updating this review to include the fact that I constantly crave this food. When I think about all of the other options out there, I can't believe I thought any of them were good. 

YUM!! I visit Rocky Point often and I loved going into this restaurant and feeling like it was authentic. The food is fantastic and they were super nice to me when I had no clue where to start ordering. 
Definitely will be my new lunch spot! I built my own carne asada burrito. So good."}
{"text":"This place was a great stop for lunch...they cooked our food fresh and everyone enjoyed what they had...no frills no thrills but definitely tasty!...love the pics of the wrestlers on the wall...nice touch...it was hot in here though...maybe turn the ac up??...food definitely worth the stop!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here while waiting to get my haircut next door- figured I'd get a quick bite. I had their 3 taco platter. 

They make their food fresh, they grilled the meat and fry fry their tortillas right in front of you. You then pick your toppings and you're good to go. 

I'd come back for lunch again."}
{"text":"Mucha Lucha has multiple locations and they all have high reviews so I thought I would give it a try. I was at Paradise Valley Mall & they have a shop in the food court.

From first glance, all of the prices are relatively high and the place does not seem very modern. I decided to order the 5 Street Taco Plate. I ordered 2 Carne Asada, 2 Tinga Chicken, and 1 Barbacoa. They have a fast casual style so you can see their whole process of preparing the food.

I already knew I was in for some not so great tacos just by watching the process and seeing the amount of food I was given. Each taco could be consumed in 1 bite. 

I am very disappointed and will not be returning."}
{"text":"Amazing street tacos!!  A fantastic little mom & pop joint.  Chips & guacamole were phenomenal. If you're looking for an authentic Mexican place with a small & quiet atmosphere, this is it!  Definitely will be a repeat customer when we come back to Phoenix.  Love it!"}
{"text":"I got the 5 street tacos, you can choose from many types of meat and toppings. My food was great and cheap too! There's many things to choose from on the menu, tacos, burritos, nachos, quesadillas, they even have a breakfast menu! It's a small family owned restaurant and they were super friendly. We will definitely be going back some time soon! 

The only thing I would say was not so great is that they close at 8, I wish they were open a little later."}
{"text":"Amazing resturaunt. Their food tastes absolutely delicious, and the employees are so nice & helpful. I always have a great experience when I go to Mucha Lucha."}
{"text":"I Yelped for tacos near my house. Pleasantly surprised. 5 street tacos for $7.49. Choice of meats and toppings are right in front of you. Carne Asada and Barbacoa were good. I also tried the plain carnitas.  Not full of flavor on its own but the salsas and toppings fixed it up. Speaking of the salsas, they were fantastic!!  I hope you like hot because they were, especially the avocado. Yum!!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Best taco's I've ever had, no doubt.  Lot's of food for the money, a must try if you're in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I've been to 4 different locations in the East Valley because this place is awesome. This location just opened about a month ago."}
{"text":"This place has the best fish tacos.  The fish is cooked fresh on the grill, not breaded and fried.  We always choose corn tortillas.  The fish is so good, it doesn't need many toppings.  The place is always busy at meal times."}
{"text":"A step up from Chipotle: if you are looking for a great Mexican meal and great service I recommend this restaurant! I have been a returning customer since they opened and never once have I been disappointed. Thank you for awesome service and spectacular food keep it up!"}
{"text":"Great find in of all places a mall.  Nice assortment of meat choices with interesting flavors.  Fresh toppings.  Worth the trip to the food court at PV Mall.  Ole'"}
{"text":"Best tacos on my side of town. I only go for the tacos. Tried other things and they were ok. I've been here at least 20 times for tacos."}
{"text":"Took my family here, hoping for authentic family friendly Mexican food and tacos! WOW IT WAS FANTASTIC - go there now but get in line behind us!!! Lol!"}
{"text":"Fantastic fresh Mexican food.  A simple suite houses one of the best taco shops I've been to.  I had the street tacos:  carnitas, carne asada, chipotle chicken.  I liked the carnitas the best.  My sons split a carnitas open burrito.  The rice and beans were fresh and delicious.  The meats are heated on the flat top."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT! Went for dinner, got macho nachos and the S.O. got a breakfast burrito. We went with another couple, who got tacos and a burrito. The food was super tasty and the portions were quite generous. My portion of nachos was so large that I took home half for lunch the next day. Everyone said their food was excellent. We were some of the last patrons in that evening and we accidentally stayed a little past their closing time (ten mins). The staff was very kind and did not make a big stink of closing. They quietly locked the door and kindly let us out once we finished. The four of us were so engrossed in our food that we didn't notice the time.
YUMMY food, great portions for the price. We will certainly be back."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time a few days ago. I was skeptical at first. When we went in we noticed it was a very clean place and friendly staff. I ordered the surf and turf burrito it was excellent. They have a delicious cream cheese sauce. I got the guacamole salsa, it was a little too spicy for me but that's typical. I will be back!"}
{"text":"First time there today and it is seriously yummy! We had carne asada street tacos, carne asada mucho fries, and a wet barbacoa burrito. The fries were delicious and my picky kids gobbled up the street tacos with no complaints. I shared the burrito with my husband and it was delicious and the meat was well seasoned. The portions are generous and prices are very affordable. The food is customizable and fresh. Beats any of the 'bertos and priced similar if not even better.

Just a warning that the red sauce they put on the wet burrito is very spicy so if that's not your thing be warned. I'm trying the green sauce next time as the heat was a bit overwhelming for me. My husband loves a lot of spice and he loved the sauce so it's more of a personal taste thing.

I do wish they had a real water machine though with ice. They just have a dispenser with ice water in it."}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot for street tacos! I come here almost once a week, I'm addicted to those tacos! I love the variety of meats to choose from and that you can switch it up. The green chili is my favorite! There is a guy who works there every time I go in, maybe the owner or manager, but he works hard to provide a great experience! The tortillas are also amazing, and the food is always fresh."}
{"text":"We ordered a pick up order and it said it was being prepared and would be ready for pick up between 5:08 and 5:30 so we headed over to pick it up. As I parked in the spot at 5:25 I saw someone peek out from the back kitchen and see us. I noticed the Saigon said closed so I called to make sure my order would be available or that they would be opening soon. After calling multiple times and checking the door, no one answered so I cancelled my order. It would have been nice if the order would have just been denied or if we had at least been alerted to this random closure before ordering."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good, friendly service and good food, but I feel some of the sauces and salsas are overly spicy. I have a high heat tolerance and some of their sauces were so hot they numbed my mouth and made my stomach sick. Youch! Nothing needs to be that hot... As long as you go with something MILD from here you'll probably be just fine. I'd recommend either the Carne Asada Fries or the Quesadilla, both are very good and healthy portions as well. I'll definitely give this place another try some time but I'll use caution!"}
{"text":"Close to home. Very big burritos. It is organized like a subway . You tell them what you want in your burrito and how much you want. There is lot to pick from. Onions, cheese, peppers, sour cream, rice, bean, salad, and more!  They have several variations of meat. And a lot of good hot sauce, which are actually hot. $6.99 for a meat burrito. You will get more than you pay for! It is tasty!!"}
{"text":"Wow! Delicious, great service, great portion sizes, reasonable prices, and did I mention just delicious? I am really impressed. I got the Bandera Wet Burrito with Shrimp Fajitas and they really cooked it up right in front of me and loaded it up with everything I wanted in it. On top they put a green sauce (which had a little kick) and red sauce, cheese, sour cream, and guacamole. It was the bomb!

My husband got the macho fries with green chili chicken. He said they were very good and that he enjoyed them very much and he's a picky Mexican when it comes to Mexican food. Two thumbs up, five stars all the way!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. I ordered the \"El Jefe\" burrito and when I saw them put the ingredients (chorizo, carne asada, bacon, egg, cheese, beans, rice) onto the grill, I assumed that they were making several.  To my amazement, it was ALL for my burrito (I'm still amazed that they crammed all of that into a tortilla).  Great taste, and beware: they are NOT messing around with the salsa!  I got the green tomatillo which I assumed was mild, and upon grabbing a big dip onto my chip, flew into a coughing/sneezing fit (in a good way). :)"}
{"text":"Always great, had the street tacos with and old style Coke a cola glass bottle and it was awesome. Family business always friendly and willing to create any combination for you. Plenty items to choose from and the service it pretty much made to order. Try the green chili beef.... Nice and spicy"}
{"text":"Unexpected surprise in a strip mall! Set up like Chipotle but with more authentic flavors and options. Everything is super fresh and homemade. You can tell that the people who own the restaurant take a lot of pride in what they do. Best of all if you like spicy food...I mean really spicy! They have a few things there that will melt your face off."}
{"text":"If you are able to, get over here and try this place!!!! We were really surprised and impressed with the awesome food here. The sauces are super hot if you want. Street tacos and burritos were amazing!!!"}
{"text":"These are some of the best tacos I've had.  I'll definitely be back to try the rest of the menu. Didn't even know this place was there until I randomly saw it and decided to stop in. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos, burritos, and nachos!!! 

Got the bandera burrito with chicken, asada nachos, and grilled fish tacos. Everything tastes amazing! 

Great food, great service, great atmosphere. 

It made us all \"Muchas\" happy"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I've found locally in a while! All of the meat options sampled were great, and I ordered beef barbacoa wet burrito which was delicious (and the size of two meals)! The topping/filling options are plentiful! The red sauce atop the wet burrito as well as the hottest salsa options are INDEED spicy (as I love it!) so be aware of that if you're sensitive to the heat. And to top it off, the decor is adorable and the staff amazingly friendly and helpful! Can't wait to try the breakfast items next time!"}
{"text":"Faaaabulous! Must try street tacos! Yummy!!! We tried a mix of all the different meats and the flavors were to die for! Mmmmm"}
{"text":"Hands down best mexican place in the east valley. Ive eaten here several times and the food is consistently awesome. My favorite is the wet burrito with the red carnitas. It has a kick so if you like spicy, this is for you. The pork is cooked perfectly and very flavorful. Throw on the pickled onions, cilantro, tomatoes, cheese and guac and its flavor explosion. Lots of add on sauces and peppers at the sidebar. Reasonable prices too. Cant beat it. You gotta eat here."}
{"text":"I almost hate to do 5 stars because it might drag in more people and make me wait.  Best tacos I've had in the east valley."}
{"text":"Good tacos and food tastes fresh! It is the deconstructed meal that I enjoy here. It feels like a mom and pop restaurant with some fun decorations on the wall. I also like the fact that they are not afraid to get a little spicy."}
{"text":"My first trip into Mucha Lucha was so damn expensive I don't think I can afford to go back. I dont get enough allowance.  Their carne asada fries were so small I ordered a second  plus a horchata, I was at $23 buck's, fuck that. Forgive my language,( Mom and Dad will spank me on this one.)


Really?  2 orders of carne asada fries and horchata and I'm at $23 bucks and my second order had half the meat of my first order? that's bullshit. Daddy taught me better.

 Mommy and daddy couldn't even get full because I ate the carne asada fries, but mommy ordered five tacos and they were tasty.

Daddy did say the quality of the meat was excellent, no mystery meat, no spitting out chewy rubber band crap. However the carne asada was chopped so small it was very difficult to identify it as meat.

The fries are a seasoned Ore-Ida type fries not your typical crap shoestring fries.

They charge extra for guacamole, that was bullshit.

The salsa bar was lacking and mislabeled I couldn't tell what the hell I was having No pico de gallo, no spicy carrots, but then what do I know.

They offered me rice and beans on my carne asada fries, are you fucking ikidding me?

To review the quality of meat, was very good but their portions are small and thei
r extra charge for guacamole, fuck it, I'll go elsewhere.

To sum up, $9 for a half order carne asada fries and $2.50 horchata, I don't make enough allowance, ill.save my money.

Quality of food is 4 stars or better.
Value for your allowance is minus 2.

I'll ride my bike to Tacos de Tijuana on 67th Avenue and Thunderbird next time. At least I can get full for $9."}
{"text":"We stopped in here based on the Yelp reviews-it did NOT disappoint!  All four of us ordered something different all was DELICIOUS!  Service was quick, staff was friendly!  -plates are made FRESH right in front of you.  Definitely found a new Taco shop!"}
{"text":"Ugh. The beef fajita was fatty and chewy. They don't carry the green chicken fajita like their other locations and the staff spent more time talking to eachother than taking customer orders. There are too many other options. Skip mucha lucha"}
{"text":"This place is good. Surf and Turf burrito is the bomb dot com! Steak tacos are also a hit. Fresh, toppings and salsa made in house."}
{"text":"Very popular taco shop. They have a good selection of several types of meat marinated in different sauces/spices.  Very flavorful food."}
{"text":"Best. Tacos. Ever. Their quesadilla is really good too.  They seem to close whenever they feel like, so make sure you call ahead."}
{"text":"5 street tacos is where its at.  May have to parlay 5 tacos into 10 just to try them all.
of course not all will be winners depending on your taste in tacos, but try them all.

word."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. The street tacos are on point and hit the spot on a Friday night. My favorite is the surf n turf taco that come with a jalapeños cream cheese sauce. The staff is friendly and the music and luchador theme puts a smile on my face every time I go!"}
{"text":"I work on an ambulance so I'm constantly driving around the valley looking for fun little eat shops everywhere and my medic partner said to come here and I was not disappointed! I got the 5 street tacos, chose 3 different meats, carnitas asada was good, there Barbacoa was okay...... but there spicy chicken. The spicy shredded chicken was AMAZEBALLS!! I would have gotten all 5 of the chicken if I knew better. They had some jalepeno cream sauce my partner said was good but I was told after I got my meal and ate it so I can't say iv had it. I got guac on the side and it was above your average guac. Customer service was great, very friendly, very polite. I spent almost 10$ on 5 street tacos with guac, so it was a little pricey for tacos, but worth it."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area. Fantastic Mexican food. Do yourself a favor and have the chicken. It shredded and so juicy and tender. It was fantastic. On top of that they have a whole variety of sauces. It was fantastic. Great job"}
{"text":"Tonight is my 2nd time at Mucha Lucha! So impressed with the food and service both times. Started with carne asada tacos and finished with chicken tacos which were both amazing. The owner Alfredo even came out at the end of the meal just to make sure everything was great. Live band for Cinco De Mayo! 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"When he asks for a different chain, and you end up consulting yelp and find a gem, it's always a good thing.  I really enjoyed the sopes with tinga chicken, while the fam loves their red carnitas wet burrito and classic asada quesadilla. Finish it off with a Mexican Coke in a bottle, and it's a new fave we'll  be heading back to soon. Hoping their other locations are just as good."}
{"text":"First time here, and was very impressed. The food was great, and the staff were very nice! Carne Asada hard-shell tacos were delicious. Can't wait to go back!

If you are a fan of spicy sauce (I am) try the \"Very Hot\" green sauce! Flavor was on point and it was enough to make me sweat while still being able to taste the flavor!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our food here! It's a great price and such a variety of meats and toppings. The staff was also very friendly. We have a ten month old and they offered to go get her an avocado and mash it for her! We came right before closing time and they seemed to have had a long day, but still handled everything very politely. Definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"Mucha Lucha is AWESOME! They have a ton of options so everybody can find something they like. They are unlike any other taco shop I've been to in AZ. Their flavors are unlike anybody else and reasonably priced.  I go there every couple weeks for tacos and I can't say that for a lot of Mexican restaurants."}
{"text":"Good tacos and well priced although there aren't many people working behind the counter so it can take a minute depending on how busy they are. I definitely recommend trying the jalepeno cream cheese, yummy!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  Had the carne asada and it was lean & delicious.  Up there with the best I have had.  The kids had chicken taco and burrito and ate it all!  Watch out there salsas are spicy but very flavorful.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Everyone, you have to try this place out. Like, wow, this place is amazing! The food was outstanding! They have a solid menu that is straightforward and easy to understand.

The inside is fairly small with a few tables here and there. Their employees were nice and courteous. The restaurant with relatively clean as well.

They seemed inefficient when it comes to making the food. The employees were running back and forth a lot and didn't seem to be following any process. Four of us came in and it literally made the ordering process almost halt. Shortly after that 4 more people came in and it look them even longer to make my food. I had to wait quite awhile till I found finally eat

Overall, I really liked this place and would recommend it to everyone to try out at least once. I really hope they can work out getting the food made in a more timely manner."}
{"text":"Food here is awesome , service was fabulous and place nice and tidy... I'll be back here for sure. The prices are reasonable to. That burrito was huge!!!... Muchos gracias!!! Yeeeha!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Did not expect how good it was!!!! honestly thought it was going to be nasty, but it was the opposite!!!! i would recommend to everyone, i plan on going back"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't been to Mucha Lucha until now. Wow, what a gem. Authentic Mexican food to the max. I ordered 3 tacos, all a different meat. One of the employees working had given me her recommendations. She was spot on. I will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Very Clean, inexpensive  Restaurant. Very helpful staff. They take the build-your-own taco concept to a whole new level with several meat choices and fixings. I highly recommend the beef in green chilli taco. This spicy beef is tender and flavourful. And for the spicy lovers, you must try the Habineros sauce."}
{"text":"NO AC. Just warning. It was 97 degrees outside. It was good. Good portions and good price. I would still prefer backyard taco."}
{"text":"I ordered Mucha Lucha to go which ended up being a huge mistake despite living around the corner.  The nachos became soggy and the wet burrito leaked everywhere.  One gentleman had to take the order and do all of the cooking himself, so the end product is entirely dependent on this man's skill and attentiveness.  The food was ok, but not worth the price or wait.  I'm still in search of a good Mexican place in Gilbert."}
{"text":"Ordered the 5 Mini Tacos, Carne Asada, w/ Avo. Food was delicious dont get me wrong, cool little environment, nice staff. However, would have given 5 stars if i hadnt had to pay nearly $10 for just that alone. Paid extra for avocado on my tacos, which was really just a small spoon scoop in the center of them all. Coming from San Diego, $10 for this was funny to me. Food was great, just not worth paying $10. Sorry."}
{"text":"The 5 street tacos is the perfect amount. I scarfed it down and enjoyed every bite.  I can't recommend this place enough.  I wish I had one of these restaurants back home near me... maybe someday.."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican place in Gilbert!  I only had the wet burrito, but I've had every meat choice and they have all been delicious!  My next must try is the breakfast bowl.  

The restaurant is small.  Maybe 4 or 5 tables?  I have not eaten inside the restaurant.  I usually swing by on my way home from work.  They are fast and friendly, perfect when you want to get home after a long day at work."}
{"text":"Excellent. Just so good!!! The carne asada was grilled fresh. You will love it!"}
{"text":"I just had the wet burrito and it was delicious! I tried the barbacoa with the red sauce and it was amazing. They have a large variety of meats and meals. Next time I'm trying the 5 street taco deal. Thanks for the great food and service!"}
{"text":"Stopped in and ordered the carne asada street tacos and they were amazing. You can add cheese,pico de gallo, lettuce, and other yummy toppings aside from the standard onions and cilantro. The staff were friendly and service excellent. This place is a must try if your in need for some delicious tacos."}
{"text":"Pretty good. Got hyped from all the pics but there is a ton of flies everywhere which makes it a turn off from eating all the open food."}
{"text":"Great taste! Had the nachos, bowl and the little one had a quesadilla! I guess it was a huge hit!"}
{"text":"Tinga chicken tacodilla's are where it's at!!! The food is always super fresh and really flavorful! You have to try it out."}
{"text":"Soooo good!! It's a chipotle setup but authentic Mexican food. Way more meat options. Ps when they say spicy meat, they mean it. I'm hooked on the place!!!"}
{"text":"Food was super oily. Food tasted kind of bland. Nothing special. Nice employees though."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous! Soooooooo good!

This is a hidden gem that has been a 5-star experience every time I go there. I go at least once a week and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I found this place to get Mexican food in the area. This is most definitely authentic Mexican - tried the 5 street tacos & 3 shrimp tacos both were extremely flavorful and tasty. I also liked how they had various options to customize tacos including a choice of sauces depending on how spicy. The art on the wall was cool and does add character to the taco shop.

This is an easy recommendation for good Mexican food in the South Scottsdale area. I plan on returning here on occasion and to bring my friends next time!"}
{"text":"The real deal. Just a little hole in the wall with delicious food and super friendly service. Carne asada and horchata are my faves! Here at least once a week!"}
{"text":"I went with four stars for only one flaw, the menu is confusing and not accommodating for their \"premium or special\" taco meats like the fried fish or shrimp tacos. I wanted to try one fish taco and one of another kind but if you get a premium meat you can't mix and match you have to get 2 or 3 of the same. So, I chose some meats off the standard menu and was very happy with them. Delicious green chile shredded beef and a carne asada steak taco. We also had the street tacos, red chicken and steak, super good. We will definitely be back! Also has a steak quesadilla and it was very good."}
{"text":"Finally went to check this place out only to find a sign on the door that said it's closed today and tomorrow (Friday and Saturday)! I can only assume a family owned business needed a weekend off? I'll update my review once I can get thu the front door."}
{"text":"What an awesome addition to Peoria! I am in love with the rolled tacos! Friendly staff, clean and wonderful food!"}
{"text":"First of all!!!
The ambience is super cool!!
It's a Lucha Libre Theme. The dining room has Luchadores paintings and pictures. That alone wins my heart.
The food???  Amazing!!!
It's a taco shop, so of course, I ordered the street tacos. I got asada, green chile, spicy red  chicken, and pork.  The meats were juicy and so effing delicious. They have a small salsa bar with this serrano peppers mix that was spicy and my favorite since I love serrano peppers.  The guy working here (not sure if he's the owner) recommended this guac sauce thing that was bomb. 
Highly satisfied.  If you're in the area seriously try this place. 
I found this place doing some work up in this part of town. It's totally a date night joint.
I will most definitely return."}
{"text":"The tacos were super good, the hot sauce was HOT! Wished there was one closer to my house!!"}
{"text":"We drove by a few times and didn't think much about it. Another taco place popping up so we thought. Mistake. It's the best taco place we have been ever. It's the closest it gets to a typical  \"around the corner\" taco place in any given Mexican town. Real ingredients. Our new favorite place. No more Cafe Rio, Chipotle or Costa Vida. Why go to the imitators when you can go to the real thing? And the staff was very friendly. 100% positive experience :)"}
{"text":"A lot of options here, so tried 5 different meats on my street tacos. Great salsa, good spicy levels and the owner was so friendly! I eat a lot of Mexican food and this is one of the best I've had!"}
{"text":"Excellent!!! MUST eat here. Real authentic, delicious, and home made right in front of you!!!

Loved it and so did my four year old! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The best street tacos in Gilbert. Very small inside so while we were there most customers took their food to go. Many choices of meats and toppings and you can sample the meat as some are very spicy. We also tried their tostadas. Scrumptious. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Heard there was (another) new place in the food court at the PV Mall...turns out there were two.

There is a new Vietnamese place where McDonalds used to be (no Bun and no Cafe Sua Da = no deal), so we decided to try Mucha Lucha Taco Shop.

Ordered the 5 Street Tacos and asked for one of each of your favorite 5 - ended up with Carne Asada, Green Chile, Barbacoa, Red Carnitas and Tinga Chicken.  They were all pretty good (though either the Carne Asada or the Barbacoa (hard to keep them all straight) tasted mostly of salt).  She told me the Tinga chicken would be spicy (it was, but not a lot) and she suggested leaving the hot salsa off of the Green Chile, because it was spicy (it was - pretty hot).

Also got a Jarritos Lime drink - pretty good.

This is probably my favorite food court restaurant at this point, so I bumped them up a star as being 'best in the area'.  :-)

Give 'em a try 

(and best of luck to the new taco joint at the mall!!!  we'll be back!)"}
{"text":"I went there last night for the first time, WOW! Service was excellent and so was the food. My husband and I were pleased and definately will be back..."}
{"text":"Best tacos we have had in Arizona. We have lived here 7 weeks and have been here 7 times. The workers and owner are so extremely sweet and welcoming. Price is a little higher than basic taco shops. However theres a simple reason for it. The food is super fresh and great quality. Trust me that most places used canned beef and low quality everything. Food is seasoned perfectly."}
{"text":"Love this place. Been here three times this week. Granted, I need to go grocery shopping, but still :)"}
{"text":"We ordered the green chili beef burrito. With cilantro, cheese, onions, roasted corn, pinto beans, sour cream and chipotle sauce. It was so big, we decided to split it. But that gave us the chance to order a side of chips and jalapeño cream cheese dip, excellent.
They were very courteous as we were deciding, even let us taste test the different meats. We like the green chili beef the best, but all the others were good too.
The salsa bar was full, we tried the extra hot, and it was extra hot, very good.
Mucha Lucas in Spanish means lots of wrestling. You'll see wrestling masks and Mexican wrestlers on the wall art. Very cool."}
{"text":"I was recommended to this shop a couple of months ago, i finally stopped in today and was amazingly greeted right when i stepped in the door , i ordered the super nachos with the Carne Asada and it was extremely fantastic, i look forward to coming to Mucha Lucha more often."}
{"text":"A hidden gem. Best Mexican food I've had in a very longtime. Food cooked fresh daily by the wife, and she knows how to cook. This is our 5th time here and it has been consistance. Love the famy atmosphere. The place is spotless and it smells like heaven when you walk in. They make the best Pozole in the weekend. You have to try it, you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Since leaving my first review of one star, I returned to this restaurant and when they were open, their customer service was very engaging and their food was really good.

Wish I could offer a rating for their food, however we went to pick up an order to go, at 7:45, knowing they close at 8 pm.... 

They were closed early and the employees could be seen hanging out in the back, 1 was sitting on the counter using his phone.

We'd been wanting to go here as a result of their recent ratings, however it appears that customer service is becoming less important."}
{"text":"Always great service and food. The owner really takes the time to know her customers. If you want to feel like that regular customer that the chef knows exactly what you want, go here."}
{"text":"Great service (the entitled dude in front of me trying to explain each item to someone on the phone while holding up the entire line was treated with a lot of patience) I had the 3 hard tacos - WARNING, the green chile beef is VERY hot.  This is no cafe rio green chile beef, people  - it's real green chile!   It's very good though.  I gave it a 4 because the prices are a few dollars per plate more than I think they should be.  But, I will be back."}
{"text":"Alfredo was a great help. I had never been there so He made me a sample platter to help me make my choice....Let me say, it didn't help. Every flavor was SO GOOD. it actually made the choice even harder. AMAZING!!"}
{"text":"The Tacos have a great flavor and salsas are HOT! Although, I did not try the burritos they look delicious and huge. By far the best tacos on this side of town."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best taco places I have visited.  Their 5 street tacos with chicken and carne best meat ever ! This is definitely a place I would recommend and come back to when I come back to visit sunny AZ"}
{"text":"This place is delicious . The portions are plenty and the food is spicy . I suggest you come hungry or plan on taking home leftovers. The place is clean and the staff is vey friendly. I like that they offer delivery and it's close to home. You will definitely not be left hungry at this place."}
{"text":"I'd love to wax poetic about Mucha Lucha, but truthfully here's what I loved most: fast, fresh, friendly and DELICIOUS. This is a hidden gem in south Scottsdale. Seek it out; I guarantee you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Really good street tacos and quesadillas. Very authentic, delicious, and the store is bigger than it looks"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! They are new so working out the kinks, but great place to kill your appetite. They have a little bit of a taco truck feel but have great dine-in facilities. The food was so tasty and everything was fresh when we ordered. The refried beans were made fresh in front of you as all the other meats and add-ins. The staff was ridiculously friendly and made you feel like one of their own. The prices were very reasonable and with the taste I would have paid more, completely worth every bite. Glad this place opened up!"}
{"text":"We thought the food was mediocre and the prices high.  We also stoped by one time during business hours and they were closed."}
{"text":"This place is legit. Good size portions and good price. You really can't go wrong, one caveat is that their primary meat is pork, which is correct and cool if you like pork, but I can see it being a problem with some ppl. Clean and friendly staff. Disco bathroom. Cool art. Cool place"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for lunch this past Sunday. The portions are huge, we both got the wet burrito. The meat was flavorful (I had plain carnitas, he had the chipotle chicken), and the sauce on top had a nice kick. You can definitely get away with 2 people sharing 1 burrito. We will be coming back!"}
{"text":"I got to say Carne asada burrito was bomb and huge . Big difference to other restaurants. Great seasoning and many other items on the menu are tasteful. The surf and turf and fajita mix you got to try!"}
{"text":"This is one of my go to Mexican restaurants! Food is great and the people that work here are even better, always so nice and helpful. They have my favorite salsa too, it has allot of kick to it .."}
{"text":"I've been to both the Broadway and Gilbert Mucha Lucha shops and loved every visit. There are many options as far as meat (asada, green chile and barbacoa beef, chipotle, vinagrette and red chicken, plain and red carnitas) and all are excellent so far...vegetarian option too...food tends to be a bit on the spicy side, but that's the way i like it"}
{"text":"Best shrimp burrito, best fish tacos, best el pastor street tacos.. Friendly service and great food.. you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"So delicious.  The rolled tacos are amazing.  My favorite meats are the carnitas, the red carnitas, and the carne asada.  All the toppings are on point, especially the jalapeno sour cream! YUM!"}
{"text":"We stopped in tonight to get dinner-to-go for the family and a couple of friends and the food was amazing!  The service was also very good - all in all it is a wonderful little place and this will be my go-to taco shop from now on.  
We tried a variety of burrito bowls and street tacos tonight - I can't wait to go back and try the seafood!"}
{"text":"I came to try the tacos here especially from the review aswell as being a big fan of tacos. I think there food is not that bad, but taste a little bit old. I ordered the 5 street tacos,choose 2 asada 2 tinga chicken 1 barbacoa , in all true honesty the quantity is the less ive seen and eaten of any of the taco shop in az that ive been too. Not to mention the $1.50 charge of guacamole for basicly an empty taco, dont get me wrong avocado is expensive but it almost feel like they dont care about the customer and just want the money. All in all i wouldnt come here again i would prefer other taco shops than this one."}
{"text":"This. Place. Is. Awesome!   

You have to go. It really is fabulous!  Simple order at the counter type of place but the flavor options and meat is so so so good!!!!  It's tucked away in a little strip mall so be on the lookout as you try to find it. We almost drove past the first time. We had one of each meat street taco they had. This is officially my new favorite local taco shop. 

NOM!  You must try it."}
{"text":"A Yelp treasure.  Exactly what we needed when we thought real Mexican.  Bandera wet burrito was 10/10"}
{"text":"Omg way better than backyard taco like way better omg all I've had so far was the 5 street tacos it's a lot cheaper than backyard taco and a lot tastier lol"}
{"text":"Been here a couple times now and everything is amazing!! The meat is so good and high quality! Spicy without taking anything away from the flavor. It's definitely my new go to Mexican place."}
{"text":"The food here is quite tasty!  I actually ate it all before I even remembered to take a picture. If you plan on going for lunch you'll definitely want to go early or you'll be waiting in a very long line. 

I got the burrito bowl w/ asada and original carnitas. Compared to chipotle the bowl is a little smaller but still a great filing size. You can either get the tortilla on the side or chips with your purchase. I decided on the tortilla. It was very fresh, not the kind you can just get from the store.   Don't hesitate to give this place a try."}
{"text":"The people that run this spot are super friendly.  Great meat options and gotta love being able to get a taco or burrito, both options have great flavor. And if you are looking fir a wrestlers mask, they even have a few options to sale."}
{"text":"Found this little hidden gem on my way home from the car dealership. It's tucked away in the corner. Well worth the stop. I ordered street tacos with barbacoa and carne asada. Delicious!"}
{"text":"this place has great Mexican food.  it's family owned which i like too. the street tacos are awesome and they have a ton of options that let you customize it all to how you like it. it is a little hard to find this location as it is tucked at the back of the complex.  Trust the directions and give this place a chance.  you'll be happy you did!"}
{"text":"This place is so GOOD! If you are in the mood for some real authentic Mexican food then you gotta give Mucha Lucha a try. I decided to go with the 5 Street Tacos and man was I amazed after the first taco. I went with the Tinga Chicken, Green Chili Beef and the Carne Asada steak. It felt like each meat was bursting with flavor. Don't even get me started on the toppings which seem to be endless selection from salsas vegetables and dressings. Everything has a sense of freshness you can really tell that everything was made that day. If you are on this side of town you have got to swing by and grab yourself some Mucha Lucha."}
{"text":"The burritos are made exactly to your liking (ordering is like Subway type) and the tacos don't disappoint. I especially like the homemade tortillas for the burritos and the fact that they serve black beans as well. Lastly, they also have horchata, mexican soda, tortilla chips & salsa, and churros. I wish I had a taco shop like this in my hometown in California."}
{"text":"Fun, fast, friendly, and tasty taco spot! I tried the 5 street tacos, and loved all of them except the Chiptole style which was a little too sweet and saucy for my taste. My friend ordered the 3 flour tacos with barbacoa, also very delicious. They're fast, all of the ingredients you could tell were freshly chopped and made. Their music is a little loud, but creates a fun atmosphere. I didn't try the guacamole, but from watching other people order after me, I don't think they charge extra for it, because they're quite liberal with all of the ingredients you ask for. Will definitely go back for tacos next time I'm in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Very cool place. Such a variety of meats make it so unique. You're regular taco shop with some extra options. I thought the food was delicious. The staff were so helpful helping me order. Giving me samples of the meats so I can choose exactly what I want. I recommend this place. Definitely coming back. Family friendly environment."}
{"text":"Love this place. Had the carne, chicken and red tacos and they were awesome! Will definitely be a regular."}
{"text":"Salsa FUEGO!!! If you like it spicy, try Mucha Lucha on Thunderbird. It's kinda like Chipotle but better! Much more tasty and authentic. Burrito bowl and street tacos are my fave. Husband likes the burritos.4 year old likes the quesadilla. Friendly staff, good service, great food."}
{"text":"I hadn't been there for a couple of weeks and I noticed they were closed for a couple of days, but they reopened on Saturday 11/19/2017.  I had a carne asada burrito.  It's huge and delicious.  The next day I had five street tacos.  They may look small but five of them are just as filling as the one carne asada burrito.  I love that I can customize the food to my liking. I like it spicy, and boy do they have spicy!  The staff was friendly and patient with me while I decided what I wanted, there is so much to choose from!  From the looks of it, the bar within the restaurant will be opening soon.  I'll definitely come back, especially when the bar opens."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly and patient while I decided what I wanted.  I decided on the rolled tacos.  The rolled tacos didn't disappoint me, they were excellent.  I will definitely be back every time I shop at Paradise Valley Mall."}
{"text":"10/10. Service was great, salsas were spicy, and the meats were flavorful. Best little taco shop."}
{"text":"We took our two daughters (8&5), who love tacos, for dinner. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. We sampled most of the meats before we decided on our order. The food was fresh and delicious: from the meats to the vegetables, the sauces to the churros everything was great. I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"My new favorite Mexican in Gilbert. The wet burrito was fantastic. Chips were fried fresh, guacamole was so good I dropped 2 nickels and picked up a dime. Dilly Dilly ."}
{"text":"Super good tacos not to mention it's in the damn mall! Mmmmm tacos
I had the tinga and the barbacoa they were both very good. The salsa was a little and added a ton of flavor. 
Great work"}
{"text":"Awesome!  Stopped in based on reviews and was not disappointed.
The street tacos were great; my husband had the El Jefe burrito - all freshly prepared and delicious.  The perfect ending was the made to order Churros!"}
{"text":"So I ordered a burrito from there via Postmates and when I got it, it was so spicy that I got sick off two bites and my mouth was a blaze. So I drove to them and had to wait in line forever and when I finally got to the front And explained the situation and the older lady just walked away from me talking Spanish with hella attitude to the other girl (younger) and carried on doing something else.. leaving me standing there. So very politely I asked what was going on and she snapped at me and said \"can you wait a minute please??\" So I closed my eyes trying not to lose my temper and when she finally came back I asked for a refund. She said no, so I asked if I could at least have something else worth the same amount, she said \"no I can't do that, sorry.\" And I flat out said \"so i just wasted my money then right?\" And she said \"the best I can do is two free tacos\" and handed me a coupon for them. So I was like \"okay fine I'll take the tacos\" and they were hella bomb but this old lady was so rude. The younger one was sweet. So if you go here, sample what you're getting before you buy because once your money hits their hands, you're not getting it back and they won't do you any favors by remaking your order."}
{"text":"Sucks. Small portions, overpriced, no taco Tuesday. Salsa is good.better places to choose from"}
{"text":"The best Mexican food around! I've never had a bad experience. Don't forget to get the jalapeño cream cheese!"}
{"text":"All 3 of us ordered wet chimichangas. 2 with carne asada and 1 with carnitas. Everything was delicious. The flavor of the carne asada is the best I have had at any Mexican restaurant. You get to customize your food with various fresh toppings which make this place similar to something like Chipotle, but this place is legit with so many different options and much more authenticity. The service was great and he helped with the meat choices as it was our first time. Will be back many times."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing! Super friendly, good prices and great food. I highly recommend it and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Super delicious authentic mexican food. You can tell its home-made. And the service was awesome. The ladies are so nice, felt like i was in family :)"}
{"text":"I tried to eat here earlier today around 1 PM. While their website says they are opened, their door was clearly locked and someone was walking around inside. I tried to ask if they would be opening later on but the person inside just get shaking her head despite me asking a question. If you're going to close it would be nice to inform your customers or at least open the door for them instead of starring especially when some are driving quite a distance just to try your restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is so yummy.  The burritos are custom order.  They put what you want on your order.  The staff is great and very kind.  We ordered fajitas burrito, open face burrito and chicken burrito.  It was all wonderful.  The salsas ere also very good.  Great place and prices.  Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"We stumbled into this place a few days ago and I can't wait to go back. I ordered a Shrimp Burrito and the shrimp were HUGE and extremely fresh and delicious. The burrito itself was gigantic and full of fresh ingredients. Can't wait to get some more shrimp!"}
{"text":"Ordered taco salad . Shell was cold and stale . Seeing there were only 2 other customers I would think they may put some pride in their food; to possibly get a referral from someone...

Thumbs down! Big disappointment , and if you're looking for so so Mexican food cheap . Keep walking, this nasty piece cost me $14.00 with a corona;("}
{"text":"Best Mexican food place in Scottsdale.  And what I mean by Mexican food is, when you eat here you feel like you are at someone's house who asks you, do you want tacos, or a burrito?  And they make your food fresh, made to order!  I love this place.  It's like if chipotle was 100% Mexican that is what this place is.  Assembly line style which is great.

My faves are: 

Surf and Turf Burrito with beans, rice, cheese, cilantro and habanero salsa!

Shrimp tacos

JJ's Quesadilla"}
{"text":"Pretty good food for the price! The surf and turf burrito is huge and everyone rants and raves about it!"}
{"text":"First time here. Tacos, nachos and the rolled tacos were fantastic. We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Been here twice in the last week. Recommending to everyone I know. Had a burrito bowl with rice and black beans both times with the Carne Asada. Fiancé got street taco's and loves carne Asada but got 2 other meats too and she loved the others more than the carne so that says a lot to me. Also, the churro's are great and come with caramel dipping sauce, so that's always a plus!!"}
{"text":"Amazing tacos, my recommendation are the Baja shrimp tacos. Burritos are huge here and you can get them \"wet\" enchilada style. The theme here is awesome too. Come check it out it won't disappoint I promise."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service with delicious food. The young lady help us decide and pick our lunch. The food is amazing and worth the price."}
{"text":"Every bit of 5 stars; Mexican in meat flavor, but not greasy as most authentic places. Upscale in decor with clean bathrooms and outstanding owner operators."}
{"text":"We were driving by to the grocery store and decided to stop. I love the street tacos. They were spicy and my daughter and I shared them. Horchata was yummy. Everything was fresh and tasty. I will return again."}
{"text":"So tasty!!! Friendly staff too! I wasn't sure what all of the flavors of meat were and the girl behind the counter offered to let me try them all! I got the Super Nachos with Barbacoa beef. So flavorful!"}
{"text":"Oh my!!
This place so close to my house is dangerous!!
Just stopped in for the first time and had the street tacos with spicy beef, chicken and pork. Yes, they were rfg!!
The salsa was great too. 
When they hot, it's hot. When they say super hot, it's super hot!
The roasted chilis on the salsa bar put me over the edge. 
Going back several time this weekend while my wife is gone!
WOO!!"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful!!! The chicken tinga is very spicy (but I love spicy food so I'm more than ok with that)! Every single person in our group was very impressed! 

Come hungry because the portions are very decently-sized."}
{"text":"Great little taco shop. Great selection and price. Had 5 street tacos. 2 with carne asada. 2 with green chili beef and 1 with red carnitas. The red carnitas was amazing. Great flavor. The carne asada was good but had an interesting taste to me. Not sure if i got a different kind of carne or what but it didnt taste the usual to me. Still good though. The green chili beef... Well lets just say its straight fire! It really was hot as hell and this is coming from someone who loves spice. Very tasty but maybe a warning to newbies lol. Fiance ordered rolled tacos and they came filled with some kind of white substance.. Potato maybe? Then topped with chicken and other toppings as per request. They were absouletly delicious. Unlike anything I've ever tried. If you come here get the liter coke in the glass. Nothing like it. Overall, great place. Ill be back. Very affordable and tasty. Jalapeno cream cheese was great!"}
{"text":"Great experience at Mucha Lucha....staff friendly and helpful....owner cooking my food to perfection....my family loved everything we ordered (we each got something different) ....but make sure you order the Macho Fries ( with everything!!!!)"}
{"text":"The rudest employee I have ever met. At 7:49 pm we went to order tacos and was told by this employee that she would not be serving anyone else... when I inquired as to what time they closed, she told me at 8:00 when I showed her that it was still 7:49 pm she said \"it doesn't matter I'm leaving early.\" When I asked for the name of the supervisor she refused. I then asked for her name she also refused. I then call mall security who informed me that the vendor was required to be open till 9:00 and that they were in violation of their lease. Afterwards the whole time the employee kept making faces at us. Extremely unprofessional"}
{"text":"Wanted to give them 5 stars because the food could be spectacular but!!! 

Everything is soooooo spicy that it's hard to tell the difference in flavors.  

They have a huge selection of awesome meats!  Tinga, carne Asana,and more but the heat is overpowering.   

AnD this is from a spicy food lover!!! 

The staff is really nice and the selections are great.  But I was afraid to try some items because my mouth was on fire.  
Also,  we wanted to grab a pint or two of the meats but they don't sell it that way. 

I hope this little joint makes a few tweaks to the spice level and I'll be back to five-star the review!"}
{"text":"Hey Friends Alina here, I came here on Saturday around 1:20 wasn't too busy, but there is not a lot of space to sit. 

I got the red pork carnitas, they were very flavorful a little on the salty side but very good. I would highly recommend for quick tack fix!!"}
{"text":"Great food! Chipotle serving style but much better ingredients! The chips we got were freshly cooked. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"The green chili beef is perfect. The typical person living in this suburban waste land will probably find them too spicy."}
{"text":"Mucha Lucha Taco Shop is a Mexican FAST FOOD casual restaurant. You order at the counter and pick from about 18 flavors of fillings, decide what you want your filling in and move on to decide on toppings and sauces like you do at a Subway or Chipotle kind of restaurant. The difference here is that the food is real like HOME STYLE. The meats are mostly all SLOW BRAISED all very flavorful and spicy. They take the extra time and grill and crisp tortillas.

I went with the Three Taco Platter. There are some rules to picking what you want with the two list of meats (regular meats and signature meats). I wanted to try three different tacos so I had to go with regular meats. I picked three different chicken tacos. I thought it was odd that they offer to fill your taco with rice and beans......

Now to the taste..... (Chicken Tinga, Red Chicken, Vinegar Chicken)


ALL the tacos meat fillings are very flavorful and SPICY! All the chicken is a little dry and stringy....but ok. The tortillas are all nicely grilled. These are very large tacos that are very filled. My really big platter was only $7.25


My LEAST favorite is a redish color thats so smoky I can't eat it...It taste like a Chipotle laced ashtray to me. (my husband didn't mind woofing it down for me...)

I wasn't too found of the other one that was sort of orange.

I liked maybe the one they called Vinegar Chicken (the only one that wasn't orange or red) This one had a nice balance of flavors and a really good heat to it. I would have enjoyed the taco more if I skipped the rice...(I already skipped the beans) On it's own the rice was ok but I didn't enjoy the taste of the rice in the tacos....It just doesn't work for me. 

My husband had the Street Taco Plate. It was 5 small double shelled tacos. He picked all different beef and pork tacos. He enjoyed them all! and he also enjoyed the chipotle super smoky Taco I couldn't eat.

Same as most other restaurants

You are going to like some things more than other things.

Still a good value.

{"text":"This place was honestly the worst taco shop. They don't even deserve a star! They had left over meat on the grill mixed it in my order.. it wasn't clean nor fresh! If your a foodie do not go to this spot..To top it off they were out of ice.. so he went in the back to get us ice and he brought a cup of ice back with dirt all in the ice  not a fan at all"}
{"text":"I am so happy I found this place. The Tacos and burritos are both great. 
I had the Assad tacos, fish burrito, and pollo queso. All were so very tasty. 
I am definitely coming back again."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went here for a quick lunch and we weren't disappointed! I had the surf and turf combo tacos, and they were very good. The carne asada was awesome, and the shrimp was some of the best I've had in a while. She had the super nacos and there was more than enough to share. Everything was very flavorful, and we will be back soon! Overall, a great place for some good mexican food. (I also hear the deliver in a 5 mile radius!!!)"}
{"text":"Our favorite taco shop we have found since moving from California! The staff is SO nice and the tacos are damn delicious. We get the 5 street tacos for $7.49 I think it was and a chicken quesadilla. They have a lot of different meats to choose from and the barbacoa is my favorite, nice and spicy. They also have little taste tester spoons for you to try the meat before you choose. You can also get whatever you want on your taco for no extra charge (including real guacamole) and their salsas are so good! We have been 3 times in 1 week since finding this gem tucked away in the corner of 75th and Thunderbird."}
{"text":"Just do yourself a favor and get the Tacodilla! The carne asade is delicious and the churrod are a great way to finish the meal. Come here- you will be happy you did!"}
{"text":"Maybe I had higher expectations after reading the good reviews or maybe I'm still looking for my \"California\" Mexican food, but I was not impressed.  I'm giving 3 stars (more like 2.75 to be honest) because the service was friendly and the salsa was decent. I ordered a carne asada burrito and the tortilla was really tough and chewy and the carne asada was undercooked and didn't have much flavor.  I'd be willing to give them another chance, but I'd definitely order something else."}
{"text":"The food was great for a cheap price. Had the 5 street tacos and the pork was on point! 
kind of in a hidden location."}
{"text":"The food and service are good and authentic.  Very nice people. It reminds me of a good socal burrito shop. I had the shrimp tacos. They cooked the shrimp and onions right then. They also had horchata so I was like a kid in a candy store. I'll be here again for sure. Strongly recommend if you like Chipotle but you want authentic."}
{"text":"First time here with my family. Very good. Had the 3 sopes with red chili and green chili. Very spicy but full of flavor."}
{"text":"Yummy! Stopped here for a quick bite to eat and was thrilled by their prices and loved their street tacos. I'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food and good portions.Service was quick but it wasn't super clean. We didn't get to try their churros unfortunately, but we might go back and do that."}
{"text":"Wow it was like walking in to one of my Aunts home in Mexico.  The aromatics of the meat cooking just took me back.  So good.  So the size of the tortilla was substantial, not like the tiny size from Tijuana Tacos down the street.  I ordered three Beef Cowboy which is Carne Asada with Serrano Chilies.  Wow was it good n spicy.  I loaded it with cheese, guacamole.  Oh and wgen you go there order the Jalapeno cream cheese fries so good.  My spouse ordered four Tacos.  The Salsa bar was the real deal, real spicy authentic salsa.  Overall we paid 22.00.  Far cry from the other Taco place with over priced mico tacos n nasty salsa."}
{"text":"I've waited to post a review of Mucha Lucha until visiting for a third time in two weeks and after sending 5 different friends and family members to try it out. (Each of them have visited multiple times as well and are thrilled to have it in Gilbert).

The food is very delicious, made very well and the restaurant is always clean. If you enjoy spicy food, this is the place for you. The green chile beef as well as the barbacoa are packed with flavor. Try the 5 rolled tacos topped with your choice of meat, can't go wrong with the carne asada on any dish, some of the best I've had. Others in our party really enjoyed the three different types of chicken.

Really pleased with this place, staff is very kind and want to help you have a great experience. 

Only downside, I will note, is they do not have a soda fountain, which isn't too big of a deal, hence the 5 star review!"}
{"text":"Eat here.  Skip all the hipster taco joints and come here for great tasting tacos.  The food is great, the atmosphere is great, and everyone is extremely friendly.  Besides the great atmosphere it's great to find a place that's just as good or better than those taco joints on Roosevelt Row or Central & Camelback, that charges reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"This place is great.  My wife and I both had the street tacos, and they didn't disappoint.  Ordering was easy, and they prepared it quickly, let me customize the toppings, and we were off to our table.  I tried the Tinga Chipotle Chicken and Red Carnitas, and they were both fantastic.  Looking forward to trying something else next time I'm in.

The decor is fun, and I enjoyed the whole Luchadores theme.  Staff seemed friendly and efficient, and the place was clean.  Overall, I'd definitely recommend people give this place a shot!"}
{"text":"In a land swarming with tacos you need to be especially vigilant in discerning between the real players and the 'also rans'.  For me solid indicators include-  high quality home-made tortillas, high percentage of Hispanic patronage, and a simple and well executed menu.  The Mucha Lucha excels on all accounts.

The place is efficiently run and contains all of the standards you'd expect.  Highlights include their taco Tuesday special and the surf -n- turf burrito.  Only complaints would be some of the portions are too large.  I needed two days to work through the burrito, maybe offer smaller portions."}
{"text":"This place is SOOOOOO GOOD. The staff was nice and super helpful in their recommendations of the menu."}
{"text":"This good is AMAZING!!! If you want real legit Mexican food come here!!! I will be back ever time I want Mexican food!!!"}
{"text":"Chipotle style joint, very unimpressed with the quality and portion. I do not recommend coming here, just hit up chipotle instead."}
{"text":"Normally I'm okay with spicy - but the items we were told were mild were still too spicy to finish my meal.

That's fine, but the place was too warm as to be uncomfortable and the service wasn't good (the person taking my order literally walked away fo before I was even thru ordering, it was really odd).  

It also was really pricey, not horrible, but just to much for the lackluster experience.  I won't go back."}
{"text":"Delish!

Today my co-workers and I dined at Mucha Lucha Taco Shop after reading all the positive reviews online.  The  restaurant  was a little challenging  to locate; it is in a strip mall and there is not large sign.  

I decided to get a Carne Asada burrito and my co-workers went with the tacos, since Mucha Lucha is  a taco shop.  After please select your meat, it is warmed up on the grill then you get to choose whatever you would like in your burrito or on your taco. There is a large variety of topics to choose from,   Rice, sour cream or a chipotle sour cream.  All our entrees were absolutely delicious.  The meat was flavorful and tender as was the rest of the toppings.

The service is great, the prices are reasonable, and the food is delicious. Would return in the future."}
{"text":"All I can start with is AMAZING. I got the 5 street tacos and was able to choose 3 different meats (I ordered Tinga Chicken, Carne Asada, and Plain Carnitas). The woman in the front was very friendly and helpful as this was my first time here. Since I have moved here (a year ago) I have not been able to find an authentic Mexican taco place nearby (excluding the taco truck that sits in a parking lot near 83rd) and was not willing to drive to Phoenix. This place is exactly what I was used to in California so I was thrilled when I tried it because I crave street tacos at least weekly. The meat is heated up right in front of you on the grill so your food is VERY hot when you get it. You are able to pick and choose what you would like on your tacos so it makes it much more custom (much like a Chipotle). A good small selection of salsas is available as well at the salsa bar. I will admit that their Pepsi had a bit of a funky taste to it (I think the ice) but it kind of made it just that much more authentic. Very well priced. I WILL DEFINITELY BE COMING BACK!"}
{"text":"Delish!

Today my co-workers and I dined at Mucha Lucha Tacos.  I decided to get a Carne Asada burrito and my co-workers went with the burritoin a bowl.  After please select your meat, it is warmed up on the grill then you get to choose whatever you would like in your burrito. There is a large variety of topics to choose from,   Rice, sour cream or a chipotle sour cream.  All our entrees were absolutely delicious.  The meat was flavorful and tender as was the rest of the toppings.

The service is great, the prices are reasonable, and the food is delicious. Would return in the future."}
{"text":"I was very sceptical. Good tacos in a mall? No way. My husband convinced me to give this place a try and I'm very glad he did. Legit tacos. Tasty Asada. Can't wait to try the other items on the menu. The owner is always cheery and you can tell she cares about what she does. Thanks Mucha Lucha! We will definitely be regulars."}

{"text":"Holy Jarritos... this place is killer!

My boy Evan and I stopped in Mucha Lucha for a fast Tuesday lunch (we actually found it on Yelp!) 

Plain and simple: this place is great! The seating is limited but there is a good variety on the menu. They offer over fifteen options for meats. 

I got the carne asada street tacos and my dear friend ordered the wet burrito with shrimp. The tacos get a five out of five from me, Evan gave the burrito a four out of five because there were a lot of onions.

I'm coming back here before I return to Tennessee!"}
{"text":"Wanted to come to this place for over the past month. I get here at 6:40 and they're CLOSED! Sign says open 10am-8pm.."}
{"text":"Went after work, we ordered some variety, the chicken street tacos, green chicken burrito, tacoqueso.  The meat is way too SALTY!! I couldn't even finish my food!  Only thing that was good was the churro.  Over priced and over salty!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in town! My family and I travel to Arizona from Cali once a month and we never leave without stopping here at much lucha taco shop. The street tacos, shrimp tacos and mucha lucha fries are to die for! We've never had a bad experience here. Staff is super friendly and the portions of food never disappoint. Would recommend to anyone wanting Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Amazing shrimp and fish tacos! This is my new go-to place. It's around $8 for 3 tacos and the pieces of fish on them are giant. I'm always stuffed after I eat all three. 
They also have lots of other meats and toppings to choose from."}
{"text":"By far the best Fast food taco shop in town, especially as a vegetarian. So addicting, we've make it a tradition to come here. The staff knows us and greets us every time! There are plenty of options from tacos to burritos to wet burritos and plenty of meats, fillings, and some good dressings. Just note that sometimes the salsa can be on the spicy side (even the mild) for those who don't like really spicy foods, but definitely very good salsas, 4+ choices of salsas."}
{"text":"It is nice they are in middle of remodel you go up to order they do have beer seems nice food was great my wife and coworkers made me go back the next weekend and order more food."}
{"text":"My wife and I both had our order screwed up tonight they don't seem to understand. I tried to correct them to no avail. The food we got was good but doubtful that we will be back. 

Looks like they didn't make it."}
{"text":"Love the tostadas with barbacoa! I get them every time I come here.  Just enough of spicy!"}
{"text":"Wow, this was great. Had the rolled tacos with green chile beef. Spicy, fresh, tons of flavor. Everything cooked there as you ask for it. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I haven't had street tacos this incredible since I was actually in Mexico. Im upset I've been living here for years without knowing about it! A great place to take out of towners looking for an authentic Mexican food experience. Pork mole was out of this world. I recommend getting the 5 street tacos so you can choose 5 different meats. So, so, so delicious!"}
{"text":"I take all my new staff here! I love this place my husband and I come all the time we work down the street. It is like pick your own kind of like Chipotle but so much better and authentic. I will continue going here almost once a week. You should try it!!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite place to eat Mexican food! Authentic, fresh, lots of variety, quick and excellent service!"}
{"text":"If I had to say something negative about this place it would have to be the stinginess of the chip.. Not that bad for being the worst about this place.
Positives about the place, it is a very clean place with very kind and seem to be hard working people, on top of that my breakfast burrito the \"El jefe burrito\" was massive and very flavorful I could hardly finish it.. In a good way, very fulfilling and cost effective! I would recommend this to anyone who like a good Mexican burrito!"}
{"text":"Best taco shop in Arizona!!! Food is authentic and delicious. I recommend the surf and turf tacos. Their jalapeño cream cheese and chipotle sauce is to die for. Fresh food, and clean environment. The owners are very kind and friendly."}
{"text":"Why?! Why??? Why is this place hidden?! Why it didn't take me long to find this place but it deserves a spot next to the street! This place is amazing! Delicious street style tacos  I would definitely recommend to all my friends and taco lovers! Too bad I don't live in this area but I'm very lucky to have tried this place."}
{"text":"My husband and I just tried this place last week and have already eaten there 3 times! They have awesome food and great customer service. I tried the tinga chicken tacodillas and my husband got a carne asada burrito and they were both great! The last two times I've had the rolled tacos topped with tinga chicken and I have never had rolled tacos as good as these. They roll them and fry them as soon you order them! Amazing. My husband got the wet burrito with red carnitas and red sauce. He loved it! We definitely found our new favorite spot! I highly recommend trying this place!!"}
{"text":"This place has very good tacos, I got the five taco plate and it was good trying all the different kinds of meat my favorite was the barbecue and pork. The vegetables are especially fresh. The pico de gallo was yummy. Very local feeling to the restaurant. Lots of different stuff to try I will come back."}
{"text":"The best part about this place is that there are so many topping options with great flavors that you can make the style of Mexican food that you want. You want street style, they have the Cilantro, Onion, cucumber and roasted salsa for that. You want creamy Cilantro dressing for a fresh Mex flare, they have that too (similar to cafe Rio flavors.) You want bowls loaded with corn and rice and meat and beans... They got that. Every thing we tried was delicious!  My only complaint is that a la cart was high in price, you have to get a plate to get a deal."}
{"text":"Most wanted taco shop was the bomb diggity. It has changed and tastes horrible. Different menu, different people, different all around. Never again."}
{"text":"It looks like a classic Mexican food court restaurant but it's much better! The street tacos are the best I've ever had! You have to check this place out!"}
{"text":"A must try! Great food. Live bands on Thrusday and friday nights. Very laid back environment."}
{"text":"Excellent food. First time being here and the staff was friendly and offered tastes of the meats and suggestions. 
Food is fresh and flavor able. 
I'm glad we found this taco shop and will be going back!"}
{"text":"My brother and I returned again.  We both had the 5 street tacos.  I tried the 3 different types of beef and non-spicy pork.  We agreed most of it sucked.  There was one beef taco that was good.  Wasn't sure which beef it was but it was really tasty.  Unfortunately the others were barely edible.

My brother said it wasn't as good as he remembered it and doesn't care to return anymore."}
{"text":"WOW was my reaction to the incredible street tacos I experienced at Mucha Lucha. So flavorful and fulfilling this restaurant is now my go to when I'm in Phoenix and in need of some some amazing food. I'll never look at Chipotle the same again."}
{"text":"I drive past this place all the time and finally decided to try it today.  Boy have I been missing out, I got a burrito bowl and it is by far the tastiest bowl I've ever had.  The salsa was amazing too, especially if you like them spicy.  This place puts Chipotle to shame, I can't wait to try Mucha Lucha again."}
{"text":"This shop has the absolute best tacos. Exceptional service and great prices. 
Couldn't ask for better when in the mood for some good tacos"}
{"text":"Probably one of the nicest owners/workers I've ever met. They chatted with me while making my food and gave me some free chips too. I had their chicken taco salad which was really good. I love Mexican food so I can't wait to go back for tacos."}
{"text":"One of the best little mexican joints that I have been to in Phoenix. I got the surf and turf burrito, which was even bigger than one from chipotle. On top of that it also tasted better than a chipotle burrito and didn't give me norovirus either (too soon?) In all seriousness the burrito was great and the atmosphere is nice too. The drawings on the walls gives the place a unique character."}
{"text":"Hands down favorite.

Hubby took our order to the table while I paid for the food. Before I could hand over the $22 dollars he reported to me \"this is really good.\"

He throughly enjoyed three soft tacos with a side order of chips and salsa. I ordered and love the rolled tacos. Unlike other restaurants, not only did the tacos include red chicken (because they are made to order you choose your protein), but additional chicken was piled on top.

If you like Mexican food, this is a must.

Our tab with drinks was $21.93 plus tip."}
{"text":"Tasty! A bit expensive depending on the item you choose. Street tacos were extremely reasonable though! I had the kids split the nachos and they were easily polished off!"}
{"text":"Great food. Large portions. Very affordable. Great Mexican food for my first time visit out to Scottsdale. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The reviews for this place were not wrong. The food was great and the staff was very accommodating with a few special orders we had. I had the barbacoa wet burrito with habanero salsa and it was darn tasty. My wife got an order of nachos with the green chili pork which wad also great. I would like to say that they made my wife nachos even though it wasn't listed on the menu. I will be back."}
{"text":"Some of the best tacos in the Phoenix area. The tortillas are warmed on their grill before adding their delicious meat choices. They pile on the extras (lettuce, onions, etc.) and their salsa has a good kick to it.

I recommend their street tacos."}
{"text":"I looooove this place! Huge portions, great price!
Chipotle style assembly of custom burritos, tacos and something chipotle doesn't have, chimichangas!!! So awesome I live close by."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic lunch here 

I got a bowl with the green chile beef- it had just the right amount of spice.

The chips and guac were fantastic! Everything was very fresh and flavorful."}
{"text":"ommgggggggggg these tacos are fireeeeeeeeeeee this has got to be the best taco and burrito spot in arizona. the customer service is awesome there food is always fresh and drinks are stocked. the music along with the mexican art on the walls really set the mood. i got the fish and shrimp tacos and they were to die for. i could literally come here three times a day. my wife got the street taco plate and tried about every meat they had and she loved them as well. we will definitely be back more then likely tomorrow lol. we got a churro to go with caramel sauce it was amazing it has some type of custard filling. cant wait to bring my mom when her flight lands."}
{"text":"Best mexican food in Arizona. Hands down! This place makes chipotle food feel like you're chewing cardboard. The artwork is awesome, they have a mexican luchador theme, reminds me of my childhood! Im not exaggerating people. Im from So Cal so im picky when it comes to mexican food. It starts with the meat. The selection is fantastic and they even serve burrito and taco bowls. Definitely a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite street tacos in the East Valley...period! Great family run business and five street tacos for under $10 is a fair price. Corn tortillas were flavorful and all the meats I've had were excellent....you pick out your extras after the tacos are ready and they add them for you...and unlike many places you get real guacamole if you want it.

Excellent value, great taste and I've been back many times...."}
{"text":"This place is amazing everything is delicious and the people are so nice !!!! Try it you won't be sorry !"}
{"text":"The street tacos were so tasty! If I'm ever back in Gilbert, I'll be swinging by again for sure."}
{"text":"Came here to try this place out with a friend. Decent but reasonable distance to drive. 
Small parking lot outside.
Came around 2pm on Saturday. Was not busy. No waiting. 
Inside is very simple.
Ordering station is like Chiptole. You can see what you can get and they will add it into your order.
Menu is pretty simple, but you have no idea the type of meat that they have unless you ask. 

Food:
I got the Meat burrito this time. 
For the meat, I got the green chile pork roast. As this was too have some spice to it *not that spicy after tasting it). 
The green chile pork does have good flavor and the meat is very moist and breaks downs easily when you bite into it. Pretty good. 
They will heat up a big tortilla before letting you make your burrito
I got pretty much everything on display, Including the Jalapeno cream cheese, but that cost around $1.48 extra, little bit expensive just for that. However, it did make the burrito taste different and it was good. 
Guac sauce is also extra around that same price, but I did not get that. 

I got 3 of their sauce in the burrito, which tasted good to me when it's mixed and you bite into the burrito. 

Price:
I think the burrito costed around $8.50 + tax, my total was around $9.60 or something because of additional charge of cream cheese. 

Would recommend trying this place. They do have seafood taco and street tacos style. Will need to come back and try them as well."}
{"text":"I've lived in Phoenix all my life, and I've been to many Mexican restaurants, but never had such delicious Mexican food as I had at Mucha Lucha!  Its a little dive restaurant, but if you can over look the decor your taste buds will love you!  The food is so fresh, authentic, and the service is great, and you get a lot of food for the money.  My husband said that the Bandera Wet Burrito with shrimp is one of the best dishes he's ever had."}
{"text":"The street tacos were awesome. Here is the best part...Our also ordered the Bandera Wet Burrito. It was awesome. So much flavor. I'll be back for sure...."}
{"text":"My work friends and I have been coming here for the past couple of months for lunch. In the beginning the food was excellent and it was good quality at a fair price. Recently they have started to charge for items that you would normally get for free at other restaurants. We normally get the burritos and it is an extra $1.25 for jalapeno cream cheese. Since the burritos are served with chips we get a side of salsa with it, they now charge $1.00 for a 1oz portion of salsa. So now the cost of the burrito is $2.25 over what they have listed.  $1.00 for 1oz is just crazy!"}
{"text":"Very friendly service and good options. Would be even better if they had a non shredded meat option, like chicken, since the meat all comes with a lot of \"juice\". I like shredded meat, but it leaves your plate with a lot of greasy puddles. Very spicy but the sauces are flavorful and the cabbage helps tone it down a little."}
{"text":"We decided to try something new since we were craving Mexican.  I wanted shrimp, so I found Mucha Lucha on Yelp.  Hubby got the carne asada nachos & I had the Baja shrimp tostadas.  Both items were delicious & fresh tasting.  The carne asada was so tender.  The baja shrimp was deliciously grilled with peppers and onions.  The extra hot green salsa and chipotle sauce were so good.  We will be back to try more menu items for sure."}
{"text":"Love this place! I showed up for breakfast and asked for something off the menu and one of the owners, Fernando, didn't flinch. He whipped me up huevos ranchers in a few minutes and they were FANTASTIC!

What a nice guy as well. He loves what he does and shows by the smile on his face and also the taste of the food. 

TRY THIS PLACE!!

Thank you Much Lucha, for the phenomenal breakfast.

Un fan fiel!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb! Can't say enough about good the food and people are here. The portions are insane and everything I've had so far tastes authentic and amazing. Do yourself a favor and check this place out."}
{"text":"This is a pretty sweet place. Been looking for a new authentico taco joint since I moved to Scottsdale. Looks like I found it."}
{"text":"Ended up here by accident and went back two more times in a week.  Sampled a bunch of meats and all were great.  Settled on surf and turf burro and was sold.  Had the carne asada burro to follow up then surf and turf again.  Can't wait to get back. If I worked closer this would be my go too spot."}
{"text":"Arizona is filled with tons of Mexican restaurants, but this one stands above the rest. They have amazing food, service, and prices. I split an order of rolled tacos and street tacos and they were both great. Fresh ingredients are piled high and paired with your choice of delicious sauces. The staff was very friendly and treated us as friends while discussing the menu options. 
If you want a quick meal of great tacos, look no further: This is the best place around!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today because me and my husband have been looking for some good street tacos. We're from California where there is so many places to enjoy great street tacos and have had a hard time find some here in Arizona. These are by far the best tacos I've had thus far and for a reasonable price. I will definitely be coming back soon :) I"}
{"text":"Hidden treasure that will make you come back for more! They decorate your burrito the way you want and the tacos are to die for!!!!"}
{"text":"I came here based on their reviews and while their prices and customer service are great, their vegetarian options are few and bland. I got the 5 tacos with rice, beans and fajita added and I struggled to find the right combo of sauces to add flavor. Also, the cooked the fajitas (bell peppers and onions) on the grill they had just cooked meat on with no cleaning or even a switch of the utensils which grossed me out as I could taste the meat guts. I will not be back for these reasons."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a great authentic Mexican cuisine you found it. I love this place from the amazing food to the Mexican wrestling theme. Great spot can't go wrong with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. I've had the nachos, wet burrito, and burrito bowl and loved each and every one! If you're a spice lover, this place is especially great. Their shrimp is one of my favorite proteins to get in my meals."}
{"text":"Have driven past this place several times and finally stopped!! So glad we did! Food was excellent service was great! Price for the quantity of food is perfect. Only suggestion would be to turn down the AC! Made it an uncomfortable environment."}
{"text":"Very good Authentic style Menu. I have eaten here several times and have been pleased. Place is small with not a lot of seating so might need to take it to go though if busy. Staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"SO GOOD! Just went here for the first time ever (we just moved here) and I had no idea what to order. They kindly let me taste some of the meats so I could make my decision! I had the street tacos with the two mild spice pork and it was BOMB DOT COM. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for quick Mexican food and always go out of my way to come here. I have been coming here since they first opened and have been a regular since. There food is literally so amazing, I have cravings for it all the time. I get there Spicy Chicken Nachos and my boyfriend gets a Carne Asade Burrito and we are more content then ever after eating. 

I definitely miss the family that use to work here when this location originally opened cause they always went out of their way to talk to us. But even now with the new staff, I still love the food the same."}
{"text":"Very good food. My favorite is the veggie tostada. I love the variety/options of toppings. Prices are slightly high for what you get but yummy and fresh. Also, a meatless item should include guacamole at no extra charge since I'm not getting meat. Clean. Friendly service."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised to find this place so close to me in Gilbert. Real Tacos and spicy salsa that actually made me sweat! I typically have to go into Phoenix for the real deal. Not anymore, I'm hooked!! Food is excellent, casual environment. What more could you want?!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic Chipotle that doesn't skimp on the guacamole. This is the place! The meat was delicious, the vegetables were fresh and the taco salad shell was homemade. Not to mention the customer service was A+. Don't miss out on a gem."}
{"text":"The murals on the wall are cool. I like the corrugated steel around the counter.... however... the food was just ok. Not cooked to order, just heated up to order. The tortillas on the tacos were to big for the filling inside. The salsas at the salsa bar we're not salsas they were hot sauces. I saw they had a ice tea brewing machine... I ordered a ice tea and they gave me raspberry syrup tea from the coke machine cause they hadn't brewed the real tea. Not authentic Mexican food by any means.  Taco fail Saturday"}
{"text":"Went in today to get some food, heard a lot about the place. Guy was on his phone trying to take my order. Lol alright no issue, asked for rice in the bowl asked for a little extra rice, he said 1.99 more while trying to talk to the person on the other end of the phone. Hard to understand what was going on and why I have to try and communicate with a guy when they are taking my money for an order. I don't care how good a place is, learn customer service! That is the key."}
{"text":"Best tacos ever!!  5 street tacos combo was the best!  You get to try a little bit of everything.  Multiple toppings!  Clean, friendly, and quick service!  I'll be back again!  I'm never disappointed!"}
{"text":"I googled \"best tacos near me\" and saw how close I was to Mucha Lucha so I thought, let me check them out! Best decision I've made in 2017 LOL! I will be here at least once a week the food is that good! BEST, REAL tacos in AZ!!!"}
{"text":"Hate to write this but wow! I ordered a taco salad ($9) and the girl put the smallest amount of carnitas on it and even took some off. Ridiculous. So I asked for \"a little more carnitas\" and she takes the small amount she took off and then puts it back on. When I go to pay I'm charged +$3 for the portion she took off and put back on.. it was nothing.. I love the food and I've come here enough times to know what to expect when I order but I'm done coming here when there's so many other great options closeby. Their profit margins are high enough they don't have to do this to people. They treat the business like its in a tourist city in MX."}
{"text":"This is an awesome little place I can't believe I've just recently found out about ! It is tucked in the plaza by bashas on 75th and thunderbird the food will not disappoint, it was truly great ! I am very picky when I eat Mexican food, I got the 3 tacodillas basically a quesadilla and then you get to load it up with whatever you want, onions, peppers, guac, pico, cilantro, corn, they have a lot to choose from and a little salsa bar - all salsas were great 
I am looking forward to returning and trying other things! I wish I grabbed a picture before I ate all my food but it was too good to wait !"}
{"text":"First off, the employees are so nice!  They were so happy to answer any questions and make suggestions. Everything was delicious, especially the chipotle cream they put on the tacos!  The kids had quesadillas and rice and cleaned their plates. We tried the tacos and a carne asada quesadilla, both were good.  They have a salsa bar, my favorites were the mildest salsa and the chopped up roasted peppers!  We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"If you want some really good burritos or tacos this is the place! I had a chicken burrito smothered(wet) with red and green chile sauce! I really enjoyed the red sauce. I'll be back to try the rest of their menu for sure."}
{"text":"The food is so fresh and flavorful, and great portions for the price. The carne asada is amazing!! Family owned and operated. Support this wonderful little local business, we want to keep it in our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Best Tacos in the world homemade authentic delicious. Definitely recommend trying this place if your in the area... Service is fresh ...."}
{"text":"Our first time here. We weren't sure what to order. The woman working offered to let us try a few of the meats before ordering. The meats were super tender and flavorful. Great meal for a great price!"}
{"text":"Holy Mole man! Oh my goodness, perfect! This is likely going to become a favorite taco spot for us. I went in hungry and thought I would be able to down 5 rolled tacos and 5 street tacos. I must say, I am glad I held back and went with the street tacos only on this trip because 5 street tacos was more than plenty. 

I went with the grilled fish, the gentleman asked if I would like them fajita style. Of course, if you're offering, you know what's best. I topped it just as I wanted and they were delicious! The tortillas were incredible! They have a selection of sauce/salsa, believe them when they tell you which ones are hot because some of them do have mucho spice!

The place is small, it's clean and I like etching/branding on the tables. So glad tacos made the menu for me today and I cannot wait to try more soon!"}
{"text":"Best spot for authentic Mexican food. Burrito is huge and shrimp tacos are amazing! Def going back."}
{"text":"The size of chipotle but taste much more authentic.  I thought it was going to be blan since it's in the mall but quite the opposite.  Have the entire office frequenting there now"}
{"text":"Everything her is amazing and it's so damn clean!! Even the bathrooms!!! Real authentic Mexican food and fast!!!"}
{"text":"There is a Mucha Lucha on Broadway in Tempe that I eat lunch at regularly. Best carne asada burrito in town. Street tacos to die for. I suggested they open one near my home in Gilbert, and they did!  Now we can get top notch authentic Mexican food in our own neighborhood. I highly recommend the carne asada burrito ranchero style. Food for two meals and fresh ingredients. Not greasy like a lot of places.  I love this place!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome ! The street taco menu is simple and must try the five street taco meal! The carne asada and the carnitas are the bomb!"}
{"text":"The fish tacos I've been searching for!!! It's so hard to find good fish tacos, and especially ones that aren't fried or breaded. I cannot wait to come back."}
{"text":"I had the carne asada street tacos & ended up with a self tapping sheet metal screw in my mouth. If they can't keep screws out of their food, I can't help but wondering what else was in there.  I will be contacting the proper Maricopa County office.  This place needs to CLOSE!"}

{"text":"Last minute decision to try a new taco shop on a beautiful Tuesday night. Liked that I could order and pay ahead on Yelp. I ordered the burrito bowl with shrimp and lots of trimmings for $10.50, it came in a 7\" tin to go and was packed with food, tasty although some of the shrimp were a tad dry. I could not finish it in one sitting. My son had the beef barbacoa burrito with lots of trimmings, that puppy was heavy and good according to the teenage human vacuum, $8.
My husband also had the burrito bowl, red chicken with cilantro lime rice, tasty but that same 7\" container was only half full, $8.50, for a big man very disappointing. They put in 2 1/2 small bags of chip we were not expecting, but no salsa?? I like that they offer fish and grilled at that, worth the extra $2 for not the same old, same old. The taco shop is new and tucked away in the Bashas shopping center, it would be useful to let folks know that on Yelp so they can find it.
Will we try it again, not sure, they have tons of competition and our first experience was with mixed reviews, looks like a family operation, hopefully they read their reviews."}
{"text":"What a great place to grab some Mexican fare. While the building itself just has a strip mall feel...what's inside is worth the stop.

Think of this as a more authentic Chipotle kind of restaurant. You order the dish you want and then build it from the available ingredients. The tastes really stand out.

The vibe is pretty funky with a Mexican wrestling flair. 

Very cool place...check it out."}
{"text":"You will not be let down by their tacos! Topping galore and the salsa truly taste home made. Will definitely be coming here a lot"}
{"text":"Great food at a good price. We had a great tasting wet burrito and recommend the 5 tacos. Check them out."}
{"text":"Still loving Mucha Lucha! Just tried the burrito bowl and it is my new favorite. Even tastier than tacos and easy to take to-go. Yum!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I usually get my food to go because it's not really a sit down restaurant. The staff is friendly and the food is excellent. One of the best taco places in the South Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"I will start by saying that the food tasted good but the portion size of ingredients was extremely small. When I requested a little more cheese they literally put like 3 additional pieces of the shredded cheese on my street tacos. I noticed other people having the same order as me but their street tacos were so full it was hard for them to fold.  After seeing this several times it hit me that the difference between me and the other customers was that I am white and the others Hispanic.  I do not recommend this place to anyone who is NOT Hispanic."}
{"text":"Now this is Mexican Food!
I got the 5 street taco's and they were awesome!
Everything is made fresh & U custom order!
Yummy!!"}
{"text":"The food was fantastic. We wanted Mexican food and the YELP review had great reviews.  The taco shop is located in a tiny strip mall.  The food was so fresh and cooked on the grill and you can watch them prepare it. You can also sample the meat to decide how spicy hot you want."}
{"text":"This is our new favorite mexican place!  The food is so good, we have had tacos, burritos, and fries.  The staff is super friendly and will sample the meats if you can't decide what to get."}
{"text":"I'm glad I took a chance on something new! This place is fresh, flavorful, and friendly! I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Great place for burritos. They took the concept of chipotle but it is actually good tasting and not just generic tasting ingredients in a bowl."}
{"text":"Favorite spot from my days in Phoenix. Would highly recommend to anyone in the area. Used to take all my friends and they fell in love too!"}
{"text":"We hoped to like this place with all the good reviews. Unfortunately Taco Bell is better.  They hardly give you any meat.  The burrito we ordered was mostly rice and lettuce.  And the rolled tacos had NO meat inside, just a little meat on top."}
{"text":"I've lived near here for two years and am so disappointed with myself for just now finally going. 
Had the Macho fries with green Chile beef. *warning the green Chile beef is spicy AF*
The guy warned us but said it was his fave, and traditonally thats my fave and it was so good. Like the green Chile back in Albuquerque. It was so hot though haha!
My friend got the burro with the three sauces on top and she really liked it as well. She has a little lower tolerance for spicy than me so she needed a lot of sour cream. If you don't like extremly spicy food I recommend not getting the green Chile beef.
Bottom line, we both enjoyed our extremely spicy food and I will be going back."}
{"text":"Family run shop. Great people & food. Agree the Bandera Wet Burrito stellar and enough for 2-3 meals!  Spicy beef in red sauce!! Yowza!"}
{"text":"The staff was  very helpful in my selection of what I should order. They provided personal opinions as well as asking me what I like. I went with chicken tinga and Barbacoa tacos.. amazing!! I also splurged and got a carne quesadilla. All of the food was amazing! Oh and homemade Salsas selection is impressive and carries heat and taste. I highly recommend it for any level of Mexican food enthusiast."}
{"text":"I have to admit I was a tad nervous trying this place but my fears were completely out to rest. The breakfast burrito, tacos, and beef burrito we all got here were amazing. My breakfast burrito put all others to shame... it was very good, great portion sizes, good prices and everyone was very friendly.
This definitely had that authentic taqueria feel and flavor... and I should stress that this is NOT a Mexican restaurant, it's a TAQUERIA. It's well worth checking out... the El Jefe is fantastic and when my folks come to town I will be taking them here!"}
{"text":"It's very authentic, and very clean it's good restaurant. But I did not like the food at all! This was my first time coming, and the food wasn't even as good as filibertos. Better off going to Taco Bell. Try for yourself hopefully the food will be better for you."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best burrito place ever! They have many variants of tortilla and there chicken burrito is to die for! Reasonably priced and so tasty this place deserves a visit for every Mexican food lover!"}
{"text":"This is not fancy food, it's homestyle. Three people working behind the counter produce made to order Mexican food fairly quickly which tastes as good as it looks. I ordered a carne asada burrito and my wife had surf and turf (she's not a burrito fan so she got hers on a plate). I tasted her decent sized shrimp, it was butterflied and grilled to perfection. Next time I will have that in my burrito. This is another one of those places that you go to for the food and not the atmosphere. I don't like to give 5 stars for a review but Yelp doesn't allow 4.5. Not that there was anything that I felt needed improvement. This place will replace our usual neighborhood place."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today.   It is not a fast food place - it is a quality food place.   The lady helping up let us try the meet prior to choosing which was awesome.   They have LOTS of meat to choose to get in your tacos.  The food  was soooo yummy.   My other half is a picky food eater so being able to pick toppings as you went was great for her.   We both got five street tacos.   I tried horchata for the first time and liked it.   The service was warm and friendly."}
{"text":"Go ahead...get in line....and go to TACO HEAVEN!  A taco is certainly not a taco at Mucha Lucha. This place left me amazed at the tacos that may also be found in heaven The choices and options made the combinations staggering. As you stand in line salivating...you think you have it all figured out till it's your turn and you want e everything on the menu. The three taco deal and 5 taco deals are what I went for. Left with my tastebuds singing in Spanish!!! THREE words: jalapeno cream cheese. *Mike drop*"}
{"text":"One of the best tacos places I've been to in a long time. I  got the 5 street tacos deal. I tried it with the 5 different meats. It was so yummy and I could really taste the flavor in all the ingredients. I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service ! Ordered some chicken tacos. The server let me sample the different kinds of chicken they had, and you can customize for each one! Lots of toppings to choose from and great prices too. Would definitely come back"}
{"text":"Finally had the chance to pop in. Grabbed the street tacos so I could sample all of the meats. Green Chile pork has a serious kick. The regular chicken was delicious as was the red. Decor is cool, music a bit loud it was hard to hear the staff when I was ordering (thus why I am not sure of the official names of meats) for a plate of 5 street tacos the price was great for our area, the rest of the menu seemed a bit high priced IMO when compared to other Mexican joints around here for similar items."}
{"text":"I am always down to support a small family owned business in my area, especially when they are quality shops.  My husband and I LOVE street tacos and Mexican food in general, so we try any new places in the area and have been to pretty much all the local spots including food trucks.

We like to try a place a few times before really deciding on how good it is.  Our first visit was on a weeknight, and there was only one family ahead of us (who seemed to be return customers).  We didn't really know how the whole process worked, but we figured it out.  The couple that was working behind the counter was very friendly and took our orders.  

The service is setup kinda like a Chipotle, you walk by the ingredients and tell them what to include in your food.  The menu is legible and they have delicious additions for each meal.  First time (and every time since) I ordered the carne asada street tacos (w/cheese, onion, and cilantro).  The meat is seriously tender and delicious.  My husband usually orders the carne asada burrito and gets extra meat and spicy.  He loves this burrito...not sure what else he gets in it, but it really depends on what you like.

The place looks like a little 'hole-in-the-wall' joint and is kinda hidden in a complex that probably doesn't get much business...but they bring in the business.  The 4 times we have been in the past month, we are never the only people in there.  Sometimes they get a little slow with the ordering process, but they have to grill everything up fresh and put it together.  It is worth the wait if there ever is one.  We have never had to wait more than 15 minutes to get our order.

Oh, last thing..the horchata...oh man...it is the best!  They actually make it per the 'original' recipe and you can tell it isn't just a powder mix."}
{"text":"I'm always skeptical on Mexican food restaurants but we were blown away here! All my kids kept saying \"This is the best!\" Flipping amazing! Wow! My favorite Mexican food HANDS DOWN!!"}
{"text":"Well. To start, we were the only people in the joint and the only car in the parking lot so I knew right away his could go one of two ways. 

The ordering process is hectic and they start cooking your food right away without the other people on your party ordering. So it's kinda a chipotle wanna be. But with a group of 7 my food was done first and waited 10 minutes cooking before I could eat it. 

The carne asada was really good on the macho fries but the picture doesn't tell the full story. It shows guacamole on the fries on a few different items but at the register they charge you for extra everything. They charged my grandmother 75 cents for extra cheese and I kid you not it was maybe 10 crumbles of cheese. 

Also they only have bottle drinks. Not even water cups. So go next store to circle K to get a soda or water before. 

When I brought up the fact that the picture doesn't match the food they said I don't know it's just extra for guac. Change your advertising then. 

I'll give it a 3 because the food was decent but not for the price or convenience and experience. 

I hate to give bad reviews but they need to work on some stuff for sure as a new restaurant. I wish them the best in the coming months."}
{"text":"A true gem in the desert.  Do not judge this book by its cover.  Located in a older strip mall and sparsely decorated inside, Mucha Lucha is cranking out deeply flavorful delights.  Start with an order of 5 street tacos and mix 'em up to get a great sampling of the offerings.  My personal favorite is the carne asada but close seconds are the chicken and barbacoa.  Try them with the chipotle mayo in place of sour cream.

On your second visit, come for the breakfast burritos.  The El Jeffe is phenomenal with egg, chorizo, smiley bacon, carne asada and eggs.  I got mine as a chimichanga (fried burrito) smothered in green sauce.  This could be a world beater if they fried the burrito harder.  Ask for it crispy if that is what you want.

If this restaurant was near D.C. Ranch, there would be lines out the door every day for lunch and reviews monthly in Phoenix magazine comparing others to this new standard for flavors."}
{"text":"We hadn't been here in many months but had always enjoyed the friendly staff and food.  We were surprised when we walked in and saw a whole new set of staff.  The menu is similar so we didn't know if it was new management or what.  You order your meal and they will give you samples if you are unsure what to order.  You choose the condiments for your meal.  We all got the 3 taco order.  The spicy chicken packs a punch.  There is a salsa bar and every salsa is hot.  I can't quite pinpoint it but the tacos did not seem as good as before.  Maybe the spicy taste was killing the taste of the meat.  It was good but not great.  The meal is cheap and I had leftovers.  Plenty of parking."}
{"text":"This is where you go when you're from SoCal and missing a great carne asada burrito. Great quality meat, flavorful salsa, and fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"Omg... amazing tacos... i had the 5 street tacos and it was delish! Choose the meat.. choose your topping. The food is authentic."}
{"text":"Very good taco place, decorations r pretty neat and the food actually taste authentic, also the the salsas are actually spicy and taste Mexican which most places like felibertos fail to do"}
{"text":"Awesome for street tacos ,quesadillas , had the Carne  Asada and Chicken vinegrett street  tacos , Yummy and quick friendly staff  loved it ! We will definitely be back ! We used to come here when it was another taco shop, (that one was awesome too) but this one has a bar !!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Had the 5 street tacos with tomatillo beef. Everything was spicy with tons of flavor. I think I've found my new favorite taco shop. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Well, so much for Most Wanted Taco Shop.  I've been to this place several times and loved it.  Decided to introduce my grown son to the place today.  It was Saturday, 11:45am.  We walked in.  The kitchen was in meltdown.  The staff was different  The menu was different (No more Pastor tacos for example) It gave every appearance of being under new ownership/management. After a couple of minutes waiting for the staff to get their act together, we decided to leave.  They had quietly locked the door behind us.  When I loudly asked \"Why is the door locked?\" the reply was \"We're not really open but since you are inside we will serve you.\" Closed at 11:45am on Saturday? I declined and asked to be let out."}
{"text":"[ [ s e r v i c e ] ]
A+! The employees here are always so friendly. They're also very helpful if you're not sure what you want.

- - meats - -
My personal top 3 would have to be green chili, barbacoa and carne asada! But honestly...I've tried a few other ones and they were alllll delicious! You can even ask for a sample if you want, but trust me...that might make your decision even harder since they're all so good. You'll just have to come back another time to try them all ;) 

- - d i s h - -
TACODILLA!!! OMG these are so good!!! I highly highly HIGHLY recommend the three tacodillas. The melted cheese truly does make a difference. 

Street tacos! Also a wise choice :D You get 5 so they're still plenty filling even though they're smaller. 

Honestly I don't think Mucha Lucha will let you down, no matter what you choose. As long as you choose to come here! :D"}
{"text":"This place is great.  Lots of meat and topping options.  We had had carnitas and carne asada on flour and corn tortillas for our tacos.  They warmed up the meat with a quick trip to the flattop and then added the toppings of our choice which were all fresh and tasty.  The end product was delicious and we went away very satisfied.  Mucha Lucha will see us again!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, quick service, food was excellent.  Got 5 street tacos which you can mix and match.  Good value as well.  Recommend!"}
{"text":"Yummy !! Great authentic Mexican tacos. Super inexpensive and the salsa is very hot ... I love that. Three tacos is more then enough when your hungry which is $6 total."}
{"text":"$7.95 for 5 TACOS? (Ok $1.75 for guac too but to be expected and definitely good portions of it per taco.) Count me in as a loyal regular patron of here!!! Any time I have a taco craving, Mucha Lucha hits the spot - AND it's so quick! 

To be completely honest, I never know which meat I get. I ask whoever the server is what their top two meats are, and then split my 5 tacos between those two. They fry the meat with onions on the grill, as well as the tortilla, so everything is hot, flavorful, and perfect for immediate consumption! I've been tempted to order some of the other items here, but haven't managed to be swayed away from the heavenly taco deal! I have tried some of my friends' other orders, but again - the tacos are maybe just a personal addiction at this point.

These are probably my favorite quick tacos in the Mesa/Gilbert area!! Coming from San Diego, where the taco options are aplenty, I've had to drive lengthy distances to get the tacos that hit certain cravings. But when I'm in AZ, I know Mucha Lucha will never let me down. So glad I live close by!"}
{"text":"Hubby found this restaurant and so glad he did!  We haven't found any food here that was less than spectacular!  Be careful of the hot salsa- they aren't joking that it's spicey!  I just wish they were open on Sundays too!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff
Clean Resturant
Organized, Great spot for lunch meetings 
Great Recommendation if your a bit choosy about choosing which dish to consume. :) pick them all!!"}
{"text":"In the former Filiberto's in this small retail strip, this Phoenix staple is now in Scottsdale. The restaurant is brightly colored, with colored cafe lights and (scary) lucha libre masks and pictures all around. 

They create your chosen dish much like Chipotle does, filling your plate, taco or burrito with beans, rice, salsas etc. Everything is super fresh. The shrimp cracked in your mouth (in a good way) and the salsas had a nice kick! 

The staff is friendly, though broken English if you don't know Spanish. 

Santos Lucha Libre is worth a try. A million times better than the taco shop it replaced. *Note: the sign is still the Filiberto's sign, so don't pass it by."}
{"text":"This place had supper yummy, fresh food for such a great price--like a better version of Chipotle! The portions were huge... I'll be full for days for just over $7. The service was fast and the people were perfectly polite and kind. I had a burrito with chipotle chicken (at the recommendation of the woman making it) and would also highly recommend it to you, dear yelp user. Will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I had been looking for tacos comparable to the fantastic ones we get in LA. By coincidence we came across this place and we FINALLY lucked out! After months of searching we found something with hot, fresh, seasoned food. They make everything right in front of you. We enjoyed some asada street tacos with chile that ACTUALLY has some kick to it. The music and environment are wonderful. 10/10 recommend if you're looking for some good, hot, fresh, tasty tacos!"}
{"text":"I just had a small pork burrito and it was so good and flavorful!! I'm obsessed with cafe rio but this place might beat it"}
{"text":"Yeah, this place is rad. Great food, friendly people, things are cooked right in front of you and you can get everything.

Tip: go here."}
{"text":"Favorite Mexican place in the neighborhood! Awesome breakfast burritos! Kids love the quesadillas! Tostadas are the bomb! And... simply the best rolled tacos ever! Alexa and Esmeralda are super nice and great cooks!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Good quality food and great service. I love that I can choose everything that goes into my burrito! It's like Chipotle But a true Mexican taco shop."}
{"text":"Great customer service and the food is delicious. The shrimp tacos are amazing. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I love this place! So many meats to choose from, bitchin' decor, and nice employees too. I've tried almost everything and have never been disappointed.  I miss living a block away from it."}
{"text":"My new go to neighborhood Mexican spot! The super nachos are amazing  

Shoutout to the cooks and and all the workers too. Everything was great! We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Best tacos I've EVER had. We get the carne asada tacos and they are amazing. My husband is addicted and eats here at least once a week! The meat is so flavorful and juicy and the homemade tortillas are incredible!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice since moving out to Scottsdale. Both times the food was great and so was the customer service. I was very glad to see that they don't make the steak until you order it."}
{"text":"Had this place for the first time and it was DELICIOUS! We had the sopes, macho fries and shrimp street tacos. Everything looked and tasted fresh and homemade. The carne asada and  barbacoa meat had a lot of flavor and the serving sizes were big. The place is small but has a great atmosphere. Definitely a must go to place!"}
{"text":"I always go out of my way to eat here when I'm craving quality Mexican food! It's amazing and the horchata is by far the best I've had"}
{"text":"Yummy!!! Finally found a street taco place close to my house that is decent. They have good toppings, nice salsa selections. It's setup is similar to chipotle where you order and pick what you like added. They fry up the asada meat on the grill in front as you pick your toppings.  My favourite meat so far is the carne asada. I recommended that they add horchata. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I got the street tacos and they were amazing there are many choices of meat I got the chicken and vinager shrimp tacos were fresh and delicious.  The taco salad was amazing and they made the Shell right in front of your eyes."}
{"text":"Good food, friendly service, and nice price.  This is not a \"sit-down\" restaurant.  It is more a place for a quick pitstop or taking the food to go.  However, the dining room, kitchen and bathroom were all clean.  I noticed one of the other reviews mentioned the place was not well organized.  That was not our experience.  Our 7 person group took our food to go and were in and out in 10 minutes."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure this used to be another Mexican food place a few years ago, because I definitely had been in there before. However, it was before it was Mucha Lucha with its amazing glittery luchador murals and counter tops. The man and woman who helped me were both very nice and didn't look at me weird when I asked for cabbage in my breakfast burrito.
It's set up like a Subway or Chipotle, where you order what you want and they make it for you with the ingrediants you choose. Since it was still early, I got the carne asada breakfast burrito which included egg, beans, cheese, and whatever other fillings and sauces you wanted. it was pretty big and was served wrapped in foil with a handful of chips. I also got a Mexican Coca-Cola. A very filling, delicious breakfast for under $10. I almost didn't finish it! 
It seemed to be a favourite spot of local construction teams, so be prepared to share the spot with a crowd of loud, dusty guys. But that's also how you know it's got to be good!"}
{"text":"Food is very good, takes a while to prepare though. Not a great place if you are in a rush or on a 30 min lunch."}
{"text":"Was driving by and saw this place and figured I would stop in to grab some lunch. I ordered the three taco plate to mild chicken and one mild pork. I was really excited to see they had pickled onions because I find that pairs well with the pork. The guacamole was delicious some of the best I've ever had. I will say that their salsa even the mild one was a little too spicy but that's OK there was so much flavor on the tacos I didn't need it.  tacos are delicious!"}
{"text":"I just tried a Baja shrimp burrito and cheese quesadilla with a side of rice and beans. I also tried every salsa they have. The salsas were all pretty spicy except the mild. Everything we tried was excellent and this was combined with friendly staff. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"SO disappointed! The hours here say they are open until 8pm. We had heard great thinks about this place and decided to give it a try. When we pulled up, there is a big sign that says \"NOW OPEN\". No one was in the place except for about 5 workers. The doors were locked and everyone completely ignored us. There were no signs saying they were closed and no signs regarding their hours. We knocked so we could find out what was going on and no one would acknowledge us. The least they could have done was come and say I'm sorry, we are not open. They looked our way and then ignored myself, my husband and 2 kids. 2 more cars came in to go there while we were waiting as well. If you aren't open until 8 pm as it says here, then you should change the hours. Very disappointed in the lack of service and communication."}
{"text":"I tried the burrito bowl with Baja shrimp and my wife had the flour tortilla tacos with carne asada and tinga chicken, all of it was delicious.

Customer service was amazing.

We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Real mexican food, tastes great made fresh right when ordered..
Breakfast Bowl with Tortilla ..
Baby Buritto  (Size of Baby)"}
{"text":"Best little taqueria in Gilbert ! Family owned and operated, and literally everything is super tasty. Great flavors and fresh- made to order. Our go to spot around town."}
{"text":"It was a little drive for me but the food was good. Not sure if it's worth the price but a fun experience. A few downsides are that it's pretty disorganized so the line moves slow. The place isn't exactly clean and there was no AC. However the service was friendly and accommodating and again the food was good. The carne asada street tacos were good and the green chili was spicy like it should be. The red, green and jalapeño cheese sauce on the bandera are excellent! Daughter had the carne quesadilla and enjoyed it. Not sure I'll be back but I heard they might put one in my area. If so I'll try the barbacoa next time."}
{"text":"Seen that their were good reviews on Yelp and had to try the place. The staff was very friendly and went through all of the different meats and I got 1 vinegar chicken, 1 barbaqoa, 1 chipotle chicken, 1 tomatillo beef. My favorite for sure was the vinegar chicken but all of them were pretty tasty. My girl got the fish tacos and a carne Assad taco which she enjoyed. Nice find!"}
{"text":"This place is sort of like Chipotle but better with a variety of flavorful meats, and they're willing to let you taste until you find your favorite, friendly staff and good fresh food need I say more"}
{"text":"So, I love Mexican food and I consider myself a connoisseur.

That said, this place has real Mexican food!
I got the 5 street taco's and they were awesome!
Everything is made fresh & you can custom order however you like.

If you are looking for yummy tacos, this is your place!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food!! Just moved here from socal and have desperately been looking for good Mexican food, not Texmex crap and this place is great. Awesome family owned shop."}
{"text":"Had the 5 street tacos and tried most of the meats. Their carnitas is amazing. Super authentic and a wide variety. It tasted just like what I had in Mexico!"}
{"text":"Super delicious! My husband is from Mexico and thinks this place tastes like home! Customer service is also on point! Definitely a new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"This is the most amazing taco shop I've ever been to and I'm from San Diego so that is really saying something. The only problem with this place is there is so many amazing options its hard to decide. The burritos are amazing, the tacos are amazing, the people are so nice and its all really well priced. Will absolutely be coming back whenever we have a craving for Mexican food. Do yourself a favor and do the same. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed this little place very much...we had the street tacos, wet burrito & super nachos.  I have to take one star off because the ordering process was very confusing & wasn't explained ( I have never been to Chipotle so this was new to me) & I couldn't hear anything the man was asking me, which made it difficult.  Be prepared to pick your meat filling & everything else as they make everything to your specifications. The menu was confusing as a result of all the choices & not knowing what was what when you looked down at the meats so a little challenging if you choose food visually...as a result things were hard to identify & I think they were insulted when I called their carne asada \"ground beef\" ( technically it was that shape/texture! LoL)  The street tacos were the best!  The wet burrito was huge with choices of hot or mild sauce on top ( we chose a little of both).  The super nachos were a little too much...could not even find the nachos under it all.  The most important thing is the food, itself, and that was excellent.  We'll definitely come back....very authentic Mexican food in a little hole in the wall type place that will surprise you with how good it is."}
{"text":"Yummmmmmm! I love spicy and I love authentic street tacos. This place is great! Tiny little shop with about a half-dozen tables. Not the fastest place but everything is worth the wait. Chicken Tinga for the win! We'll be back."}
{"text":"Hands down the best shrimp and fish tacos around.  I ordered the 3 tacos, mixed it up with 2 shrimp and 1 fish.  The fish taco was a huge fillet and cooked to perfection.  This is your place if you like authentic tacos!"}
{"text":"This place is no longer called Mucha Lucha, it's Maskadores or something like that. Along with the name change came a steep decline in food quality and especially in customer service. I've been there 3 times since the change and it's always a struggle for them to get an order right. It's also not as clean or organized. Sad because it was an excellent little mom and pop taco shop. Will no longer be going there."}
{"text":"Best tacos I have ever had (and I have eaten a ton of tacos)!  Gotta try the surf and turf"}
{"text":"Just had the weirdest twilight zone experience.  Went to try this place.  Open sign is on, you can see people inside but door is locked. We knock, nothing, no one responds.  Employees plus a dozen customers are in there no one looks. We thought maybe windows were to tinted to see us. Finally a customer tries to leave, messes with door, gets it unlocked, says careful they might yell at you. Employee says in an irritated voice we are almost out of meat. There is still like 10 people in line. I don't believe people there have a vested interest if so I can't believe it will be in business long.  The lady leaving said the food was good but we will never know. No food is worth be treated so rude."}
{"text":"This place was so money. I got the five street tacos. Super tasty and the green sauce is fire, literally. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have to agree the food is GOOOOD!!!  But if you want dishonest employees you got it!!!!  I asked for change for a twenty, so I gave the young man two twenties one for my food which was like $15 and the $20 for change..in the conversation he said he didn't have $10s but gave me 4 $5s...I counted the money in my wallet in the car and at home and was short a $20.  I called and asked him when he counted his drawer that night if he was a $20 over to call me!!!  He was like NO you didn't give me the extra $20.  How hard would've it have been to count his drawer that night!!!   I went about 6:30 pm on Friday March 4th."}
{"text":"Sweet baby Jesus. This place is amazing. Got the street tacos, favorite meat was the carne asada. And the churros?! Do not leave without them. The best I've had. I'm going back tomorrow before I leave town. THAT GOOD."}
{"text":"Came here on taco Tuesday and my god was I blown away! Nothing short of majestic. The flavor was just bursting in my mouth! I had the carne asada tacos on flour tortillas and like I said  the guacamole sauce is  also has a little kick. Did I mention the flavors just made me cream!  

Authentic Mexican joint. Love the atmosphere and pictures! Yummy in my tummy!"}
{"text":"I think I am still eating this two weeks later... it was SO MUCH FOOD. And so good. We got the El Hefe and the fajita mix burritos. They were the best I have had, all made fresh at our direction with super flavored rice, beans and roasted corn. Let me warn you that ALL their sauces are hot. I liked this but my co-pilot was burnt out...so ask for it on the side and proceed with caution. What a great option for eat in or take out. I want to try everything on the menu so I will be back...sent my friends here and now they are all fans as well. No bad experiences amongst them. Just raves."}
{"text":"Wow - just go.  Enjoy.  Enough said!

Ok so yelp appently wants me to \"type\" more...certainly never an issue now is it.  Just trying to keep it short and simple...so here it is again.  

Just go - it's amazing."}
{"text":"I've been to this place before & the first time it was the bomb! I got the same Bandero Burrito that I did this time, but I  got it with chicken. Bombness. This time I got it with the pork & a little bit of the red pork, & it was good, only because she got it from the back for me. I didn't even have to ask her. They have the meat warmed up on the line & you can try samples if you want. I tried the different samples of most of the meats, & everything was tasting burnt. I could tell by looking at the meat that it was over cooked, & sitting there on the line in the warmer was just over cooking it even more.

I didn't have to ask, but once she brought me a sample of fresh meat from the back, I ordered a burrito. The mild fresh pork was very flavorful. The red pork was pretty good. They got three stars because even though they used fresh meat for me, that doesn't excuse the fact that customers are getting burnt meat. You don't just serve food to serve it. You pull that food from the line if it's not looking or tasting good. It's all about having the BEST for every customer & not just me."}
{"text":"I was very happy with my first visit here. We will definitely come back...a lot. 

Service was personable, kind and efficient. The food tasted exactly like what my friend from Mexico would serve from her kitchen. Great street tacos and a very fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Pretty awesome taco shop for sure. I've come back a few times to try different meats and burritos, etc. Never disappointed."}
{"text":"This was hands down the best breakfast burrito I've ever had in my life ( el jefe ) we left pats run hangry and this cool joint popped up on yelp. If you haven't been here yet it's like chipotle for those who like real Mexican food not the gringo stuff. Everything was fresh, the servers were polite, the restaurant was clean, and we couldn't have left happier or fuller. I would most definitely suggest this to all my yelp friends and all of my real life friends too. Do yourself a favor and crush a burrito from here, I'm sure it's enough food for all day too because I don't think they know what a small serving size is here. We will be returning when we are in the area for sure. Also a small tip for those who like it extra hot, their habanero salsa has plenty of kick and it's not over bearing, step up to the plate because it's awesome."}
{"text":"I've been going to the ML Tempe location for a while and this location just pales in comparison. The ingredients are similar but the cook just isn't nearly as good as the Tempe guys and the service wasn't friendly at all. Ordered a quesadilla and the cook made it in about 2 minutes with no fillings versus the Tempe location the cook takes his time and asks you each filling you want. Tacos were the same deal, just not made the same here."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite taco shops in town. Super friendly staff and really good food. They have so many options to choose from. I got their green chili beef and it was great! I will definitely be returning again soon."}
{"text":"Okay. So my enthusiasm for Mucha Lucha isn't quite on par with what most people are saying in these reviews. Simply put, it's a reasonably priced \"fast casual\" taco shop that will probably add a bit of flavor to this otherwise \"dead\" area. And if your typical go-to spot is one of the 'Bertos restaurants, this is definitely a step up.

This appears to be one of three locations in the city and we chose this one since it's the closest to my house.

They offer a wide variety of meats for your tacos. We tried the carne asada, red carnitas, and barbacoa. The asada was, by far, the best - which often seems to be the case. I liked the red carnitas, although my girlfriend wasn't a fan. The barbacoa had a bit of spice to it, but not much actual flavor otherwise. I definitely want to return to try some of their other meats sometime in the future.

I also ordered a cheese quesadilla as an addition, which wasn't too bad. Their churros were pretty much your traditional churros - and there's nothing wrong with that.

The workers were both very polite and the food itself is very well priced. 

Recommended if you live in the area."}
{"text":"Yelp said it opened at 9 AM.  So we showed up at 950 and the posted hours of operation said it opens at 1000.  That's not a problem as I know Yelp is not always accurate.  There were 2 people inside setting up the restaurant so we decided to wait the 10 minutes.  At 1000 we noticed they had not unlocked the door so we decided to give them a couple more minutes.  At 1005 we walked up to the door and we're told they didn't open until 1100.  We said your hours posted on the window say you open at 1000.  We were then rudely told \"Ya but we don't open till 1100.\"

A business can open up whenever they want but not having there hours of operation accurately listed wasted a bunch of our time.  The attitude of we know it's wrong and dont care has lost it 4 local customers."}
{"text":"Food is great and so is the service. Cool environment. Would come back anytime. Recommend the street tacos."}
{"text":"This place is amazing and great service! I got the three flour tacos with red pork, red chicken and chipotle chicken. Honestly don't remember which was the best because I ate those too fast. My boyfriend got the bandera burrito with red chicken and that was tasty as well. Will definitely be my go to taco spot from now on!"}
{"text":"Went here the other day randomly with my girlfriend. I had the street tacos and she had flour tacos . First impression was the place seemed kinda all over the place; there was a definite lack of organization . The food was good I enjoyed the salsa some of which were very spicy. Overall decent taco shop. Not sure if I will return."}
{"text":"came here on a tuesday and NO taco tuesday ?? what the ! 
Ordered the 5 street tacos and got 2 carne asada , 2 of some spicy meat and 1 barbocoa ,,, the carne asada and the spicy one was really good but the barbocoa didnt have any flavor. I dont know the name of the spicy one because you cant understand the guy and they dont have a sign saying what each meat is. it would be really helpful if they had a sticker or sign saying what each one is, label them some how.. all 5 people in our group couldnt understand the guy."}
{"text":"My mom was in town and we decided to stop in for some lunch. I am SO glad we did! We both got street tacos and a nacho to share and everything we ate was spot on. The salsa is actually spicy without having too much vinegar, which is surprisingly hard to find. The nachos are enormous and are super flavorful too. Usually you get one or the other, but here they have quality and quantity going. Just a heads up, this place is small and it gets busy so take out might be your only option. Don't let that deter you, though. The food is amazing!"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of street tacos but these are very good!  The meats are all tasty. You get to pick your toppings.  The service was fast  they cook/reheat the meat when you pick it so everything was hot and fresh.  It was excellent!"}
{"text":"Thank goodness I found this gem! Mucha lucha is hands down the best Mexican food in the valley. The menu has something for everyone and the staff is the nicest around. They make your food to order so it comes out piping hot, with fresh ingredients, and very generous portions. I love the potato rolled tacos and the veggie tacos :) I highly recommend trying this place! I will never get Mexican food anywhere else!!! 
Also when you swing by make sure you try the jalapeño cream cheese as well as the hot green salsa. Delicious!!"}
{"text":"Owner was very friendly, I wasn't sure what I wanted so he gave me some samples. Overall great tortilla,very authentic tasting burrito. I didn't get a breakfast burrito but the person after me in line did and it looked awesome. I will be back."}
{"text":"Go here all of the time!  The staff are super friendly, the food is amazing, and the prices are unbelievable!  Let's start with the tortillas which are melt in your mouth awesome!  These guys know what they are doing and have so many options I've tried too many to list.  Let's just say that the fish tacos, wet burrito, and nachos are beyond!"}
{"text":"Terrific place. My girlfriend and I entered wondering if they had something vegetarian and they worked out the ingredients she wanted. I chose the Surf and Turf. We both loved our food. We'll be coming back, especially since you are close to where we live. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I ordered 4 hard shell tacos for 6.99. The meat, sauces, and toppings are set up like a chipotle. Everything is on display and I got to pick what I wanted on each taco. I was overwhelmed with all the options. There were 3 different seasoned chicken, beef, and pork options. It took me forever to decide and I was given samples to make it easier on me. I recommend the chicken mole meat. Seasoned perfectly."}
{"text":"Paid 30$ for food that was wayyyyy to spicy . Such a waste . Wish on the menu it said if it was spicy or not."}
{"text":"OH MY TACO! This place is AMAZING with emphasis on AMAZING! These are THE BEST tacos I've ever had in a restaurant. The green chile beef is to die for. The have great salsas too. If I could, I'd eat here more often!"}
{"text":"These flavors vibe so delicious together it's a party in my mouth coming back here had the Baja shrimp yum yum !!!!!! My co-workers had the wet burrito green and it was spicy she said but delicious!!"}
{"text":"This is great place and it gets busy so you might want to come a little early. The ingredients look better quality than most taco shops"}
{"text":"Exactly what you expect from a local place that serves more authentic Mexican food than the Americanized places all over the place.  You choose your ingredients, they make everything fresh, the decor is fun, the people are nice.  It's awesome!  Glad I stopped in.  In fact, it's taking all my strength to not head back there right now to try the breakfast burros.  Ok..I give....headed out.....peace out...."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place it is extremely close to my house I can walk, I just wish they had alcoholic beverages to enjoy with my food. The sauces are extremely hot so be carful. The steak has awesome flavor and they warm/cook your tortillas when you order. It is pretty pricy tho, but they are not tiny street tacos they are flour bigger tortilla's. I go back when ever I have a craving and I'm at home because of the convince. Thanks!!"}
{"text":"One of the best burrito/taco places in the valley (and believe me, I've been looking). The place is small and unassuming, but they have a huge amount of variety and their meats are amazing. Fantastic flavors all around I highly recommend them!"}
{"text":"Got the rolled tacos with chipotle chicken! The tacos were fried fresh and loaded with amazing toppings! Guacamole was perf and the store has such cute wall art! Goes with the maskadores theme.  Will be back, love how they have Mexican soda too!"}
{"text":"Excellent.  This place never falls to provide great food and service. Food is cooked to order."}
{"text":"This place was great!  I have been meaning to try it for a while and finally had a chance to for lunch today.  

The employee was very friendly, explained the menu, and even offered samples of all the meats.  They have a simple menu but it has more than enough options for anyone.  I ordered 5 street tacos.  I went with the Carne Asada and Tinga Chicken.  My wife got a wet burrito with Carne Asada.  Everything was delicious and more than filling.  I ate my five tacos and was satisfied.  My wife couldn't finish her burrito so I decided to indulge and try to finish it off but couldn't.  The prices were more than fair as well for the portion sizes.  Defintely better than most other taco places in Gilbert.

The interior of the restaurant was small but had plenty of seating for the size.  My only complaint was that it was very hot inside.  It is the first hot week of the year though so I won't hold it against them.  

I will definitely be back.  I have my eye on the quesadilla the person after me ordered..."}
{"text":"I have lived in Arizona for 13 years and have yet to find Northern California Bay Area quality Mexican food. I also typically avoid at the food court at PV mall. But this place is awesome. I had a delicious and fresh vegetarian burrito bowl. All the ingredients were tasty and I'm so glad I stopped at what appears to be a small family business. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Wow.... where do I begin?! This place is AMAZING, I'm so happy I came across it. Seriously if you want some bomb tacos you have to come here and order the street tacos they are soooooo great! My girl has had the rolled tacos as well and she loves them, honestly I'm sure everything here is awesome. This is by far my favorite place to get food whenever I'm craving Mexican, if you are ever in the Gilbert area this place is a must!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! All of the meats are amazing. I have had the burritos a few times and cannot complain at all! Its like a high end subway for burritos and tacos! I do admit sometimes the line at lunch is a little long but its well worth the wait! I will be back many many times! Up next will be the surf and turf burrito or the shrimp tacos which I saw in real life and instantly wish I would have got. Good job Mucha Lucha!"}
{"text":"First off, the food was great! I had the Asada fries and they were absolutely amazing. A down side to our experience there though was that the ordering was chaotic. We had a group of 6 and it was frustrating getting everything ordered and it seemed really unorganized. While it was a larger party I understand why it was like that. Also, if you want something to drink be prepared to pay for a can or bottle of soda. They do not have a soda fountain, which also means no free water. Another downside was that they charged us 75 cents for a sprinkle of extra cheese which was frustrating. Besides those minor fallbacks, if you are looking for great Tacos, burritos, nachos, fries, or anything else like that this is the place! I loved the food and I plan to go back."}
{"text":"We tried this great little place in the neighborhood last week. It was very affordable, and had a variety of choices. I have the fried fish on flour tacos and they were perfectly cooked. I like that you get to select what you want on them as you place your order. The place was clean, decorated appropriately, and the staff was very friendly. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing! Do the five street tacos you will not be disappointed!!! I could eat here every day! Real authentic Mexican street food!"}
{"text":"Mmmm my favorite place:) I come into the mall in my jammys just to get food from this place!"}
{"text":"If you are looking to satisfy your desire to eat a quality burrito the size of a small child, this is the place to go. Good quality food at an affordable price. Not to mention the environment is fun too. Perhaps the only thing I might want to see changed is how the water tastes strange. Other than that, the burritos and tacos we purchased were awesome."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in town!! You get to choose what you want on a vast choice of tacos, burritos, tostadas, nachos...and more! Super friendly staff!!
This place really has earned its stars!! Fresh food always!!"}
{"text":"Amazing tacos! the staff is awesome and happy to recommend different options and are willing to let you sample all kinds of the different meats so you can pick your favorite!"}
{"text":"Great street tacos huge variety of toppings to put on them very good service. Food wasn't overwhelmingly spicy as well."}
{"text":"Overall a positive first experience here last night. Was easier to find then I thought it would be based on reviews. They do have a sign out front and a branded van in the parking lot. My husband and I were waiting for a friend so we bellied up to the little bar. My husband ordered a beer off of the happy hour menu and I tried a mango margarita (pretty tasty but not very strong). Our friend arrived so we made our way to the other end of the restaurant to order. There were so many tasty choices that it was difficult to decide. I ended up ordering the surf and turf burrito, which comes with large shrimp and what seemed almost liked minced beef. I added lettuce, cheese, sour cream, roasted corn, pinto beans, and pico de gayo. The meat was seasoned well and the burrito was a very good size. My husband ordered the three corn taco plate but was misheard and given the five taco plate instead. He tried a beef, chicken tinga, and pork options and I sampled the meat of all three. They all had a good spice level and were seasoned well. Our friend ordered a wet chimi, again was misheard and was given a dry one, they ended up adding sauce on top. He enjoyed his and I had a very tasty bite of his, pretty spicy but great flavor. The portions were good size for the cost, all of the salsas were a bit spicier than I go for but really well done. The location is large, they had a dj (playing a bit too loud for us to hear each other over dinner) that played a good selection of modern music. I would return to try this place again, or maybe even one of their other locations."}
{"text":"I must agree with the other Yelpers, for a fast food Mexican place this is the Best! The set up is similar to  Chipotle . You pick your meat, rice, beans and topping. The difference is this is authentic delicious Mexican food. l can't wait to go back. Portion size is huge so I have leftover lunch for tomorrow"}
{"text":"I had tried to stop by several times right after they opened, but they were never actually open. The hours are a bit skimpy (10-8), but that's all that's skimpy. The portions are good and the meats are delicious. Everything is made to order. The line seems go be constant, which is a good sign. The portions of rice and beans to meat are legit and not too much. So far my faves are the burrito bowls and the tacodillas. The green chili is tasty, but too spicy for my wimpy gut. However, the carnitas, chicken and barbacoa are on point for me. The hubs loves the spicy and says that it's kicking!"}
{"text":"It's a little confusing where the line begins when you first enter.  

Once acclimated, the menu board takes a little bit of studying and you kinda have to strain your neck looking up at the menu board as your place your order.

Like Subway or Chipotle, you give your order and they start cooking or reheating, depending on the protein.  One customer at a time.

The setup is great for individual meals but can get a bit hectic when placing orders for multiple items. 

Despite the craziness, they managed to get my entire \"to go\" order put together with little fuss.  Felt a bit bad for the people in line, behind me, who had to wait it out a bit.

With the cooked food all packaged and paid for, I head to their excellent little buffet of sauces and peppers.


The verdict?

Probably the best Taco & Burritos I've experienced in the Valley.

In visiting many of the valley \"taco shops\", I'd give 5 Stars for flavor and bite.
- Asada - Burrito
- Asada - 5 Street Tacos
- Grilled Fish Fajita - 3 Flour Tacos
- Baja Shrimp Fajita - 3 Flour Tacos
- Sauce and Pepper Buffet

The only downer was the Shredded Pork.  It was a bit too salty.

Prices are reasonable and the staff was friendly enough, albeit razzled from trying to prepare multiple menu items.

Because it takes time to cook some of the meats and the tortilla, best bet would be to avoid ordering too many items.  Patience is key.

I will be back!"}
{"text":"The food is so yummy and the service is the friendliest! Far better than Chipotle! Wish I could eat here everyday! :)"}
{"text":"Thank my lucky luchadors to have discovered this taco shop; this place is awesome! Mucha Lucha's luchador themed restaurant has hefty portions and enough varied options to please even the toughest ring-side competitor.

The menu allows you to pick out your protein/base item and then what style you want your meal in. Meats included various styles of beef, chicken, fish, and shrimp, and there was one vegetarian option. After browsing through the menu I went with the rolled tacos with Baja style fish. Note that when you get the rolled tacos the meat/base item you pick out will not be inside the taco. The tacos are premade and filled with mashed potato and cheese and they will put your base on top of them.

My order started with a generous carpeting of romaine lettuce on the bottom of my bowl, then the rolled tacos, fish, and then whatever toppings I wanted. I had pickled onions, roasted corn, tomatoes, cheese, and chipotle sauce. I also had some guacamole for an extra $1.35. Off to the side next to the fountain drinks there is a salsa bar with green and red salsas, listed in terms of heat level. My personal favorites were the two green salsas which were \"hot\" and \"very hot\". 

The rolled tacos were a delicious combination of flavors and textures. I loved the light crispness of the deep fried tortilla with the soft creamy mashed potato filling. The delicate flavor of the white-fleshed fish contrasted with the bolder flavors of the pickled onions and chipotle sauce. The guacamole was very good and went well with the fish and tacos as an additional cold and creamy tasting component to the dish. It was actually such a filling meal with just the rolled tacos that I will probably order this without any protein for next time!

Service from the lady cooking my food and adding my mix-ins was dour, but everyone else working there seemed pleasant.

I didn't see any aguas frescas available in the beverage area but they do offer Coke products at the soda fountain and there is a small fridge offering Jarritos sodas and bottled water.

Since there are multiple locations throughout the valley, I'll be sure to visit my closest Mucha Lucha for more delicious eats!"}
{"text":"Best tacos I've had in a long time! Very authentic! The staff is wonderful as well! I have officially become a forever customer. The food was so good we all forgot to take a picture. Be sure to try anything with the grilled shrimp!"}
{"text":"I am in the area for work all the time so I decided to try this restaurant. I had the Carne asada Taco and a chicken Taco. They were amazing!!! I eat Mexican food almost everyday and am super picky.  I was very pleased with the temperature,  quality, and great customer service of everyone there!! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Really good food! I got the 5 street tacos and they were delicious! The employees were very friendly and thankful for your business. Come here if you want authentic mexican food!"}
{"text":"Amazing little Mexican place!! Stopped by for late lunch with hubby. Had their 3 flour tacos... 1 with Carne asada, 1 with green chili beef & 1 with barbacoa beef.. all 3 were delicious, but the 1 with green chili beef was my FAVORITE !!! Hubby had their meat burrito with Carne asada... it was huge ... he said it tasted great. You get a large choice of meats & they have a vegetarian choice too. Very fresh. We also tried the chips and guacamole with a small side of jalapeño cream cheese... their guacamole is amazing and the jalapeño cream cheese is the bomb !!! Casual sit down area. We highly recommend this place, we will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Order the Bandera Burrito!  Feel the heat.  Love this place..Always fresh ingredients at a fair price"}
{"text":"Went in and got the Bandera Burrito (Red & Green salsa) with Asada as my meat selection, the meat itself was very flavorful, no chunks of fat or bland taste. It was great carne asada. The salsa was very flavorful, although I might add the red salsa has some kick (according to my wife). 

Service was fast and I was treated kindly. Asked to sample other meats and did without hesitation. Might give the Tinga Chicken a try next time. 

They do however have a sign that says CASH ONLY,  just a heads up. 

This place deserved to have the same, if not better, grand opening than Backyard Taco. They don't even come close, as you can see all the hype is gone for that place and MUCHA LUCHA is where the Mexican food is at for my fellow Gilbert neighbors."}
{"text":"So the food is just ok. The street tacos and burrito were fine you get a lot for what your paying. I just think there are better street tacos out there. I enjoyed their salsa bar. I also love how the store is decorated. This place is kind of hidden though it's in the corner in the bashes plaza."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time today as recommended by my cousin. Me and my mom shared the 5 street tacos and they were delicious! It's hard to find good authentic tacos but this is the place!
Super nice employees as well!
Definitely will be coming back to try more of their food!"}
{"text":"I wake up everyday and dab (dance move the teens do now a days, one arm straight and other at 30 degree angle towards the head) I mean thank the lord all mighty and heavens above for the app known as yelp. First impression of Mucha Lucha: \"wow this might be my new favorite place\". It was a late night with the girls and we were looking for a good but cheap taco shop. Well guess what we found ... just that. The workers were inviting and understanding of our confusion. I 100% recommend Mucha Lucha to anyone and everyone even great grandma Mary ;) actually don't bring her if she's scared of manikin heads with wrestling masks on ahhh!!{:("}
{"text":"Was craving a churro and I know this place is good for its food but it's desserts? My churro came with a caramel dip. The crunch was good. The churro was good without the dip but even better with the caramel dip! To my surprise there was cream in the middle, however I do not like cream as well as I could not identify what kind of cream it even was. Without the cream it would be a 5 star, but the cream dimmed it down to a 4 star."}
{"text":"Checked out this new taco shop near by.  Went in not knowing too much about the menu.  The workers there were super helpful and gave great recommendations (since there were so many options!).  Food is made fresh to order.  We got the asada beef burrito bowl, green chile quesadilla and baja shrimp burrito.  All were AMAZING and SPICY!  Will be returning very soon!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!! Street tacos, yum! Fish taco, yes! Shrimp, oh yeah! The rice and beans are even good! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We tried this place on Saturday and we know we've found a new favorite. The store was packed, busy, and a little chaotic but that, to us, is usually a sign of good food. It's small and can feel a little claustrophobic when crowded. We recommend getting your food to go if you can and having some patience when ordering because they're just trying to get everyone their food as quickly as they can, which we appreciate. 

The menu was clear and we had trouble deciding what looked best! In the end we got a quesadilla and street tacos, all with varying meats just to try. The only warning I give is some things are spicier than your typical chain restaurant!  The tinga chipotle chicken was tender and had a slight kick to it. I picked a random meat for my quesadilla and it was amazing (think it turned out to be pork?) The carne asada was some of the best we've ever had and all the meat was warmed up on the grill before being added on the food. 

The salsa! They have a \"super hot\" green salsa that was so flavorful. I want a bottle of that stuff! And they had all the different toppings you could want. (Corn, jalapeños, cilantro, onions, cheese, etc.) With the price being a dollar more than Chipotle, we felt like the food was a good bargain."}
{"text":"I'm on a shrimp taco kick since my trip to Mexico. The jalapeño cream cheese is different but added a good flavor to the shrimp tacos. I also got rice and beans on mine (she asked, so I said sure). I ended up scraping most of it off and eating it separately since it made the taco super messy to eat. The shrimp does have a kick to it. Great hole-in-the-wall kind of joint with delicious food. This will definitely go in to the Mexican food rotation from now on!"}
{"text":"Every time I get a craving for shrimp tacos, this is the only place that comes to mind. Their shrimp taco plate is hands down the best. I've tried other items off the menu such as the carne asada tacos and mucha lucha fries and they're sooo good! If you're passing by the mall food court, you have to stop by here."}
{"text":"The best. So glad this place exists. Mucha is like a more traditional chipotle/taco shop. Great flavor, fresh ingredients, and traditional seasonings on their meats. You can't go wrong with the carne asadae, green chili or the surf and turf burrito. Pro tip: have them grill onions with your carne asada. Amazing."}
{"text":"Fabulous Food!
Ate there again to day and the food was just as fabulous and flavorful as the other times I've eaten there. I've had their street tacos & their regular tacos and they've always been good and the service has been as good as their food. Took a couple of friends of mine there and they raved about their food and service. Everything is made fresh and to order. We'll be going there again and again."}
{"text":"Legit taco shop . Awesome food and friendly staff. After eating at so many substandard places , this place was a breath of fresh air."}
{"text":"I'll start with the positives (I did give it 3/5 stars, which technically is a passing grade):

The place is clean.  The people seem like hard-working, honest folks, the kind you wish success to.  And the tortillas (used in the street tacos) are very good, possibly even made there.

As for the detriments, basically the food is not all that good.  The chicken chipotle, for example had a very odd taste (and even smell).  It was also dry.  I'm glad I only ordered one of those, I don't think I could've eaten a 2nd one.  The barbacoa simply didn't taste good, and the adobada was so-so.  The green chili tacos were the best ones of the bunch.  I admit that these main reasons are somewhat subjective.

But additionally, while I said the place is clean and the people hard-working, they are also disorganized.  It took an unusually long time for someone to get to the counter after I had gotten my food so that I could pay for it.  They had also \"ran out\" of aguas frescas, which was very disappointing.  This was at 12:30pm.  And the usual containers for them weren't even out in sight, which leads me to believe, based on the fact that they were running around the whole time, that they simply didn't get to make the aguas that day.  For a while they were also out of napkins.  Napkins!  And when I bought a glass-bottled soda, nobody could find the opener, so one of the guys grabbed his Rambo mini-knife and used it as a lever to open the bottle.  These are the kinds of things I mean by disorganized.

One FYI that has nothing to do with my grade:  if you are used to or looking for Northern Mexico style food, this is not your place.  None of the staples like asada, pastor, cabeza, etc.  And the meats like barbacoa and adobada are completely different than what you may be used to.  If you're very familiar with Mexican cuisine across the board, then you already know about these differences.  But otherwise, FYI."}
{"text":"Do you like flavor?! Do you enjoy flavors that are not the same as everywhere else? Not your typical mix of meats and beans...this is the place! How about a little spice in your life? Mucha Lucha in Peoria has all of this and a great attitude behind the counter. My first interaction was over the phone as I was searching everywhere for carnitas...a very spirited young woman answered my question with, \"Yes we have the best carnitas please come down!\" I arrived and was shocked! The look is cool very Lucha libre which is different. She began to offer samples and stating these are recipes passed down and the flavors are not comparable! I agree they are not! I felt the love let me tell you, and if you like spice you will to. Please take samples first. Tinga Chicken, Carnitas, Carneasada, and mucho fries....horchata was delishas well. I loved the variety of the menu, it was like chipotle but authentic and spicy! I love Mucha Lucha and highly recommend the entire menu!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! We ordered the chimichanga, nachos, wet burrito, and hard tacos. Everything was super delicious."}
{"text":"Omg ! This place is delicious!  I got the Carne asada burrito but with no rice and beans substitute with Pico De Gallo and guacamole. It was perfect ! I will be back probably tomorrow ha ha."}
{"text":"Great street tacos with several variety for your protein and toppings.   Green salsa is great!  Very friendly staff working.   Will be returning back for sure."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good, however staff make the menu a bit too customizable. I asked what normally goes in the quesadilla and he was like anything. ANYTHING? So I asked for corn, cheese, some onions, and cilantro. Came out good, but portions of the tortilla were burnt. The fries were good also."}
{"text":"Amazing. Went here based off of reviews. Have a hard time finding new places to eat. This place is amazing. The flavors are beyond and reasonably priced. I tried the marinated chicken tacos on flour and my husband got the Fajita Carne Asada Burro. The salsa was great too. We will be back!"}
{"text":"If you love tacos, burritos, quesadillas, or just plain good Mexican food you will not walk but you will run to this amazing gem! The assortment of meats is vast, the flavors are all insanely good, and the spice is just right. Before I even ate my meal I sampled three different meats and realized that this couple will be wildly rich once the world finds out about this little Mexican treasure.

It's set up kind of like a Chipotle, but the way it should've been done in the first place. There are a variety of choices of how you want to deliver their various delicious meats into your very soon to be happy mouths.

OMG guys seriously go in here and try it out! Sooooooo gooooood!!!

PS- Tyey are also very clean. From what i noticed, they cleaned the ladles and tonga after every single use. I've never seen any place do that. They must be clean freaks! Hey, I'll take good food from a clean restaurant any day!

Mmmmmmmmm!"}
{"text":"Tried a burrito there It would have tasted great had the service been better! The cashier was more concerned with the fact It was almost time to clean the. To providing customer service! Won't even give this place a second chance because the customer service was hirrible"}
{"text":"I went here because the reviews are good. I was disappointed. First thing. I got the soft tacos and the portions were all over the place. Ok amount of meat but my girlfriend got tons more on her street tacos. Then when I selected my other ingredients the lady who was serving me just threw ingredients down on the plate impatiently. I asked for salsa, and she filled up two 2oz containers, but one she filled up only half way. Well guess what... each salsa container costs $.75.  Charging for salsa and not even filling the whole container up... not cool.  So we get to the register and she keeps hitting me charge after extra charge without explanation and I keep having to ask what \"open food\" charge is...  the experience was horrible. Will never be back."}
{"text":"Made a quick stop in here on a cross country drive since it was right next to the hotel and I could not be happier!  Ordered the 5 street tacos with everything and it is delicious!  Much cheaper then I expected as well for such fresh ingredients!  Definitely will come back next time I'm driving through Phoenix!"}
{"text":"They used cold meat that has been sitting in the bins for hours. They literally picked up the cooked meat and threw it on the grill to warm up. Salsa bar was dirty. Tables dirty. Food was horrible, cold, and no favor. Do not get sick here."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal I don't know why I passed it by so many times. Ordered the Fish Tacos for an early lunch. It was great, big pieces of fish on top of rice and beans. They have all the standard extras to top with. Made for a very good and filling lunch. Next time will get the Surf and Turf, looked awesome. 

By the way this is a no frills place, just straight up good food in a decent setting."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service and the food was very tasty. Every dish customizable.
Sort of reminds me of a taco shop meets chipotle."}
{"text":"This place is everything you could want in a taco shop. They have amazing meat options! My wife had the burrito with barbacoa and it was outstanding! We will definitely be back!  Los mejores tacos en Peoria."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food.  It is spicy and delicious. I have tried all the meats in Tacos and Burritos.  The wet burrito is my favorite.  You can't go wrong with this place but if you don't like spicy you better let them know."}
{"text":"So I live really close to this restaurant, and it used to be a chain filibertos. And I didn't like it but it was an near by go to Mexican restaurant, Oh you know drunk food etc! But Mucha Lucha Taco Shop is so much more than that! They redesigned the interior, It's bright pink, makes you want to stay for a bit. Ordering is easy its if you were at chipotle, but you don't get the robot workers asking about tortillas and what kind of plate you want your burrito in. It's 3 workers I think one of them is the owner and maybe 2 other relatives. But other than that they really got it together inside and outside. Now let's talk about the menu, it's pretty simple to the point from tacos to burritos and they also ask you what you want inside your taco or burrito etc. I've been here a couple of times and I'm never disappointed! Hands down best food quality and service for a small local shop! Love it! Hope you guys enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place was alright. Everyone was raving about it so i had high hopes, but compared to the other taco places ive found i wont be back to this place. These tacos arent anything special. Again, plenty of other taco shops that are way better and cheaper!
The meat was dry and the tacos were so small. Maybe i came on an off day but it was enough to turn me away with the price and portion. The ladys working the place were nice and friendly, so thats a plus!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing food!! Just moved down from San Diego a couple of months ago and I've looking for Mexican food and I really didn't had find something that was like the Mexican food down from San Diego and I think I found it here. I felt like I was back home, Definitely coming back and I recommend it for people to try this place. They also have great music!"}
{"text":"Of all the taco shops in the East Valley, this is as authentic as you're going to get! You know this place is going to be good when the grandma is working in the kitchen! Everything is made to order and most of the meats are a bit on the spicy side, with the carne asada being the least spicy. If you are new to taco shops, the same spatula is used for all meats, just a heads-up gringos! Tip: If you go before closing, get there at least 15 mins early, as the doors get locked early if there is a long line. Can't wait to try this place again!"}
{"text":"My whole family LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVES this place! Great and friendly service. FANTASTIC food! Fun decor and music. This is definitely worth the 30 minute drive for us :)"}
{"text":"Many options and everything is good. Got street tacos, carne asada, barbacoa, and red carnitas. Very juicy and delicious. There are many options for toppings but I am a Taco purest so I elected for just cilantro and onion. A few different salsas as well. Spicy but not too spicy and amazing. I'd come here again without a doubt. Authentic and well worth the trip!"}
{"text":"I come here at least once a week. Love the authenticity, the genuine personalities of the owners and of course the food speaks for itself. Don't leave without a churro! Lol"}
{"text":"One of my fav places to eat now. Everything had so much flavor and reminded me of back home. The loaded chips are mmm mmm good. My mouth is watering just thinking about it."}
{"text":"I'm not gonna lie; I wouldn't have picked this place if my 17yo son didn't make me stop and get him food here but it was amazing!! He had to order for me because I clearly didn't understand how or what to order and there was a line. So I have no idea what it is called, but they were 3 rolled shrimp taco things with a Baja or maybe chipotle sauce over them?? Sorry not the best review I'm sure but damn it was good. Bonus: my son only needed 1 burrito to fill him up."}
{"text":"Food is delicious and fresh. It's a must try mom and pop place. We'll definitely be back here."}
{"text":"This is by far THE best place for amazing and authentic Mexican Food.  The line is out the door at lunch time and well worth the wait!!!  You have to try theor street tacos!"}
{"text":"Delicious tacos! I had the chipotle chicken and beef which were both so good. TBH, I didn't distinguish the chicken tacos from the beef but that's only because my tacos were loaded with spiciness. You can tone down the spice if you don't add the red sauce (located near the drinks). Deff go for the green sauce instead if you can't handle spice. This place has an awesome sit down area because there are here really cool decorative images of animated wrestlers on the wall. The service is also super quick."}
{"text":"This place is lit! I could eat here everyday, everything is so clean and fresh! The best part is, they cook everything right in front of you"}
{"text":"Best surf and turf burrito i have ever had! I could barely finish it. Very well portioned. Jalapeño cream cheese and chipotle sauce they have are a must!"}
{"text":"Seriously one of the best fish taco's I have ever tasted! Every food bite is customized-have it your way.  DELICIOUS!!  And the decor-fun!"}
{"text":"I picked up takeout from here tonight. It is a mom and pop restaurant. Reminds me of an authentic chipotle. I tried the different meats and really only liked one of the beefs (the green one) and loved the carne asada. I got the carne asada burrito and it was really good. It was huge so it will be my lunch tomorrow too. It also comes with a side of chips and salsa. Will definitely be back here."}
{"text":"PLACE WAS GREAT!! Old school homie vibe about it! Food was excellent cooked it fresh right in front of my face! I got the wet burrito with Baja shrimp that shit was incredible! The sauce is amazing and the ppl there are super nice and they're family owned it seems!"}
{"text":"Shrimp tacos were insanely good. Seasoned perfectly and large juicy shrimp. Will return anytime I'm nearby. Best Shrimp tacos I've had outside of Ensenada."}
{"text":"Omg this place was beyond amazing. Best Mexican food ever, it taste just like my mother in laws. I had the meat burrito and it was beyond filling but more importantly it was delicious. BTW did I say it was delicious?! Omg definitely going back tomorrow before I head home to Cali."}
{"text":"This food was really fresh and tasty. I got the 3 Asada street tacos in flour tortillas. I was able to chose my toppings. I want to go back and try more items. The lady working was very friendly. Place was very clean."}
{"text":"Mmmm what a good local taco shop. Plenty of choices from carne asada to chicken tinga to carnitas all very tasty. You can have them prepared in many different ways for instance in street tacos, quesadilla, Burritos, Flour tortilla tacos, and something they call a tacodilla which I can say from personal experience was very good. Careful some of the things on the menu can be spicy but if you ask they will definitely inform you which is and isn't. It's very clean inside that's a plus. Definitely stop by if your craving some good Mexican food."}
{"text":"This place is the best! We got the 5 street tacos and they were delicious! Will definitely be coming back here again!"}
{"text":"YUMMMMM!!! Very authentic, tasty and flavorful. Carne is delicious, especially on the nachos! Street tacos were good too. Staff was extremely friendly, but the food.... Soooo good. We'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"Wow! This place totally surprised me! The food is so good here! We ordered street tacos and rolled tacos with carne asada, red pork carnitas and pork carnitas. The meat is very flavorful and really good! The place seems to be family ran and they worked really well together. The paintings on the wall are really cool and I couldn't stop looking at them! Totally worth a stop in and trying out the food. A little disappointed I didn't get to try the guacamole because they were out, but I'm sure I will get it next time we are over here during lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"My wife and I shared the green chile beef and red chicken Street tacos, LOVED THEM! if you like spicy tacos this is the place. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place!!! better then chipotle and so reasonable. Food this place on Yelp and it's my new favorite lunch spot. They have breakfast to!"}
{"text":"Great tacos.  Had 5 street taco has some spice, not for Utah people.  Great flavor this is definitely a return visit.  Wife had tostada \"really good\"  hope you like it as much as we do!"}
{"text":"Great customer service and excellent food! I had the chipotle chicken jjs quesadilla with fixings. . My friend had carne asada quesadilla and my son carne asada burrito..  so yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Mucha Lucha is so fresh and good! They heated the steak up right there and then built the burrito... large portion for price and good amount of fresh hot chips on the side. Also loved the environment!"}
{"text":"This place is ridiculously good! Every flavor was delicious. The fried fish sope were so good. The fish was just perfectly cooked and crispy. The pickled onions are just great to add a delicious tart flavor. This is my new favorite place. The fifth star would have been there except hubs went to the restroom and said it was pretty bad. Just a bit cleaner, and I am not sure if I could resist eating here a few times a week."}
{"text":"Best tacos around here. Way better than backyard taco. LOVE the rolled tacos also. The barbacoa and the green chili beef are my favorite."}
{"text":"Really yummy!   Casual, low-brow but don't let that fool you!  AMAZING food!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I have ever had in Arizona!  Hands down! Don't know what to recommend because it's all so good.  Lots of flavor. Lots of heat.  Amazing food!"}
{"text":"Love this place , first time coming and the service and explanation of what you can get was great , the people are wonderful , the daughter is very talented. The atmosphere is just awesome , this is definitely a place to be for real tacos and a mexican meal !"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this is the best taco place i ever been in a while. the employees were very helpful and made sure to describe the menu very well to us. The food was awesome and the i loves the decorations in the restaurant. Definitely will return here next time i come back from Canada. I'm impressed!"}
{"text":"HOLY SMOKES! This stuff is SPICY! My husband and I both got the wet burritos thinking it was covered in enchilada sauce but OH NO this is hot sauce people! My mouth is on FIRE! Ingredients were very fresh. Staff a bit unorganized. Definitely set up for take out only. Very small amount of seating. Going for non spicy tacos next time... FEEL THE BURRRNNNNNNN!"}
{"text":"Ship didn't open on time, I waited 15 minutes! Not happy. They don't even have a phone number to call!"}
{"text":"Here we go. The perfect mix of chipotle and one of those quick Mexican joints that always goes by a different name, betos/rancheritos/Alberto's/Floribertos/etc.

I was absolutely blown away by the quality of food, the serving sizes, and the prices. I went with the el jefe and boy oh boy I was not disappointed. This burrito was absolutely stacked, and it is all so fresh and warm. If my memory serves me right (it's been 2 weeks) I got to choose rice and type of beans, it had chorizo, carne asada, cheese, some avocado and sour cream and the best spread of hot sauces you can imagine.

I really suggest you order the hot sauces on the side because you can burn your face off if you aren't careful. I ordered a couple of mild sauces and I was losing my head, and I can handle a fair amount of heat. The plate also comes out with chips so that was awesome.

My wife snagged a plate of random hard shell tacos and I was so surprised to see the cook drop fresh shells into the fryer when she ordered! They are always fresh and hot - never stale!!! That's incredible!

The other couple we went with had this random thought to snag a couple of churros and... frankly my life will never be the same. They come out with a little cup of caramel sauce, and it is the perfect amount of crispy and soft in the center. No words are even in the English dictionary that describe how good these were. My mind is still blown.

I would make this a habit of twice a week if I lived near by, and no food right now is a twice a week habit for me. Do yourself a favor and go here."}
{"text":"Authentic. Clean. Great prices and smiling faces. This is my new spot. Everyone should give this place a try."}
{"text":"Amazing! If this were in my neighborhood I might eat here way too much for my own good. Flavorful and tender meat in all options."}
{"text":"The Jalapeño cream cheese was an absolute treat! The street tacos were to die for delicious! We will be back here often!"}
{"text":"My first time here. I've been wanting to stop by for some time now. And I'm glad I did! 

I had the 5 Street Tacos, with Asada Beef. It was delicious, and everything tasted fresh and authentic.

The service is quick and you can watch them make your meal in front of you. You can also customize it however you like. 

I will definitely be back and try more of their options. And I highly recommend stopping by."}
{"text":"Mucha Lucha has the best Mexican food I have ever had! My fiancé had a carne asada & cheese quesadilla and I had macho fries with carne asada, rice, pinto bean, cheese, cilantro, pico de gallo, sour cream, cilantro dressing, and lime! Both dishes were AMAZING! Not to mention we both got medium drinks and we got free refills (even though the machine was behind the counter). They have incredible luchador-inspired decor and a cool/clean atmosphere inside. Highly recommend Mucha Lucha for all of your Mexican food cravings! :)"}
{"text":"Stopped by the other day .  Service was awesome.   Owners gave tiny bites of different choices.  Tons of meat and seafood .  Helpful.  Tacos were some of the best I've had .  Reminds me of Chipotle only tacos..  everything was so fresh . Nothing fancy but really good food .  Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"I came to the mall just to try this new place.  I got the street tacos. Their \"carne asada\" is not that, it's just meat with some type of sauce. The tinga chicken was good, A LOT better than the asada tacos! 

The gal that was cooking was so nice and pleasant! She was the only good thing about my visit here.  But the guy at the counter was extremely slow and didn't seem to know what the heck to do. It was a Saturday night and the mall was dead, I think he just needed practice. 

I love to support local and small business but certainly I like to enjoy what I'm eating and paying for.  I probably won't be returning for the tacos! Maybe just to visit the lady ;)"}
{"text":"Great random find for a filling and tasty lunch! Highly recommend you try the Surf and Turf burrito!!"}
{"text":"Great food, fav taco shop in awhile.  We had the street tacos, wet burrito, and chips and guacamole.  Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"It was lunchtime, so service was slow but understandable. The food is made in front of you and you can add whatever you like. Filling, fresh, and delicious. Also on Yelp24 a +"}
{"text":"Simple and delicious!!! Great portions for the price.  Check then out. My daughter already wants to come back for dinner."}
{"text":"Tried the green beef and the barbacoa flour tacos, along with a green \"wet\" burrito. Meats were wonderful and full of flavor. Did not like that I could not order a single taco, as the tacos came 3 to an order. Plus, I could only pick 2 meats for my 3 tacos. Would have loved to try 3 different meats. Also did not like plastic silverware. I hope for success for this little taco shop, but don't foresee it happening."}
{"text":"wanting to try something a little newer and hip to the area. This place is spot on if you want an amazing taco or other combinations of Mexican food. all the meats have amazing flavor, ingredients are fresh. Once you try them or you will be hooked I'm a regular"}
{"text":"This place has just changed my life in the best place possible... I've had it Two times now and the second time sealed the deal. Best tacos ever."}
{"text":"Love the Red Chicken Tacos!!! A little pricey at $250per taco. But really good. My son loves the Nachos as well."}
{"text":"Been meaning to try this place for a while. Only good things to say about our first sampling. I got the carne asada burrito and my son got a chorizo burrito. Both were very good. Definitely will go back to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"We had the five street tacos for $7.49.  I like that they make up the tacos right there in front of you. You choose the meets you choose the toppings on your tacos at whatever sauce you want all of it is made to order. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Fantastic taco shop perfect for a post-North Mountain hiking meal. Set up Chipotle-style where you point at your preferred ingredients, the restaurant has a distinctly homey feel and unlike the chain, it doesn't skimp on spice or flavor. Upon entering, we were greeted by one of the employees who chatted with us and gave us samples of the meats when we mentioned we'd just moved to the area. It also features a good beer selection (including a hilariously large Tecate Michelada) and a large dining room. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Baja shrimp burrito was as big as Mexico booming with flavor and screamed take another bite when your pants is bout to bust. I even watched the man behind the counter make it with passion and the lady was super nice to as they made sure to tell me good bye as I was wobbling my fat ass out the door.   I plan on coming back here often.  The critic has spoke.  5 stars.."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly and service was fast!  The food was amazing and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food and staff were absolutely amazing! Since it was our first time, we had no idea what to order. The ladies walked us through ordering and even let us sample the meat so we could make an educated decision on what we wanted to order. 

The tinga chicken was spicy but really tasty. We had it in the bandera burrito. The tortilla was so good. We had it with black beans and rice and most of the toppings. SO good.

We also had the street tacos with the carne asada and the barbacoa beef. Both were really good. The jalapeño cream cheese was super tasty and the chips were good as well.

We will be coming back."}
{"text":"Sadly... not even close to Lucha Libre in San Diego.  

Decided to try out the wet burrito (surf and turf) but the turf seemed to be missing or was very scarce.   The asada had too much salt or seasoning this day.  Normally I'm the one adding salt and pepper, but on my first bite I was almost done.  Luckily I had also gotten street tacos with 3 different types of meat.  They were good, but unfortunately again nothing to write home to mom about.  The pics I took look better than the taste this day.  Maybe there was an accident in the kitchen... who knows.  Worth a try for yourself and be the judge because the decor was pretty cool!"}
{"text":"The food was lackluster. The carne asada that I ordered was very plain almost just like plain beef from the oven. Somebody in line told me that the other dishes were good maybe I'll give it another try. The service was not friendly I speak English and Spanish but they seemed like I was bothering them and they pretended like they understood my English but then seemed confused about my order, and when I tried to clarify the order I seemed to be bothering them again. No one seemed happy to be working here. I'll raise my review once I try it again if they are friendlier or if one of the other dishes is good."}
{"text":"Saw the \"Now Open\" sign when driving near my neighborhood and decided to try it for lunch and I was glad I did!! I had the street tacos with carne asada for the filling and they were perfect! My dad had the flour tortilla tacos - one with green chile beef, one with red carnitas, and one with carne asada and he said he couldn't pick a favorite, that they were all good. The salsa is very hot, so if you're sensitive to spice proceed with caution, but the flavor is great and worth it, maybe just use sparingly. Will definitely make this a regular stop, glad it's close to home!!"}
{"text":"This is the definition of a hidden gem. If you like Mexican food, you absolutely need to give this place a try."}
{"text":"Wow! These folks know how to do tacos. I had the Barbacoa and the chipotle chicken timga street tacos. It was so good. The atmosphere is pretty awesome. If you want good food at great prices with quick service go here!"}
{"text":"Great portions and so yummy. We had the quesadilla which was huge and my two kids ate between them, the Bandera Burrito which kicked my hubby's butt, macho fries that were really yummy and taco salad. The shell was delicious and so was the rest."}
{"text":"I finally tried this place after driving by several times and reading the yelp reviews. The menu needs to be broken down a little more. My son only wanted 1 street taco and 1 quesadilla. Price and size no where to be found on menu. My son ended up getting a 6 inch tortilla instead of St taco size for $3.50 and huge quesadilla for $4.59. My son really liked the quesadilla. He didn't like the chicken taco. Said they need to work on their chicke. Like other yelp reviews I was told I can have only 2 types of meats when ordering the 5 st tacos. The guy behind the counter with glasses didn't take time to explain why he seemed he just wanted to rush me threw. I asked what is good and said it's all good. I ordered the Carne Asada and one of the pork meats the guy didn't want to explain the difference in meats. The woman behind the counter doing the toppings was very friendly and took her time. At the register was another man and I asked him why can't get 5 st tacos with 5 different meats. He said I could but it would be more expensive. Not sure why the other guy says No. The guy at the register also told me about a kids meal they have that's not on the menu on the wall. Includes beans and rice and quesadilla, drink for $4.99. The st tacos were on point, probably some of the best I've had. The salsas are all spicy and watch out for the fresh diced jalapeños, I was sweating. I will be back. I'm taking 1 star off for the way I was rushed through the line I will probably add the star back after future visits."}
{"text":"Tasty food! You can't go wrong with anything on their menu. Solid go to place when you are craving Mexican food. It's hot in this little establishment so we always order to go now. Be patient with their process. I promise it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Omg! These tacos are delicious. The place is clean. It is my go to taco Tuesday spot. Definitely recommend if you are in the area or even if you're not!"}
{"text":"I saw all the great reviews so I decided to try it out for lunch. this place is a bit pricey for what you get. I was never greeted or acknowledged right when I walk into the door. There were 2 people working and they did not pay me no attention for almost 10 mins. It was not at all busy in there. Only had a family of 6 and another group of two sitting down in the restaurant at the moment. The chef finally took my order. I just decided to get the macho fries (with Carne asada as the choice of meat) & a large size of guacamole. $2 for a large order of guacamole is a rip off. it's literally 1 tiny ice cream scoopful. the macho fries were alright. Not the best I've ever had. I did really like that they had a salsa bar though."}
{"text":"First time coming to this place and im very impressed not only with service but with the food! Their burritos are really good!"}
{"text":"I love it the women are so sweet and really cute I'm from Florida I've never gotten real Mexican it's cheap quick and easy and a lot of choices good location and laid back"}
{"text":"A nice little find. We were going somewhere else and there was a line up so we came here. A pleasant surprise. A nice variety. I ordered the breakfast bowl with Chorizo and pork with egg, potato all on top of rice and choice of black or pinto beans. Then additional topping thrown on!  Lots of good flavorful food!  Lots!  The pork was delicious!  Mmmm.   Someone else ordered a shrimp bowl. The shrimp was good!  Another order 5 street tacos and they enjoyed!  They do not give you any tortillas. 

I liked what I had!  There is a small salsa bar. Plastic forks and knives. I do not like that, but that is always my personal beef when I am in a \"brick and mortar\" establishment. 

There is a row of TVs. Tables and booths. You order up front and they make everything at the \"bar\". Then you choose additional toppings. \"Mexican Subway\"."}
{"text":"Holy moly!!!! The food here was amazing!!!! I loved every bite, the meat was extremely flavorful, the ingredients fresh. And the service was fast and friendly. I walked in and there was only one person in there so I'm thinkin...oh great it's empty the food must be so so....boy was I wrong. And literally right after I walked the place filled up. I made couple of choices asada tacos and chicken tacos, at first I thought, the meat didn't look like I'm used to so I was apprehensive. Then they threw it back on the griddle to heat it and crisp it a little so I'm thinking ok that's different. I also ordered the super nachos, they fry the fricken chips there in front of you!! Amazing!!! So I get home take a bite and WTF!?!? The meat was so flavor full and and tasty I've never had taco meat so good!!! I mean packed with flavor! And the nachos were totally delicious too!!! The guacamole is so fresh and snob worthy(it's a thing). If you haven't eaten here you are missing out! The food here is fantastic! Get in there today!"}
{"text":"Food was very good but the service not so much. It was our first time there and the ordering part is a little different. They were not busy and they made us feel like we were bothering them by being there. We thought we can just order several different street tacos but that's not allowed (I know, weird, right) I then asked if I can just order 1 potato rolled taco to try it and the gentleman said, I don't know let me ask her (his wife I'm assuming) and I never got a response and never got a potato rolled taco. The wife looked mad the whole time. We never got a thank you, come back and see us again. Highly disappointing"}
{"text":"Decent Mex carryout,  big on fillers ,if you don't want beans, rice, sour creme,and want a good  large meat burrito,with cheese,cilantro,and peco.in my opinion ,it will be half the size,and is no bargain,if you like all the fillers its worth it."}
{"text":"Love Fernando and everyone that works there! This is the best Mexican food I have ever had. Come back at least once a week!"}
{"text":"This place is great! A pretty nice sized salsa bar, a huge meat and seasoning selection to go with any entree, plentiful helpings, and tasty foods. There is some serious quality and value for the dollar at Mucha Lucha!"}
{"text":"Everything is homemade and amazing.  Good portions, and the staff is very friendly. Don't forget to get some horchata!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on our way back from the botanical garden and very glad we did. I had shrimp tacos w/peppers and onions. Great flavor...so many choices for street style food that was well made and a good value. The lady added jalapeno cream cheese to my tortilla- that was a new one for me and yummy. Shrimps were also large and tasty. Definitely recommend if you are in need of a quick bite that will fill you up!"}
{"text":"So. Freaking. Good. Every time my boyfriend asks what I want for dinner my answer is this shop. So many different options and everything is super fresh and yummy  thank you so much Mucha Lucha!!!"}
{"text":"If you want some amazing tacos there's no better place to go in Phoenix. The street tacos the best I've had in a very long time. P.s. they have a huge painting of rey mysterio on the wall which is also awesome"}
{"text":"Very tasty meat, especially considering you get 5 street tacos for 7$. Barbacoa beef was on point and the Asada was tender. The man that served me was very friendly and hooked me up with all the fixings. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Came here after reading other reviews and I was NOT DISAPPOINTED.  My husband and I ordered burrito bowls.  I got the green chili which was perfectly flavored. My husband said it was a bit spicy, but I thought it was perfect.  They have a great chipotle sauce to add on top, which added a great level of flavor.  The best part was their perfectly salted and crisp chips.  They were the best I've had."}
{"text":"This place is awesome... hands down, period. Family run and operated by awesome people. They will give you samples of the 9+ available meats that they use for their tacos, burros etc... All high quality and independent. Awesome Horchata as well... ask for it. Support local biz!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why nobody told me a new taco shop opened within walking distance of my house, but needless to say, when I saw the \"taco shop now open\" sign, I knew where I'd be having lunch today.  

I ordered the 5 street taco plate for $7.49 (which at $1.50 a taco, is a pretty legit deal) and they were incredible!  In the top 3 best tacos I've ever had, including in Mexico.  The staff are extremely friendly and courteous, and will customize your tacos with various toppings and salsa's, or leave em plain so you can utilize their salsa bar which has lots of amazing choices, including some incredibly spicy options.  

The only disappointment was they only allow you to pick two meats for the 5 taco plate.  Normally, not a big deal, but this place has a lot of really great, and unique, meat choices.  I had the carne asada and tinga chipotle chicken, both of which were incredibly tender, moist, and succulent (yes, succulent), but I really wanted to try their barbacoa, green chili beef, and red carnitas.  Good thing I loved the food so I can go back and try the other meats.  

I would run, not walk to this place... like right now.  

Hours are 9am-8pm every day just FYI.  And they are having problems with their phone system so if you're trying to call in a to-go order, you may not get through.  Not a problem tho as it only takes them about a minute to prepare your order."}
{"text":"fabulous true authentic food. you can savor each ingredient which ever order you decide to choose. and employees are so genuine nice.
awesome food and i'm picky about mexican food.
 their street tacos were a delight too savory.
thank you see you again soon"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem!! There needs to be more Mexican places like Mucha Lucha in Scottsdale. The food is top notch authentic Mexican. Get the chipotle chicken chimichanga"}
{"text":"Finally got to check this place out. I had the 5 rolled tacos with asada beef. He had the street tacos with red chile pork and Barbacoa. I've never had rolled tacos stuffed with potatoes and cheese before but it makes sense when you see their concept. They're like chipotle where you pick your various toppings or filling if you get a burro. The asada beef and red chile pork I tried is a little salty for my taste buds.  But the various toppings made it tasty. Only thing is all of the salsas had a kick. Even the mild and I can handle spice pretty well.  I tried to drown the saltiness with some salsa and ended up with a burning mouth lol. 
Service was good. We were the only people there so it went smoothly. When you order the meat you want, they warm it up on the flat top. I can see this being a problem if there was a long line of people. 
Overall the food was tasty. Not sure if I'll be back though."}
{"text":"Had the street tacos and my wife had a Taco salad.   Honestly, for great authentic Mexican, this is a great place at a reasonable price.  Nothing comparable on the west side.  They are supposed to have 10 locations, but the cook and server at 7558 TBird are great.  They cook in front of you at the counter and putting the meat on the grill is unique and serves the food hot.  Will go back."}
{"text":"This is probably the best Mexican food we have had in the valley. They have a variety of proteins to choose from and each have great flavor. Whether you like mild or extra hot Mexican food, they have an option for everyone. Reasonably priced and the staff is extremely helpful. Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"Not only were the spicy chicken tacos tasty, but the staff were a breath of fresh air. They gave us tasters of something not on their menu right now, they kept making sure I enjoyed the tacos. I will absolutely return and heavily recommend that you try the food! They will have you test the meat and almost anything you want to ensure you get what you want!"}
{"text":"Best tacos around 
Great tacos they taste so fresh and just the right amount of spice to them, they just hit the spot not too greasy like most other places. 
The green chile shredded beef was what I had and washed it down with some Coke."}
{"text":"Amazing.

The reviews speak for itself but let me tell you I love spicy and their mild kicked my ass."}
{"text":"This place is the best thing about PV Mall - I always go for the street tacos with everything on them. The closest tacos of this quality are from El Fuego on Bell and 23rd street, so when I'm in need of tacos and don't want to drive, Mucha Lucha gets the job done. If you love tacos and drinking Fanta out of a glass bottle you'll friggin love this place..."}
{"text":"Have lived in this area 14 years and have seen restaurants come and go from this location.  Went there for take out tonight and It was SUPER yummy!  Tinga chicken!  We had great service too!  Hope they are here to stay."}
{"text":"Oh my oh my oh my!!  This place truly Rocks. I am a total lover of legit street tacos and these are some of the best. Be for warned when they say hit they mean it. The Tinga Chicken is the best I have ever had.  

Being a Realtor I surf Yelp when I am in a new area, saw the reviews and had to try this place and I will come back again without a doubt!!!"}
{"text":"Good food, great atmosphere.  I loved the luchador theme with glitter on the walls and the food was pretty good too!"}
{"text":"This place is Awesome, great tacos & quesadillas.
If you love hot salsas, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Super delicious food, tons of options, perfect for take out. The staff was super patient  and told us what everything was for our options. Kind of like subway style  ordering, but tacos and better."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. Tastes like home cooked the way my mother in law makes it. Contemplating what I am going to have tomorrow for lunch from here. :)"}
{"text":"I was gonna give this place a good review, but then tonight I went by at 6:45 pm, and they were closed. Saturday night. Taco place, closed by 6:30. It says they are open until 8 tonight on Yelp. Lies. I wanted tacos all day, and I ended up having to go to filibertos, and now I feel all fat and gassy cuz that's what filibertos does to a human body. Thanks mucha Lucha, I don't have high hopes for you to be around long if you wanna close up shop at 630 on a SATURDAY."}
{"text":"The food is outstanding, We are new to the area and this has instantly become one of our favorites. Exceptional service overtime we have been."}
{"text":"Food here is fantastic.  They have tons of options, but I can't seem to get away from their carne asada street tacos.  Very flavorful and moist.  Their burritos are amazing too.  My only complaint would be that their salsa, while delicious, is freakishly hot.  Mind you, I love spicy, and am very used to eating spicy food, this stuff melts tongues.  Would be nice if they had one that was one notch down.  Decor is a bit odd, but the employees have always been polite and the wait time is almost nothing.  Very good eats!"}
{"text":"Very flavorful, authentic, and tasty. I got the 3 flour tacos. I loved the different options for toppings,  meat, salsa.  I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Delicious. Great menu and love how you can get a big  taco plate without the sides of rice and beans. Had street tacos and the sopes. Sopes were delicious"}
{"text":"Soooo yummy !!! This is the best Mexican food I ever had. I tried their street Tacos and wet burritos. Their hot sauce is to die for. Very friendly crew. I can not wait to go their again. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Burrito. wet. Red sauce. Both types of beans, rice, cilantro, Serrano peppers, white onion, corn, cheese, cilantro dressing."}
{"text":"GREAT tacos and burritos! Friendly staff.  Can get busy so best to go at off times, but note they close kind of early.. 8pm"}
{"text":"So delicious!! Customer service was great, super friendly!  The tacos were different than your typical (fill blank-bertos) 100% recommend"}
{"text":"It's a nice place probably a bad location but worth the visit. It's fun and has a live band. The food is super spicy but delicious. I had a fun night with my wife and her coworkers. If you choose to visit here ask for Greg. He was awesome!"}
{"text":"The large (it's like a 3 pound food baby) Mexican burritos here are packed with flavor and done right! We tried the surf and turf which had large shrimp and steak over rice topped with salsa and corn. You won't be disappointed. Definitely coming back again before leaving Scottsdale. Super tasty and a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Delicioso! Lots of different meats to choose from, plenty of jarritos and great luchadores art throughout the restaurant. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service only complaint is the system went down during a transaction but the food is well worth the wait"}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by a friend and I decided to give it a try after viewing it on Yelp. Let me say that I am still a huge chipotle fan but if you want a change or want homemade tex mex or traditional Mexican cooking then this is an awesome option! I got a barbacoa burrito and it was absolutely delicious! They have so many different meat and sauce options! I wish they would give you more cheese or explain their extra charges on a board but this place was incredibly tasty! It was full of wonderful staff who were friendly, helpful and humorous. If you are in the area you need to give it a try! I would go back."}
{"text":"The best street tacos you can find in the Paradise Valley area. The main short skinny lady is bilingual and super friendly to ask questions about the food. This is my fourth visit and I'll definitely be coming back again for more."}
{"text":"Was given a recommendation to come here for tacos. It is a hole in the wall and I must say the street tacos were delicious. The very much delivered on my taco need. We got 5 different meats and each was better than the last. I can say I'll be back when my taco craving comes back."}
{"text":"Best in town. Such amazing Mexican food. Wow. I'm impressed! I had the chicken street tacos and shredded beef burrito. Amazing."}
{"text":"This place is going to be our new favorite spot! The food is so delicious and the people who work here are super friendly and talented!"}
{"text":"A really good choice for authentic street tacos. Would have given them five stars but my pork tacos were a bit dry. Still really tasty but just a tad short of perfect. I'll be back and hopefully they can juice them up a little and earn that fifth star."}
{"text":"Very friendly service...quick and good and pretty inexpensive to boot! Carne tacos good..barbacoa better for me.  Quesadillas very large and tasty!!"}
{"text":"Six different meat options. Each pack a lot of flavor. I'm a fan of spicy so my favorite was the green chile beef. I ordered the 5 street tacos to taste 4 of them.  Five tacos for a little over $8 is reasonably priced, but they skimped on the meat portions compared to many other restaurants that serve street tacos. 

Also, on the meat and salsa there is quite a bit of a learning curve for first time guests. Sampling really caused a delay for those waiting in line. And the owners have a tendency to add an extra charge for everything (ex. one extra small cup of salsa, a plate of 10 tortilla chips, etc). Still seems like they have a few things to figure out on the customer service side, but the food here is excellent!"}
{"text":"Love their carne asada street tacos and mucha fries. Food is always fresh and the salsa is Spicy!!!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our food here today. I was a little skeptical because there wasn't a lot of cars in the parking lot, but upon entering most people doing taking out. We are picky when it comes to Mexican food, and we were impressed by this fast casual restaurant. We will be repeat customers."}
{"text":"Amazing tacos and exceptional customer service. The carne asada street tacos are delicious, will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Such a lively establishment, food is wonderful 
Warm inviting family owned establishment. All of their food looks very tasty. I had the shrimp burrito and added Carnitas. Very tasty. Will be back."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb! It is very small and seating is limited, but who cares when the tacos taste like this?!

I heard good things about Backyard Taco and was super excited to try it, but was really disappointed with everything I tried, so I came in here with tempered expectations. There was no need to temper expectations at all. I had the street tacos with a mix of the carne asada and the red pork carnitas. I could literally eat either of these meats plain, they were so flavorful! Topped with red onions, pico, cilantro and cheese on fresh grilled tortillas made them unbelievably good. My wife had the soft flour tacos with barbacoa beef and tinga chicken. Let's just say she finished her whole meal and she never does!

Skip the size and fanciness of Backyard Taco and come to Mucha Lucha Tacos to fight your hunger!"}
{"text":"Street tacos de carne asada were really good. The salsa's are very good, but be careful they're HOT!"}
{"text":"Love the food so much. Small place and I always see 1-3 people working but the food they put out is amazing. I really enjoy the carnitas tacos and the fresh ingredients. We order here at least once a month, sometimes up to 2 times a week. Very small shop but they make up for it in taste and flavor. Very nice people, support small businesses. 

:)"}
{"text":"So incredibly YUMMY! High quality and excellent service.  It's difficult to say what's the best so try everything! The tinga chipotle chicken is off the hook!"}
{"text":"The day was 5 of May... AKA, Cinco de Mayo! This place looked promising and it definitely did not disappoint! I had the 5 street tacos; two carne and three pollo tacos each in different sauces. The meats were all tender and the sauces were very flavorful, the toppings were like chipotle style where you pick it out but was so much better. My boyfriend had the surf and turf burrito and it was ginormous and delicious. They cooked the shrimp and carne right in front of us and it tasted fresh and the burrito was overall very very good. I'm sure everything on their menu is just as delicious as what we had. This will now be our go to for authentic Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Cute, clean and simply delicious! We tried the chicken taco, barbacoa and a pork. There were 4 types of chicken, 3 pork and 3 beef. Then...soooo many choices of toppings. The staff was friendly and the prices were fair. Check it out for sure!"}
{"text":"The carnitas street tacos were really good. Skip the guacamole- not good... watery and too many tomatoes. It's similar to chipotle for ordering."}
{"text":"This place is one of the best taco places I have been to I give 10 stars. It's like Chipotle but 100x better. They let up choose between like 10 different styles of meat. Prices are good. As soon as I walk in everyone looked happy to see me. They loaded the plate up. Plus they have an entire bar full of different sasuses . I will DEFINITELY be coming back here. High quality low pricing"}
{"text":"I cant believe I have not reviewed Mucha Lucha yet! I eat here at least 3x a month. I always get the same thing because it is so good I always crave it. I found out I have a gluten allergy about 6 months ago and was pleased to find out that Mucha is gluten-free friendly. If you are very sensitive I would not recommend. However, I am not and I have never gotten sick after eating here. The carne asada is gluten free so I get a carne asada burrito bowl with rice, beans, toppings and some warmed up corn tortillas on the side. It was THE BEST. The owners and workers are always so nice and accommodating. Definitely has a family run vibe. My favorite take-away spot in the south scottsdale area by far."}
{"text":"This spot was amazing- the service came with a smile and the younger counter person was ABSOLUTELY confident that we would like their food!  The Baja shrimp was cooked with love to perfection and the Tinga chicken was flavorful and brought me back to Mexicali and visiting mi familia!

At a conference in town and trying to plan how we are coming back for mid-breakfast or lunch and be back in the conference room on time!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good! I got a breakfast burrito with no meat, which was good but I probably wouldn't do it again. I'd get meat next time. They have a little more variety than places like chipotle and it tastes much more authentic. They cook the veggies and everything on the grill right when you order, which is awesome. They have several locations in the valley, so I'll definitely go again."}
{"text":"Awesome wet burritos!  Place was great and food was awesome.  Love the decor!!  Would recommend this place for authentic flavour and presentation.."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!!! 

It is set up like chipotle- except everything is home made and super fresh. I have ordered from here a few times and usually end up sharing because the food is SO good. Not to mention how HUGE the burritos are. 

I have had a steak burrito and a chicken burrito. Both delicious! However, I think my first order is still my favorite- I ordered a few different tacos including their shrimp and fish. Amazing!"}
{"text":"Have yet to be let down here. Food is always good. Salsa's actually have some heat to them which is a nice change from the normal. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I like my spicy and the green chile beef met the bill. Whether street or flour tacos or a burrito it is all delicious."}
{"text":"The burritos are huge and delicious! The street tacos have the perfect ratio of meat to tortilla. BUT YOU have to try the churrro!! Amazing!! Fried to order served with caramel sauce. Heavenly."}
{"text":"The tacos were fresh and hot off the grill. The nachos were almost to much to eat. The chicken was some of the best slices and marinated I have had in town.i would like to go back and try the shrimp tacos and the wet burrtio. I forgot to mention the happy hour beers from 3-6. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"First time here for lunch.  The meat fillings all have great flavor!  I'm a taco lover so I am sold!"}
{"text":"The service is great and the food is even better! Family-owned and definitely friendly owners. Traditional Mexican food. Great tacos, burrito bowls, rolled tacos... it's all so yummy! I would definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"Just found this place.   Love it!  You order your food and then tell the cook what you want on your taco (or whatever), kinda like subway- they have several choices.  I evidently make mine a little different LOL!!  But the food was Outstanding!!!  I will be back when we come to town!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good macho fries and the jalepeno cheese dip is super good. Will be going back to try tacos because they looked delicious"}
{"text":"Went here today for lunch with the husband. The tacos were decent... nothing super special. The prices were EXTREMELY high!!! Paid $20 for two orders of 5 street tacos w no drinks. The staff was nice, not too friendly. Wouldn't go back or recommend."}
{"text":"I tried the street tacos they were delicious! I am gonna come and try other things that are on the menu. But with sooo many good ratings about this place. I doubt I won't walk out not being satisfied. My friend ordered a breakfast burrito, she liked it so much she said she would rate it a 5 star. 
It's almost like chipotle where you get to choose what you like in your tacos or burritos. The tables are clean and the interior is design with men wrestlers (Lucha libre). It comfortable...the people were friendly."}
{"text":"The barbacoa was super spicy and I am a Sriracha fiend! Their carne asada is really good though! I always get the street tacos."}
{"text":"Ordered the 5 street tacos, tried the carna Asada, Barbacoa and Green Chili. 

The Green Chili had a little kick, the Barbacoa was good but I prefer the Carna Asada. It had a good flavor and flavoring yet not to spicy. 

As far as a mall restaurant it was not to bad and the price was average.

Would like to come back to try other items on the menu another time."}
{"text":"This place is great, especially considering I get the veggie burrito. Not every place can do a good veggie burrito. Good pinto beans, cilantro rice, fresh ingredients like jalapenos, lettuce, guacamole. The salsa bar has a great selection of mild/medium/hot/extra hot salsas. The people running it are very polite and enthusiastic. My only complaint is it's a bit hot in there. One ceiling fan would probably make all the difference. Some beer would be nice, too."}
{"text":"I order chorizo breakfast burritos at every taco shop I visit and this one serves the hands-down best. I live 30min away from this place but I'm going to drive here again tomorrow. It's a pretty authentic place, and it's super cheap, and it has a nightclub that's probably awesome."}
{"text":"This is a diamond in the rough of Mexican food with in Scottsdale. I tend to shy away from shrimp tacos in Arizona for fear of subpar seafood but this was far from that. The shrimp was juicy, huge and flavorful! All the accoutrements were flavorful and authentic, we also had the breakfast burrito and it was just as amazing. The staff was beyond friendly and a tentative. I recommend the horchata as well! This place is a real Mexican food Chipotle style restaurant and I recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"Much Lucha is an awesome Mexican restaurant.  If you live on the west side and like Mexican food check this place out!  I had a bandera Carne Asada burrito and some flour tacos (shared).  Everything was excellent!  Great flavor and spice balance.  Try the salsas.  I will be back ASAP!"}
