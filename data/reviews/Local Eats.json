{"text":"Recently, I went to a local place close to my house called Local Eats. They had food ranging from different cultures. Italian sausages, ricotta cheese, basil, all unique ingredients to create the flavor of your choice. They make their own ciabatta bread every day. The place had a nice vibe to it. It was decorated in a modern, southern way which carried its own home presence. The staff was amazing with how they actually cared to talk to me! The managers really know what they are doing there. Big thumps up for me. 
 They have pizzas, salads, sandwiches, soup, and kid's meals. They have so many things customized to different flavors and cultures. The names for the food are pretty interesting.. For example, the forager, the baller, the red rooster. They definitely created masterpieces. They also have a nice selection of alcohol. This place is family oriented so they don't have too many options but just enough. Every time I have gone to Local Eats with someone they became just as obsessed as I was! I see many regulars always in there.
 My all time favorite is the pesto chicken sandwich. The pesto chicken sandwich has artichokes, pesto, lettuce, chicken and cheese. All of those ingredients warmed up is pure heaven. They also have a caprese sandwich with no meat. It comes with mozzarella balls, tomatoes, pesto and balsamic glaze. Talk about unique combinations. I love how they can substitute items with no problems and make it to where you can get exactly what you want each time. They are very customer friendly and I am glad I tried this place out."}
{"text":"Awesome little spot less than a mile from the house. Fresh local ingredients used in all pizza, sandwiches and salads. Have tried quite a few of the pizzas and sandwiches all are awesome. If you are close stop in you won't be disappointed. If you are not close plan a trip it is worth it."}
{"text":"Would DEFINITELY recommend & come back! Went with the Baller, hubby got the Ultimate. Both were tasty (I enjoyed the Baller. Maybe I just like saying it?) lol 

In all seriousness The Baller:
the meatballs were homemade delicious, ricotta, pesto & fresh basil. So so good. Very filling. 

Ultimate:
Nice big slices of pepperoni, mushrooms & onion. Very standard & Delish. 

Price was good. We can't comment on service as we got it to go but it was ready within 15/20 min as they promised on the phone. :)"}
{"text":"Stopped by here for the first time. It was a Sunday afternoon at the tail end of the lunch crowd. We decided to eat in. It's very casual - menu is hand written on a large wall. I did the 1/2 pizza &1/2 salad - hubby did a full salad and added chicken. We got a number and easily found a table to sit down. Their iced tea was Mighty Leaf which I dad not seen at a restaurant before. The green tea was yummy.

Took maybe 10 mins for food. Everything looked beautiful and well made with fresh ingredients. I LOVED my spinach salad with bacon-egg-mushrooms! The mix of flavors was awesome and the best salad I have had in quite some time. I also had the fig - prosciutto pizza which was delicious. I am a pizza junky and looking forward to trying a classic pie with red sauce next time. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Not a fast food chain, so already off to an excellent start. Food was good, fresh, and portions were reasonable. Kids pizza meal was good and came with a side, a drink, and a cookie. The Gobbler sandwich was great. Bread was excellent and quinoa salad was nice. Friendly staff and the restaurant was very clean and uncluttered. We will return."}
{"text":"We had the Baller Pizza and the Italian Sandwich. Both were fantastic. I loved the bread on the sandwich. Shane told us that it is made fresh daily. The food came out quick and was HOT! This place has great atmosphere and it is the perfect addition to our neighborhood. Welcome Local Eats!"}
{"text":"Great food for the price.  I originally thought it was Low Cal eats, but no, it's Local Eats - the sign is a little misleading.   They serve unique pizzas that other restaurants would call some kind of premium flatbread creation and charge an arm and a leg for.   You'll find very trendy combo's - maybe a goat cheese fig pizza with a glass of wine - very nice.
I provide 5 stars because of the excellent value, combined with the modern flavor combinations."}
{"text":"My family and I are very excited to have this amazing place so close. This area has needed a fresh, non-chain locally grown restaurant to compete against the bar and grills and fast food. 

The sandwiches are amazing! The salads are big and full of fresh ingredients. The pizzas are unique and come in a size that's perfect for two."}
{"text":"Very good pizza. Clean place. Can order from their custom pizza selections or build your own. We chose to build our own. We didn't try the salads or other food options, but saw others having them and they looked good. Will try more than just the tasty pizza on next visit."}
{"text":"We just found this place a few weeks ago. We original ordered a pizza for carry out. It was really good. We dined in the next time and well, we have been back twice this week. We have had three different kinds of sandwiches. The Pig Press, Chicken Pesto and the Gobbler. They are amazing. I tried soup and salad today and I am very impressed. I also love that service and the atmosphere. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Yummy pizza and salad! Cute ambience, would definitely go back! I hope They stick around, not many good places out here."}
{"text":"We love Local Eats for so many reasons. First, it's local, next it's the food, then of course, the amazing staff. 

Briana is super personable and outgoing at the counter, she's cheery and delightful. My younger kids love sitting at the counter where Dustin and Alec are more than happy to show off their pizza making skills and engage with the kids every time we come in. 

The fig and prosciutto Pizza is sick, In fact, we've never had a bad meal here. I highly recommend you go through the menu and try everything."}
{"text":"Pizza is good but the real stars are the sandwiches. A few beers on tap and decent pricing. Just happy to see somewhere to eat in this area that isn't a franchise. Clean and modern design inside. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Clean, healthy, and nice. Love the quinoa salad, don't knock it till you try it, sounds crazy but... It's delicious. Great place for a satisfying lunch."}
{"text":"My daughter ordered the Field Greens salad, looked pretty good except for the 2 long blonde hairs in it.  Told the wait staff but no one offered any replacement or money back.  Pretty disappointed."}
{"text":"My favorite place! I'm a picky New Yorker and this has been the best pizza I found since moving here."}
{"text":"So delicious!!  Don't miss out on the pressed pig sandwich, AMAZING!  Great customer service."}
{"text":"We love this place!  Definately the best place in the area.  Good, consistent food and decent prices."}
{"text":"Pretty good place. Have been here twice and have not been disappointed. I had their pressed pig and foreggy salad combo. It was a fair price."}
{"text":"Thanks to all the Yelpers who submitted reviews! We tried Field salad and Carnivore pizza. YUM! Both my husband and I loved it."}
{"text":"Very good and really fresh. Get the pizza and salad combo and share with another person to try theirs. You'll be stuffed."}
{"text":"I live in the area and was introduced to this place by some friends. We came for dinner and had the local chop salad and tried several different pizzas. My husband and I loved the food and will definitely be making this our weekly Friday night spot. It doesn't look like much from the outside but is much more on the inside!"}
{"text":"Love that this place is close to home and fresh. And we love supporting small local businesses!  All of the food we've had here has been good...nothing mind-blowing but good and for the price it holds its own. We frequent Blue 32 all the time which is located right by a Local Eats and is actually owned by the same family. I give Blue 32 a 5+ star rating any day and everyday. The reason I can't here is because the service is ALWAYS lacking. It's like a night and day difference from what we always see at Blue 32. We go often when we just don't have the time to sit and actually \"rest\"aurant, but are running around and need to grab something hot and fresh and get on to where we need to go with the kids or whatever the case may be. The gals at the front always seem to have ZERO personality and make one feel as though you are ruining their day just by walking in the establishment doors. Then, God forbid you need something after placing your order at the front...and keep in mind the gals won't ask you either when they drop off your food...as in literally just drop it off...no eye contact...no expression and no asking if you need anything or have everything for that matter. I've had better service when I've gone to Wendy's and they've had to drop off our food!  When I went up to the counter to ask super politely for some Parmesan for our pies, there was no verbal response just a shrug from the gal behind the counter as she reached from some and put it where I could reach it...never making eye contact or saying anything even responding to my thank you when I retrieved it. Keep in mind some variation of this experience happens EVERY time we go there. And yes, we've continued going because it's close, easy, the food is fresh and at this point I guess we just know what to expect, but I figured after today and noticing EVERYONE in there was sharing in this same experience, I just thought it was time to pass this along. I know it's hard to find good help these days, but I hope things change up here for Local Eats soon! They've got it going on in service and personality at Blue 32...maybe they need to give all the kiddos at Local Eats a little lesson. Hope things change up! I'd love to switch this to 5 stars...I know you all can make it happen! Cheers!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing I have not experienced a bad visit, food is always great it is hard to say which one is my favorite."}
{"text":"Ran across this gem a few days ago. Decent sized dining space with a cool interior design. Food was outstanding, price was fair, excellent beer on tap, great menu selection, clean dining area and bathrooms, friendly staff. Much needed spot for the area, will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great fig and prosciutto pizza! It had a sweet taste to it that I thought was honey but found out no honey was added. Field salad was tasty as well. I'm an iced tea fanatic and it was good as well. Sometimes it's made wrong and tastes bad, not the case here. Friendly staff and quick. Love this new gem."}
{"text":"We just tried this place for the first time, and we were really impressed. We got the pressed pig sandwich, margherita pizza, and prosciutto-fig pizza, and every bite was delicious. Service was minimal but friendly. Will definitely be returning soon."}
{"text":"Been here twice.  Salads are good, wish there were a couple more to choose from.  Sandwiches good as well, still wish there were a couple more.  But then again if you do something well why mess it up.  Love the pizzas.  And they have biodegradable cups(84.3% after 1154 days) if you're into that sort of thing."}
{"text":"The pizza is delicious with lots of gourmet options. They provide gluten free options & will custom make pizzas  to accommodate dairy free as well. The service is quick & courteous. I wish they had more salad  & salad dressing options. One of my favorite nearby pizza restaurants."}
{"text":"Pizza was good. Not great. Can have some fun at home making some ourselves. Salad average. Cesar was too watery, there fore lacked the punch."}
{"text":"I wish the guy at the register could have been more friendly and helpful. I ended up paying more than I wanted to because he really didn't explain anything. Also the boys making pizza with their dirty string bracelets on touching the food made it less appetizing. The food however is good."}
{"text":"Great place close to home. Cute decor and lots of options. My son is 1 and loves just about anything that we've ordered from here. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Best kept secret in Gilbert. Forget all the pizza chains, this place is worth the drive.  Always consistently fresh salads and pizza."}
{"text":"A little pricey but good quality and tasty food.  They have messed up on my order a few times but were always quick to fix it without hassle. The Italian sandwich is delicious and I love their balsamic vinegar. Both the tomato soup and broccoli soup are very good as well. The caprese sandwich is also very delicious but beware if your taking it togo the bread can get a little soggy pretty quick so eat it there if you can."}
{"text":"Pretty simple menu.  Pizza , sandwiches or salads but the food is good.  Pizza had the perfect crust.  Wedge salad tastes very good and the kids pizza had a thumbs up.

Local place, quick and easy service and will come back for sure."}
{"text":"Pros: very fresh, pizza crust is thin and crispy. I've tried a few and it's consistent. Sandwiches are also great, they make the bread fresh there every day. The field salad is my favorite portions are great. Clean and great service. 

Cons: if you order a sandwich to go, bread goes soggy very fast. I work just next door, and it doesn't hold up well. I wish they go the option to order a just a half sandwich or salad. Sometimes when you walk in it is warm stuffy. 

Over all I do really like it here :)"}
{"text":"Took way too long just to get a sandwich.   Food was cold.  Will never go back.  Staff at this place were not very nice or polite."}
{"text":"Checked it out after looking on Yelp, the reviews are spot on food is fantastic! Staff friendly and service is great. Brought my kids there and they enjoyed it as well."}
{"text":"I love it here and its very clean  nice and very good  food to eat ask for  Shane or Seth there very nlce."}
{"text":"Based on all the positive reviews posted I was anxious to try Local Eats,. I arrived about 5:15 and I was the only customer there. I ordered an extra large Margherita  and a small  Fig & Prosciutto for takeout. After the pies were put in the oven they realized that they reversed the order.  O.k., I was able to live with that. The Margherita was the worst ever, over cooked and the cheese was like glue and could not be tasted, the crust was like cardboard  The Fig & Prosciutto toppings were very tasty but again the crust was awful.  We are New Yorkers and my husband is from Italy and we do know how a great pizza should be.  Unfortunately Local Eats misses the mark.  They have a big investment in this restaurant and I truly hope that they can  shape up and master the art of pizza making and be successful at this location."}
{"text":"First time here (just moved around here) and WOW.... I was looking for some good, unique food around here. We are filled with all these huge chains.
This place exceeded my expectations.

Chicken pesto sandwich is a MUST! I did a sandwich combo with the local chop salad. Delicious! I'm super picky and weird when it comes to meat at food places, but this chicken was delicious. So flavorful and tender. And it paired nicely with the artichoke and pesto! And the bread makes the whole thing even better.

The local chop salad was phenomenal. Very flavorful and the salad dressing is so different and flavorful. 

Definitely try this place!"}
{"text":"Cool little place to get a bite...decor is nice and they have all kinds of pizza and sandwiches.  Prices were about the norm.  I had a pizza and it's made and cooked right in front of you which is kinda neat.   Sandwiches are a must to try...any of them.  Great place to bring the family."}
{"text":"This is becoming one of our favorite spots.  Local fresh and delicious food.  Much to choose from on the menu and everything we have gotten to date has been really good"}
{"text":"My family had eaten here at least ten times now and we enjoy the food. The portion are about right size, food is prepared when you order it, and flavors are good. Here is why it will never truly get the success it deserves, The service stinks. Last time we dined in the 20 year old guy who brings your food to the table just kept walking up to every table asking if the food he was carrying was yours. They give you a number when you order which you place the stand at your table, so the idea that he can't remember which table it goes to 30 seconds later baffles me! They also stand around for a minute or two when everything is complete rather than having the urgency to get the food right to you. Two weeks ago we ordered a pizza and a salad TO GO from the young lady at the counter ! The restaurant was empty. When they finished making the order the same young lady put the pizza in one of those red pizza holders to keep warm. We are literally the only people in the place. We waiting figuring that order that looks like ours must be a phone order. Excepted no one in the restaurant was doing any cooking. In about 5 minutes I walked up to same young lady and asked if the order in the warmer was ours and she asked for my name, and said yes. She literally did not recognize me and did not remember we did the order in person and sat at the table closest to the counter. I literally could have sat there for an hour and nobody would have asked me a thing while my food sat in a warmer. Hire some new staff, somebody that can lead your team. Restaurants are too easy to fail and with kids like that running your building you will be done soon enough."}
{"text":"Since I work in the area a lot,  iv eaten at ALL the food spots for lunch. This is A much needed yummy lunch spot. 
Love their pepperoni pizza!

Not sure what else to say, but yelp says I need more words.  Interesting...

So yes it's a 5 star lunch spot for me."}
{"text":"My brother and I picked up a few pizzas to go for lunch yesterday and we're 100% floored with out wonderful they were! 

First the restaurant is really fresh and clean inside with great decor and looks like a fun place to come and actually sit down to eat at. Plus when we placed our orders to go the cashier offered us cups for water while we waited, which I thought was great customer service. 

Second we didn't come at a busy time so our pizzas only took about 10 mins to make, and they brought them right out to us piping hot! 

Lastly the pizza itself was so good. I got the herbivore for my wife and I to share, and oh my god was it good, the mushrooms they put on it were so buttery and delicious with the perfect amount of seasoning, I could have eaten a whole pizza just with those mushrooms! My brother got the Baller and it was pretty good as well, not my personal favorite but the meatballs were good, and the ricotta was so creamy! 

Love that this spot is right around the corner from our house and we will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Out-of-Towner here. Was seeking a lunch bite, my 16 year old son and father-in-law settled on the McDonald's cuisine, from which I have long since graduated. Not much in the area, I wandered over to this place not knowing anything about the joint. I'd call it your average strip mall layout newish eatery. I'm perfectly cool w/the order at the counter & wait for your food concept & it works here. 

I ordered your basic red sauce w/a couple of meats/mushroom pizza. Came out quickly & I wandered back over to McD's to eat w/my family suffering from the ability to choke down that food. When I got there, my pizza was hot, cheese melted and great crust thickness (i.e. not very thick) &   consistency. 

I do prefer a bit more sauce and this wasn't earth shattering flavored pizza. But the service was good & friendly, I ordered quickly to get back to my party (so I could've pry chose better) and as I said, it came out quick. I would return should I end up in this neck of the woods again."}
{"text":"I was picking up what they were laying down.Everything was fresh and the way they mixed flavors on the pizzas was something entirely new and different. The dining are was cute and very clean. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been going to Local Eats for the past few months and always have had great meals.  The kids usually have mac and cheese or meatballs or a kids pizza with spinach.   The wife and I usually split a pizza and balsamic wedge salad.

The food (especially the salads) is always fresh and tasty.  Pizza toppings are numerous with Fig and prosciutto,  chicken pesto and the \"Baller\" being tops on our list.

Service is friendly and efficient.   You can view the staff making pizza or watch sports on the large screen tv from the comfortable dining area.

Local Eats is a keeper for this family!"}
{"text":"I ordered the caprese sandwich and field salad with the dressing on the side. They offered a combo special and it is delicious! The sandwich was great good thick slices of tomato and mozzarella, mmhmmm my fave. And the dressing on the field salad is great! I would go buy a jar of that stuff. I wonder if they make it in house. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite for lunches because it too closed to my house that I can pick up my lunch in a minute a drive from my place. I liked foods here o lots because when I am not cooking my lunches and here is my place for my lunches! The foods were good and the discount alright that I don't mind come back here often for the foods I liked! I truly recommended!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place several times and picked up lunch, the food is consistently really good. The place is in a strip mall and from the outside you would not believe how nice it is inside, modern with like a rustic vibe. I generally get one of the sandwiches and a salad and really enjoy them, my favorite is the Pesto chicken it is on there house made ciabatta bread, it is a large sandwich so I usually get the combo half sandwich and salad, the salad I enjoy is the local chop it has the Italian meats, olives, red onions, has a kick with the pepperoncini in it and  comes with a creamy garlic parmesan dressing served on the side. I want to try one of there pizzas the next time I am there, they have quite a variety."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE.  The pizza is wonderful and the ingredients taste so fresh.  Love the bread for the sandwiches which my husband and I share because they are so big.  We haven't tried the salads because we can't get beyond the sandwich and pizza menu.  We have only done take out so I can't comment on the service.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Chicken Pesto sandwich was great, broccoli Cheddar soup was very tasty. Pizza was this thin crusted and had good flavor."}
{"text":"Local Eats ALWAYS delivers fresh and tasty food. Forager salad - amazing. all of the pizzas too!"}
{"text":"Had the Fig pizza and the Forager salad, both were fantastic! Great place from the creators of Blue 32!!"}
{"text":"I visited this place with my coworkers, we were there for a lunch meeting. The shop is small but they managed to create lots of seating. Good menu combos, I enjoyed that a lot. The price was on the high side for many things but it seems all true local eats. So I'm happy we supported small business and local ones."}
{"text":"We had an urge for some pizza and this was our first choice.  I got the combo pizza and salad.  Baller and local chop.  Both solid choices.  I've had both of them before and really enjoy them.  This time though, the pizza was not that good.  Compared to the last time, the crust was mediocre.  It was soft in the center and required an extra hand to keep it from dumping everything off of it when you attempted to bite it.  Surprisingly though, the bottom of 1/2 the pizza was burned.  Burned to the point that I was greeted by the lingering taste of soot after swallowing each bite.  Pretty unappetizing to say the least.  Haven't had that experience the last two times we were there.  The pizza crust was a perfect combination of crispy and chewy and you could easily pick up each piece with one hand.  We'll be back again I'm sure, but I'm going to keep an eye on the crust!"}
{"text":"The people were friendly and patient for our first visit. We chose two pizzas and one sandwich and everything was so delicious! The fig and prosciutto pizza was my favorite one, the sweetness of the fig and the saltiness of the prosciutto went so well with each other and was just such a good meal! It was also very convenient they had their to go boxes laid out next to the drinks, with all their sauces and red peppers!"}
{"text":"Love this place. I ordered the Smokehouse pie and my husband ordered the pressed pig sandwich and tomato basil soup. We will be back. I also ordered the chop salad. Everything was fresh and delicious. Quick & friendly service."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 4 stars so the rating stays high on Yelp, but the service needs some serious attention. The manager seemed to be all over the place (or at least a guy that looked like the manager) and doing everything, while the guy at the front kind of putzed around with a zoned out look on his face. We never did get a smile from him. And we waited a good 10 minutes for our beers (guessing he wasn't 21 so he couldn't pour them and had to wait for the manager that was doing everything else to get them). Overall the food was good. It's a great little family restaurant or a casual dinner out spot. I love that they had a gluten free pizza dough! We will definitely be back here to give them another shot!"}
{"text":"Great pizzas, caprese  and Italian sandwiches. Ice cold IPA beer. Friendly staff. We will be back."}
{"text":"We love this place! This is probably the best pizza I've had since moving here, we ordered the pesto chicken pizza. Fresh ingredients and very good mozzarella!"}
{"text":"There food is amazing! I especially love their pizza. It's super crunchy (which I love), and is crisp and delicious. The people there are super nice and it's right by my house. Definitely a go-to dinner place for my family!"}
{"text":"I was super excited when I saw a new restaurant  was opening in my desperate-for-dining-options neighborhood of Seville. I was less than thrilled to see that it was yet another casual, un-unique (is that a word?) establishment. I mean, do we really need another pizza & salad option around here? What my friends and I are really dying for is a  something a little more fancy, like a wine bar. But I digress, of course with limited options and our fondness for Blue 32, my family gave this a shot tonight. 

What I like: 
- family-friendly. Every table had kids, yet I noticed there were no crayons or any extras to entertain your kids. Nice kid meal for $5. 
- The pizza and salad were great! They had a couple options that were more creative  than what you may get at big sister Blue32. Like the \"Baller\" we had tonight with pesto, sausage and ricotta. 


What was lacking:
- Service. I get it, they just opened, but 1 salad, 1 pizza and a kids pizza took over 35 minutes. Waaay too long when you're with a 2 year old. 
- Lunch prices. I work out near Local Eats and notice it's dead for lunch. I think this is because it's expensive for a lunch crowd. I had hoped to be able to pick up a lunch-portion salad or sandwich to go, but I'm not paying over $10 for lunch. 
- Creativity. They are new, but I hope to see some changes in the menu so we don't get bored going there. There were 2-3 non-standard pizza's or sandwiches on the menu, one with an egg and chipotle sauce one with fig & prosciutto , etc., but other than that it's your standard, wedge, Caesar, pepperoni pizza and the like. 

Good potential for what it is. I'm thankful for another dining option."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches! Pizza is very tasty, but wish they were more generous with ingredients. This is a regular stop for us."}
{"text":"We've been here at least 10 times, mostly take-out. Really excellent pizza and sandwiches. Crust and sauce are both great. Salads are very good also. Prosciutto and goat cheese pizza is my favorite, with the turkey sandwich my favorite sandwich. Manager is very good. Occasionally some of the younger/ newer employees have messed up orders and struggle with the register, but the manager will quickly fix orders. Very good quality and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Pizza is absolutely amazing. The crust is what makes it perfect. It's soft and doughy yet a little crispy and charred on the outside from the fire when they cook it. I've only had take out so I am not sure on the service while being waited on. But, I will let you know next time when I do! 
It's also near the Blue32 which is also my favorite!"}
{"text":"If we could give them a 3.5 we would, but we don't feel like it deserves a 4. 

The pizza is good, not great like Fired Pie. We ordered fresh mozzarella and felt it was pretty skimpy. 

Pampered Pig and tomato soup combo was again good but not memorable. 

Caesar salad was fresh but the dressing was plain. Definitely would not order again. 

Service was kind of funny. The server may have been new - she answered questions inaccurately (We asked what desert options there were and she said there were no deserts while we watched someone else eating a cookie. She said nothing is organic while I'm drinking their organic tea etc). 

To sum it up, if I was hungry and in the area I wouldn't be opposed to eating here but won't seek it out."}
{"text":"Really like the pizza here, the crust has a light char and chew to it. I have only had take out, but my husband says it's a busy place and it's loud on a Friday night when I place an order.  Our favorite pizza is the meatball and ricotta aka Baller, I know it sounds weird but it's delicious. We have also had the Smokehouse and Pesto Chicken which both had an excellent flavor but dry, the pepperoni which was ok, and the Margarita which was also a tad dry.  This pizza doesn't taste that good cold and we haven't had luck with reheating, but it's great hot and fresh. When we order again I will ask for lots of extra sauce. The salads are pretty good, and seem fresh."}
{"text":"OK, this place is pretty legit.. the one reason it doesn't get 4 stars is the kid in a semi zombie state of incoherence at the register. Good thing his manager made up for (insert name of kid who gave zero fucks about his job). 

Pizza, on point.
Salad, the wedge is great.
Cold beer, check.
close to home, check"}
{"text":"Have tried the carnivore, pepperoni, and tonight will try the Italian sub.  It was amazing.  You will not be disappointed !"}
{"text":"Great place for a sandwich or salad and their pizza is fantastic my wife and I went for lunch we love it prices right food is very good Brad is doing an awesome job"}
{"text":"This place is great! Their pizzas are amazing and the salads are fresh and delicious. The meatball sandwich is wonderful and you can't go wrong with any of the salads or pizzas. The service is great and the employees are extremely friendly!"}
{"text":"To start off, I read the yelp reviews before coming here and was excited because all of the reviews seemed decent. I ordered a margherita pizza and a field salad combo online. Sadly I was not impressed with the pizza, it was very plain and didn't have much flavor to it. I would not recommend the margherita pizza."}
{"text":"Wow very surprised. Super nice inside, nice staff, and very very clean. Prices seemed reasonable for the quality of food. I eat lots of pizza, like 3 times a week lots and this place was really good. I will be back for sure. If you like wood fired style pizza you will like this place, it's the best in the area by a long shot."}
{"text":"We liked the food a lot! I got the pressed pig which was delicious, and my mom got the Italian. She loved it and I tasted it...I'm getting that next time, yum. I will try the pizza in a future visit too. The service could be better; it's very slow and the kids aren't hustling AT ALL. There were only a few customers but it took close to 20 minutes for just the two sandwiches. Hopefully it will be quicker next time."}
{"text":"This place is a GEM!!! Ordered for the first time today and just got done eating and the Pesto Chicken Pizza was the BOMB!!!"}
{"text":"Just went in with some friends for lunch. We got the prosciutto fig pie, margherita pizza, and pressed pig sandwich. Everything was delicious and exceeded our expectations. 10/10!"}
{"text":"The prosciutto fig pizza was very lovely! It was a little sweet but I really liked it. We also got some salads and the pesto chicken pizza. The salads weren't amazing, but we were there for the pizza so no big deal."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and it just gets better and better!!     My first visit I had a margherita pizza and it was very flavorful and crust was amazing.  

This last visit I had the pleasure of ordering the caprese sandwich.    Omg!!     Wowza was it perfect.    In my head I was thinking it would be like any old sandwich I've had over the years that has a hard crusty bread.    So happy that I was pleasantly surprised with the softest, perfect bread!    The mozzarella cheese was fresh, soft, creamy.     It was a compliment to the rich tomatoes, the pesto sauce and the balsamic glaze.       Everything was just exactly exquisite!     Not sure I'm going to be willing to try anything new when I go back because I loved that caprese sandwich so much!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch yesterday with my Grand daughter & the food was fabulous! I love going there for lunch and their soups are delicious!"}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite places that a visited at least once a week... until tonight... this was the Pepperoni Pizza I received... And the service was of the same quality. Hopefully for everyone else, this was just an off night. I'll have to find a new favorite spot"}
{"text":"The service we got was TERRIBLE!!!.  We ordered our meal and drinks then 15 mins later had to ask for our drinks, then when they brought our meal it was all wrong. They brought 1 kids meal to the table when we had order 3. They brought 1 sandwich at a time over a 20 min period. Most of which were wrong and had to be sent back. 2 of my kids were screaming because 1 kid had lunch and the others did not, which added to my frustration. My sandwich was the last to arrive and when it did it was wrong and without the soup I had ordered. I asked for another round of drinks while we waited for our right sandwiches, we watched the server pour them and then walk away to the back of store and our drinks sat on the counter for another 10 mins until we again had to ask for them. Then after returning home we realized we had been charged 2x for our lunch. We placed 2 calls to the restaurant to fix the chargers and we told the manager wasn't in until the next day and WE would have to call AGAIN tomorrow after 4pm. Over all incredibly disappointed! I wish the restaurant the best but I WILL NOT be returning! And I have yet to be reimbursed for the 45$ extra charge :("}
{"text":"This little gem of a place is hiding in a strip mall but worth seeking out.  Food is so tasty and fresh!  The staff is delightful and the environment is down to earth and relaxed.  They are only open for lunch and I wish they would expand to breakfast and/or dinner.  So good!"}
{"text":"Stumbled across this gem last week, and I think it will be our new Friday night dinner spot.  The pizza is delicious and they've got cold beer on tap sold by the pitcher or the pint. Tonight we had the chopped salad, the ultimate pizza and split a pitcher of hop knot IPA and got out of their for $30. Great value, great food. 5s"}
{"text":"Randomly stop here for a quick bite. Omfg!!! In my top 5 best sandwiches ever. I'll have to come back frequently to make sure it wasn't a fluke. Bread, meat, cheese and everything else was on point!"}
{"text":"Not the greatest.... Pizzas were bland due to very little sauce. Thought we would give it a try since it's local and not a chain however, there is no flavor to this pizza.  Super disappointing . Management was willing to remake however remaking it won't help the flavor. Maybe a little salt in the dough will help?"}
{"text":"Gave Local Eats a try on their opening day; well almost opening day...they have been open for about a week for dinner with the same menu but this was the first day they were open for lunch as well.  Located in the same strip mall as their sister restaurant Blue 32, this is a much smaller and cuter spot that seems to be more aimed at a lunch crowd.  The decor is pleasing with a bit if a shabby chic theme and the restaurant is set up with an order counter at the front and food will be delivered to you when it is ready.  I was surprised that it wasn't crowded but I am not sure how much advertising they have done to announce that they are now open.

Staff is friendly although I can tell that they are still learning.  The menu is a really great one for lunch or a light dinner.  From pizzas made to order, fresh sandwiches and salads, this menu is sure to please all tastes.  From what I understand, they are willing to even customize most things as well for the pickier eater. I chose the Mozzarella caprese sandwich.  It was served on a ciabatta roll and had lots of flavor including pesto and balsamic.  The only complaint I had was that the ciabatta was very soft, almost soggy.  I would have liked a little more crispness of the roll.  my friends ordered salads and they were very hearty and fresh and they enjoyed them.

I am really excited that this place has opened so close to home. It is also good for take out so I will definitely give that a try as well."}
{"text":"Everything is fresh/scratch made and delicious. Try the meatball sandwich on home-made ciabatta bread. Simply devine."}
{"text":"We have liked everything we have tried, including several pizzas, salads and sandwiches.  I recommend this unique, local spot."}
{"text":"This place rocks.  We've lived in Seville for 8 years waiting for some non-chain restaurants to open in this area and these guys capitalized.  The pizza is similar to grimaldis with like a LGO personal sized twist to it.  Now I'm mentioning both those places, but  I actually think local eats pizza is better than grimaldis and I'd say equal to LGO.   Everything is super fresh.   I got the ultimate, my wife got the 4 cheese, and we got my son a kids pizza (which came with a cookie and drink!).  The crust is great, not too thin, and the sauce is the perfect flavor with not too much garlic and doesn't taste like it's from the bottle.  The kids pizza is the perfect size. It's about half the pizza.  My son almost ate all of it which let me tell you is impressive since he usually eats 3 bites of pizza.   The decor is really cool. It has like a modern feel to it.  Very kid friendly.  Prices are fair for what you get.  I wouldn't do date night here, but this works for anything else.   I've been told some dessert options are coming soon so I'm excited to see what oven fired deliciousness they invent. Now if they had dessert and I liked it I would give this a 5 so I'll be back to update my review."}
{"text":"Neighborhood owned unique themed restaurant.  First time dining here with my daughter.  We were greeted by a nice young lady who took our order at the counter and we decided to sit bar side to watch them make the pizzas.  It was kind of cool since they have some unique toppings. 
We a Caesar salad, a pepperoni pizza with ricotta cheese and a plain cheese pizza. It was cool to be so close to the oven and see the pizza bubble. 
It was good, the salad was excellent with spicy croutons, phenomenal taste. 
I would give more stars, but feel like the pizzas were stingy on toppings. I think there were 4 dabs of ricotta and not enough pepperonis. My daughter also felt there wasn't enough cheese on the pizza. I'm a stickler for cleanliness,  especially where I eat, and the cool light bulbs above our heads need dusting.  
Will come back as is locally owned, in my neighborhood,  the serve beer and wine and the Caesar salad was great! !!"}
{"text":"The food was so bland.  The service was distant and gave off a vibe that they were just put off having to help you or take your order. We got the meatball sandwich and it is best described as a greasy hotdog cut up and served on a burnt English muffin."}
{"text":"Great local restaurant! We all got the pizza & salad combo and they were all amazing. Wedge salad was perfect & the stone fired pizza crust rocks! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Support this place because it's one of the good ones. The aesthetics are awesome. Cool, hip vibe with great service. Our group had pizza, salads and sandwiches and everyone loved their food. Great food combinations. Give them a try."}
{"text":"I love this little gem! My favorite is the chicken pesto sandwhich yum. The pizzas are always perfect and if you order to pick up the wait time is never longer then 20 min which is great. Super cute on the inside too."}
{"text":"An honest attempt to be a sustainable restaurant.  The ingredients are very fresh and tasty.  The pizza is just as good as most \"brick oven\" pizza restaurants.  I would give 5-Stars but it is a bit pricey and the chicken pesto sandwich could use more pesto.  Overall, very good."}
{"text":"Making this place an every week thing! Casual but high quality is what we need in this neighborhood, thank you to the owners of Blue 32 for opening up this gem. 

Highly recommend the Italian sandwich and the Chicken Artichoke! The bread is AH-MAZING... They even get the cut sides all nice in crispy. The pizzas are delicious, especially because you're able to get a smaller portion for lunch. 

Can't wait to try more!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and bought two salads. We both were not impressed for the price of the salads. The croutons tasted stale and the pepperoncini tasted like they were not fresh quality. The only great part of the salad was the dressings. Maybe the pizza is the thing to get here. 

Won't rush back to try this place again."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice now. First time we ordered pizza and soup and sandwich. Second time I ordered soup and sandwich. Service is super slow here! Plan on waiting awhile for your food."}
{"text":"Pretty solid pizza, salad, and sandwich place. I got the lunch special. Half an ultimate pizza with a Caesar salad. Loved the spicy croutons on the salad. Lettuce was crisp and there was just the right amount of dressing. Pizza was great. Nice char on the crust and toppings tasted fresh. Loved the decor on the walls. The vintage wood is a nice touch. 

My only complaint is that there was a ton of noise in this place. Having a conversation was tough."}
{"text":"Inside is beautiful, the food is wonderful, and the people are awesome. Gilbert has some really good places to eat! Pizza was delicious and their sandwiches are too!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars I would!! I asked for NO ARTICHOKE ON MY SANDWICH!!!!! And they put it on anyway!!!! Don't eat here they will mess up your order!!! When I ask for no artichoke I expect there not to be artichoke on my freaking sandwich!! Also..... where my pizza?!?! Did they think I wouldn't miss my pizza that I paid for?!? Yeh um nooo....... they are really forgetful because they thought I wouldn't miss my drink!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are obsessed with this place. Cute atmosphere. Amazing food. Kid friendly. Great pricing. Just overall an excellent little Gem in Gilbert."}
{"text":"Amazing food! I've been here twice. Prosciutto and Fig Pizza and Pesto Chicken Sandwich are to die for!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food, great atmosphere, friendly service. Went there for the first time tonight, but I'll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Different take on sandwiches but very good. Only 6 sandwiches on the menu but lots of pizza choices.
Staff is friendly & place is clean"}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious! Called in a takeout order, and although I didn't chat with the lady at the counter for too long, she was nice!

Ambiance: 4.5/5. Seemed like a super clean, organized restaurant. The place was well ventilated with lots of light. It's kind of small, but that won't stop me from their pizza. Nothing will get in my way of the fig prosciutto pizza! 

Food: 4.5/5. Order the fig prosciutto pizza. Just do it. And maybe ask them to crisp up the prosciutto a bit more. All pizza I've tried from there is wonderful."}
{"text":"We found this place on yelp, decided to go for a lil drive and check this place out. I'm glad we did. Place is cute, staff is helpful and friendly.  I ordered a Hawaii and my fiancée ordered a Baller Pizza, both were excellent.  Definitely taking the drive to come back"}
{"text":"First time in. I was very pleased with the quick service and great tasting food! I didn't half salad and half sandwich combo. Extremely tasty Gobbler sandwich. Loved the mustard aioli. Will come back and get that sandwich again.  Caesar salad wasn't the best but still good flavor. Would get full sandwich only next time. The bread is awesome and the crust on the pizza was great! Definitely get a pizza or sandwich to try their bread! Sad thing is there ain't no dessert... what's up with that? Sell some cookies or something at least! Hope to see a dessert choice next time I come in for a Gobbler!"}
{"text":"The food is awesome here!!  I'm mean the flavor will literally slap you in your freakin' facehole!  I noticed they also have affordable beer & wine.  The dining area is a little lacking, which is why I give this only four stars. Otherwise, top notch place from the same owners of Blue 32.  

Order the Pesto Chicken sandwich if you want the flavor smack down mentioned earlier."}
{"text":"The food was so delicious!! Super fresh, softest bread ever and really great service! I had the lunch special with the fig and prosciutto pizza and field salad... Cleaned my plate!"}
{"text":"Very yummy food! I have had two different salads both that were yummy and had the same sandwiches both time I've been in. My ONLY complaint is my sandwich, the second time I was in, had jalapeños on it, and that isn't something that's on the list of ingredients on the menu. I picked them off, so not that big of a deal. I want to try their pizza, they also look yummy, and I have heard that they are delicious as well. Of course I will be back!!"}
{"text":"I had the red rooster and my wife had the herbivore, both were great. Prices were great and the food came out fast. Kids enjoyed the kids meal. It is a fast casual so you you are not going to get table service but it is well worth a visit for a quick pizza or salad fix."}
{"text":"Decided to come here with some friends last night. It's a nice small place. We all order something different however we couldn't get enough of the Fig  prosciutto pizza, it's seriously insane! We also had the red rooster- it was also good but super spicy! The Balsamic sand which was super good the cheese was refreshing. Will definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"A Gem tucked away on Higley. Bright atmosphere and people. Good fresh food. Great value. I had the meatball sandwich on ciabatta and local chop salad. Very good. Great people. A must try. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Easy enough to just say it's an order by menu only, Mod Pizza but a little more expensive. The problem is service is much slower. Cute place but loud. Food's not quite as good either. Maybe the sandwiches are? Probably won't be back to try."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place! Everything is made from scratch and locally resourced!  I had the Caprese sandwich and asked to have chicken added. The balsamic and the pesto sauces together made for a messier than usual sandwich but it was worth a few extra napkins and a trip to the bathroom to clean up! The chicken breast was juicy, the tomato was think and sweet, the Ciabatta was crispy having been lightly toasted, the mozzarella was perfectly salty, and the fresh chopped basil brought it all together! My husband had the Italian sandwich and said that it was delicious as well, just not as wordy a review as mine."}
{"text":"We've dined here on several occasions since they opened and have had some great experiences.  My daughters both have their favorites - The Pressed Pig sandwich is fantastic and the kids Mac n cheese is a hit.  I enjoy the Wedge salad myself.  Tonight, however, left a bad taste in my mouth.  We arrived at the restaurant and were the ONLY customers there.  Placed our order for a Hawaiian pizza, kids Mac n cheese, and a quinoa side salad @ 5:01pm.  When our order finally came out at 5:35pm (after watching many take out orders come & go), the Mac and cheese was cold and we had to send it back and the pizza was nothing to write home about.  Needless to say, unimpressed tonight with the service and food quality, & totally bummed to write my first negative yelp review because of it."}
{"text":"We have a 14-month old so our first visit was at ~5:45 on a Sunday to avoid the typical Gilbert 6pm rush - which we didn't have to worry about because not enough people know about Local Eats yet!  I think they need to work on their signage to get drive-bys and those who don't want to wait for 45+ minutes at Blue 32.  Several parties did come in and get take out though.

I had the Caprese sandwich - best I've ever had.  Generous mozzarella and a perfectly thick tomato slice with excellent pesto, basil and balsamic vinaigrette.  Hubby had a carnivore pizza which I didn't taste, but he thought it was pretty good.  Baby had the kiddo pizza - I tasted and thought that it was a very good cheesy flavor.  We also got the apple slices for her - nicely thin and no skin.

It's not 5 stars due to the limited availability of wine/beer.  The only red offering was a pinot noir (which was fine) and there were only 2 craft beers in addition to Bud Light."}
{"text":"I just witnessed the most disgusting thing here.  I just signed on to Yelp to write this post.  The boy at the counter was gnawing on his thumb, touching his face and hair before taking my order.  He proceeded to make my Benedict pizza without washing his hands.  A lady with a dirty rag comes over to the pizza prep station and puts the dirty rag on the place where the dough lies.  Disgusting.  Someone should call the health officials on them.  Yes, they are KIDS running this place."}
{"text":"Yowza!  I LIKED this place.
So you stand in line to place your order and the menu is on the wall.  Hey now, listen, I'm a first timer here so gimme a few cuz the menu is long and it's not simple -as in average/bland/boring.
I went with the pizza and salad combination for something like $10.
Besides the delicious combinations they offered they also made their pizzas fresh.  Fresh!  As in starting with dough, not a cardboard like disk that Fired Pie uses.  
And their pizzas are not a mirror of their salads, or vice versa.  
I thought both pizza and salad were delicious.
I devoured my lunch.

The ambience was country industrial or something and carried nicely through the restaurant.
It's somewhat small and seemed to fill quickly, but I never noticed customers loitering for a table.  
The soda station seemed to be a small, congested area but that could've been due to the fact there was a large party sitting nearby.
And speaking of soda stations.  They actually have soda water in addition to plain water from the soda fountain.  Score!

I look forward to dining here again.
May have to meet my son there for lunch this week.  ;-D"}
{"text":"We love Local Eats!!! Best pizzas! The ambiance inside the restaurant is nice and welcoming. What I love also, is the fact that we can call to make our order, and pick it up in 15 minutes. Very polite staffs and good food is all we love."}
{"text":"Great food with a different flare.   Priced a little high but worth it.  Service was good and very friendly."}
{"text":"Good food. Build your own kind of place . Clean, staff was super nice. They have beer and soft drinks and a good Variety of ice tea."}
{"text":"The field salad was amazing! Can't wait to try another and the sandwiches! Very nice neighborhood restraint, the fresh baked bread smells so yummy."}
{"text":"Went here the first time today and it may be my last. I ordered the fields salad with no greens but add romaine instead. When it came out it was wrong-how could you mess that up? And when I tried to explain it to the waitress to get my salad made correctly-she was rude. When my salad finally came out-it was 95% lettuce with a couple of sliced onions and cherry tomatoes. Not worth the almost $9 it cost."}
{"text":"Came here for family dinner and was very pleased! I had the ultimate pizza and I really  liked it. Their crust is so good! I'd be happy with a simple cheese pizza with how good the crust was. Fire cooked to order! The rest of my family got sandwiches and salads and had only good things to say about them."}
{"text":"Great food. Had the pesto chicken sandwich. Very good. Great decor. Definetly be back."}
{"text":"P O P P I N ! Beautiful decor; wish I could just live in this restaurant actually. The subway tiles and farmhouse lights and the rustic vibe ughhhhh I'm bringing a sleeping bag here and living here!! 

But the food: so yum. My husband and I got one combo and shared it. Pepperoni pizza and chop salad! THEY BOTH WERE SO FREAKIN DELISHHHHH. Brick oven gooey cheesy thin yummy pizza and a slightly spicy huge flavorful salad! The salad had so many veggies and some crunchy croutons in it, sliced meat, all tossed together. Mannnnn. And it was perfect to split for us actually (but I could also very easily eat it by myself hahahah hmm). Then we also got a kids mac n cheese with apples (and a cookie) for our son. He was very pleased as well!

Service: nice, friendly people and quick hot food. One guy working there seemed kinda bored lol poor guy 

Overall, the food was delish, the service good, restaurant clean and stylish. Good for kids! Would be a cute date lunch place or a good place to have an interview or study sesh. Loved it. Will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised how great this little place was. I had a meatball sandwich and a wedge salad, great quality, fast service and the staff that was there was friendly and helpful. I would go back there in a minute. The pizza looked great too but the salad/sandwich combo was more than enough to fill anyone. Oh and the bread they used was fantastic! You can buy it to go."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The ciabatta bread is probably the best I have had.  The sandwiches and salads are just the bomb.  I can't wait to try the pizza."}
{"text":"We found it on Yelp when we were looking for lunch. Amazing food!!! Pizza is fresh and taste amazing. Salads are good too. I like that you can do half pizza & half salad as an option. 

I would recommend this place to everyone if you are in Gilbert.

Service is great and fast!"}
{"text":"Such a breath of fresh air! My fiancé and I have been waiting for something to open up on this corner, and local eats has hit what we needed and nailed it! 
The food and service is completely outstanding. Everyone here is so friendly and so eager to make your experience amazing! The food comes out quick and we haven't order anything we haven't liked! The bread and dough is made fresh everyday and you can taste it!!! The sandwiches are amazing , and the pizza is wildfire grilled!!! Plus they have beer and wine which is great while your waiting! To be honest I would even just go for a beer cause the service is so great!!!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this place! Love that it's locally owned, local products and Arizona beers. We enjoyed their pizzas. We ordered three and all were a great size and very flavorful. Nice atmosphere and staff. There are only two suggestions. 1-offer a half or side salad. The Caesar was really big and with two people we still had a ton left. Felt overpriced for what it was. 2-the kids menu offered meatballs, adding some pasta with it would have been good. However the kids pizza was a perfect portion.  Overall we enjoyed our experience and will return soon."}
{"text":"As a New Yorker, I'm picky about my pizza and I have to say this is the best I have had since moving here in 2009. The Salads are also outstanding! A favorite for our family!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The food is so fresh and full of flavor and the selection is rally simple but diverse. They serve a few beers on tap and have a great atmosphere. Come here and enjoy lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"My family and I have been going here for the past year and this is one of our favorite places to eat! The kids menu is great, plus has a healthy option of fresh cut apples as a side. They also give the kiddos a chocolate chip cookie with their meal which my son loves. For adults, their salads, sandwiches and pizza are just the best! They use fresh ingredients and i've honestly never had a bad meal here. My favorites are the BBQ Chicken pizza, their mac and cheese and their caesar salad! Love this place! The atmosphere is very cute and comfy - it has a nice restaurant feel even though you order and pay at the counter."}
{"text":"Love, love, love!! So nice to finally have a good restaurant in this area!! Ate here for the first time today and was very pleased!! I ordered a pizza half pepperoni half smokehouse bbq and it was absolutely delicious!! Love the atmosphere and decor.  Perfect place for lunch!! Will definitely be back to try the sandwiches and salads!!"}
{"text":"Very fresh large portions. The pizza crust is amazing. Staff is extremely friendly! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Just stopped in here for the first time and all I can say is YUM! The first thing on the menu that caught my eye was the Fig & Prosciutto pizza. It was amazing. They have a combo menu where you can do half and half, so I picked that and the field salad. Everything was fresh and tasted excellent. I will definitely be coming back here again :)"}
{"text":"definitely the best pizza i've had in this part of the valley, everything is always so fresh tasting. sandwiches and soups are always great and the salads are unique and delicious. never had a bad experience here"}
{"text":"Me and my friend's favorite place to eat. The local chop will change your life. 10/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"Food: we ordered the \"baller\" (sliced meatballs, ricotta, and basil) and the \"smokehouse\" (chicken, bbq sauce, mushrooms, and feta) with a \"forager\" salad (sliced egg, bacon, mushrooms, spinach, onion strings). The pizzas were delicious with the right mix of flavor and dressing on the salad was a perfect compliment. Sauces and crusts were great and cooked right. 

Drinks: they had a soda fountain, they offered flavored teas, four peaks beers and bottles of wine

Service: very friendly staff. Food was promptly served in around 10 min. 

Atmosphere: kind of a diner set up. Order as you walk in, sit at bar, tables, or half booths. One big screen tv. Like a modern rustic motif. 

We will definitely be coming back. 

I'm going to post up some pics too."}
{"text":"Out for a ride and it was time to eat and get out of the heat. Ask a lady in the parking lot how the food was and she replied, \"yum\". Friendly service good food. I had a Caprese. It hit the spot. If out riding your bike this way it's a great pitstop. Get all your services taken care of."}
{"text":"Light and airy crust on the pizza is amazing. Lots to chose from. Kids are happy with Pepperoni and mommy is happy with some far more adventurous choices.   Simply delicious."}
{"text":"This place has really good pizza and everything we got tasted great, however, the salads are way overpriced for what you get. I would have expected to pay $3 maybe $4 at the most for my salad that was over $8 because you basically get a bowl of lettuce and dressing with hardly any of the toppings that help fill you up. There were a few people in our party that ordered salads for their meal and it was the same with each salad that came to our table. Other than that it was a good experience."}
{"text":"Came in because I have recently moved to Gilbert and the food near me is just ok. Luckily, I found this place and will definitely throw them in the rotation. 

Had a meatball sandwich that was toasted and overall excellent. Looking forward to trying the pizza as well!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine had been to this place and raved about the sandwiches.  So we went last week and both had the turkey sandwich on Ciabatta bread, which was freshly baked in the restaurant.  It was the most delicious sandwich and very large.  I should have taken half home, but it was so good I couldn't stop eating.  By the looks of the menu on wall, they have pizza, soup, salads and sandwiches...I am anxious to try more things."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time after checking out reviews and pics. Went with an Italian and chopped salad combo. The salad was good. I was so hungry I didn't look at the ingredients as I am not a fan of olives and banana peppers. The true star on my plate was the Italian sandwich. It was sooo good! The bread was very fresh and delicious too. Highly recommend the sandwich! Next time I will try the gobbler"}
{"text":"The sandwiches are so good, especially the pressed pig, that I have yet to try any of the pizzas."}
{"text":"Gorgeous restaurant!  Friendly employees that are happy to help.  The bread for the sandwiches is to die for.  Regardless of sandwich fillings, I could eat the bread with just butter!    The pizza is equally delicious!!  We enjoyed the margherita pizza very much!  Definitely will return!"}
{"text":"Tasty salads and sandwiches - Got the Cuban sandwich with the cobb side salad...generous portions and always handy to do a half and half with lunch so you can try multiple items. The space is like a Pinterest dream. A little out of the way for me but was close to my friend's house so we decided to try it out. Very chill little lunch spot."}
{"text":"Food is always good.  Never packed when we go there, which is fine by me!  Truly a secret gem!!"}
{"text":"Easy to order.  Trendy setting.  Great selection of pizzas, sandwiches and salads.  They are pretty flexible with order switching.  Make sure to get a combo for lunch, good deal for the amount you get.  Great for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Super good food at good prices. The restaurant is always clean and inviting. My only complaint is the employees never smile and aren't really outgoing."}
{"text":"We come to this place all of the time. 

They have an awesome chop salad. My kids love their pizza.  

I have had the Italian sandwich in the past and it was great too."}
{"text":"I love this place but the online ordering is not the best. They don't have soup option on its own. You can only add the sandwich/soup combo and it doesn't specify that it is a half sandwich and a small side of soup. I love ordering online and the ability to pay online but the online menu is pretty basic and not very clear what you are getting."}
{"text":"Excellent new place.  The food is fresh and tasty.  Fire wood oven - I had the chicken pesto sandwich.  My mom had the caprese sandwich and my dad has the Italian.  All were fantastic.  The place is clean, decorated nicely and a friendly staff.  I will go back again if not get a pizza from there tonight."}
{"text":"What a great place for lunch.  Excellent food and employees were very helpful.  We had the wedge salad and pig sandwich.  Also the pizza and salad combo.  Both were fantastic!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, would love to try the \"Pressed Pig\" sandwich and the \"Wedge\" salad the next time possibly. Would've given a five star but the person at the front was not pleasant. She ruined the experience. No introduction, no acknowledgement or welcome, no information about the menu or what to do next. The way they have it set it is you order take your number to the table and get your plate and condiments, napkins etc and have a seat while your order gets brought to you. She just stood there and wasn't helpful at all. She actually seemed to not care. So that's my review of Local Eats. Hoping the service is better next time."}
{"text":"Picked up carry out today from here, caprese sandwich, which was good, and a cup of tomato basil....the soup was sooooooo salty, it was inedible. I usually use a lot of salt, so for me to say it was too salty, means it tasted terrible. The person making the soup should really taste it before they serve it..."}
{"text":"We just ate at Local eats. The food was good but not exceptional.  I will not return however because the employees did not wear gloves while preparing the food and would answer the phone, handle money etc and go back to preparing food."}
{"text":"Walked over from Shamrock Estates...great local spot! Service is super friendly, salads (Caesar & Wedge) are yummy & pizzas (Fig Caramelized onion Goat cheese & Prosciutto; Herbavore) tasty. Accommodating to children."}
{"text":"I am from Italy and I have tried \"Caprese\" sandwich and to be honest it was such a good sandwich. With a good Mozzarella's cheese and a fantastic bread. The pizza and the salad seemed good too.
While I was eating it I thought that I was eating healthy and so it was.
Can't wait to come back there."}
{"text":"Love the Forager salad with or without chicken.  I ordered the meatballs for my son and he didn't want them so I gave them a try. The best meatballs I've had in a while I ended up eating them too. Definitely recommend this place. The pizza is awesome too as well as there fresh made ciabatta bread."}
{"text":"Quality meal.  Shared a Caprese sandwich and the fig pizza.  Both were excellent.  Highly recommended.  Best $20 meal I've had in a long time."}
