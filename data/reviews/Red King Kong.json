{"text":"I have been waiting for my order and I never got it. Waited a good whole half an hour and whoever behind me has gotten their food. The lady just kept telling me they were making it. Finally had to ask for a refund. 
One would have finished eating at a regular ramen place."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in the first markham. I'm a big ramen fan and this place is fantastic. I highly recommend their Chashu ramen. My only problem is the price but only in comparison to the other food court options at the first markham. It's cheap compared to many ramen place you go in Toronto/GTA."}
{"text":"The soup base tastes good. The meat is nicely torched. The noodle is the straight ramen type. Found the texture can be a slightly softer. In general, it tastes good."}
{"text":"Based on my first and last experience! It was surprisingly good and the price is amazing.

My partner and I had spoke of going back often but didn't get a chance to until today...to find that they are gone!!! 

I wonder if they moved or if business wasn't good =( 
So sad the only Japanese influenced restaurant closed at fmp.."}
{"text":"Popped in this past Saturday to first Markham and saw this place.    Immediately got the craving for warm soup noodles.    Ended up ordering the daily special.   Wait time was about 5 minutes, not that bad.   

This would have been a 5 star but the gyoza included in the combo was a little bland and I wish the egg that came in the soup was a soy egg.

The noodles were good and the portion was quite large.  You get quite a bit of noodles for the price.   It was about $10 for the meal.  

The lady who works here is super nice.    After ordering she told us it would be 5 minutes.   We did a short lap around the mall and when we came back food was waiting (our fault we took too long).   I watched the baby and my wife went to retrieve the food.  The nice lady working there came around the counter and helped carry the second tray.  For food court food you wouldn't expect this kind of courtesy.   She even apologizef if the food was not too hot because it has been sitting but like I said my fault and it was not a problem.  Seasoning of the broth and taste of the dish was still very good.

Would come back again."}
{"text":"Pretty good ramen place in 1st Markham!!! Came here on random n am so glad we ordered from them!!! The soup is perfect and the egg is made just right!! see my pictures and u will know. also the prices are pretty decent as well. They offer daily combo deal as well for $8 to $11. Their noodles from $8.20 to $9.50. Have to say it's above average when compared to some of the places I've been before (restaurant)., not gonna mention where but do give this place a try if you are in 1st Markham!!!"}
{"text":"Red King Kong is a rather new addition to the First Markham Place food court. With a Japanese-inspired menu, the place offers a mini selection of ramen, curry, and appetizers.

Food: 3/5
Ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen (~$9). In this dish there are green onions, bean sprouts with pickled ginger, kombu (seaweed/kelp), and four slices of char siu (roast pork). The first thing I noticed was the neat presentation; a great attention to detail by the chef.

The ramen overall felt a bit lackluster. The pork broth wasn't as rich and heavy as it should be, and the ingredients lacked in both quality and quantity. Roast pork slices were slightly dry, and the veggies didn't seem to add any freshness or flavor. The ramen noodles were thinner than I preferred, but still had a good quality texture to them; in contrast to instant ramen noodles.

Overall, I wouldn't expect anything but average from this place as it is a food court vendor.

Decor:
Food court. Although, the design of the place and menu does have a freshness to it, standing out from the rest of the food court businesses.

Is it worth it?
No, unless you're craving a quick fix. The food isn't overpriced, but it isn't cheap either. The quality of the food is average at most and leaves you with the regret that maybe you should've spent more for both quality and quantity."}
{"text":"Did not have too high expectations for a ramen place at a food court but was pleasantly surprised. Obviously this is no competition to Sansotei or other ramen establishments but for the price the food was good. Would come back again."}
{"text":"Overall, 3.5 compared to other ramen restaurants but for a food court it's a 4. Noodles were a bit like the packaged ramen but soup base was pretty good! We got the spicy cheese ramen and both were pleasantly surprised. We would go back!"}
{"text":"A relatively new addition to FMP food court. We weren't that hungry so we got a Tonkotsu Ramen to share. For about $9 it came with three gyozas which were filled with cabbage and pork and were pretty good. The soup base was not too thick and rich like Ryus, or Santouka downtown, which I enjoyed more, however the noodles seemed to be some kind of Wheat noodle, and not your typical ramen. With Thai, sushi, shanghai, Hong Kong style, and Korean cuisines at the food court, this is a nice addition."}
{"text":"Whoever is making the food better lemme smash. The food is really good, especially the chicken katsu burger and black garlic ramen. They need better spoons though, the plastic ones are child size."}
{"text":"I was quite excited to try ramen at a food court- who wouldn't mind slurping a good and cheap bowl at a food court? However, I was very disappointed that firstly, the ramen is not even ramen - it is some kind of asian noodle that is not chewy like ramen, and secondly, the soup base is not very good. The lack of meat and toppings is similar to some of the authentic ramen joints, but I feel ripped off paying the price they charge when I could eat noodles with lots of meat in the same plaza for cheaper. For this price, I would not eat chinese style noodles with a bland soup base and a few small pieces of meat."}
{"text":"Food:
I tried this place when I stopped in at First Markham Place, and I will definitely continue to eat here.  I can see this place becoming my go-to ramen stop when I'm in that area. It's a good price at $8.20. I had the tonkotsu ramen. The broth was very good, no oily or salty flavour. It was a good portion that left me feeling filled. The veggies were fresh and nicely presented on the top. They had just the right amount of red ginger, so that I could taste and enjoy the flavour, but yet not be overpowered by it.  The noodles were fresh, though it'd be great if there was an option for thick noodles. 

Service:
The service was 5 star. I was greeted with a smile, and heard \"please\" and \"thank you very much.\"  When the lady at the counter saw I had kids with me she brought them those little yogurt drinks, which made them very happy.  Its was nice to have considerate service, when nowadays once-common-courtesies seem to be extinct. A good experience. Give it a try next time you're at FMP."}
