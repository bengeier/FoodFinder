{"text":"Went here during lunch today. Menu looked so good I couldn't decide what to get so I told my AWESOME waitress ANN to pick something for me. She picked the Jerk Chicken Sandwich. There was a symphony of flavors in each bite. Cooked perfectly, spiced wonderfully and excellently presented for lunch. Service (\"Ann\") was really good; she was professional, courteous and very attentive. I really loved the décor of the restaurant. Felt like I was a thousand miles away from Cleveland. Then there was the Key Lime Pie...OUTSTANDING, you can tell it was literally homemade; the meringue was light and fluffy, but the secret was the crust, moist and delicious. What a great experience!

{"text":"Great service, great selection of beer on tap as well. I heard the fish and chips were great, but I just thought they were good taste wise. Huge pieces though, you'll be full if you eat the thick batter as well. As a fish and chip guy, I thought these would have been better though. Recommended!"}
{"text":"I can't argue with $1 happy hour drafts.  That's good stuff.

But I wouldn't go here again with any expectation that I'll eat.

The first time there I had fish tacos and hush puppies.  I was so excited to see fish tacos on a Cleveland menu.  They're still a rare treat.  Alas, these were not decent fish tacos.  They were just completely bland.  Don't do it.  I vaguely remember the hush puppies being ok.

But when I was just back recently to drink, and I ordered hush puppies to soak up the beer, I was crushed.  The pups were just dry, bland balls.  It really shouldn't be that hard to deep fry some flavored bread.  And considering how horrible hush puppies are for your health, it's just not worth eating bad ones.

So go for the happy hour beer, in a small cozy setting.  But don't bother eating unless you prefer your food bland.  The decor is a bit cheesy and overdone, but forgiveable.  There are tvs above the bar, should you be in there on a night the Cavs are playing."}
{"text":"I had always wanted to check this place out for two reasons: I dig seafood and I think mermaids are pretty sweet.  For years I lived under the delusion that this place would be decorated like a swanky grotto with cool lighting and a slightly fancy atmosphere.  I don't know where I got these ideas from because that's certainly not the case.  The inside reminded me of the scary parts of the Pirates of the Caribbean ride.  I'm pretty sure our waiter was drunk.  I'm not judging him, it was just slightly disconcerting.  I ordered fish tacos to start with, another lapse in my mental coordination.  A red flag went up in my head when I saw a cook stick his big, hairy arm through the pass window to show the waiter a cut of something which the waiter sniffed and shrugged at.  I became worried and rightfully so.  The tacos were one of the worst things I have ever tasted.  The smell that hit me as I took my first and only bite was inexplicable.  They were beyond fishy, like dead fish floating for a week in Lake Erie fishy.  The waiter cleared the plate not asking why we weren't eating them or if everything was all right.  Okay, so second stupid move I made was to order the crabby patty or whatever they call their burger with a crab cake on it.  I've made the mistake of ordering crab cakes from other places in the area and I guess I'm a glutton for punishment because I can't seem to get it out of my system.  The crab meat was salty, gritty, and fishy, which was a shame because underneath it all the burger meat was decent.  As for the bar, they do have more than just the typical domestics, but nothing really special.  I might go there for happy hour, but I would stay as far away from their seafood as possible."}
{"text":"Went during happy hour before the Cavs' game.  Had the Shrimp Cocktail and the Crab Cakes from the happy hour menu.  Really enjoyed these especially at a buck each.  The draft Green Flash West Coast IPA was very good.  According to the bartender, it is from San Diego.  I will look for it in California.  Will definitely go back during happy hour next time in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Brown haired waitress is the WORST she completely overcharged our party and took forever with two other people in the building. Seriously go there."}
{"text":"Over all our experience was very pleasant. Thankfully we had nowhere to be at any time, because our wait was a little lengthy. However the environment was very fun and friendly. We sat outside and enjoyed a live band and the time passed quickly.
Our crab cakes were delicious!! Along with their mango walnut salad. 
I was disappointed in my conch ceviche, it lacked any flavor.  Our server was great and took it back, to bring me something else. 
I do recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"The lobster BLT was great. Lobster nachos were great. Not only do they know how to use lobster they season it perfectly. Good selection of beers atmosphere was cool. Service was very good even though it was Saturday night and everything was flying out of the kitchen from nacho to full lobsters dinner."}
{"text":"Positive :Good service
Negative:Lobster Blt was a special on the menu for Saturday, bacon was tuff like beef jerky. Bread toasted and burnt.  Other entrees were not impressive."}
{"text":"Can't taste the food if no one seats you nor greets you.   One server made eye contact but didn't acknowledge guest.   Interesting decor but why bother ??"}
{"text":"We are from Michigan and wanted to find a \"special\"place. We found it here! Our searver and bartender Ann knew the menu very well and mixed the drinks even better. They have 4 different kinds of fresh delicious oysters. We also got the crap dip app which was also amazing. The prices are fair and the decor is welcoming and warm. Check it out you won't be disappointed. Our new Cleveland favorite stop!"}
{"text":"We were in town for the Indians/Yankees game Saturday, and looked on the website to see what time they opened, as we had heard good things about the Bloody Marys. We saw that they opened at 11am according to their website, so we began the 20ish minute walk there from our hotel. While waiting outside at about 10:55am, with 6 or so other people also waiting, a girl opened the door from inside and very rudely said, \"we aren't opening for at least another hour, just so you know\" and promptly slammed the door back behind her with no apology or explanation. We went next door and got a cup of coffee, and upon emerging from the coffee shop, saw the same girl now outside on a smoke break, obviously not working to get the place opened up on time. By the way, the sign outside says they open at 10am on Saturdays. Not sure why they wouldn't want morning business before a 4:10 ball game, but I'll be happy to skip all together next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"***BEST HAPPY HOUR IN CLEVELAND***
On Wednesdays, they have an awesome dollar menu with raw oysters, crab cakes, shrimp and sliders!! Add a 2$ domestic and you are set for an awesome evening on the patio, hanging out in dt cleveland!!"}
{"text":"We ate here for the first time tonight. My wife loved the crabcakes she said they were the best ones she had ever eaten. I had a burger which was very good also and our service was excellent. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Came to the Nauti Mermaid for a bachelorette party only to be greeted by a man behind the bar calling women sugar tits and telling people they could not stay at the bar unless they ordered drinks. Sorry but i'm the designated driver for my best friend during her bachelorette party and I think she and the rest of us deserve better that \"sugar tits.\" Also, TIM apparently told my friend that he wouldnt give her a shot unless she showed him her 'titties'."}
{"text":"Fantastic atmosphere , great food, oysters, crab cakes are awesome.  My friend's dish had a mango salsa that she said was terrific. My made to order hamburger was perfect, beautiful and fun decor. Anna waited on us and was perfect. She made sure we were taken care of without hovering. This is a fun spot with great prices don't miss it if you are in Cleveland. Within walking distance of Public Square,  Casino, Progressive arena, etc. They said they will be putting the outdoor patio furniture outside soon. Rain or shine this is a fun spot to party, family friendly also."}
{"text":"Not a local but thought I would try it out.  Seemed like my style of all the places off 6th. (not including Johnny's Bar But that's a different review)
In these times of economic crisis what can be said for finding a place you can drown your sorrows in $1 miller lites?  S&P tanked no problem, 401k in the toilet no worry.  $1 dollar  miller lites and a variety of apps all a greenback from 4-7
(crab cakes, oysters, sliders, shrimp cocktail min order 3).  Yellow fin tuna sandwich was blackened and tasted great.  I wasn't expecting much but it delivered.  Mind blowing not exactly but hey if your in the mood for some a fish sandwich, cheap beers, cheap apps then head down here.  Seemed like locals were stopping by after work or for get togethers.

Next time back in Cleveland I'll stop by and throw a few bucks their way."}
{"text":"This place is so fun. It's a bit of a dive bar but that is what makes it so fun. atmosphere is fun and funky. Drinks are reasonable and food is good! It's a place where you can definitely relax and be yourself. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"This was my first stop after arriving in Cleveland. We were starving and looking for a quick lunch. I was dining with three other guests and we each ended up picking out the Mahi Mahi entree. Do not order this - all four of us barely could eat anything on our plates. I managed to take a few bites of the Caribbean rice but that was lacking as well. 
Maybe other dishes on the menu are better, but after looking over the reviews it seems to be a trend.
A few nights later we did stop in for late night drinks and grabbing a few drinks here was a lot of fun!"}
{"text":"The worst service ever! Went with two girlfriends recently for happy hour and the b$@%&-# of a server was so rude to us. Little does she know were all bartenders and would have tipped very well. I will never go back there. EVER!"}
{"text":"Was in town for a conference and the hotel staff recommended the Nauti.  When we arrived it was packed and we had to wait about 20 min. for a booth.  It was definitely worth it.  I had the walleye platter and it was excellent.  The price is also very reasonable.  Don't forget to try the Key Lime pie.  Awesome!"}
{"text":"DO NOT GO!!! In town for a wedding and this might be my worst meal ever. We were literally the only ones at the establishment and it took over an hour to get. The food was cold and not  edible. Right now we are waiting for the check and it's taking her 10 min so far to swipe a credit card. They are out of coffee. How are you out of coffee??? They said the food took over an hour because of crab legs. I'm sorry but crab legs take 5 min to boil. The crab cake benedict was disgusting and was not real crab. Disgusting. Absolutely disgusting."}
{"text":"We found the Nauti Mermaid by accident.  We haven't been to Cleveland in a while, it was Labor Day so a bit quiet downtown and we really didn't know where to eat. We were looking for an outdoor patio and there were a few in this section of W.6th but the menu for the Nauti Mermaid won out!  The atmosphere was terrific, the blues music was great and the service  was friendly and prompt. The food took quite a while to come out but when you have great conversation going, we didn't really notice.  It was definitely worth the wait. The soup was really different and very tasty. We also ordered mussels, crab cakes, chicken wings, and lobster nachos. Everything was very good and nothing was leftover. The servers we're attentive but not pushy.  Can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"Downtown and looking for some looking for some seafood bites?  Then why not hit up the Nauti Mermaid.  Nestled in the heart of West 6, this little seafood joint is just the spot for grabbing everything from raw oysters to lobster nachos (and yes, they also have non-seafood menu items in case you were wondering).  

This has kind of turned into a random happy hour spot when the bf and our friends are craving some oysters.  And honestly, you can't beat it.  I'm not an oyster fan but the boys are and they all say these are great.  So fresh oysters, and on Wednesday for $0.65 a pop?  What's not to like?

We've tried a little bit of everything - crab cakes, peel and eat shrimp cocktail, the nachos (AMAZING), fish piled on a pretzel bun, conch ceviche - and while it's not the BEST food we've ever had, it's far from the worst and we can always guarantee that we'll leave full and happy.  Throw in a $1 miller light draft special from 4-7 and you can get boozy on the cheap, too.  

So stop in, grab a table (they have a nice little patio), and get your seafood fix at the Mermaid."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, cool atmosphere.  Can't beat the happy hour prices. Bartender Ann was very friendly and welcoming.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We used to really love going to the Nauti Mermaid. The reasons were: every day they had a different \"special happy hour\" item for $1 a piece. Like one dollar oysters, one dollar shrimp cocktail, one dollar sliders...you get the picture. And it was very good. We recommended it to everyone we knew and took lots of people there. Then something happened at the Nauti M. Every time we went there, we had a different server. Did this mean the management was funky? At one point about  a year ago we just decided to bag it and not go any more. The food quality was uneven, and the place was dirty and service was iffy, too. They pared down the menu and got rid of a lot of the more interesting stuff. They also jacked up the prices to \"fine dining\" level. So we thought, well, for \"fine dining\" level prices, we'll go somewhere else and get some \"fine dining\" food and service. About two months ago we gave it another try. We sat at our favorite table in the window (great for people watching) and ordered all of the happy hour stuff and a couple bottles of wine. We had little crab cakes, oysters, shrimp, and sliders. This time the policy was: all of these things were on happy hour every week day between 5-7; the policy keeps changing. We had a fun time, our server was adorable and on the ball, and the food was good. So we went again. What a difference two weeks makes. We sat at our favorite table again. We ordered a bottle of wine and a beer. We waited and waited and  (literally) 20 minutes later the server came back and informed us that the wine wasn't in stock and he forgot the beer. So we started all over again. He had one variety of Chardonnay. We ordered that. It was another 20 minutes before he came back. At this point we were a little testy. Don't keep restaurant customers waiting for their beverages! Rule number one. We asked what the happy hour food was. He got really surly at that point and said that if we wanted happy hour food we would have to go and sit at the bar. HUH? New rule! He told us \"the bartenders get mad because they're not making any money\" and that's why they changed the policy. Ohhhkay. So we ordered regular price menu items. My husband and I ordered the one pound perch fish fry with cole slaw and green beans. Previously the portions had been very large, so we figured that would be plenty for us. My sister in law ordered the seared sesame tuna, which she has had several times before and really enjoyed. Bro-in-law got the sliders, which we have all had before and loved, with Blue Cheese ($1 extra). At this point we ordered another bottle of wine and more beer because it was clear that he wouldn't be back for a looong time. We also asked nicely if he could please turn down the music one notch. There was a speaker directly over our heads, and it was blasting hair metal. He snapped \"it's happy hour, and our bar customers like the music loud\". We glanced over at the three people sitting at the bar. I just sighed. So, a half hour later the food came. My sister in law's tuna was inedible. It was really tough and sinewy, and the sauce tasted like motor oil. She asked my brother in law to place it on the booth next to ours because it made her nauseous just to look at it. When the server placed the fish fry in front of my husband and me, we both looked at it with utter amazement. There were three finger-sized  shriveled-up  over-fried filets on the plate, a little bowl of cabbage (no dressing,) and a few green beans. The total weight of the fish couldn't have been more than two ounces. I said to the server \"um, this is not a pound of fish\". He sneered \"this is how the kitchen sent it out\". I said \"well, the menu shouldn't say a pound if it's not a pound\". He just flounced off. When he came back about twenty minutes later, he saw the plate of uneaten tuna on the other table and spat \"I guess there was something wrong with THIS as well!\" And we said \"yes, it was inedible\". My brother in law also didn't get his blue cheese on his burgers, and the buns were yellow squishy buns from Dave's Supermarket's Bargain Bin. The whole meal was disgusting. We told the server all of this, and he snapped again. \"Well, I can comp the food but I can't comp the beverages.\" We had not asked for anything free. We were going for edible. Clearly he had some prior issues with unhappy customers. He was so surly and unpleasant the entire time that the combination of his attitude and the terrible food really ruined the dinner. We got our check and left. He got a $5 tip, which is not our style AT ALL, but someone had to send this guy the message that the restaurant business is not his best career path. As we were getting into our car, we saw him running out of the place with his hair on fire, looking up and down the street so he could ...yell at us?  Demand more money? What was his intention? We were still hungry, since none of the food was edible, so we ran over to Bar Cento and had a fantastic plate of fries and a yummy pizza."}
{"text":"This place proves people will eat anything if they can do it outside.  Food was below average. Soggy muffin, broken hollandaise and cold lobster for the Benedict.   Cold potatoes.  Bloody was good.  The poor waiter was just out of his league.  Dirty table.  He didn't offer coffee.  No salt, pepper or ketchup on the tables for the potatoes.  He didn't ask if a wanted more coffee or drinks.  Had to go to the bar to pay the bill.  This isn't the boy's fault.  He needs more training and support from the non-existent manager of the place."}
{"text":"Worst meal of my life!!!!! I went to the west 6th festival last year and I loved the food I sampled at Nauti Mermaid, so I jumped at the chance to buy a coupon on restaurant.com ($25 gift card for $2.)  I finally harassed my friend to go with me last week and I will live to regret it, according to him it will be for the rest of my life.  Started out okay for him he ordered the crab cakes as an appetizer I ordered the calamari...horrible!!!  It was overcooked and they served it to me with marinara sauce??  Next up I ordered the salmon club and my friend got the rum glazed salmon both equally gross, the rum glaze tasted more like caramel syrup and my salmon was the most putrid thing I've ever tasted or smelled.  After we sent them back our waitress was nice enough to tell us that they just cut the fish, I would've preferred she say nothing then outright lie because there was no way that fish was just cut!  To tied us over until our next entree came we ordered the soup of the day the \"Jalapeño lobster soup\" which according to our waitress was \"Awesome.\"  More like awesomely bad!!!  It was covered in oil and it tasted like tuna fish in cheese sauce, needless to say neither one of us finished it.  For our reorders my friend got the chicken ceasar salad and I ordered the mussels in a tomato sauce reduction.  At this point my friend was so terrified of food poisoning he didn't even try his salad.  As for my mussels that sauce was no reduction!  It was so thick I had to pour my water on it just to get rid of all that sauce.  To my surprise the mussels weren't, but I was so full off of bad food I didn't finish it.  We were very surprised to see that the restaurant was packed considering the food was so gross until we noticed everyone was drinking not eating.   I have 2 more of these coupons and I couldn't get rid of them fast enough!  I might've kept them if I could use em on alcohol but such is not the case..."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I heard a very funny commercial for this place on our long drive to Cleveland and decided we just had to try it, and it was totally worth it! This place had very friendly staff, and terrific food! I had the salmon in the buffalo wing and house rum sauce while my boyfriend had the sliders and perch platter (with sides of deep fried corn on the cob and mashed potatoes). We were both full up (that's saying something since we joke that he has a hallow leg to store all the food he eats in) and very pleased with such an excellent meal! 

You should definitely go here if you like sea food! (They have burgers too!)"}
{"text":"Well, I love seafood & I love small bars so we figured a Monday would be a nice night to try this little spot we had heard about from a friend because I assumed it would be slow.

Well, I was right about it being a slow night, but I guess the service figured they could be slow too. We sat at the bar where there was plenty of room since there was no host or greeter or sign saying you could seat yourself. (I realized later that everyone else who walked in just sat themselves at an open booth or spot as well.) We sat at the end of the bar & at the other end was a group of people who seemed to be friends with the bartender because they received excellent service getting shot after shot after shot. In the meantime, my boyfriend finished his beer & had it sitting on the end of the bar for a good while until he decided to come back around & ask if he wanted another & then decided to present us with menus.

I ordered the oyster po-boy which next time, if there is one, I'll ask for the bread not to be grilled or thrown in the oven because it was hard to eat & burned. The oysters were great & so was the corn on the cob I ordered. My boyfriend ate the jerk chicken sandwich with fries & he seemed to thoroughly enjoy them. 

Everyone that worked there seemed rather angry & just wanting the night to end, which I've been in that situation but you still have to suck it up & put a smile on your face. I more than likely won't return, as there are so many other great restaurants in Cleveland but who knows, I may have a hankering for some lobster & this place seems to suit the bill for good, fresh from the tank in the front of the restaurant, inexpensive lobster."}
{"text":"It's not just seafood.  They also offer burger and pork.  A great variety of summer drinks.  I am giving them a four star due to the food. I ordered a fried mahi sandwich and fried corn on the Cobb.  It came out grilled, they were great about re making it, which I was fine with, unfortunately the corn was from the original grilled sandwich which was sent back.  A friend of mine had the lobster rolls and fries.  The fries came out pretty cold.  Besides that all around great place."}
{"text":"As a former North Coaster, visiting Cleveland is now (at least) a yearly event for my wife and I, just for the enjoyment and fun that is Cleveland. 

We were casting about on Yelp for somewhere to find a decent pint and some oysters one afternoon when we were excited to discover that we were staying just a short hop from a place called the Nauti Mermaid. After stopping in, we are thrilled to have found it. 

Now, Cleveland is generally one of the friendliest places going overall and this establishment adds to that reputation. The par tender and server were verity personable, showed a great level of interest in being helpful, and were just plain nice! You should definitely go for Happy Hour. Blue Points on the half shell for $10/dozen. WOW! Not getting into the controversy over the use of the \"Blue Point\" name, we will attest to the quality of the oysters. They were properly briny and fresh tasting. The special jalapeño cocktail sauce is amazing. 

We also enjoyed the \"Steamed Mussels Provencale - one pound of mussels in a red wine broth with garlic, butter, basil, tomato and red pepper flakes\" at the happy hour price of $5. Again, WOW!

Add the pretty good selection of craft beers and you can't beat this place. We hope to get back soon to try more of the menu - this restaurant certainly helps fuel our desire to make the 4 hour drive to Clevo more often."}
{"text":"First time here! 
This place is great!  Good bar food, live music and the staff is friendly and attentive!  Good selection of beers both on tap and bottled.  Gotta go here!!!"}
{"text":"The Nauti Mermaid was fantastic. 

When we got there the inside turned us off a little bit. They had a blues musician playing and we could barely hear each other. Also, there were 4 guys drinking by themselves at the bar. We decided before we got our food that this place wasn't for us.

Then our appetizer came. Lobster Nachos. They were incredible. 

For my main dish, I got the surf and turf burger. Essentially it is a crab cake on top of a burger. Delicious. 4/5 because of the loud music. Our server was great as well. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Average food. Average service. Only plus- went on a beautiful day and was able to sit outside."}
{"text":"Realistically, I'd probably give this place 3.5. Great food and atmosphere, but the service left a bit to be desired. 

Went here with my boyfriend because I was really in the mood for crab legs and we had never tried this place before. Walking in, I knew I would like the atmosphere. It's casual and not at all stuffy, which I love. All the kitschy stuff on the walls made me feel like I was at the beach--very nice in the freezing Cleveland winter! We hovered awkwardly at the door for a couple minutes--no host stand but no instructions, do we seat ourselves? Is any one of the four people looking at us going to tell us what to do? A simple \"seat yourself\" sign would do wonders! Asked a girl if we could get a table and she seriously looked at us, looked around the restaurant for a couple seconds, then goes, \"Well none of the tables are open.\" No explanation, just telling us something we clearly knew. It was like, well duh, we just didn't know if there was a wait list! Thankfully some nice ladies saved me from the incredulous look on my face and said they were leaving so we could have their table. Now the same girl who told us there were no tables was our server. We ordered the happy hour crab cakes (it was 6:50; happy hour ends at 7) and she tried to tell us happy hour was over. Now this girl is REALLY rubbing me the wrong way. I just won't order anything if you're going to try to weasel more money out of me. Thankfully once we pointed out the time she really had no choice but to serve us what we asked for, and luckily at this point another girl started serving us. 

The crab cakes were awesome. The aioli was delicious. I would definitely order these again. My boyfriend got the grouper and I, of course, ordered the crab legs I had been craving. The grouper was awesome. It had an almost maple flavor to it--very unique and delicious. And the crab legs, OMG! They are the HUGE Alaskan ones. Cooked perfectly. Absolutely no complaints about the food. We left feeling incredibly satisfied. 

Food--5 stars, no doubt.
Service--2 stars. Did not like the attitude and the unclear nature of the seating. Like I said, just put up a simple sign. Not everyone is a regular!"}
{"text":"I've been to many places where crowds are big and rude, but have never experienced service as awful as I did at the Nauti Mermaid.  The bartenders were arguing and I was told to leave just for waving one of the team down.  It was bizarre and disrespectful.  When I've eaten there in the past, food was mediocre and service was just okay."}
{"text":"I was so excited when I went here for the first time and they had Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Ale.  But now they don't anymore.  They also don't have Strongbow :(

At least my mixed drinks were fairly strong.  There was live music that wasn't great but didn't suck."}
{"text":"We were visiting from Ft. Wayne, IN & trying a bunch of different restaurants. Someone recommended this place and we're glad they did. Our server, Ann, was the sweetest thing ever! She had SO much personality and made us feel very welcome! She was unbelievably on the ball with our order and drinks. She even wrote a little note on our receipt, which was super sweet! I tried the chicken tortilla soup, which was very good. Hubby tried the mussels....no complaints at all!! We'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Great food... A little hole in wall. A bit pricey but totally worth it great waitstaff. I would definitely suggest it to anyone."}
{"text":"Went last night for dinner and sat outside. Based on yelp reviews, I was expecting a decent place to grab dinner. Wrong! It took 10+ minute to get a drink. We put in our order immediately for an appetizer and two entrees (one included a salad). 30 minutes went by, no appetizer / no salad. Asked the server for an update and she didn't have one. Really? You should probably be checking on your food for your tables. She didn't come back. Another 10 minutes passed, making it a 40 minute wait--no server, no appetizer or salad. We put a $10 on the table for the one drink we ordered and left. We got down the block and the server came running down accusing us of not paying for our drink. We explained why we left and said we left a $10. She tried to say our appetizer was finally out, but if that were true, she would have seen the $10 and not have come running down yelling at us.

I have worked in the industry for many years and I know how things can get, and she tried to say it was not her fault but the place was not that busy, and she could have came to give an update, check on our food...do something. 

I would never go back."}
{"text":"I know it's a seafood place, but I wish they would offer other vegetarian options rather than fries, salad or quesadilla. :( 

So if you're vegetarian or someone who is, probably don't go here."}
{"text":"Okay.  I'm a HUGE fan of the Nauti Mermaid!

As someone who grew up spending summers in coastal New England, I'm a big seafood guy.  So... a bar in Ohio with a seafood theme??  Pretty unique!  That alone gives it points in my book.

The service is standard.  However, the food is FANTASTIC (although a bit pricey).  They have some inspired seafood dishes that you won't find in most places.  Portions are VERY big.  I ordered standard fish-and-chips last time and it was enough food for 2 easily!

What I love most about this place isn't any tangible thing, it's the PURPOSE the Nauti Mermaid serves.  It's in middle of W 6th Street... surrounded by the main Cleveland bars and clubs.  It's the perfect place to START your Friday or Saturday night.  Go out with some friends, get some drinks, get some food... and then decide if you really want to walk down the street to \"party\"... or if you just want to keep it low key and stay put.

SUMMARY:  Relaxed, low-pressure atmosphere... perfect place to start your night out downtown... great seafood... slightly pricey... funny decor"}
{"text":"The Bartenders are the most unprofessional, besides the Friday Night Manager(Demonte) who Bartend' on Friday, the rest are veeery  unprofessional. Unfortunately there aren't many seafood restaurants in the down town area (if any at all) you'll have very few options of places to go.
      Customer Service at the Bar is lackluster, and it is one of those business establishments that has its regulars patronize it regularly. I wouldn't advise ant new patrons to go there only under desperate circumstances."}
{"text":"DON'T RISK GETTING FOOD POISONING AT THIS DISGUSTING PLACE.. It's over priced and tastes like it's out of a can. It's so greasy and not edible. All seafood tasted rotten and we all questioned the off taste. We were reprimanded by the manager whom was the most unprofessional and nasty person I've come in contact with. I never felt so put down.. He told us the food was eaten and therefor we can pay the bill and never come back because it is a family place and that our kind isn't welcome. Which is ridiculous because we all tasted this \"food\" and asked for the manager because something was wrong it was barely touched one bite was enough to know something wasn't right. The food and help was nasty all in all.. yuck!!!! I went home and 8 hours later I vomited the next 24 hrs. Should've brought the food home as evidence since I was forced to pay a whopping 100$ for garbage that made me extremely sick! Please do not waste you precious time on such a terrible place. NOT EDIBLE.."}

It was on our walk to the stadium so we thought we'd stop in for a couple of drinks and some appetizers. Right away we noticed the ocean themed décor inside of the restaurant and the very fishy menu (duh, it is named the Nauti Mermaid). I love seafood, but my boyfriend not so much. However there were still items on the menu that were non seafood for him to choose from! 

The waitress came over to us right away and was very friendly/helpful in our drink and food selection. We started with the shrimp cocktail and sliders, which to our pleasant surprise came with three decently sized burgers. I also ordered a lobster roll because I was a little hungrier than he was. The filling inside of the roll had a pretty good amount of lobster chunks, which is something you look for when you order a lobster roll. It was quite delicious as were our other appetizers. However, the roll that the lobster came in was a little bit hard so I ended up eating it out of the roll with a fork. Still tasty though. It also came with a side of onion rings which I wasn't a fan of. The breading was too heavy and greasy for my liking. As for our drinks...I ordered a blue moon and a strawberry mojito and he ordered a vodka and lemonade? (I think...idk it was one of their specialty drinks). Overall, it was a pretty pleasant experience and not too pricey for serving seafood. If I ever go back, I would definitely like to try the crab legs and lobster nachos. So I hope I make it back some day!"}
{"text":"This is a great brunch spot on a weekend. I ordered the Crab Cake Benedict and the crab cakes were delicious! Even the fruit on the plate that is served as a side was ripe and delicious. I would suggest sitting outside to eat only because I find the inside to be a bit dreary."}
{"text":"I'll admit that when we were here, it was late afternoon on a Sunday, but that really didn't influence my feelings all that much. I can see this place being better with a number of changes, one being a different time and day so that there are more people and it's not like a ghost town.

The food actually wasn't bad! We had crab legs and there were a couple of other dishes on the table that no one complained about. The biggest complaint among my dining companions was the service, which was, admittedly a little slow especially because there were only a few other tables of diners, but I wasn't too bothered by it. What I was bothered by, though, was the lack of cleanliness. The window we sat by was shockingly messy. It felt like we were dining behind a sneeze screen...except we were on the wrong side of it. 

The whole place needs a good deep cleanse and the staff could brush up on their skills. Then I'd consider coming back, but until then I'll be going elsewhere for my kitschy seafood decor and crab legs."}
{"text":"We got here in time for Happy Hour, which resulted in some good mixed drinks for $5 each and some very good appetizer crab cakes. The dinners we had were good but not great, however the fries were better than average. Nothing to rave about but not bad."}
{"text":"Food = 5 (oysters rockefeller & lobster mac&cheese were out of this world good)
Price = 5
Experience = (Great service by cute woman in a wife beater... nice look)

Really great music by Kristine Jackson... sexy low voice and cool style."}
{"text":"I picked up an UberEats delivery here. Understandable that a restaurant in downtown Cleveland, on a Thursday evening, can be busy. Walk in, talked to 4 different servers and was told to talk to 3 different bartenders. I was getting thrown back and fourth for about 15 minutes. No one had any clue what to tell me. Talked to a manager, finally, he smacks me on the shoulder and says \"Well... Yeah, can't you see we're getting our asses kicked right now?!\"... I waited 5 more minutes, he walked past me and goes back to doing whatever. I will never give this establishment any money, nor will I recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Like my bestie Bobo said, and married but still smokin' Murray pointed out,  I had avoided the Nauti Mermaid for years because I assumed it was like all the other W. 6th hambone havens, but maybe worse because what's worse than sweaty meatheads slurping down crab legs? I was WRONG. Damn! I missed out on years of fun by letting my hambone hating, small headedness keep me away. Nauti Mermaid is not a club, it's not really a restaurant, but a tavern, a bar with booths where you can sit and eat, but you'd better have a beer while you're doing it. It's kitschy, not classy, and refers to the restroom as \"the head.\" If you don't have a good time at Nauti Mermaid, than I hate you. Or, maybe you should just give it another chance because everyone and every place has off nights. But, I'm not ruling out the possibility that I hate you."}
{"text":"I loved the aesthetic of this bar. It's got that old wooden charm that I enjoy. I would call this a dive bar but it's one step above I think. 

It's definitely clean, with attentive staff, and offers a seafood-themed menu that was mostly appetizers and raw bar items. 

There is a nautical theme here that is cool. They are going for a look like you're in the cabin of a ship. Definitely a cool place to wander in to. Drinks are reasonably priced. We didn't order food but it seemed fairly priced as well."}
{"text":"Given the numerous negative reviews related to wait times and poor service, we were hesitant to give the Nauti Mermaid a try.  We could not have been more pleasantly surprised.  We arrived around 8pm on a Tuesday.  We were immediately seated and our drink orders taken.  We ordered a Key Lime Pie Martini and a Rum Runner.  Drinks were served in less than 10 minutes and our meal order taken.  The Rum Runner was good and I would order it again.  The Key Lime Pie was outstanding and I did order it again. Our meals were served 10 minutes after our drinks.  Entrees were the Lobster BLT and the mahi mahi sandwich.  The mahi mahi was very good.  The Lobster BLT was outstanding!  Both breads were fresh and flakey.  Both sandwich breads may have had a little too much butter but it did add to the flavors.  Key Lime Pie for dessert and it was good but too much meringue for my taste.  Everything we ordered was fresh with superb flavor.  Our server was Chris and I cannot begin to say how wonderful he was.  He greated us at the door and seated us immediately.  He patiently answered our many questions and made outstanding recommendations.  He was right on target with his suggestions.  Chris was extremely attentive to our needs without being intrusive.  His service was amazing.  So, my final word is this, I'm glad we did not follow the majority of the reviews and took a chance on the Nauti Mermaid.  This place was well worth it.  I hope you enjoy it as much as we did.  And ask for Chris, he's great!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar she was perfect. Suggested crab cakes, they were ALL Crab,Yum :-) could add more small craft beers."}
{"text":"All of their seafood is frozen so don't go in there expecting the fresh catch of the day.  If you want that, go across the street to Blue Pointe.  The food is very average and is highly dependent upon who is in the kitchen.  Nauti Mermaid is a good spot to grab a casual beer and watch some games or chat with the bartenders.  They do get a random crowd in there, which depending on what type of scene you desire, can be good or bad."}
{"text":"I've been here twice - once for food, and once for the nightlife.

Food: I got a cheeseburger for lunch one day, and it was...well, it was fine. Nothing to write home about. I had brought my laptop so I could study vocab for the GRE (mooching off of the nearby Starbucks wifi), and they were very nice about letting me sit there and work (the place was half empty, otherwise I would have moved once I was done). My waitress was a little rude at the start of my meal, but made up for it by being nice and attentive the rest of the time. Perhaps she had just been irked by her previous customer?

Nightlife: Two words: weird crowd. My roommate had warned me of this, but we stopped by anyway because I couldn't resist the name of this place. Yes, it's a dive bar, but still...lots of single older men, and not the good kind. The bartender was nice enough, but my roommate and I each got our one drink and left. I will say that the bartender also didn't know what a 7&7 was - but maybe he was just new? 

I probably won't be back to Nauti Mermaid, but I do still love the name..."}
{"text":"What a great little hidden gem! I was in Cleveland for the weekend and I wanted some Oysters and Beer. The atmosphere was better than I imagined! Just because I wanted some seafood didnt mean that I wanted to sit in an upscale restaurant- Nauti Mermaid was comfortbale, fun, and had a playful ocean themed atmosphere. They had plenty of beers on tap. Everyone I was with enjoyed their experience!... I would give them 5 stars... but the chances of everyone in your group wanting seafood is slim so I would recomend adding more non-seafood choices."}
{"text":"Horrible. Staff was terrible. Took forever for anyone to come to our table. Took forever for our drinks. Over priced. Ordered the crab legs which was way more expensive than any other place I've ever been. Crab was way over cooked dry with no flavor. Worst crab legs I've ever had. If the service would have been better I could understand why they charge so much but really 125$ for two meals. AWFUL experience!"}
{"text":"Not what you would expect to find on West 6th Street... in a good way! Excellent food and happy hour and the service is amazing. It draws a different crowd that the younger targeted demographic of Barley House, Tequila Ranch, etc."}
{"text":"Went last night with two friends.. E4th Street had waits as long as an hour and we were just too hungry for that. Bellied up to the bar; which was dwindling with maybe five people, two business men and then three maybe out for a happy hour drink or two. Bartender was prompt enough with his \"what can I get for you\" but after further speculation when my friend asked what they had on tap and he had no idea what the difference was between any of the beers our experience took a turn for the worse. We settled on the IPA that he recommended only to take a sip and realize it was an American Strong Ale and nothing like the hoppy-treat we were expecting. Fine, beer is beer. 

We ordered crabcakes, a burger, jerk chicken and a salmon BLT--- when the food finally did come out it was sans crabcakes which our server never mentioned. Whatever; we were hungry and the food that we did get was decent. When we were finally able to snag the barkeep again who simply wrote us off as soon as we got our food and never got refills again (place wasn't packed maybe 10 people at the bar at this point) we asked for an itemized bill to make certain that we were charged for the MIA crabcakes; which again he never acknowledged with even as much as an \"I'm so sorry I forgot\" and then went on his merry way.

Truth be told I have been here before many moons ago with a work crew and like I said this wasn't our first choice of restaurant.... now I remember why."}
{"text":"Once I find something I like I usually stick with it and become known to order the same items by the staff.  Here, I always order the Nauti pasta with white sauce with a side of their onion rings! These two items are a must-try and arguably the best dishes they offer.  Best onion rings I have had, and the pasta is filled with fresh and and tasteful shrimp and lobster!  The white sauce for the pasta is to-die-for and my only critique of the dish is to offer more.  The price is reasonable, but I believe the pasta portion should be more for what they're charging.  Maybe it's just so good I can not get enough, or maybe I have a valid point; don't know as I'm biased to my stomach ;).  Oysters are fresh and nice, but not quite as clean, or large as those from Blue Point.  Overall a great place to eat with a casual and friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"Wanted to love this place, but they made it tough. Party of 8 on a Friday evening, but we were early trying to avoid Cavs game crowd. Started in bar for awhile - great drinks, but small crowd seemed to overwhelm 1 bartender. Seemed like great guy and very hardworking, but drink orders took forever. Bar was busy but not crowded. Restaurant was not busy at all....most booths full and we were only table in other side. Appetizers not served together and one - clams on half shell- took forever. Appetizers tasted great. Entrees were not so good. Being fish fry Friday, several of us got fish & chips or other deep-fried fish dinners. All were cooked too long - dark, super crispy and dry. Onion rings and French fries were over cooked and tasted of old grease. 

Cool spot. Probably fun in warm weather to sit on patio. Management not in touch with real issues so service stinks. Owner in bar with patrons instead of helping out. Oh w"}
{"text":"Friendly wait staff, comfortable atmosphere and cheap beer . Lobster was a little over cooked"}
{"text":"Won't be coming back, sat at the bar for 30 minutes and was not offered a drink, not interested in spending money at a place that isn't interested in serving me, there are too many great bars out for that. Goodbye nauti mermaid"}
{"text":"Holy nautical theme!  
I've always been afraid of this place 1. because it's on west sixth and 2. because I hate nautical anything.
Surprisingly I really enjoyed the nautical theme.  Gave it a different kind of atmosphere than the traditional downtown bar.  I also thought the atmosphere was very laid back and chill.  
Haven't tried the food yet, but if you want to meet up with some friends in the downtown area and don't feel the need to dress like trash, then try it out."}
{"text":"Another great gem I discovered in downtown Cleveland (Warehouse district).  I came in Monday for Lobster special and it was delicious!  I also got the deep fried corn and it was tasty.  Very casual with great beer selection."}
{"text":"We stopped here for drink and dinner for a friend's birthday. I was looking forward to visiting this place, since I had heard such good things about it. 

Service was great. Beer was good. The spicy fish tacos were pretty bland except for the chiptle sour cream. The red skin potatoes I got for a side were sitting in oil. Not good. 

My friend enjoyed his beer battered cod and deep fried corn cob. My other friend was disapointed in her salmon gyro and hush puppies. The hush puppies tasted plain. They used to be more  corn bread. 

She said the food quality had changed since her last visit.

Maybe it was an off night, but I was disapointed."}
{"text":"Came for Saturday brunch with a group. Food took an hour and a half. Food was cold and not good. I got the beef hash which was supposed to come with eggs but the server brought it out without eggs and when I asked she said it doesn't come with eggs. The beef was tough and not good. The food didn't come out together. Many orders were not correct. It took another 30 minutes to get the syrup for the French toast. Overall very poor experience. Bad food and bad service = bad restaurant. Worst of all my companion got a fruit cup that only came with cantaloupe, he hates cantaloupe."}
{"text":"One star ONLY because I had to choose something. This review is strictly based on customer service. I never received the order so I can't comment on the actual food.
   
I placed an order for delivery through Yelp / Grubhub at 8:16pm on Friday, April 6th. Someone from Nauti called to state that an item that I ordered was no longer available (calamari) and I needed to contact GrubHub to have it refunded, which I did. 

One hour and a half later I called to check on my order and was initially told that there were no orders for delivery. When I explained that I had ordered via Grubhub I was then told that the order was just received. I told them that was not true as I had spoken with someone over an hour ago concerning an item (calamari) that was no longer available. They insisted that the order was just received even stating that \"Grubhub just faxed over the order\". 

Once explaining for about a 5th time the guy asks someone (maybe a manager) if they wanted to take the call and a background voice says \"put it on hold\". So now I'm just holding the line, without any warning, for the management team to come up with a lie. 

Someone different comes back on the line (the girl who called me initially to state that the calamari was not available) and she starts by saying \"I have bad news\". Then she says Grubhub stopped delivering at 10:00pm so we can't complete your order. 

As I had already paid over $30 for delivery and had already left a 20% tip, I called Grubhub to get a full refund. 

In the end - grubhub was not responsible for delivering, the restaurant had its in delivery driver so management lied about that. The order had been received for almost two hours so management lied about that as well. Supposedly there was no manager on site until the next day (very weird for a restaurant to not have a manager on duty) so I'll just assume that was a lie as well. The person who answered the phone was new and \"misunderstood\" what I was saying, that's why he stated that the order was just received - that is a Big Fat Lie - the background voice (probably the manager) told him to say the order was just received. 

They could have just admitted their mistake that the check was either lost, misplaced or forgotten - but they choose to lie instead SMH. 

I still needed dinner so I ordered from Project: Pizza - it was fast, fresh, hot and delicious. So if you're staying in the downtown Cleveland area go with Project: Pizza or another restaurant - listening to the background on the phone, The Nauti Mermaid seemed unorganized, dysfunctional and poorly managed... and oh yeah, they lie as well!"}
{"text":"Gender-polymorphic manager refuses to speak with us. 
The shrimp quesadilla was tasty, and the oysters were decently fresh. That's about all you can expect out of the two hours you spend waiting for your check. I feel bad for the poor girl who waited on us, stating it was her second day. As it turns out, many employees have stayed away. A sign in the filthy bathroom indicates they are hiring for every position, overworked and underpaid, with poor management, seems to be the condition. The manager was busy, or was she in the basement? Actually, he too busy, speaking with his friends. Wait, what? The servers don't even know the gender of their manager, nor know of a way to find him/her anywhere."}
{"text":"The Nauti Mermaid has a very good happy hour, with a few $5 food specials.  I've also done a fair bit of take out fromOutside of the happy hour, the fish tacos and mahi-mahi sandwich are tasty.  Avoid the bisque as it much too creamy.  The jerk chicken is a good choice if you are looking for a non-seafood option.

The restaurant itself is very cozy with several 4-person booths and perhaps a dozen seats at a small bar. They also had live music during the Friday happy hour I attended, which we all agreed was more annoying that enjoyable especially given how loud it gets in a small space with wood walls from the usual restaurant commotion."}
{"text":"Neat seafood nautical atmosphere. Our waitress was awesome. I hadn't heard of gal their beers on tap so she let me sample a few before making a decision. We dont get seafood very often so we splurged on having the lobster and king crab legs. Both were delicious. The sides were okay (onion rings were over cooked and needed some kind of dipping sauce). I wouldn't necessarily seek out this restaurant a second time but I'd recommend for anyone looking for seafood in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I don't know how to say it politely: the food here is disgusting.  Like some others, we came here from out-of-town based on the good Yelp reviews.  We sat outside, and we didn't have the slow service that some others had.  But the table was dirty, the food was literally inedible.  Whatever was in the quesadilla tasted like wallpaper paste and my husband's oysters were old and gross.  We got up and left after our appetizers.

Oh yes and the waitress didn't know what \"ale\" is."}
{"text":"This place seemed like a casual bar, go seat yourself. We'd made reservation like it was fancy we heard about the lobster. They did not disappoint the lobster was delicious drip off your chin butter and great portion size. I had mine with the muscles. We'll go back there."}
{"text":"This place is the definition of a DIVE(in a good way)
                   -Great place to meet friends after work or the gym in buisness casual or casual.
                   -On select nights there is live music
                   -They will put on any sporting event in Cleveland on any of their TV's.  
                   -AWESOME drink and food specials, especially if you are on a budget
                                -$1 draft of the month 5-7 M-F, Super happy hour including, $1 sliders, and $1 oysters 
                                -My favorite specials include:
                                            -Monday's fresh Maine Lobster with two sides for $22 
                                                            -The lobster is FRESH and hand picked in their aquarium once you order
                                            -Tuesday's 12oz New York Strip with a delish red wine demiglace with 2 sides for $12
                                                            -This is a substantial steak with nice girth and width.  The steak was cooked very nicely and a deep, warm,  pink juicy center just as I had asked.  

Overall, I enjoy coming to the Nauti Mermaid when I would like something decent to eat right before going to a game or catching up with old friends.   The servers are fairly attentive however, you may need to try harder to grab someone's attention if they are slammed.  The quality of food is fairly consistant and you can not beat the quality and selection for the price."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the Nauti Mermaid. I had just moved to cleveland and was looking for some great seafood and drinks after moving in, and I was very pleasantly surprised. The place is deceptively large. From the outside, it looks like a small bar/restaurant, but as you walk through, there is plenty of seating and space. I liked the atmosphere, as it was casual and relaxed. The noise level can get a bit high, but I don't mind a louder place when it's a fir day night and busy. 

Now, for the food. I got the oysters and crab cake sandwich. Both were outstanding. If you are going to serve oysters, they have to be done right, and the Nauti Mermaid met all of my expectations. The crab cake sandwich was also good. Not the best I've had by any means, but for the price, it was an excellent choice. Clearly, they know how to do seafood, and with a name like theirs, they have to. 

The reason I give this a four star review is overall, I was very happy with my meal and the atmosphere of the restaurant. However, the crab cake wasn't anything to write home about and the noise level can definitely be a bit too much for most crowds. The service was also very slow. I know it was a busy Friday, but getting a bottled beer shouldn't take 25 minutes!!"}
{"text":"I only gave this place 4 stars because we didn't eat, we just drank...a lot. Needless to say, they aren't stingy with their pours. The environment was completely relaxed, it has a total dive bar atmosphere (pun intended) and everyone in the placed seemed really chill. Josh was our bartender and couldn't have been cooler. 

We'll definitely be back to have drinks and hopefully food next time. I had a staring contest with one of the lobsters in the front window...Pinchy Beware!!"}
{"text":"The food was not good at all. The seafood was old, it tasted like it had been frozen for years. There was sooooo much oil in my soup that I used two napkins to drain. I told my waitress the soup was oily, she said her manager would make her pay for it if I sent it back? The only bright spot was the key lime pie! It was delicious. I'll never go here again unless it's pie to go."}
{"text":"I see other reviews about the wait and the service, but I came on a Thursday and had no wait and quick food and drink. I guess if you show up to a downtown restaurant on a busy night and without a reservation, you should expect that. I, personally, have no complaints. We only had beer and lobster nachos (Yes, you read that right.), but both were well-priced, fresh, and served quick. Loved the unassuming ambiance. Will be back"}
{"text":"For brunch: Service friendly. Perks end there. Slower than slow. Both our orders were wrong. Omelettes were barely warm; eggs overcooked. Couldn't even finish the food. Seemed pointless to even try to explain all of this to the server. Gave up and got out as quick as we could. Which wasn't quick, because again, the service."}
{"text":"A friendly neighborhood bar/seafood restaurant located in the Warehouse District, Downtown Cleveland. I had not been to this spot for some time due to working assignments and finally stopped in recently for drinks and a light lunch. I remembered Josh, the bartender from when I frequented the bar in the past and we chatted about old times and the restaurant's acquisition of the space next door to expand its seating. The bar's claim to fame is it's fresh seafood, but this day I opted for a Mango & Walnut salad which was perfect for my hunger pangs. The bar has ten craft beers on tap and a decent wine list as well. If you are looking for a friendly spot downtown to get to know the locals in a relatively quiet atmosphere, I would suggest a trip to the Nauti Mermaid. Cheers!"}
{"text":"The Nauti's Happy Hour is on point.  As a matter of fact that's the only thing I am qualified to review because even though I have been here a few times, I was on a specific mission: Pumking on tap for $3 at Happy Hour is a rare pearl indeed. Such a great beer, such a great price. And half a dozen Blue Points for $5 didn't hurt the Happy Hour cause either. They were fresh and delicious. The staff is also laid back yet eager to please. Win.win.win."}
{"text":"I can't comment about the food because I have yet to eat here, but they have a great happy hour. There's always some good draft beers available and they offer a good selection of bottles. They have a fun cocktail menu too. Happy hour is until 7 Monday- Friday."}
{"text":"One word. AWESOME. From start to finish a great experience. We came for brunch before an afternoon Indians game. Service was great. Felt like they knew me. Made me feel at home. 

Coffee rivaled a fresh brew from Starbucks (next door). We both had the Crab Cake Benidic  The also offer A Lobster version that sounds delicious as well. Food was PERFECT. A meal I would have expected from a expensive seafood place at twice the price. 

Sunday brunch here is a hidden treasure. Highly recommended by both of us!"}
{"text":"The Nauti Mermaid is a fun Warehouse District bar.  They have a great happy hour -- $5 signature drinks and beer specials along with $5 crab cakes, beef sliders, wings, quesadillas, and other food specials.  We usually go on Wednesdays when they have a $1 oyster special.  While I'm not a fan of oysters, my husband could eat them all day and tells me they're delicious at the Nauti Mermaid.  While I appreciate the good food and drink specials, the restaurant seems a little dirty and that always drops a place down a star of two in my book."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place! My husband and I are from the Detroit area and are in town for a little get away. When I found this place I could wait to go for dinner. Tonight is New Year's Day night..so I was happy they were even open. We arrived just a bit after 7 and there were 2 other tables there as well...pretty dead for a Fri night I thought. We ordered the claim dip for an appetizer. I had Th rum runner cocktail and my husband just a Diet Coke. After what seemed like 15 min or so we hadn't gotten none of the above, so I asked and our waitress Chelsea said my drink was being made and the app would be done shortly. Mean while the husbands Diet Coke came and was completely flat. He tells Chelsea and she goes to get another. Still flat. Chelsea comes back once more informs us that they aren't sure what's wrong with the pop, but he could get a beer. My husband cannot drink because of medicine he takes, so he settles on a water. By this time my drink and our app has arrived. The hot claim dip was good...though I'm not sure $14 good. It was served with pita bread. To me it seemed a bit watery. I ordered the shrimp and chips and Th husband got the nauti pasta for our dinner. While waiting for our dinner we got to sit and watch Chelsea our waitress stand and stuff her face. Maybe the staff should eat in a break room? It just was odd. The bar tender sat and played n his phone. The restaurant was dead. By now there is only 1 other table, but looks are everything and watching your waitress stuff her face just looks bad. My husband loved his dish. There were big chunks of shrimp and lobster in the sauce. My shrimp and chips were ok. The  breaking was weird. It was very hard and want hurting the inside of my mouth as I ate it, so I ended up picking all the breaking off. They were huge though! The fries were your average bar fries. Nothing to write home about.mi also had the deep fried corn. Again..nothing special. Even though this is kinda like a dive bar, the prices are on the higher end. We walked out with a $90 bill. Not sure the food was worth that, though I would try again if I'm ever in the area again. I did buy a shirt!"}
{"text":"Unpretentious oyster bar.  Happy hour $1 oysters, not just one variety, mixed plate of what they have.  Exceptionaly fresh.  Rockn' tunes, if you're a child of 90s rock."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for breakfast this weekend. It was shortly after they opened so there weren't many other customers there yet. We found parking in the street right in front. 
Service was excellent but kind of on the slow side, very laid back. Food was okay. I wasn't really a big fan of any of the 3 dishes we got but none of them were awful either. Lobster was fresh, French fries were well seasoned and delicious. Ask to try some of their house made hot sauce, that was really good. Bloody Mary's were amazing as well."}
{"text":"For those who live and work in the Warehouse District, know that this place is the place to be! Whether you're coming for Sunday brunch, happy hour or a Saturday night out in CLE, Nauti Mermaid can be homebase. If you love seafood, you definitely need to try different items on their menu. My personal favorites are their crab cakes, eggs & legs (brunch menu), and lobster nachos. Fantastic drink specials, outta this world bloody mary's and my favorite item they serve - vodka absorbed gummy bear shots!"}
{"text":"Im assuming when my family and I went to this restaurant, it wasn't a great day to visit. Almost everyone at my table ordered king crab legs and the first batch that arrived came out super cold, the table told the waiter and the manager came out with another batch but this second batch was extremely over cooked.. which was upsetting because we already had to wait a long time for the food to come out. However, the manager came out and said the cooks had called off so he was in the back cooking and basically didn't know what he was doing lol, they took money off of our bill and gave everyone who ordered crab legs a 100% discount! I had high hopes for this place but my one experience ruined the whole thing, considering it is kind of pricey.. I expected more."}
{"text":"Blue point oysters 6 for $5 (thank you happy hour) : tastes fresh and a bit sandy 
Nauti Burger w/ side of fries: yuuuum
Exterior/interior design looks amazing, sets the vibe. Service was great, my water was never empty. 

I was craving for oysters for about a week or two now and decided to try it out here and I was not disappointed! I didn't really know what to order so I played it safe and ordered a burger and fries which came out at a reasonable price. Hope to come back soon.

Tip: Wednesday's 7-10pm $0.65 per oyster"}
{"text":"I like these kinds of places. Unpretentious. Hidden. Divey yet bold. 

The atmosphere in my opinion is great. Chill music, old style wooden bar, ships and seafood reminders everywhere. 

Beer selection is above par for all of W. 6th in my opinion. This is a good thing. We've been needing this on that street. Too many clubs. Uck. 

I thought the food was fairly good. I know its under new management and I hear that there will be many changes as the place settles. I do hope Hushpuppies make it back on the menu as the waitress said they were taken away because they didn't taste good. She assured me they would be added once the chefs find a good one to serve us. At least they're concerned about the quality of my food and not just serving it because they are getting requests. Would definitely rather you serve me the best or nothing at all. 

I ordered the Fish Tacos which were okay. I also tried the Surf and Turf burger which was freakin' delish. Surprisingly for a seafood restaurant the burgers are large, tasty and in charge. I also had some Oysters which were okay. They were stacked on top of each other and therefor had mud in the lower ones. Not a smart move by the cooks. IF you're going to serve oysters serve them correctly. Again -- I know its settling and will hope it gets better. Otherwise I'll be adding my two cents to the suggestion box. They were good. Not necessarily great but definitely good. 

A very cool place to drink with friends, eat some dinner, party a bit. I had a good time and will definitely be going back to keep trying more on the menu and enjoying the wonderful atmosphere. 

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Very clever name. Horrible smelling bathroom. My bartender clearly over poured my Anger Balls drinks however I'm not upset about it."}
{"text":"Bar was good. Will go back while we're visiting nice
Atmosphere. Bathroom needs work. One toilet broken..."}
{"text":"I really want to give them 5 stars, because if you talk to me in person about The Nauti Mermaid I would probably kidnap you to take you there because I am obsessed!! But in reality - I love their prices and their servers. 

Hands down the best happy hour in Cleveland.  I am a Miller girl - yeah yeah I know.  But for happy hour their beers are $1.  That's right ONE DOLLAR! It doesn't stop there - they have happy hour appetizers that are perfect for a Friday after work on the patio! Their blackened shrimp quesadilla - which is only $5!  It is really good - but it is a very average shrimp quesadilla.  I think it tastes 'SO' good usually because the work week is over, I'm outside drinking a beer and the weekend is the only thing ahead. 

I have never had a bad meal there - but I come for drinks and the fun and then just more or less stay for the food.  I have had a dinner there - okay, not great and I have also had brunch there again - good not great.  I would highly suggest checking it out because you won't leave unhappy and maybe you will just become a groopie like me and the rest of my friends."}
{"text":"Great food at an even greater price during their happy hour! Ann is great and makes a welcoming environment. Wings were awesome and sitting on the porch was cool too!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch on Friday , the lovely bartender was a smiling girl with a welcoming attitiude ,drinks were great and the seafood was really good and served quickly ....
Went for drinks yesterday night and it was also good ..."}
{"text":"I had really high hopes for this place based on some of the reviews as I was looking for a decent seafood place with reasonable prices.  I ordered the grouper and it was OK but certainly not memorable.  Similarly, the house salad was typical diner fare.  Value for the price was good, all things considered.  Place has a divey but friendly feeling with seating outdoors as well."}
{"text":"Whatever bartender that was working 11/25 at night big guy he was an ASSHOLE. I simply walked in there from a neighboring bar asking if they had change and he said \"I'm not a fucking atm\" in front of everyone at the bar. I could not believe how rude he was. Then I sent a co worker to get change, not knowing he went back to the Nauti Mermaid and they stole $20 from us and refused to give the rest. I will make sure no one I know goes here. How unprofessional. Get a new job if you don't like your current one."}
{"text":"Can't comment on the food but the drinks were good! Highly recommend the Milky Way! It is small and cramped. We were there on a Thursday night and couldn't find a spot at the bar so we sat in a booth. Still felt cramped and crowded and I imagine it gets really packed on the weekends. Reasonably priced and a fun little place to go if you are out walking around and want a drink."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend on a weekday so don't expect a crowd but great attentive service. It's a dive bar but there's some really great food you can get here. On certain days they have oyster specials so have to come back to try that. I tried their fish tacos which was delicious for my palate! Fish didn't taste like rubber and really had a kick in the mouth cuz it was sort of spicy. My friend and I split their mussels and there were plenty to share. 

We sat by the bar area but they have booths in the front and I think on certain days, they have a live band as well. Definitely a go to place if you live in the area to grab a bite!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for Happy Hour. Small bar vibe, seemed to be all locals or friends of the employees. First negative was the bar tender didn't know how to make a drink that is well known & has been around for years in every bar I've EVER been to. 

Service was quick, waitress was pleasant. Ordered a few happy hour specials, the Conch ceviche was like dirty dishwater & tasted just as appetizing. Next up was the happy hour oysters, they were very tiny & the 2nd one I tried to eat tasted seriously bad so I had to spit it out. Too afraid to eat anymore. 
Shrimp appetizer was ok but overdone & cocktail sauce had a weird flavor. HOW do u mess up making cocktail sauce, geez! 

One of the entree's was a fried fish. It was FULL of bones & hubby left half of the food on the plate. One of the sides, he didn't touch because it was too hot to eat. It must have been made with the same Habanero sauce that i will mention next. He will eat everything & doesn't waste anything normally. 

And the final negative was, there were 3 sauces on the oyster plate. Waitress neglected to tell us that 1 sauce was the Habanero sauce from he**!  So after a tiny taste of that sauce on an oyster, All my taste buds were burned off! My throat burned from that crap for about an hour. Would have been nice if the server would have explained the sauces, especially since tourists might not be familiar with their menu items! 

Sorry but this place failed on all fronts, pass & try another place in the area maybe!"}
{"text":"Josh is an amazing server! We enjoyed the amazing happy hour specials and the food was incredible! Everyone was very welcoming and we came back 2 nights in a row. We are from out of town this is our new favorite place in Cleveland! We will be back, matey. ARRRRGH"}
{"text":"I went here with a friend and my wife.  It was relatively low key for a Monday night as it's a bar restaurant.  We picked this place because it had a restaurants.com gift certificate available.

We started off with spicy fish tacos which were very delicious - probably the best part of our meal.  We ordered a walleye platter, lobster BLT, and an oyster poboy.  I got to try each thing we ordered and they were all very good and a lot better than I expected from a 3.5 rated place on yelp.  Onion rings had a lot of pepper but were still really good. 

My wife complained that the female restroom stalls did not have working latches and that there were no paper towels, but just a blower with freezing cold air.

Overall, a pretty good place to eat."}
{"text":"Ordered a house salad with my meal which took 20 minutes n the bartender to inquire about. The place wasnt packed.  I ordered the shrimp n chips. They were suppose to be beer battered. They were encased in a suit of armor they call breading and the fries were burnt, not crunchy though which is a sign that they were sitting out for a bit.

To be fare my son order the nauti pasta which was pretty good."}
{"text":"Great service by Anne. Cute place but most of the food (except fish tacos) was not very good. Our group had several appetizers- crab cakes, fritters, fish tacos, jalapeño fish cheddar soup, and some fried perch with onion rings. Fritters had no flavor, crab cakes, onion rings and fish were over fried! Maybe the fryers are too hot or grease too old. Soup was too spicy and not very flavorful. 

BUT, the fish tacos were excellent- 4 stars on those. Recommend they change their menu around the fish tacos, everything else was lacking."}
{"text":"Friend and I ordered the sliders and the pretzel bun crab sandwich.  Delivery took an hour, but the food was definitely worth it.  Wished I had tipped more"}
{"text":"Only one server working. Waited 10 minutes for her to bring me a menu. Others around me had been waiting longer. I had come in for the lobster special, but they had sold out and no other specials. Items on the menu seemed really overpriced for the atmosphere. I wasn't impressed and left. Lots of places to eat in Cleveland, this will not be one of them."}
{"text":"No wonder the oysters are cheap. They are terrible!  No flavor, full of dirt, fall apart and they don't even shuck them off the shell.  Only thing worse was the condescending bartender and manager who wouldn't replace the returned food.
Will gladly play full price next door at Johnnys or Blue Point."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night with some coworkers for drinks only. The place is definitely a bar look/vibe but apparently the food is good. They had cool drink options (that were super tasty) and priced typical to expensive drinks in Cleveland. The nautical theme and decor is pretty cool but outdated and a bit dirty. The lobsters in the tank looked kinda somber lol The bathrooms are questionable like any old bar...we didn't mind too much though as we aren't a picky crowd. I would come back for a drink before dinner elsewhere or maybe even dinner here if I had something else going on in the area but I wouldn't venture downtown to come here and only here. Especially because the service was sporadic and we had a hard time getting our checks. I think once they found out we weren't eating they weren't as interested in us. However, what seemed to be the manager came and checked on how we were doing at one point which was nice!"}
{"text":"This place rocks.  Ann was very friendly and gave us great service. The food was outstanding."}
{"text":"I heard about this place from the hostess in the executive lounge in my hotel. She was right the drinks were great and the food was good as well. The lobster dip is to die for!"}

{"text":"Really good seafood bar and grill. I got the jalapeño cream with lobster soup and it was really good. I would have preferred a little less jalapeño but good none the less. I also got the lobster BLT which was also really good. It comes with a side (I got a dinner salad, which again was really good). There are a lot of different options in downtown Cleveland and I don't get down here enough so I don't know when I'll get back here, but I don't think you will go wrong here."}
{"text":"Austin Walkin Cane put up a mean performance tonight! Our server was super-friendly and accommodating, given today's finicky tastes. Definitely should try the jerk Seared tuna sandwich. Crabcakes, ceviche, and conch looked ultra-tempting going out to the neighboring tables. Boutique wines availed themselves, making decision-making  a treat! Kudos!"}
{"text":"Not terrible but definitely won't go back. I ordered the Maui Maui sandwich with mashed potatoes. The waitress said the mashed potatoes were made in house but they came out of a bag. I know this because our table was right by the kitchen. They were cold when I got them and the portion was so small it was laughable. The Maui was actually very good. My boyfriend loved his fish tacos. My friend despised her fried calamari and couldn't finish it. I was still very hungry after eating my small entree but the waitress didn't come back for quite some time. I wanted to order fries but she told me the kitchen closed 6 minutes prior. How convenient. Also when we arrived, there were crab legs on the counter of the kitchen. Ready to serve. No heat lamp. We watched them get served about 30 mins later. We couldn't remember seeing crab legs on the menu. But someone probably got sick that night."}
{"text":"Pretty solid place for oysters on the cheap. After 7pm on Wednesdays, oysters are just $0.65 each! A group of us usually come here before 7 to catch happy hour for appetizers such as crab cakes and mussels. Followed by a few dozen oysters for dinner. The crab cakes are have pretty good flavor and their sauce tartar sauce is pretty creamy. The mussels are somewhat OK, the mussels are good, but the broth is usually a bit off. Two of the three times, the broth had way too much wine. My friends and I have probably gone through at least 15 dozen oysters here and we've only encountered one bad one... Sizes vary depending on the season but they are fresh and succulent. The oysters are complimented by cocktail sauce, horseradish, and a super spicy habanero sauce. I usually put a bit of everything into each oyster before devouring it. The last few times here, we were served by a very energetic waitress. She was attentive and seem pretty cool."}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere if you just want something casual and a fun place to catch the game on TV.  Try the  Fish Tacos."}
{"text":"I was VERY disappointed with this place. I had never been, but it's been around for a while so it's obviously gone down the drain recently or it wouldn't be in business today. Since there was an advertisement for almost every position posted in the bathroom, I suspect the place has recently changed management - or has none at all, since after asking to see a manager he (or she, no one seemed to know) refused to come out to talk with us about our experience. 

I came in with a small group for happy hour on a Wednesday with the intention of sticking around for $0.65 oysters. We arrived around 6:30pm and our waitress initially seemed friendly and competent. Well, after waiting a good 20 minutes for a couple of beers, we were wondering what the rest of the night was going to bring. We ordered several happy hour appetizers. We ordered, and we waited..and WAITED... until finally the food came out and most of it was pretty average. The quesadillas and crab cakes were good, shrimp and oysters not as good, but the mussels were clearly spoiled and reeked a terrible smell at our table. We had to ask the bar tender to go find our waitress, as she had not come back to our table in almost a half an hour after the food was served.  Never came back to fill up water or ask if we needed anything. She was nowhere to be seen most of the time we were dining here. 

Getting back to the mussels, I posted a photo of what we were served. Rotten, broken shells, dried up mussels in a purple water. I'm not sure what was served to us, but we sent it back to the kitchen. 

Two of my dining companions decided it was time to ask to speak to a manager about the service and some of the food.  Apparently they either have no manager, or \"he\" or \"she\" (referred to by two different employees) refuses to talk to customers.  He/she would not come out to our table and the bar tender said she was \"busy\". Way to go, Nauti Mermaid.  

I would never come back, and would advise you to stay away."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with their Happy Hour! $5 appetizers like crab cakes (a little small but delicious! Get two orders if you're still hungry), shrimp quesedilla (heavy on the shrimp and the queso!!), and my favorite - sliders (3 big little burgers). Drink specials too but I'm telling you, the $5 apps are what make this place worth it. And the service too, very attentive and welcoming. \"It's Happy Hour!\" was our greeting and a happy hour it was"}
{"text":"So I just left Nauti Mermaid,food was ok. I ordered 2 main lobsters a bed bug started running off my plate. I ran to get my Server Mike,he said he was going to try and figure something out,he ran and whispered to a customer. The customer started to stare. I ran to another server her name was Sarah,explained the situation and showed her the critter. She said oh no,this not suppose to happen. So I seen a guy with a suit and I asked her who was he because he walked to the back towards the kitchen ,I asked we go was he because he wouldn't stop looking. Sarah said we do t have a manager but this is Gus cell phone number,call him,he out sick. 440-320-6549. I called the number 3 times and a female told me to please stop calling she don't know Gus. Sarah tell me that this is Gus number and that is his wife answering playing games..I was so upset I couldn't take my food home because I was very scared. The way I was treated was very poor and I will be calling the Health Department,the news department and whomever else I can contact. This was very unprofessional"}
{"text":"Tuesday 6 to 8 they have live music which was good. Service was great. Happy hour (4-7) deals are reasonable. $5 apps & drink specials. Ordered mussels provencale ($5 hh special) If you don't like vinegar, don't order this. I do so I enjoyed it but my boyfriend didn't care for it. Also ordered beef nachos (not on hh) which were loaded & tasty. My entree (salad or soup incl); mahi with brussels & rice ($17) The fish was a tad dry, but good. I have had better @ a non seafood spot though... brussels were flavorful & rice I didnt care for at all. Just not my taste. Boyfriend's entree (salad or soup incl); seafood pasta (menu said $24, charged $20?) Choice of marinara or alfredo. He choose alfredo. He said it was a pretty good dish, but didn't care for the andouille sausage in it. Drink; I ordered key west lemonade ($5 hh special) it tasted like a long island spot on..  I ordered a 2nd lol"}
{"text":"My FAVORITE dive! I live in Columbus now but look forward to coming home to Cle every time to grab a drink, some conch fritters, and a bottle of the housemade habanero hot sauce to go. Seriously I take this hot sauce on every trip or to every cookout, and my friends specially request orders to be brought back to Columbus. It's VERY hot, but amazing flavor. Typically served in a thimble-size cup with the oysters, but it's too good not to request with any of the seafood. Brunch menu is good, but I'd suggest stopping on the patio for dinner. It's a hidden gem on W. 6th, and if you need a chill break from Brownies craziness or the drunk bachelor parties, stop in. Unique Keys-style seafood. I haven't found anywhere else in the state (other than Put-in-Bay) to offer good ceviche or conch - but don't worry, obviously you less exotic Believelanders can get your daily dose of local perch and walleye. CASUAL CASUAL CASUAL. Omg I love this place :) Makes me miss home... and Key West!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this maritime themed funky place.  Great service by Ann with plenty of recommendations for drinks, food, Etsy.  She was upbeat and thorough.  Food was delicious and generous.  Prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"It's really the insanely cheap happy hour specials and the cool vibe of Nauti Mermaid that keep me coming back. If it were dependent on their food, they'd be in trouble. 

Although I'm not a big seafood eater, I've gone to hang out at Nauti to grab some drinks and ended up hungry. I mean, who can argue with $1 domestic drafts? I know I can't. So, we have perused the menu, tried food and have been disappointed. I've found that just about the best thing on the menu is the nachos, sans seafood. Other than that, I'd steer clear of the munchies there. 

What's great about Nauti is that it's a hideaway for those wandering the Warehouse District for a place that isn't a club or a fancy restaurant. You can chill out with a cold beer and feel like you're inside of a ship. It's actually really fun! Plus the beer list rocks, but not just with bottle choices. The drafts are great unique and great too! If you're looking for something fun to do during the warm months in Cleveland, try sitting out on Nauti's patio on a weekend. Phenomenal entertainment consisting of people making fools of themselves on W. 6th. 

Yea, so head over to Nauti if you're looking for a chill vibe and spectacularly cheap happy hour prices. For food? Eh...I'd go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I went here with my friend for her bachelorette party dinner., ordered the steak with lobster. It comes with a side salad n mashed potatoes which is a $42 plate. They made my steak 3 times and they still couldn't get it right.. Ontop of waiting 45 mins for my food. The steak was burnt n tasted like charcoal horribly. My mashed potatoes were cold. Ugh! For that much $ it was not worth it. Service was great tho !"}
{"text":"Listen. The food is great but something has happened recently. The service is taking entirely too long. I have never been here when the service was this slow. We waited for seats and seats were open. We waited to get our drink order. We've been here about 1.5. and we just got our food. Food is good enough to come back but etc on the service."}

The shortbus riders that I work with had no complaints, elsewise they'd be banging their helmets together and the drool would be flying!!!!"}

Food is great, fanstastic beer list, and they offer outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Not what i expected. So much better. From entering the door. The Walleye.....the best. Sevice..for a Tuesday...great. Im a server. Loved it all."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the kitschy atmosphere and the seafood. The service was good and the food was tasty (maybe a bit overpriced). This seems to be one of the few casual places in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"As a bar, it is just your average dive type bar. Nothing too bad, nothing too good. Just, eh, it will do. 

As an eatery, the Nauti Mermaid falls way behind. 

A friend and I ate here a little over a month ago, using a Living Social deal to do so. As has been the case with other places where I've first been there because of Living Social or Groupon -- if it hadn't been for being able to eat there for essentially half price, I would have actually been frustrated. 

We started with an order of Nauti Sliders to serve as a big appetizer as we were both starving. Decent, though the blue cheese was a bit overpowering - my companion mentioned it first, and he is usually fond of blue burgers. Not terrible though, just average. 

He ordered the New York Strip Steak, I ordered the Walleye Platter. I tasted everything he had, in addition to eating my own stuff... so I can criticize the whole meal (for the most part). 

His: The steak was overdone and under seasoned (pretty much unseasoned really), the mashed potatoes were very whipped (he was convinced they were potato flake based, but I'm pretty sure they were just really, really whipped), and similarly unseasoned. (They were ok with some butter and salt and pepper.) I have no recollection of the veggies on his plate at all. (I'm not sure if they were missing or if they were just that unremarkable.) 

Mine: For sides I had the black beans and the deep fried corn on the cob. (The latter at the server's suggestion.) The corn was pretty good -- I don't think anything special really was done to it other than deep frying it (no seasoning), and there was a LOT of silk left in the corn. (Nice to know it's somewhat fresh I guess, but was kind of hard to eat.) Tasty nonetheless once buttered and salted. The black beans were pretty tasty - admittedly. Southern Style to them means adding pork of some kind (I do believe it was pork belly, but I couldn't be sure) and it definitely was good. But the walleye? Ugh. Greasy. I mean, look, it's breaded and fried fish, I expect some grease. This was mushy and weird and really, really greasy. The piece of fish I got was huge, so that was good, but the greasy bit... well it kind of ruined it for me. I'm pretty sure I left more than half of it behind... not because I was full. (This is how I ended up tasting his whipped potatoes... I was still kind of hungry.) 

All in all, the food wasn't terrible. But the bill would have been $50 (not counting drinks) had I not had my Living Social deal. Did we get $50 worth of yummy out of that? No, no, definitely not. The food at Nauti Mermaid reminds me a little of some of the lower quality fish camps back home (even the best of those isn't really high quality...) at about 3 times the price. 

The service was OK. Not over the top fantastic, but our server was friendly and prompt for the most part. 

The atmosphere -- for a dive bar, it would have been fine. Going there to eat dinner (this was about 7 or 7:30 on a Friday) wasn't so great. There was a live musician (playing the standard set of guy with a guitar covers more or less, with a couple of decent songs) but as much as I love live music, it was too loud for a dinner spot, and just seemed a bit early to be driving us out for the bar crowd. 

Overall: Pass. Too many other dive bars to go to that are equal or a little better. Definitely a thousand better places to eat."}
{"text":"Worst food and service ever.   The mussels came out in a weird purple - ish watery broth that was really salty.   The mussels themselves were rubbery and cold.  I'm not sure how the oysters were because we never got them (we waited for 1 hr).  The drinks took forever.  When we had the audacity to try to cancel our order because it had been 1hr, the waitress tried to give us some ridiculous story about how the food took a long time because she was not allowed to ring in the courses at the same time.   As a former food service worker I can verify that this is false.   Will never go back and I suggest that no one else make the mistake of coming here."}
{"text":"MY wife and two friends were here 1-28-2016. The restaurant was very inviting, from the beginning we were greeted by our waitress  Anne, she was very pleasant and knowable about all menu items her descriptions made our mouths water, we started with beer from their large selection of main stream to craft. Menu items we choose included lobster nachos, crabs cakes and mango walnut salad. this was a wonderful dinning experience. would recommend  this stop any time you visit the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"You have to try the $1.50 fish tacos on Thursday.  New ownership and some new additions on the menu but these are fantastic.  Cara L. is right about the cheap drink specials.  We go here so often after work I refuse to check in via Yelp because you all might check me into AA.  This place is dark and cozy.  With all the clubs and DB's lining up and down west 6th, this place is great."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I am not very well acquainted with Cleveland food, but we almost always come here (or tailgate) on Sunday before Browns games. I dunno, I just like the vibe here and the crab cakes are really solid. Some of the other dishes were letdowns. My friend let me try the jalapeño and lobster cream and neither of us cared for it. I also had fish tacos and lobster nachos and they felt uninspired (though, should add: tons of lobster on the nachos). I'm used to Akron/Cuyahoga Falls prices, but I do find some items to be a little expensive, but I get it. Love the location and service is always pretty decent. Seems like the servers all have a good sense of humor on the piss/vinegar side of the spectrum."}
{"text":"Went for dinner here based on Yelp reviews. Ellen was very friendly, helpful and attentive. Happy Hour specials can't be beat. Steamed shrimp was seasoned well and the crab cakes were tasty. The lobster nachos were excellent. Because this was Wednesday night 69-cent oysters, I had to give them a try. If you are into spicy, the habanero sauce is an absolute must with the raw oysters. Will definitely return when in town to try the lake perch and chips, as well as other items!"}
{"text":"Passing through Cleveland and the place we picked was closed. Raining and saw this place. Looked in and it seemed welcoming and friendly. It is.

We ate at the bar and the bartender was great. We wanted local fish and he discussed the varieties. We asked about the menu items and he was candid about them. I took his recommendations and was delighted. He also recommended a complementary beer and it was fine. I had the lake perch and it was excellent. My wife had an oyster sandwich and like my perch better."}
{"text":"Wow, 75 cent oysters every Wednesday from 7-10! What a steal. Too bad these oysters aren't as fresh as their deals! Great if you just want to get your craving on."}
{"text":"- The service sucks big time
 - waitress has loads of attitude
 - the food was served after 50 minutes, when questioned it was like - \"we are full sweety, the kitchen is overloaded, you need to wait for your grub, this is the best we can do\"
 - the lobster roll did not have lobster..."}
{"text":"Been to this place many times for beers but never had the food until last week.  My woman and I stopped in to try something new other then the usual downtown bar food, we were very happy that we did.  The surf and turf burger that we both ordered was fantastic, a half pound burger cooked perfectly and topped with a crispy crab cake.  The hand cut fries were awesome and the bill was surprisingly small for the amount of food, will definitely be back to try some more food."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! EVERYTHING is homemade, including their jalapeño cream lobster soup - YUM. Also try their habanero mayo. It goes well on everything. Great prices and people, too!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure the theme really fits on West 6th but at least it's something different. There was live music when I was there which is always a plus. 

Unfortunately the incredibly slow and rude bartenders soured me within my first five minutes of arriving. In their defense it was happy hour. However, a bar that can't handle service when people are in your establishment points to apathy or lack of proper training.  This kind of blatant disregard for customers will make it difficult for me to ever consider returning."}
{"text":"Captures the Florida feel in a Jimmy Buffet way.  Excellent draft beers.  We had a 'breakfast' stout at 10% and a porter.  Good service.  Great food.  We had the mahi mahi tuna sandwich and a portobello mushroom sandwich which come with a side.  Live music.  We sat in a booth."}
{"text":"Hugr fan of the Nauti Mermaid. Everything Ive had on the menu has been great (hot crab dip, wings, peel n eat shrimp, nauti burger, jerk chicken and fish n chips). Has a great dive bar feel and makes you feel like you've taken a trip to Key West."}
{"text":"What  great local pub. Did not try the food - just had a couple of local brewed beers and spent time with the locals and cool bartender. The Wharehouse district is a \"happening\" place. Bet its crazy with the big sports teams in town..."}
{"text":"Oh yea.   A little rough around the edges.  Great Happy hour,  oysters were awesome .   Diner was surf and turf burger.  Half pound burger topped with a huge crab cake : )))"}
{"text":"a solid 3 1/2 with a round up to four because I LOVE COMING HERE ON WEDNESDAY!!! 65 cent oysters absolutely can't be beat.  I usually get the calamari appetizer too, which all together creates the crunch i'm looking for as well as a mix of salty, savory, lemon, and seafood all together in one tasty meal!  The service here is pretty sub par.  It takes forever for drinks of any kind to be refilled-maybe its just a little too relaxed of a bar for me.  The food is good though and with happy hour specials like crab cakes and daily specials like oysters, the prices can't be beat.  I may or may not have ordered 2 dozen one time and the waitress looked at me like I was crazy.  The cool vibe and great specials make this a place I would come back to during happy hour, other times I might pick somewhere else to relax."}
{"text":"Good guys. Good music. People are good. The live music makes it a good spot. meh on seafood but you don't go there for caviar. Good happy hours."}
{"text":"Right in downtown Cleveland, the Nauti mermaid was a great place to hit a cheap happy hour with a colleague while I was in town on business. 
The risque name led a few coworkers to raise their eyebrows when I told them where I was headed for work, but that just added to the fun...especially considering the place is simply a cute bar downtown and has nothing to cause you to blush, as the name might suggest. 
Like I said, I grabbed happy hour with a colleague after work and it was a great spot for two-20 something ladies to relax with some yummy seafood at a great price. The drinks were strong and the apps were cheap. They have crazy deals on cocktail shrimp, crab cakes, and cocktails which all hit the spot. The crab cakes were yum! with a great sauce to accompany. It is not a fancy place, but they were great...especially for the price. 
The service was ok...our waitress did the job, but could have been a bit more friendly. Also, when my friend asked for some butter to dip her shrimp in, she put it in the ice that the shrimp came in...causing the melted butter to cool too much to use. When she asked for some fresh melted butter I felt a bit of 'tude coming from her. 
There was a local musician, which I am usually a fan of, but the place is small so it made it a bit loud for happy hour. I was looking for a place to chit chat and talk about guys with my work girlfriend, and instead we had to yell across the table...a little annoying. 
I forgot about being annoyed when a hot group of men from a local construction site came in for after-work drinks. Problems seem to disappear when a group of manly men in good fitting jeans and work boots enter the scene. I should find out if they go in after work regularly...I would return for the crab cakes and the hot scenery.There is also great outdoor seating. Gotta love a nice outdoor table in the summertime. Maybe I caught the waitress on an off night...she just doesn't need to give 'tude. Cheer up, girl! Fake it 'til you make it, girl.
Check them out...even if I lived in Cleveland, I don't think I'd be a regular here, but I would go from time to time when I was in the mood for a great deal and good drinks at happy hour."}
{"text":"Absolutely abysmal. Came here to try the Wednesday happy hour after hearing it was a big deal. Horrible food and very slow service, even though the place wasn't packed. The only highlight were the sliders, which were actually pretty good. The shrimp were overseasoned but the real letdown were the oysters. I can understand why they only charge 65 cents an oyster, and now I wonder why anyone would pay that for them. The oysters were the worst I've ever had:  flavorless, dirty, no brine, not fresh, and poorly shucked. Next time go to Blue Point: exponentially better food for a marginal cost more."}
{"text":"This place has great reviews so it leads me to believe that it was just a bad day for all of the staff, but this will be our last visit to this place. Our group has been going there on Sunday afternoons after an event we do together for the past four years and never had a problem. The food is awesome but service is below zero. The restaurant was dead except for a few tables in the bar area taken up and we had the bigger room to ourselves. We had a party of around 16 people and they sat us without hassle. The waitress did not smile or greet us when she took our orders she just got through everyone as quickly as possible. Food took over an hour to be served and it was because the waitress did not put the food in for at least half an hour. We learned at the end of our meal that the bar \"really appreciate reservations for big parties (even though they were empty) and because of you the restaurant ran out of food. So thanks for that, everyone, now you guys know for next time.\" She tossed up her hands and walked away. The bartender was confrontational as well and took several minutes to walk up to me. The first thing he says is \"do we have a problem here?\" before I could even open my mouth. Sorry TNM, there won't be a next time with you guys ever."}
{"text":"I couldn't believe the wait on a burger. I went two times, walked out the first time after waiting 40 minutes. I was told they were melting the cheese and it would only be 5 more minutes....10 minutes later I left. I went back due to a persistent friend. The burger took about 30inutes this time and I wasnt overly impressed. The lobster bisque however was the bomb. Not sure I'll be headed back to nauti any time soon for food."}
{"text":"Calamari not recognizable. Lobster nachos okay.  Conch fritters not edible.  Full of fillers - no taste. Really!! This is a seafood restaurant!  Time to go back to school folks!"}
{"text":"I used to come here often for crab cakes when I worked downtown, but hadn't been in while. Went yesterday with my fiancé to explore the menu more, and boy oh boy should I have just stuck to what I knew. I ordered the fried walleye platter and while the fish was good, there was only one small piece. It came with two sides; I chose the Caribbean rice and a side salad. The rice was barely edible. It was balls of it stuck together. Not fluffy at all. The salad was forgotten about until I had to remind my server. Not sure why it's called a platter when I received a child's portion of fish and a small sad scoop of rice. If I do come back which is doubtful, it will only be for crab cakes. Hopefully those are still good.

We also shared a lobster roll as an appetizer and the bun was very doughy. The lobster mix inside of the roll had minced lobster; not the big chunks you'd expect for a lobster roll."}
{"text":"I liked this place enough to come out of a year-long yelp hibernation to let you know!  Now, Cleveland may not be the first place that comes to mind when you think \"quality, fresh and inventive seafood,\" but the Nauti Mermaid has a really interesting menu and the fish was delicious.  

The hub and I shared the sesame-grilled tuna sand mentioned above, as well as a plate of beer-battered cod.  I am a big fried-fish fan ever since my early flirtations with the Groton's fisherman, however the fried fingers of cod were pretty special here at the Nauti.  The breading was crispy and light and not overly greasy.  I also have to mention that they had salmon gyro on the menu.  I don't dig on cow, so this sounded like another interesting option.  On to the sides - you get your choice of a bunch of sides including fries, mashed red-skin potatoes, green beans and deep-fried corn.  We tried the first 3, which were all great, though the mash really took the cake, especially with the wasabi mayo on the tuna sandwich.  

Also, a nice selection of beers on tap.  I don't live in OH, but if I did I would return for sure.  The food here was great, and absent were the high prices and seemingly required dress codes (? - khakis and blue shirts?) of some of the other establishments along 6th street."}
{"text":"One star too many. I was with a party of five a few weeks ago and most of them have already posted reviews to sum up our experience so I'll try to keep it short. I have never walked out on a bill but with service AND food that terrible they nearly pushed me to the brink of doing so. The toilets in the men's bathroom were filled to the top with urine and would not flush. They had signs posted everywhere advertising they were hiring for all positions, which to me is a sign that something is not right with an establishment. All of the cocktails we ordered were TERRIBLE! I wouldn't trust there bartenders to do anything other than pop the top of a beer bottle. It took us nearly an hour just to get our bill, have it corrected 3 times (yes that is the number three) and pay. The staff didn't even seem to know who the manager was when asked and we were unable to even speak him or her. Avoid this place at all cost. I have no clue how they have stayed in business for so long, in downtown of places."}
{"text":"We went to check this place out after work on a friday looking for a nice chill place for happy hour & were not dissapointed.  We went at about 6:00 Friday, sat right at the bar & began drinking $1 bud light pints for a while.  I repeat, $1 bud light pints.  Just coming from Chicago, this was nearly impossible to believe.  The place was relatively quiet, the bar tender was nice & the beer was continually served when the previous glass was empty.  A couple of dart boards help provide entertainment if conversation goes stale, and the downtown location is great for other options when you leave the bar.  The only negative was the parking situation (which really shouldn't count against the bar), but street parking was unavaible & we had to pay for a lot (there was a cavs home game)."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch. I ordered the seafood Cobb. It was not good. The cilantro aioli was   homemade but just looked like mayo with cilantro leaves mixed in. The tuna was tasteless but the shrimp was nicely seasoned. The bloody mary was good and came with a piece of fried cod that was delicious."}
{"text":"This was a disappointing 360 degrees experience.  The service, the food.. we didn't drink, so we can't accurately review the bar... maybe that would have been the saving grace??

The soup of the day was clam chowder - not a clam chowder like any I've had before; it was less creamy and had a bit of a pepper kick.  It was still not a poor conception of a soup in my opinion, just a little odd.  However my fish tacos were all around poor.  The fish tasted like it had just been caught in Lake Erie - polluted, dirty water.  No exaggeration!  I love fish and fish that tastes fishy, but - this was beyond that level of tolerance.  They were bland, as was everything else we ordered.  The rib-eye, the burger... totally bland.  

Too bad this was our sole Cleveland meal!!  The visit to the Adult Mart saved our trip to Cleveland, though...."}
{"text":"Great $5 appetizers at happy hour!  Friendly waiter (Mike Rogers), great drinks and the owner(?) even came by to thank us for visiting."}
{"text":"Note: this review is based on UberEats. I had a friend over, and we had a really specific craving for lobster. Cue The Nauti Mermaid - saving the day with their lobster nachos and lobster roll.

I have to admit, when my friend said she wanted to order lobster nachos, I was skeptical. Most of the time, nachos can be a total let down or super skimpy on the ingredients. Not these babies! They were totally loaded with avocado, lettuce, queso, onion and relish and a generous portion of lobster. It was advertised as a \"snack\" but honestly could have been the whole dinner. 

We also split a lobster roll (I know, so much lobster). The bread was buttery and delicious, but the lobster on this roll needed more flavor. Overall though, our lobster craving was satisfied, and I would be totally down to come by and try their location on West 6th in the Warehouse District. They have a huge seafood menu!"}
{"text":"Cool little place on the outskirts of the Warehouse District. Good service, good selection of beers. I couldn't tell you about most of the seafood -- I usually wuss out and get the \"Nauti Burger,\" which has a whole fried egg on it. Their fish tacos are boss, though, and I think they have them on special on Thursday nights.

Only downside: Don't get so wasted that you fall down the approximately 80 feet of stairs that lead to the bathrooms on the lower level."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite happy hour places in Cleveland. The oysters are pretty cheap during hh (around 85 cents) but wednesdays after 7pm it's even cheaper! For 65 cents, it's a great deal! I think I've eaten 20-30 one time and only encounter one that wasn't fresh. The cocktails are a wonderful deal as well. I think I ordered the rum runner a couple of times and was very satisfied with it. I love the theme - like a dive bar right out of key west. I've been here on some of the coldest nights this last winter and it was a nice escape. The other hh food I've tried are typical bar food. The oysters and cheap drinks are enough to get me coming back =)"}
{"text":"I was actually on w. 6th on a Saturday nite.  Its been many years since that has happened.  Walked in and first thing I liked is that you couldnt tell you were on w. 6th.  Not your typical cheese dicks and coke-fiend chicks with Chicklet white teeth and red marks from the tanning bed...  The bartenders and servers were totally normal..which was a breath of fresh air.  This place always has great online deals ($20 for $10..etc.).   I got the crab cake burger.  It was cooked well but the crab tasted fishy and the cake was mushy.  They had Pumking on tap and they sell a BIG one which I liked..most placed serve it to ya in one of those lame snifter and still charge ya 7 bux for it.  F that..  Wana come back for the happy hr (which I hear is dope) and the lobster roll.  Food is OK, but better if ya get a good online deal first.  I would be bummed if I paid full price for the so-so seafood."}
{"text":"Stopped in for happy hour on a Tuesday and the place was nearly empty at 6 p.m.  Now I know why.   The peel and eat shrimp had no flavor.  The shrimp quesadilla was good, probably the best selection on the happy hour menu.  I wanted to try the oysters but with nobody else in the place eating oysters I decided not to try raw seafood in an empty bar.   The lobster nachos were the reason one of our group chose this place.  They were just so-so and at $16 not worth the money.  We also ordered the hot crab dip and it was the worst dip any of our party of 4 had ever eaten at a restaurant.  It tasted closer to a spicy tuna fish spread than crab.   The server took it off our bill which is the only reason I give this place 2 stars instead of 1.   There are certainly much better choices in the area."}
{"text":"We are mid-age experienced travelers and been around. Nothing worse than a restaurant struggling with 5-6 guests in the entire night. I usually get suspicious from quality and freshness of ingredients. I ordered the grouper, low quality pan fried with a dirty oil, horrible beans and old rice. My wife ordered a soup and a lobster; soup was old and very thick, clearly it shouldn't get out of the kitchen, when we complained they said \"let me get the chef to thin it down for you\" when we tried to get another soup the answer was \"that was the only soup we have tonight\" I told our waiter not to worry about the price and we will pay for it and they accepted the offer. Low potential dead Cleavland on a freezing night, few people have decided to go our and no potential to even open that restaurant at that night. I was watching the chef cooking all the time, he was checking the doness of a steak with a food thermometer, arranging with his fingers a fried calimari on a plate, although he dumped the order out of the fryer basket onto the plate, why would you touch it with your hands then? my wife's lobster was straightforward from the fish tank to the boiler to the plate, with bad mashed potato and steamed yellow zucchini, no taste or seasoning at all. Never again."}
{"text":"Ventured here on a night for a special on oysters!

The oysters were fulfilling, but coming from Blue Point, I thought they would be better. We got another order of the Steamed Mussels Provencale, which exceeded the oysters by a long shot. The mussels were in a red wine, garlic, tomato sauce that was absolutely divine. I'd go back to this place specifically for them.

The bar/restaurant itself is super cool, covered in a bunch of neon signs. The help was great. To be honest, my favorite thing about The Nauti Mermaid was the mini mermaid that sat atop my cocktail glass. I took it home with me, I thought it was so cool. I guess this shows how the little things excite me. 

The Nauti Mermaid is OK and if visiting at Happy Hour, worth the visit, but with so many other spots in the city, I'll probably try those first before hopping back in."}
{"text":"Lobster was great!!  actually the side grill corn was AMAZING."}
{"text":"When my visiting parents wanted to try a Cleveland seafood restaurant, I was a bit horrified. Not that Cleveland doesn't have excellent seafood restaurants, but that any not deemed \"too expensive\" by Midwestern sensibilities would just suck.

We went to the Nauti Mermaid expecting mediocrity at its finest--and on atmosphere and service, it delivered. The blaring mix of country songs and oldies was too much, the kitschy Key West decor was out of place, and that evening's clientele was a bit rough. The service was slow, and our waiter ogled me one too many times. (Eyes are up here, bro.) 

The saving grace was the food. My dad ranted about the clam chowder, claiming it was the best he's had in a long time. He loved the battered perch and onion rings, and my mom thought the mahi mahi sandwich was awesome--and loved the price even more. I had the seafood cobb with seared yellowfin tuna (hold the bleu cheese and croutons, light on the balsamic), and was really impressed by the quality of the fillet and the freshness of the shrimp and avocado. My parents said they'd definitely come back again, and I guess I can suffer the place for another bite, too."}
{"text":"Great happy hour specials. I had very fresh blue pointe oysters on the half shell as an appetizer. For our meal I had the lobster roll good quality bread for the roll and the lobster salad is heavy on the lobster and light on the salad. The better half had the clam steamers and they were perfectly cooked and buttery garlicky.

It's a real winner."}
{"text":"Come see Ann for a wonderful Bloody Mary....here's what makes it better. Crisp fried lake perch garnish!  I gobbled mine right up!!"}
{"text":"I had the steak and lobster and it was disappointing...the lobster was ok...it was steamed and it's pretty hard to get that wrong...but the steak didn't have any flavor...sad!"}
{"text":"I give this review a little more leeway because it was the day of a Browns game, so it was very very busy. Service was kind of slow and we had a hard time getting a table, but it was understandable. It's a cute bar and I'd definitely return on a less busy time. They seem to have great happy hour specials, too.
My bf had fish and chips; he said it was good but not the best ever. The breading on it was not your typical light-colored beer battered look. I got the seafood cobb salad which was excellent. It had yellowfin tuna and shrimp, plus I appreciated that it was a diet-conscious choice. We also got two beers that were $1 off each, so that was a good value.
Overall, the experience wasn't what I would prefer, as it was very loud and full of rowdy football fans, but the food was good. I do agree with some other reviewers that it is a little overpriced, but for a seafood restaurant right downtown, I didn't expect any different."}
{"text":"I have to say that if I didn't like the food so much, this place would be getting a much worse rating.  Walked up during happy hour and there was a major bro-down going on when I got there.  There was 1 table outside open so sat down and waited then realized I'm thirsty and getting my ass up and walking through the cloud of axe body spray and onto the bar was the only way I was going to get a beer.  People eventually started filing out and I moved inside for a table and much quicker service.

They have a bunch of specials but I got to say $1 miller lite or a $2 microbrew ipa (couldn't read what kind it was) seemed like a no brainer.  For a dollar more you don't have to drink some beer flavored water.  

I got the tuna sandwich and it was a really nice piece of fish.  The waiter asked me beforehand if i wanted it rare and I was nervous but the chef cooked it well.  I love a surplus of sauces and sides and chose the redskin potatoes.  They were super tasty and cooked well, but word of warning they are definitely garlicy so beware if you plan on talking to people afterwards.  My dude got the perch platter with fries and slaw.  The perch was fried perfectly with a really nice breading and wasn't greasy at all.  The fries were definitely made in house and tasted amazing.  The slaw which I am super picky about slaw and normally it's either heinous or incredible, and theirs was definitely the latter.

We ordered 3 cocktail shrimp since they do a $1 deal on sliders, crabcakes, shrimp, clams, and oysters (you have to order 3 of something if you are going to do it though) and they looked kind of sad and limp when they came out so I didn't eat one."}
{"text":"Suggested this place to a friend after a day at the movies. Was not disappointed! We came in right in time for happy hour 5pm-7pm. They have $5 meals/appetizers at those times and we got shrimp quesadillas with surprisingly good jalapeno salad, crab cakes and wings. Local beer is always a bargain here about $1 a bottle and I was so happy they have Crabbie's ginger beer!  No other place I know has that so far, a new favorite. The staff is very welcoming. Will be back another time to have the mussels and .65 a piece oysters special ~ when I acquire the taste for it ^.^"}
{"text":"This place was a lot better than I expected for seafood in Cleveland. The mussels that I ordered tasted very fresh, possibly the best that I have had before, and the lobster bisque was awesome. The server was very friendly and funny. I will definitely be coming back to try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"Nauti Mermaid isn't your typical west 6th bar thanks to its bountiful menu, large booths, and subdued atmosphere.

Yes, the decor is a tad kitschy. What I do like about the space, I can sit at the bar, converse with people standing, and the people walking through the bar won't bump into you. If you want, you can also sit at the booths to eat and drink.

Food-wise, I've only tried a crab cake once, Sure, it's full of imitation crab and breading but they're dirt cheap - less than 2 bucks during Happy Hour, you're just getting what you pay for [and it's a deal].  

There's about 8-10 beers on draft, including a few micros (most recently, I had Founders Porter there). Prices, booze-wise are what you'd expect and fair. 

Along with dart boards and TVs, there's occasionally free music there.

The clientèle is always interesting here. Here, there's none of the hambones or a hedonistic atmosphere that you'd find at many other booze-slinging places on west 6th. I've been here a handful of times, there always happens to be businessmen visiting town, regulars, Zach Reed and other city councilmen, and the strippers about to start their shift at Christie's (a few blocks away)."}
{"text":"He's walking down and decided to pop in for a drink. Food looks so good that I had to order the crab cakes. There are exceptional deep-fried there's not usually how I like them but they were amazing. It with a cold milk Nitro Stout from Left Hand brewery. Great experience and will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Decided to foray to Cleveland for a Windians game and wanted something other than chain grub.  This place was awesome!  Great bar/restaurant with authentic old city atmosphere and truly great food.

Would nearly think of moving to Cleveland just to eat there more often!"}
{"text":"Great seafood! Took my mom here for lobster and she was very impressed, fish and chips are great, and the Happy Hour is a great deal. The $5 sliders are awesome"}
{"text":"Man this was such a tough call. Here's my logic:

Pros:
* The atmosphere is fun and entertaining in a touristy kind of way, and awesomely located in the warehouse district
* The service was very pleasant
* The food was good 

Cons:
* Holy overpriced, Batman! I cannot justify giving a grossly overpriced restaurant more than an average review. My boyfriend loved his food, and mine was good, but it served on cheap plates with cheap cups and cheap silverware. The food reminded me of Outback Steakhouse, but twice the price. I usually rate a restaurant with one question in mind: will I go back? This is a fun casual atmosphere with casual food, but gourmet prices. It just didn't make sense. =("}
{"text":"I had never even heard about the Nauti Mermaid until a friend suggested we try it for brunch this past Saturday and I'm so glad we did! Not only was the food and atmosphere great, but our bartender, Joseph, was so friendly and fun that it made the whole experience even better. 
     We came at about noon and there was only one table of two already there. We pretty much took over the majority of the bar area with 7 or so of us. There are quite a few booths that seat four people, and one bigger booth, but the bar was definitely the best place for a big party. I started with a mimosa and I think I fell in love when I saw our bartender make it the same way I make mine- mostly champagne with a splash of OJ (for color). It tasted great and they were only $5, which to me is cheap as I feel like they are generally about $7 or so. My friend ordered a Bloody Mary, which she liked and it came with a fried perch!
     As for food, they have quite a bit of seafood options, such as lobster Benedict, but they also have many non seafood options. I went with the beef hash that came with a side of potatoes. It was delicious. My only complaint is that I ordered my eggs over medium, which is usually a little runny, and these were more over hard. My friend got the sausage and gravy, which he loved. Another friend got the French toast with fruit (apples) on top, and another got the breakfast burrito, which was huge. We were all very happy with our choices. 
     When I asked for hot sauce for my meal, our bartender asked if I wanted to try the house sauce, which of course I did. It is a green sauce and is pretty spicy, but it was so good! I definitely recommend trying it instead of just frank's red hot or another. 
     Overall our experience here was great. Everything from the service to the food was perfect and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and completely satisfied my seafood need.  We are from Texas and wanted seafood.  Of course we are in vacation clothes so we found out that we couldn't go into Blue Pointe Cafe which was our original destination that had a dresscode.  I am not much for dresscode places anyway, they are obviously judgemental.  I was not disappointed by the detour at all, this place has a great atmosphere, good music and good!"}
{"text":"This was our stop after we went to the Great Lakes Science museum Yelp event.  Parking cost $5 and we had to walk a bit. 
I have heard great things about the Nauti Mermaid, but it was mostly about their brunch.  So I suggested to the husband that we try this place out instead of just going home.
Good things: really nice bar.  The bartender knows what s/he's doing.  The Rumrunners I had were top notch and were neither too strong nor too weak.  
There isn't a kids menu here, so we ordered the child some popcorn shrimp, which was well received, although unremarkable.  My spouse had a Trgs beer.  The server was super!  She even brought my daughter a sliced orange, even though it wasn't on the menu.  Five stars for service!
Mike opted for pasta with sausage and shrimp in a cream sauce with garlic toast slices.  This came with a small side salad.  It was great.  I chose the surf and turf burger; a burger with a crab cake on top, lime aioli, lettuce, onion and a pickle on the side.  I chose onion rings as my side.
Upon first impression, I was concerned that the burger would be dry, as cheese and tomatoes were absent.  However; I figured they knew their stuff, and I was correct; the aioli had an extremely subtle hint of lime and really lubed it up.  The meat nor the crab cake themselves were greasy, nor did it taste \"fishy\" as seafood imported into Ohio sometimes tends to be.  The onion rings!  Oh. My.  Seriously the best I've ever had.  I don't know what they do to them but the texture and seasoning and crunch are heavenly.  Trust me.  There were only four, but wow!  Do yourself a favor and try these gems.  
The atmosphere was really nice; during the day, family friendly pub.  Televisions, not too much junk on the walls, yet interesting.  While we dined, a bride and groom stopped in with their wedding party; I took the opportunity to snap a few candid photos.  It really says A LOT when a bride and groom go out of their way to go to a bar/restaurant  of all places...this means it's special.  And I agree.  
I suggest skipping salads and digging into the seafood here.  Don't be afraid of the burger and pasta, either.  The atmosphere is very friendly.   I'm really glad I pushed for this place...and I'll be back for brunch and bloody Marys some morning in the near future!!!"}
{"text":"Arrrrrgh you ready for some fun?  Ok, so it's mermaids and not pirates here, but the mermaid puns just aren't as funny.  

This place hit the spot for me when I visited recently.  I was in CLE for a short period of time, staying downtown, and wanted something quick, laid-back, and affordable.  This place fit the bill.  

I sat at the bar during happy hour and enjoyed a drink ($1 Miller Lite, what-what?) and a $5 appetizer (mussels - great texture and taste, I highly recommend them).  The bartender helping me was friendly, helpful, and knew the names and drinks of the \"regulars\" who came in.  It made the place feel like a neighborhood hangout, which was just the chill vibe I was going for that afternoon."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was pretty cool and the way the restaurant was decorated was interesting but just my style! The staff was not very attentive and the food was... Decent. I feel like this may have been an off night so I plan on giving this place one more chance."}
{"text":"we were looking to kill time waiting for our bus, and after unsuccessfully trying to find a bar open on a sunday we were pointed in the direction of the nauti mermaid.  success! exactly what we were looking for in a bar.  good beer (they have hopslam!), friendly staff, and decor that doesn't feel cookie cutter.  i would recommend it to anyone visits cleveland."}
{"text":"Wow!!!!!!  - don't ask for a beer here the male bartender will call you an a- hole. Never going here again. Go Browns"}
{"text":"Coming from out of state. Came on a recommendation from a friend to come here. I've had a thousand onion rings in my life- but this is the first time the batter was as thick as a donut. Is this a Cleveland version? I can't taste the onions. No clams, out of 2 beers we asked for, luke warm soup. 

Good atmosphere and friendly waitstaff. Comfortable surroundings. Mango sauce for the shrimp was very good."}
{"text":"visited this place on a recent trip to cleveland, and on a tip from a bellhop at the ritz-carlton in tower city.  it was sunday afternoon, and we had about 4 hours to kill before catching our bus back to chicago.  after having spent a disappointing night at great lakes brewing, and struggling to find anything open at tower city (outside of hard rock cafe) this bar was simply refreshing.  exactly what we were looking for.

the decor is clever and cozy, but not obnoxious.  the beers on tap were well chosen, including great lakes conway irish ale, bell's winter white, and goose island honkers ale.  (i recommend getting the tall glass.  it's probably about two pints for $6!)

sadly, we didn't get to eat here, because we had already wasted our time and money at hard rock.  if only we'd talked to that bellhop a little sooner!

anyway, i don't know when, or even if, i'll make it back to cleveland, but i do know that if i do, you will find me nestled up at the bar of the nauti mermaid for at least one afternoon/evening."}
{"text":"Oyster night. $1 Oysters. Had 1 Oyster out of 5 that could be Identified as an Oyster. Crab Cakes were decent"}
{"text":"Went here for a bachelorette party this past weekend (although I am posting this a couple months later). They were extremely accommodating, taking reservations when they usually don't. Food was fine- sliders are humongous!!! They could probably just serve 3 & still charge the same amount.... Everyone enjoyed their meal and their drinks. Loved my hard to find pear cider! They even gave us vodka soaked gummy bears which were delish! Only complaint was they wouldn't let us use multiple forms of payment- when so few people carry cash these days. However, I wouldn't let that stop me from coming back."}
{"text":"Worth the 80 mile trip to Cleveland! Been here twice and both times we were \"crab hungry.\" Alaskan King Crab you are heaven on earth! Love the beach kitsch and local color. Great service and generous mixed drinks."}
{"text":"Nauti Mermaid is great for Happy Hour. The drinks are cheap and the food is okay. The Shrimp Quesadilla was my favorite of the food items we had. This isn't a place I would wander into off the street - but as far as happy hour is concerned, Nauti Mermaid is perfection."}
{"text":"What an awesome place! We showed up during happy hour and had the crab cakes, shrimp, mussels and the best spicy shrimp quesadillas ever! Our waitress was Ann and she was so friendly and good!"}
{"text":"PSA: Worst brunch experience of my life. We were the only people there and it took 1.5 to get our food. Food came out cold and tasted horrible."}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed The Nauti Mermaid in the few times I've been there, which have spanned from summertime, when I sat in the patio area, and wintertime, where it's cozy inside.

The salmon is great. It's so tender, it falls apart, and has a good amount of flavor without being overpowering. I got a piece of that with a house salad, and it was a great, filling meal. I even had enough for lunch the next day.

The service depends on when you go, but this time it was pretty good. The atmosphere is fun and (obviously) nautical. It's a good place to watch a game, too."}
{"text":"Our waitress Jasmine was great! The food and drinks were amazing! Huge fan of the crab cakes and oysters! Happy hour prices allowed us to try a variety of drinks and food at a reasonable price!"}
{"text":"I just went to the Nauti Mermaid for the second time.  The first time was about 5 years ago, and it seems like we had almost exactly the same experience both times.  At least they have consistency going for them, which is nice...

Beyond that, both times it was kind of a lackluster affair.  Both visits were instigated by a friend who decided on the venue for a birthday dinner.  As he is certifiably insane about seafood, this seemed like a reasonable choice for him.  For those of us who are less enamored with the fruit of the sea it's pretty blah.  

For the seafood lover, it's probably an ok place, and the menu covers all of the bases - grilled and fried fish, lobster, crab, etc.  There are some land bases offerings as well, though they are kind of limited.

Our group covered a lot of ground on the menu, and aside from those who ordered lobster or crab, the prevailing opinion was that it was kind of so so.  Both the surf and turf burger and Nauti burger were pretty unremarkable.  The grilled tuna was really spicy, but wasn't notable otherwise.  The deep fried corn on the cob was pretty disappointing, I had high hopes, but there was nothing about it that made it seem better than a steamed or grilled ear of corn. 

The fried plantains were a highlight, as were the accompanying sauces, though they did seem to be a little over done, and some of them stuck together in the fryer so parts were undercooked as well. 

I will say the service was good - friendly and attentive.  While I realize this should be the expected standard, I still appreciate it nonetheless.

The nautical/divey decor, isn't really my thing, and brought to mind a Joe's Crab Shack sort of vibe.  I think when you try to do a restaurant like this anywhere other than on a beach it comes off as contrived, which it did. 

Add in to all of this, the usual Warehouse district non-sense and extravagant parking charges (due to an Indian's game and a concert that night) and it kind off balances out to blah.  

We didn't have a bad time, but I won;t be rushing back either, at least until my friend turns another year older."}
{"text":"I used to be a loyal customer here until a recent episode with the manager.

My girlfriend and I were eating with another couple.  We all ordered different amounts of shrimp and oysters for happy hour.  When they came out they were all in one gigantic bowl, which I guess might be fine if it was just my girlfriend and I.  It makes it a pain to have to keep track of who is eating what with 4 people.  I asked the server if we could have some extra bowls since apparently putting them into proper servings seemed to be a chore.

Next thing I know the manager comes over and asks \"what's the problem?\"  I asked him why everything was sent out in one huge bowl.  He explained the cook was too busy to count them out into at least 2 bowls for each couple.  I asked him how that's any different than counting them into one bowl and then asked him if we all got 4 steaks would they just bring them out on one plate for us to share.  He then says \"are you busting my cook's balls?\"  I reply that I think it's pretty lazy to not separate orders like and normal restaurant would.  He then proceeds to tell me \"this is your last time in here.  After tonight you're not welcome!\"

Nice customer service, especially from the manager.  I didn't realize that expecting what each person ordered to come out in their own bowls was too much to ask.  Nauti Mermaid has taken a turn for the worse in the last year and this is probably part of the reason.  Customer service does not seem to be a priority at all, even for loyal customers who used to come in almost every week.  I will be happy when they go out of business.  It's a shame too."}
{"text":"Awesome Happy Hour specials! $3 drafts, $2 on select bottles, $5 crab cakes (4). 

Waitress was so nice, service was very quick. 

Food was really good. I had crab cakes, my friend had a mango and walnut salad that looked very fresh and delicious. We split some fresh cut fries and onion rings - the onion rings are huge and beer battered, very well seasoned - I recommend. 

Love the cozy interior of this bar, it's like a little slice of Key West/South FL. I bet this is a nice escape after work during the wintertime. 

I will be back!"}
{"text":"It reminds me of a bar in Siesta Key, FL. Or Key West. Some of the menu items are too expensive for me to gamble on so I stick with the $12-$13 sandwiches. You can add avocado or mango to any sandwich for 50 cents per topping. That automatically makes anything better. I have had the mahi mahi and yellowfin tuna and both were good. I recommend coming here for affordable seafood in a fun, Florida-like atmosphere."}
{"text":"\"I come from six generations of seamen all with the same goal in life: catch fish, sell 'em, get drunk, and get laid. \" One memorable quote from the cult movie Cabin Boy. I instantly thought of that flick when i walked in here. I gotta admit, didn't expect such a fun and kitschy environment. We had just finished a fancy dinner next door when some friends suggested boozing around west 6th. I had my trepidations, this street is not usually where i hang out. But this place was a breath of, well, not fresh, maybe fishy, air. 

I read the other reviews and discovered this place used to be known for it's seafood. I didn't know that going in. I just thought it was a bar. What a bar! The nautical theme was over the top( in a good way). After watching Disney's 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea some years back, i decided my basement bar would be nautical themed. Turns out that diving helmets, port holes and anchors are kind of cumbersome to assemble in one's house. But who needs that, when i can come here and live out my seaman fantasies? Sorry, that came out wrong. 

I had some draught porters real cheap and my party enjoyed the jukebox(they kinda gothed it out). The cool thing was, no other patrons complained. They actually asked if they could turn it up! Real cool crowd. Mind you, it was a Sunday night. I don't know if it is less accomodating on Friday or Saturday. Oddly enough, for a faux dive with a grungey dockworker motif, the bathroom was one of the cleanest i'd ever used out about town. That's a big \"land ho\" from me, matey. 

So overall, i have to say my friends made a great choice, this place is definitely on my cool places to hang out downtown list, and to quote Cabin Boy once more...\"these pipes are clean!\" I don't really know how that relates, but it was one of the more memorable quotes from that movie."}
{"text":"Was dying to try a lobster roll and this place seem to be the only spot that had it, so my bf and I went there and let me just say the lobster rolls are bomb!!!! There fries are unreal too!! I wasn't a fan of there crab cakes because it was a little to fried for me but other than that everything there was great."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Happy hour beer, wine & appetizer menu prices are awesome!  We were walking around the warehouse district looking for food & drink!  Lucked out with this place.  Service is awesome!"}
{"text":"Great place after a Tribe game. Call ahead for lobster nachos. Big enough for two, and it will be ready by the time you walk to west 6th. Casual atmosphere and excellent bottled beer selection."}
{"text":"$0.65 cents oysters on wednesdays. 

that is all"}
{"text":"Well deserved 3-4 stars.  It very much reminds me of a beach bar in Myrtle Beach (which we were recently at).  It is a cool joint with decent craft beer draft list.  If you want decent seafood and casual bar - this is your place.  Had steamed shrimp and lobster nachos - both were good.  Be sure to walk around this area too it is in \"Warehouse District\" - neat area of bars."}
{"text":"Tasty fish n chips, great service, fun atmosphere. This was a perfect lunch break stop. Cole slaw had a kick to it, but a good change up from the typical slaw I usually get. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Went for the happy hour specials. Ordered drinks and food at the same time. Took about 20 minutes for 3 cocktails and 2 draft beers to come to our table. Our waitress was on her second day at the restaurant. She was nice and I could tell overworked.  Cocktails were allegedly $5 for happy hour. However when our bill came the two mojitos were $9 a piece as that drink wasn't a \"signature\". 

It took a while for our appetizers to come. We had shrimp quesadillas, peel & eat shrimp, oysters, sliders, crab cakes and mussels. Ordered 2 of each. The food tasted good except the mussels. They had a foul smell and were sitting in some type of purple colored liquid. They were dried and gross looking. The waitress never refilled our water or came to check on us so we weren't able to have the mussel issue addressed until our meal was complete. Our check was incorrect and twice was \"fixed\" only to still be wrong. I had to ask the bartender to find our waitress, I also had to walk towards the kitchen  to ask for a manager. Apparently the manager was too busy to talk with me. One employee said she was downstairs and a different employee said he was talking to a customer. I'm not sure the employees knew where the manager was or who the manager was since they each said a different gender and location. It ultimately took 40 minutes to pay our check because no one would help  correct it or come back to our table. 

I will NEVER go back and would tell anyone interested to save your money."}
{"text":"One the best non expensive seafood place for downtown cleveland. Service, food atmosphere wonderful. Ask Chelsea"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is here is a fun twist to your normal Seafood restaurant featuring mermaids and sea diving costumes. The beer menu is pretty solid, the food menu is not big, but it's perfect for its style. The food was all pretty good and you get a good amount and you won't feel too bloated. Fun place with a fun atmosphere recommend it for Seafood."}
{"text":"Don't go here, try somewhere else!!!! I am not from Cleveland, but i was here for a week at a conference. I have had some good food while I was here like at Hyde Park Steakhouse and a yummy sandwhich place.  I really need to start writing reviews at places that I liked, but this place wasnt one of them. We waited like 15 minutes (not exxagerating) just to put in drink orders. The drink was THE WORST cocktail I have ever had. I didnt realize it was possible to mess up a mojito but apparently it is. 

Fast forward an hour until our food came out. At the table we had clams which were rubbery and nachos which had beef that was almost not fit for human consumption. Our main courses came out, which consisted of a crab cake sandwhich that was comprised mainly of mayonaise, and walleye that was overcooked. I am usually an extremely generous tipper, but not in this case, as the 2 hours it took to eat this crappy food was disappointing from the very start. If you want seafood in Cleveland, try a different place please, like Blue Point Grill, I ate there my first day and enjoyed it. Save yourself the headache of eating here, you will thank me later."}
{"text":"Best food we had in Cleveland, by far!!! I ordered jerk chicken which was both filling and tasty, I mean FULL of flavor!! He ordered the chicken wings and said the same thing.. I believe he ordered teriyaki garlic and honey BBQ.. And our waiter was great!  Full of energy, I can't remember his name though :~{"}
{"text":"The seafood is super fresh.  It's a little kitchy but I think that what it's going for and succeeds at it!"}
{"text":"We came to the restaurant since the reviews didn't look so bad. We had a hankering for seafood.  So we came here to the Nauti Mermaid. 

 As we walked in, it had your standard run of the mill bar. With a beach theme for the bar. Booths on one side, the bar on the other. 

 My husband and I ordered lobster nachos, crab cakes (happy hour special), lobster BLT, and mahi-mahi. 

  The food came out the slowest pace known to man. I'm 1/2 convinced the kitchen was run by sloths.  It took 25 min for our lobster nachos to arrive and the lobster had a bad smell to it as if it was pulled from behind the fridge after it had been forgotten for a week. Very fishy smell and fishy taste.  Then the crab cakes came. They were small medallions with this dill tartar sauce, which I will say the sauce was edible.  The crab cakes were so darn greasy. I felt like I was eating crab flavored batter. 

 After our appetizers came and went. We sat for another 25min (total has been 40 min) for our entrees. My husband BLT, looked ok by the photo. But the flavor was salty and again with the fishy flavor, old and outdated lobster. 

 My mahi-mahi was terrible. The fish was overcooked and hard. How do you cook fish and make it like cardboard? that's an art within itself. The rice was some kind of uncle bens rendition. The only thing I could say was fresh, was the mango salsa which was n everything. The waitress was snarky, the kitchen was slow and the food was terrible. We spent a total of $62. on this place. NOT WORTH IT! 

Don't go here! You will regret the money you spend. SEAFOOD IS AWFUL."}
{"text":"Came here with a large group after one of the all too rare Browns wins and were treated to great service, very good and reasonably priced food, and a good cocktail and beer menu. They also have several tvs airing the games. 

The lobster nachos are great for sharing and you get a surprising amount of lobster. The mussels were also very good (watch out for the horseradish). They had a great selection of seafood (Maine Lobster Rolls, crab cakes, fried oysters) as well as your standard pub food. There is something for everyone here."}
{"text":"This is a nice little divey joint on the west 6th strip . They just opened up second seating area brand spanking new. Personally I like the anchors away slash shipwreck theme in the front room. Good execution of theme without going overboard (wakka wakka). Biggest come hither for me was the \"$1 miller lite drafts for now until further notice every day\" sign out front. Luckily just happened to be a Wednesday on the day of my patronage, which features 65 cent oysters and shrimp! Oysters were not sandy, medium sized, not as fresh as blue point grille across the street but still a good deal. The shrimp were medium large size, cooked and came with a delightful side cocktail sauce (a little sweet for me but better with some horseradish and hot sauce) and a sweet mango salsa.

Our server ellen was super cute and attentive. We were able to walk in and get a booth immediately at 730pm. 

After 630pm on weekdays and all day weekends free parking at the meters!"}
