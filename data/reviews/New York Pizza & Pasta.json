{"text":"Great lunch specials.  Good New York \"Godfather\" feel to the place."}
{"text":"The best Authentic NY Style Pizza and Atmosphere!
Perfect crust, sauce, cheese and toppings. Feel like I'm back in NYC whenever we go there. The staff is super attentive and friendly. Prices are a bargain IMHO. Best kept Pizza secret in Vegas!"}
{"text":"1 star = Terrible. Multiple things went wrong. Never going back.
2 star = Not good. I will not go back, but it wasnt absolutely awful.
3 star = Good, not great. I wouldnt go out of my way, but I *would* go back.
4 star = Excellent food. I really liked it. I could be a regular here.
5 star = Phenomenal food. Something truly special here.

I am a bit surprised at all the 5-star ratings. Maybe I am a pizza snob. This place was fine, but nothing to write home about. Mark Rich's II in Summerlin pwns this place. Words like authentic, NYC, etc. seem, to me, to be a bit of a reach.

Everything was ok. We ordered mozz sticks, friend mushrooms, a medium pizza and 2 cokes (Pepsi, bleck). The apps were good and the pizza sauce they served for dipping was good too. The pizza was blah. The sauce didnt have a lot of flavor and there wasnt much cheese on the pie. Toppings were sparse, which would have been fine with better sauce and higher quality cheese.

The people were really really nice, but our waitress came in from a smoke break, headed right to the kitchen and brought us out our food. Ew. Also, we paid over $40 bucks with tip for the items listed above - 2 sodas, 2 apps, and a medium pizza.

One other thing: the decor is really run down. That didnt bother me -- I like hole in the wall places -- but just FYI.

This is close to work, so I would probably try it again with co-workers."}
{"text":"First time ordering from here...Not my last time!!   The pizza delivered in 35 min hot and perfectly done.  OOOOOOOY GOOOOY  cheese, just enough sauce and as close to NY as I've found here in Vegas.  Next time I crave pizza I will certainly call!  And we will also try their other foods as well."}
{"text":"Love this place, love the chicken ceaser salad!!!and the pizza and bread sticks are great also! everyone is usually friendly, havent had a bad experience yet!!"}
{"text":"Found this place on a long term quest for Sicillian pie that is as good as I got on the East Coast years ago.
Eureka!!! I found it here by the slice and it's as good as I've ever had. 
Will be a regular stop  on all my Vegas trips.
Check the photo on there web page of a slice of Sicillian. 
Mouth watering..."}
{"text":"Placed a to go order today through eat24/7 and was quoted 45-60 minutes.  After 1 hour 15 minutes I called to check on my order.  The guy who answered the phone was very rude and told me it would be there in about 20 minutes.  I told him that I had to go to work and didn't think his driver would make it on time.  He then proceded to yell at me and tell me to just cancel my order and then he hung up on me.  Obviously they don't believe in good customer service."}
{"text":"Just like back east. Food pizza and the staff is like being in your grandmas kitchen in Brooklyn without the bad words. Worth the trip off the strip for good pizza."}
{"text":"Not sure about the pizza but the calzones were great until I saw a roach crawling beside me on the wall. On another day, I ordered for someone at work,  the young girl answering the phones just hung up after I said thank u. That's what really pissed me off.  I think I'm done with this place."}
{"text":"Pizza was very good. Thin crust is good but my husband prefers a regular crust which they don't make."}
{"text":"Food here is good. The portions are pretty good. Ordered the chicken wings and they are not small they are good sized and also had the chicken Parmesan which is pretty big so can always share. Prices are a little up there but if you want good food then you definitely have to pay for it."}
{"text":"Called for a delivery and once I was done saying my order I asked how much it was going to be and he told me he can't tell me at that moment because it was busy..but other then that I love their chicken wings!"}
{"text":"Our family loves NY pizza & pasta. 
Staff is always friendly!
You can't beat the pizza & pasta buffet for the kids/ really the whole family! 
And they have a large menu to order yummy Italian dishes from!
This place pleases the whole family and it's a favorite of ours!"}
{"text":"Just wanted my sandwich made again. I ordered no onions with peppercinnis and I got extra onions but like 3 pieces of peppercinnis. I called them and they want to see my sandwhich because the cook states he didnt add onions! Really!! Good thing I ate half. I saved my thrash with the onions and going to give it back and demand my money back. Or a new comolete sandwich. This is rediculous! Why would I lie about onions????"}
{"text":"Stop the presses!  I have searched and searched all over Las Vegas and I finally found a GREAT slice of pizza! Yesssssssssssss!!! I literally have wasted so much money running around looking for a good place to get good pizza and pasta. I went in and the owner was sitting there greeting the guests.  I loved that. He spoke with us and even let us sample the meatballs.....hhhhmmmmmm, so good!  We ordered the special and ate right then and there, then ordered pasta and a large pizza to take with us. Well, we never ate the pizza, I went to visit my niece and she had company (visitors for those who are not from the South) and they were hungry so I offered up the food.  They LOVED it and I gave them a menu that I had because they wanted to order themselves.  That was Friday May 13th.  I have been thinking about Pizza all night and will be there when the doors open this morning.  I am glad that I dont have to run around Vegas eating the icky pizza and paying outrageous sums for bad food. This place has old fashioned good food with a great atmosphere and the best prices ever. You will not be disappointed. I love this place."}
{"text":"We ordered the pepperoni pizza and garlic knots...both had great flavor.  This pizza joint has a nice New York feel to it, and the customer service was wonderful!  The staff was friendly and they gave recommendations.  I can't remember how much our bill was, but I know it was reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Yum!! great food! Had my first date with my boy friend here and this pizza was so good!"}
{"text":"This must be mainly a locals joint, but thank God for Yelp. The hubby and I were starving for pizza and this place popped up. We scrolled through the pics and drooled over how good the garlic knots looked and someone's specialty order of Sicilian pizza. We were sold. We showed up and the man behind the counter knew we were first timers and told us to have a seat anywhere, he took our drink order and asked if we wanted garlic knots while we looked over the menu. It was as if he read our minds. We also ordered the specialty pizza that we saw on Yelp, Sicilian pizza with spinach, mozz, meatball, & ricotta. First off the knots, holy smokes were they delicious! They were accompanied by piping hot homemade marinara that complimented the knots so perfectly. Next, the Sicilian pizza. As it made its way to the table it was admired by all, everyone in the joint couldn't take their eyes off it. As we stuffed our faces, patrons came to our table to ask what kind of pizza we had. Not only did it look good, it tasted phenomenal. The crust was thick and held the toppings well, the cheese was stringy and delicious, the meatballs, ricotta, and spinach madonna mi! My mouth is watering as I write. To top it off, our waiter hooked us up with complimentary cannolis since it was our first time. The shell crunchy, the filling not too sweet and complimented with chocolate chips, the powdered sugar covered my lips like Tony Montana in Scarface. We will be back next time we come to Vegas, thank you for the hospitality."}
{"text":"This place has a nice buffet that is worth checking out if you enjoy that sort of thing.  The buffet has a salad, a few pasta items, several pizzas and stromboli.  Although they call themselves NY they really aren't, the crust is too think to be NY style.  Even if it isn't traditional NY pizza it tastes just fine and I've enjoyed both their sandwiches and calzones."}
{"text":"I'm from upper New Jersey and have the experience of pizza up there. This restaurant's pizza is just like home.  Amazing crust! And their delicious sauce and spices that mesh well with their one of a kind melted cheeses. You will not be disappointed EVER here."}
{"text":"I have only ordered delivery so I can not offer a review of eating in. However, now that I know they have a salad bar, I will be stopping in! I love a salad bar. My delivery experience has been exceptional! I have to say they are some of the nicest people I have ever experienced! From the person who answers the phone to take my order, to the person who delivers the food; they are beyond polite, professional and friendly! I have ordered the pizza numerous times and it is great! The crust is thin and cooked just right, with an abundant amount of toppings. I hate a stingy pizza!  I have also ordered the lasagna and antipasto. Both were also delicious! Way to go NY Pizza & Pasta in Indian Trail! You are doing everything right!"}
{"text":"I ordered the wings and fries from here recently and they were awful. The chicken was bland, season-less and incredibly dry. They give you a small cup of hot sauce  on the side instead of preparing the wings properly.
The only good thing I can say is that the delivery was fast."}
{"text":"Great Pizza, great pasta. My family has eaten here many time and the food quality and service have been consistently top notch. It is a relatively small \"hole-in-the-wall\" family restaurant and the staff has always been very friendly. Recently, I placed a very large carry-out order on short notice, and everything was perfect and ready at the exact time I requested. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I ordered The Works Pizza and 10 Chicken Wings for delivery. I just got a new phone and autocorrect changed my street address. The delivery driver was already heading to Rainbow and Tropicana and I was at Rainbow and Cheyenne. As soon as I discovered the error, I called and they said no problem at all. They are located at Jones and Sahara which is no where near me. They were very accommodating and had no complaints at all even though it was my error. The friendly service was refreshing. Both the pizza and wings were still hot when they arrived and was exactly what I needed! Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"I really like their food but every time I make an order for delivery they end up messing my order up. I always order a pepperoni pizza with mushrooms and they never put mushrooms on it so every time I call to complain they hand up the phone"}
{"text":"The name really fooled me. We had pizza with pepperoni and sausage, plain wings and a cheese calzone. Nothing had taste. Pizza was bland, wings were dry and tasteless and the calzone was burnt on the bottom also no taste. This is what happens when you use cheap cheeses. No wonder during dinner there was 1 table in the dining room. Please stop insulting my New York by using it to name your establishment. Previous comments must be from friends and family or the owner.

ZERO STARS"}
{"text":"Fast, friendly, service, prices are reasonable for the portions. Very satisfied. Only spent $38 for 6 people."}
{"text":"Our order took 1 hour and 23 minutes to get here. The only thing good in the sampler appetizer was the breaded mushrooms. The onion rings had an odd after taste, the zucchini was mushy, and the mozzarella sticks kind of fell apart. This could possibly be because all of our food was cold. Well, except the ranch, that was quite warm. The pasta was OK...I wouldn't order from here again. People order when they are hungry. They don't want long wait times or cold food that has to be reheated. Children can't wait this long to eat."}
{"text":"Just called for delivery was told that I'm too far and they're too busy, they won't deliver to my home. 1. Have literally been to my house a dozen times before. Including six days ago. 2. Are listed on the yelp app as being 2 1/2 miles from my house. 

Infuriated. Food is generally good. Service, well, that's another matter."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh. Best marinara AND best Alfredo I've ever had in my life. Bf ordered the cheese ravioli (ricotta stuffed with marinara sauce) and it was so fantastic!!! I couldn't get enough of the sauce that the raviolis were served with... Mopped it up with the wonderful garlic bread.

I ordered the fetuccini Alfredo and the sauce was the creamiest sauce I've ever had in my life! Seriously. Sooooooo good. 

Pizza here is also fantastic, that I've had at an earlier date."}
{"text":"Love this place.  The pizzas are perfect New York style and when I ask them to cook it a little well done....they actually do.  Garlic knots are crazy good.  The owners and staff are a blast to be around."}
{"text":"I remembered pizza being ordered for lunch at work once from a \"New York\" pizza place that was pretty good and since this place was close by I thought this was it. I tried the buffet and the pizza I had was NOT as good as I remembered but was decent. The salad bar was ok as well but the dressings were horrible! I tried the Italian first and then ranch and both were bad. The pasta didn't look appetizing so I didn't try it. Overall the pizza is probably just a level above CiCi's."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Vegas!!! I'm from St. Louis and love St. Louis style pizza, which you can't find anywhere in Vegas, but this place has made me love New York style pizza! Great people too!"}
{"text":"This place has been around for awhile and hasn't changed much.  The pizza is OK.    If your sick of th chain pizza places and you want something more homeade then this will do just fine.  If you want some really GOOD pizza, ask me and I'll steer you in the right direction."}
{"text":"My wife and I are originally from CT, and consider ourselves to be picky when it comes to pizza.  A friend told us to try this place, we're really glad we did as the pizza is very good, the service is always friendly and the best part is that it is close to home so when we need a quick fill in this is a really great option.  I grew up eating New Haven style pizza (about 20 minutes from Wooster Street) and although I would not rate NYPP with those pizzerias, I would still say that this is a great option for those in Indian Trail."}
{"text":"This pizza is very good and a reasonable price to boot.  By far the best pizza in the area and we've tried them all.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I LOVE NYP&P, thay make one of the best pies in Las Vegas ( and i base this on a lot of places i've eaten) Their house salad reminds me of eating at my Nonna's hose when i was little, and their Sicilian pizza is by far the best i've ever had in Vegas.
All their ingredients are fresh and tasty, and i just found out that on Sundays during football season they do a deal with a bucket of bear (get the Costello it's great) and a large 1 topping pizza for $25! i know where i'm taking all my buddies on Sundays from now on!"}
{"text":"I wish there were ,more stars!!!
This is the best pizza in las Vegas!!!
Also try the eggplant. There is nothing comparable in LV.

If you are ever going to use a caterer. Use them great prices, Unbelievable food. Comes with everything, plates,utensils, Warner's, and even came with serving spoons"}
{"text":"Nice place to eat, staff is really nice and friendly, good food at a great price, will defenitly come back again"}
{"text":"I'm from New York (Brooklyn) and New York Pizza & pasta Is as close to New York as you can get west of the Hudson River.  I have my orders delivered and their always on time.  Their delivered pastas are also excellent.  My only gripe, and it's a small one, is when I order a pasta dish which comes with a substantial salad and I emphasize No Onions they sometimes put them on anyway.

Wow, I made myself hungry.  I think I'll call them up right now."}
{"text":"Orderd pizza on line got a 16\" sausage and extra cheese pizza, came nice and hot, got it in 38 min. Perfect. Loved it !!!"}
{"text":"We are originally from CT and haven't been able to find any good pizza places in the area- until now. This place has take out, delivery (certain miles), buffet and dine in seating. We dined in. Buffet is basic but you'd be missing out if you didn't order off the menu. Amazing NY style pizza. The calzone was delicious! Appetizers were amazing. The best was probably the soups!!! They are to die for!!!!!! Great friendly service (it is NC after all!)"}
{"text":"Wanted to try out a new spot for lunch and decided to dine here. The food, service, and environment was very satisfying. I ordered their Philly Cheese Chicken and enjoyed every bite of it. The server was also super sweet and helped me pick out a dish that suited my cravings. I would rate this place a five star if only my food was served faster. I have a limited lunch break of one hour and had to shove my meal down my throat to finish on time. Other than that I'm loving this place! I plan on trying their catering options next time I have a potluck or party to host."}
{"text":"Gotta eat at this place . I left for 4 years for the Army and in Afghanistan I craved their food . I'm home on leave and could not miss this seeing everyone there and the food."}
{"text":"I literally just paid 25$ for this pizza (which I can't really even call a pizza) including tax, delivery and tip. It's a soggy pile of toppings on a paper thin soaking wet layer of dough. Now, I know I'm spoiled because I grew up in Buffalo with the best pizza around, but seriously- don't call yourself a pizza place and charge that kind of money for such a shit product. 
Never again."}
{"text":"THE GREASIEST PIZZA I'VE EVER HAD... and not in a good way. Per slice, I needed at least 3 napkins just to blot the excess grease off that was just glazed on the surface. The garlic knots were literally swimming in a pool of oil. I wish I took a picture of it. I felt like the smell was seeping out if my pores an hour later, not to mention a lovely stomachache to follow.

Pizza slice size was decent, but the prices are not exactly cheap either though. Personally felt it was overpriced for what it was and I really can't really say anything was outstanding or significant. I'll stick to Pizza Hut next time... cheaper & delivery time isn't 45 minutes when google maps states we are only 1.1 miles away. :P"}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever had! Ordered a pizza and it wasn't baked long enough! The middle was soggy and the vegetables where cold, there was tomato sauce poured on the top of the pizza; called, spoke with a manager and he said\"well, what do you want me to do\"  he was very rude! And then hung up on me! I would NEVER recommend this restaurant!  disgusting food, disgusting service!"}
{"text":"Love the food and the staff are always nice. The garlic knots are great, the rolls are great and a great price for the amount of food. We have never had an issue with delivery. Never been to NY, but the pizza is thin and good sized slices. The caprese salad is excellent."}
{"text":"I like pizza. I loved this place. While the strip tries to emulate the East coast feel, this place is genuine from when you walk in. I had the sicillian with pepperoni and sausage. It's a thick bready pizza, not a traditional thick crust. Wow was it good. Their sauce was simple like my mom made, and while pepperoni will make any pizza greasy, this wasn't. I saw their thin crust on other tables and was even more motivation to return. Plenty of room for larger parties their.
4 for the pizza plus 1 for the price and making me long for the East coast."}
{"text":"Ordered a delivery thin crust cheese and it was GREAT'! And wait time was only 30minutes!! Very satisfied!"}
{"text":"I am from back east, Waterbury Connecticut. I really love this place, it makes me a little home sick. The food is wonderful, the people who run this are the friendly, and courteous, and have class. They try to make everyone happy, that's a fact. I have seen the owner himself tell people \"no charge\", if something was late getting out of the kitchen. If you want that New York style food and  atmosphere, look no farther. I travel to Las Vegas almost every week, and usually wind up here on a Friday night."}
{"text":"Worst customer service over the phone! Take forever on delivery. Can't keep the orders right. Not professional at all. People there are rude, you can tell how they talk to you! I will never order here again and tell others too!"}
{"text":"decided to have a family dinner here tonight and it was delicious. DJ was our server and he did a wonderful job for a party of 8. Best pizza and wings in town ."}
{"text":"Not bad , but not the greatest.  We got the BBQ wings, fries, and the vegetarian pizza on thin crust. I know what a great combo. The veggie pizza got soggy quick because of the tomatoes. I like more sauce and there was little of it and more cheese. We took ours to go, but if you dine in you'll get a feel of the Bronx right here in our backyard. My take worth trying if you need to try something new."}
{"text":"Pizza is ok. Service is horrible. The two people at the counter completely ignored me. Finally the cook asked to help me. He gave me my pick up order. I would have gotten a dessert added, I was standing there checking out there menu, but they continued to ignore me even as I asked him a question. I would not go back here"}
{"text":"We are locals and we absolutely love this place, the food is authentic Italian, the REAL deal! Sicilian pizza and thin slice pizza, a great variety of fresh salads, eggplant parmigiana, chicken parm, etc... Don't let these other reviews that are so critical steer you from a good foodie experience. Family atmosphere, good all around and catering too. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"One of the best pizzas in Vegas. New York style. Great crust. Not soggy at all. A liberal amount of sauce and the perfect amount of stringy cheese. 

I've had this pizza as take out and it's just not as good as when it comes straight out of the oven. 

They have very garlicky garlic knots. This last time they were a little undercooked but still delicious. 

The Greek salad was delicious. It may be better called the feta cheese salad because it had so much cheese on it. I could have used probably half the cheese and more lettuce. Unlike most places that give you mostly lettuce and scarce topping this place gives you lots of olives, cucumbers, tomatoes and mounds of cheese. 

Excellent friendly service. 

I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place!! Not only is the pizza delicious, the staff is very friendly as well! They made a heart shaped pizza for my son on Valentines Day and it made him so happy! Hands down the best pizza in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time because I seen positive reviews here on yelp about it and I have to say that the pizza here is really good which suprised me because I didn't expect it to taste as good as it did didn't try the wings or fries from here but the next time I do it will be the next meal on my agenda as I plan to eat here again whenever I get the chance."}
{"text":"Make sure to look over the charges on your check, to make sure they are accurate before paying!! Ordered four cheese slices and two waters.. got charged the lunch special which includes being charged for two sodas. It's a small additional charge but it's the principle. When explained to the male server, he said \"oh well, it was just easier to put it. I'm busy.\" We then went to the register to pay and explained it to a very nice lady and she was very apologetic and said what he did was not right. 

We returned for a second time only for the server to act smug towards us, drop slices and waters off...never refilling our waters or asking if we needed anything else, and then dropped the check off saying \"make sure you look it over carefully\". Once again, he pulled the same move and overcharged us. WILL NOT RETURN."}
{"text":"Looked at the reviews and they are pretty half and half. But im pregnant and I wanted pasta.. and I wanted it now!! I ordered the chicken susan for delivery. (Chicken, broccoli, fetticini, and cream sauce) Its pretty good. It took exactly 50 mins for it to get here. But my expected time was 60 mins. So its okay. Everything was super wrapped in foil. My tin plate, my cup of marinara sauce, my garlic twists, my garlic bread. Everything!!  Which was greatly appriciated because i saw a review saying they recieved their pasta cold. (Maybe they took note and tried to fix their mistake) Everything was nice and hot!! The sauce needed a little salt but iv always felt that way about every cream sauce iv tried. But OMG the broccoli is perfect!! A little buttery. Not too much. Yummy! The pasta comes with a side salad.. but they forgot mine :( I forgave them because most places you have to pay for a side salad. And they also include a pretty big slice of garlic bread :) yum!! I wasnt even expecting it! I also ordered the garlic twist. Pretty good. But if you like your bread with ranch instead of marinara sauce be sure to let them know. My only complaint about the actual food is.. I wish they grilled the chicken instead of boiled it. Its not bad.. I just think it would taste amazing grilled!! Ill ask next time :) I say just try this place!! And see for yourself. Its all a great price too."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza in vegas. So close to being back in NY. Garlic knots are great also"}
{"text":"Yummy pizza. Garlic knots are my favorite. Definitely one of the better pizza places around here. Delivery service took too long. Was told 45-60 minutes for delivery and ended up waiting 1 hour and 45 minutes."}
{"text":"We had this place cater our wedding. Everything was great. Pizza is good. My only complaint is we went there again today (6 months later) but not worth a star dock is that the people at the register talked and didn't even acknowledge us standing right in front until the pizza maker said to ask us what we would like. Also this is silly but I got a combo of pizza and salad- the salad was a chunk of tomatoe and onion. I don't like either so I came home and basically had to make my own salad. But who orders salad from a pizza place anyways, right?  still worthy of 5 stars."}
{"text":"Rather bummed by my experience. Decided to try a new pizza/pasta spot. The order showed up significantly later than the time anticipated. Not only did I not receive all of my order also received another customers order. Called for assistance from the store and was simply told to keep the other customers order and hung up on quickly. Eat24, who I ordered thru gave no help at all. Only reason there is two stars is that the breaded raviolis were fantastic. Worth the time and effort? Questionable."}
{"text":"I have never tried the pizza here, but my family and I are huge fans of the meatballs. We order them quite often for large family occasions, or for spaghetti nights at the house. They are a great price, and taste absolutely delicious. The crew is very friendly, and attentive."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! We were referred by a friend and this place did not disappoint. The staff were all nice, friendly, and just wanted to give exceptional customer service. Big Mike makes you feel like family entering his home.The food was also amazing. Their garlic knots were the best I've ever had. We will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Ordered on-line through Yelp and it took 1.5 hrs. to get to me. I called the restaurant and they said it was picked up then the delivery person called 2 seconds after and said they were lost for 30 mins looking for me. I think that wasn't the truth because if you are a delivery driver you should be using some type of GPS to ensure your there on time. Now to the food we ordered a Cesar Salad and it was GROSS. The dressing was nothing but oil, the chicken pieces were HUGE and should have been cut a little more. The only thing that wasn't bad was the croutons. The Philly Steak was oily, and cold. The fries were bad also. I don't think I will order from them ever again."}
{"text":"This place is lucky there is not a way to degrade them on yelp, but they seriously suck they can not even get there delivery orders out on time and to top it off the man that answerered the phone is so rude. Seriously the worst service from this place. Do not try n order here and have your food never delivered."}
{"text":"I ordered the Sicilian pizza with heavy sauce and light cheese and ended up with a giant piece of bread with barely any sauce, too much cheese, and no flavor. I went off of the reviews but I'm assuming that there specially there is New York style only so I would stick with that. And on top of that it took an hour to be delivered it was slightly cold"}
{"text":"Just moved to Las Vegas, and ordered Pizza and Salad for my family.  Great price, great food and it was delivered in less than the 45 minutes they told us to wait!  THANK YOU!"}
{"text":"I've ordered delivery from here twice. We've tried their pizza, wings, and garlic knots. The pizza is really good, but a bit on the greasy side. I've tried their mild wings and hot wings. The mild ones didn't have much flavor, but the hot ones were very good! The garlic knots were good, but VERY garlicky. They were pretty yummy. The delivery guy has been very friendly each time. I will definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"I don't know about the pasta but the pizza and wings here are certainly legit. Went for the Sicilian style pizza, which is available by the slice. The wings here don't get much praise in other reviews but I was pleasantly surprised with the price/portion received and the meatiness of the actual wings. 
Props for being able to order online, staff was prompt when I arrived to pick up my order. Location is a little run down and old-school, personally I'd just get take out there rather than dining in."}
{"text":"Last Thursday my husband and I did a mini pizza crawl . We went 3 places . Of the three New York pizza &a pasta was by far the best over all for 3 reasons . 
1 . The sauce just the right amount. W great seasoning 
2 the cheese and crust . The mozzarella cheese was fresh gooey and perfect. The crust was thin and foldable 
3. We got to meet and talk to the owners which was an amazing experience in it self .what a great pizza experience. Will be back soon"}
{"text":"Really authentic NY style thin crust pizza that is absolutely the best in Las Vegas! I have had pizza, calzones and chicken Parmesan here- outstanding!
Great service at the tables-casual dining that reminds me of my Favorite pizza places in Jersey!"}
{"text":"This is a little hole in the wall kinda place. The food there was EXCELLENT! I ordered the patty melt w fries and my husband ordered the chicken parmesan sub. We were both surprised at how delicious it was. I'm not sure how pizza is there but I would expect it to be just as good. I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"We ordered the party special ordered two large pizzas with two toppings and the 2 liter soda. We also got wings. The food was good however they forgot my 2 Liter soda, also they did not include any Parmesan cheese or red pepper."}
{"text":"I have been coming in here for years and just like this past sunday, the food hasn't changed. Pizza and sauce were great, complimented by the fries. Not a huge fan of the size of fries, but still good. 

Staff is friendly and it feels like a family atmosphere. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Hubby and I were wasting time before a doctor's appointment yesterday and decided to eat lunch out. We wanted somewhere close to the office, but with good food. I'd seen some decent reviews about New York Pizza & Pasta and it was right up the street from our final destination. With this in my mind, I pointed my husband to the restaurant. 

We got there not too long after they opened and they weren't too busy. We choose our own seat and set out to figure out what to eat. We decided to split a Medium \"Works\" pizza NY style as well as some mozzarella sticks. The mozaarella sticks came out first and were so good! They definitely hit the spot! The pizza was out quickly too and I was not expecting such large pieces! The pizza was delicious and very filling. 

We will definitely be back to NY Pizza & Pasta in the future!"}
{"text":"Pizza was very authentic and cheap.  Thin crust and just the right amout of toppings.  Make sure to fold it.  The guys who work here were probably the most friendly I've experienced in a NY pizzeria in a long time.  We also had some pasta, but the main event was the pizza."}
{"text":"Amazing wings, amazing garlic bread. Definitely gonna have again. I highly remand. Good price for amount of food giving."}
{"text":"Still catching up on my reviews. 

Why does every pizzeria Either use 'NY' in their name or 'NY Style' in their descriptions/ads, when they dont have a clue what NY Pizza is?

Cause they know it will attract people and half of those attracted have no clue what NY style pizza is so they claim its the best NY pizza they ever had in their reviews and it makes others try it, cause well, if enough say it, we will only know the truth by trying it.

The other 50% know better, but unfortunately, we dont know for sure until we try it. Which we will based on the 'Best NY Style Pizza In Town' reviews.

People really need to stop this \"little boy who called wolf' attitude. If you dont know the 1st thing about Basket Weaving, dont write reviews claiming you are an expert in basket weaving.

All this b.s. is rendering the entire review process as being useless.

If you like something, by all means, say you like it and explain why. Conversely, if you dont like something, feel free to say you dont and explain why.

But if your not an expert in Basketball shoes, dont write reviews saying you are an expert and this pair at the dollar store is better then Nike Air J's..,

Bottom line is dishonest reviews do not help anybody. 

I tried this place 3 times (kids love buffets as do I and I am always willing to give anyplace 2 or 3 tries before rendering an opinion Im going to share with others). 

To say this is NY Style pizza is simply ridiculous. Not only is it not NY STYLE, its not even comparable to a frozen pizza you get at the grocery store. The 7-11 up the road has better pizza. The sams club a mile away has better pizza. None are NY Style, but they are not bad and they are sure as heck alot better then this pizza. 

This pizza is not even close to ci ci's buffet for goodness sakes. Im not joking when I say the pizza at Sams club and the 7-11 up the road is better then this. Its alot better.

This is not NY style Pizza. Its not even good pizza. Period."}
{"text":"Fan-frickin-tastic place. Delivered to my work for only a buck! I ordered the small calzone....yeah it's like HUGE. Size of half a pizza almost. It is fantastic tasting, has fresh ingredients, and is very well made."}
{"text":"Best New York style pizza in Vegas. I  love pizza and this is my favorite! Family owned."}
{"text":"Very friendly prompt service. Had a sausage and peppers sandwich with added sauce, no cheese. Sausage was tasty, marinara spot on. I like my bread a little crustier but that's personal preference and it was still good just soft. Definitely will come back and give their pizza a try but probably not after dark (neighborhood is a little sketchy)."}
{"text":"Just waited 2 hours for small pizza with almost no toppings on half and cold over-priced cheese sticks with no specifically asked for ranch. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food!!!!  Very nice staff. I have to admit that when we walked in I had my doubts about this place. The food was really good and great prices. We ordered garlic knots for an appetizer, I ordered a calzone and my husband had a mini pizza, we also had some Cannolis and the bill was only $27 and some change. Their sauce is to die for, I could literally drink it.   Give them a try you won't be disappointed. We do not live in the area but when we travel we always like to try out a local hole in the wall pizza place. We will definitely be back to this place next time we come to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Best Pie's And Garlic Knot's In Town."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since 1996 and always enjoyed their pizza but the last time I came in it seemed different. I ordered mozzarella sticks and when they came out they were dead frozen in the middle and they charged 7.99 for 6 skinny store bought mozzarella sticks. When I sent them back they re-fried and broken in half. Stick to getting their pizza."}
{"text":"Just an okay pizza. 

I order delivery and it came within 45 minutes. The pizza was on the salty side and very very greasy side. The cheese was also on the rubbery end too. 

The delivery guy didn't not have anything with him! No red pepper, no Parmesan, and no napkins! 

I won't be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Nothing crazy awesome about this place.  I would go here again, pizza is just OK...didn't blow my mind. Not some place I would take a friend from out of town."}
{"text":"Stuffed shells and calzone are yummy. Calzone is HUGE! Will eat there again. Repeat order though, we were missing an item in  our calzone. Fast and hot delivery."}
{"text":"Very good Pizza and Pastas..l plan to try everything on their menu eventually. 

Some People are inventors some are explorers some are soldiers some are leaders, but my most noble of all callings...is to be an eater! 

Yes an explorer of the most dangerous sort that of the unknown magic of a mysterious menu. Please Pray for me my fellow Yelpers, that I have the fortitude to continue eating what no man has eaten before and the full pocketbook to pay for it and the Iron Stomach just in case.

Cheers one and all!"}
{"text":"I ordered a stuffed pizza it was ok not the best"}
{"text":"I've driven by this place many times and I'm glad I finally gave it a try! I stopped in and placed a to-go order. They have a large dining area with plenty of seating. The cashier was very friendly and helpful while I took my time looking over the menu. They do sell slices if you're not looking for a whole pie, and I was pleased with the mini pizza option, which is baked fresh with your choice of 2 toppings. I ordered mine with fresh broccoli and eggplant. The eggplant was sliced very thin and breaded-- I bet they make a good eggplant parmesan, too. This thin crust mini pizza was enough food for 2 people.

The fettucine alfredo was also delicious. The sauce was rich and silky with plenty of cheese flavor, and plenty of butter, as well. This was served with a slice of garlic bread and a side salad with really good ranch dressing. With an extensive menu, this place should satisfy your pizza and pasta cravings."}
{"text":"This place deserves my five stars. Walking in you can feel the family vibe to it, and the aroma of the food lingers in a good way. 

I've never had real NY pizza, but this is the best pizza place I've ever had out here in Las Vegas.

Their dressings are home made, pizza hand tossed, the overall staff is very welcoming, and friendly. I see that these people really appreciate food, and their business."}
{"text":"I was hanging out with my friend on the strip, and we turned to yelp to find a hole in the wall Italian place for pizza or pasta. YELPERS BEWARE- the food was so bad that I honestly wondered if they pay people to write good reviews. Imagine a deep dish Pizza Hut pizza, add some grease, and you've got the pizza we had. The garlic knots came chewy (frozen?) and in a pool of oil wrapped in a foil bowl. 
Definitely regret spending $17 on a large pizza (we ended up tossing the leftovers) and would have been better off going to Costco for pizza."}
{"text":"Ordered chicken fingers meal and a piece of Sicilian pizza with sausage through Eat24, waiting almost two hours for delivery when the app quoted one hour--food was cold, French fries were soggy but once I spent another 20 mins reheating the food it was pretty tasty. Chicken finger (plain) were above average after reheating, fries average. I asked for hot sauce on the side, got ranch dressing only. Sicilian pizza was acceptable after re-heat but I am from New York so my standards may be higher. All in all, I won't order again because clearly they cannot manage their deliveries (I live 12 mins away) if you don't have the man power to execute deliveries within a normal time frame than limit your delivery parameters! It's not ok to expect someone to wait for their food for almost 2 hrs and then have to spend time reheating it--not ok at all! Decent food, poor execution!"}
{"text":"Hands down, the BEST pizza in Vegas.  Family owned and operated.  Real authentic New Yorkers (accents included).  The waitresses are amazing, especially the two Staten Island sisters.  Anthony, the pizza guy from Brooklyn, is pretty hot too.
ORDER THE MEATBALLS- they are unstoppable.

One of the most welcoming places I've eaten at in Vegas.  Great prices, GREAT service, and most of all, GREAT FOOD.  

Go there and ask Anthony to make you a \"Staten Island Slammer\"-- regular pie with ricotta, tomatoes, and and fresh basil-- incredible!"}
{"text":"Let's start with the delivery. This kid shows up at my back door not saying a word or knocking, peering into my house. Then when I appear he gets startled and says \"this isn't your front door?\" Now im left with a feeling of being unsafe cause this kid was scoping out my house on the job!
Got a chicken Caesar salad.. Don't expect Caesar dressing it's just an oil that comes with it, and I don't recommend the lemonade"}
{"text":"I ordered a white pizza with pineapples and wings for delivery.  The pizza was ok, worse than Pizza Hut.  The crust was dry and rubbery,  and only a few pieces of pineapples.  The wings were inedible.  I'm not sure if this is how it usually comes.  But it was soggy, funky smelling , like a mixture of bad oil and seasonings.  It smelled bad from the start, but I thought I'd give it a shot.  I gagged after taking a bite, I had to spit it out.  I would never order from here again.   Anything is better than the less than mediocre pizza and horrific, inedible  wings.   Gas stations wings are better than the wings they serve here.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"An other great place to eat. Pizza by the slice or whole pies. Also gave a full menus of Italian dishes"}
{"text":"They were extremely accommodating, we had a party of 40 people and called them with a 20 minute notice. The service was phenomenal, and the food was even better. Tons of food for a great price. The only thing I would change was that they don't offer pitchers of beer only bottles. We will be back on our next Vegas trip."}
{"text":"The best pizza in town in my opinion. I've been coming here for over 10 years now and it's always the same great, friendly staff and delicious pizza. Their pasta dishes are tasty too, especially the Chicken Tequila (if you like spicy food), and don't let yourself leave without trying the knots."}
{"text":"I do not understand all the glowing reviews.  This is the same gut wrenching, but fairly inexpensive pizza that you get at a lot of places.  Sauce seemed like it was straight from a 5 gallon bucket and the pepperoni is far from fresh cut.  So bland and lifeless.  I didn't feel any love in this pie.  I would not recommend this place unless you are drunk and looking to soak up some beer.  The price is cheap, but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Not what i expect from New York unless you count the attitudes... Pizzas arent bad but not great either. Sauce tastes like its right out of the can and the pizza i last got seemed a bit old.  Dough tasted a bit like cardboard and looked like it was either left in the box way to long or was reheated. Not the first time i have gotten a pizza from here and was hoping for a better second and third attempt but it never happened. I will be looking else where unless they decide to change a few things."}
{"text":"Been coming to NY P and P since 1994. Nothing has changed, and that's a good thing. No frills, down to earth Italian eatery. The pizza is much better if you eat it there, hot and fresh. I live near Mark Riches new york pizza and pasta, and this is not the same place. It's much, much better! Meatball and chicken parm subs are some of the best i've ever had. Just remember..the food will taste twice as good if you sit down and eat it there!"}
{"text":"I give the place a 2 stars specifically for the pizza, everything else gets a 1 from me. Before you even step inside the restaurant, it looks depressing and run down. When you step inside you'll be greeted by a hostess and they'll seat you inside the dining room. When you enter the dining room theres old booths with holes and old looking chairs used in the 90s. 

Our server was quick and attentive, very nice. When we sat down my friends decided we'd get the buffet. I mostly came cause I wanted to try the pasta, I was let down. As I scooped the pasta from the scoop onto the plate it was all oily and cold. not very fresh. I decided to eat it anyway cause I was really hungry, so I sat down and ate it and it was very plastic... Not fresh at all. I took two slices of pizza and it's just standard pizza, nothing special. 

TLDR I honestly could get the same pizza (if not better) at Dominos... just order and you don't even need to come."}
{"text":"Used to be my go to spot but the service has gone down hill. They used to be so friendly and greet you coming in but for whatever reason now just not the same. I alway leave a tip when picking up my dinner but never get a thank you or even eye contact. The food is still ok but plenty of restaurants just like this one so I think I'll try another place......good luck to you."}
{"text":"Stopped in here today for a medium pie, first pizza since I got to Vegas. Great place , reminds me of NY . The pizza was fantastic, just like home, needless to say I will be a regular."}
{"text":"They have wonderful friendly fast service..I ordered for delivery they came on time actually before and my wings was still hot and delicious...the whole order was correct and I am a happy girl"}
{"text":"great pizza great food good prices, good folk eat here it is not fancy just good old school ny pizza joint  there are alot of places in las vegas called ny pizza ONLY EAT AT THIS ONE and you will not regret it"}
{"text":"Sad to say... delivery took FOREVER!! food cold... I'm very disappointed! Philly cheesesteak dry.. asked for extra cheese, that didn't happen! Unfortunately we won't order from them again"}
{"text":"Ordered the works and a meatball sandwich. Bot were tasty and the owners very  ery professional and made great suggestions for food. I will most certainly ly go back when I'm in town again.
Keep up the good work"}
{"text":"If you want large portions at reasonable prices go here.  I ordered a medium ricotta spinach and mozzarella pizza it was crispy on the bottom and gigantic. We have a large order of garlic knots which were perfect and yummy and garlicky and very very reasonable. My husband had the chicken roll and it was over a foot long and tasted just like it does back in New York. We will definitely order from this place again."}
{"text":"Food was good.
Service was even better.  Got that family feel.

Please support this business.  We're happy we stopped in for a meal here.

They are a family run business but they are located quite a ways away from the strip.

UPDATE 1/3/11:  Just get the pizza.  Had a meatball sub which was good but not worth $7 or $8.  My buddy got the pasta.  Not worth $12.  My wife got a mini-pizza and was very satisfied with the pizza quality.

UPDATE 1/5/12:  Secret pizza in the Cosmopolitan Hotel is a lot better.  But also costs a lot more."}
{"text":"They were a place I've been to regularly and rant and raved about it, but they were way off today. We waited for a delivery and received a late call stating that no one answered the door and that the driver had to climb over the fence. We were home all day, being vigilant and waiting. The fence was locked and in no way broken. Do you not know how to open a fence? In past delivers, the fence was locked in a sense that there was a pin in a holder, but past drivers were able to figure out there way in. Not that hard. Received attitude asking if I would be home this time to get the order, ASSUMING that we were lying which we weren't. There is the possibility that they were lying and probably late on delivering the order. We asked why the driver didn't call us, and apparently his phone died, that's the driver's responsibility to have a phone handy. I understand this could happen and I understand the frustration, but there was no need to give attitude to your client that is keeping YOU employed. Never again."}
{"text":"We ordered wings, a loaded pizza, a cheese pizza with tomato and garlic added and knots.  Delivery was 15 minutes sooner than promised.  Nice delivery guy. Great food...fast delivery!  Thank you"}
{"text":"I have probably been to a dozen or so \"NY\" or \"East Coast\" or \"Big Apple\" pizza places here in town and NY Pizza and Pasta is pretty authentic. I may go as far as to say it's the best pizza I've had in town. It's not near my house at all, but worth making the drive. I've had better garlic knots, but I'll give them a free pass on that one. Their sicilian pie is just amazing. They're family owned and run, which also scores big points. I would give 5 stars, but the service while dining in hasn't always been good.

For you other pizza places, NY has hard water too, so stop with that excuse. Turn your ovens up to char the bottom and put some flavor in your sauce."}
{"text":"Okay. So I grew up in Italy and I'm a bit of a pizza snob. I admit it. I also lived in NYC for 15 years so I like to think I know a little bit about the subject. New York Pizza and Pasta is just the ticket to remind you of old New York City pizza parlors. Two slices, and I mean large, flavorful cheesy slices, with plenty of delicious sauce, hit the nail right on the head. Service was quick and a bit brusque but that is what you would get in New York so I actually felt right at home. I'm going back to try some of their other Italian specialties. Well done all around. Thanks for the best pizza I've had on the Westside of town. Bravissimi!"}
{"text":"Gotta give the \"best pizza in Vegas\" award to Jimmie and his family from queens.  I grew up there and moved to California 30 years ago and now I drive over 6 hours 4 times a year to copulate those perfect pies. Order them plain like a true new yorker. Start with the garlic knots and a side of meatballs. If you don't like this place then go to the gun shop next door and eat a bullet, you deserve it."}
{"text":"Trying yet another new spot for delivery options!  A+ for options, and to be fair - none of us actually ordered a pizza, so I'll have to order again and update my review later. Sad part is delivery stops at 8:45pm - so not good for late night cravings.

I had the shrimp scampi that came with pasta --- more like pasta that came with 8 little overcooked shrimp, but it scratched that buttery itch for the most part, although very heavy on the oil factor. Other people got a salad, a sub, and something on a burger bun (sorry, I was hungry and didn't pay enough attention!) 

For an app, someone ordered fried calamari, and although the ticket even said that, they brought us fried mushrooms. One quick phone call, one quick apology, and sent a driver right over with fresh fried calamari (plus we got to keep the mushrooms, which were fried tasty goodness!) --- that my friends is what good delivery service does when someone messes up, and for that, I will happily order from them again (can you tell I've had a bad experience? Read my one star review if you're curious)."}
{"text":"Both of my pizzas were over cooked, bland, and hard like cardboard.  I've had better pizza at little caesars. Seriously. I've microwaved better $0.99 pizzas you buy from smith's. I won't be ordering from here again. The bottom of the pizzas were black. I posted pictures of my brown pizzas. One was pepperoni. The other was sausage and green peppers. They tasted the same: burnt."}
{"text":"While not exactly what you would expect when you think 'New York' style pizza, the flavor will blow most other pizza joints out of the water! Sicilian pizza is great, too. For a family night out, their buffet is perfect-both price and selection are outstanding. Great desserts, fresh and flavorful salads (especially the antipasto) round out this Indian Trail powerhouse."}
{"text":"I've been hearing good things about this place for a while so I thought I would try it out on fight night. It was a take out order so I didn't get the full feel of the restaurant however I will say this, the service I received was excellent and the pizza was great. I'll have to dine in sometime and update this review with that experience. Great job"}
{"text":"Best pizza on the west side of town. Don't know why you would go anywhere else. Only pizza place that I will eat every bit of the crust. After eating I will take home a nice lasagna to have at home for later."}
{"text":"Favorite local pizza place for the taste, quality & price. Not pretentious. Just good classic taste. I love their combo pizza (about $20) with pepperoni, sausage, olives/onions, and we add ricotta. So creamy and perfectly seasonsed. We also ALWAYS get the side of sausage and large order of garlic knots. The real garlic drenching, the awesome marinara sauce and tasty sausage links are worth the trip."}
{"text":"I was visiting a friend that broke his leg, he unfortunately ate before I got to the house but I was drying for some pizza, so after hanging out for a bit I Googled New York pizza by the slice and this was the first place to pop up, normally I would have just ordered a pie from somewhere to have it delivered but since he ate and I was heading home by the slice was going to have to be the plan, I drove here and it's was right on the way home. I pulled up knowing it was kinda a long shot they would have fresh Pizza just under an hour before they close so I went in, at first no one said hello, I felt kinda werid, but then a nice guy Anthony I believe?  Said hello and I asked what they had by the slice, well everything looked like it's been sitting for a little while (it's late) so I was ready to walk out and head somewhere else for something quick, well the guys was super nice and told me I couldn't come in and not get anything, I explained to him that the pizza didn't look as fresh as I'd like, he quickly showed me a fresh pie warmed me up what turned out to be an awesome slice! Glad he made me stay! :) thanks for dinner see you guys again soon!"}
{"text":"I used to eat here for lunch when I worked nearby and loved it. I found them on Grub Hub when I was looking for a Sicilian Pizza that could be delivered to my home. I cannot say enough good things about this restaurant.  The food is delicious.  The food comes on time, piping hot and exactly what I ordered. 
I did live in New York as a young child and know what quality \"New York \" Pizza is...this restaurant is one of the best in town. The Pizza, garlic knots and fingers were all delicious. 
I have no reservations recommending this restaurant.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I ordered a medium pizza and a wing meal w/ fries -
The lady who took my order said it would be an hour wait and it was actually an hour before it came. There are a lot of delivery places like this and I haven't seen it in person, but I will say it was worth the money and the hour wait."}
{"text":"When we come to Vegas, this is our first stop before we check in and before we leave home.  The food here is one of the best Ive ever had.  The staff is nice, pricing is right, and the food speaks for itself.  Definitely recommend if you feel the need for amazing pizza, without the long, loud, Vegas strip.  Come take a time out n enjoy."}
{"text":"I never give restaurants second chances. But I loved the pizza so I gave them THREE. 1st time I ordered they brought me the wrong kind of pizza. 2nd time I ordered salad and a pizza, I only received the salad. 3rd time my order was correct. BUT I work at the Fiat dealership and the delivery man came in and started insulting the cars. I cannot believe how unprofessional this place is. My boyfriend has also ordered before and the woman on the phone wasn't listening to anything he was saying. He had to repeat himself over and over again. So you have to decide if the pizza is worth it, in my opinion it is not."}
{"text":"So glad we took a chance and ate here!!! Such a great selection of food! My husband had pizza and I had the Schwarma Gyro, which I'm pretty certain was served on a hand crafted pita (not out of a plastic bag). OMG!!! To die for!!  We shared the Greek salad and the garlic knots & marinara served prior to dinner-best ever!!!  I wish we could take this place home with us!!! The service could not have been better!  The staff was super friendly!!  Needless to say, my hubs will be eating pizza for breakfast because that was SOOOOOO much food for two!!!"}
{"text":"At work today we placed an enormous order for food from New York Pizza and Pasta. Then some of my coworkers decided to add on two additional orders, and have them all delivered at the same time...
This could have very easily been a disaster. The crew here made it smooth and easy and even had it delivered in just about an hour. Which is impressive for 15 people... 
All the food was fresh and tasty. The garlic knots are deliciously garlicy. The lemon herb chicken entree is so delightful with the perfect amount of herb. The salads here (even the medium) are enourmous! 
Overall lunch was a great value and very tasty. Everyone was pleased and the staff here made it pleasant and smooth.
Blows Napoli's out of the water."}
{"text":"Love their pastas and of course the pizza! The folks who've waited on me have always been very friendly and the service is fairly fast. I've never tried their delivery so I cannot comment on that but their takeout is speedy."}
{"text":"This is a so yummy creative awesomesauce place. The staff is great and delivered to us at The Venetian"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Las Vegas for a true New York style pizza. 
Everything is fresh and amazing."}
{"text":"Not only did it take almost two hours to get my food delivered (Iordered at 10:00 am), but the sandwich was disgusting as was my co workers salad.  Never ever would I order from this place again!"}
{"text":"Very polite attitude with the person who took my order but the delivery guy needs to drop his attitude and leave leave it in the car or house. Coming to my door with mad attitude isn't gonna get you anywhere. Sorry if you feel the need to step and provide me with that rude customer service. 1st ordering here and I'm not impressed.  Not gain"}
{"text":"Great little spot to have authentic New York pizza! Moving from NYC to Las Vegas, this is where I go to satisfy my craving for home. After talking to the owner, I found out this family-run business came from Brooklyn. Talk about a taste from home!

The pizzas have really good crust, crispy on the bottom yet still chewy in the middle, which is hard to do when NY-style pizzas are thin crusted. Their tomato sauce is exactly how NYers like it and it has just the right amount of cheese that you don't need a napkin to blot before you eat.

Their pasta is good too, cooked perfectly al dente, but it is a homemade simple dish, so do not expect it to have fancy flavors and ingredients. It's a truly well-done, simple pasta dish. 

They also have $5 combo specials throughout the day."}
{"text":"My father has been bringing me her since I was a kid. The owners are very welcoming and make me feel like family. They have the best marinara in town!!!! Everything is wonderful! Order the Grandma pizza and you'll be in for a treat!!!"}
{"text":"Best. Pizza. Ever. Perfect new York thin crust super amazingly greasy pizza! All of their food is just too good, but the pizza is a must have!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, amazing staff, and cozy atmosphere. They serve the BEST garlic knots and calzone I have ever tasted! I want to try other things on the menu but I can't seem to stray from the amazing calzone."}
{"text":"Not the same quality as when I dined here 
This is second time I ordered for delivery 
Looks like they slap everything together 
Also asked for well done it's not 
Unfortunately my first visit was fantastic 
You can look at my previous check in 
Maybe the person that makes pizza for delivery is different 
 So sad cause it was so good while dinning there and today for delivery not good and last time delivery not food nice and crispy at the crust and taste uncooked in the middle"}
{"text":"I still love coming here. Every time we are here, we love it and leave too full! It doesn't look like much, but the service is always friendly, the food so filling and the flavors exploding!"}
{"text":"HIGHLY recommended. Have gone there for many many years. Delicious pizza, delicious, garlic knots and fries are delicious. When Anthony's throwing the dough, you know your dinners going to be delicious. We love the family, we love the service, we love the atmosphere and all the good people that we've met there."}
{"text":"We've been customers for years, and have referred them to many of our friends. Tonight, we were craving their pizza so we placed an order for their special of 2 large pizzas with 1 topping each and a bottle of soda. We live too far for delivery so we have to drive the distance, but for their pizza it's worth it. Or so we thought. My mom went to go get the pizzas which we ordered 1 with mushrooms and 1 with sausage. She gets home and we're starving can't wait to dig in. Go to open them and they're both mushroom pizzas. It's too long of a drive for us to go back and why waste our gas for their mistake. So we call them up and she says she can give us a credit of $7. $7?!? The 2 pizzas with a bottle of sodas came to over $30. What school did this chick go to to even think that a $7 credit was worth what we paid for. Unbelievable. So we tell her we'll just take the pizza we originally paid for and for the inconvenience they were going to deliver it even though we are out of the radius. It was at this moment that they just lost us forever. She had the NERVE to ask for the wrong pizza back. She told us they would deliver our right one if we can give the wrong one back. Ok, so what are they going to do with the messed up pizza? Throw it away? Try to RE SELL it to someone else? She could have just let us keep it for the inconvenience. That just completely turned us off. It was very unsanitary to even consider taking it back, and makes you think if they're gonna try to resell it to another customer. We will never be going back here after we've been coming here for over 6 years. Disgusting. And their pizza has gotten way worse. Not the same taste or quality."}
{"text":"Food was delicious,an great option is having our food delivered to our home after a long day at work. We definitely looking forward to ordering again.


We had chicken wings,chefs salad , pizza is definitely delicious!"}
{"text":"When you go to the register there's a printed sign in the back that says \"We only speak New York here.\" If that's a good thing or not I'm not sure? What I can tell you is the pizza I had was an authentic N.Y. Slice. This makes me happy because that's a hard thing to do. The sauce was the right flavor and the cheese was the right flavor and correct ratio. So, get a slice and \"fogedaboud'it.\""}
{"text":"Best pizza in Vegas. Love the NY thin! Getting hungry thinking about it. Anthony keep on cooking. I've  been in Vegas 25 years. Other pizzas places have simar names, this one's on Jones Blvd."}
{"text":"We order from this place SO much. It's clearly a family owned restaurant. Everything from the pasta and pizzas or the hot subs and cold sandwiches; it has never disappointed. Their customer service is through the roof. Delivery can be a bit slow sometimes but that's because they get slammed. If anything is ever wrong with your order (accidents happen) they have always either replaced it completely or gave me a credit for next time. Amazing people. 5/3/16."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza for Vegas, definitely liked their Sicilian pizza better than the thin crust though, just wish it was a bit closer!"}
{"text":"One of the best pizza's in Las Vegas.  It's the closest to NY pizza on the West coast there is.  Take it from a New Yorker and a self proclaimed Pizza Snob.  It is crunchy with just the right amount of sauce/cheese ratio.  You know that it's a great pie when you do NOT have to add anything on the pizza.  Just a cheese pizza and if it's good, you know it's good.  This place makes one of the best Pizza's in town!  The garlic knots are also amazing and with marinara, magnifico!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I haven't tried the pizza but the food is excellent. I especially love their baked clams. The portions are big and I usually have to take some home. It's not a fancy place  it looks and smells like a New York pizzeria. As soon as I walk in the delicious aroma gets my juicces flowing. I wish I lived closer I would be there very often."}
{"text":"The food is great. The service is terrible, over the phone of course.  Also they can never get the order right. Still don't know if it's worth it."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! The owners and atmosphere is like a New York attitude which you got to love. First time eating here about 5 years ago just by reading reviews from yahoo trying to find a good New York style pizza. Once you walk into this local spot of a hang out you see how everyone feels so comfortable.  In one corner you have family/friends enjoying their time laughing and catching up on gossip and in another you see a regular come in and sit down at his usual spot. And at this particular time the wife and I came in to try it out the place it felt like we've been there before by just the way we were greeted and the whole atmosphere. The waitress was great she kept ending her questions for us with \"doll\". And when we told her this was our first time there she asked, you wanting pizza...yes, slice or pie...pie, a lot on it...yes, then you'll like \"The Works\". After that...the rest is history. After meeting Anthony and Jimmy you feel like your apart of the place. Anthony has such a regular following for the way he makes his pizza he'll even half bake and not slice it so you can enjoy it hot when you get home. Thus, everytime I come into Vegas I stop off there to eat and when I leave to head back to Cali I get my half bake for the trip home as well as an order of garlic knots(so so good if you love a lot of garlic) for the drive. Oh and if Anthony is working don't ask for ranch dressing for his pies haha."}
{"text":"A gem of a place in this town. The food here is authentic and amazing. You can feel the genuine love and care the kitchen puts in true New York Italian food. The pizza is just ridiculous, but don't pass on the rest of the menu. It's excellent. 

As far as the place itself goes...it reminds you of an old food spot from the old neighborhoods in New York. Take it all in for what it is: uniquely New York in Vegas"}
{"text":"Stopped by this place to pick up some takeout pizza while in Las Vegas for ultimate frisbee. Had a 14in 1/2 and 1/2 pineapple/ham and garlic/tomato. Also ordered some garlic knots on the suggestion of the lady working there. And got 3 cannolis as well. 
The people working there are so nice, and seem to be from New York. There were a couple of New Yorkers eating pizza there when I walked in to place my order, and they were conversing with the employees. Pretty cool if you ask me. 

The food was tasty, the pizza perfect, and the garlic knots were good. I have had better cannolis, but no complaints about this one. The lady was nice and ordered me a drink of my choice while I waited for y food. The staff there seem to get along really well.  

There are many specials and they also have a rewards program. If I lived in the area, I would totally be a regular here. Supporting local businesses who do right by their customers is always a good decision. 

The only thing I would have done differently was to either order two whole pizzas instead of a half half, or order the 16 inch instead of 14 inch. 


Thanks for a great pizza. Will stop by on my next visit."}
{"text":"We used this place to Cater a recent event and it was an absolute hit! The Pasta Donna was loved by our vegetarian/Vegan friends and the chicken parm, meatballs, and garlic knots were scrumptious.   They were are also very well priced and gave us the utensils, delivery and set up for free!  Best deal ever!"}
{"text":"I was scared of ordering online and was not disappointed.  Had a mini pizza and the crust had just the right crisp and sauce. Pizza like I never had before and was not greasy. I also had some dessert but it didn't taste like anything special. I will be ordering here again."}
{"text":"We ordered from here yesterday for an impromptu pizza party for one of my coworkers! The pizza and cannolis were delicious. I recommend trying their sausage + onion + pepper pizza. A bit on the greasier side, but that's a-okay with me. Unfortunately had to knock a couple stars off because it took an hour and a half to deliver it despite being right down the street..."}
{"text":"The regular calzone was huge. It could have been warmer, but it was good. 

The cheesecake was small. It could was frozen solid. 

Opposite problems for opposite foods... but still very happy"}
{"text":"New York Pizza and Pasta had the best pizza I've eaten in Las Vegas, bar none! The people are also very friendly too. They seem to know nearly everyone who comes in, indicating there are many regulars. My son and I ordered a combination with Sicilian crust. I'll drive back for more, even though it's out of my way. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Had a craving for pizza . Rare occasion for me. Of course 1st thing I do is check with yelp. This place had good rating and Everyone seem to like it. Ok I get on my car drove here.  Place looks run down. Kind of didn't wanna go inside.  But they got good reviews so we went in.
FIRST IMPRESSION:  WE WALKED IN NOBODY ACKOWLEDGED US. WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.  WE FINALLY ASKED A WOMAN \" DO WE SEAT OURSELVES?\" SHE SAYS \"YES\" BUT THE GUY NEXT TO HER SAYS \"WE WILL COME TO YOU JUST GRAB A SEAT\"  ??????? Lol.  people working here are confused. Free garlic knots is good. It was drenched in olive oil.   Fresh and hot with plenty of garlic to chase any vampires away. The dipping sauce was good as well. Definately not out of a can.  As far as the pizza goes. It was below average for me.  Crust tasted like crackers.  So dry and tasted like frozen dough. Cheese and pepperoni had no flavors. I am so disappointed. I was expecting some good grub :((((("}
{"text":"Some friends from New York invited us out for dinner here. We were greeted by the owner Jimmy who later joined us at the table where he invited us to share some fresh mozzarella. 

We ordered a large The Works pizza. A white pizza which was amazing. A cheese calzone that could have been desert and a couple of Caesar salads with fresh anchovies.

The food was awesome and not greasy. In my opinion most pizzarias use skim cheese and when you use cheese that is the real deal, there should be some runoff.

Will be going back very soon."}
{"text":"No question about it. New York Pizza and Pasta is the only place in Las Vegas that resembles a New York pizzeria and New York pizza. The pizza is delicious, just the way pizza is supposed to be. Their meatballs, eggplant parmigiana, lasagna, and marinara sauce are made from scratch, and couldn't be any better. Their regular pizza, white pie, and sicilian are hard to resist."}
{"text":"They have the best pizza that's about as true New York pizza as you can find this far west! Their garlic knots are to die for and definitely the best I've ever had! I've been a regular here for years and will continue to be for many more to come!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Vegas. Ordered delivery cant wait to dine in. Love that they are not shy when it comes to garlic!!! Yum!"}
{"text":"If you like New York Style Pizza this is a great place. 
Great family restaurant. Casual , friendly with awesome pizza. Garlic knots are nice and garlicky just like they should be. Marinara sauce tastes good. 
Bring the family and enjoy a comfortable environment with good food."}
{"text":"This is exactly what a New York pizza is supposed to taste like. Just ordered a pepperoni pie for lunch takeout and it was perfect and scrumptious. Definitely going back when I have NYC cravings."}
{"text":"I concur with the reviewer below, best pizza in Las Vegas.  In my experiences, it's second only to Mozza Pizzeria in Los Angeles.  Extra crispy is the way to go with New York Pizza & Pasta."}
{"text":"REAL NY thin crust pizza... c'mon now they even have the brooklyn accent!  This is the spot for crispity crunchity pizza.  No frills no thrills pizzeria with a full menu, don't let the decor fool you and the ranch dressing is housemade...delicious!
I usually ask for the pizza to be in the oven a few extra minutes for super crisp crust!  just get down there and try some!!!  You'll like it! maybe even LUV it....I do!

I LUV NY pizza!!!!!!!!!!

Ciao"}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time. Delivery was prompt and friendly. Sausage and pepperoni pizza was delicious! Will do this again for sure!!"}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp for helping me find a place that was open for delivery on Sunday night.  I haven't dined here, yet, and I don't even think I've heard of it.  Wasn't in the mood for pizza so I ordered a greek salad and a meatball sub.  Greek salad was good, but was missing pepperocinis and red onions.  Meatball sub was above average.

Oh yeah, we got garlic knots due to all of the positive recommendations, and I'm glad we did.  They were awesome.

Delivery dude forgot to bring a pen even though I ordered via credit card.  How does that always happen?  You know you're going to need me to sign it, dude.  Sigh, I still tipped him good anyways."}
{"text":"Love their pizza. So cheesy and thin. Perfect for that pizza craving! 

I gave them 4 stars because I wish they would change their chicken! We love to order pizza and chicken fingers but won't again from here! They were supposed to be in mild wing sauce but had no sauce or flavor. The worst part is the chicken itself. Over processed chopped and formed style nuggets is how I would describe them not a tender, juicy 100% chicken tender like you would get elsewhere. 

I hope they switch to real chicken soon!!"}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years...never a bad meal....servIce is great too.   Beware Friday and Saturdays can get pretty busy...never a wait, just busy.
Pizza is great, a nice thin crisp crust...the calzones are to die for...love the Cavatelli and baked ziti entrees, too.  I've had their special 'rolls' and they are yummy, to say the least!  Can't go wrong for the price and you can easily split them.  
You can't go wrong choosing NY pizza and Pasta...oh and free garlic knots when you dine in?!  It's awesome! 
Tip: Try the Spumoni Cake!  It's crazy good!"}
{"text":"We've ordered their pizza before and they have the best. If you dine in you can watch them toss the dough and cook your pizza right there. Friendly family run business. Today we ordered their pastas for delivery and it was great! The pasta was cooked perfect, ingredients tasted fresh, delivery was sooner then quoted and food was hot. Also got the garlic knots which is a must and their cannoli's delish! Perfect end to our heavy meal. The cannoli's are individual size so if you have to share or want more then just 1 (which u will) order extra :) this place is definitely worth the lil bit of extra $ over the big chain pizza guys (Pizza Hut, dominoes) you get 100x better food and service!"}
{"text":"Chicken part had barely a drop of sauce on it . 
The pizza was pretty good.  Ny style , very thin.  But I didn't like the crust.  
It was almost non existent.  But the pizza was better then most delivery"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have been searching for a pizza spot to satisfy our crave. Looked on Yelp and came across this establishment. Our experience here was 10/10. The food was of course a highlight, but the main surprise we faced came from our waitress, \"Sherryl\" (sorry if I spelled it wrong). She was able to cater to our needs and was a pleasant woman to converse with. She definitely made our experience. I recommend this place to anyone looking for NY style pizza or to anyone looking to just have a great time for dinner. 

Recommendations: 
Mussels w pasta
Garlic knots
Slice or box of pie (the portions are huge)
Canoles"}
{"text":"We've been wanting to come here a while. When I find out they had baked clams, we had to come. Alot of people were just hanging out, having a good time. Food was very good it reminded us of NY. The portions are huge so we wound up taking stuff home. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Jimmy and family are great! And so is the pizza, we were doing a little work on our Veterans home and he was happy to provide lunch for the guys and gals, much appreciated. So being that he is from NY i told him how the fire dept. performs CPR back east \"Get the F*** up or you are gonna die. Well that's my east coast firefighters joke. Anyway great pizza, fair price. Semper Fi"}
{"text":"My friend took me here for my belated birthday and I've been craving their pizza and wings ever since. Service is good and food is good. Reminds me of Nikki Lee's Bar but smaller pizza size."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza and staff.  My regular pizza place was closed on Monday???  So I tried this spot and I have now changed my regular spot to this place.  It was amazing pizza!  Some of the reviews complain the pizza is greasy, and yes it is but.....newsflash..... IT'S PIZZA!!!  It's suppose to be greasy!  It's also full of flavor, cheese and spices.  So good!!!  U gotta try this place.  It might just become your new favorite.
The staff is also amazing.  Met the owner and I think his wife and they are down to earth and friendly.  The cashier was pleasant and helpful.  Try this place....you'll thank me later!"}
{"text":"Really good pizza, excellent staff & an overall great experience.
I took the family here for a meal to take back to the hotel & was very glad I did.
Even my ultra-picky 2 yr old scarfed this stuff down.
It's a no brainer... If you want great pizza &?garlic rolls... This is the spot to hit... We loved it!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't come here for pizza, because the pizza is not NY style and didn't look that great from what I saw available on the buffet. However, I will definitely return here for the calzones and stromboli. They offer one of the best calzones I've ever had, with a slightly crispy crust. Not heavy or greasy. Try the house special - pepperoni, sausage, mushroom, and onion - with mozzarella and ricotta. Only $6.49. Lunch service was speedy and attentive."}
{"text":"Love this place for authentic east coast pizza (translation...foldable and greasy!), hearty NY style subs (meatball parm is to die for) & huge portion pasta dishes.   

Super casual environment!!  The right side is a walk up counter you can order take out and the left side is a seated dining room option with booths and tables.   There's also a big room off the dining room that looks like it would be good for semi-private large parties/meetings.   

They serve beer & wine....great prices ($3.50 for Peroni!).  Food prices are ok....expected it to be a little cheaper.  Average entree price is $13-ish (includes salad & garlic bread).  

Family owned and everybody treats you like they've known you forever."}
{"text":"Decided to try based on reviews. Opted for the buffet $8.49 for Veggie, Meats, Cheese, Pepperoni, and Apple Pie Pizza selection. Salad, breadsticks, and pasta with marinara were also offered on the buffet. To sum it up it tasted to the equivalency of Golden Coral pizza day. Not sure why so many pizza joints are able to claim they are serving NEW YORK style pizza! This is definitely not true authentic NY pizza, no where near. The food was just ok that's it."}
{"text":"Finally, a pizza place w/good customer service and food - usually it's one or the other, rarely both.  I was originally going to order from another place but they didn't have salad. So I found New York Pizza & Pasta on Yelp and happy that I did.  First thing, there's a lady named Joyce who answers the phone - she said she doesn't work there but I can't believe that because she knew everything about the menu and helped me order the right amount and type of pizzas - she even threw in sodas just because!  

The pizza had flavor, crispy crust, and arrived hot.  Much much better than the other place I was going to order from.  Also - they have a huge menu selection (carb friendly items) and fast delivery - the rush order of 9 pizzas was delivered before time! Can't beat that, this will be the new place for our pizza lunches :)"}
{"text":"Ideal spot to get NY style pizza. I was very pleased with the pizza, the sauce...you name it. It feels like you're in a Sopranos episode. I took a star off for ambiance. I prefer it to look cleaner but maybe that's why this place is so authentic.

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is probably some of the best pizza I've had in quite sometime. Fast, priced great, and amazing. Their jumbo fingers are the definition of jumbo, juicy, tons of meat and just enough breading. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"For the second time my \"mini\" garlic knots came burnt amd swimming in oil. My pizza arrived cold and late ( 1 hour ).  I don't understand how the garlic knots even made it out the door. Terrible."}
{"text":"Food was bad order was wrong, but it came on time so the driver was at least on point."}
{"text":"This is NOT New York pizza or pasta. It is about the same quality as Cici's, if not worse. The pizza was very bad and bland, but edible if you are starving. Pasta was not edible at all. I should mention that the pasta options were penne with either completely flavorless marinara, or with oil and tons of gigantic chunks of garlic. Restaurant was very cramped, even though it was empty. There was one other table, and we were seated in the smallest little booth I've ever seen. Very cheap and tacky looking. The \"buffet\" was two small pizzas, and two small containers of penne. Everything looked like it was from about 1970 or so. I think the buffet is only around $5, but it's not even worth that."}
{"text":"I love this place! Everyone is really friendly and their food is amazing.
Everything at the buffet is delicious and fresh. I also looooooooove their calzones."}
{"text":"Looked on Yelp for a good pizza place and beer. NY Pizza popped up. Never tried a NY style pizza, so I have nothing to compare it to.

The pizza crust was thin and crunchy. The sauce wasn't tomato-y and the there was lots of cheese. It was so good. 

If this is what NY pizza tastes like, I'm gonna love it!"}
{"text":"As a Native Yorker, I always struggle with finding descent pizza spots in NC.  NYPP was definitely good, as well as they're wings.  Nice atmosphere and they have a good buffet for those who prefer a variety of choices.... Remember folks, finding NY pizza in NC will be a challenge.... Operative word, NY, this is NC..."}
{"text":"Authenticate New York flavor! The price is good. Slices are flavorful. Garlic knots are very garlicky but I like that. And the customer service was amazing. I've been here 3 times in 1 week, so I'd say I like it!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and wings,  I have eating here several times and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Was in town visiting an old friend and he took me to get a real New York slice. The service was so great. I felt like I was in New York not Vegas. Anthony brought us a smoking hot pie fresh out of the oven. Sooooo good."}
{"text":"The pizza, garlic knots, & marinara sauce all taste great.

I do not like how they just heat up pepperonis or sausages & just throw them on a slice of cheese pizza if you order just individual slices.. It doesn't taste the same as a fresh pie.

I would advise just getting a whole pizza & saving the leftovers for later.

The service is great & the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Just moved to las Vegas and decided to use yelp to find a great pizza place. Based on the reviews I stopped in and was not disappointed!! 

OMG the NY thin crust pizza is delish! My boyfriend and i had pepperoni and sausage. The sausage was shaved slices that look just like gyro strips. Perfect flavors and no gritty fennel seeds in the sausage which made my day lol.

 This seems like a nice family owned establishment and they are all very friendly. 

Garlic knots were yummy with a crunchy exterior and a soft inside. Served with a side of heated marinara sauce. 

All in all a wonderful find!! We will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"Love the garlic knots, meatball pizza, ranch, marinara sauce....friendly, personable. Entree prices, if you don't order a special, are high. Let's see what I get volume wise. It's an old school NY place with character, in my opinion. I'll be back."}
{"text":"After reading all the rave reviews of this place I decided to trust my fellow yelpers and give it a go.

Real NY pizza in Las Vegas? It couldn't be! 

I ordered a Large 2-topping delivered $20-Beef & Mushroom. Thin & crispy crust with nice sauce & REAL toppings. Damn Tasty!

Never been to NY so I can't compare but it was just they way I ike it.

Thanks Yelp!"}
{"text":"I dig the place and the family that owns the business. Friendly and awesome service. I don't think anyone in Vegas can touch the prices they have for 2 single topping gigantic pies with a pitcher of soda for around $25. The free garlic knots are really good. Been to New York couple times and this is like eating there. This place is not fancy. Just tables and chairs. But the attentiveness and friendliness is what makes this place a good place to go on a casual evening without breaking the bank. I'm not kidding when I say that with the two pies we still ended up taking home about a 3/4 pie."}
{"text":"Every time I need a good slice of New York, this is the spot I have to visit. Walk in, seat yourself, and yell across the restaurant to all the cooks because they're all awesome!

Been here many times to give myself a nice reality check and get some great food. Everything made fresh to order with some extra \"streets of New York\" love. Pizza is always fantastic! Crispy crust, not too much sauce, and always the perfect amount of cheese. 

The service here takes you into a world of legitimate care. People that aren't fake, but really want to make sure you are comfortable and full...Just like mom. I love this place. Great food and great service. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Vegas hands down.  Taste just like NY Pizza and everyone is so helpful and nice."}
{"text":"Bad service !! Ordered online 45min prior to driving to place and they had no clue about my order and forgot to put it in ! Bad costumer service ! Decided on just canceling order !"}
{"text":"Great lunch specials. I always get the 2 slices and a drink. Nice and chewy NY style crust."}
{"text":"It was the Fourth of July and after some day drinking and loads of grilling out my boo and I were in the mood for pizza. We placed a delivery order and it arrived right on time, hot and fresh! 

We shared a large pepperoni pizza and some garlic knots. The pizza was good in flavor, but a little too greasy for my liking. I'd give it a 3/5. The garlic knots though were fantastic! They did not skimp on the fresh garlic at all and the sauce on the side was excellent. These I'd give a 5/5. 

I'd definitely order from here again and am excited to try some other options besides pizza."}
{"text":"The pizza was scrumptious! You can tell they use high quality ingredients! From the cheese to the delicious dough and pizza sauce! Yummm! I would have given 5 stars, but the person I placed my order with could of been a lot MORE PATIENT! It just sounded like he was trying to rush me off the phone. Had he not, I probably would've ordered more. Oh and I had to give my card number to the delivery driver cause the guy I gave it to on the phone when I placed my order, didn't get it or whatever...also it would be nice if he didn't repeat my card number as I gave it to him...made me a little bit uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Have enjoyed the pizzas here on periodic visits to the neighborhood. Take out or eat-in, it's a good bet. Solid, thin crust NY style. 

But on a recent visit, we ate in and tried some other things. The chicken parm is good and HUGE. Plan to share that and you may still end up bringing some home. Crispy, crunchy and hearty with a tasty marinara. Comes with a smal house salad -- crisp head lettuce with tomato and cucumber. It's even a kid-friendly salad, I discovered. The garlic bread that also accompanies the dish was perfectly cooked and crispy. There was maybe a flavor of margarine (?) about it, though, which I didn't love.

Can't beat the Garlic Knots. Olive oil, garlic and crunchy spheres of carb goodness. Mmm.

The gal who was our server has been there for years, and is very nice. This time, I even met Jimmy, the owner -- a very nice guy who likes to kibbitz with his friends, his customers. It's a nice and homey scene, really.

I keep meaning to save room for dessert, but haven't quite learned my lesson !"}
{"text":"Favorite place to get a slice of New York style pizza.  It has to be one of two spots in Vegas that I know that has pizza close to real NY pizza with a NY feel."}
{"text":"I'm eating their regular cheese pizza right now.  A coworker wanted me to compare it to Broadway Pizzeria, and here's the difference I taste.  The dough and crust on this pizza is phenomenal.  Lightly crunchy on the very outside, fluffy on the inside, chewy but not doughy.  The pizza is wholly delicious.  I can't say it's better than Broadway's.  They're both amazing.  I might like the cheese and sauce combination of Broadway's pizza more, but the overall pizza slice of this restaurant I think I may like better.  This pizza seems to have more dimensions without losing any of the east coast.."}
{"text":"Only submitting this update since my previous review is now out of date regarding pricing (that was 2009!).  Anyway, New York Pizza & Pasta is still our favorite pizza in the area -by far- but they have had to raise their prices to accommodate for the increases in small business operational expenses that have happened since the Affordable Care Act. Plan on spending ~$30 for a couple large pizzas. Not cheap, but they are still our favorite even though we aren't able to get them as often as we did.  The staff is always very friendly, and it's nice if you're a \"regular\" that they remember your name."}
{"text":"The pizza is consistently good.  I asked what deals they had for a large pizza and 1/2 bucket.  What they ended up giving me was a medium pizza and 1/2 bucket.  The price was within $1 had I ordered the large and wings separately.  Also, they are a Pepsi joint, not a Coke one.  Had I gotten the large pizza they probably would have gotten 4 stars."}
{"text":"Dropping into this unassuming strip-mall restaurant on a Friday night, we found one heck of a crowd.  I mean they were absolutely slammed.  Khan's, which is just a couple of doors down, had almost no one inside.  So I either the food was great, Khan's is bad, or some combination of both.

We've been to Khan's, and the food there isn't bad at all, so we didn't know what to expect.  What we did know is that NYPP, as the server's shirts proudly proclaimed, was absolutely hopping.  So we decided to stay.  Somewhat surprisingly, we found a table without so much as a wait.  I guess everyone moved fast enough that it just worked out that way.

While they offer a menu, and they seem to offer delivery as well, the attraction at New York Pizza and Pasta is definitely their buffet.  Spread out in a corner of the lobby area, it holds four or five pizzas of varying toppings, some form of breadsticks (often stuffed), a couple varieties of pasta, and a healthy salad bar.

What it doesn't offer, unlike many pizza buffets, is a dessert selection.  It's not that they don't have a dessert offering there - they do.  But it doesn't come on the buffet.  You have to buy it separately, and it's under the counter up front.  The servers don't really offer it, even if you ask.  It's like you pick it up on the way out.  So it's like they just don't want to sell it, which is a little odd.

As to the food itself, very tasty.  The cheese and the sausage and onion pizzas were excellent.  The others were good, but a bit heavy for my taste.  The pasta was good, and I have to admit that I didn't even try the salad.  But I did have plenty of the pizza.  Yum."}
{"text":"This place has delicious food and very friendly service. From the souce on the pizza to the awesome hot wings. We are from Orange County but will definitely come again. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I have been here for lunch several times. All the servers are nice. Nice selection for your salad. They have Stromboli on the buffet and it's so good! Pizza is also delicious. My favorite is the veggie. They also have pasta. My favorite is the penne with garlic. It is so flavorful!"}
{"text":"This place is good.  Sort of disappointing when you first look at it, décor is that of a take-out pizza joint (which this place is).  But the staff is very accommodating (sometimes not well organized) and the food is quite good with the prices very reasonable.  We felt like we were \"friends\" the first time we ate there, and have been back every week since.  Definitely an owner-operator, family business -- you know they want you to come back.  Too bad we don't live closer."}
{"text":"The other night after picking my kid up from day care and too tired to cook, I decided that I wanted pizza and was curious to try NYP&P.  Since that evening, I've been back a second time because the pizza is pretty good.  They serve large slices, have fresh toppings, great sauce - not what you'd expect from a strip plaza in Indian Trail.  

BUT don't forget that half of New Jersey and New York live now live in Union County and they're opening some pretty fabulous restaurants.  

A big surprise are the deserts.  For $3, you can have a monster slice of cake or cheesecake and both are delish.  There's even a buffet for lunch or dinner.  

I think what I like most about this place is that it's a great place to just enjoy a slice, enjoy talking with friends, without the distractions of a million tv's."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place and was hoping it would be my go to pizza spot for a fellow new Yorker but sadly that is not the case.  The lunch combo was well price but I did not enjoy their pizza at all.   The cheese literally falls off the slice when you pick it up on any type of angle.. The whole time it kept running off the dough I had to eat  the discarded cheese with a fork.  Also the place could use a facelift perhaps but that didn't place into my review.  I would gladly visit a dive pizza dump that had standing room only if it had awesome slices."}
{"text":"How did I not know that this place existed??? 

Tucked away in the small plaza at the corner of Jones and Sahara it's an unassuming store front location. 

The environment is definitely older. You can tell that the building has been there a while. It comes off as run down. Do not let looks deceive and don't judge a book by its cover!!

Everyone I interacted with was super friendly and upbeat. Service with a smile, love it. 

I ordered the veggie pizza. In my opinion, some of the best pizza I have had in a long time. Pizza is thin and crispy. Most importantly the pizza wasn't greasy. I also ordered a salad which consisted of fresh ingredients, lettuce, bell peppers, mushrooms, red onions, yum!

Loved loved loved the food and service here.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best pizza anywhere. San Francisco, Las Vegas, LA anywhere. Pasta is great too. Been eating here for 25 years. Classic pizza."}
{"text":"Ive never had to give a negative review for anything before, but here it goes. Delivey took 70 minutes, they forgot the soda, and the pizza was hardly lukewarm when it was delivered. The delivery guy offered to go to the corner store and bring back a soda, but by that point I was ready to just forget about it!"}
{"text":"My office is five minutes away from this pizza joint, and given the prior Yelp reviews, I decided to give this place a try. 

The first time I ordered from here, I ordered the Italian wedding soup. The soup was filled with little meatballs, which I thought were delicious! The soup came with this toasted garlic bread of some sort. It was hard and oily. I threw it out after one bite. 

Then I ordered the lunch special with one slice of cheese pizza and salad. Meh, Cugino's on Maryland Parkway is better. I will definitely come back just because it is close, but not because they have the best New York style pizza. 

I guess I still have to try the pasta. Good luck!"}
{"text":"I have had their pizza 3 times now and I love it. Today I got pepperoni and garlic, and an order of chicken fingers. The fingers were eh, the sauce tasted just like tomato soup. But this place isn't known for the chicken fingers and sauce. It's all about that pizza. I certainly didn't want to share any of it."}
{"text":"I've had them cater an event...fantastic!
I've eaten in their restaurant...also fantastic
And now, I've had them deliver a pizza and have experienced the trifecta!

I've already yelped the other two experiences, so for the pizza. The delivery took a huge amount of time. Granted, it was on a Friday night. The pie is traditional New York style and it arrived hot. Not \"fresh out of the oven hot\"...but way hotter than \"it's been sitting in the delivery guys car forgotten forever\" We had two, a pepperoni and a vegetable...and never go without a side of knots when you have the chance! They have become my pizza delivery of choice. I can easily handle the wait as the pizza is worth it (and then some). Just plan a little in advance, and all is good."}
{"text":"We went for dinner.  After looking at the menu we opted for the buffet.  Salad bar was good.  Pizza was hot. Dessert was tasty and they had simple noodles with butter garlic and oil that we liked. $8.50 for buffet is good price too. Try it."}
{"text":"Just passing through Vegas and didn't want to go to the strip for food so we found this place! Very friendly staff and absolutely delicious food! I got the lasagna and it tastes like homemade and the serving size was quite large. My husband got the individual calzone and it was huge! He also liked it."}
{"text":"Pizza here truly taste like NY pizza, place could  use some new furniture, staff is nice. Can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"Wifey and I had pizza. Pepperoni and jalapeño and pepperoni and sausage. DELICIOUS! I would def recommend. About 11$ for 2 slices total seemed a bit harsh but it's delicious and its Vegas. Way better than chipotle and panda right next door"}
{"text":"When we first ordered from this place, there is no doubt it's the best pizza close to NY pizza that you can find! The wings aren't so bad and not so good either. Based on that experience, we did order again today, pizza is still good! This time we had pepperoni rather than our usual cheese. Along with the pizza, we did order some spaghetti and meatballs which is good as well and some cheese ravioli's with MEAT SAUCE which tastes good and to my liking except it came with MARINARA SAUCE :( all in all, the pizza is good. Just hope they delivered the right order."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Driver forgot my condiments/ranch. The driver ended up coming back to deliver said items quickly. Good business practice; will order again."}
{"text":"The quality of Italian food served here is top notch.  Everything from the garlic knots to the shrimp  fettuccine is fresh and full of flavor.  Every time I come back to Vegas to visit, I stop by this neighborhood gem.  The people that work here are nice and make things to order.  I will certainly return."}
{"text":"BRIAN IS BACK MAKING PIES!!!!!...... This really is a great pizza.... dough nicely cooked and LOTS OF FRESH GARLIC.... NICE SAUCE! next time I'll order it with extra sauce..... Jimmy and Laura , the owners make me and my wife feel like we're at home there..... I'll be back......that's a given......THANKS JIMMY!!!!!!!!!! And thanks Brian......... IMHO.... THE BEST GARLIC/PEPPERONI PIE IN TOWN!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is kind of hidden but worth finding. It's really got the best pizza in Las Vegas. Great food and friendly service. We will definitely be returning and bringing family and friends in the future. Loved it."}
{"text":"Love the authentic New York style pizza. The staff is always friendly and the service is fast. Have never been let down on our many visits here."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious pizza! We always eat here when we are visiting and we are never let down by the excellent food and service. Try the Shrimp Rosa it's out of this world!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant. Every time I go to Alessandra, she is the best server. Great pizza and great customer service! Thank you Alessandra :)"}
{"text":"Still working my way through the menu, but everything so far has been great. The knots are unbeatable and the pizza is pretty \"close\", if you know what I mean. Plus, they are definitely from NY, so they know what they're doing in there! I can't wait to try the Sicilian, which I haven't had since I lived in Queens (five years ago!). I always get sausage on my thin-crust and it's actually sliced thin, not little crumbles. So good. The mini pie with two toppings for $7 and change is more than enough for me. 

Are they the friendliest bunch? Not always, but do you really care? I may be showing my New York, but just give me my pizza and send me on my way. This is a hole-in-the-wall mostly meant for takeout or delivery, not a five-star steakhouse. Come for the pizza, not the freaking ambiance.

I'd recommend picking up a copy of the menu and calling in your order. For one, there's a $1 delivery fee through Eat24 while their printed menu says it's free. I've only ever paid for a delivery when ordering online, so keep it in mind. Also, when ordering online, sometimes special instructions/substitutions don't print out correctly on their end."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of the buffet style but that is a portion of this restaurant and it is reasonably priced with salad, pasta and pizza. They also have a full menu of Italian items that are good.  

The place is clean, service is quick and the wait staff is friendly. It is a store front restaurant, no frills, parking lot and casual dress."}
{"text":"It's like walking into a scene from Goodfellas. Very back east. Great marinara. The mussels are my favorite. I like them spicy. 

The owner is a real character. Long time Las Vegas but every bit still a New Yorker.  I don't love the salads but all the classic pizza joint and Italian fair are great. Priced right for the neighborhood and the casual decor. Definitely not fancy but definitely good food."}
{"text":"BEWARE !!!!!!

I ordered through Grubhub and specified ALL DRUMSTICKS and CRISPY FRIES. I ordered a kids slice which comes with fries and a coke. And 10 wings and fries again ALL DRUMSTICKS. I received a cold slice, UNDERCOOKED FRIES, more wings than drumsticks. So I called the restaurant and the lady who answered refused to listen and copped one serious attitude. I asked for a manager and she said there wasn't one. When I raised my voice she put me on hold. I waited for some time and like magic.....a manager who said they don't do all drums. I told him you should have contacted me to let me know so I could have canceled my order. He promised a refund but hung up before he specified for what and how much. I undersrand you may be really busy but that is no excuse to be dismissive of paying customers. Now I have crappy food in my trash can and I want ALL my money back. No excuses ALL my money"}
{"text":"Lady on phone taking my order so sweet. Delivered on time. Wish the salad had at least cucumbers on it. More veggies not just lettuce 2pieces of tomatoes n a few pieces of red onion. Lasagna really good. Garlic bread chewy. Garlic knots ok. Over all yes I will reorder. Kindness get u a long way in this business however the lasagna was big in portion n really good"}
{"text":"Man this place has the best thin crust pizza in Las Vegas.  It tastes like the NYC pizza I used to eat when I lived near there.  It is family owned and the pasta fagioli reminded me of the food my mother used to make.  Plenty of parking,"}
{"text":"New York Pizza & Pasta overall is a pretty great pizzeria. I enjoy the flavor of the crust along with the sauce. The cheese really isn't bad either. They have pretty decent garlic knots. I tried this place back in the day, and for some reason, I wasn't a fan. Then in the past month or so I've had delivery twice and a couple pickup orders.

I opted for the thin traditional pie the first two times. Everything was great, except for some reason this place doesn't seem to know how to make a pie well done. I ordered it well both times, each time it was slightly undercooked. Considering that they use a brick oven, that's a little baffling and somewhat frustrating. It isn't enough to make me stop going here, but hopefully next time, they'll cook it longer. So with that little annoyance aside, I'll move on to my pickup experience.

I decided to try their Sicilian when I went to pick up. When I arrived, the guy at the counter was pretty unfriendly. Maybe he was just having a bad day, but it was kinda crappy. There was lots of older people that seemed like they owned the joint. I liked that! If it's family owned and operated, they get a few bonus points with me. The Sicilian pizza was pretty incredible. It was one of the best I've had in this town. It was close to a New York Sicilian. That automatically made up for the shoddy customer service and the previously undercooked pies. Those issues prevent me from giving it 5 stars, but damn, that was a delicious Sicilian. I think they beat Verrazano's. The garlic knots here beat Verrazano's as well. So definitely try it out if you haven't already. It's currently my favorite pizzeria! Update: I think the customer service was an isolated incident. The second time I picked up, they treated me great!"}
{"text":"I love this place for lunch.  The salad bar is my go to choice.  The service is quick and friendly.  Everything on the salad, pizza, and pasta bar is always fresh and good.  A great place to come to fill you up. Worth the money."}
{"text":"Just got back to vegas from a New York trip, was reallllly needing my pizza craving satisfied. DONE! This place is great! Family owned, great authentic taste. Coming ng back to try more very soon!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza, some of the best in Vegas. Service is good, prices are right and you will not beat the fried ravioli!"}
{"text":"This Italian restaurant has been in the same place for decades! I don't order delivery food often but when I do I'm glad they are in my area! Good Pasta, good meatballs, good salads and fast delivery too!  It's pretty good home made Italian food! Late Afternoon delivery (4:30 pm) is very fast.  Depending on the day of the week, the potions will vary by a lot.  I've gotten generous portions and barely enough for one person. I was once told they charge for extra sauce? Other times they were happy to give generous servings. It just depends who answers the phone and makes the meal."}
{"text":"We literally were ordering the same exact order from eat24 directly at least ...well checking our history....more than two or three times a month for the last six months....
At least 30% of the time something is wrong with the order...
Nothing extreme in our special requests....no olives, extra crispy crust...pack the chicken separate from pasta...and the like, et cetera...
Tonight was enough of it...we called for the first time for them to fix....I hate to complain....you never know what will be when you make that call.
waiting for them to redeliver...which yes...they say they are making good...which I appreciate. 
they were my go-to for phat pastie ....first world gripes I am aware...
but I think...they are just failing in their execution, not watching or just not caring in the small but important details....which is soooo typical in this town, and - just disappointing in the end. 
If the special instructions are too taxing for them, then they should not be on eat24."}
{"text":"This is my go to place when impromptu entertaining of friend at my house or when coming home from work and not wanting to cook.

My daughter loves the pizza here and they always hook her slices up with extra olives.  My girlfriend love the chicken wings, mild with extra ranch and hot sauce on the side.  I love the grease and meatballs.  But most importantly I love when I'm waiting for the food to be prepared they give me a free drink or some garlic knots or if I ask nicely sometimes I get a meatball out of them."}
{"text":"I had pizza delivery last night..I didnt take a picture as usual because I honestly forgot cause I was dying to dig in..Wow!  Pizza was very New York style..garlic knots were very well made and on point..delivery was prompt and curteous..pizza was hot as if it just came out of the oven! Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"Ordered a Caesar salad with Caesar dressing and what I got was a salad and two sides of oil. Idk what exactly it was but it was 2 little cups of oil with gunk on the bottom. I called to talk to someone about it and all he said was \"sweetie idk what to tell you, you just need to shake it up. Just put it on your salad you'll love it trust me.\" I did shake it, nothing happened and I put it on the salad anyways and It just gave me an oily tasteless salad. I had to throw it away. 

I also ordered a side of fries with some ranch did not get any ranch. The guy on the phone said \"dont worry ill go in the back and yell at them.\" Ok, that doesn't fix anything. Fries were mushy, threw them away too. Waste of 16$ Thanks for nothing."}
{"text":"The pizza would be a 3 star in my pizza rankings, but the friendly staff, great prices, and homey atmosphere earn this place a star bump. I was pretty disappointed in my lunch special pizza. I've been to NYC quite a bit, eaten a LOT of NY pizza and folks this aint it ! I did love the family vibe, and they treated me so well - I just wish the pizza was better. It was like warmed over mall food court type stuff. It *does* remind me of the food court pizzas I've eaten while in the city (Villa pizza in NYC comes to mind), but nothing special. I need to make it over there again beacuse clearly I caught them on a bad day, but unfortunately it's been a month and I still can't bring myself to go back !"}
{"text":"Great pizza! Fresh ingredients and friendly service.
Plenty of tables too since expansion"}
{"text":"This is my third time ordering front here. For the most part the food has been good. We ordered a large pepperoni, but apparently there must be a pepperoni shortage, because our pie just is a little light. Maybe I should have ordered extra pepperoni."}
{"text":"Pizza is average.  One step above Cici's as another reviewer commented.  They don't refill the pizzas often enough also....so if someone hordes the only topping combination you would eat...good luck.  Salad bar crappy, small setup means lack of salad topping possibilities.  No marinara on the buffet to dip crust, breadstick, or anything else into.  

Sandwiches ordered off the menu (non buffet) are very decent.  Chicken parm and meatball are both a lot of food for the money.  Comes with a sad little bag of Ruffles as I recall =/   ...buffalo wings are very decent for the money.  Only 2 sauce choices for wings but you get a lot for the money.   My GF doesn't like going there, when I suggest it as I'm quickly reminded of a dead roach she found on the booth cushion.  Waiters/waitresses are super friendly, I've never had bad service there."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, always very busy, mixed crowd of people.  Tonight it was busy, but service was excellent.

The garlic knots were good and the fried zucchini strips were good.  We ordered a large pizza meatballs, sausage, mushrooms and ricotta cheese.  It was great.  Overall, it was a enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"always great! every time i walk in i feel i am in a little mammas and papas place somewhere inner NYC. they have the best cheese.  i am sorry for your recent loss i hope you keep the quality even though the big man is gone"}
{"text":"This is a pretty solid pizza and comes pretty close to east coast stuff.  I would choose this over most Ray's locations in NYC.  I ordered a side of meatballs cuz someone else recommended it on here but I just thought they were meh.  Certainly gives Metro a run for their money for best pizza closest to my apartment!!"}
{"text":"I have stopped in here twice now for quick bite from the buffet bar. The buffet is good pizza. $8.00 all you can eat. Can eat in 30 min and get back in the road. The staff is very nice. I asked the lady at the counter to fill up the baby's up for the 2 hr drive to Columbia, she asked it I needed a cup. I told her no I had water in the car. She then asked if I wanted fresh ice for that one. How nice is that!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and for a great price. We visit New York pizza and pasta on our vacation to Las Vegas the worst part is there isn't on in Salt Lake City!"}
{"text":"This place had legit New York pizza, and it was delicious. The garlic knots were the best I've had."}
{"text":"We have been on a hunt for pizza but all you can get around here is New York styple pizza and no one knows how to make deep dish or stuffed pizza.  So we've been trying several places to find our go to place.  For New York style pizza, New York Pizza & Pasta is the best we've had in this area and we've tried many places...!  The wings are terrible.  It's a great place to grab a pizza if you don't feel like making food at home.  I'm still not totally satisfied so I'll let you know if I find anything better."}
{"text":"Pizza and calzones are so perfectly perfect that I don't even want to try another place since I moved here! Reasonably priced, fresh, clean and delicious. (I have only done take out).
I grew up near New York. This pizza is done right."}
{"text":"Love this place, my friend eats here almost daily.  Cheese pizza well done, nice reminder of the authentic mom and pop New York pizza joints."}
{"text":"We continue to go there.  Food is always wonderful, service is friendly and welcoming.  Just renovated the dining room.  Even better than before."}
{"text":"the pizza is really good once in awhile, i order their pepperoni and it is really good when it is hot because you can see all the grease floating on top and the cheese is melted and sticks to the roof of my mouth. It hurts but that's why they make water! The buffet is about 6' feet long and I don't think it is worth the money. I only buy the pizza if I have a coupon."}
{"text":"Here is what this place is NOT: overpriced, stuffy, stale, canned, fancy, and formal. 
Here is what this place IS: down-home, buffet-style (if you want that), friendly, delicious, family-fun. 

My kids LOVE this place...and for good reason. The prices are more than reasonable, the food reliable and filling, and the atmosphere is very friendly. Families should FLOCK to this place. Happy they don't, honestly, as it helps me, but it is a wonderful place with incredible people. I can't say enough about how much I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Living near the restaurant for many years, I always wanted to try their pizza. For one reason or another, it never seemed to materialize.

A couple months ago, we had some vendors stop by work, and they asked us to order pizza. Their dime seemed like the best time to give this place a shot.

It was very good. Why did I wait so long?

Today, the boss stops by my desk and asks me where we should go to order pizza for everybody, remembering our last good experience, we went with NY Pizza & Pasta again.

I was given a budget, and (we learned after the fact) stayed under it for 5 multi-topping large pizzas, a couple orders of fries, some mozzarella & zucchini sticks, garlic knots and misc dipping sauces for around $120.

Normally, when pizza is on hand, there are a few people that eat anything and will grab some slices, others that are picky and eat a slice or two, and a few people that NEVER eat pizza.

Jokingly, after lunch, the boss told me that I was going to be fired if I didn't order enough food again. As there was NOTHING, absolutely NOTHING left. It even looked like someone drank the last of the ranch.

The food was so good that every member of our staff fought for as much food as they could get.

The delivery estimate on the site (as I ordered the food online) was 45-60 minutes, I got a call back stating that it may take up to 90 minutes because it is such a large order. Between the original estimate of 45-60 minutes the delivery driver arrived. He set up all of the food in our conference room and surprised us with some 2 liter bottles of soda thrown in as well.

Quick, good food at reasonable prices, if you are in the area, give them a chance!"}
{"text":"Was my 1st time there.  Had the lemon herb chicken with Angel Hair Pasta.  Chicken was done perfect and the sauce was yummy.  They were slamming busy when I got there we several very large tables, so the owner personally took care of my order - thank you Jimmie!  I will be back! 

And you MUST if you do nothing else try their Cannoli - it was the best I have had ever had :)"}
{"text":"We love the pizza here! Being from NJ/NY ourselves it is definitely high quality food! The pizza sauce is what stands out the most, it is absolutely delicious! They also make a great calzone! The only downside is it is definitely a little pricey for a pizza place, but we are never disappointed when we order from here!"}
{"text":"Love this place. We always get double pepperoni, extra cheese and white sauce. That's my phat brothers creation...it's however very delish!!! Gotta stop in one day n try the the buffet."}
{"text":"I really like this place. I've ordered a few things from here for lunch b/c it's close to where I work. Never disappointed! The tuna wrap was good, pasta (red sauce) so flavorful-so pleased. A must try"}
{"text":"I came to this place for a stromboli craving. I've been here before for their pizza (which was traditional NY style) and knew that they wouldn't dissapoint. My stromboli was ready within a reasonable time considering they make all their foods from scratch. It was definitely proportional to my appetite and loved every minute of it. The meat and cheese is good quality and they don't bog it down with extra dough; perfect meat to dough ratio. I will definitely be coming back when I get another hankering!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for many years, mostly because they have great lunch specials, $6.75 for two slices of cheese pizza plus drink, and many other combinations. This is a cool little place off Jones and Sahara. They have lots of tables for eating right off the red checkerboard vinyl tableclothes. It ain't fancy, but it is good. 

Menu has plenty to choose from, pizzas to pastas to meatball subs, and lots more. Its family run, they are originally from NY, so expect that when you talk to them. You won't get fancy service here, just good solid friendly folks with a NY edge. 

Give it a try. The pizza is pretty good, thin crust and huge slices."}
{"text":"Old school Vegas at its finest.  This place is purely for the locals, but with the ever sprawling metropolis popping up its quickly becoming a favorite amongst foodies looking for something more off the beaten path. The owners are truly Italian and this restaurant feels like it should have been a secret meeting place in the movie Casino.  

I ordered the 2 slice lunch special with a drink. The total came out to $6.  Very fun place, even if it doesn't look like much from the outside or inside. Worth checking out once."}
{"text":"I never really write reviews, but, this was my first time here and I loved it. I got the cheeseburger and a slice of cheese pizza. The pizza was burnt but it wasn't too burnt, it was still good regardless. The cheeseburger was good too! I will definetly seeing myself returning here. The customer service is lovely as well!"}
{"text":"I ordered a 8 piece Chicken dinner and the chicken was burnt, the fries were rubbery and the coleslaw was funky tasting. Was not very happy with the food. I won't be ordering from them anymore. I think I deserve a refund on the this order. I won't feed it to my dog if I had one!!"}
{"text":"I just gotta give these guys the pizza crown. They deserve it. Real NY pizza, great sauce, authentic ambiance, this place just oozes NY. I think I would know, I was born and raised there... 

I went back again and ordered a large pie by myself and almost downed the whole thing. All I could think about was how amazing each bite was. 

I will always come back here. They are just a great bunch of people and the pizza is so good! Forget the rest, seriously. This is where it's at."}
{"text":"Great takeout (delivery) from Eat24! Wonderful food & when you ask for extra sauce they give it to you!!! Terrific spaghetti marinara, and chicken fingers. Spaghetti includes a side salad. Delivered quickly by a very friendly considerate delivery man. We will be ordering from them again!"}
{"text":"You guys! This is amazing I got my fettuccine Alfredo and it looks amazing you get your moneys worth and you get a lot along with a salad and you also get a garlic bread it's a lot of food you guys!"}
{"text":"I love this place and it's so close to my house, so pick up or delivery is what I tend to do here. I used to go to pizza hut all the time, it was my favorite but since I found this place it has become the main takeout pizza place... I'm a big fan of their calzones, normally ordering a Italian sausage and spinach in my personal size. Along with that we tend to order a ham and pineapple and then ALWAYS a large double eggplant. Yum!!!! I never would have thought it would be so tasty like that. Anyways, The staff is always very friendly and always have my whole order finished within the timeframe the set for me. As long as I live close, I'll be coming here."}
{"text":"Just discovered this gem today! And I'm so glad. Awesome lunch specials! Two HUGE slices of pizza and a drink for $6! It's super good thin crust...crispy and chewy just how I like it! Got to check it out."}
{"text":"nowadays, mediocre at best. Went there once recently, and the food has went down hill compared to where it used to be, haven't been back again."}
{"text":"Pizza around the area that I live sucks!  I've lived in this town all my life and have had good pizza before but the places don't stay in business forever, unfortunately.

So, I was on this side of town craving pizza and Yelp directions to the nearest pizza pizza joint.  This one had good reviews so I decided to stop in. I'm glad I did!
I got a medium two topping pizza with extra sauce and surprise, surprise they actually gave me extra sauce!!.  I got an order of garlic knots which were very garlicky...which is my favorite...and soft;  just yummy little nuggets of love!!!

I never eat the crust because I'm usually full and I had to actually forced myself to eat them they were so delicious the crust is fabulous the sauce is incredible and what is Italian food... It's ALL about the sauce!

I have been back twice since then and from now on when I want pizza or Italian food of any type, this is where I'm going!  It takes me a good half an hour to get there and back...but it's well worth it!

 I have since had the meatball sub which is excellent and a sausage, onion, green pepper sub which was good.

P.S.  There Pepsi Machine is calibrated correctly and it is awesome!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing pasta (THE best marinara I've had eating out in Vegas!!!) and pretty darn good pizza. Occasionally the service is a little slow, but the wait staff are always friendly, so I don't mind. 

My favorite dinner is ziti with sausage and peppers (it comes with soup or salad) and a glass of the house red wine  But it's hard to find pizza or pasta that's not delicious!"}
{"text":"When my family and friends from Brooklyn visit me in Vegas and want pizza, I only take them to NY Pizza  & Pasta , Need I say more?"}
{"text":"Pizza was so delicious and the service was absolutely the best you could find. I recommend anyone coming by if you love pizza and food."}
{"text":"I love NY Pizza & Pasta. I have been going here since I was a baby. Family restaurant and I adore the staff, they are always so welcoming! One of the few places you can get REAL NY pizza. Prices are reasonable, never have to wait for seating and overall great food!"}
{"text":"I'm not very happy with my calzone lots of cheese isn't melted and the ham they use looks and tastes like cut up lunch meat ham that you see in the zip lock bags at grocery stores"}
