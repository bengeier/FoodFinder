{"text":"We went here because some reviews seemed good. But I won't go back. It was fairly dead in there, maybe 3 or 4 other tables. It still took them over 15 minutes to come with menus or take a drink order, even though they were looking at us the whole time. Too busy just chatting or standing behind the bar doing nothing. I think they saw we were about to get up and leave, then they came over. When the food came, it was not that great. Edible, but just barely. Getting the bill was no better, sat there probably another 20 minutes while they looked at us with disinterest. Finally had to go up there and ask for it and pay. Was never happier to leave a restaurant in my life. But all that notwithstanding, the waitress seemed friendly enough when she finally came to serve us, soooo slow, but friendly. But unfortunately that's the only positive."}
{"text":"I literally drove by this place a million times yet my first time I actually visiting this place and tried their wings! It's a decent local pub and quite frankly I thought it was just another hole on a wall but once you get in it feels warm cozy and feels homie. 

Quite a place to just chill and relax. That being said they have lots of leisure things to do to pass on time like pool table and darts. First I thought it has potential to be a shisha bar they have comfortable chairs and marble tables. Service is great reasonable price and orders are reasonably timed.

All in all the realstate is used well but not effectively. First impression was confusing and the location quite inconvenient due to the grocery store right beside it. Hard to find parking if the place is filled with shoppers. But In all I had fun."}
{"text":"There are some places in the NE that I'm sure would have me clicking my heels three times and wishing my way out of there and back home. Thankfully, the Black Lion was not one of these places. Well, at least not so long as I knew a couple of the karaoke goers and the couple of them knew almost all of the rest of the bar.

Black Lion is one of the many pubs in a strip mall that our city seems to have (have you ever noticed our over-abundance of strip malls?). When I first pulled up, it looked empty. I thought maybe karaoke had been cancelled, or maybe I'd missed the folks I was meeting. But alas! Little can you see from the outside, there's an entire other room in the back. And what should it have? Karaoke! Connie was the name of the karaoke host. I must admit, she was a pretty awesome host.

The server way up yonder in the likes of Temple is not one you would find downtown. Only in the NE. But that's part of the charm of some of these neighbourhood bars. When I first sat down, she took a moment or two to make her way over. Her explanation: 

\"Oh there you are!! I could see you while you were standing up and coming through the bar, but when you sat down, it's like you disappeared! It took me a minute to find you. Can I get you something to drink?\" she asked.

I laughed and then asked, \"What have you got on tap?\"

\"Beer,\" she answered. Then broke into a grin of her own. \"I always like saying that to people!\" She then proceeded to list off the 3 beers on tap. I went for the Black Lion Lager. Nothing special, but most people can handle a lager, right?

Twas a fun night! You should go for karaoke."}
