{"text":"Good food horrible service. We had the short haired heavier server with glasses and it was absolutely horrible. She constantly makes you feel like she wants to get you of there. Our whole party felt rushed. Huge turn off constantly asking if she could take our check when all we wanted to do was enjoy the conersation with our group. Won't be back with that kind of service."}
{"text":"We checked this out after reading about it in the city paper. We made it in time for happy hour (5-7) and took advantage of the $5 cocktail menu and $2 sake shots. Both of which were very good! They also offer half off apps so we tried the gyoza and the cha-shu bao. Both were good. I wish I would've ordered another gyoza app just for myself!

We each tried a different ramen (shoyu tare paitan and rayu paitan), which is a lot of ramen, so we had leftovers for lunch today. The staff was very knowledgeable, attentive and friendly. We are definitely going back in the near future!"}
{"text":"Very welcoming atmosphere. Excellent food and incredibly knowledgeable bar staff. If you want a bar experience that rivals a trip to Japan, check this place out. The whisky selection alone is worth the trip. Definitely give Yuzu Kitchen a try!"}
{"text":"I snuck in here on a random Tuesday afternoon to write and check out this relatively new spot downtown Pittsburgh. The ambiance, the food, the drink - all on the one!  I had the robata chicken lunch and it was quite a generous - and delicious - helping of food. The vibe is so cool, much in the style of an authentic Japanese izakaya. I'll have to try this for happy hour/dinner, but have an excellent working or liquid lunch here. Reasonable prices and a dope atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Even after traveling all over the west coast, this is the best ramen I've had. It has great flavor yet isn't heavy. I love it!!"}
{"text":"Best ramen shop in Pittsburgh hands down. I don't understand why it is always empty but for a foodie like me I can say it is delicious and the service is always great. I think the reason is the location but if this ramen bar was anywhere else in Pittsburgh aka lawrenceville, this would be the go to spot. Either way I will keep going there bc of the quality of food!!!"}
{"text":"Really good asian food. A ton of vegeterian options which was great for me. Good happy hour discount on drinks and select appetizers. Husband really enjoyed his meal as well. Nice decor. Very clean bathrooms and kitchen. Modern decor. I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Here is yet another example of wishing we could give half stars. I would have given them 3.5 stars. The pics show what I have had and the soup is always hot and good. The steak on the stick was also really good. Place is always packed at lunch during the week, so get there early if you can. I have been there 4 times so far and will keep going back unless something changes. I always go for the soup but I will have to try something other than that. Their prices are on point also; no crazy prices that I noticed on the menu. Note to owners: Please get garlic chips for the soup. Thank you...."}
{"text":"I'm so thrilled there are more ramen restaurants in Pittsburgh and I think it's what downtown needed. Yuzu is off the beaten path so I hope it doesn't become forgotten, as the ramen is pretty good and perfect for a cold day in Pittsburgh. When my husband and I stopped in for lunch, surprisingly there was no one in the restaurant. It made us nervous at first but my rayu paitan ramen and his tang tang mien noodles proved to us that Yuzu was a gem. I also couldn't help but notice how big the bar was, which I plan to return for happy hour one of these days!"}
{"text":"Walked in during dinner time on a weekday and luckily, towards the end of happy hour. It wasn't busy at all, so me and my dinner date were quite a bit skeptic.. but we said \"eh, this place is new, let's give it a chance!\"

First things first. Their ramen is a definite upgrade from instant ramen, but I don't know if this was a meal that blew me away. It was as if something was missing or felt as though the soup didn't have very much depth to it?

SPICY KARAAGE ($4, HH*): Not spicy. Came out fresh and crispy. It was good, but also not that flavorful? The paprika aioli made up for that!
MOSCOW MULE ($5, HH*): Typical moscow mule here, tasted a bit on the strong side though. My date had the Old Maid which was really refreshing and didn't even taste very alcoholic (probably because it was gin?)
RAYU PAITAN ($15): Our server's favorite. Yum, I loved the cha-shu. Like I said though, it felt a little bit like it had something missing I guess. It wasn't amazingly delicious, but it did give me the vibes of an authentic ramen. If you aren't looking for spicy, either ask for the rayu (pepper sauce) on the side or get the 2nd favorite miso paitan.
*Happy Hour

I really liked the trendy atmosphere and the cherry blossom painted on the wall. Service was great, very attentive and kind servers. Not a lot of choices for food, but that's good for those indecisive people. They seem to have a very large drink menu too if that's what you'd be interested in. (Japanese whisky?! What's a whisky highball? I'd come back to try that.) 

It is likely that I'd return to Yuzu Kitchen if I'm in downtown, but I don't know if I would go out of my way to eat here. Definitely worth a shot though if you're debating on coming!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and have meaning to write a review on how delicious and satisfying the ramen is.  Next time I'm going to try to get something else other than ramen.  The cocktails are also fire.  I left feeling full (but in a healthy, light way) and wonderfully buzzed."}
{"text":"Came to this place yesterday night, ramen was good, and the soup broth as good as what they promoted (cooked 18 hours). You cannot expect more from the chicken broth."}
{"text":"First the decor is really cool. The service was great. She was very knowledgeable on what the items on the  menu are because it has a lot of un-familiar items. My husband got the Shio Paitan and he said it was the best he ever had! Very Flavorful and hearty. Me being a vegetarian was very underwhelmed and disappointed. For starters got the Bean Curd which wasnt bad but my entree of Veg  Ramon was bland, boring and hardly anything in it. I added some extra vegetable umami bomb to help which it didnt. I ended up putting spicy chili paste in it to give it some sort of flavor. 
So this place is great for meat eaters but I wouldn't recommend it for Vegetarians at all. Just because I dont eat meat doesnt mean I just want bland empty bowl of tofu and noodles. I see from other reviews im not the only one who feels this way"}
{"text":"Wow. What a great addition to downtown. I haven't done the Ramen thing in the past so this was a new experience. Staff was helpful and we were told exactly what to try. Very good food and service."}
{"text":"So I should preface this review with the fact that I'm a vegan, so my options are limited. Anyway, I had the ramen noodles with their veggie broth and loaded with veggies. It was just okay. Nothing memorable about it and could have used some extra fixings to jazz it up a bit. 

I will say I love the vibe in here. Although the two times I went it was literally empty on a Saturday evening, they had a nice playlist going and the bar area is super trendy. I'd be willing to come back and try their other vegan friendly apps."}
{"text":"This downtown restaurant was on my list of \"gotta try some day\" restaurants in the burgeoning downtown Pittsburgh restaurant scene for a few months. I decided to check it out with a friend for lunch during the week.  

There was some kind of building scaffolding on the sidewalk outside of the entrance which made it even harder to find.  Thank goodness for the silver mailbox with their street number emblazoned on it or we might still be wandering around looking for the place.  The doorway is sort of set back from the street in case you have trouble too.

We had no idea how cute the interior would be that greeted us.  The chandelier above the bar is really beautiful and the color palette they used is calming and earthy.  It's perfect for a ramen place. The hostess seated us quickly and the waitress took our orders within a few minutes.  

We shared a pot of hot jasmine green tea that was very flavorful and the perfect temperature.  Sometimes tea in those pots is just lukewarm and sort of bath tub temp range.  Yuck.  This was nice and hot. 

The Ramen bowls were filled with flavor and different textures and the noodles were perfectly cooked.  The 30 minute egg was packed with delicious flavors and was a brownish color, presumably from soaking in that amazing bath of broth.  The pork belly and mushrooms just took the whole Shio Paitan Ramen over the top.  Really tremendous bowl of ramen.  My friend has the spicy Rayu Paitan which was similar to the Shio Paitan but carried a nice kick to it. 

I would definitely like to try some of the other dishes and I hear they have a nice sake happy hour during the week.  I mean, really, who doesn't like sake cocktails and delicious bowls of ramen after a long day at work?"}
{"text":"My experience at Yuzu Kitchen was okay. I went with three girlfriends for lunch and the food was good enough - my favorite was the gyoza that we shared - but none of the other dishes really were memorable. What was memorable is that our server forgot to put half of our food in.. and didn't realize until we asked about it after sitting awkwardly for 30 minutes. At that point we needed to get back to work so we asked to take the food to go, and we were assured that those items would be removed from our check. But when the check arrived they hadn't been removed so we had to remind her, which was also pretty awkward. Overall... not my favorite. I might go back to try it again, but there are so many good lunch spots downtown that I'd rather not risk it!"}
{"text":"Beautiful!
Stop in for a drink at the amazing bar!

Noodles were good - tasty- nice presentation!

Lettuce wrapped appetizer and spring rolls were very good!
Stop in - experience the surroundings - enjoy the food"}
{"text":"I went here when visit Pittsburgh and don't know where to eat at night, I found Yuzu on yelp, nearby where I stayed. Place is calm, price is good, and food is good. Come if you like the lounge style Japanese restaurant"}
{"text":"Beautiful decor and great food. Although they have various options, I believe their strength is in their Ramen. 

The service was excellent and very attentive.

The Ramen was spicy and delicious. All the ingredients were of the highest quality. 

While I was expecting Korean cuisine, the name Yuzu is meant to suggest Korea, Japan and China, the 3 countries that feature this fruit in their recipes."}
{"text":"Ramen on a cold, wintry day might be the best thing ever invented.  I've been here twice and couldn't be happier.  Both times I have gotten ramen with the 30 minute egg which I highly recommend.  The first time I got the one with the pulled chicken which was excellent.  This last time I got the one with the pork belly and mushrooms which was very spicy, but also very delicious. 

A bowl runs from $12-$15 and is enough for two meals, so long as you don't eat all the \"good stuff\" out in one sitting - I usually do and then am left with a bowl of just noodles and broth for leftovers, but I am happy with that as well.  

Excellent downtown addition with very pleasant wait staff and bartenders.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on 7/7/17 which was 3 days after grand opening.  The decor is nice, staff is friendly, and we were seated without a wait for a party of 5 at lunch time.  However, the broth was lacking.  The table got a variety of styles and we all agreed they seemed bland.  Also, we thought about ordering a round of drinks but Sapporo was $9 a can which is steep so we passed.  I'm not ruling out going back to give it another try, just may wait a bit in hopes they perfect the broth."}
{"text":"Reading other Yelp reviews of Yuzu led me there in December. Several reviews mentioned the goyza - and for good reason! We started with an order and the spring rolls. Both were done very well. The dumplings were very well done and the spring rolls were crispy and the sauce was nice and tangy. The spring rolls do have large mushrooms in them - which I didn't mind, but was a turn off for the other half of my party.

I am a noodle fan, so we skipped the ramen and went straight for the noodle options. 

Basil:
Ordered with chicken. Tasty and cooked well, but given my affinity for spice, I had to add some to it.

Peanut Noodles:
Interestingly enough, if someone had handed me a dish of this and asked what I was eating I would have said with strong certainty that it was Pad Thai... very similar tastes. Luckily, that's one of my favorite dishes so I was on board! The tofu was fried and delish.

Beverages:
I was more interested in beer than the cocktail list this night so I settled on a Sapporro. $9 for a 22oz is a bit high for Pittsburgh - but they did also have Kirin Ichiban for $5 and a handful of other options. We missed happy hour, so I'm guessing an earlier arrival would make these options more affordable."}
{"text":"YES!  I've been eagerly awaiting the opening of this place ever since I heard about it.  Downtown Pittsburgh needs more interesting offerings to mix it up for the working crowd at lunchtime.  A friend and I came today and we both got ramen bowls and chrysanthemum iced tea, which were delicious.  I'm only holding to 4 stars because I've not yet tried the cocktails and--this is my ugly Americanness coming out--I would have liked to have seen just a *bit* more types of items on the menu.  I recognize that ramen is their star item, but perhaps we can get some dumplings and other noodle dishes up on offer?  Service was great.  Definitely making a return trip."}
{"text":"Visited with my sister for a Thursday happy hour to try some snacks and ramen! The happy hour specials are pretty good, $5 cocktails, other drink specials, and some half priced apps!

There weren't many people when we stopped by (one other party of two), but the inside has a lot of space and is very nicely decorated. Service seemed a little awkward - We walked in to a pretty empty restaurant, made eye contact with a couple of workers and the bartenders but received no greeting. After walking through the restaurant, we were about to just seat ourselves when one of the workers came up to us and asked if we were a party of two.

We were led to a table and given menus. The waitress left and brought back water, and my sister asked if all of the apps were half off for happy hour (we only had online reviews to go off of at this point). The waitress seemed a bit monotone and grumpy, but replied that she'd get us a happy hour menu. We were a bit confused as to why we didn't receive that menu right off the bat, but no harm done.

We ordered a couple of apps to share and a bowl of ramen each. The apps were really tasty - we tried the karaage and cha-siu bao. Both were really fresh and flavorful! 

I got the vegetable curry ramen. The broth was a lot less flavorful than I hoped, as were the other vegetables and tofu that came in it. The noodles were a good texture, but the dish seemed very bland, especially compared to the appetizers we'd just eaten.

Overall, we enjoyed the food, especially the appetizers, but felt the service was not very friendly or attentive. If I visit again, I would probably go for more appetizers and maybe try an entree other than the ramen; they did have a wide array of noodles and stir-fry."}
{"text":"In a town known for their Polish food and Primanti's, I was pleasantly surprised to find a really good Japanese restaurant.  Had their squid karaage, tempura shrimp, string bean chicken, and tang tang mein.  All were very tasty but had to take one star off because it was a little salty for me.  Yuzu is on par with a lot of the 3 & 4 Star Japanese restaurants in Cali. 

The two appetizers were great.  Tempura batter was light and crispy, squid was soft and not rubbery. 

String bean chicken had great flavors and chicken was very tender. 

Tang Tang Mein had a little spicy kick from the kimchi and noodles were perfectly cooked. 

If you are looking for a good asian restaurant in downtown I highly recommend Yuzu!"}
{"text":"Decent but expensive. I came for happy hour and regular dinner on a Friday evening. The bar was a little busy but tables were easy to come by. I ordered a spicy chicken bao bun and Cognac drink during happy hour. The buns were smaller and didn't have much meat but flavorful and the drink was strong. Each was only $5 so can't complain there. I ordered the chicken katsu curry (which isn't listed on the online menu). The chicken was hot and crispy but the flavor of the curry sauce was lacking. Most curry sauces, you can pick the spice level but you weren't able to here. The portion was large but dinner prices average from $13-15 and more if you want extras. Total was $25 not including tax/tip"}
{"text":"This is maybe a 3.5 for me, but I bumped it up to a 4 because of their happy hour specials.   

The good:   
- The happy hour specials.  They have a few cocktails, a few beers, and a red and white wine, with a selection of $3.50 appetizers.
- The pork belly bao.  This dish was delicious.  Two pork belly steamed buns for $3.50 (regularly $7).     
- The white wine selection.  Couldn't tell you what it was, but it was crisp and refreshing for $7 (regularly $11)

The \"eh\": 
- The spicy fried chicken appetizer.  The sauce and breading were good and it was surprisingly large for the happy hour price, but the chicken itself was stringy and tough.  
- The peanut noodles.  Labeled as spicy on the menu, these were a bland and boring version of Pad Thai.  The chicken here was also stringy and chewy - I just didn't dig it.  
- The service.   It wasn't bad, but no one really smiled or acted like they were happy to be there. Not unfriendly, but not friendly either."}
{"text":"My husband was looking for a unique place to eat, and chose this. It was excellent! Several dishes we'd never heard of. My husband ordered the squid karaage as an appetizer. It was perfect-tasty and whetted our appetites for the rest of the meal.  I had the rabata and the gyoza. The rabata was cooked perfectly, both the meat and vegetables. My husband and son had ramen and really enjoyed it. My husband added a spicy sauce and said it was just right. The service was very good. Nice atmosphere, too. They have happy hour, with half priced appetizers and other good deals, every day, including Saturday. They are closed on Sunday. Next time we are in Pittsburgh, we'll come back."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today and ordered the veg ramen. At $12 it is a bit pricey for lunch. The ramen was rather bland/mundane. Luckily they offered some chili oil to give it some pizazz. It comes in a large bowl that is only filled about half way. I finished my meal and was still hungry. Mentally it is difficult to get over the fact that you could get over 12 portions of freeze dried top ramen for the same price! Yes, not as good, but it would be a lot cheaper and more filling. I want to say I would give this place another try, as I'm curious and interested in exploring the menu some more, but i don't think I will be throwing this place into the regular lunch rotation."}
{"text":"Yummy! Talk about awesome atmosphere and amazing food!! Love this spot, I highly recommend the appetizers and the unagi!"}
{"text":"Yuzu Kitchen is filling the void in downtown.  I'm excited to have a ramen spot within walking distance and it's definitely bringing the Asian cuisine up a notch here. The restaurant is spacious and they still need to break out the comfort zone in downtown.  I like their happy hour special but they really need a ramen lunch special to compete downtown.  The ramen is not bad but at $15, I call that a bit steep."}
{"text":"Yuzu kitchen started the evening as my second choice, but when my first choice closed for business a half hour before we arrived...Yuzu was the happy ending I DESERVED.  

There was not one negative.  I don't know that the food was so good I'd categorize it as five star ordinarily...but...it WAS good.  Really good.  And because it was well-prepared, graciously and quickly served, inexpensive, and delicious...man, I'm hard-pressed to argue myself into a four star review.

The cocktail menu is a high point.  There are some delicious drinks on there.  We made it about four deep in our sampling before cutting our losses, and three out of four were worth returning for in and of themselves.  

The food was flavorful comfort food with nice portion sizes.  We ordered a robata sampler appetizer (marinated grilled meats and vegetables on skewers) that was delicious and more than enough for two as an app.  The Da Shoyu Mein entree (ramen / pulled pork / korean pickled bean sprouts shoda shoyu tare / 30 min egg / scallions sauteed mushrooms) I ordered cost $12.  $12. 

Server was quick/attentive/knowledgeable.  Laughed at our jokes.  That's important...you know...to me.  

Didn't cost an arm and a leg.  Though the cocktail menu prices were consistent with a downtown restaurant (read:  high) the food was inexpensive.  Your bar bill WILL end up costing more than your food.  But...in downtown Pittsburgh, the price point of the cocktails is right there with surrounding venues.

With Pittsburgh's restaurant-rich vibe, the true test of a restaurant for me is whether or not I'd return.  There are just too many great new untried restaurants to go back to a mediocre visit. I will definitely be back!

Food: 4.5
Service: 5
Atmosphere: 4 (it's clean, pretty, dark marble, polished fixtures...but nothing extraordinary)
Price point: 6 (whatever.  I can do what I want in the text of the review)
Overall combination:  5

Great for dates, happy hours, Asian comfort food, relax and have a drink"}
{"text":"This restaurant deserves a solid 4 stars. The food is decent, and my server (Asian girl...I forgot her name but she was really nice) was excellent.

The menu is medium sized for lunch, which isn't a bad thing. I do get annoyed by those restaurants that offer a huge menu, but do everything mediocre.

Everything was good. Tasty, decent portions, and they have a bar that offers additional seating for diners.

I didn't have a chance to try the Robata grilled items on the menu. I will the next time for sure.

I like the fact that this place is more true to what an actual izakaya (Japanese pub) is supposed to be. There's an excellent place in Highland Park (Teppanyaki Kyoto), but all the other \"izakaya\" style restaurants in Pittsburgh are either knock offs or have completely missed the mark.

Yuzu Kitchen is a good addition to the downtown restaurant scene, and I hope they continue to do well and last for a long, long time."}
{"text":"Great new find! Excellent service and good atmosphere. Food was great. I will be back to try more ramen. Really top notch quality."}
{"text":"This was a really great experience! We called last minute for a group dinner and they were able to accommodate us. Happy hour specials are great, I loved the Kentucky mule, a fun twist on the traditional Moscow mule. Also very good prices for the quality and portion sizes of the entrees. Ambiance is also cool, I would describe it as modern and eclectic but also cozy. I would recommend this place to everyone. Pictured is one of the ramen bowls we ordered it was a garlic miso broth and super delicious."}
{"text":"A group of us went to Yuzu Kitchen last night - wow.  SO impressed.

We're a bunch of ramen aficionados that are bummed about Pittsburgh's lack of good ramen - until NOW.  Yuzu has a good selection of staples - the chashu was cooked perfectly, the broths were nicely layered and deep.  We even got to taste test some of the \"winter\" options coming up in the next few weeks, and damn.  Needless to say, we'll be going back in the next few weeks.

Salt/pepper tofu - don't like tofu?  Are you sure?  TRY this.  Like tofu?  Ooooh you're going to be happy with these. 
Gyoza - standard, delicious.
Chicken on a stick - sharing?  Hoard that peanut sauce.  Don't share it with your tablemates.  

Rayu ramen - nice spicy kick, perfectly cooked chashu.  I added baby bok choy and was pleased with the decision.
Miso ramen - NOM.  Pulled chicken?  Delicous.
General Tso's (because why not?) - CRISPY.  DEEP SMOKY/SWEET FLAVOR.  Best General Tso's I've ever had, hands down

There were other things we ate - nothing disappointed.  I'm going to try and wrap this up.  EAT HERE.

Oh, and get the kimchi - this is a daikon radish kimchi.  As someone who lived in Korea for two years - do it.  DO IT.  Crunchy, spicy, umami.  It's everything.

The ONLY bad thing that I would have to say is that the noodles aren't anything to write home about, but they weren't bad and they didn't detract from the dishes."}
{"text":"More like 3.5 stars than 3, but not quite 4. Service was great. I came in with a coworker for lunch and the first thing the bartender asked us was if we were on a lunch break. That's key. Great when people understand that we only have a certain about of time to dine. 

We had the steam buns for an app, they were good. Bun itself was very good along with the aioli, chicken was decent. 

I had the Rayu Paitan and my coworker had the Miso Paitan. I enjoyed it, but I don't think it was anything I will crave. I've had other ramen and while I did appreciate the attention to detail at Yuzu, the flavor was missing something. My coworker said his Miso was overly salty and he usually loves Miso. 

I'd go back, but probably not until I'm really really looking for Ramen on my lunch break again."}
{"text":"May be the only Ramen in downtown Pittsburgh but it is delicious! We had both the Shoyu Ramen and Robata skewers! Also, the beverage selection is quite unique! The liter of Asahi super dry was great! #mynamejeff"}
{"text":"Pricey for the quality and staff wasn't too friendly.  Go to Lawrenceville or squirrel hill for better ramen."}
{"text":"** Good service and good atmosphere but very mediocre ramen, nothing special about the taste. Decent deals for drinks and appetizers (apps) at happy hour.

Noticed this place as a new restaurant in downtown that serves ramen, so I decided to try it out since ramen (or good ramen) is hard to find or basically non existent in Pittsburgh. I initially made a reservation at 6:30, and since I was worried I would be late I called in and they seemed totally chill about it.. turns out when I got there I noticed there was nobody else in the restaurant at Thursday ~6:45 PM so that made me a little uneasy.

Since it was still happy hour, I ordered an old maid ($5) and the spicy karage - fried chicken ($4). Both were pretty good.. basically tasted exactly as you might expect.

But let's focus on the ramen cuz that's the main point of the restaurant. I ordered the Rayu Paitan with the hot sauce on the side. Im from the Bay Area, so maybe my standards are too high but nothing about the ramen was special to me besides the bowl they put it in. My main disappointment was in the noodles, which I thought did not have a good texture. They seemed too soft and bland, and in my opinion for good ramen they need to be nice and chewy. I'm not a huge fan of chicken broth based ramen, so I wished they had sesame based options, like kuro ramen which is my favorite. Three slices of pork belly, egg, and corn.. but none of it really stood out.

Positives: Pretty friendly and helpful staff. Nicely decorated for a good vibe and also a good place to talk since it wasn't loud (but then again no one was there)."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give Yuzu a great review because, well, I love ramen.  I tried the house Miso Ramen.  $15.  Let me level set, I pay $13 for Miso Ramen in NYC.....

Unfortunately, the Miso at Yuzu was very bland.  No spice, the broth must have been ultra low MSG.  The chicken was likely purchased from Sysco or another food distributor, baked in the oven, then shredded.  No soul, no creativity.  What a bummer.

To be fair, I had a friend who really enjoyed his spicy ramen; however, I had one meal.  That being said, I believe that everything on the menu should be prepared with the same care as the best thing on the menu, so two stars it is for the high price and low flavor."}
{"text":"This is probably the best ramen in town. We went late on a Saturday night, and it was emptier than I thought. The restaurant is very simple, and the waitress was great. 

I had the Shoyu ramen, as well as the pork belly bao. It was quite expensive ($15/bowl of ramen), but worth it! All of the ramens, aside from the veggie ramen, were fifteen dollars a bowl. They also had dry options and rice bowl options as well. 

The noodles were a bit soft (I usually like them a bit chewier), but the taste was great. I enjoyed the food, and I will be back!"}
{"text":"I've been searching for good ramen in this city for a while now and I was thrilled when I learned we had one downtown near my work. Everything on the menu looked good so I thought it would be promising. Sadly I was left very disappointed. 

I ordered a ramen bowl and paid extra to add kimchi. Once I got it back to my desk I realized they charged me for the kimchi but neglected to add it to my bowl which was very upsetting. I absolutely love kimchi so this was a big strike for me. On top of that their ramen is fairly pricey which was another complaint I had. Lastly, the ramen was very bland and tasteless. All of those things combined resulted in me having to give Yuzu a fairly low rating."}
{"text":"Dear sweet nelly!!  The Karaage Curry Ramen is pure bliss.  They absolutely spend the time and attention to detail that makes this one of the best ramen bowls I've ever had.  The staff is awesome bartender and hostess.  Always a pleasure seeing them.  But maaaaan....  that chicken karaage will make your day with the perfect coconut curry broth with crispy fried chicken and bangin' noodles."}
{"text":"From the start when I walked in, service was attentive. Which isn't necessarily good or bad? A young man in an apron approached me first to pour my water and that was a little confusing.

The menu is fairly small, and the drink selections (alcohol wise) weren't the greatest unfortunately (I forgot to ask if regular wine, beer, and liquor options existed). However, the purple drink (the name escapes me right now), was delicious when it came out. 

I am the first to admit, I've been ignorant of TRUE ramen my entire life. I've only ever eaten the styrofoam bowl ramen and the microwave/hot water package ramen. To have REAL ramen for the first time was terrific, and I appreciate my server walking me through how to order it and what the differences were with patience, understanding, and appreciating the humor of it all.

To end- the ramen was amazing, the drink was delicious, and you should make your way here at the next available opportunity!"}
{"text":"New spot in Downtown Pittsburgh on Wood Street. Please note that this review is biased because The Bar Director is my kid.  Also met The Owner. Both fellas are really nice. Had a pork ramen  with pork belly, shrooms, corn, bean sprouts and some other goodies. Have an open mind if you haven't tried ramen before and be sure to let TBD suggest your beverage. He won't steer you wrong."}
{"text":"Yuzu Kitchen has amazing happy hour specials, a super friendly staff, great food, and beautiful decor. I ordered some veg ramen with an egg and the flavors were spot on. Portions are HUGE. I also tried a few cocktails, the one with Lavender & Gin was my favorite. Before our meal, we ordered the fried tofu & edamame. I was really surprised by the portion of both appetizers. The tofu was crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and seasoned with just the right amount of salt, pepper, and green onions. The edamame was cooked PERFECTLY. Our waitress was patient, charming, and silly, which I found very pleasing. I can't believe how much food we got for the price we paid. This place seems like it would be good for small groups, or for an intimate evening for loved ones. I will definitely be back with some friends because more people need to see how amazing it is."}
{"text":"Another really good Ramen place in Pittsburgh. I have to grade these places on a Pittsburgh scale as I've traveled all over Japan. Great Ramen place for this city."}
{"text":"I love this place. If you're looking for good ramen and bao buns, check this place out. They have the best bao and ramen I've had in Pittsburgh. I'm originally from Philadelphia area, where my go-to place was Nom Nom Ramen in the city and this is the most similar place I've found.

Apps/small plates are cheap(even cheaper during happy hour!) but still great quality, cooked and prepared perfectly. Ramen is amazing, the shio is great; yuzu bomb is so good. Love their gyoza, bao, and spring rolls. The atmosphere is very chill. Staff has always been very friendly. Wish I could visit more often, I would seriously eat here every day if I had the funds lol"}
{"text":"Excellent stir fry and shrimp fried rice! i definitely would recommend this place."}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to check this spot out for a Wednesday lunch last week. I was surprised at how well done the design is and how upscale the materials used in the space are - I guess I just had no idea what to expect! I had a really hard time reading the menu. I feel like they could help with a definition or vocab list. Or atleast have the servers more forthcoming with explanations to help those that are uneducated. I was curious and asking questions but did not learn much about the menu's nuances :(  I ended up ordering what was described to me as an elevated ramen soup or sorts - \"Shoyu Tare Paitan pork marrow / chicken broth / shoda shoyu tare / scallions sauteed mushrooms / cha-shu (marinated pork belly) 30 min egg / corn / nori\".  I think I made a good choice - it was delicious! Our meal arrived within 5 mins and was very tasty and fulfilling. Great lunch spot or take out choice for those working downtown. Would like to return to try the curry options."}
{"text":"Service and interior are good. Food is horrible! I know how really good ramen tastes like and the ramen which they gave probably from market. Doesn't matter how service is good, if food is horrible , i can not recommend this restaurant to my friends at all"}
{"text":"So, I and one of my intrepid lunch partners-in-crime (LPIC) decided that we were going to check out Yuzu Kitchen because we had been meaning to go there, but with the addition of so many new restaurants in Downtown Pittsburgh, it took us a minute to get there.  But get there, we did!
First of all, I'm a damn dumpling fanatic.  I don't care whose cuisine we're talking about, if they have a dumpling, I'm trying it.  I asked our server about the Gyoza at Yuzu Kitchen and she said that they were her favorites.  Say no more!  Put me down for the gyoza!  GBD(Golden, Brown and Delicious!) and moist and flavorful and freshly made and tasty and porky!  Yuzu Kitchen's gyoza rank up there with some of the best that I have had in San Francisco's and New York City's Chinatown neighborhoods. (I hate when restaurants serve \"frozen\" gyoza and try to pawn them off as house-made.  Yech!)

As far as our entrees, me and my LPIC were going to go with the ramen but decided to go with the \"Da Shoyu Mein\" at the last minute. Ramen noodles with pulled pork, Korean pickled bean sprouts, scallions, mushrooms and a 30 minute egg!  What form of madness is this?  Crazy goodness!  I swore off all forms of ramen noodles after college. (When the only thing that you can afford is 10 packs for a dollar ramen noodles and you eat them almost EVERY DAY for several years, you would swear them off too!)  However, Yuzu Kitchen made me a believer and we are already contemplating eating our way through the menu. (Just to make sure that they don't have anything bad on their menu.)  And while the space is small, it is truly artfully and elegantly designed.  Tres chic!  I'm just sorry that I didn't take any pictures, but I was so hungry that I was almost completely finished with my meal before I realized that I didn't really get good photos.

Anyway, you must go and I think that you will be impressed."}
{"text":"Excellent ramen place and cocktail bar! I'm very excited for this place, and, talking to the front of house manager and others, it sounds like they've got a lot of great plans, such as expanding their already fantastic small plates selection. 

The renovation of the space, previously a bank, is very tasteful; we saw other diners asking their server to take a photo of them against the decor before they left.

Their small plates, by the way.. try the Spicy Karaage and Cha-Shu Bao.. At least the buns, but I really couldn't pick one over the other.

The dinner crowd seems light right now (from when my wife and I went for dinner), and, from what I gather, it's a superb lunch spot, but the place has every makings of a dinner spot hit as well. I'm hoping it is one, because I love the place and want to continue going back. Try it!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch after so much anticipation for a ramen place to be opening right down the street from my work. The space has a cool vibe with modern decor. I didn't get to try any drinks since I was at lunch but I am looking forward to trying the cocktails. The service was prompt and attentive. 

We both ordered the spicy pork belly ramen and I thought it could use a bit more salt and spices in the broth. The eggs that came in the ramen were awesome. It was the most flavor filled egg I've ever had. They need to put that same flavor in the broth. The rest of vegetables that came in the dish were good. 

I will definitely return and try something different next time. Great addition to downtown pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"The staff is awesome the decor is just as awesome and their happy hour menu was nice. I enjoyed I had high hopes for this place as it's now the only Ramen spot downtown. The bartender was super awesome and helpful when it came to being proactive and attentive. As I don't eat beef or pork and most of the ramen has pork marrow in it I went for the veggie Ramen and it wasn't what I thought it would be. The noodles were good, the vegetables were a nice touch but the broth was missing something. It didn't make the experience memorable. Will I go back for drinks and maybe appetizers? Yes! But the Ramen not so much. It's a nice after work spot with five dollar happy hour cocktails and half off apps."}
{"text":"I came here before going to the Opera and I did not know what to expect. My friend who works down the street suggested it and I didn't have any other suggestion so we ended up here. I will say that it was A-OK. I would have to try more of their food other than the appetizers to truly get a good feel for it but all that we did was to eat some appys and to drink some drinks. 

The good thing about this place is that its happy hour specials are pretty great. The drink specials are $5 for some pretty good cocktails and half off appys. I will say that the drinks were strong and they were really good. I would never pay full price for them tho, the size of them alone would make me say, nah...too small for the original price. 

We sat at the bar and just ordered our food and our drinks from there. The service was interesting to say the least. Halfway through our time there the server at the bar switched over. The first server was really nice and talked to us about the champagne orders that were coming in and even let us try a sip of a bottle that was opened. I thought that was nice and would even go so far as to say I will be ordering that if I come back. That is the type of service that I really appreciate. He was prompt with our drinks, offered great suggestions and was very friendly. The second server that came on was prompt, was nice, and was friendly. But when asked for suggestions or just to chit chat he wasn't having much of it. He was super nice, but it was just a little different. It was getting busier by that time so he could have been distracted, but a little chit chat would have been nice. But I guess you never know as a server what is too much and what might be enough. 

Drinks: 
Brown Derby: Bourbon/Honey/Grapefruit. This was really good. It came in a short squat glass filled with ice. I liked that the bourbon taste was diluted a bit with the honey and the citrus. It felt to me that it just didn't bite as much as usual. I would get this again. It was a bit stronger so I would say that I could only drink one of these and had to move to another. 

Honeysuckle: Rum/ Honey/Lime. Hmm do I see a pattern here? I just realized that I went with another drink with honey and citrus and just switched up the liquor. I guess I know what I like! This one was very good. It wasn't overly strong and was smooth going down. Rum is and easier drink to consume because it is basically a fruit. Or at least that is what I consider it. I would get this one again. 

Moscow Mule: Vodka/ Ginger Beer/ Lime. I just tasted this because my friend got it and after two drinks myself, I was done. It tasted like a moscow mule. Nothing fancy, just crisp and refreshing. I don't know if I would pick this as my go to drink, but it was good, a bar staple. 

Take Things Slowly: Gin/Lavender/Lemon. Again my friend picked this drink and I just had a few sips. I liked it a lot. I am not the biggest lavender fan but it had a really nice taste to it. Refreshing and cool. I do not know if I would get it because again, the lavender taste could get to me after a bit. But a few sips was nice, and if you can handle lavender this is the drink for you. 

The drinks were really good and I would say for $5, that is a good way to spend an hour or two hanging out with friends and sipping some cool ones. 

Now on to the appys!!

Appetizers:
Seasonal Vegetable Tempura soy-dashi vinaigrette /ask server for daily veggies. This is the part where the second server made me laugh and shake my head. We asked what the daily veggies were and he was like..\"they are good, just get them, I don't know what they are, maybe sweet potatoes, carrots, and beans.\" It was really good. The soy dashi vinaigrette was phenomenal. The veggies were sweet potatoes, green beans, carrots, zucchini, and mushroom.  I really liked picking at this bowl. The tempura was thin enough that the breading wasn't over kill and then was still crispy enough to make an impression. The veggies were fried to perfection, not overly soggy and had a nice crunch to them still. But the star was that dipping sauce!!

Gyoza (6): pork / cabbage / dumplings / onions / scallions soy-ginger vinaigrette. Ok, confession, we ordered two of these. Yes, we ate 12 dumplings. They were good. The normal gyoza fair. They tasted just as I expected and not anything more or less. The sauce was really good too. I liked the veggie one better but still. This was a nice snack, so nice, we ordered that second dish. I liked that they were made perfectly with a little bit of the pan frying and the steamed. It makes me want to go out and get a bag and have a little gyoza night. 

Chicken Bao (2)pulled chicken / japanese aioli / bib lettuce  steamed bun. I would pass on these if I had the choice. I picked these, and actually it was my choice, because I have been eating a lot of pulled pork and wanted to do something different than the pork baos. These were a bit dry for my taste. I dipped them in the vinaigrette!!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time for lunch on a Friday.  I ordered the salt and pepper tofu and the veggie ramen.  Total was around $18 (not including tip).

What's Hot
- Quality.  Yummers!  The broth is nicely flavored and seasoned.  For ramen, a nicely seasoned broth is super important.  Not too salty.  There's some pepper in the broth and green scallions, as well, which adds a nice kick.  Their veggie ramen has the tasty button mushrooms (not the regular western white mushrooms), tofu (which is probably pan fried) and pieces of seaweed.  Some of their ramen options come with a boiled egg, which looks like it's been slightly marinated/stewed, which adds to the flavor.  My friend's ramen came with bak choy.  It's nice to see they're including truly Asian veggies/sides in their dishes.  Their salt and pepper tofu appetizer is slightly breaded and fried, but not overly so.  It's nicely flavored- not too salty- and there's a slight kick.  For me, it's important that fried food isn't overly/thickly battered.  That usually means there's less flavor and you may be trying to hide something.  
- Variety.  There's something for everyone- vegetarian and non vegetarian, ramen dishes, stir fries with rice, etc...  
- Price.  Veggie ramen is $11 and the salt and pepper tofu is $6.  Without tip, that's under $20, which isn't so bad.
- Location.  It's a convenient location in downtown and within walking distance of many places.  Because it's downtown, be prepared to walk here.
- Service.  It was good and not bad, but be prepared for slowdowns when it's busy.      

What's Not
- Reservation.  This is only bad for those who do not know you really do need a reservation.  That you need a reservation means this place is popular and does well, so be prepared.  My friend made a reservation for a Friday lunch, people.  When we arrived, they couldn't find the reservation, but were able to find a table for us in the back.  My friend said the restaurant may have lost her reservation, because she made it too early.  Early??  Uh, she made the reservation one week ago.  How is that too early?  It looks like this place gets busy fast, especially during the weekdays.  
- Portions.  Their ramen is a decent size, but it's small.  It's not enough to get full.  If you're looking for a fully satisfying meal, in terms of portions, I recommend you order their stir fries.    

Final Answer
Willing to come back, but make a reservation!"}
{"text":"This is such a great place to have cocktails and enjoy delicious food. The ambiance is very nice with low lights and cool art decor. Great selection of Japanese cocktails and spirits, possibly the most varied drinks on the menu I have seen so far."}
{"text":"This is the Ramen I have enjoyed most in Pittsburgh. It has a creamy broth. The ambiance of the restaurant was warm and comfortable. I plan to return."}
{"text":"Wow! This restaurant is just what Pittsburgh needs. After eagerly anticipating the opening (watched the construction for months), we were so pleasantly surprised. It's an intimate venue with a long bar, interesting and beautifully carved tables for larger groups and cozy tables in the back.  The happy hour is a terrific bargain with lots of drink options and really tasty appetizers.  The ramen cannot be beat--a far cry from my college days of noodle packets! 

Jeffrey, Jack, Alec and Alice have all made our visits special with wonderful & attentive service. Kudos to them! The chef is always personable & comes to say hello and check on your meal. 

My tip: leave Market Square, go around the corner and discover this great addition to Pittsburgh's vibrant restaurant scene."}
{"text":"Me and friends came over here for dinner. I always see it but never get a chance to try it until now. we came here on a Friday night, it's actually not packed at all. We were seated right away. The waiter was attentive at first, however, in the middle of our meal our waiter just stopped checking on us. After awhile, there was another waiter that came check on us instead. We ran out of water for awhile, he never filled our water so we eventually asked for more water. It's not a big deal really. Our first waiter might just really needed to leave. Anyway, I was excited that they have stir fry Raman. I ordered chicken Raman, my boyfriend ordered a curry dish, and our friends got Raman. They all love their dishes. However, I wasn't a fan of mine at all. It tastes like Americanized chinese Raman. I couldn't quite tell which flavor is too strong, maybe it's sesame oil. I was disappointed everyone likes their dish but me. I think I will come back again if I get a chance, but I'll have to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"TL;DR- bad service, bad food, unclean bathroom.

My boyfriend and I arrived at this restaurant 15-20 minutes before the rest of our party arrived, so we decided to order a couple cocktails. It wasn't especially busy in the restaurant, but it took 30 minutes to get our drinks. By the time we got our drinks the rest of the party had arrived and had been seated for enough time to look over the menu and drink menu. Another member of our party was interested in wine and ordered something off of the wine list. He was told that they had almost none of the wines on that list. As for the ramen, I tried the Yuzu shio ramen, their so called specialty. It was too spicy and you couldn't taste the ramen at all. The quality of ramen was less than I would get making frozen ramen at home. At the end of our meal I want to the bathroom, and it was disgusting. Looked like no one had been in to clean it for at least a few days. Will never come back."}
{"text":"Overall Impression:
A unique Japanese spot for lunch that has amazing ramen, a great happy hour menu, and a calm ambiance.

The Food:
I've eaten at this location on Wood Street twice so far, and it's nice to have a restaurant that serves authentic ramen, as it's hard to come by west of Downtown Pittsburgh. In my most recent visit, my group of 3 ordered the Salt and Pepper Tofu and Edamame as an appetizer. The S&P Tofu exceeded my expectations and was fried to a perfect consistency with a pleasantly creamy inside. The Edamame was good, but not my cup of tea. The others in my group seemed to enjoy it more than I did.

For my meal, I ordered the Rayu (Chili Oil) Paitan (White Broth) Ramen and Chicken Yellow Curry (for leftovers). The curry dishes don't have a scale for their spice level--they only come as is, so if you don't enjoy heavy spice I'd order something different. The chicken was moist and the yellow curry sauce had a depth of both spice and sweetness. The ramen became the shining star of my evening--pork belly cooked perfectly, broth with a pleasant kick, noodles firm. I had eggs, shitake mushrooms, and corn also mixed in, all wonderful additions.

The Restaurant:
Dimly lit with a direct view of the half-open kitchen, my table always had a carafe of water (how fancy) and chopsticks for everyone to eat with. The waitress was a college student who was both pleasant and knowledgeable about their menu items. She immediately directed us to their happy hour cocktails and appetizers, and we all got at least one drink. The prices for HH were very reasonable! Everything is very clean and well decorated to fit the Japanese style--I especially like their tableware. The greeter was also smiling, wishing us a good night as we left.

TL;DR
Yuzu is my go-to for Ramen in the Downtown Pittsburgh area that provides a well-worth it happy hour and Japanese-style experience. Even if you don't like tofu, just try it, it might change your mind on tofu forever!"}
{"text":"Please give them time for transition before eating here. 

I have good news and bad news about YuZu. The bad news is that they are not good right now. All the food was flavorless especially the ramen. It was also expensive. Bad food at high prices. They also discontinued the Robata grill. This was a big disappointment as it was the reason we went.

The good news is that YuZu is under going a transition. They will be having a buffet and bubble tea. I hope they use this chance to make better food.

The second star is because the service was good."}
