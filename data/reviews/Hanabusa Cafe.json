{"text":"Great food, a little pricey. But that's what you get for trying a novel food in the Toronto market- you have to pay a little more for it. 

Hanabusa could benefit from some additional signage at the front. From the get-go, it's not very obvious how the cafe works. Basically you have to wait to be seated, but you have to order and pay (and tip) prior to sitting down because they don't have wait staff. Some patrons didn't understand the system and didn't bother to ask, so they rushed to grab an \"available\" table while others were waiting in line. A simple \"please wait to be seated\" sign would suffice and clear up a lot of confusion for patrons. 

From a food standpoint, it's all delicious and very representative of the Japanese souffle pancakes that are served in Japan. It's like the Uncle Tetsu equivalent but in pancake form. All of the sweetness levels are toned down per Asian tastes- so don't come here and expect a sugar high. I did feel it was a little expensive for what it was- especially if you get a drink as well. 

I've tried it and satisfied my curiosity but I probably wouldn't come back. The recipe is easy enough that I can make this at home."}
{"text":"Their Japanese souffle pancake look airy and fluffy (fuwa fuwa)!  We 3 girls shared the Earl grey caramel and the Custard.  Our favorite is the custard souffle pancake.  It is instagrammable and taste divine!  
It worth the 30 minutes waiting time~  We will definitely revisit!"}
{"text":"These soufflé pancakes are just ok, the toppings are what makes the pancake have some flavor. Although they are very soft and have a nice texture

The hype about this place was a bit too much. They opened recently and you can tell.., the place is small so if you come and have to wait for an hour or so, don't do it cuz it's not really worth the wait."}
{"text":"Ordered the Original Pancake. Suuuuuper Fluffy and airy. Fresh fruits. Real whipped cream.
Got the Flat White as well nice and strong.

The interiors are modern and cute. Very clean. Reminds me of a very girly bedroom haha
Lots of instagramable moments and areas. 

Very sweet servers. Kind and generous.

I wish them all the best."}
{"text":"Honestly, kinda disappointed by this place. Had pretty high expectations because of all they hype around japanese pancakes, and don't get me wrong, they were good, but definitely not filling. Because they're so light and airy, you feel like you didn't eat anything. I got the matcha pancakes and my friend got the custard ones. They came out at different times which really wasn't great. I tried to wait for her plate to come out before eating mine but it got to the point where my pancakes were getting cold and hers still hadn't come out yet. That was definitely a strike in my books. 

Overall, taste was pretty good and the inside decor is cute (though the space isn't big), but for the price and the wait time (almost an hour for both of our pancakes to come out) it's not really worth it in my opinion."}
{"text":"I was super excited about this cafe as I love soufflé. One word to describe this place is perfection. You make your order at the cashier upon arrival before seating yourself. I would suggest to come at odd hours like I did (around 2pm) because there wasn't a wait; lucked out on getting a table right away as this cafe is very small. 

Service:
We were greeted right away by friendly staffs. They brought us water and utensils when we found our table. For soufflé, I expected a longer wait for food but to my surprise, our order came pretty quick (approx. 10 minutes) which is amazing! 

Food:
We ordered the original pancake which comes with three fluffy patties, whip cream, strawberries, and blueberries. It was so light, fluffy, and delicious! I like that it wasn't too sweet. Using a knife was not even necessary because it was just that soft. Every bite was perfection and I love having all the toppings together in one bite with the pancake.

Presentation:
Looks delicious and fluffy just like how it should be.

Price:
It came up to approximately $16 after tax and there's also a tip option. I feel that the price is fair and around the average. 

Atmosphere:
Love the interior design of this place. Marble table tops and gold metal chairs plus their utensils were also gold which just matches the theme. They have plants which I believe are fake just for decor but it gives you this nice comfy feel. It's a tiny place for sit in with limited seats (approx. 25 seats). For those of you who love to take pictures, it's definitely a cute place and can possibly get some Instagram worthy pictures. 

Overall, I enjoyed my experience. I wish I can have this all the time so hopefully they will open one up in Markham in the near future. Going downtown is a trek for me but it is still worth it."}
{"text":"The waiting time is long (as expected since it's the first day lol), but the taste is sooooo uniqueee. I tried the green tea and my husband tried the original, both of them have crumbly textures with strong flavours. It is the most toothsome pancake I have ever tasted in Toronto. I will definitely bring my friends in again! but next time I hope more staffs will be hired to shorten the waiting time!"}
{"text":"Cozy space, cute decor, lovely pancakes. I wouldn't wait in line for an hour for them, and that's why I went on a gloomy afternoon. I ordered and was seated right away, and the pancakes took about fifteen minutes to arrive. I had the taro pancakes, and they were light and delicate with subtle flavours, which I really appreciated. Often you get the overly sweet taro flavouring at other places, but they make their own taro purée here.

The place is clean and charming, a nice new spot to catch up with somebody in. The service is friendly and attentive, even if the actual cooking is a tad on the slow side. Come here when you're wandering around Kensington and want to sit down and relax for a while."}
{"text":"LUNCH


As soon as you come in you place your order at the cashier counter, they give the waitress a number and she leads you to your seat in the cafe.

After being seated the pancake took about 15-20 mins to make and be served. So expect that if you plan on coming and are tight on time.

Ordered the original pancake option but I did ask the guy at the cashier which was the most popular and he suggested the custard pancake. 

Overall I wasn't too impressed by the soufflé pancake. It tasted good but did not make me feel like it was worth the $17(tip included) price tag. The fruit was also morsel and it felt a little cheaply placed. It also fell short of the soufflé pancakes we tried in Japan. Sorta like how the Pablo here does not compare with the ones in Japan. 

Will possibly return to try the \"popular\" custard pancake to see if that is any good but after this visit.. won't make it priority."}
{"text":"Another Japanese inspired food craze comes to Toronto and it doesn't disappoint! We tried the Jasmine tea and custard flavored pancakes and boy were they delicious! They were beautifully placed and tasted light and fluffy - it's like what'd you get if you could sous vide a thick pancake! Definitely worth a visit if you're in the Kensington area. I give it a HLIW (how long I'd wait) score of 30 min!"}
{"text":"Was absolutely looking forward to come to Hanabusa cafe.  First time I had souffle pancake was in Japan last year and it blew me away.  It was a life changing experience.  How can no one tell me about it for so long.   So I was craving and dying for to taste it again.  Than I found out they coming to the 6ix quickly, like when 5-6 poke bowls took over.  I know 3 places serve souffle pancakes here now and there could be more.  But my goal is to try them all.  

Hanabusa was quite busy when we got there, line ups were to the sidewalk. I guess our wait was around 20 mins so wasn't too bad.  I ordered the matcha and chocolate as well.  The pancake itself wasn't as fluffy as the one in Japan.  One taste and I was highly disappointed. Texture was off and wasn't sweet enough.  Didn't taste that good to be honest maybe that is why they gave us matcha and chocolate sauce.  Overall it was a disappointment to me since I had the real deal in Japan.  My friend that never had it before liked more so.  The staff their is very friendly have a very Japanese feel to it and even bow to me when I thanked them."}
{"text":"Pancakes just melt in your mouth. So easy to eat and a great dessert when having a friend gathering"}
{"text":"Lots of Japanese pancake places have been opening up so I had to see what all the hype was about.

Came here on the weekend to be honest it wasn't that long of a wait. Lined up was about 10 minute to get seated and another 10-15 minute to get our pancakes so it wasn't bad. 

I decide to go for their matcha pancake as well as their crème brûlée too. I have to say these were like the best Japanese pancakes I have tried and tasted. They were so fluffy plus they didnt taste like egg at all like some places I have been to. 

Would definitely come back again and try out their other pancakes !"}
{"text":"I would say it's around a 3.5 out of 5. 

I got there at 4:30 and there was a small line up. It was about a 20-ish minute wait to get to the counter to order and another 20-ish minutes until we got our food. I got the Elderflower Iced Tea and the Jasmine Tea Pancakes. 

The Elderflower ice tea was ok. It's basically a tea base with ginger ale poured in. It tasted a lot like lychee to me but you mostly get the ginger ale/carbonated taste. Worth a try, but wouldn't get this again.

Compared to my friend's Chocolate Pancakes, I found that they didn't use a lot of the Jasmine Tea sauce at all (only a few spoonfuls). The jasmine taste wasn't very strong either, which was a letdown. However, the pancakes themselves were delicious - super fluffy and light. I like the eggy/butter flavour and it pairs well with the sweeter whipped cream.

Overall, I enjoyed it though I wouldn't get the pancakes with Jasmine sauce again as the flavour wasn't strong or noticeable. With 3 pancakes, I didn't feel particularly full and both my friend and I agreed that it's pretty much a \"snack\" rather than a meal.

Elderflower Iced Tea: 3/5
Jasmine Pancake: for the sauce, 2.5/5 and for the pancakes, 5/5"}
{"text":"TL;DR Waste of money, time, hopes and dreams are dead. Service does not understand english, unorganized, and inconsistent. Allergies don't matter. AVOID COMPLETELY.

Let's get right to the point. NO.

FOOD 0/100000000
They served very instagram worthy but proved to be clickbait food. Spend money elsewhere.

Soggy pancakes and seperating custard sauce YIKES.

Also I recieved my pancakes about 30 mins after ordering, my friend got hers 30 mins after I FINISHED EATING MINE, unfortunate.

SERVICE 1/9000 
(DOES NOT CARE IF YOU HAVE ALLERGIES AND IF YOU DIE)

They didn't understand that I had a strawberry allergy for about 10 minutes until I started describing 'death' and 'hospital' and even then they asked around if anyone knew what I was talking about.

Didn't matter anyways because my food was already contaminated. They kept touching everything with the same gloves on which very much quite defeats the purpose of wearing gloves.

It's like why wear gloves if you're going to touch everything with them on???

Now my throat is itchy and closing up so a Rexall is where I shall head to next.

ATMOSPHERE is very cafe-esque nothing special.

PLEASE FIX YOUR SERVICE OTHERWISE YOU GUYS WILL SUFFER AS I HAVE SUFFERED WITH MY MORE COMMON THAN NORMAL ALLERGY OF STRAWBERRIES.

USE SPOONS OR SOMETHING TO SCOOP THEM ONTO THE DAMM PLATE TO AVOID CROSS CONTAMINATION.

CURSE YOU FOR RUINING MY DAAAAAAAAAAAY."}
{"text":"Our original plan was to be at Hanabusa at the time of opening, however, we slept in and arrived at around noon instead. As expected, we saw a queue outside of the shop, and the wait was approximately 45 minutes or so. As we were waiting, we could see the fluffy pancakes being cooked by the window. Before we placed our orders at the counter, the staff mentioned that the pancakes will take another 30 minutes, so be prepared that there is still a bit of a wait after getting a table. Our bill came to just below $50 for 2 pancakes and 2 drinks. Service was friendly and the waitress always had a smile on her face. 

Jasmine Tea Pancake - The thick souffle pancakes were cooked perfectly, with a light airy texture and a strong egg flavour, which I enjoyed a lot. However, we found the house made jasmine tea sauce to be on the sweet side. 

Custard Souffle Pancake - We preferred the custard pancakes over the other, as the burnt sugar on top added a slight crisp and rich caramel flavour. 

The hot latte and iced Kyoto matcha were decent, nothing to rave or complain about.

Overall, the pancakes were good, but with wait times of over an hour, we won't be in any hurry to return. Also, this is just personal preference, but neither of us were too excited about the fact that the entire dish had a similar texture, where all components were soft and mushy."}
{"text":"Access
I actually came here with a friend after the big AGO event on Infinity Mirrors. If you are driving, there's a Green P lot in Kensington Market and pricing is fair. If you plan to TTC, the closest station is St. Patrick's - approximately 15 minutes of walking (or 10 if you speed walk LOL).

Service
Let me warn you, they are super disorganized. The person managing the place was super nice but crap, someone needs to teach them marketing and communication skills lols. To begin, the place is super small and the interior designer sucks balls because why would you have such a big empty corner outside the washroom?! Install another bar table and get rid of  the dingy desk where you store extra water cups lols. And who uses paper cups, just buy a dishwasher or hire a dish-washing staff member so you use the proper stuff! I mean, the decor is so nice, your utensils are heavy, and everything looks great, WHY THE PAPER CUPS? We were very lucky and only waited 20 minutes or so, but the person before us ordered takeout and the cafe forgot to give them 2 orders (they only gave 1 lols). Like they really need to get their act together, hire me, I'll get everything done for you in 1 month (I promise). I don't want to keep ranting but you get the picture, come back 3 months later!

Food
While the cafe is probably considered a noob in service, this place offers the best pancakes in all of Toronto hands down. Someone give them an applause because my friend and I engulfed all 3 pancakes in a matter of seconds (I kid you not). It was so damn fluffy, and the flavour we got was Earl Grey. Holy crap, I do not know how they made the sauce taste so good. My friend noted that it ends with some bitterness and the pancakes were not overly sweet so it was the perfect combination. You don't even need a knife to cut the thing up, it's SO SOFT! Obviously I don't know how the other flavours taste so I can't make a comparison, but for Earl Grey alone, I'd come back. The food is astounding, but I can totally relate to other reviewers regarding poor service. If you are someone who needs to eat peacefully and hate line-ups, come during their down time (so no weekends)."}
{"text":"Kensington Market just got a new resident and it surely impresses the taste buds. We back and eating more than ever! 
________
Check out these stacks of Creme brûlée soufflé pancakes, Matcha  & Taro - yea you have no idea how good this tastes until you dig in. Love the generous 3 pancakes - enough to share - but I didn't share. Killed it and wanting more. 
_________
Flavourwise is not that sweet. The creme brûlée sauce + the sugar crust = the combination created a really pleasant mouthfeel , texture of the pancake itself is of course light and fluffy and moist - you can taste a hint of vanilla. The acidity of the strawberries and blueberries help cut the richness of the sauce perfectly.

Top 3 favourites: Taro, Matcha (Sauce is made with Matcha imported from Kyoto, Japan) and of course the Creme brûlée.

Bit of a wait since they are new on the block - worth the wait. Also order the Elder Flower Tea! Quench your thirst on the hot days to come!"}
{"text":"Delicious soufflé pancakes. Definitely worth a try. Cozy atmosphere, perfect for a few insta worthy photos. Staffs were nice and kind. Will be back in the future to try other flavours."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend on a Friday afternoon and it was very busy! While there was no line ups, there were also no tables available so we sat on the side bar table with the high stools. Overall, the staff is very nice and accommodating especially since the power went out that day (there was a storm). Despite the power outage, they remained calm and was profusely apologizing to all the customers who were already seated and the ones waiting in line. Of course without power, they were unable to make their delicious pancakes. Luckily for us, they had just finished our order when the power went out. 

The excellent customer service definitely made the food taste better. There was such a welcoming and warm atmosphere to enjoy our food and the lighting was actually quite nice -- even when the lights were out. ;) 

I likes how jiggly the pancake was and the fruits on the side were definitely a good pairing for the early gray sauce on top of our pancakes. The lattes were also very delicious -- especially the matcha and I would highly recommend coming here. I would definitely return to try the other flavours and enjoy my pancakes when the lights are on. ;)"}
{"text":"So tasty! 
Fluffy fluffy pancakes that are not too sweet and very very delicious. I went with a friend and we shared some chocolate pancakes. I also had a matcha latte, it was rich and not too sweet. This place won't leave you feeling sick and gross after eating here.

Everything in the cafe is instagramable. The lighting is good and the decor beautiful."}
{"text":"Hanbusa for sure changes my attitude to the new pancake hype.  At first I wasn't too interested thinking it was just some gimmicky food.  Since I was at Kensington Market and walked past the store with no line up, we decided to give it a try.  There was just a brief wait before we got seated.  We ordered 2 flavours, jasmine tea (limited quantity each day) and lemon custard (seasonal - June).  The pancake was heavenly and fluffy - especially jasmine tea one!  I found the lemon one a bit too much, still not too bad.  It is a very cute little cafe with IG-worthy decors.  The price is a bit on a higher end for pancakes so it's just gonna be once in awhile thing for me."}
{"text":"Who wants bouncy, jiggly, IG-worthy pancakes? You know I do! Tucked into a small 500 ish sq ft space in Kensington Market, this cafe is memorable for many reasons: Long lines, cute decor, and of course the deliciously fluffy Japanese style pancakes.  Yes, they are made to order so you're gonna be waiting 30-60 mins for your pancakes to come out. I went about a week after they opened and here are my thoughts. 

TL;DR conclusions are...

Pros:
- Cute decor 
- IG-worthy food 
- Pancakes are not overly sweet
- Pancakes have a fluffy texture 
- Earl Grey and Custard sauces are slammin'
- Pancakes are made to order, so they're fresh 

Cons:
- Long wait time (approx. 30-60 mins)
- Cups had lint or little bits floating in our water (even after we asked for new cups) 
- Staff doesn't check up on you (approach them yourself) 
- Very small volume of sauce (if you like drenching your pancakes this will be disappointing)
- Seating is appropriate for groups of 2 

If you're fine with a long wait and limited seating, I highly recommend you to visit this cafe. The pancakes are stellar and you're sure to like them if you're already fond of Japanese style cheesecake."}
{"text":"The pancakes there were amazing! I really love the sauce and the fluffy taste of pancake! We waited for 30min, a little slow, but the taste is good. I'll come back again later."}
{"text":"Very fluffy.. \"it's sooo fluffy, I'm gonna die\" this is how I feel about the pancakes. 

You order from the cashier, and have to find your own seat. Of course, I send my mom to sit down. 
It gets a little confusing as they tell you to wait, and you think wait for them to sit me down or to order? Anyways, by default the lowest tip is 15% but they just deliver your plate to your table. You will have to get your own forks, and water. 

Overall, not too sweet and quite fluffy. Good experience."}
{"text":"Amazing soufflé pancakes, small portion sizes, subpar service. 

Known for their fluffy Japanese pancakes, Hanabusa has been all the rage. Obviously, as a fan of all things Japanese, I fully gave into the hype.

We arrived at 10:30am on a rainy Saturday and were the first in line. I would suggest doing the same or even earlier if it's nice out since the line become very long very quickly, and the restaurant can accommodate ~6 parties at a time.

You make your order at the counter. We ordered the Matcha Pancake, Custard Pancake (their most popular dish), and the Earl Grey Pancake, a seasonal item. As expected, the pancakes were soft like clouds. I loved the rich matcha sauce that went with the pancake as well! It was a bit overpriced for 3 small pancakes but for a novelty item, I'm happy to have tried it.

A sour note to our experience was the feeling that we were constantly being rushed, be it ordering at the counter or when enjoying your meal. Even though the server gave us space, I could always see her standing from a distance and waiting for us to leave."}
{"text":"Came here to eat on a Thursday afternoon. Unfortunately they were closed for an \"private event\" with no notice ANYWHERE. There was no sign on the door and the doors were open. We came all the way from Markham to try this restaurant and it was so disappointing. There were clearly seats available in the restaurant and they chose not to serve us."}
{"text":"Hanabusa Cafe is a Japanese souffle pancake house located in Kensington Market. They are located next door to Dirty Bird Chicken & Waffles.

They are the first to offer the Japanese souffle pancake in Toronto. Japanese souffle pancakes are more airy, lighter and fluffier than your traditional pancake.  

I went on a recent Saturday afternoon after seeing some pictures of the Japanese souffle pancakes online. You order the souffle pancakes at the cashier, you are given a number and they bring the order to your table. The whole process of waiting in line until we were seated and receiving our souffle pancakes took about 45-50 minutes. We ordered the matcha pancake ($14.99 plus tax) which consisted of premium Kyoto matcha sauce, sweet azuki bean, strawberry, blueberry, whipping cream and caramel syrup over 3 souffle pancakes.

The souffle pancakes were beautifully presented, definitely instagram worthy, nice light and fluffy. Really nicely flavoured even though the inside was a little bit soggy and seemed to be a bit undercooked inside. 

Hanabusa Cafe has a really cool and interesting product and is a great addition to Kensington Market. It's definitely priced at the higher end point of the pancake market in Toronto but it's an item worth trying but be prepared for long lineups especially on the weekends and as the weather gets warmer."}
{"text":"This is a really small and cute cafe right next to Dirty Bird Chicken and Waffles in Kensington Market. My friend and I got there on a Saturday afternoon at around 2:30pm and the line up was out the door. Although there are not many people in line, they do not take further orders unless they have tables available to sit. This causes some issues as the gentleman in front of me in line wanted pancakes merely for take out, only to be angered by the fact that he was waiting in a line moving at a speed based on table availability. 

We got the Earl Grey Caramel Pancakes to share and the sauce that it comes with is absolutely amazing! The pancakes were very light and fluffy and fun to eat, but for around $15, they were not very substantial in portion size. It definitely left us feeling unsatisfied and craving more.

When we were first getting our order taken, there were only seats available on the bar, but the employees there were nice enough to suggest to let us know once table seating opens up. Although it was very busy, they still did well fulfilling our needs!


Taste: 4.5/5
Value: 3.5/5
Service: 4/5"}
{"text":"HUGE disappointment.  For the expensive price of $17 they charge for their soufflés, I was expecting quality in both appearance and taste.  My niece and I ordered two of their summer specials - the custard soufflé and the pineapple coconut.  

First of all, the plating was completely sloppy.  It looked like vomit.  And they gave very little fruits - considering each dish costs $17, I was expecting a little more fruit than what we got - this is a stark contrast from other pictures I have seen before and completely different from pictures on their own website.

Secondly, the taste was so mushy as the batter of the soufflé was undercooked.  I could not even finish my plate.

I can not believe they can charge $17 for a plate that looks like diarrhea.

Thirdly, their customer service is very amateur.  As it was our first time, when my niece and I entered we asked how it works and whether we can order first.  Another customer who came in after us was helped by another attendant and then was ushered to a table before us!  This is not right as we arrived ahead of the other customer!

Due to all the hype, they have decided it is okay to go downhill on the quality and only interested in taking your money.

It was not even busy as it was July 1st and Kensington Market was quiet and most people have went out of town.  So they were not even rushed.  They simply don't care about their quality or customer service and they absolutely do not care about having you return as a customer.  Not only will I not be returning, I will be telling about my experience on all my social media feeds and to my all my food blogger friends.

Repeat: Definitely No!"}
{"text":"Hanabusa, at the time of this writing, is under \"soft opening\". Their grand opening is April 15. This is my take on this cafe's 7th day of operation. 

Soft opening done right
Soft opening gives the business a chance to open and refine their operation before the official opening. They have started with offering their signature soufflé pancakes and drinks. Other desserts are not available until the official opening. That's smart. People are coming and lining up for soufflé like mindless zombies so there is a need to figure out how to feed everyone as best they can. Day 1 opened with taking orders while people are seated. On day 7, I placed my orders first, then found myself a seat and wait for pancakes to be served via a number system.  Hanabusa saw what didn't work for them early on and changed.

Beautiful interior
Clean. Simple. Modern. IKEA-ish. White walls with small plant decorations. Marbled tables with gold legs. Matching gold chairs with white cushion. Neon signs with seats underneath. Get your phones out!!!

Them soufflé pancakes
Ordered the earl grey caramel pancake. It's a new flavor in place of the jasmine tea one (one that I wanted to try but no longer offered at this time). You get 3 light, soft and jiggly pancakes on each plate. The pancakes alone is really good and can be had on its own. The caramel sauce is sweet as expected; the earl grey flavor comes through after. 
I was told there are plans to offer seasonal flavors in the future ( Sakura may be one of them). 
Get your phones out!!

Service
They tried to make the long wait for pancakes as least painful as possible. There was a number attached to each order. We had the option of either sitting down and waiting, or place our order, go for a walk, and come back in about an hour's time (roughly how long they estimate the orders to be fulfilled) and take a seat then.
Service afterwards was pretty standard and friendly. 

The elephant in the review
The elephant being the long line and long wait. It took some 30min to move from outside the store to ordering. With 3  griddles, each cooking 6 pancakes, I can see why it takes so long to complete each order. It took about an hour to get my pancakes, which is what the staff had previously warned us while in line.  If you had ordered more than one pancake, they will likely come at different times.

There are room for improvements and I'm sure they will figure out. They gave me a pretty good first impression and will be back to try other flavors."}
{"text":"The pancake was very fluffy and taste good
But the waiting was just out of rages...
We waited like over 45mins just to grab seats and order the food. And need to wait another 10-15mins for the food to be served...
Overall I don't think it was worth my time and energy! Which I can get this in Asia quite easily without any wait at all lol
Short time wouldn't go back to visit! :) 
But if you are living in Toronto and never tried this type of \"dessert\" before(or never planning to go Asia to travel any sooner). Then I would still recommend you to go try it out:)"}
{"text":"Honestly, a little disappointed in the pancakes as I love the souffle pancakes from Japan and was so excited that they finally had one here! 

We were a group of five and  waited for about an hour right when they opened at 11am. By the time it was our turn, they said there were no more meal pancakes and no more azuki beans.This was surprising to us because they just opened!  Pancakes were okay. It wasn't bad, but not great either. Flavour was good..light and not too sweet. Texture was kind of soggy though, compared to the ones I had in Japan. We ordered the chocolate, Jasmine tea, custard, and original. The sauces that accompany it were the only difference and they were good. Not too sweet. Jasmine, however, had no Jasmine flavour. It was tasty on its own but I actually forgot it was supposed to be Jasmine tea flavour.

Service was good. The servers were all polite and friendly, as you would expect from a Japanese own establishment.

Overall, it was okay. I liked the souffle pancakes in Japan more and I feel like there are better pancakes elsewhere in Toronto. Worth a try for others. I would return, but it wouldn't be something I crave."}
{"text":"That might be the best dessert I've ever had. The fresh pancakes were soft and fluffy. whipped cream had a perfect sweetness and texture to it. Simple presentation with fresh fruits that added to the flavors and not just for aesthetics. Service was five stars."}
{"text":"After having experienced soufflé or jiggly pancakes in Osaka, I wondered why they didn't make them in Canada. Fast forward to a year later, Hanabusa Cafe  (which specializes in soufflé pancakes) has opened up in Kensington Market. I went with my sister in law who was keen to try it as she missed the opportunity when she was in Japan.

You order your food at the counter and then sit down. The area near the counter has some bar top seating areas and really cute chairs but potentially could get crowded if there are a lot of people waiting for takeout orders. The gold details throughout the restaurant were very feminine and fresh. There is a cute poem spelled out in lights on one of the walls which I'm certain will get coverage on Instagram.

We ordered the matcha soufflé pancakes as well as the original soufflé pancakes. It took about 20 minutes for the order of original pancakes to come out. They were light in texture and had a lightly sweetened taste. They were served with pieces of fruit and whipped cream. I was slightly disappointed that they were not served as a stack of pancakes to highlight the delicate jiggly texture of this style of pancakes.

When the matcha pancakes finally arrived, visually they were very eye catching. The matcha sauce had a dark green appearance and a good strong matcha flavour. However because the delicate soufflé pancakes were partially soaked in matcha sauce, they lost some of the contrast of textural firmness on the pancake's exterior that the time on the griddle provides. The overall effect was a soggier, eggier pancake which was much less appealing than the original pancakes. Perhaps the option of matcha sauce on the side would help to remedy this textural issue.

It took nearly 30 minutes for us to receive the order of matcha pancakes. The manager or owner came to our table to explain that they had messed up our order of pancakes and thus had to remake them. I appreciated the fact that they were trying to maintain a quality standard and thus would not serve me broken pancakes. And in fairness they were only a few days into their soft opening. As a gesture of good will, he offered a discount on the order of takeout pancakes I had planned to order for my mother in law. I would suggest asking for the whipped cream on the side for takeout orders to avoid making the pancakes soggy.

The pancakes are not cheap. For the matcha and original pancakes, it came out to approximately $30. For that much money, I'd prefer to dine on more substantial food. That being said, there is a certain playfulness to this type of cuisine and to the cafe itself that would have me consider a return visit to try the custard pancakes, if for nothing else than to be able to jiggle the stack of pancakes."}
{"text":"Waste of money...
I was so disappointed.
Nothing special, taste was not good, and customer service was bad. 
Owner needs to train his/her employees."}
{"text":"I always wanted Toronto to have a Japanese Souffle Pankcakes spot and my dream finally came true thanks to Hanabusa Cafe!

Came here on a weekday around 3pm and this place was quite busy already! Since it was my first time here, I decided to just order the Original Japanese Pancake with a Kyoto Matcha Latte.  The latte came quickly but the Souffle Pancakes did take awhile, infact, almost 30 minutes and as a result, the happy face on my latte was melted already. =(

Despite the long wait, the Souffle Pancakes were REALLY good.  It was very fluffy, light and delicious and you have THREE of them!  These pancakes did remind me of the ones I had in HK from Pan de Pain although i will still give the slight edge to the ones in HK.  Still this is probably the best spot for Japanese Souffle Pancakes in Toronto.

If you want to come without a long wait, I recommend coming around 1-4 during a weekday or early on a weekend to avoid long lineup and wait time for the souffles.

{"text":"This little Japanese soufflé pancake cafe in Kensington Market was very busy on a Saturday morning. Myself and 3 other friends had arrived just before it opened at 11am (10:45am) and there were about 6 people ahead of us. Once the doors opened we ordered at the till and got a number and sat down. The decor is very cute and modern, overall appearance it is very appealing and clean. 

We ordered four different flavours - matcha, taro, jasmine tea and custard. The pancakes itself were all the same with different sauces. The pancake batter taste wise is good and not overly sweet. The texture wasn't quite right, it was too wet compared to traditional Japanese soufflé pancakes. 

We all ordered the Kyoto Matcha Latte which was very good. Not overly sweet and had a rich matcha flavour. 

Overall service was very good, we got water right when we sat down and got our drinks shortly after. Pancakes took a while since it was made when ordered. Given they had a line up before they opened they should have started making the pancakes before hand."}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday afternoon, the wait was about an hour long. It wasn't bad considering how long the line up was with limited amount of seating inside. The cafe is very snug and cozy with cute decor. 

I ordered the Taro pancake and my boyfriend ordered the Custard pancake. After we were seated we were given a glass of water and our orders came out quick, maybe a 10 minute wait.

The pancake portion was good, you get 3 rounds of fluffy pancake with fresh fruits and a dollop of cream. They're very fluffy and wobbly and more eggy tasting than a traditional pancake. The light texture of them made it really easy to eat.

The Taro sauce is made from real taro so it's a little heavy and mealy tasting from the natural texture of a ground-down taro root. The Custard sauce was delicious and caramelized at the top for a nice crunch. 

I think they weren't overly sweet and personally, I enjoyed the Custard pancake flavour just a bit more! It's yummy and worth a try if you are in the Kensington Market area!"}
{"text":"1 HOUR  15 MINUTES' WAIT FOR A FREAKIN TAKEOUT!!!!!

I know this is your first day of opening but give me a break, more than an hour wait for a pancake!!! This is even worse than the 30 minute wait I have to go through with Pablo's Cheesecake. At least in Pablo there's a long lineup so the long wait was understandable and justifiable.  But to make someone wait for more than an hour for a pancake makes me question the company's commitment to its customer. 

And what's up with this Japanese franchise companies, I believe they're doing it on purpose - make customer wait and unhappy. 

While I was waiting, I was watching the girl making the pancakes. They have 3 pancake griddles and for reason unknown she's only using 1 griddle, the other griddle she use to cook eggs. So what is the other griddle for? She only started using both griddles for pancakes when the lineup is becoming uncontrollable and by then people are getting pissed off. 

And aside from being pricey ($12 for 3 pancakes) there's nothing really special about them. The pancake was very bland and and all you can taste is fluffy and airy eggs, totally not worth the hype! Just another mediocre food that some Torontonians will be raving about."}
{"text":"Totally in love with this tasty pancakes, even my kids want go back again! Hope can opening another cafe in north York area."}
{"text":"Long lineup but not sure why there's a line up in the first place...
Ordered the matcha pancakes and had to over 15 mins. We were then directed to wait for a seat. 
The store was nicely decorated however no AC or fan. It was super hot and humid, not a comfortable space to eat.
Pancake was as advertised, very fluffy and had a very flavourful egg taste. I had thought the matcha was in the pancake however it was just a sauce."}
{"text":"Arrived around 12:45pm and there was a line up. It took about 5 mins to get seated which was great. Ambiance is cute and cozy; not a big place so line ups to be expected. I ordered the original with water as their drinks did not interest me. It took about 5 mins to receive my order which was great as I was in a rush. The pancakes tasted good not very eggy which was what I was afraid of. I would definitely recommend especially if you are in Kensington Market. Staff were friendly and attentive. All in all a good experience."}
{"text":"Absolutely divine! Visited on their second opening day, and there was no line and the pancakes were quickly served. I ordered the matcha pancakes which came with matcha sauce, azuki bean, fruits, and whipped cream. It came with three pancakes and they were pretty filling. 

The pancakes are incredibly light and fluffy, pairing well with matcha and fruits. The taste of egg is more prominent than your usual pancakes, making it a personal favourite. They were warm and reminded me of a Uncle Tetsu cheesecake texture and taste with less cheese of course.

I saw a few reviews complaining about the price and the \"poor service\" but I didn't relate to these. Their 20% discount was automatically included as well. These are also pretty hard to make at home and worth the price of about 14/15$.  

The café is well decorated with marble and gold detail, perfect for a date (or Instagram)! Downside is that they do not offer full service - you pay first and get your own water. That being said, I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place is very disorganized as you can see from their open kitchen. Some of the staff do not seem to know what they're doing. The taste of the pancakes were good after an hour wait time. They serve you water in paper cup. Not much service involved, you need to order and pay at the counter. Food taste good but there's a lot of room for improvement for this place."}
{"text":"My friend told me about these fluffy Japanese souffle-like pancakes and I had to try them. Luckily, they didn't disappoint! When you enter Hanabusa, you will see an ordering counter where you order and pay first. You are then given a ticket and led into the dining area to be seated. There is a small wait for the souffle pancakes, but it's worth it. My friend and I shared an order of the Savoury Caramel Earl Grey, which came with three pancakes that were light and delicious."}
{"text":"A welcome addition to the Toronto food scene, but fell short of expectations. $15~ for 3 pancakes.

Order and pay at the cashier. This system is still a little unorganized; customers, please pay attention to your order # being called!

A lot of the flavours I wanted were not available when I was there around 6:30pm on a weekday, and a lot of toppings (ie. banana) were crossed off the menu.  I had the Original and the Taro - same as original but with some fresh taro puree (yum). The first batch of pancakes were very wet, but the second one was fine. If you want super jiggly pancakes, this is not the place. I liked the whipped cream. 

Simple & cute décor and tableware -  great for pics."}
{"text":"The pancakes are amazing ! 
The only issues I found were the wait times, awkward seating situation and the fact that they ran out of all the other pancake flavours and was only able to offer 3 things on their menu. Other than that, the pancakes were great! Would definitely go again to try out the other flavours"}
{"text":"I like squishy and fluffy pancakes. The pancakes were soft and delicious! 

The bad part is the wait time. Expect to wait at least 30-40mins in line and then another 20mins for your pancake to be ready."}
{"text":"YUM. These pancakes are worth the hype. They're fairly large and taste great to boot. I gotta dock a star for those prices though. They're just too high for me to swing by regularly (which I so wish I could do). 

I really appreciate the effort gone into creating this place's ambience. In a place like Kensington, the decor, personal space, and cleanliness are GREATLY appreciated."}
{"text":"Finally we had a chance to try this cafe, their famous soufflé pancake.  There is a lineup 30 mins before they close for the day.  Some flavours are sold out already, left with original, chocolate or matcha.  We ordered chocolate pancake and caramel latte.  The pancake is soft and full of egg flavour. With the chocolate sauce, it is perfect!  The drink is very good, better than other cafe.  Recommend to try out the Japanese pancake as I will try other flavours again next time when I visit!"}
{"text":"The first time I heard of soufflé pancakes was through a YouTube video and I remember watching it with drool running down my chin, so once I heard that those famously fluffy Japanese pancakes were coming to Toronto I obviously had to make my way to Hanabusa. 

Arrived around 2 o'clock in the afternoon on their grand opening, and there was already a queue for seats. Waited for what seemed to be an eternity, but was really 30 minutes and got seated at the back where they can accommodate roughly 16 guests total, so don't expect to be seated right away if you come here as a large group. You can tell that the business was unprepared for the large turnout because servers were scrambling and you could overhear people complaining about wait times, missing cutlery, wiping tables, the WiFi password - the list goes on. However, the staff was extremely kind at all times and very apologetic about the chaos. Honestly, I'd give them a break there was so much going and I never saw them stop working I don't even think they got a break that day, but I digress.

It was the beginning of the day and they were already sold out of the matcha pancakes, and jasmine tea pancakes, so I ordered the custard pancakes and my friend ordered the original (don't). After fourty-five, YES, fourty-five lengthy, WiFi-less minutes, we finally received our pancakes. Mine was gorgeous - it did not mention in the menu that the custard pancake is brûléed on top which I think they should because who doesn't love a brûlée? After snagging a bunch of pics like that bodacious pancake was my own baby, I dove right in. The pancakes were as advertised: fluffy as fluff. The scorched sugar on top was crackly and had my favourite kind of toasted caramel flavour. The fresh fruits (strawberries and blueberries) on the side were great to cut back the rich, warm custard. Looking across the table to my friend, she seemed less pleased with her dish. It was plain. Three pancakes with whipped cream and fruit so they asked to steal some of my custard sauce heh. 

After finishing our pancakes in about 3 seconds, we went up to pay and received a 20% discount. Not sure if this was for the grand opening or the mayhem, but I'll take it. 

Overall, I'll probably come back in a few weeks when they're more comfortable. Until then, I hear there's another Japanese pancake house opening soon..."}
{"text":"Yay! These pancakes were really yummy

Matcha: The matcha sauce was underneath the pancakes and that was awesome because you could dip the pancake into it, or not as much so some bites had a really strong matcha flavour and others didn't. It was nice to have that variety of flavour. The matcha sauce itself was not sweet which I liked because everything else was sweet and the sauce balanced it out.

The whipped cream on top of the pancake was really airy and delicious, sweeter than the pancake. Having some whipped cream and some of the not-so-sweet matcha sauce together was really yummy

Pancakes were fluffy and light, a little eggy (yum). They weren't as sweet as I expected which was nice.  I ate every bite and was really full after so if you're not very hungry or having it as a meal than maybe share an order.

Wait time:  Since it just opened recently this place is hopping. We arrived on Sunday at 10:35am to wait for it to open at 11am. By 10:45 there were 30 people in line behind us, so if you do'nt have the patience to wait in line I reccommend just coming before they open and being one of the first to be served.

Inside: Very cute. Small seating area, mostly tables for 2. Only about 10 small tables. wouldn't be good for a group unless you're the first ones there that day."}
{"text":"The hype (especially on IG) for these fluffy pancakes made this a go-to for us on our visit to Kensington market! The cafe is super cute and clean. The staff are very friendly and efficient as well. The wait time when we got there on a late Saturday afternoon was about 15 minutes, so it's not too bad. We ordered 2 pancake platters - the jasmine tea and earl grey flavours for 4 of us. 

Each pancake platter cake with 3 fluffy pancakes, tons of sauce for the flavour and a side of berries. The pancakes themselves were light, fluffy and easy to eat. The sauces were what made it super special - mine was earl grey and I loved how it balances the sweet and the strong tea flavours in mine. The best part is they didn't leave me feeling super full and were not obsessively sweet! 

The price is a bit steep and you pay before you get seated, which was interested as you're expected to tip before you receive any service. 

Definitely a nice spot to check out once, especially if you've been walking around Kensington for a while and just need a breather. It's not something I would do regularly though.. so it's good as a one-off."}
{"text":"Do not come here if you are crunched on time!!!! They take forever making their pancakes. My family came in here and the line was a little out the door and we've been waiting for over an hour now just to order our food. We have been at the front of the line and they will not take our order until there is an open seats inside their cafe. On top of that, the workers all take their precious time making the products and do not have any sense of urgency at all. TLDR; do not come here unless you have a few hours to spare. If there is a line, don't bother."}
{"text":"Great fluffy pancakes!

Went with a group of friends we all got different flavour - matcha, custard, taro and Earl grey caramel.

The best one was matcha. Custard was good too but I felt the flavour was a bit bland. 

The Earl grey caramel was a bit too heavy, and the caramel over powered the earlgrey.

We got here at 11:30am and already there was a line. It took about 1.5 hours to get table and order. The line was pretty consistent through out the day. If possible it might be better to go on a week day.

Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Great pancakes, really loved the vibe of this place as well as the owners are some of the sweetest people. Really enjoyed my visit. Would def recommend the matcha pancakes if you're into matcha at all."}
{"text":"What a rip off! Most horrible experience i ever had. 
Seriously, i don't judge how it is delicious or not, but at least they have to make their pancakes properly to serve for customers. 

Waste of time, money, everything!  If they don't know how to make it good, at least make it look good!"}
{"text":"It's surely interesting to see more modern and upscale spots coming into Kensington such as Grey Gardens and Blackbird Baking Co., so  Hanabusa Cafe was sure a nice addition! 

I had been told that the cafe has an order and pay first system, then one would be seated based on availability of seats. With that system, it creates quite the line up as the spot isn't exactly spacious. I'd advise coming at odd hours (2-3pm) if you're looking to sit in. Came in at a bit close to 2pm on a Thursday off and waited about 5mins after we ordered to be seated at a high table, but then were grateful we we seated at a more cozy table. 

My bf and I got the earl grey caramel soufflé pancakes to share and the Kyoto iced matcha latte for myself and the elderflower iced black tea for my bf. 

What I was pleased with:
The pancakes are worth the hype with them being super fluffy. The earl grey sauce was a nice match to eat with the pancakes and was not too overpowering. It tasted lovely with the berries adding a refreshing tartness as well. The drinks we got were also very refreshing.

Our server was nice in letting us know of an open table and swiftly moving us which we greatly appreciated. 

Prices in my opinion were fair. $14.99 for 3 big fluffy pancakes, berries and a smothered amount of earl grey sauce has me wanting to come back for a treat. Drinks are average priced to a coffee joint ($2.99-5.99 price range)

The interior decor sure makes one feel as if they aren't in Kensington. There's a classy flare to the place with it being clean and beautifully lit with natural lighting. 

The down fall: 
I didn't appreciate being rushed to order while waiting in line as we weren't even given a menu while in line, so once getting to the cashier and being asked \"what do you want?\"; was rather offputting as we thought we'd be seated prior to ordering but was told promptly, \"You have to order first!\" I mean... you're a cafe, not a burger joint! However, I'll give the cashier guy the benifit of the doubt that he was having a moody day."}
{"text":"The pancakes at this place are super fluffy and soft. I would highly recommend it! 

Love the decor too."}
{"text":"Soufflé me some more pancakes please! This is the first time I'm trying Japanese soufflé pancake and all I can say is that this is now my favourite dessert. These light and fluffy pancakes filled a void, and I'm not talking about my stomach. The void was for a dessert that I can have over and over again and not get sick of. The best way I can describe these pancakes is that they are the love child of chiffon cakes and custard delivered in pancake format. 

My only regret is not trying them with other sauces. I really liked the pancake and I liked the taro sauce individually, but the texture of the taro sauce did not complement the fluffy cakes as well as I would've hoped. 

The staff is very friendly and the store has a very relaxing feel. The price is a tiny bit on the steep side for pancakes, but worth it for the amount of happiness I felt while eating them. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Well, i heard a lot about this place. So I dropped by.
The 1st impression was they must've been just finished with a big crowd. Space was a little messy. I felt that there were too many staff there. I ordered a classic pancake and elderflower tea.
The pancake arrived 6 min later. It was not the best. It was a little runny. Attached you can see before and after image.  The pancakes need to be a little sweeter. And the elder flower drink was alright. It could have been made better.
I hope they can better themselves. I will Combe back to try again."}
{"text":"We arrived on Saturday 1:11pm and the cafe was busy! Even with the lineup and long wait times, the cafe is a nice place to meet for a delicious dining experience. The walls are lined with geometric artworks and lighting fixtures and the tables and seating are limited. The cafe gives off an airy and open ambience with lots of sunlight coming through the window and the many ceiling light fixtures.

We waited outside the cafe for 20 minutes the service was nice and informative - someone stepped outside to let us know fairly accurate wait time for table and soufflé. 
I would return to try the matcha soufflé pancakes or depending on timing any of their seasonal new menu items. According to their instagram posting they have a soft open promotion ending tomorrow April 8th - 20% off. 
After we placed our order and paid we waited for 60 minutes for the soufflé. 

We ordered a cup of Kyoto matcha latte ($4.99) and their seasonal flavour Earl Grey caramel sauce pancakes ($14.99). Both were good, we can taste the earl grey and the caramel (obviously it was too sweet, but it still tasted good).
An hour later, three light and fluffy soufflé pancakes topped with sliced strawberries, blueberries, swirl of whipped cream served with earl grey caramel sauce arrived to our table. The pancake was like a soft pillow and not too sweet. I like the soufflé on its own without the earl grey caramel sauce. Just a thought, it would had been nice to have the sauce on the side so it doesn't make the pancake soggy and deflate the height of the soufflé. 

Matcha latte was bold and strong even to the last drop. Subtle sweetness, frothy and smooth but, a bit bitter at the very bottom.

The price is fairly reasonable for an occasional splurge."}
{"text":"So we came here on a Sunday afternoon and it was pretty busy, we waited about less than an hour to get a table. The workers hand out water to people waiting in line which was nice of them. I ordered the custard pancake and my girlfriend ordered the taro purée pancakes. The pancakes are fluffy and wobbly, come with fresh fruit and a bit of cream. They were very soft textured which made them easy to eat. It was pretty good, I would come back again but on an off peak time."}
{"text":"It tastes terrible and you have to wait over 2 hours. Their operation, service, and layout are all poorly optimized. Even after you order it takes another 40min to wait for the pancakes. If the pancakes tasted decent, I would've at least accepted it as a consolation. Unfortunately, the pancakes were extremely mediocre and costed a pretty dollar. I found it hard to believe a place like this could survive their rent costs while hiring that amount of employees to essentially do nothing. Only one person was delegated to cook, while 3 other stood twiddling their thumbs. You'd think with that much unused space in their shop they'd at least give these employees some chairs to sit while they do nothing. 

As a side note, I am also disappointed that I cannot give a review of 0 stars on Yelp, because this place deserves 0 stars."}
{"text":"The food was okay but was overshadowed by the disorganized and chaotic service. I thoroughly enjoyed my Custard pancake. It had just the right amount of sweetness and the flavours all together (whipped cream, fruits and custard) made a good dessert. The Jasmine and Matcha were tasty as well. However, the matcha may be viewed as too strong for some people. The taro pancake was not as good since the syrup was lacking sweetness that pancakes usually have. We also tried the peach tea and elderflower iced tea. Both were great. Elderflower tasted a little like lychee.

PSA: Do not come here in a party with more than two people. 

The cafe is small with not a lot of seating. The priority is the ambience and aesthetic and because of this the space within the cafe is not utilized properly. There could be more space for tables and seating. However, all tables were organized for 2 people.

I was here around noon today, I thought for a weekday it wouldn't be busy but I was wrong. The line went out of the cafe. After finally getting a spot to wait inside, the manager was seating people. There was a group of 3 in front us.  It was very disorganized, the manager kept seating parties of 2 and prioritizing them. If you keep sitting two people at a time, you will never get an opportunity to sit a larger group. The manager asked the group ahead if they had a problem with them seating another table of 2 behind us, then asked us. I was annoyed at this time and expressed that it was unfair to prioritize groups of 2 when we had been already waiting for a long time. He apologized and said he would try to accommodate us as soon as possible, offering a discount for our inconvenience. 

The group of 3 were seated and two girls had to squish on the sofa as one spot, while the male had the chair at the other end. We were offered a small table of 2 with a bench and two chairs around it. He said that he would move us to a bigger table. There were multiple opportunities to move us to a bigger table by pushing the other tables together. However, he kept sitting tables of 2 and disregarded us. Our plates and drinks could not fit on the table and we had to keep our drinks on the floor. At one point the worker spilled our water passing by. 

I appreciate the gesture of the discount but it really wasn't needed. I ended up returning the discount as a tip. My complaint was the service and I thought it would've been extended when we were seated. However, it was as if we were forgotten about once we paid."}
{"text":"This place was worth the wait for me in a nice sunny day. Grabbed a coffee and then a snack while in line to eat here. It took about an hour. However, the cool part is that once you get closer to the front of the restaurant you can watch them making the pancakes. Realllly neat. 
I got the original which had with cream and berries on it. They were so fluffy and tender and not too sweet. When they first arrived I thought I should've shared with my friend but then after taking a bite I realize I could eat all three no problem. They are so light and airy"}
{"text":"Despite the bad weather(icy rain and wind) there was still a 30minute wait outside leading to another 10minutes wait. Seating is about 20-30 people capacity. They only have 3 heat plates which makes 6 on each so the food doesn't come out lightning quick. 

Opted for the matcha, jasmine and custard. All of them have the same base with a different type of sauce. The pancakes were very fluffy and airy with a light eggy taste. All the sauces were subtle. If I had to go back again, I'd opt for the custard option as it was the most pronounced of the 3. 

Great to go to satisfy ones curiosity, but don't think it's something I would be getting cravings for."}
{"text":"Kensington market's Hanabusa Cafe, is a cute new addition to the neighbourhood specializing in soufflé pancakes.

Their pancakes definitely live up to their name: they're deliciously light, airy, fluffy and almost fall apart in your mouth upon first forkful. They're also made to order, so your pancakes are almost guaranteed to be warm and fresh.

Initially I was disappointed that the pancakes themselves weren't matcha flavoured, but they honestly tasted so good I looked past it. The matcha sauce was a bit too bitter and strong for my taste so it'll probably be more suited for die-hard matcha fans.

Note: limited seating + demand = long wait times. Fortunately I came during what I think were off peak hours so there wasn't a wait, but if you come on a weekend or peak hours, be prepared for a long and slow-moving line."}
{"text":"They just opened and I do recommend to go and try for yourself! You be the judge; the plates are a nice size, if you're sharing like we did it and have coffee it's nice to relax. For one person, one plate is enough. Service was nice and wait time was good, peoples wait time was based on their first day so give em a break."}
{"text":"Exactly the same taste I used to have in Tokyo Japan. I tried taro and jasmine tea pancake. Soooo fluffy and the ingredients tastes very fresh. Especially the homemade taro sauce, which is the best taro sauce i had tried ever. Besides, the elderflower icedtea was awesome!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. If you like Uncle Tetsu and Japanese cheesecake you will love Hanabusa because their pancakes are even better!! If you come on the weekend be prepared to wait in line for awhile. The earlier you come the better. Their Souffle pancakes are so fluffy and tasty. My friends and I ordered 3 different types taro, creme brulee and earl grey. Out of the 3, I would say the creme brulee is my favorite but we still need to try their other flavours. 3 pancakes looks small enough for 1 person but trust me...they are very filling. Their matcha lattes are quite good too. One of the best things breakfast I had in Toronto by far. However, you have to love pancakes...they don't  have anything else in their menu."}
{"text":"Quite frankly, the wait didn't live up to the hype. Even if I had just come here on its own, the taste was comparable to the sponge cakes you get from Chinatown (but obviously, warm). That said, it's a really cute place? Just not really something that I'd come back to..."}
{"text":"Found Hanabusa Cafe through a Yelp search sitting at Burger's Priest so it was a quick walk to get there (located in Japantown). These pancakes were unlike any pancake I've ever had, they are soufflé pancakes and are so soft and fluffy. Since we had just had lunch, my boyfriend and I decided to share the Creme brûlée (with custard) and it was absolutely delicious. 

One con to the place is that it gets very packed (but I guess this is not their fault, they are just that good); however, they do a good job at letting you know that unless you're taking to-go, you will need to wait and they get you seated in order as soon as possible. 

The other con was the water. They do not sell bottled water, only coffees, teas, etc. They do offer tap water though so if you don't want tap, you should bring your own. 

If I'm ever in Toronto again, I would definitely return to Hanabusa!!"}
{"text":"There was a line but the line was moving pretty fast. Their pancakes are really good but there is no space to seat so we just grabbed our food and left."}
{"text":"Very yummy! I came here because I couldn't resist the jiggle, you know what I'm talking about - those enticing blogTO videos showing off the fluffiness that is Japanese soufflé pancakes 

Dropped by on a Thursday afternoon for a table for one to avoid peak hours and the associated wait time, the staff recommended her favourite, lemon curd pancakes, which happens to be a summer special. Total came out to about 17 dollars after tax and I sat at the bar tables to patiently await my pancakes as I bask in the sweet aroma that fills the cafe. 

I ate the entire dish in 8 minutes, then had a sugar high for the next 2 hours. I'm not a huge fan of sweets and hate things that are overly sweet, I found the combination of lemon curd and pancakes to be a perfect level of sweetness, therefore I abandoned the jar of honey that came with my dish. I think this is the perfect dish to share if you don't have a huge sweet tooth! But definitely worth a try and I will be back!"}
{"text":"Im very satisfied with their food n sercices. Now i understand why fast food are so popular in North America...At Bill's (FYI a famous Japanese souffle pancake restaurant), it took me 2 hrs to get seated n 1 hr for food. The waiting time at hanabusa was pretty reasonable for me...But here ppl are complaing about the waiting time and not considering the food itself. How the food is made and the quality...it takes time to make a single fluffy pancake...i would say, if u wanna finish ur food within a hr (included waiting time), McDonald does a good job and please go there and get a North American style pancake..."}
{"text":"The line was kind of ridiculous. The pancakes were good but not fluffy enough and the price is pretty expensive considering it's just pancakes. Seating was crazy it was just not very organized it felt like fast food where you order up front then get a seat but people were just sitting down before ordering but what was nice was a worker kicked those people out since they didn't order yet. The whole system just seemed very disorganized and slow, classic Japanese. Came once but probs won't come again."}
{"text":"For the trend followers, waiting like an \"idiot\" in a long line outside a place might seem like a \"cool\" thing.  But honestly, give me a break!!!!  Management is as stupid as it comes with this type of practice, playing hard to get nonsense.  The long line is a \"deliberate\" act, staged by deliberate management to create that Buzz some folks crave (dumb idiots).  If only they had plan on adding 2 ADDITIONAL cooking areas staffed by 1 or 2 more pancake cooks, the lines would be gone in no time.  There, it's that simple and silly.  My advice, for those who make good living, don't bother waiting until management shape up and add more capacity to increase volume and speed.  Silly pancakes are not worth that kind of time and money.  For those willing to stand outside in the cold frigid weather in Toronto for a pancake, more power to you."}
{"text":"I really did not expect much coming here, but was pleasantly surprised when I tried the taro pancakes - super pillowy, fluffy and not too sweet. The dreamiest pancakes I've tried!"}
{"text":"it is my favourite pancake. it tastes soft, tender,sweety.My friends like it and we will come back soon."}
{"text":"On my occasional food tour in Kensington and I was drawn into this new cafe selling soufflé pancakes! It's their first day of opening, and it was like watching a real-life game of Overcooked where the kitchen is about to burn down as everyone fails to logistically coordinate. ~6 people working and they can't deliver about 10-15 orders in a timely matter (more than 45mins). There were about 6 tables + a few waiting. 

BUT their recipe is actually surprisingly good! I did enjoy the fluffiness and eggy flavour of their soufflé pancake. We ordered the matcha soufflé for $14.99. It reminds me of uncle Tetsu but fluffier and pillowy, quite unique. I say worth a try if you have time to spare and are able to get a seat without waiting too long. When I ordered soufflé at other places, they always mentioned that it would take 30mins. So same here, it's made to order.

I'm not sure how this café would be able to execute their concept quickly. Their recipe would call for making fresh batter incrementally (to keep it fluffy) causing a serious bottleneck when scaling. 

To note, there is a major lack of leadership and a sense of urgency in the kitchen and owners weren't able to foresee operational issues. No one seems to be leading. 

We told the owner, we will back in 30 mins and instead of us sitting and waiting. He agreed, yet he kind of forgot our order and table and had to prioritize our order when we came back. The owner seems kinda dazed or confused but he managed to pull through but he can't seem to articulate well to offer better customer service. We didn't get our table back at the end and had to stand near a counter to eat. I mean the owner is trying I saw him offer refunds and didn't charge some groups in front of us because of the long wait times. 

I won't burn them like the first reviewer since it's their first day! It's hard to start a new business and her review is basically trying to send a new restaurant to the grave. I think it's understandable, the pancakes were pretty good, and I liked the decor and cutlery they used."}
{"text":"If you would like to try soufflé pancake, this on will be a good option but high chance that you need to line up during weekend. Food overall is good. Recommend Taro, custard and original pancake(order does matter). If you wanna try the one with egg and bacon, you need to come before 2pm. I would go again for the taro pancake and give a try for the egg and bacon one."}
{"text":"We went today during the Kensington festival. They told us it would be a 40 minute wait for our food and we agreed as we'd explore and come back. I told them I wanted to sit there but they packed it up so our sauce and cream was all melted. The spongy texture is unique and quite good, service not so much."}
{"text":"5 stars for the pancake, 3 for the service. 
We split the Earl Grey pancake between 3 people for a snack. The pancake itself is super fluffy and buttery and not too sweet. It was topped with the Earl Grey caramel and whipped cream - and it was soo good. It's a little pricey for $16 but it was big enough to share. 

Service was a little confusing. When we came to the counter to order, we were told there were no tables but they also didn't know how long the wait was. When we were seated, they seated the 3 of us at a 2 people booth"}
{"text":"After several failed attempts of coming here due to long line-ups (they don't take reservations!). I finally came on a sunny Saturday morning at 10:45am to make sure we got a spot right as they opened at 11am. Sure enough we did !

Now that I've been here a couple times, I've tried ALMOST all their pancakes. Each are very true to their flavours and the stack of 3 pancakes are fluffy and jiggly. Don't be fooled though, one plate per person left us completely full! 

CUSTARD SOUFFLÉ (5/5) - my favourite since I love anything with custard. It was just sweet enough and the custard was thick and wonderfully done. The torched sugar on top was an awesome touch.
KYOTO MATCHA SOUFFLÉ (5/5) - the vibrantly green Matcha that you pour onto your pancakes was plentiful and legit. The fresh fruits and whipped cream did balance out the earthy and slight bitterness of the matcha. 
TARO SOUFFLÉ (5/5) - the purée truly tastes like real taro and wasn't too sweet!
CARAMEL EARL GRAY SOUFFLÉ (4/5) - love the flavourful Earl Gray component of the sauce but I found the caramel made it super sweet. 
JUNE SEASONAL HONEY LEMON (3.5/5) - the lemon curd is very tart and compliments the soufflé and the sweet drizzled honey. 

Definitely worth coming back for my favourites and to try some of their new seasonal flavours!"}
{"text":"After seeing all the pictures of Japanese soufflé pancakes all over Instagram, I finally made my way to the grand opening at Hanabusa Cafe and it did not disappoint.

The pancakes themselves are spectacular: extremely light and fluffy with a soufflé-like texture and just a touch of delicious creaminess on the inside. All dishes are made fresh to order and you can watch the entire process unfold in front of you from the open concept kitchen. The batter is freshly whipped up, cooked on a covered griddle, and then topped up with even more batter and cooked for two more minutes in order to achieve that impressive height we love in our soufflés. Once the pancakes are a perfect golden brown on both sides, they're topped with a variety of toppings to make up the different types of pancake dishes.

I had the opportunity to try three different types of soufflé pancakes. The Custard Pancake ($13.99) is covered with a thick layer of custard and then topped with a caramel sauce which is brûléed to perfection and paired with strawberries, blueberries and whipping cream. A great choice - creamy and delicious.

The Matcha Pancake ($14.99) was my favourite and is topped with a premium Kyoto matcha sauce, sweet azuki bean, strawberries, blueberries, whipping cream and caramel syrup. I really liked that the matcha had a deep grassy tea flavour as opposed to the more milky ones we typically find in North America. The sweetness of the azuki bean paired really well with the more earthy flavour of the matcha.

The Taro Pancake ($13.99) is topped with house-made taro purée, taro chips and whipping cream. I found this one just ok as the purée was made with real taro and was a bit more mild in flavour. However it world be a good option for those who like things less sweet.

The Elderflower Iced Tea ($5.49) is a good complement to the pancakes with a refreshing mix of elderflower green tea and gingerale, it tasted a bit of lychee.

The store itself is spacious and quite Instagramable and there are about 9 small tables in the back seating area. However, given the amount of time it takes to prepare the pancakes, it makes sense not to seat more than 20 people at a time. It takes about 10-15 minutes to make up a batch of pancakes (2 plates per batch) and so if several tables sat down all at the same time, I could see there being a bit of a wait. So if you're looking or a quick dessert, this might not be the place to be."}
{"text":"There is plenty of choice, it's easy to order, but pancakes are pricey ($17). I got free water while waiting for my pancakes (10min wait). Good service and atmosphere. 

The pancakes were good, fluffy, not too sweet, not too much matcha. This is not as filling as normal pancakes, it's actually lighter, kind of eggy. It's worth trying and I would recommend the classic matcha ones!"}
{"text":"This place is good, but more of a Try It Once If You Haven't kind of spot. I came here with one of my best friends and I'll probably bring Superwoman here, but I don't see myself craving these and returning any time soon, even though it was tasty and well done.

We'd planned to come here right when they opened or maybe 15 minutes before, but we had too much fun the night before hanging out, chatting into the wee hours, so we didn't manage to wake up early enough. We got there at about 11:45am? 11:50am? and waited quite a long time - I'd guess about 40 minutes, but I'm not sure. 

*Tip: (If you don't come before they open) Come with at least 1 friend and have one person line up while the other person buys tacos over at Seven Lives, so you can eat something delicious and savoury while you wait.

Verdict:  The pancakes were delicious. They were better than the souffle pancakes I had in Osaka. They were super fluffy and visually extremely appealing. They make them a little sweeter so that you don't need any kind of syrup, though if you order one of the flavoured ones, the sauces are sweet and can be a bit much. They also clearly use great ingredients - I could taste the fresh eggs and butter and high quality vanilla in the pancakes, and the whipped cream was real, fresh whipped cream. Delicious. But they basically taste like a souffle - almost exactly the same. So if you're a souffle enthusiast, you'll be in heaven. But if you're like me, and you like them but you don't go crazy for them, you probably won't go crazy for these pancakes either.

I was very impressed that they don't rush you, given the lineup they have, but perhaps they should, because waiting in line really sucks, and because some people will be inconsiderate and chat for a long time after they've eaten. They also decorated the space beautifully, but they could totally, totally fit at least 1 or 2 more tables in there, which would help at least a little bit.

Another problem is that it takes a while for them to make these things, because it seems like a labour-intensive kind of dish. You can't really pre-whip the eggs because they will deflate - so you have to wait a long time to even get inside, then you have to wait for them to make your order. It wasn't too heinously long a wait, but it could be because I went with a friend and we were able to chat the whole time.

So all in all, the product is great, though it's not my favourite kind of food, so I wouldn't wait hours - but I'd bring anyone I care about to try it if they haven't yet."}
{"text":"$12 for 3 fluffy pancakes. Extremely good!!! This will taste better than you expect - it's like biting into a lightly sweetened cloud. Comes with a cold whipped cream that nicely contrasts the warm pancakes and some fresh berries. Would 100% recommend to everyone except for those in a rush - we waited half an hour for a meal that took literally 3 minutes to eat. Definitely a must try though."}
