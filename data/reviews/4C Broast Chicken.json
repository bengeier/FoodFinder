{"text":"Ended up here by accident. Was lured by the 3.29$ daily special for 2 pc chicken, spicy fries and a drink. Chicken was crispy, moist, and delicious. Good value for the money. I love that it's directly adjacent to a kfc."}
{"text":"This is a hole in a wall chicken joint. Love their spicy chicken and love their prices. I am not ordering from Popeyes or KFC or Mary Brown anymore. Line up on a Sunday is crazy!!! The eating area.. Not to be desire for. Just go for take out!!!
Visit their website for info. Tasted their chicken wings on my friend's baby shower. Now I am hooked."}
{"text":"One would have to think your nuts to not only open a chicken place in the same plaza, as a KFC, but to open one right next door, your gonna have to do something different. Well they are, Halal style, Everything from pieces of chicken to wings, tenders, sandwiches, All Day Breakfast."}
{"text":"Good fresh chicken, good price. We took advantage of their everyday deal, which is $3.29 for leg & thigh, fries, and a coke. This is a very good deal, and I was pleased to find out we actually got 1 thigh and one big chicken breast piece when we went.

Over-all, definitely worth checking out, due to the quality of their food and really cheap price."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of 4C. Been going there often since July 2014 when I first found out about it.

(prices listed are accurate as of January 2016)

Notes:
- They have a website with the menu including prices (and it's the current menu, not outdated)
- Good location (at a major intersection)
- Good hours (open quite late for the area) and open 7 days a week
- They offer delivery (min $25) but I've never utilized it
- Accepts cash, debit, credit
- Halal, if you care about that
- Lots of options: chicken, wraps, burgers, sandwiches, fries, ice cream, smoothies, sundaes, milkshakes, coffee, slush drinks, poutine, coleslaw, etc.

I can't comment on the prices for every single thing, but their \"Toony Loony\" everyday special is a fantastic deal. It's what I get like 90% of the time. $3.29 gets you 1 leg, 1 thigh, a side of fries, and a 16oz fountain drink that you can refill yourself. That's $3.45 with tax and that price has remained since they opened.

They will ask you spicy or mild. I choose spicy but both are good. Their spicy fries are quite tasty. I wouldn't call them spicy at all, but more just \"seasoned\". Same with the chicken.

Speaking of that chicken -- it's always tasty, cooked properly, and well seasoned. Definitely no issues there, especially at that price. I definitely feel like I am getting my monies worth. Also, you can add extra fries to that deal for $1 more (which I often do lol)

If you order just that deal, you'll usually have it within 2 or 3 minutes. It's been super slow a few times, but that's rare.

Make note that you can also substitute the leg/thigh for a breast, for $1.75 more per piece - which is not just a good price, but the chicken breasts they have there are HUGE! (if you do this substitution, it'll take 15 minutes, so maybe call ahead). I make this substitution every few visits and it's super worth it.

Other things to note:
- They have 3 walk-in specials ($2.29 each) which are 6 nuggets, or 4 wings, or 1 chicken wrap. I've tried all 3 at least once. I recommend their nuggets and wrap, bit didn't think the wings were that good

- Their coleslaw is fine, but nothing special ($2.29). I'd say the same about their poutine ($3.99)

- Some of their dipping sauces really help kick it up a notch ($0.25/each). Their honey garlic and creamy garlic are my faves... they also have hot sauce, plum, sweet and sour, and barbecue.

- They now have a 2nd location (1093 O'Connor) which has the same menu + donuts, bagels, muffins, etc (I havent been there)

Conclusion:
Give 4C Broaster a try! You'll probably like it. I know I do :)

(P.S. During the school year, avoid going between 11:30 and 12:15 Mon-to-Fri because there's a school around the corner, and the place will be PACKED with students. You'll probably be waiting 20 min just to place your order.)"}
{"text":"We ordered 40 pieces of chicken for Friday night. Delivery. Chicken was crisp and tender and delicious. $10.99 for 10 pieces. Delivery was free because my order was over $25. Upon delivery, I realized they forgot to bring me sauces. The delivery person actually volunteered to go back to the store, pick up the sauces, and bring them back to me. That was nice."}
{"text":"It says 4C Broast Chicken but they have much more going on than just Fried Chicken: breakfast sandwiches served all day, baked goods, coffee and blended drinks.

Pretty busy place with lots of regulars hanging out. The place is clean with many tables and big windows to watch the world go by.

It doesn't look like the staff enjoy working there by the lack of warmth and smiles (Sunday early afternoon crew). 

Ordered the following: 4 piece chicken combo with spicy fries (pretty mild) and a small pop, a side of onion rings and an iced cappuccino (it was a blended drink).

Cooked to order so they were piping hot and crunchy. The breast was on the dry side but the wing, thigh and leg were juicy. Fries were dusted and fried so they were tasty and crunchy but not spicy at all. Onion rings were crunchy but meh. Iced cappuccino was tiny and tasted terrible. 

Overall everything was too oily and the only reason we'd return is if hubby has a greasy fried chicken craving."}
{"text":"This place is kind of a hole in the wall. But the chicken here is legit off the HOOK! It's \"broasted\" (I actually thought I read the sign wrong at first) which is where the chicken is fried in a pressure cooker. It's supposed to be a bit dangerous to do and needs special equipment. What is the result of all of this work is crispy skin and mouth wateringly moist chicken meat. I actually hate chicken with a passion and had to be dragged here by my fiance. I'm really glad we did because this made me enjoy chicken again for the first time in years!! 

What's really great about this place is that they have a ton of specials on buckets and really reasonable prices on milkshakes and other yummy drinks. The customer service was also extremely personable and warm. The only reason I'm taking a star off is because the area is a bit sketchy and run down, so this would be the perfect place for take out."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a cheap snack of chicken, then go here. Ask for the special on the poster in the window. 2 pieces of chicken (dark) with fries and fountain pop for around $4.00, and you can refill the pop. The meal is cooked while you wait so it's fresh and hot  and good. They have other stuff here but I can only tell you about the chicken. Lunch time during the week it's full of kids so you may want to avoid going there at that time."}
{"text":"4C is a fried chicken spot located right by this vintage looking KFC. Bit of an odd location as it's taking KFC head on it appears. The place itself looks like a small run down place, but the food here and the prices are pretty good.

I got a 2 piece chicken meal with fries and a coke for only $3.49. It was a walk-in special. The chicken was pretty good. The skin was crisp and the taste is similar to that of Popeye's. The fries were also good as they are the skinny crisp ones. Much more similar to Popeyes than KFC so use that as your reference point. You can have the chicken spicy or mild as well. 

They have specials everyday and some walk in specials as well. The place is good for takeout and for a quick meal as I believe they have most things prepped and ready to go."}
{"text":"Daily specials:

5 legs/things chicken:  $10.99;
1 leg/thigh + fries + drink:  $3.29;
4 chicken wings:  $2.29

4C Broaster chicken next to KFC!
Done FRESH while you wait.

Sundae at $0.99 all summer long."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. The prices are great and the chicken is great as well. I've tried the burger, which was okay. I can't say the same for the chicken philly steak sandwich (although some would argue that I deserved to be disappointed for ordering a chicken philly steak over a beef. Sorry - I like chicken). 

Although I wouldn't go out of my way for this place, it is a good place to get some halal fried chicken! 

Also, the service is amazing - both times I was served with a pleasant smile, even though it was pretty busy."}
{"text":"I had, first time I went was awesome, really high hopes for this place, after that chicken has been extremely dry and now the owner or whoever cooking is giving next to no fries with meal, pretty sad when a four piece meal gave everyone about 8-10 fires each with a piece of chicken. I went back 3 times and it only got worse...two ppl infront of me complained about the portion sizes as well....too bad, guess I go back to swiss chalet across the road!"}
{"text":"We always order their walk in special (4 pcs wings). Always fresh and crispy. Its never oily. Even after reheating the left overs, it still taste good. I usually call ahead for take outs since it can get busy... definitely my go to for wings if I crave some."}
{"text":"Accidentally called this branch for take out instead of the one in Victoria Park. Place is cleaner than Victoria park and food is as good. 4c is my go to fried chicken. Everyday special leg and thigh is 11.99 an awesome deal.
Same leg and thigh would cost you $16 or more in Popeyes and kfc. Their chicken wing tray is a bomb."}
