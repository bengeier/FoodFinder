{"text":"Giant sports bar with huge screen tv in the back and then tv screens at each booth. Modern decor.   We've been here twice now and have had the Adam's burger, Philly Cheesesteak, Montreal Poutine and sides of perogies and plain fries.  The burger is so dang juicy AND comes with an egg. Its got this house sauce (reminds me of teriyaki sauce?) Whatever it was, it made that burger heavenly. Philly cheesesteak was tender and yum. Perogies filled with potatoes and came with sour cream. It was tasty but in my opinion, the side of fries was better :p The poutine gravy was delicious and had a generous serving of cheese curds that were soft and gooey near the end. Mmmmmm.  They also have Murphy's on tap- a beer from Ireland but with notes of a coffee taste. Very smooth.   Can't wait to come back!!!"}
{"text":"Passed by a few times and wanted to get a try. Actually, there are a few restaurants at the very same area that I wanted to give it a try. Stepped inside and the restaurant is nicely decorated. I feel comfortable and relaxed. I am the only customer in the restaurant.   Ordered an Adams burger and I upgraded the side to a poutine. The burger is nicely decorated with two toothpicks with a soccer ball on one end to associate with the world cup happening right now. The sauce inside the burger seized my attention at my first bite cos the sauce is spicy and sweet. Other than that, this is a multilayered burger. It has lettuce, slices of tomato, a burger patty, a fried egg and onion etc. inside the sandwich. The sauce is interesting. For the poutine, the gravy tastes a bit salty.   One of the waitresses changed the channel on the tv and so the tv at my booth no longer playing  any sports program. Yet the waitress came to my table several times and was not sensitive enough to see the tv has nothing on but a s blue screen. Sigh! No parking for this restaurant. Another point deducted."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good. I had the burger with salad and my friend had a veggie burger with fries.    Staff were friendly and the place had a good vibe.  We would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I passed by this location a few times. There are at least two restaurants at this complex that I wanted to give it a try. Felt like having burger tonight and so I picked Adams out of the two. There's a little patio area outside the restaurant. As I walked into the restaurant, the tone colour of the restaurant is on the dark side, with the elegant interior design of the restaurant, it gave me an impression that I was about to dine in a high class restaurant. I chose to sit inside at a booth with a tv. I didn't choose to sit outside because the sun is gone. There's an individual tv at each booth.   The menu is just a two sided plastic pledge. All food items and beverages are all on the rectangular plastic pledge. I ordered a glass of Rickards's Red and an Adams burger and had upgraded the side order to a poutine.  The beer arrived first and it was refreshing. Made me felt relaxing and quenched my thirst. Shortly after, the burger came and it was cut in two halves. Looking at the burger in halves, it had multiple layers stacked with slices cucumber, tomato slices, a fried egg, something crunch but I could not figure out what it was, a burger patty, lettuce and onion etc. At my first bite, it was the sauce caught my attention. The sauce was interesting. It tasted spicy, then at the second bite, it was sweet. Then the patty caught my taste bud. As the burger was in multilayers, so as the taste experience.   For the poutine, the cheese cubes were melting in the gravy. Very Nice!! Just that the gravy was a bit salty to my taste.   Amazingly, I was the only customer in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Delicious wings great service. 5$ a lb on Wednesdays! Highly recommended that you try the Adams house sauce on the wings, really unique and delicious!"}
{"text":"Neely renovated space that would be great for watching a game with friends - there are individual TVs at each booth / table so you can choose what you want to watch. The space is big too with plenty of tables and a bar. I got the sliders and they were so delicious. They had a sweet taste to them - similar to the delicious Japaburgers at Nom√© Izakaya (which is coincidentally close by). My friend got the classic burger and said it was good, but he was especially impressed by the fries (they were really good- I sampled some!) The service was super friendly and attentive, but keep in mind it was quiet when we went at an odd time on a weekday. The server went out of his way to share coupons and game day specials they had like half priced wings on Leafs playoff game days. They also served us a tasty complimentary dessert - like a giant timbit with chocolate sauce and a strawberry which was a nice touch. Overall would definitely come back for both the food and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Adams Burger Bar perfectly encapsulates a place that's \"ok\" - not a must-go place but also not avoid-at-all-costs either. Before I get to my thoughts, I'll clarify by saying I went here during lunchtime, so I didn't have the benefit (bias?) of a loud and lively sports bar. So just basing it strictly on the food, Adams is an ok place to go to for a decent (though a bit overpriced) meal. I had: - Adams beef sliders: A bit on the sweet side, which may seem weird but actually tasted good. Number (3) and size (hold-in-1-hand) were typical for sliders, though for $15 I guess I was expecting a bit more. (On that note, a group of 6 sat down when I was there and then decided to leave before ordering. I overheard one of them complain about the $19 tag for the Adams burger. Didn't get it so can't comment on whether the full burger is worth that much.) - Fried perogies with sour creme and caramelized onions: Not a fan. Usually perogies are filled with something (potato, cheese), and maybe this one was, but all I could taste was the dough. Also the caramelized onions didn't really have a lot of flavour and were more like a visual garnish than something that actually enhanced the dish. - Donut dessert: Kudos to Adams for giving me a complimentary dessert. It was a straightforward mini donut which was fine - nothing amazingly different from other donuts, but not bad either.  This specific location has had its fair share of restaurant/bar turnover. I'd be interested to see if I'm more of the outlier versus all the positive reviews so far, and Adams Burger Bar sticks around."}
{"text":"Honestly the space is large and nice with lots of tvs including individual booth tvs! But the servers seemed to not know the menu, or what beers they had on tap. Also the food is waaaaay overpriced. They would do better knocking a couple bucks off each menu item. Shame cause would be a nice place to watch games, but I rather save my coin and go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday afternoon & we were the only customers in the restaurant. The decor is nice & everything looks new. However I thought the food was a little over priced. I got the sliders with fries & hubby had the poutine. The burger in the sliders looked to be made in-house. But the meat was really thin & slathered in bbq sauce which I didn't like the taste of too much. My fries were over salted. Our wait staff service was very relaxed since we were the only customers in a 2 hours span.   I did like the thick napkins they had & the TVs at every booth. This place might be good to watch sports games as they also have a large screen on the back wall. But I'm kind of iffy on the food. I'm not sure if I would come back here to give them another chance. I'll think about it."}
{"text":"Watched the first Raptors Playoff game there on Saturday! Many screens, good atmosphere and the Burger Sliders are simply delirious! Everybody enjoyed their drinks as well! Awesome Place! I'll come back very soon!"}
