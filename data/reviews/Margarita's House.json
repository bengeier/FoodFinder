{"text":"First time there: service was very slow, food was flavorful - but cold. Tacos, beans, rice: all cold. But it took so long to arrive at our table that we just sucked it up and ate it any way. I really hate to leave a negative review, but I really love Mexican food and this was a letdown."}
{"text":"Well, I really wanted to go here, but not so much anymore. 

These guys dish out possibly the worst customer service I have encountered for a restaurant within Calgary and I haven't even dined here!
 
My friend and I were going to celebrate our birthdays as a surprise from our group of friends, so we had no idea our friends would be there. But when we turned up outside the restaurant, it was closed! Whats interesting is we received no warning, or cancellation from the restaurant - nothing! Turns out the surprise for the birthday dinner was ruined and we had to search for quite some time to dine somewhere else that could cater and sit our large group.
We also noticed that many other disgruntled guests who also made reservations were left high and dry.

I called the restaurant to complain, and they didn't seem to care the slightest about our experience - all I received from the employee on the line was \"we're sorry for the inconvenience, we are in a transition because we are moving\" 

If I were the manager of this restaurant and I caused this to unsuspecting diners I would be offering a free dining experience or more."}
{"text":"Just the best Margaritas! Server so friendly and good service! We enjoyed Friday nite, with good drinks and good companion!"}
{"text":"I have gone to this place for a few lunches now, and have enjoyed the food every time. The food is great tasting and authentic, prices are reasonable, and service is good. I've had the fish tacos, regular tacos (3 choices of fillings - I had chicken), and the burrito (multiple choices again - I had advocado chicken), and have thoroughly enjoyed them all. Prices in order were $10 for 3, $15 for 3, and $15 for a massive burrito. I'll take pictures of the menu next time through.

It's a tight place with about a half-dozen tables and a small area outside for when weather is nice. Lots of people order take-out for lunch too."}
{"text":"Prices are reasonable. Good was good. Very laid back atmosphere. Margaritas were awesome. Would go back again for sure. The service was good once our orders were taken. Lots of variety on the menu. Parking is tough to find but that isn't the restaurants fault."}
{"text":"Delicious, casual, friendly, comfortable and authentic. We stumbled into this place because it is near our hotel, and it is EASILY the best food I've eaten since we arrived in Calgary a couple of days ago. We shared a ceviche (so good and a generous portion especially for the price) the four salsas and an order of guacamole. We also ordered three tacos each so we actually had entirely too much food, but we wanted to try everything. The only downside - if I can even call it that, is that each if those orders came with their own supply of tortilla chips for scooping so we had way more than we needed.  The tacos were amazing, my favourite (to my surprise) was the humble pork taco. It looked the least exciting on the plate but the quality of the pork and the simple but authentic seasoning was amazing. I also had the chicken tinga (saucy and flavourful) and the chorizo with potato (savoury and filling). They have a fab drinks menu too, lots if lovely and unexpected ways to drink tequila and great selection of Mexican beers. I had the Michelada - beer, line, salt, ice. The perfect balance for a hot day.  I'm so glad we found this place - I hope we can squeeze in another visit while we're here!"}
{"text":"Best AUTHENTIC Mexican food in the city. Including ginger ale in bottles made with real ginger and cane sugar. This is becoming a regular shop for us. Also like the (albeit small) patio, which is great on a warm summer evening. Great neighborhood for people watching too."}
{"text":"Being from California where Mexican food is considered \"local fare\", I was really excited to try Mexican food in Calgary.  Unfortunately, this place did not represent well.  The service was slow and the food was very expensive for what you get.  I am not used to paying for chips and salsa at a dine in restaurant, so that was a bit of a put off.  And it took almost 15 minutes to get them after we ordered.  The chicken mole taco was great, the chicken tinga taco was good and the carnitas taco was way too fatty for my taste.  The hubby enjoyed his veggie quesadilla meal with beans and rice on the side.  
All that being said, the people were very nice and the drinks were delicious!  We got a free pina colada shot on the way out and I have to say that it was the best pina colada I've ever tasted!  This shot alone bumped my review up 1.5 stars!  Thinking back, I did notice that every other table had really big, tasty looking drinks on them. 
In summary, if you are really looking for a place that makes great drinks and serves Mexican food on the side, this place may work for you.  If you do decide to eat here, definitely try the chicken mole tacos."}
{"text":"I recommend this to everyone I see. The tacos are amazing the margaritas are delicious."}
{"text":"I had a draft piece that was not complimentary, but it doesn't matter. This place has shut down. It is too bad as the place started out very promising, but ingredients, staffing, and service all declined in very short order."}
{"text":"Great food.  Tacos are wonderful.  Service is prompt and friendly.  I had some issues with the air quality inside; because of my asthma I was pretty done after an hour sitting inside.  However on the plus side, they have a nice seating space outside for a few tables.  I would sit outside next time.  And there will be a next time for sure!"}
