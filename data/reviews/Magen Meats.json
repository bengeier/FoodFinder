{"text":"Fellas, I just got back from that place... it was a truly exceptional experience. If you miss the butcher shop of old mixed with the newest technology, stop by this place.

They have a great selection of all the finest cuts of meat and chicken in a clean and fresh setting. Its truly one of a kind for Toronto. 

Check it out yourself, you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Very happy with the CC door. Their daily meals are so delicious and I'm very impressed with them. Their Lamberger's are amazing and they made of your brisket for me which was delicious"}
{"text":"Natural Local Farm Meat to your table. 
The Magen way is to source farm to table and make it Kosher for Toronto and York Region. 

I was extremely surprised today when I made a visit to this butcher in Thornhill. The meat is vacuum packed and they do custom orders. 

I had some fresh Premium Rib Eye Steaks cut for me. 

Pricing for organic or grass fed is almost the same as regular beef. So can you say SCORE. 

For those that are looking for a source of fresh.  Beef you have to check them out. 

They also have marinated packages of beef and chicken already to go on the BBQ. 

Looking forward to the spring when they will be bringing in fresh local Lamb and Chicken all organically raised. 

Talk about taking the 100 mile challenge of here you go."}
