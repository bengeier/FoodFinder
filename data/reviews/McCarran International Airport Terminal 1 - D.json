{"text":"Very poor and in adequate signage to direct people to the rental car location via shuttlebus several of the folks on our bus as well as ourselves at difficulty finding the location they can do a much better job if they choose"}
{"text":"TSA staff friendly and helpful when approached with questions. Explained what was happening with the alarm system. Presented clear and precise directions."}
{"text":"Sandra olson in pickup was just plain out of line. She started her conversation by yelling at me. I'm a adult here lower ur voice 5 levels so I can understand what ur problem is. She definitely needs customer service classes. I dont respond well to a person yelling at me because they dont like the way I am walking. Talk to me like you have some sense and we will get somewhere."}
{"text":"I like this airport and remember back when it was much smaller, how the times change. Of course it is huge now much like other major hubs. And I do enjoy visiting Las Vegas. Especially I enjoy the year round weather there."}
{"text":"Not a lot to say except small airport, and is clean, and well maintenanced. Most staff was informed and helpful but we did run into a couple that were oblivious to what was going on and we had to ask more than one person the same question. 
Lockers are available free of charge to leave your belongings and bathrooms are clean and well maintained."}
{"text":"Love this hidden Starbucks location. Nestled in the corner of the D gates by 22 and 21 is a hidden Starbucks! The only reason I saw it was I ended up seeing a logo sign popping out of the wall. Otherwise you could blink and miss it.

So this location has something I haven't seen at any of my local starbucks in Las vegas... a Zombie Frapachino. As soon as I saw the sign I had to try it. 

It seemed like my barista had never tried it before because she had to reference the barista making drinks to ask what it tasted like. Carmel apple I was told, sold!

Once it arrived it looked really cool, but slightly different than the creative image thwy have as advertising lol. None the less it does taste lile a Carmel apple and I love it!!"}
{"text":"Quick airport to get in and out of. Never much of a line. 3 terminals. I've always ran into helpful staff here. Plenty places to eat and drink. There's even a lot machines throughout the airport, which is cool and unique to any other airport."}
{"text":"Nothing here is gluten free and shouldn't every restaurant or food vendor have gluten free now. It's 2018 now and how are people with allergies supposed to eat?"}
{"text":"I like this airport just for the simple fact that there are slot machines all over the place and it gives you classic Vegas as soon as you get off of the plane. I've been multiple times to this airport and it never gets old. Good selection of restaurants too."}
{"text":"Fairly decent airport. My Uber dropped me off in front. They have one security check point which is a mess. The TSA staff here didn't care to move fast or try to be efficient. In many other airports I fly out of, security has gotten much better throughout the years. Once through security you have to walk to your gate area or take a tram. Free WiFi that works some of the time depending where you are. 

Post security there are many food, drink, bars, and coffee shop options. I was able to find a decent breakfast for under $10 or for $15 I got a full breakfast. 

Cons: The Uber pick up experience is terrible. Unlike many other airports you don't get your Uber from the arrival (drop off area). There are also no signs when you land telling you where to Uber pick up area is. Only when I asked did they tell me that I had to take a tram. Then snake my way around to a parking garage, then go to the 5th floor to see the Uber pick up area. 

Limited charging by the gate area."}
{"text":"I had a shoulder massage with Hope, and it was the best decision I made all weekend. Hope gave me the refresh I needed after a few days of late nights and early mornings. 
I had my chair massage in Terminal C.  If you're in the airport with time to spare, this is the cheapest and most worthwhile thing you can do for yourself."}
{"text":"One of my favorite airports because it offers so many food options, decent wifi, tons of shops. The place is huge and terminal 1 to terminal 3 is not walking distance. Just an fyi"}
{"text":"Really loud, I mean loud !!!! announcements,  keep repeating over and over !!  So stupid !  Not really a world class airport, nor is D gates user friendly."}
{"text":"Very simple to find my way around and to my gate with all the signs they have. I love that there's plentiful of food restaurants and restrooms around, also super clean! Decent WiFi and well organized with the taxis outsized. The only thing I struggled was find where uber and lyfts pick you up, that could've been on my part since i wasn't looking at signs.  I didn't have any major trouble with this airport and perhaps I will be returning to Las Vegas in the future!"}
{"text":"My only complaint about this airport is the tsa staff are rude and not very patient.  Granted it was 5 in the morning when we were there, but there was no reason to snap at people and roll eyes.  Definitely on a power trip.  We overhead numerous people on the tram to the gate that they've never seen such rude staff before.  Other then that, the airport is fine.  Flight was on time and the airport is easy to get around.  At least I'm prepared for next time.  I'll remember it's ok to be a bitch at the airport because it'll help me fit right in."}
{"text":"This is a very clean airport & easy to navigate around. Once you step into the airport, you can gamble right  there on slot machines & other games which makes you feel like you're already on the Las Vegas strip! Also a variety of restaurants."}
{"text":"As you come out of the airport terminal 1 D, you'll see a couple rows of slot machines then heading back to the check in area are shops restaurants and restroom:

Slot machines - between the D gates

Walk toward the check in area --

Center of hallway
Starbucks - nearest the D gates

Left
Chili's
Hudson News
Welcome to LV store

Right
Red Mango
Metro Pizza
Restrooms

Center of hallway
Quiznos Sub - farthest from the D gates

Flies to/from this gate:
Hawaiian Air - right of D gate area
Delta - left and far gate area of D gate

It's nice, mildly air conditioned (it's August 2017), the floors are shiny and clean, chairs are leather looking and a cluster of them at each gate. There are TV monitors above the seating areas. There's a Rolex clock on the left facing the end of the terminal in the casino area just where the gate seating begins. Trash and recycle bins are at the walkway area just outside each gate seating area. Huge windows give you views of the airport and this Nevada, LV area.

Not too loud. There are charging stations on the right, Hawaiian Air side.

Loud speakers kinda loud enough to hear the boarding callls and not miss your flight.

Restrooms are clean and have lots of stalls but the doors open inward so it's a tight squeeze with not much room for you and your carry on to get in and out easily. Thankfully there's a heavy duty hook on the door. At the sinks, there is no counter or ledge to put your belongings. Papertowels are available.

There's a belt ppl mover heading to/from the check in area with more shops at the beginning of it:

LEFT
Brooks Brothers - fine men's shirts & women's clothing
TUMI - luggage backpacks
Hudson booksfore - sundries books
Tags - rhinestone glittery bags and accessories

RIGHT
XpressSpa - offers neck pillows body wellness accessories there are 3 massage machines and 8 massage full body length chairs!
Flip Flops - slippers sunglasses socks with professional team player images
Coach
M*A*C - cosmetics

CENTER
BOSE - home theater personal office sound systems
A huge stone rabbit :D"}
{"text":"Can't say too much because we were in and out? Very clean. Well Light. Very directional. Took a long time getting baggage but that doesn't reflect on the Airport."}
{"text":"Walk a quarter mile to find a dirty bathroom. Inside newer terminals it looks like a suburban strip mall swap meet. Dirty and tacky. Concourse is an obstacle course of everything you don't w by or need."}
{"text":"Ample shopping and restaurants. Healthy options as well. Starbucks, CPK, Chilis and fast food available. 

Make sure you get on the right tram or you'll go to C gates. 

Slots in Terminal if you didn't get enough action in the casino.

Great bagel shop near top of escalators.

Bathrooms always need attention - trash bins full and floors dirty (men's). The only significant negative which pulls the rating down from 4 stars to 3."}
{"text":"Have to stop in here while arriving and leaving to come back home. I have been to almost all the terminals all seem to be a bit busy most of the time. The C wing is great has several restaurants, small odds and ends shops, and snacks. There is of course slot machines all through out so you can hit that last big jack pot before leaving town."}
{"text":"Nothing spectacular for new arrivals. They do have slot machines, but saw nobody winning while I was waiting for my plane. Was told by an older slot player long ago to stay away from them. I would give a suggestion  that they have better signage to where parking, or pick up from ride shares. Very confusing if you arrive late. Departure went smooth and fast"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite airports in the world.  The shopping is fabulous, there are tons of restaurants and snack shops and you can play slot machines while waiting for your flight!  

The airport is clean and well laid out for such a large airport.  They have quick busses to the rental car center and taxis organized just outside of the baggage claim.  

If you have never been to Vegas you need to visit before you die as their isn't any place in the world like it.  

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I guess since I visit so many airports and eat at so many, that I should start posting about them. Where to start...all Ride Share in one location in the parking garage. Get your ride just before getting out there and they will tell you what stall to go to. Gambling everywhere! TSA can be long but moves quickly. Food, choices are average having choices like Burger King, and Port-for-sub. Terminal 3 has better choices, so if you have time, take the train to the D gates. The C gates choices are ok too. Jamba Juice, Starbucks, Pei Wei., (is that the spelling??) not my favorite airport, but not the worst. Don't forget to pick up some Ethel M chocolate, yummy! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Super cool Airport, one of the biggest ones I've been to, by the looks of it Las Vegas is still building on to it."}
