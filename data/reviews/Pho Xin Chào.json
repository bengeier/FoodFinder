{"text":"Heard about this new Pho restaurant just opened at yonge and steeles so I decided to go check it out with my friend. The restaurant's atmosphere is really aesthetic, the food was superb, their desserts are really good especially the flan. Really recommend anyone to come here to try, it was so good that my friends and i came here 2 days straight :) ."}
{"text":"Excellent meal! The chicken and beef with rice was perfectly done! The chicken was juicy and tender, the beef was not dry and not chewy. My husband has the vegetable crepe and it was surprisingly good. I had the bahi Mi chicken which was yummy. I was hopping for a more traditional sandwich but it was still good. This might be my new favourite Vietnamese spot, only time will tell."}
{"text":"I work near this new pho place so I came here by myself at lunch time for a quick bite. I ordered the house special pho and coffee cake. The food was pretty standard like you would get exactly what you expected. But, amazing customer service and super cute decor, I'll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Came here for a weekday lunch. Service was good but the food just seemed like any other pho place in Markham or Scarborough. The prices was pretty much around the same for pho places but for the location right on yonge and steels i would say its cheap. I would return if i am in the area and feeling for pho but wouldn't go out of my way just for this place."}
{"text":"I saw this place popped up a few weeks ago and was intrigued. Looked like a nice exterior, the sign was eye catching and minimalistic, with no cow in sight.  When you step in, it feels like a cafe. There's classy jazz music playing in the background. The decor is really fresh and modern; the flooring looks like a marble finish and the walls and counter have wood paneling.   I feel like I definitely should be ordering an earl grey with cheesecake in this joint.   But on to the food. We got the steamed rice roll with beef, the sate pho and the house special pho. The rice rolls were hors d'oeuvre size, but were tasty. The fresh mango rolled with the beef also was an unexpected surprise.   The pho broth I'd have to say was mediocre. It lacked the zing that I have come to know pho to be distinctive for. Also, I asked to add tendon to the sate pho since it only came with rare beef. They gave me 2 dime sized pieces and charged me $2.50. The total for that one small sate pho with tendon was $12.50 before tax...  I don't know if that's the best way to launch your business guys. The portion sizes definitely cannot compare with the pho powerhouses that are pretty ratty looks wise, but make up for 10x more value (ahem chunks of tendon) at almost half of the cost and fragrant as hell broth.   Shape up guys."}
{"text":"Lots of good things to talk about for this pho place.  1) Hot full peppers given is always a plus in my books. Cracking those open and adding them to the hot broth just adds some nice heat !  2) the tripe is cut into smaller pieces, unlike most pho places where they are huge and overpowering   3) tendons are also nice and chunky with a good mixture of tenderness and size. Usually bad tendons are fatty and can be mucousy..which can be a real turn off.  4) Broth had really really good flavor and didn't leave a heavy feeling at all. Just a tad salty, but everything tasted great and fresh!  I love pho and this place is my NEW go-to in North York, and I have been going to Pho VIET Xpress for years!. Really good Viet coffee and apps, with parking in the back as well!"}
{"text":"My favorite! This place is a little hidden gem. Everything tasted amazing, and great service extremely nice.  Defiantly going back"}
{"text":"Visited on a weekday around 1pm for lunch. There was only one other group seated but it probably didn't help that it was a snowy and messy day outside.   Ordered the large P1 (house special pho), which came promptly. The broth was nice and not too salty. Good servings of the brisket, tendon, and sliced beef - the beef balls in particular were quite good. Noodles could be softer but at least the portion was decent.  As others have said, the inside is very spacious, modern and clean. Service was very friendly as well! Parking can be a bit of a hassle as I found it a bit confusing to navigate (there is a lot in the back of the group of buildings off of Yonge) because the spots are reserved for each spot. But worth it for the good pho! 8.00 for a regular and 9.50 for a large (Apr 2018) so its pretty affordable. People need to know about this relatively hidden spot!"}
{"text":"We are always looking for a good authentic Vietnamese Restraunt and finally one has made it to Thornhill. The Restraunt is clean and beautiful, the staff is wonderful and the food is in my opinion the best so far in York Region. So happy you opened a restaurant here in Thornhill. We needed you!"}
{"text":"Very, very good rice rolls with pork. I love it! Mind you this is after I went for like a progressive dinner, after 5 sushi before I arrived as I was craving for Vietnamese food.   The pho was not bad. Find the beef a little over cooked. Broth was good. The Vietnamese coffee was good. I am not even a coffee drinker. But I really enjoyed the rice roll!   Decors were nice, service was friendly. Already told my brother and his girlfriend about this place. Will be back again for more rice roll   Today I was totally craving for some nice pho! Honestly, I was going to stop writing all yelp reviews, but to my followers and for those who asked about me, this business owner have encouraged me to write again, as he valued my opinions. He launched a very unique pudding, it was very smooth with a nice texture and nicely balanced with iced coffee. You want to push the pudding to the tip of your tongue to taste the smooth texture. Keep up and good work and excellent service!"}
{"text":"We ordered the chicken curry with banh mi, and I couldn't stop eating it. The toasty warm banh mi on the side is a perfect pairing with the curry. The curry portion was pretty big too -- we had to order an extra banh mi on the side because there wasn't enough.   I also really enjoyed the grilled pork in our noodle bowl. Tender and flavourful, with just the right amount of crispy.   We also order their house noodles and shrimp spring roll. While the sauce for the shrimp spring roll was delicious, I found their house noodles not too unique compared to other Vietnamese restaurants I've been. That said, I would still consider returning for the curry banh mi and the iced coffee.   It was a nice casual and trendy environment with spacious seating. I only wish that the location was easier to find and parking were more accessible."}
{"text":"With all the wonderful reviews, it seems that we certainly had a different experience.  I'd give 5 stars to the servers, but only 3 stars for the wait time to receive our meal and only 1 star for the meal.  My husband ordered the Rare Beef & Beef Balls Pho, and I ordered the Chicken Noodle Soup Pho.  He was not impressed with the Rare Beef, and I also found the broth was tasteless and the chicken was way overcooked and uneatable.  It seems so often, we get great service with bad food, or get great food but bad service.  I hope they improve their cooking skills, as they do excel on their customer service."}
{"text":"The food was very good and the atmosphere of the restaurant is really nice. The staff was incredibly friendly and made us feel welcome too. Definitely going again!"}
{"text":"I went back to have their special rice roll with pork, shrimp and mango and my goodness it was soooooooo delicious! I try to go back every other weekend!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stumbled upon this very cozy beautiful Vietnamese restaurant on yonge st. Everything was delicious. We are Vietnamese so we know when the food is seasoned well. Everyone here is so nice and helpful! We had the beef and chicken pho and the chicken wings with the nuoc mam sauce on it. It was finger licking good! The Vietnamese style flan was so creamy with just the right amount of sweetness! Yummy!  My husband said it hit the spot."}
{"text":"We stopped by for a late lunch on a Saturday. Food and service was great! Servers were attentive and food came out quickly. Our go tos Vietnamese restaurants are rare beef pho (rice noodle soup) and grilled chicken and spring roll bun (vermicelli). We enjoyed both dishes here. Also, like their modern decor. Only small issue is their parking, mainly street parking."}
{"text":"1st time, got grilled pork chops & beef pho to go. Staff were so friendly. Was told my order would be ready in 15 mins. Not even 10 mins passed & it's already done. Soup was amazing & pork chops' to die for! Definitely coming back for more! Excellent service paired with great food!"}
{"text":"Been here around 4 times now (even tried to come in before they had their grand opening - fail) so I guess it's time for me to write a review!  The first thing you'll recognize and appreciate when coming in is how nicely decorated the restaurant is. Tiny details such as the edison light bulbs, decorative plants and benches give the store a refreshing and welcoming feel. The background music quality speakers do add nice ambiance to the overall dinner experience.  The waiters are very polite, seem inexperienced but I'm sure he will get the hang of it over time. My first day here, he served dessert before my main arrived which was awkward since the dessert had ice which melts pretty fast. The owner came to ask how everything was and he seemed very sincere which I appreciate.   Aside from that the pho tasted great, not too oily (I do like it oily sometimes at some places) the cuts of meat are tasty and the portions are adequate. In my opinion the overall standard of the \"powerhouse pho\" locations have been lowered significantly lately which kind of makes this location stand out to me. I wished they had the option of having thick noodles but I loved the details in which they include a nice cilantro (?), thai chili and lime on the side (something you can't expect from some pho places now which I'm disappointed! ).  Another surprisingly great dish was the grilled chicken and pork. I absolutely love the fact that there is a slight char on the outsides and nice garnishes on top of the chicken. Brings a great flavor for the chicken especially when it's cook right. My only wish was if I could only order just the chicken - don't get me wrong the pork was also great but the chicken was another level for me and my family!   Overall my experience has been consistently great here, and I do hope to be a regular. The only challenge is probably doing the parking around the back. But... for some yummy food and great ambiance I think I'm willing to rough it out in the parking lot."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place because it is a true vietnamese owned restaurant. It has recently open and service was great, clean, easy to find, parking in the rear.   Room for improvement: food needs to come out at the same time. We were 6 and the spread of food delivery was spread over 45 mins - 1 hr not acceptable. They ran out of regular deep fried spring rolls and did not have dessert we wanted - inventory too small. Portions way too small especially within the first 3 months of grand opening. curry was too spicey and sot vang pho and house special pho not great. Broken rice and vermicelli were good. We ordered 3 Viet ice coffees and were all small portions.   We will not visit again which is too bad bc there are no other good Vit restaurants around."}
{"text":"The best vegetarian vietnamese style spring rolls I've had in Toronto.  They have yellow mung bean, taro, vermicelli, carrot etc inside.   Being not a vegetarian, I appreciated that the dipping sauce was a fish sauce like dip. If you are vegetarian though, you may want to inquire if the dipping sauce contains fish sauce.   The beef balls in the pho were yummy.   The pork banh mi was yummy too -- it was more like ground pork sausage/patty in it."}
{"text":"We came here for a weekend lunch. After perusing through the menu, we decided on the regular size house special beef pho and the curry with chicken. The server came by and asked if I wanted the curry with rice or with bread. Usually I prefer rice, but the server suggested the bread. It turned out to be toasted banh mi bread and was an excellent suggestion.  I thought the curry had the same flavor as some of the curries I made from curry cubes. That is to say I didn't find it particularly interesting or as good as some of the other Vietnamese chicken curries I've tasted at other restaurants. The pho was tasty, but I didn't think the broth was as flavorful as at other restaurants. However, the noodles were perfectly cooked and the beef was tender. The basil and the bean sprouts were fresh.  The interior of the restaurant was clean, bright, and modern. The servers were very friendly."}
{"text":"I actually really enjoy this place as a vietnamese myself I'm happy to see its owned by authentic northern vietnamese people. I like the fact that they have unique southern dishes that arent at your typical pho store either. Been here twice and will definitely come back if im in the area as I live downtown Toronto. Must get is the Banh Xeo and the steamed rice roll with beef sooo good. The pho broth is pretty flavorful too. Im quite picky about where I eat my Pho."}
