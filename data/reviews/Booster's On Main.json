{"text":"DO NOT GET POPCORN CHICKEN. Holy shit the popcorn chicken is not only tasteless, it has bones (soft and hard) in them. It hurt my tooth so bad when I bit down hard expecting NO BONES. Can someone please tell me why there's bones in my POPCORN chicken. Have you ever had to spit bones when you eat popcorn? Why you gotta do this kitchen?

This place has some nice dishes such as lamb skewers, peppers, eggplant, and okra. However I still think the skewer place in pmall has more authentic taste. This place is more of a white-washed version of Chinese skewers. 

We got the $1 oyster deal. The oysters are real small, by real small I mean they are quarter sized small. But it's so cheap so it's expected. We all had some weird stomachache afterwards. So never get cheap oysters again.

Service is real slow. By real slow I mean they never check upon you and it takes some real effort to flag a waitress down. You have to walk all over the place to find someone. 

Another thing that puts us off is that we realized they gave us an extra dish of lamb skewers. The dish of skewers were already cold since we didn't really pay attention to our table and we're talking. So when we told them you gave us an extra dish they took the skewers away and just brought it to the other table. YOU ARE SERVING COLD SKEWERS! Couldn't you ask the kitchen to make another one? Plus we were talking over the skewers the whole time so it is basically covered in our saliva. Holy shit it's disgusting.

The thing that's attractive about this place is the ambiance and decor. Unlike most skewer places, there's zero oil and grease indoors. You can walk out the place without smelling like a Chinese kitchen."}
{"text":"Wow. (And not in a good way)

A group of 6 of us arrived at 7 on Thursday night. We didn't make any reservations and the only table they said they had available was a smallish table for 4 in a half booth, which was fine and our fault. We just tried to fit 3 on the booth side and 3 in chairs. Since there wasnt much table space, when the servers never came to clean up our glasses or plates we just used the reserved table beside us to make room for our own table. 

It was a buck a shuck on Thursday so we decided to start with 30 oysters. The oysters were decent, however they gave us 4 thin slices of lemon. And a tiny cup of sauce - literally 2oz of sauce. For THIRTY oysters. When we asked for more sauce they said each addition little cup cost $1. They also had no horseradish either. It was terrible. The server saw our platter and comped us 1 more sauce but said anymore would have been $1. 

They barely came to check on us after. Each time we wanted something we had to flag someone down. No water. No nothing. No \"would you like another drink?\"

At the end of the night we got up, only to notice the table that was reserved beside us said the reservation was at 10pm. Needless to say we were not impressed. If they moved that table over to ours we would have had a more spacious meal. We left by 830pm and gave our business down the street at unionville arms."}
{"text":"A bar on Main Street with beer and plays sports games can't really go wrong. It's located a bit away from the Jake's side of Main Street and across from the Old Firehall Confectionary. The decor is typical dark British pub type of interior but it's actually anything but that, starting from their menu to their waitresses to their clientele. 

Firstly, their food is not your typical bar food. Rather than nachos and fries, it's sort of an asian izakaya type of food. There are quite a few variety of skewers, and while the taste is great, is a bit disappointing in quantity. Perhaps due to slow service (though I did visit on a busy night), when you wait 30 minutes for food it's pretty unsatisfactory when all that gets put onto your table are a few skinny skewers. Definitely not a place where you would leave feeling  too full to move. 

To their credit, they do serve beer by the tower which is great for a group. 

The waitresses are quite friendly when they come around the table, but they do get spread out since there's apparently a second floor above where the patio is. Took a quick peek at the upper level and it is not a dining  area. There are low chairs sort of like bottle service at a club, though where it lacks in loud pop music you do get in its place random people singing karaoke. Certainly a bit unusual. 

Haven't had a chance to try the full menu, but overall seems like a decent place to watch sports games with a fair number of TVs around. Definitely prefer the lively downstairs atmosphere."}
{"text":"Due to recent influx of Pokemon Goers in this area I definitely understand they're under staffed but they've been consistently under staffed even yesterday (Monday). Poor girl was running in and out serving tables and apologizing left and right.

Came here on two occasions both in attempt to catch Pokemons (not gonna lie) bu also wanted to stay out of people's way (i.e. crowding the streets) so found this perfectly located bar between three pokestops. Pro: they have Delerium on tap. Con: Food sucks. We ordered the popcorn chicken (a whopping $12 for a handful of popcorn chicken) and lamb skewers ($7 for 3 skewers). Both were lacking flavours - where is the 5 spice flavours? I asked for hot sauce but the waitress told me it's a dollar and I told her it's fine but her coming back with a teaspoon of Sirracha - c'mon seriously? If the food wasn't so bland, I wouldn't need hot sauce. Second time we came by, my friend wanted popcorn chicken, I advised him otherwise but he wanted it so bad. Okay, fine, he ordered it and hot sauce as well but she didn't charge him for it. But one thing in common is their popcorn chicken sucks. 

Service is also quite bad. Stood in the front for about 10-15 minutes to finally have someone greet us. Found our own table and waited another 10 minutes for water then 5 minutes for the menu. After ordering drinks, it came 15 minutes later and she said \"You're drinks are finally ready\" - uh... we ordered three bottled beer and another on tap. What were you doing? Growing the hops?

This place could have had a lot of potential. I hope they read this and fix the minor issues because it'll definitely improve in the long run. Once this Pokemon phase is over (if ever) patrons may not return knowing the quality of service and food."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night was able to get a table in the back right away for 6 people. Huge crowds outside due to the Pokestops. Actually was part of the crowd looking for Pokemon but got hungry so we decided to give it a try. For a bar, their food is decent. Had a classic ramen, I heard they're make their noodles in house but not sure. It was good and affordable a around $11. Their environment was dark with loud music but that's expected with a bar. 
I would not mind stopping by again for some eats or drinks. Especially when it's a great stop for those who play Pokemon go."}
{"text":"First time here, although the beer glasses weren't chilled before hand but my beer was cold enough. They have a dartslive machine, lots of TVs. Good to catch a game or a good conversation with a friend. They have $1 Fanny bay oysters on thursdays. They were big, meaty, and slightly briny in flavor. Fanny bay is not my number 1 choice of oyster selection but given prices, I wouldn't mind since a lot of the discount oysters are malplaque. They only have one type of oyster FYI. 
I ordered Lamb skewers, wings and Korean cabbage. I love the Korean cabbage since I couldn't make it at home the way how they \"grill\" it and it's SO flavorful and best accompanied with beer. Then I like the wings, they were juicy and not carrying the fishy scent. Last would be the wings out of the things I order cause it was ordinary to me yet the meat was tender and juicy."}
{"text":"I didn't know about this place until the (crazy) pokemon hunter friends (no I don't play personally, I actually have a life) that gather on main street told me about it.  This is a neat late night place to go to.  

Beware - It's hard to get a table if you arrive late!  This place can get packed.  

I came here mainly for drinks but ordered the Kimchi Poutine and I have to say I was not disappointed.  Good portion and tasted pretty damn good.

There are 3 dart machines and a beer pong table upstairs with an open lounge setup makes it easy for a bunch of friends to just go to chill and have fun.  Reasonably priced and the waitresses are pretty nice and friendly.  Makes for an interesting hangout spot uptown."}
{"text":"Overall - 3.0/5.0

They have now made the move over to Main St, Unionville which is definitely a much better location. Previously they were situated by 14th and Warden where Babyface used to be which was quite an obscure location with much less pedestrian traffic.

Featuring an Asian oriented tapas style menu with Chinese grilled skewers, deep fried appetizers such as Taiwanese popcorn chicken and even Japanese ramen just to name a few - this restaurant has quite a range of food offerings but overall did not stand out in any particular area.

Skewers - Had pork short ribs, beef tenderloin and New Zealand lamb.  The prices are higher than what you would normally find elsewhere at specialized skewer places but not as good. These were just alright and definitely needed more seasoning. 

Taiwanese Popcorn Chicken - These were subpar compared to many places. They were not really crispy and a bit on the oily side. 

Oysters - They serve Fanny Bays on Thursdays for a dollar each. It was decent but would have liked it more if they had provided a bit more options other than a basic marinara sauce.

Croquettes - Nothing special. Basically straight from the freezer and fried. Filling is just corn, carrots and potatoes. It reminded me of something you would get as a snack option when you're at a karaoke lounge.

Beer Selection - They have Delirium by the bottle at a reasonable price which is one of my preferred beers.

Waitresses were polite and you can tell that they have experience working in such environments. However, service was quite slow.

Overall, I would come back mainly for their oysters and the fact that you can chill on the patio along Main St. Food wise the quality is borderline mediocre."}
{"text":"I have to say that the possibilities of this kind of establishment are endless, yet I was quite underwhelmed. 

Decor does seem to be quite nice and modern, but the space was not used very well. There was a huge bar in the middle, a couple tables towards the windows, and then a cramped area in the back with tables. Not as much seating as there could have been, but it made due. The ambiance was way darker than it needed to be, as everything inside seemed to be decorated in black and the lights were super dim. 

The food was reminiscent of a night market, with their skewers and snacking options. However, everything seemed only half thought out. All the skewers we ordered tasted about the same and were just about mediocre at best. The Chicken Knuckles were unevenly seasoned as well, so only half of my skewer had any taste. The Ramen was the only thing that seemed to be like a meal, but the portion was very small, and definitely didn't fill me up like other ramen places. The noodles didn't have much chewiness to them, and the soup base was average.
With a look at the menu, it seemed more like the food here was catered towards snacking rather than a meal, but not worth the price they asked for. 

The service was okay overall. All the girls here seemed to have a specific kind of look, which I won't go into detail. You can go see for yourself. They did seem quite friendly when they came to the table though.

Overall, I was expected more from this, as some reviews seemed to really hype them up. I probably won't be back as it was like eating night market food, but it wasn't as good and cost more money."}
{"text":"Went there on a Friday night, it wasn't that busy. We ordered some beer, chicken knuckles and chicken wings. The food came way before the drinks. We had to remind them to get the beer. We finished the food before the beer came... The food was okay but if we can have the beer with the food that would be great. Anyway, there are probably better places out there for chinese skewers."}
{"text":"New spot in town.  My boyfriend and I loves a nice beer place that doesn't serve just bar food. And this is the place to be.  I ve been to many Chinese skewer places in Toronto. They either have bad food or bad atmosphere. This spot has everything the interior is nice and calm good music but most of all the food was great.  My fav was the lamb skewers and the spicy barbecue pepper.  We ordered a whole bunch of food and the bill was not bad at all. Beer selection was great too.  This place will def be our regular hangout spot."}
{"text":"The patio at Booster's On Main isn't the largest but there are a few tables for two to six people.  It overlooks the main portion of Main Street Unionville (right across from the Old Firehall Confectionery shop) and is *the* perfect spot for people watching!

The server gave us water and the menu in a decent amount of time (she was running around busy all night) but after we placed our order, it took a tremendous amount of waiting time... so much so that we had to flag her to ask about our food. 

One of the food items that Booster's featured is skewers (grilled using charcoal)!  We got the Chicken Wings on skewers and I was really impressed with this.  The entire chicken wing (with attached drumstick) was served to us on a skewer and I loved how it was so flavourful and seasoned.

The Tiger Salad had onion, cucumber, pepper, cilantro, dry tofu and peanuts tossed with spicy dark vinaigrette.  This was actually a really large salad!  There were tons of greens with the above mentioned ingredients.  It was a little spicy due to the vinaigrette but a unique-tasting salad."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out after hearing about their dollar oyster deals on Thursdays but when I got there they told me they didn't have fanny bays that day which I was looking forward to eating. My friend and I purposely went there for the oysters, not only did they not have what we want they only had 26 oysters left when we came in which was around 12:30AM. So we decided to get them all (which was also a bad idea). The oysters were served in what looked like a baby's piss bucket and they were tiny and didn't taste very fresh, not to mention they also had LOTS of shell bits (at least 2 shells per oyster). They also lacked dipping sauces for the oysters as well even though my friend and I aren't normally the type to use any sauces with our oysters, I still think having a variety of options would have been nice. We also ordered their deep friend oysters, which looked more like chicken nuggets and tasted terrible. The sausages we ordered was basically burnt (we couldn't see them burnt due to the poor lighting but we could definitely taste the burntness of them). 

On top of the poor lighting, I was blinded by the red and green lasers the entire time. The washroom sign was also not very visible (being blocked by the exit sign), the washroom also looked scary and ghetto. Service was also very slow because they only had 2 staff working. Our empty cups were never refilled with water. Overall experience was a huge let down, definitely won't be going back."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and was pleasantly surprised. Best dishes were the popcorn chicken, fried oysters, and sausage skewers. The beef and lamb skewers were good, but slightly overcooked. Try the Osmanthus Flower Plum drink - really yummy and comes in a cute little bottle. Will come back again to try other dishes!"}
{"text":"Another place discovered whilst playing pokemon.. this is the perfect spot and if you sit on the patio, you can reach 2, sometimes 3 of the pokestops that always has lure on it. *life hacks* 

This place looks sketchy and real mafia/triad-like from the outside but don't be intimidated. They have e-darts as soon as you go in, which can be a fun activity as you're getting your drank on. The inside isn't as small as it looks and they have tables everywhere. We were lucky enough to get a table for 8 outside where we could all catch 'em all. The night we went, they had run out of pretty much everything on tap so I got a delirium and I wasn't disappointed. We had ordered a bunch of stuff & seperated it all weirdly (I hate doing this, but if it has to be done.. then..) Our server Aleena was super understanding and she was so nice to us, even though we were pretty much the last table to leave & our combined bill was pretty much hell on earth. I tipped her extra and she definitely deserves it - working through the pokemon crowd nights, oh god. Although it took a long time to get us our drinks and food, I didn't mind it too much. When you're with good company, nothing really matters. 

Our table ordered a bunch of meat skewers and the guys said it was good, although the salt was indeed R E A L. I ordered the okra and I loved it. I don't usually eat okra but they didn't have many other veggies to offer, so I settled as I thought the finger peppers would be too spicy for me. The okra was spiced perfectly and it was definitely worth the $5/3 skewers. 

Generally really enjoyed my time here and would definitely come back for more beer & of course, pokemanz.

Ps. they have beer pong and more darts upstairs. Looks like a lounge and I prefer being upstairs anyway."}
{"text":"If i could give zero stars i would. It was TERRIBLE. We went on a thursday for the 1$ oysters . It arrived with a worm. They took it away and just removed the worm... I asked for horseradish and it was extra charge and it wasnt like the fresh horseradish it was creamy and nasty like mayo texture. 
The sangria was terrible as well. It was amost 40$  and there was zero fruits in it , barely any wine as welll. 
The service was slow as well , we could never find our server . 
The oysters were warm and many of them were weird looking and not edible . 
Would never come here again"}
{"text":"Good hangout place and tasty skewers! We ordered 3 dozen oysters but they didn't have enough to serve... Surprisingly, they offered all that they had left and gave us a discount. Score!"}
{"text":"I have been to Booster's when they first opened and twice since then. It's really sad to say that since their initial first months, the quality of the food has not improved...rather it has gotten a more disappointing over time. Our thoughts were to give any new business time to figure out some kinks and work it out but this is our most recent visit and here is the verdict:

Decor: It's a bar, you can't expect too much...but a non-sticky table would have been a plus.

Service: Our server was nice, but the trouble is that for the summer, we would have expected more than one server to wait on the entire restaurant. The poor thing had to tend the bar, host, take orders, and serve the food by herself. It's summer time during dinner hours...may want to get a bit more help. But then again...it was a wee bit quiet (only 2 tables).

Food:
First thing we got, and this is weird for us, was the beer ...and it was sour. A Heineken on tap tasted like someone decided a dash of vinegar would have been the perfect mix. The waitress tried her best to help but soon realized it was a lost cause and offered us a bottle instead (many thanks! - you are the reason there are 2 stars) 
In terms of food, I can fully understand why there were only 2 tables present...the skewers were way over seasoned...to the point where the meat flavour had disappeared behind a wall of cumin, pepper, and a handful of salt. You cannot distinguish the texture of the foods or the flavours of what you had when your senses are blinded by an overdose of seasonings. 

Overall...price to quality is very off. Thanks, but I'm happier going next door for my skewer fix."}
{"text":"My friends and I were looking for somewhere to have dinner and we figured there's got to be a place in Unionville. Boosters caught our attention and none of us had been there before so we decided to give it a try.

It was kinda dark inside and we got the impression it was more bar than restaurant but we figured we'd at least take a look at the menu. We were right. The menu was more bar food than meals but there were some interesting items that we thought we'd try.

The house specialty is food on skewers so we ordered lamb, pork ribs, beef, chicken wings, and mushrooms on skewers. We also decided to try the Korean Fried Chicken and the Popcorn Pork Ribs. We later added some live oysters that were on special for $1 each.

The Popcorn ribs were lightly dusted and deep fried. Tender and crispy. Nice. Same for the fried chicken. Delicious. All the skewered dishes were nicely grilled and had a natural tasting smokey flavour. I really liked the mushrooms.

Overall, we enjoyed the food and some drinks and we;ll be back, maybe not for dinner, but we'll be back."}
{"text":"Get the beef tenderloin and lamb skewers. They were my fav! Also the whole fresh squid was amazing with the five spice seasoning. The seafood salad was also pretty good along with the popcorn chicken. I loved the food here. Great snack foods to go with some alcohol. Service was fast and on point! I just think some items could be a bit lower in price for the portion size. Would come again. Great resto to mix things up in the Unionville area. 4 stars ****"}
{"text":"Love this place! They have drinks and also snacks. They have great music, pretty lights and even an upstairs lounging area with big spacious comfy seats. They have two bar areas and also a patio area as well.

Their waitresses are really friendly and nice. If you're bored, you can always play darts upstairs or liar's dice with friends! It's a great spot to lounge and have a good time."}
{"text":"Came here to try their charcoal lamb skewers; in my opinion, didn't have enough flavour, lacking cumin taste.. Which is really easy to fix.

Tried a whole bunch of items on their menu, popcorn chicken, Taiwanese fried chicken, taco wasabi, calamari, chicken wings, beef skewers, Chinese sausages, rib skewers, gizzards... I felt the flavouring needed more work.. But that's just my opinion. Some of my friends said it was good and others felt the same as me.

Been here a few more times (this is the only Asian style bar food on Main St). The food, in my opinion did get better. Can't wait till summer to come here with friends and just sit on the patio to drink beer and eat skewers while checking out Main Street!! Will definitely be back and recommend to others.

Overall experience is good, Korean waitresses are hot!!

Nice place to throw darts, watch sports on tv, and chill out on Main Street!!!

Once summer comes around, I'm sure the smell and sight of the lambs skewers will just sell itself!!!

Super happy they have this type of food on Main Street now!! Price is not bad considering its Main Street. Love chilling on Main Street in the summer time!!"}
{"text":"Chill place to hang out with friends. They also got darts to play while having a drink. Appetizers are good, gotta get the chicken. Fun times, chill times. Got more stuff upstairs tho I didn't go upstairs. Chill Atmosphere, nice people."}
{"text":"Below average restaurant at main st. 
I was craving for ramen, and it was at around 4 tried kiu restaurant near the theater but it was close so we decided to try this place since i remember seeing the ramen during ufest. Bad decision. I would never get ramen from a Chinese place again. It didnt satisfy my craving at all. Id rather make instant noodles at home. 
Got the takowasabi it was good but double the usual price of it. I guess they could do thay since theyre in main st. The decor doesnt match the food. And there are no real entree in this placr just skewers. 
I wouldnt go back for food(dont recomend food here too) but maybe drinks if the rest of the patios full. :("}
{"text":"love this place. They have beer pong, darts, karaoke, etc. Make sure you call in advance to make a reservation. A cool place to chill/hang out."}
{"text":"This isn't bad for youngsters who want a hip cozy sports bar to hang out with friends. Albeit crowded because of the now Pokemon Go craze the food ain't bad at all . More of for hanging out than getting your family meal kind of place . Service is great , food is just okay."}
{"text":"Dear EVERYONE , SAVE YOURSELVES A TRIP! The manager is completely unreasonable! We ordered drinks and they were UNDRINKABLE ! The manager actually admitted that their drinks were pretty much premixed in a bottle and the bartender was just adding ice . When I was not satisfied with the second drink they made because it tasted like water and sugar the manager told me he would not comp the drink even though my bill was WELL over 100$ ! Customer service was non existent and the only eatable thing I ordered was the chicken! It was UNACCEPTABLE!! STAY AWAY! Save your money! If you don't care for your customers you don't deserve anyone else's business !!! ** STRAWBERRY DAIQUIRI**  ( if I could have given 0 stars I would have ! )"}
{"text":"So once again I'm back to poke hunt. 
As this is the restaurant that sits in the middle of the most popular 3 stops, my boyfriend insisted we come here @_@.

Their pina colada is still amazing.  My boyfriend ordered the fried chicken this time and it was soo delicious.  The skin was crispy but it was also so juicy. Even half a chicken is enough for 2 if you're not starving. 
However the seafood salad was below average. Their salmon tartare was fully cooked instead of being seared ): and the shrimp looked like it was disintegrating into pieces. Damn. 

This place is decent but not something I'd crave."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out. Nice beer, chinese snack and beer food. It's a good mix between the eastern food and the western drink."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Server put in the wrong order because she didn't bother to reconfirm my order at the time of ordering. Food took forever to come and the ramen sucked."}
{"text":"My friends heard about this place and wanted to give it a try. Located on Unionville Main Street you would expect the usual restaurant/bar like Jakes and Unionville Arms with standard bar food like burgers and chicken wings, but this place took a different take; namely Asian. The restaurant/bar has two levels; both with their own bar. On the ground level you will find dining tables and comfy booths. Whereas the upstairs is more lounge style, perfect for a few drinks and watching the latest game on tv. On the menu, you won't find burgers and fries, instead there are Japanese style appetizers like Izakayas, Korean style fried chicken, and charcoal skewers. All the food is very flavourful and perfect with a few beers. The servers and manager Frank was very friendly and helpful explaining some of the items on the menu that I wasn't familiar with. I came here for dinner today, but I'll definitely be back to test out the lounge upstairs another time"}
