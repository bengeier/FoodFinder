{"text":"Love coming here! Usually busy but busy means good! Staff are friendly and always walking around with samples if you have to wait for a table!!"}
{"text":"I guess everybody thinks they know what Joey's is about but I like this Crowfoot location.  The fish and chips were great and my waitress, a young Venezuelan/Canadian girl, was an absolute doll.  Really friendly and helpful.  It's a quick and reasonable place for lunch, only $8.00.  The decor is downright homey and parking is free and right outside the door."}
{"text":"I work right near Joey's, so I can smell the fish most of the time and every now and then it draws me in.  This place is always buzzing in the evening, sometimes parking can be slim pickings, like on all you can eat Tuesdays.  Having not been here in over a year I decided to grab some food to go.  I was greeted right away by the man at the til.  I ordered the Haddock and chips for my Husband and I, 2 pieces for $13, so it cost me close to $30.  They have a great deal with their Joey's fish, 2 sides, shrimp or clams for $13.  It cost another $3 to $5 for an additional piece of fish.  They have a very extensive menu, including wraps, salads, rotisserie chicken, so there is something for everyone!  I waited about 15 minutes.  When I got home my food was piping hot, the fish was a good size and crispy, not doughy.  Though the fries weren't very crispy, but you got a decent portion.  We also got a little coleslaw, which was quite good.   Joey's fish is excellent, the prices are decent, the staff seems nice.  Overall it is a good place to get your fish and chip cravings met!"}
{"text":"Always good food and good service!  Crowded  sometimes so avoid rush hours! I love chicken lettuce wraps and my son the bbq ribs! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Ordered the 1/4 lb halibut and chips, it came to $21. The piece of fish I got was the same size as my IPhone SE. The fries were so over salted with seasoning salt they were inedible. Worst fish ever."}
{"text":"I took my family here today. The kids had burgers from the kids' menu, so no complaints there.  I had the clam chowder to start, which was the white cream New-England style. It was good ... not great. And my wife and I shared the coconut panko shrimp appetizer ... which was a bit small considering the price, and greasy and over-fried. Both get a passing grade, nothing more.  Then, my wife's fish tacos and my lobster grilled cheese sandwich came. The tacos were good! Joey gets a good grade for these! But my lobster sandwich had problems: The execution was fine, the chefs did exactly what was asked of them. But why drown out the flavour of the lobster with the double-cheese and grilled bread? I could barely taste the lobster over the rest of the sandwich, despite the lobster supposedly being the main attraction!  The kids got ice cream sundaes as part of their menu options. Both devoured it with gusto! Thanks, Joey! You fed my kids great.  We ordered the cheesecake, which obviously came from a delivery truck a few days earlier, and was freshly unfrozen the day we ate it. We couldn't finish it, since it was so clearly bolted together in a factory.  This place kept the kids happy, and us fed, but definitely not well-satisfied.  One thing: the service was excellent, and I got the sense that the team and management were working hard to address other peoples' complaints about inattentive and negligent service. We were very happy with the service and the people we met. I get the sense they are trying."}
{"text":"We don't go hear very often but my little guy loves the fish here. Took him for lunch and the staff here are always so wonderful. We were greeted and sat down promptly.   Ordered a fish and chips for the little guy and coconut shrimp for myself. The portions are great and we waited under 15 minutes for food.it was lunch time so very impressive for a busy place.  The coconut shrimp was delicious. I tried a few of my little guys fries and they were great as well. His fish portions were huge, so he didn't eat it all but he loved it.  Our super nice waitress brought over the bill and a balloon for my little guy (nice touch) we paid and then on the way out looked at the fish in the tank. They are small tropical fish, so not to worry that they are the fish on the menu. Lol   Great lunch. Quick service. Excellent staff. We will be back again when we are craving fish."}
{"text":"This is our favorite place to go for consistent food and very friendly service. We go about once a a week and we're very pleased! The food is awesome."}
{"text":"We used to have Joey's in the Twin Cities metro in Minnesota. It was one of my favorite places to eat. The food was tasty. I was sorry to see them leave this area."}
{"text":"Every Sunday we choose a place to pick up from and picnic in some random park we stumble upon! Today was my pick, Joey's as I love seafood. Ya, it is mostly if not all frozen but this is what I chose for some coconut shrimp and clam chowder! Feed the craving! M chose Joey's Own fish tacos with a side order of greens and rice. To go, you have to ask for napkins, cutlery, lemon, extra crackers etc. The whole lot came to $26, not too bad and off we went. This is how we reconnect - no TV, no phones, no distractions, kind of a date-day if you will and we are really able to focus on the food and each other. Clam chowder was OK, needed more clams but is that not always the way? Coco shrimp were deelish and it comes with a spicy Thai chili sauce. M's meal was good, the fish tacos were good, greens fresh, rice was of the wild variation and was good! No real complaints and the weather has been so nice lately, a picnic was the only option. The down side of our experience was the pick up. The service was crap, the hostess was sick and hacking all over the place.  I noted a sign up front whereby Tues nights are All U can Eat fish and chips! Cool!  The place was fairly busy for being after 7pm on a Holiday Sunday night.  3 stars."}
{"text":"We live in the NW and usually go to the Crowchild Tr location(across from McMahon Stadium), but we found that the service and quality at that location has been going downhill lately!      When we decided to come to the Crowfoot location, we were pleasantly surprised.  The Tuesday all-you-can-eat fish and chips were delicious as usual, but the menu also included Japanese shrimp tempura rolls as appetizers.  We also saw some menu items on the chalkboard that weren't offered at the other location.    This restaurant is also extremely kid-friendly; one time they were giving out helium balloons to all of the kids!   However, on busy nights, parking can sometimes be a challenge."}
{"text":"Good portions , good service! Had fish taco and lobster bisque. Service was attentive, and helpful. Good spot for family dinner"}
{"text":"We normally go to the location on Crowchild Trail across from McMahon Stadium (and the one in Salmon Arm when we're in town), but last week we decided to try the Crowfoot location again after years away. Service was pleasant, the all-you-can-eat fish Tuesday special was fresh, lightly battered as usual, with crisp fries and a small side of coleslaw. We even got to use their free WiFi (ask nicely, they might give you the password)."}
{"text":"Not bad at all!   I haven't eaten at Joey's in YEARS, but when Raissa R. and myself were hungry for an inexpensive (but not fast food) dinner, we decided on fish & chips! This place brings me back, as my dad used to take us here as kids all the time.   Surprisingly, it wasn't that busy, and I was amazed to see how many different types of dishes they offer! They have a TON of menu items, and they all look delicious. I guess as a kid the only thing I was interested in was the fish & chips, so I decided to stick with what I knew and ordered 2 pieces of the halibut with fries. Raissa ordered the Shrimp Trio, and before we knew it our plates were in front of us! The fish was just how I remembered it, very light and crispy, and not greasy at all. The pieces were HUGE, next time I'll stick with 1 instead of 2...portions are extremely generous. The shrimp was fabulous, especially the coconut! I was also pleased at the wine selection, and had a nice glass of white to go with my meal. I was pleasantly surprised that afterwards, I felt satisfied - not gross, like I do after greasy fish & chips elsewhere. An added bonus was the Yelp Check In offer for a free fish taco - we both got one each and took them home for her boyfriend to enjoy!  All in all it was a great dinner for an affordable price. I'll definitely be back, next time for the Tuesday All-You-Can-Eat!!"}
{"text":"Dear Yelpers,   I'm sad to report that we need a button for no stars and pure dislike. Tonight our family decided to get fish n chips- Friday 8pm. It was half empty and we were seated quickly right by the kitchen. Our waitress was polite and then we waited 40min before I asked if they were having issues with short staff or something else. She said other folks were waiting an hour as the kitchen was \"catching up from an earlier mad rush.\" Told her to find out if they started cooking our meal yet and if not we'd leave. She said they had not but were willing to give us a 50% discount for our next visit. All sounds fair right? Here's what you don't know...  For the 40min while we waited, we heard every word the kitchen staff said. They were talking up a storm using the f word and my 10yo son even said they need to stop that and focus on their task. I'm willing to tolerate some smack talk but this was ludicrous! Coming from a restaurant background, this was unacceptable especially when customers are in earshot! It is inappropriate, immature and offensive. I could hear that they were disorganized and making 1 tables order at a time not actually making any effort to speed up let alone keep up.  I have written to Joeys head office to notify them of our experience. I love their fish but the past few times have been horrid. The food was not hot, the service was slow, the bathroom floors are sticky where you have to lift your shoe up...I could go on. Please do NOT visit Joey Seafood Crowfoot or McMahon Stadium. They've completely gone downhill in the past 2-3 years despite efforts to renovate the decor. I will not return. Keep your 50% discount on my next meal."}
{"text":"I made the mistake of ordering lobster macaroni. It was 15$ and the quantity was equivalent to an appetizer, from the kids menu....You are better off going to red lobster and getting a proper meal for a few bucks more.  They need to remove this from the menu. Very deceiving."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of suburban chain restaurants, but Joey's has changed my mind in a good way. Stopped here on a fluke last night whilst shopping at the Crowfoot shopping center. Of the many chain restaurants in this strip mall, this was the highest rated. And we've been wanting to try Joey's for a while. We walked in and were informed there was a 60 minute wait for a table, but were told we could hover over the bar and grab a seat there on first-come, first-serve basis. There were other \"hoverers\" there but for some reason nobody was making a move. So we went over to a 6-top table occupied by just one couple, politely asked if we could join them. Sure! So we waited all of 30 seconds for a seat despite the 60 minute wait time. This was a 6:30pm (there was almost zero wait by 7:30pm; people sure eat dinner early in the suburbs!). But back to the review. We were immediately approached by lovely waitress Valeria. In fact the entire staff were super attentive. We noticed the manager lady with the curly red hair was constantly making the rounds and even pitching in with bussing tables and delivering drinks. Now to the food: SCRUMPTIOUS. Wife and I shared the herb salmon, and added the prawn skewer. The fish was perfectly cooked, beautifully presented, with mashed potatoes and seasonal veg, all washed down by Last Best IPAs. The atmosphere looks classy minimalist, and you would think by the staff uniforms and interior decor that it was a high-end restaurant; but most of the clientele were casually dressed in t-shirts and jeans. The crowd aged in range from families to seniors and everyone in between. The open-plan kitchen that is part of the dining room is always a good sign that the restaurant has nothing to hide. The bathrooms were super clean and obviously well maintained. There are TVs in the bar area showing the NHL and NBA playoffs, and there is chillax music playing throughout. Near the end of the evening we moved over to the bar and got to chatting with some of the friendly young and beautiful staff.   This seems a good point to bring up the \"eye candy\" theme. The Joeys chain prides itself in hiring all attractive women and a few token good-looking men. (Just google \"Joeys\" +  \"waitresses\" or \"high heels\" for a variety of news articles on this subject). If a company wants to have archaic hiring practices, that's their business but it's something clients should be aware of upfront. That said, the young and beautiful staff were all superb, friendly, well-trained and most importantly -- experienced and hard-working staff that seemed to genuinely take pride in their work and in the lost art of customer service."}
{"text":"Adding this restaurant to my NO SALT restaurant list.  We have a family member who cannot eat a lot of salt and this restaurant can comply with how we want the meal prepared.  Joey's can make fish and chips with with salt or seasoning at all.  Eat the fish and chips with malt vinegar provided on the table and all is well!    Thanks, Joey's!!"}
