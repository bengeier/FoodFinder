{"text":"This might just be the best Indian food I have ever had. From the moment you walk in you feel welcomed. All vegetarian and and the most wonderfully flavorful dishes. Our new go to Indian spot!"}
{"text":"One of the best Indian restaurants I've been to, and I've been to many! What a pleasure to see a 100% vegetarian menu! Food is delicious and authentic. Must go!"}
{"text":"OMG the food is amazing. I am by no means a vegetarian, but dang if I could eat like this everyday it wouldn't be hard to become one! My mom and I went to the lunch buffet and tried everything. It's a huge buffet, everything is delicious, and each dish has its own unique flavor. The workers were super nice and even brought us some kind of curry potato crepe that wasn't on the buffet, and they didn't charge us for them. Idk if they usually bring crepes with buffet orders, but it seemed like they wanted us to try it because we were new customers. The only thing is you have to get there early! Once the food runs out, that's it! They don't refill any of the dishes. 

They gave us a coupon for next time after telling them how much we enjoyed their food. I will definitely be going back. This is some of the best Indian food in Maricopa county for sure!"}
{"text":"The best Indian (especially South Indian) food in Phoenix. The lunch buffet and dinner ala carte choices are both very good. The \"sambhar\" (a lentil based gravy) is possibly the best in the valley. The mango lassi is quite good. The Gobhi Chettinad dosai, Kothu Roti, Sambhar Vada are our favourite dishes. The lunch buffet typically has a soup, rasam, idly, vada, steamed rice, flavored rice, 2 north indian gravies, a dal, naan, chutneys, raita, dahi/yogurt vada and atleast 2 desserts - a sumptuous spread indeed. Service is mostly good. Prices are very reasonable and they are always willing to customize dishes where possible."}
{"text":"Average food, extremely rude staff and a greedy owner.

Since the first time I went to this place a couple of years back till today this restaurant has been nothing more than disappointment. The food is average or below average, just to recall the incident last time when I ordered a dessert(Ras Malai) it was served un-thawed right out of  the box which I could have picked up in Asiana for 1/8 of the cost I paid here, the food when served usually does not meet the fresh out of kitchen standards and sometimes is cold.

Now coming to the staff, this is the worst place you could go, I remember an instance when the waiter made us sit for like 35 minutes and then came with headphones on to take order !!!  No special requests are entertained and the staff generally lacks courtesy and basic humility. I believe staff behavior to be a reflection of the owner and based on my multiple experiences I would say the owner himself needs to take a few lessons in hospitality, he is rude and unaccommodating and yes extremely greedy. Let me explain the greedy part, for 3 times in a row he added gratuity of 18% even when he was not serving to a group, I can understand adding gratuity for a group of 4 which is a common practice but not in Anand Bhavan, they will not spare you even when you are alone or there for a buffet. 

Now lets talk about their Groupons which they release, last week six of us went with two Groupons and requested them if they could honor our Groupons if we ordered separately, but the owner refused to entertain our request even when we were seated at practically two physical tables citing that they served to a group on 6 and what can you say slapped a gratuity of 18%..

The last thing which is more of a personal observation and could be matter of debate, the owner and staff are more entertaining to the American customers than they are to the south Asian community, we were de-prioritized and served later than the couple who came later than us but again this might be a stand alone incident..

Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone, if you have another choice spare yourself and avoid Anand Bhavan..Don't spoil your day.."}
{"text":"I saw this place and wanted to take my partner there, we both try to eat vegetarian as much as possible. Showing up on a weekday morning at 11am in order to get the freshest off the buffet, we were NON-greeted by the host talking on the phone. He talked on the phone at least a good 6 minutes before coming to seat us. We never saw him again.

But we give it four stars because the food was well worth it. It was delicious, fresh and 100% vegetarian with vegan choices as well. The paneer was FABulous! We will be returning but whoever that rude man is needs to find another job...the DMV comes to mind."}
{"text":"A few days ago, we ate here for the first time. We had the lunch buffet. The restaurant is fairly clean and the staff is very friendly. The buffet is priced right. I wish  they had more than 4 main dishes to try, but what they had tasted good. They didn't really have what I would call desert. Also, there was no fruits. They bring you Doosa with your food; it's great. By the way, this is a vegetarian restaurant.
Our overall experience was ok.
We'll dine here again and see how it goes next time."}
{"text":"I went on Diwali with my family and we all faced stomach problem after eating their vada which was not good in taste either. Other wise southindian dishes were not good and north indian dishes where ok."}
{"text":"Great service, nice menu and average quality food . 26 dollars for buffet lunch for three with the coupon from the news paper. Have tea in the menu, so that's nice. Tap water is better here, seems they filter it."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegetarian but I really like their lunch buffet. It's all so delicious and I like that they don't always have the same thing. 

The food has good taste and spices and it's hot but in a enjoyable way! I very much have enjoyed their soups and usually use a carrot stick to cool off my mouth."}
{"text":"Was skeptical at first ... given I saw poor reviews by other and given they are all veggie.... 

BUT I found this south indian place a delightful surprise ... went for a sunday buffet lunch and the selection was plentiful and taste was favorful .... And my indian friends all love this place

Love the dosa (it is pancake like texture that the waitstaff bring to the table fresh made)... and Rasam (signature soup from s.india from what I heard) ... everything else taste really good too .... 

Service is pretty good, our dosa kept on coming :)  
Perfect for a sunday brunch/lunch with a nap as a chaser (you probably need it as it is heavy on carb and do make you feel lazy ;-)"}
{"text":"Uh-no! Huge Mistake. 
The Dosa was extremely dry, well let's say Papad types. The sambar too spicy without any taste. Chutney was bearable but I still haven't figured out what the other red thing was in my plate! The girl who was serving the food wasn't really aware of which dosa she had in the plate. It is overpriced for no reason!"}
{"text":"Great prices and very nice service! There were lots of options on the menu, and they were very helpful with answering our questions. We ordered the mango lassi, garlic na'an, chana masala with batura, and the coconut uthappam. Everything was delicious. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"The interior of the restaurant photos on the web are not representative of the inside of the restaurant. In reality the paint is chipping off the walls, the floor is painted concrete and sticky. The buffet was less than mediocre at best."}
{"text":"This is an update to my previous review. I have given it one more star than before because i found a way to only experience the food and avoid possibly bad service...go for the lunch buffet. The buffet is decent and as mentioned before the high scores are due to its location in this part of town."}
{"text":"horrible food.very bad experience, disappointement for us.spoilt the name of  so called south indian restarant.all old food, yesterdays left overs are todays menu for lunch buffet.very bad service.sambhar was very watery.gulab jamun was very hard and elastic and not soft. veg briyani was also only left overs of previous days.all desserts were not fresh , everything previously made a day or before.naan was also horrible.total waste of money and time.i will not recommend this to anyone and will not go back again.on the whole what i say is lunch buffet is all nothing but yesterdays left overs is todays menu .i feel very bad to give even 1 rating.there was no option for zero rating."}
{"text":"Its under new management and has amazing authentic food. The new owner is amazingly friendly.
The taste is food is marvelous. They have started under new management and really need a visit. I oder the dosa everytime I am here."}
{"text":"At lunch it's the buffet only. No service. I had lots of questions and nobody to answer them. It might be better after 5pm."}
{"text":"Nice portion sizes. It's more expensive than it should be, but I'll keep coming here. 

We ate here on a sunday night and our waiter was fine. Pleasant even. 

The food was hot, flavorful and seemed as if someone had actually made it...and not just heated up."}
{"text":"We drove 18 miles for this restaurant and we ordered appetizers which were half cooked and then for main course we ordered vegetables along with naan, kulchas , kulchas came after 45 min and by that time vegetables were all cold, lacha paratha were weird, it seemed they friend frozen roti and served us. I have never seen such bad management where they did not cared for their customers."}
{"text":"Very bad experiences!! Had ordered naan gave me phulkas instead in a to go .. And butter paneer not at all good .. Basically it's just too expensive for the food which is not worth spending that much . Instead I've had better food from other places."}
{"text":"Food is excellent, but service is PAINFULLY slow...even with me being the only diner present. Also, they did not have rice at the time I ordered because the chef was \"off\". Ummmm. However, the rice was brought out mid meal and I was given extra naan to compensate. 

It is a great place, very clean, and the servers are very polite. I just am hesitant to come back unless I have time for a leisurely meal. Perhaps they could invest in hiring an extra server to have the overall customer experience a five star?"}
{"text":"Most of the Indian restaurants serve north Indian food. I was looking for something different, and decided to visit the Madras Ananda Bhavana based on the positive reviews on Yelp. Thankfully, I was not disappointed.

The quality of their food was surprisingly authentic - the medu vadas, the idlis and the (freshly prepared) masala dosas were awesome! I almost felt like I was in a Udipi restaurant in Bangalore...the level of spice was toned down, probably to better suit the palate of the locals.

There aren't too many Indian restaurants that serve vegetarian food and this place more than makes up for the lack of meat! The kadai paneer or the bagara baingan have enough punch to knock off your cravings for the ubiquitous chicken tikka masala & co.  

The service was good and prompt. In all, an absolute value for money deal for people looking out for south Indian meals."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday to try it for lunch. Everything was great. The place was very clean and nice, the service was excellent, and the food choices on the buffet were 
plentiful and very authentic and tasty. It's about time we had a great Southern Indian place in this area and now we do. Thank you very much for giving us something besides the usual chicken tikka, aloo gobi, daal, saag, and a piece of naan. I mean, I like those dishes, but after 20 years of eating them, I'm a bit tired of them and crave the tasty vegetarian dishes from Southern India. And soooo tasty!  I'll be back here many times and thanks again for putting your heart into making the food so nice.
It shows and see you soon!"}
{"text":"During initial days the quality of the food was too good, now it has felt down drastically.. Still good option to have Indian Veggie food for people living nearby."}
{"text":"I have been to many Indian restaurants and this one rates very well.
Don't be fooled by the domestic looking tables and chairs, the food is awesome!
I really appreciated the staff's attention to detail and patience with us as we ordered.
Took the food home and it was great. Nephew who hadn't had Indian food for a while loved it. His Beingan Bartha was a bit spicy for him, but he still loved it.  The Ven Pongal Vadai was delicious!
I will be back with more of my friends and I suggest you take yours too."}
{"text":"The restaurant is in a strip mall at Bell and 32 Street. There is a large variety of food choices and every dish was delicious. The helpings were generous and the food was reasonably  priced. Our server was very helpful and personable. We will definitely make this a regular \"go to\" spot"}
{"text":"New management and a pleasant change.. Food tastes much better.. The ambience has improved.."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. My family eats here about once a week. If anything were to be as close to home made this would be it. That being said, recipes vary. One day the dish may be spicy or salty or sour and the next day it's not. It is quite delicious even with the variables. If you are new to this style of Indian food I suggest trying the Spring Veg Dosa, Masala Dosa, Puri Masala, Batata Vada and Paneer Pakora. Even non-vegetarians enjoy what they have to offer. Also, lots of gluten free options."}
{"text":"This place is probably the best Indian restaurant in Phoenix. Granted, it's the only one I've tried - but why go somewhere else when you've found the best?? They have amazing, authentic food, with a wide array to satisfy practically anyone. The service is great too, very friendly, and the servers are always willing to give their opinion. We've been here at least six times and we've never had a complaint! Always great food and great service!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a good vegetarian Indian restaurant near Scottsdale, and was encouraged to try this based on the other positive reviews as well as a Groupon.  Our dinner was a delight in every way:  prompt, friendly and attentive service on a Monday night; huge selection of interesting and appetizing South Indian dishes; and best of all, extremely fresh, tasty and well-seasoned food.  The Mulligatawny soup was surprisingly creamy, light and flavorful. I really enjoyed the lively mix of flavors and textures in the sweet and tangy Behl Puri.  The Mysore Masala Dosai was tender and crisp with a clean and fresh potato filling served with wonderful condiments including an outstanding tamarind sauce.  Every place makes Saag Paneer a little differently, but this was as good as it gets, with perfectly firm cheese cubes and clearly garden fresh spinach and herbs.  The portions are large and the prices quite reasonable, especially considering the freshness and quality of the food.  Can't wait to go back and work my way through the rest of their delicious menu."}
{"text":"It's a shame that I have to give this place only 2 stars, because the food is phenomenal!  But the service is just plain TERRIBLE!  EVERY single time we've gone in (and it's been about 6 or 7 times), we've waited up to over an hour for our food to come out.  I don't understand why they won't hire extra help at this place.  They obviously have the business, and need more staff on when it is crowded.  We even sat for over 15 minutes one time waiting just to get a server to come to our table.  I wanted to leave after 5 minutes, as I find this unacceptable, but my boyfriend convinced me to stay so we could use our groupon.  As much as I LOVE their food, I will not be returning after the groupons are used up, as the service is just downright unacceptable.  The ONLY way to go is to do the buffet, as you serve yourself, but then there's less choice in food."}
{"text":"The food was ok. I got a groupon for this restaurant because I love Indian food.  It was very busy (6:30 on a Friday) but it took 5-10 min after we were seated for the waiter to even come to our table.  (There was a pitcher of water on the table, but I wanted something with ice) My boyfriend got his meal first and then a few minutes later I got my meal.  I just wasn't impressed with the service, and since we had to drive 20 minutes to get there I doubt we will be going back."}
{"text":"samosa had stale potato. sambar was stale.
Experienced Staff members are very rude with newer staff members in front of guests."}
{"text":"This place is used be very good but as more and more people going to this place owner has taken things granted. This place is getting worse and worse day by day. Customer service is getting very poor. Rates has been increased. discriminating behavior towards Indians. Ordered mango lassi but served water with yogurt and some color in it. Asked to bring pickle get the time we done with the dinner and so on........ I am sure how there are positive reviews for this business.

Please don't go to this restaurant any more."}
{"text":"We landed in Phoenix and were surprised to learn that there was a restaurant that had Madras in its name. Furthermore it had really good reviews that only added to our hunger. So we decided to give this place a shot for our dinner!

We ordered sambar Vadai, masala dosa and chettinad Gobi masala dosa. None of the dishes lived up to the name Madras!!! The Vadai was really very hard and it seemed like it was made in the morning (at least we hope it wasn't any earlier than that). The dosas were a little sour and that is a clear no-no for anyone from madras. The service was slow because they were understaffed that day."}
{"text":"I feel like we really lucked out when we found this restaurant a few months ago.  I'm extremely picky when it comes to restaurants and food, so just going in because it was a vegetarian place to eat and ending up having the great service and excellent food was absolutely wonderful.

The service has been very friendly and efficient, and after ordering the food always comes out so fast that I have no idea of how they do it!  Our last visit was perfect!  I was very hungry and the server had the food out to us in no time.  

I loved the vegetable pancake so much the last time I was there, it was so incredibly good.  The curry dishes are all delicious, it is difficult to pick one.  I think that if there is one thing to complain about is that it is very hard to decide what to get because everything is absolutely amazing.

(When you go try the onion pakoras...I think that I could eat several orders of those myself because they are so good and make an awesome appetizer to share.)

Very good service and incredible food.  We look forward to going back...we'd probably go everyday if we weren't so far away!    

Thank you for making our experience at your restaurant so great.  :)"}
{"text":"I drove all for 45 mins to come check this place out, and it was closed.  There was a sign that said closed on Mondays. And yelp shows their business hours as open. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"My partner and I love Indian food, and have eaten at Indian restaurants across the USA and in Europe.  This one is special.  It's SOUTH Indian, for starts, a cuisine not as often offered in the West. The ingredients are very fresh, the recipes excellent, and the chef does not skimp on the expensive spices that give South Indian cuisine its unique flavors.  

You can tell, for example, that the spinach pakora (spinach dipped in batter and deep fried) was made using fresh rather than frozen spinach.  The staff is attentive, courteous and friendly.  We've been there four times and already we are being treated like family.  

I'm a vegan, and I ditto what Dave S. wrote: \"the staff took time to ensure that all of my selections were vegan.\"  It's not easy to find a vegan-friendly restaurant in Phoenix!  My partner and I try different dishes each time we go - there are dozens from which to choose - we've enjoyed each one.  Prices are very reasonable, especially for such beautifully prepared food.  

Another thing I notice about Ananda Bhavan is that the customers are mainly ethnic Indians.  That should tell you something about the authenticity and quality of the food! How we found out about this little jewel was by asking the owner of the Indo-European Market (the local East Indian grocery, DVD rental and dry goods store), where SHE goes to eat out."}
{"text":"Terrible service. They keep sitting guests without paying attention to time and their needs. every table around us had to get up and ask for service. Apparently food is good. We ended up just ordering appetizers so we could have our food faster. Not sure we will come back. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Very very good place for ppl who like vegetarian!! Rava dosa and sambar are my favourates..

Lunch will be served along with dosa which eveyone should definitely try:)

Lunches are always awesome with so many vwg varieties and dosa is included in lunch."}
{"text":"We went here at the beginning of March, so this review is LONG overdue! First off, I am far from a vegetarian and I have only had Indian food a couple of times. So was definitely skeptical when we decided to try this place. Dave told the server that we were unfamiliar with the names of the dishes and we asked him to pick out 3 entrees for us. He was EXCELLENT! Even though he had a heavy accent, he explained things to us and we told him what we liked and didn't like. His service was outstanding, attentive and we liked all of his suggestions. And of course, the food was excellent. Freshly prepared and very flavorful. I originally saved the receipt to tell everyone what to get, but I am so long overdue in writing this review the receipt was lost. :-( 

Vegetarian or not, I recommend you try this place out. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Bought a Groupon deal for this restaurant.  Being a vegetarian, was very impressed with the selection of dishes.  My husband, though not a vegetarian, was also very impressed with the menu.   We shared a \"starter\" - after much indecision we settled for the Vegetable cutlet - two good size cutlets, which I could have had both as a main meal, they were so good.   For our main dish, my husband had the Veg Biryani, and I had Onion Rava Masala dosai - something I have never had before.  Absolutely delicious, and very good portions, so much so that we both took half home for lunch the next day.     Can't wait to go back and try other tasty dishes.   Close to home so very convenient.     I often have difficulty finding good vegetarian food - we are not into fast food, so seldom eat out.    
The service was good, as was the suggestions for dishes.    Very clean indeed.
Did not get any \"free\" samples though, as mentioned in some of the Yelp reviews, perhaps because we had a Groupon !!   But good value for money."}
{"text":"Went for lunch buffet during the week, the restaurant was quite empty and remained empty thru lunch hour. Food was okay, the rassum was excellent but rest of the food was pretty much just okay. The buffet menu is v sparse, perhaps the weekend buffet has a better selection. $8.99 seemed a bit steep considering the selection and the taste."}
{"text":"I am so happy they opened in North Phoenix, closer to my home! They recently opened about 1.5 years ago and the food is amazing. 

I recommend the Gobi Manchurin! I get it ALL THE TIME! The curries are good too. The Indian spices are so yummy and flavorful too. 

I have to mention that I am \"VEGAN\", because some dishes have milk or dairy. So, they customize it for me a little, which is nice. 

The only small thing I would say is that there is a server that never smiles and hard to approach.  The flip side is that there is another server that is super nice and we always hope he will be our server. 

Another small thing that bothers me is that all their appetizers are deep-fried, so I usually don't get them. I wish they had some more fresh choices. 

The pricing is pretty good too. I highly recommend this location if you are looking for tasty traditional Indian Food. I am a fan and will be going again."}
{"text":"Nothing at all negative to say about this place.  Overall experience to include service/food was amazing. The all vegetarian concept is unique and was great tasting / very flavorful.  I would highly recommend this place to anyone to include all carnivores."}
{"text":"Best Indian restaurant I have ever eaten at! I recommend this for two, 30, 32, 34(2), and 83! This will make a great dinner for two vegetarians. Ask them to top off your food with some Ghee which is the best butter on earth lol It's clarified and actually is great for you. Hare Krishna!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place 3-4 times and every time I've had different experience with the food. They are very inconsistent when it comes to the quality and taste of their food. However, they are very consistent in providing a very bad service. Their servers are the rudest I've ever encountered anywhere. The whole place just has 3 servers and maybe it is the work load that's affecting their behavior. I just returned home after having dinner there and I had a really frustrating experience. They don't have a host/hostess and I had to wait for like 10 minutes in the doorway before a server noticed me and found a table for me. I ordered a combo platter with Dosa, Uttapam, vada and idli. I wanted a refill on sambhar and asked a server for it. I waited for like 20 minutes easily and nobody came to serve me. I waived another server a couple of times, he would look at me and then ignore me. My food got all cold. I then went to the server who was also acting as a cashier too and expressed my exasperation. He finally got my sambhar, but showed me attitude. I finished my food and asked for the check. Now when I was just about to leave, this server, who I waived a couple of times earlier, comes up to me and says - You need to learn to be PATIENT. He says that he had seen me waiving but chose to ignore me 'cos he was busy with other tables. I told him that all I asked for was acknowledgement of my service request. He clearly didn't understand the whole concept of service industry. I was trying to explain my point and he started to walk away. I called for him again, he turned back and approached me with anger. His coworkers tried to stop him but he tells them in HINDI - 'Let me see what he has to say' in a very rude manner. I called for his superior and he also took his side. The tone of their voice was urging me to leave and it was these guys who were creating a scene out there. This whole drama left me disgusted and frustrated. I've never encountered such unprofessional and downright rude service. I am never going back to this place again."}
{"text":"Best Indian food I have had in Phoenix. The portions are generous and the staff is kind. This is a great spot for vegetarians or anyone who likes Indian food! Haven't had anything I haven't loved."}
{"text":"Didn't know what to expect here, as my hubby and I love indian food and so are very picky - they didn't let us down. Everything was delicious and the portions were great and the service was fast and friendly. We will definitely be regulars. :-)"}
{"text":"The quality of the lunch buffet dropped drastically! The medu vadas were salty and didn't have onions or crushed green leaves. They were out of sambar and it took about half an hour for them to replace it. The naan's weren't replaced quickly either. The vanilla ice cream was semi-molten. 
The malai paneer curry was good. The gulab jamun and the custard fruit salad were up to the mark. 
Overall, disappointing for a $11.99 plus tax weekend lunch buffet."}
{"text":"We went to eat dinner here the other night....It was the WORSE service we have ever had encountered anywhere! We sat down ordered our dinner and teas and appetizer, we had a very easy order, addressed the server with Yes Sir and No Sir......They brought the food dropped it off at the end of the table for us to sort out who got what, NEVER brought us the drinks or appetizers, NEVER once come by and asked if we needed anything never gave any eye contact but yet they waited on all the other tables with complete service...the only difference in us and the other customers were we were white not Indian. If they don't want to serve \"white\" people they should let ya know before you sit down to order.  This place use to be awesome but since these new people took over I have made sure to let all of our friends know NOT to go back!
Food was very bland and very small portions compared to other Indian restaurants. We have since found Marigold Maison and India Palace......I recommend those two places highly, good food and they know how to treat their customers."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere.  Our service was ok, but could have been a little faster. The trays of food were empty, and it took them a long time to replace the food."}
{"text":"Been looking for an Indian restaurant ever since I moved to AZ and now I think I found it! Friendly staff and prices were decent. The best part--lunch buffet special 7 days a week! In LA/OC they would only offer lunch buffet specials during the week day. The cashier, Rakeesh (sp?) was so sweet and brought me a mango lassi to try since I was ordering to-go and was just waiting around. Lovely place, will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food is good, clean restaurant. I was there for dinner however the waiter only came once to my table to take my order after being seated for about 5 mins. He never came back. There is a woman there that is doing all the work for the waiters. She came to bring water twice, served the food and checked on us to see how we were. I regret that I did not get her name but she seemed to be working her tail off while the waiters all hung out at the register. We did not even get a check brought to us, we had to get up and go to the register to pay."}
{"text":"Very tasty 'south indian' food like dosa, vada, idly etc. I go often when looking for a filling n quick meal to this restaurant! This place is not like the usual Indian cuisine restaurants because south indian food is much different than the rest. 
 
Well, I hear people getting disappointed with their service and will not totally disagree. This place got operational very recently and the staff is kind of learning on the go. I have personally never had issues with their service, though. 

The good: awesome 'south indian' food, thats what this place is for, I won't order north indian dishes here. Although their sunday buffet that comprises both is pretty good. 

Reasonably priced, great variety of dosa, mysore masala is very nice, very clean place and polite staff. 

The average: service, desserts ain't tasty (have tried almost all). Also, they stick to their menu so wanting to customise too much(like creating combos, increase two vada to 3 pieces) is not gonna happen n then people complain, better to not ask for such variations. 

Go here to enjoy their specialty cuisine, good flavorful food; not for a lavish service or party type peppy ambience."}
{"text":"What's not to like about scrumptious vegetarian Indian food?  A well-stocked and clean buffet and an Indian to White-boy ratio of about 10:1.  I eat here about once every two weeks.  I like the food so much that I always eat too much and feel the post Indian food bloat afterwards.  Maybe it's the chilies, maybe it's the carbs, I don't care just be forewarned about exercising some self restraint and only go back the buffet twice at most."}
{"text":"This place has been teasing us for awhile now. Every time we go to the 24 Hour Fitness in the same plaze the smell of yummy Indian food wafts over to us and tempts us to either forgo our workouts entirely when we park or completely cancel it out when we walk out of the gym. Last night we decided to treat ourselves for dinner and made our way here since we've been craving Indian food for quite some time - we have yet to find our spot for this type of cuisine in our area. And we will probably still be hunting...

This place is not bad by any means. It is spacious and clean with lots of tables. Service is decent - not the quickest but not unforgiveable. The variety of menu items is great and their saag paneer is some of the best I've ever had. Their garlic naan is pretty darn good too. I only wish that an order comes with a little more bread for the price. Overall, tasty food at decent prices. 

The only downsides for us is that it's completely vegetarian so if we're craving chicken masala that goes unsatisfied. Thus the reason for our continued search for our one top spot for Indian cuisine. Not to say I won't be visiting this place again... I can totally see myself stopping in after a workout and picking up some naan bread and saag paneer to go. Now that's something to look forward to while on the treadmill!"}
{"text":"Terrible food. The service was awful, the ownership and staff lied to us and are completely unethical. 

Walked in for a buffet and most of the dishes were finished. We asked if they were still serving and would be  refilling the buffet. The server and owner assured us that they would. After serving us a couple dosas (cold and unappealing) we were then told that there was no more food. 

Pretty unfair to do this in the middle of your meal. Anyways the owner asked us to bear with them as they had a larger lunch crowd than expected and that they would make it up to us in the bill. So after eating a cold, half filled buffet of terrible food we were given $5 off a $55+ bill. Seems like the management is all about great service. :)

I would never go back."}
{"text":"Went there for buffet on Thursday afternoon while inviting 3 friends with me to try the indian food, called the restaurant before coming and was told that their buffet is till 3pm. After reaching and seated down at 2:20pm, our party of four sat down with the server leaving 2 water bottles on the table and walked away. There were only 2 glasses on the table. Upon looking at the buffet, 85% of menu items were almost empty. We had to tell the server to bring more food. After adding may be one bowl worth of food in the containers, clearly they were throwing in whatever was left, we sat down to eat since I had people with me waiting as well for their meal. Food was surprisingly pretty good except some dessert items, that were burnt being in the hot container for too long and being so little amount. During our meal, the server only came once when we had to ask him for fresh Naan, he didn't bother to provide 2 more glasses, obviously there were four people eating. Instead we saw him standing on the other side of the door, on his phone. So i decided to grab 2 more glasses from the table next to me. We had to call him again to bring more water. I felt horrible bringing my friends to this restaurant where service is so horrible and customers feel ignored. I will not be spending another dollar in this place. Before leaving, I made sure to complain to the server regarding their service and lack of food. His excuse was that the buffet is supposed to be till 2:30 pm and he forgot to tell me on the phone. And also that his cook is gone. What a horrible service!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. This was my second time there.   The food is very good, reasonably priced and very authentic.    Waiter very nice and helpful.  Very clean and presentation is nice.   Both times I went it wasn't busy.   They also do take out.   No complaints.    The only thing I was leery about is when you go in all the tables have filled water pitchers. You have no way of knowing how long it sat with no cover.  But that wouldn't stop me  from going back.    Great nan ( bread ).  Will go back"}
{"text":"We stopped by Madras Ananda Bhavan about a month ago when we were at the Harbor Freight Tools in the same shopping center craving something for lunch. We were pretty close to home but as we neared the parking exit on the 32nd Street side of the shopping center, we eyed this restaurant. We decided to pull over and check it out. There was a lunch buffet going on but neither of us were that hungry.  They were not serving off of the menu but we asked if we could just get an order of samosas to go. The manager told us he would check with the chef and when he came back he said they could do it no problem. We thought this was nice and it convinced us to come back for dinner that following weekend. 

I think it was a Saturday around 6ish. When we arrived, there were about 2 or 3 other groups of people, predominately Indian (a good sign) already enjoying their meal. As we sat down, we were greeted by the manager and another host. Both were friendly and recognized us from earlier in the week. The place smelled amazing and I couldn't wait to order. 

We noticed that the restaurant began to fill up and before we knew it, the entire right hand side of the restaurant was full of families coming in for a traditional, south Indian meal.

We ordered Samosas, Aloo Mutter, Saag Paneer, Dal Makhni and naan. Our samosas were flavorful and served with both tamarind and mint chutneys. Our entrees were served shortly there after and were excellent. There were a few more \"pods\" (cardamom, cumin) than I prefer but I know that it adds to the flavor, so I was more careful to look before each bite and pick out some of the chili's and seed pods before I took a bite. All in all, everything was absolutely delicious!

Oh! Madras is all vegetarian and alcohol free, so no cocktails or meaty bits here. We didn't let that dissuade us and honestly, the food here is so flavorful, you don't even miss it. Needless to say, we did stop off for a bottle of Pinot on the way home and enjoyed the rest of our evening in. 

Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"The buffet was good. The gulab jamun was really soft and there was also ice cream in the buffet."}
{"text":"I love this place, and I am not vegetarian.  The first thing I tried was the paneer butter masala.  Amazing!  the dosai crepes are also SUPER amazing.  the place is clean, and modern and the staff is very friendly!   the naan is sooooooo good!  I really recommend this place to Indian food lovers!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite South Indian place, and I drive from downtown to eat here at least a few times a month. You can tell a good ethnic restaurant when it is full of those that know the food the best: the natives/expats -- check. A couple of recommendations to bring that extra star. First, identify vegan options on the menu. Next, be friendlier. One of 2 guys will typically be our server, the smaller guy is much more welcoming and helpful, the other never smiles. And a combination of the previous mentioned opportunities, learn the menu and know which items have dairy and steer the customers more carefully. Naan has dairy, don't serve that to vegans."}
{"text":"The food here is great and this is a staple restraint when me and my wife visit Phoenix . The south Indian food is yummy. They have some consistency unissued with the salt but overall great food every time."}
{"text":"I had the lunch buffet here the other day. The service was a little slow but everyone I asked about the food was really friendly.  Since they specialize in vegetarian Indian food there was a lot I'd never tried before and it was all amazing. I will definitely be back. They're only open for lunch until 2:30 I think so go early."}
{"text":"stumbled on this place on our way to another restaurant.  it's an all vegetarian Indian food restaurant. it was a wednesday night and they were pretty busy. we were the only whiteys in the place - everyone else was Indian, a good sign.   it took a while for the food to come out but when it did it was very good.  even my husband, the anti-vegetarian, was won over by the deliciousness.  when we were leaving I spoke briefly with the owner, he told me they had just opened and were still working out the kinks.  I recommend the \"bullet naan,\" it has fresh garlic and chillies."}
{"text":"Taste of food is ok, service is also ok except that all food ordered comes out of kitchen together including the apitisers user and coffee tastes bad."}
{"text":"Who knows? Maybe we caught them on a bad day. Or maybe on their worst day. 

Service: Host/server/cashier greeted us and told us to sit wherever we wanted. He then proceeded to sit at a table with (presumably) his friends and focus on his phone for the duration of our entire meal. He finally brought us a warmer-than-room-temperature bottle of water when we were finished with everything. 

Food: Nothing noteworthy or memorable. 3 soups and a dal dish that had the consistency of a soup, corn masala, a paneer dish, rice, a few desserts for good measure and boom! you have a $10.50 buffet ticket. 

This was my second visit. The first was a takeout order -- also not very memorable, but decent. 

I don't think I'll be going back."}
{"text":"Having a tough time giving one star today. With change of management and chef the food quality has gone down tremendously. Paneer was oily and old and  South Indian dishes were dry and low quality. Any good home cook could turn this place around. Looks like no one is doing any quality control. Owners need to take better interest in the kitchen than leave to an inexperienced chef . 
Will not be visiting this place again."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I found this place thanks to a Groupon, otherwise we would have never known about it. I'm not a vegetarian, but the reviews on Yelp were good so I was looking forward to it. To cut to the chase, we both really liked what we had, which was quite a lot of dishes considering we had to order enough to meet our dollar value. 

I really like Indian food, but always order dishes with different meats, etc. This style, I believe is more in line with Southern India cuisine, and was quite different than what I've had before, but doesn't mean it wasn't as tasty. 

What really set the experience apart was the wait staff. We were helped out by two different waiters, each tag-teaming different tables. I really like when waiters offer their opinions on dishes instead of saying \"everything's good.\" We asked what they recommended, they gave us some options, then we asked what they eat and they gave us different choices, which we selected. 

And another good marker, we were one of a small handful of non-Indians there, which is always a good sign for a place like this. 

While I would have loved to have these dishes with little bits of tasty lamb, I still think it was very good and recommend this place highly. We'll be going back."}
{"text":"Madras Anandha Bhavan is the best place in Phoenix to get Vegetarian Indian food. Nan bread is always good almost in all Indian restaurants. I tried Chapati bread here. It a whole wheat not greasy bread which tasted soo good. I also love masala dosa, paneer dishes and aloo gobi. I also like the lunch buffet here. 

The food is good, restaurant is clean, service is good, staffs are friendly and fair priced. I will surely recommend this place to my friend."}
{"text":"Went for evening snacks time .. Dosa was good . I tried pav masala dosa.. Chole bhature wasnt worth the price and wasnt tat good"}
{"text":"As much I want to rate this place with 5 stars , I have to rate 2 as this Sunday ( feb 15) I went with my friend for his bday lunch and was very disappointed with service of lunch buffet at 1 pm . Pretty much every tray of food was empty , masala dosa was replaced by not well prepared uthapam , gulab jamuns were extremely soggy and mashed in syrup , payasam was burn and coconut chutney was way diluted ( as if they were running out of it ) . Overall it was really bad. Still giving 2 star as I have some wonderful experience with buffet here and also dinner. Some of the preparations were good but the vada were very tough and idly\"s were not sour enough, overall it was very bad buffet  for $13 and I drove all the way from central phoenix to enjoy this food. Disappointment !!!"}
{"text":"If you're into vegetarian, this is the place to be.  I've been trying to do nothing but veggie days sometimes.  This place really hit the spot.  They had an okra dish in their buffet line that I really liked.  Everything also tasted very fresh."}
{"text":"Was here on July 4 with family and was very impressed. Excellent spread, well prepared in traditional style, plenty of choice of deserts and great service. Only negative was the rush to get Dosas to our table even before we had settled down with round 1 of our buffet food, which resulted in Dosas being eaten cold. Was also told they could not do a take-out order during lunch, as I wanted to take some food for dinner later at Grand Canyon where I was headed. Overall, great stuff and feel jealous of Phoenix folks, even though Dallas where I live, has many good Indian vegetarian restaurants."}
{"text":"Being new to Phoenix area, we were searching for good South Indian food options. I think we've found it! Decor of this place is no frills - simple and clean. Madras offers a wide variety of menu options and they don't skimp on heat in their food. They do however ask you how hot you wanted it, so we told them to not hold back and we got what we wanted. 
It is vegetarian only, but I really didn't miss non-veg options because the flavors and variety were really good. We ordered Rasam (nice and spicy to start the meal with), then Veg Samosa and Rice Idly served with sides of Sambar and 2 other sauces - both were delicious, and for the main meal we ordered Aloo Mutter with Naan which was excellent. All that food for 24 bucks wasn't bad! The food wasn't oily which in my experience tends to happen with South Indian food. Although I don't have other places to compare this to (as there seems to be no other South Indian Restaurants within 15 mi radius), we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Delicious. I had the lunch buffet. The paneer butter masala and tamarind rice were awesome.  There were so many tasty vegetarian options! Yes it's vegetarian, but a  non-vegetarian would still feel they had a filling and delicious meal. I have been to a ton of indian places through out the phoenix area this is hands down one of favorites so far. The staff is also quite friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Was our first time eating Indian food. Staff was very helpful in pointing us in the right direction with the menu. Food was delicious. Will def be back next time we want some Indian food!"}
{"text":"Way remiss in writing a review on this gem in north Phoenix.  The flavors and attention to detail is what makes this place special for us.  Surprisingly NOT a vegeterian, my palate was deliciously rewarded with flavors I hadn't tasted since we dined in London this past fall.
Foodies, put this on your list to sample, and come for dinner.  Granted no alcohol, but you will be drunk on the wonderful spices and craft that this family puts into every dish they make."}
{"text":"Even if you aren't a veggie, this place is awesome!!  My new favorite Indian spot."}
{"text":"This place is delicious!! Upon entering this cute restaurant the aroma of spices makes you glad you came in. I have never tried Southern Insian food before and I was blown away!! Our waiter was really nice and helpful as well. We followed his recommendations and were completely satisfied."}
{"text":"This was a great find. The food was great, and the staff was very nice. The restaurant itself was a bit rundown, but the food definitely makes up for it. It is great that they only offer vegetarian dishes. They also offer carryout! I will definitely be a returning customer."}
{"text":"I have been coming here at least once a week for over a year and recently experienced the worst service I've ever had. Not only was the bathroom out of order but the waitress did not bring me a drop of water or a dosa. I had to seek out somebody to bring me my water. When I told the manager about my experience he did not even offer me a discount on my meal"}
{"text":"The food was even better than I remembered, and as I was leaving, I thought to myself that I need to eat here at least once a month or more.  The flavors here are just top notch, and the staff is super friendly.  One really good mark of an Indian restaurant, is that Indian people eat there.  While I saw a mix of people in the place for the buffet this afternoon, I saw a healthy number of Indians there as well which made me feel like I was eating authentic cuisine.  Put it this way, how many chinese people do you see eating at PF Changs or Panda express?  The reason is because the food is made for a western palate.  At Madras, the food is all Indian all the time, and that is what is going to keep me coming back!  A great tip is that at the end of your meal when you are walking out, they have a bowl called Mukhwas, or basically \"mouth freshener.\"  The mix is cardamom, anise seed, and coconut candy, and one half spoon full in your hand that you put into your mouth really helps to sooth your stomach after the meal. So if you haven't gone yet, use this review as an absolute billboard to try their buffet, and come back for dinner."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! It has become my new favorite Indian restaurant and I love the fact that it is vegetarian. Not my favorite palak, but the paneer butter masala (add potatoes) and the gobi manchurian are PHENOMENAL! Just had the gobi manchurian for the first time this evening and I think I'm in love. It is now my favorite dish! The only thing two things I have noticed about this place is that the rice they provide is not very flavorful or fragrant. Very plain. I also have to request for everything to be extra extra spicy because they tend to make dishes far too mild for my taste. Other than that, it is perfect!"}
{"text":"I have been walking by this place for months at least once a week on my way through the parking lot to 24 Hour Fitness.  When my parents came into town, I knew we had to go since they love Indian Food and my dad is a vegetarian.  Now I am not a huge Indian Food fan, and usually stick to appetizers, but everything I tried was delicious.  The pakora and samsoas were the best I've ever had.  And the service was amazing!  The wait staff helped cheer up my 3 year old (who was a little grumpy since she hadn't napped..too excited about the grandparents arrival).  They gave her a free mango lassi and when they heard her saying they wanted fries they brought some out  right away without us even asking or charging us!  They treated my daughter like a princess.  Four of us ordered entrees and we split three appetizers.  It was a huge amount of food for 45 dollars and my daughter tried some new things, plus we had extra to take home.  I highly recommend this restaurant for the tasty dishes, excellent value and AMAZING service!!!"}
{"text":"As a meatatarian I had a really good and hearty meal here! The price for the lunch buffet is why I gave it 4 instead of 5.. I paid $15 for the buffet with naan bread and tap water, and tax. Other than that I'm definitely coming back here!"}
{"text":"Average food. Idli was not as soft as it could be, sambhar was watery. The dosa was good but potato was a bit bland. South Indian food is hard to find in Phoenix and this was simply average. Coming from the West Valley I do t know that we would make this trek again."}
{"text":"I love this place.  We go there on the weekends to enjoy their veggie buffet.  After five times, we realized that we hadn't had the same dish twice.  The dosas are fantastic  and appropriately spicy.  It's been a while since I've been to Udapi, but this place seems better from what I recall.  No alcohol or meat, so any review referring to Chicken Tikka means they haven't been there."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Indian restaurants I've been to.  Wonderful service and the entire meal, yes the entire meal, was wonderful.  Even the kids liked it and well, you know kids, they don't like anything."}
{"text":"The more I eat here, the better it gets.  I LOVE this place.  To be clear, I do takeout about 90% of the time, so I cannot comment on the service.  However, the food is simply spectacular (especially when compared with the other Indian restaurants in N. Phoenix) and continues to get better the longer they are in business."}
{"text":"Expect no real service standards here. For example, if you order a diet coke when you come in for the lunch buffet, there's only a 50/50 shot that you'll actually get it before finishing your meal. 

The food is South Indian style, which is sorely lacking from the Indian restaurant scene in this part of the Valley. But also lacking, at this restaurant, is quality. The dosas don't seem to be freshly made. The sambar is disappointingly poor: it combines too few vegetables with too little flavor, and is not at all hearty. It's actually bland, which is a shocking sin if you're going to offer sambar at all. 

There are some positives. The place appears to be spotlessly clean, with wide open spaces and lots of tables. The vegetable Manchurian is very tasty, as is the palak paneer (a North Indian dish). If they significantly improved on their service, put more effort into a much tastier sambar, and stop serving dosas that taste like they've been sitting around for hours (I don't know that they do, but that's what they taste like), this place could be a big hit. Without at least those changes though, I don't see this place lasting in the long run."}
{"text":"Apparently this restaurant has been open for years, and I just now became aware of it.

Boy, am I sure glad I am!

The food sure is a delight to feast upon!

I love that it's all vegetarian. And it's fun for me that it's South Indian, because I'm more familiar with North Indian. 

Favorites on the buffet today for me are the masala paneer, tomato rice dish, lentil daal, raita, the dosas served at each table, the paper-thin \"crunchy circles\" whose name escapes me (though I'm not sure it was really ever \"captured\" by me!), the mango fruit salad, eggplant dish - and chai, on the buffet just the way I love it!

I read some reviews commenting on the bottles of water at each table. To me it may not seem as classy as a nice pitcher of water, with ice. Although, in Phoenix, knowing the water tastes just fine is a bonus.

The service was attentive, to me. Although I've seen comments from others suggesting that was not the same for them. 

Patrons may sit wherever they want. I just happened to sit in the half of the restaurant well-traveled by staff. I was between a curtain-covered door, and the kitchen door. That might be the secret to friendly attention; although I did not notice the level of service people on the other side of the middle divider received.

I received warm and friendly service. In fact, I was pleased when the hostess/server offered me a second dosa. She seemed appreciative when I complimented her/them on how great everything is.

This is very exciting for me, because I feel I've discovered another excellent Indian buffet near the places I usually frequent. That makes three near North Scottsdale, and one on the West Side.

So I'm loving it!

The only thing that wasn't great was the atmosphere itself. The floor I walked on was sticky. I noticed on the other side of the half I was dining at, the tables had a glass pane over the table cloth. My table at least did not. It was kind of dingy; not elegant, certainly.

That's not a drawback for me. I choose a place based on the food, first, and secondly on the service. Anything else is \"gravy\". So no worries for me.

This place is now near the top of my \"Best Indian Buffet\" list!"}
{"text":"The food was great friendly and the staff was super friendly!  I took my friend to eat Indian food for the first time and she loved it. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"5 stars all the way for this restaurant. I usually go to this place once in a month and I order different things. I havent been disappointed yet. The weekend lunch buffet is insane and very very tasty. Food is awesome and the service is awesome as well. My only gripe is the AC..its too damn cold. Will definitely return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place offers the best south Indian fare in the Phoenix area, hands down. If you're not familiar with south vs. north Indian cuisine, make a beeline for this place, preferably for a lunch buffet where you can sample lots of different offerings. We come again and again for their idlies, vadai, dosa, uthappams and sambar. They are accommodating and have no trouble making dahi vadai for my younger daughter (it's her favorite) even if it's not on the menu. The owners are from Mumbai so they also do chaat very well. It's very family friendly and you will see loads of multigenerational Indian families if you go for lunch buffet or an early dinner. The place is clean, the portions are enormous, and the prices are reasonable. What more could you want in an Indian restaurant? Yum!"}
{"text":"Going in we know that we go for the food, and expect generally poor service. But this last Fridays experience was more than we could handle... 

Apparently the server swapped my wife's dosa with someone elses. She didn't realize it and had started eating it.. 10 min later the manager looking guy came in with another plate told us that the dosa was swapped, was sorry about that... all good so far but then he just grabed the plate she was eating off, mid fork... no \"would you like me to to remove it\", no sir... Put the new plate in front of her dumped the food that he grabbed from her into the waste collection bin that was sitting next to him and walked away. 

We felt really awful after that experience, we couldn't finish our meal after that, we paid the bill and walked out. Sigh... we are shameless, might still end up going there after the trauma wears off.. food is still decent."}
{"text":"The food is average comparatively. South Indian dishes are good, but the North dishes are not up to the mark. Friendly staff and decent place to visit."}
{"text":"Great vegetarian buffet! Very fresh, and all veggie so you don't have to worry about accidentally getting lamb from the buffet table. Dosas are included, and they were very tasty with coconut chutney to dip in. I really liked that they had okra too, I've never seen that at a buffet. The waiters were very friendly and brought my daughter a small mango lassi for free. They are only getting 4 stars because it was a little expensive for a lunch menu, especially when it's all veggie."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. I have been there for lunch buffet (lots of choices, even for vegan!) and for dinner. Very generous portions, tastes great, and nice folks."}
{"text":"This was our first time here, but Indian food is not new to us. We ordered a dosai, which was huge, and samosas, which were excellent, and aloo gobi with naan. The food was awesome, the dipping sauces were so good as well; and the staff was extremely attentive but not overly so. I had a mango lassi to drink and my boyfriend had a hot chai.  Again, everything was wonderful and we will be back."}
{"text":"Uhh... 13.42 for a vegetarian buffet  on a weekday for lunch...with like 4 basic entrees to choose from? The food was ok but basic and bland.place was empty, should have taken that as a hint."}
{"text":"Excellent authentic South Indian food, both for Indians and non-Indians.

It has a good list of North Indian food as well for those who want it, but obviously South Indian food is their specialty!

The restaurant is clean and people are courteous. One common thing I see though is that the staff is slow to respond. I have ended up waiting for around 10 minutes before my order was taken (after I was seated) . I have faced the same problem when I asked for the check as well. However, the food was delivered pretty soon after we ordered it.

Food portions are plenty and it is good value for money, especially the afternoon lunch buffet.

Overall, I would say that this place is excellent and i would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to try authentic South Indian vegetarian food!"}
{"text":"In short : Its South Indian Vegetarian Restaurant. The only one in its surroundings. For First timers (or) those who are longing for South Indian Vegs : Right Place.
But its no where near to HIgh Class Veg Restaurants in South India.

Lunch Buffet : I often go on Saturdays. They have many varieties. Vada is really good. My fav. is Gobi Manchuria (but sometimes they dont serve it). My advice, dont order any drinks during Buffet hours (They may not even show up). They serve mini masala dosa as a part of buffet (dont forget to ask for it). The Naan is mostly little hard or burnt(its buffet, so try other options ). Mostly they have a 'Makhani' dish. Its sweet and delicious. Its south Indian, so try pulao or white rice with sides. Carrot Halwa is really good.The crowd during weekends is too much sometimes and do not expect any prompt service.

A la Catre : Tiffins are Excellent. My fav. is Puri. Chat items are really good in taste and presentation. I've had better Veg Biryani(s). 
Staff is not very prompt. The service is very(some times very very) delayed."}
{"text":"Okayyy so I went back for dinner. Couldn't resist when I saw the half off Groupon! This time, I chose the \"regular\" masala dosa and it was good. Now the main reason I had to come back to write this review was this incident. After dinner, we - a party of four - decided to taste the Gulab Jamun. Now you get 3 pieces in an order, however our server voluntarily brought us four (one free!!) because we were a party of four. That was such a nice gesture! Now, this does not change my opinion about the Kara Dosa (OMG! no!) but I did have a better experience service-wise."}
{"text":"Really yummy, I've never had an Indian buffet this good. Even my mom liked this place! Tasted fresh and more upscale than most Indian buffets."}
{"text":"Went to this place with high expectations as we got to taste some good food on our previous visit . This time we ordered veg briyani, the rice was too dry and didn't taste fresh, then we odered rava onion masala dosa , dosa itself was good but sambar tasted odd , so we called up the waitress and asked . we were surprised to hear her say that no one else has complained.after this incident we decided not to come here again."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time. We went for the lunch buffet. Food was good, service was good. Would not be my \"go to\" place but enjoyable. I do feel it was a bit over priced for a lunch buffet."}
{"text":"I wasn't a fan of Indian food until a large group of friends took me here.
I was very impressed with the service. We were indecisive and didn't have any clue what to order, so we asked our waiter to bring us 7 dishes for us to split 7 ways. He brought us 7 varying dishes, most of which I really really enjoyed. We were also given free small cups of mango lassi, free naan, and free dessert. He then asked us if we had ever been to India, and when we said no, gave us a brief history lesson. It was an absolutely wonderful experience!
To top it off, the staff was very accommodating and split the total sum evenly between all 7 of our checks, and the total came to something small like $8 a person for more food than we could all consume. They were so gracious and so generous in feeding us all.
I've already returned with  my mother, and I'm definitely going to return for the weekday lunch buffet."}
{"text":"I had the lunch buffet. Best sambar I've ever had anywhere, including India. The serve yourself masala tea is perfect. No sugar so you can sweeten to your own taste, and perfectly spiced with masala. I love that they don't sugar it because I have my own birch sugar, which has the consistency and taste of sugar but is not run through animal bone ash like regular sugar, so I can adhere to my vegetarian ethics.

The potato masala, which I smothered with the dal Tarka, was so good I had to test each individually to see which tasted better.  A dead tie--equally delicious.
The coconut chutney was subtle, & mixed with a little curd rice, I found it the perfect complement to the dosa. I went back to the buffet for a few extra mushroom 65 for an excuse to get some more chutney! I tried the curd rice & the chutney individually also, and while they were both excellent, it wasn't until their flavors mingled that an ecstatic explosion happened across my taste buds.

Living in Houston, with its plethora of excellent Indian vegetarian restaurants serving our large south Asian population, I am more than a little spoiled by the variety and have come to appreciate and recognize excellence when I taste it. If this restaurant were in Houston, the owners would become wealthy very quickly, while setting a new standard in a town already known and appreciated for its fantastic variety and quality of Indian fare."}
{"text":"Went there the other day for the lunch buffet, and the memories of my three week work trip to Bangalore came flashing back.  The idli and sambar, the dosa masalas, all the various curries I ate in the company cafeteria (good ol' Mother Earth) came flashing back into my memory.  Was that a bad thing?? All that vegetarian food for a happy carnivore??  No way!!!  I may have had a bit of culture shock during my stay in Karnataka, but the food was not part of the \"shock\".  The food is authentic South Indian, and quite tasty.  If you go, and I do recommend going, do get your share of dosas during your visit."}
{"text":"Delicious food had the paneer masala everything tasted great service was a bit slow but we will return here again."}
{"text":"As far as Indian Food goes, you can't beat this place. Amazing naan, very fruitful tastes in each curry dish, excellent service and very clean decor inside."}
{"text":"Really very good!!

I am actually non-vegetarian guy, but I was really delighted by quality, taste and ambience. I would highly recommend this restaurant especially to vegetarian guys.

Cheers!!"}
{"text":"We went for the lunch buffet. About $12 pp
Service: Very good, we were welcomed immidiately and seated. Our needs were looked into well.
Ambience: Good, decent, clean, spacious, with a music in the background
Food quality: Ok, the ingredients were fresh
Taste: Meh, not so much. Taste was not that great. It was just so so
Variety: Good, good selection
Price: Ok, $12 seemed like a lot considering that the food taste was not great

We could not have much food. It was a bit fatty and found raw garlic in quite a few dishes including a soup. But of they take care of these, I think there is definitely promise."}
{"text":"Someone pinch me, I think I may be dreaming...

Delicious vegetarian Indian food at a decent price only a quarter mile away from my house???

I can't believe this place has been around for a few months and I never noticed it! Almost perfect, a 4.5 star rating which I will round up because I think it may be the best Indian food in the Phoenix area.

The atmosphere is nothing special. Clean and simple. 

Service was good. Attentive and informative. Owner came and talked with us during our meal to welcome us to his restaurant.

We had the palak paneer, one of the crepe things (forgot what its called) filled with potatoes and cheese, and garlic naan.

Everything was delicious and bursting with flavor! Even my carnivore husband was smitten. Our eyes were practically rolling to the backs of our heads. 

My only very minor complaints... serving size of the naan could be a little bigger. They only had one combination dinner but it didn't have a curry in the choices. And being the alcoholic vegetarian I am, I really wish they had a liquor license so I could wash down all this delicious food with a Taj Mahal. 

Otherwise, excellent. I don't know what the bad reviewers were thinking...

Can't wait to try their lunch buffet!"}
{"text":"I like their lunch buffet. I'm not a vegetarian but I'm a big fan of veggie Indian food. It's a great selection. They don't just bring out the typical naan you'd see at a buffet, but something lighter, bigger, it looked like a cone. It was super tasty."}
{"text":"Though the food was not authentic Indian but was still quite delicious. The dosas were good. Somehow did not feel the same for the chats. Overall \"Not Bad\".

Con : - Service was not upto standard. We went there in a large group .It was visible that they were not able to handle a large group."}
{"text":"Used to love this place, but no more. Went there today for lunch: different people seem to run it now, and the food was different and just bad. Prices have gone up, too."}
{"text":"I'm not usually a huge Southern Indian food fan (I prefer the Northern fare), but my mum has taken me to pretty much every Indian restaurant in the greater Phoenix area and she wanted to try this one, so my brother and I tagged along (who says no to free Indian food? Who?). Food was awesome! Mum started off with the Mulligatawny soup, which was very spicy but really good, and my brother and I just ordered an extra side of bread (we always go with traditional garlic naan and we ordered an aloo peas paratha as well, which was very good). Mum had a dosai, which she is really fond of, for the life of me I cannot remember what my brother ordered, and I had the aloo mutter, which was fantastic. Our waiter was very nice and very helpful - a little too helpful, as he asked about the spice level we'd like (I said very low, as I know how spicy some places can get) and when Mum said an 8 out of 10 he replied, \"No, for you, a 3.\" He was mostly joking but she was insisting she wanted it very hot and he kept trying to navigate her down. He probably saw her as a delusional white woman who would start crying the second she started eating and realized how hot it really was, but lived in India and ate nothing but Indian food in London in college, so she (unlike my pathetic palette) can handle some CRAZY spicy food, and he eventually gave up trying to change her mind. We had a really great dinner, and it was nice to see that they actually have a lot of Indian customers, which usually points to some authentic and delicious food. Will definitely be back, this place changed my mind about Southern Indian cuisine!"}
{"text":"Service is friendly and attentive.  Food tastes pretty fresh, but the menu is very heavy on the fried items.  I left feeling like a grease pit."}
{"text":"In my struggle to find decent Indian food in the north valley, this place is the best up here. Trust, I have tried many. The flavor profile is right. Service is pretty good and it's all vegetarian. I usually get the mutter pander, this is my favorite dish. It's delicious here. Also love their gulag jamun. Yum yum. The servings are great and I always have enough for leftovers."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time a few days ago.  After reading the Yelp reviews, I settled in for a long wait, but was pleasantly surprised when there was none.

The servers were prompt, pleasant, and informative, the menu extensive, the prices reasonable and the food delicious, however, it seems almost criminal not to offer cold beer with hot/spicy Indian food. It was definitely missed.

The facility itself is stark and no-frills.  Maybe they consider beer a frill."}
{"text":"Best Indian cuisine in Phoenix - Hubert is a great host, funny and kind. I gotta say it though - Rakesh is missed! Hope to see him around."}
{"text":"It is rare to find an Indian restaurant that caters only to vegetarians and equally rare to find one that serves authentic Indian food. But Madras Ananda Bhavan is one such restaurant that beats both the odds and continues to impress with quality of service and value. I've been to this place a couple of times and usually end up ordering one of the Dosas since they are really good. I've tried a one or two of their curry entrees and they didn't match my expectations, but again I'm from south India and about 90% of the curry entrees on the menu are from North India. So, I'll suspend my judgment on them. But otherwise this is a decent Indian restaurant that most of the things right. Can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Their coconut 'pancake' was MIND BLOWING. My mom and I devoured it. Everything else was super tasty too. Good prices, quick service and outstanding, authentic Southern Indian cuisine. Will go again when I'm on this side of town."}
{"text":"Very surprising that I would like Indian food without meats! I had to be in the area for classes and there wasn't a lot of choices in the area.  A co-worker had gone to the buffet before so I decided to join him for lunch.  The staff was friendly and the restaurant was clean.  

The buffet included salad, soups, two types of rice, and other dishes which I have no clue what I had but it was all good!  Lots of spices and a variation of veggies in the dishes, anyone would enjoy! We there two days in a row and the buffet had different dishes each time.  The price was reasonable and I never left hungry.  

I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to try something different and enjoy some great Indian dishes one may not have tried unless they went to Madas Ananda Bhavan."}
{"text":"We use this place quite a lot simply because the food is so delicious. Every dish we have had from here (and most of our meals are takeaway)  has been so tasty. We were vegetarians for many years and we are happy to find somewhere like this were we can indulge on our veggie preferences. 
The only recommendations are these - make the name more recognizable and easy to remember ( we have often found it hard to find on yelp and google because it is difficult to remember), and consider an alcohol license as this food goes down well with a good Kingfisher or other cold lager. But overall, we have yet to have a bad meal from this place."}
{"text":"Excellent. Easy to use Groupon. Very tasty vegetarian Indian food, even for beginners.

Had the coconut pancake, the veggie pancakes, a curry and the cottage cheese.  I asked for the curry extremely spicy, but it wasn't.  Typical.  But still very tasty.  Naan is a MUST.

Lots of Indians in here, including some who were doing tastings for a catered event.  This is the real deal.  We will be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I were like two little lost puppies when we came in here. We had no clue what to order, what anything would taste like, etc. We needed some serious help. And the server did a phenomenal job of helping coach us through the menu! I got the beingan bartha at his suggestion, which is smoked eggplant cooked with onions and peppers and was absolutely delicious. The rice it comes with is also seasoned in something, which was great. My husband ordered the Masala Dosai which came with two dips (one tomato, one coconut) on the side. We ordered a mini dosai for my son. So, okay, my son is 13 months old and we fed him everything we ordered, and he loved it. That's telling you how good it all was. Also we ordered the garlic naan which I thought could have been a bit more garlicky, but that's the only nitpicky thing I can think of. Otherwise the food and service were both fantastic!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Apparently, most Indian restaurants serve Northern Indian cuisine. This restaurant is Southern Indian and all vegetarian....which means a large menu of tasty foods you've probably not had before. One major difference is the inclusion of crepes wrapped around your main dish. Yum! 

They are friendly, staff will chat with you, dinner portions are huge and served quickly. 

We went early in the evening on a week day...there were only a few other tables filled, but it usually appears to be packed for the lunch buffets. Can't wait to go back and try it!  

For those who are fans of Indian food...those who are adventurous with their eating....and those who up for trying something new...this is a MUST."}
{"text":"I had no clue what I was doing when I went to this restaurant!  I've only eaten Indian food a few times and this is Southern Indian food.  It is also vegetarian which is fine with me as I tend to not eat a lot of meat.

First off:  This place is clean!  I mean this place is spotless.  You seriously could probably eat off of the floor.  Wouldn't but could.  Also I think the staff is cute!  All these amazing men running around from table to table.  I had a groupon and you have to tell them upon entering (and the sign on the door will remind you!) but I don't think they treated me any differently due to that.  I think they did kinda laugh at us behind our backs because my 12 yr. old daughter and I had NO clue what the heck we were ordering and we wound up with plate after plate of food!  

There was seriously enough for an army and the whole thing came to about $40!  So I don't understand other people saying it's kinda pricey.  I think it's a great deal!  I loved the Onion Pakora.  I am gluten free and haven't been able to have onion rings often due to this.  Well, The Onion Pakora is a nice altenative.  I did like the tamarind sauce served with it but I took some home and they were even MORE amazing with my own Roasted red bell pepper garlic aoli!

We also had Sambar Vidai, which is a lentil dumpling kind of with a stew type sauce.    It was good!  We also got Paneer Pakora (Fried cheese) which neither of us cared for.  Then a Cheese Masala Dosai, which honestly we took home and I fed my daughter for lunch the following day as she LOVED the Masala.  We also took home a coconut Uthappan, which neither of us cared for.  

My daughter loved the Batata Vada deep fried potato balls covered in chickpea flour.  It was actually a bit spicy for me but she ate them up!  Yeah, I said we ordered way too much food for the two of us.  We actually ate a few more meals out of the left overs...and the waiter was very gracious about not teasing us.  I think he was awesome!

Service was fast and great!  I think I would go back and just get onion pakora and an order of Sambar Vadai and call it way more than enough!  If you are ready to try something new I suggest giving them a try!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Atmosphere was god for the family. If you love vegetarian food, this is a good place."}
{"text":"Alright my two stars is not about the food! Food rating would be a 3 because we were half way impressed.

We got inside and immediately sat down assuming it was a buffet because according to the homepage of their website it is a buffet style, yet if you don't research enough you find out that its only buffet during lunch. We decided to give it a shot even though we were expecting buffet. The vegetable curry was good but there was barely any rice with the dish. The garlic naan had so much garlic my stomach hurt a little as I kept eating it. We also got the cheese crepe dish and we just didn't like the flavor much. 

I also decided to adventure out on a sweet lassi which as the waiter explained is like a smoothie with yogurt and sugar mixed. Wrong! It is a yogurt drink with a pinch of sugar. It is like drinking a bitter yogurt drink and I wouldn't recommend. I didn't hate it but I love thai iced teas and it was an extreme sweet jump in my preference on a sugar scale. 

Lastly the menus! Ugh there is nothing more frustrating then coming to an Indian restaurant in America where half of the dishes are explained and the others aren't explained in a comprehensive way. Most of our menus had sharpie edits with dishes and prices crossed out and rewritten. Then as we ordered our waiter informed us about all the dishes that they did not have. I am sorry it is on your menu but you don't have it? It is just poorly done and very confusing. I have had Indian before and it was not this complex. I don't think we will be back."}
{"text":"Awesome food. We had Veg Biryani, Garlic Naan with Gobi Paneer curry and Bhel poori. All dishes were awesome. We loved it. Veg biryani was so yummy. It melted in our mouth. It was cooked well and perfectly made. Worth spending!!!"}
{"text":"Very frequent visitor to this restaurant. ..Nice service and staff. Food is also good. But sometimes they disappoint ... last time I tried Veg Uttapam which I must say was half cooked, they replaced it though but second time also it was not up to the mark... Dosa is much better and is a good option.."}
{"text":"My Indian co-workers and friends swore by this place, and it really is pretty good. 

I should educate myself on the varieties of food served, but the things that resembled crepes were really good. And that stuff that looks like spinach. Oh, and the spicy potatoes. It was a very filling and delicious lunch!

Anyway, between this and Udupi Cafe (don't let my ignorance of the names of the cuisine convince you that I don't know what I like. I just don't know what to call it), I think Udupi serves up the hotter and spicier entrees, while this one served dishes I hadn't experienced before.

I'd return, and next time will probably take notes. Or pictures. Or something."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time recently, with a carnivore, but we both truly enjoyed the buffet, which was vegetarian. The selection was good and the food was very tasty. The Dosas were really fabulous and I really liked the tea! There was a lentil dish I really enjoyed, I don't recall what it was called (I'm new to Indian cuisine.) I am looking forward to going again."}
{"text":"We were actually trying to find a different new Indian place and came upon this one.  We are not vegetarians and did not realize this was a vegetarian place until we sat down and looked at the menu.  
We were pleasantly surprised.  The flavors were wonderful.  We will definitely go back to try more dishes."}
{"text":"I'm giving this 5 stars because it is t the best Indian food in the North Phoenix/Scottsdale area that we've found  We've eaten Indian in Australia, East Asia, Europe and North America, and this is probably the best South Indian restaurant we've found outside of Little India in Singapore.

Each of the dishes we tried was very fresh, unlike many restaurants that taste very good, but you can tell that the curries have been stewing for a very long time.  

We shared an order of Pani Puri as an appetizer, which came ready to assemble with the crisp, ungreasy shells and 2 kinds of dhal, cilantro/coriander, potatoes, onion and tomatoes, along with mint and tamarind sauces.   I could have eaten an entire order as a light meal and had a very happy mouth and stomach!

Next came a Masala Dosai and a Sada (plain) Dosai.  Again, the dosais were crisp and non-greasy, and the masala filling was flavorful and plentiful.  The accompanying sambar was full of veggies, and the tomato sauce and coconut-chili chutney were spicy delicious.

We also ordered the Palak Dhal Tarka (spinach and lentils with herbs) but I think we actually received the Dhal Tarka (same thing minus the spinach).  Again, very fresh flavors, with a good quantity of cumin seeds and fresh cilantro/coriander leaves on top.  There was a modest amount of rice served with it, but the server was quick to offer more if needed.  I never missed the spinach, though I'd still like to try it in the dish.

Two sweet lassi (yogurt \"milkshake\") rounded out our order, and we left quite happy with both the food and the service.  There was a very short wait between placing our order and food arriving, and staff was constantly checking to be sure we had everything we needed.  They even made sure we knew what everything was and how to eat it (in the case of the Pani Puri).

As other reviewers have stated, the restaurant is rather plain but very clean.   Clean is always good, and I don't mind the plainness.  

I look forward to returning to try the lunchtime buffet."}
{"text":"I love Indian cuisine, and being still fairly new to the valley, I'm trying to find the best places in town for Indian food.  I bought a Groupon for Madras Ananda Bhavan a few months ago and decided to go for dinner last night.

As we approached I saw a sign on their front door warning/ advising customers that if they use a Groupon gratuity will be automatically added to their bill.  I found that to be an odd and ostracizing thing to do, but at least they were upfront about it.

We arrived before 6pm and it was pretty quiet, with only a few tables present. Nice. I enjoy quiet dining.  The sign said to wait to be seated. We only had to wait a few seconds before we were seated and the menus were brought. I informed them right away that I'd be using a Groupon.  I advised the waiter that I was vegan and inquired about the menu items in which I was interested. He was knowledgeable, helpful, and very friendly (awesome smiles!).

We ordered vegetable samosas ($3.50). They were huge and very good. Crunchy & golden on the outside; savory and spicy on the inside. Their tamarind sauce is stronger and more tart than to what I am accustomed, but it was ok.  I prefer the sweeter based tamarind sauces though. 

I ordered the Gobi Manchurian ($8.99). It was absolutely AMAZING! The cauliflower was so perfectly crisp and that red sauce (not spicy) is so flavorful. Outstanding vegan dish!

I ordered plain puri/poori ($2.99 for 2 pieces), which is a light vegan bread.  Plain puri/poori is not on the menu (the menu offers stuffed puris), but just ask for it. It was very good. 

My dinner mate ordered naan ($2), and the server advised me not to eat it because it contains dairy.  (Good looking out!) She thought her naan was a little too burnt for her liking. 


Here's where things go badly...

My non-vegan dinner mate wanted Aloo Saag, which is not on the menu.  The waiter advised that she could order Saag Paneer ($10.99) and add aloo (potatoes), so that's what she did.  (Note to vegan's who are not familiar with Indian cuisine: saag = spinach, & paneer = cheese, so this is not a vegan dish.  If you'd like a spinach dish, inquire about them making a vegan version, like Aloo Saag with no dairy.) She really enjoyed her dish until.... she noticed a long piece of hair in her spoonful of saag.  Process of elimination: she has very long, naturally curly/wavy hair, so it was definitely not her own hair.  I was sitting across the table and never came near her food, but for s&g let's just add that I have extremely curly hair, so it most certainly was not my hair. I examined it closely to ensure that it wasn't an herb of some sort, but it was indeed a hair follicle.  Despite my OCD-ness screaming on the inside, I was very calm and maintained a smile as I called over the owner and pointed out the snafu. He apologized profusely, promptly took away the tainted food, and brought her a new dish with new naan.

Our dishes were served with a small helping of rice. What is up with the instant white rice?? You get @ 2 spoonfuls of this plain and dry rice. Where is the moist, fluffy, herb-infused, flavor-bursting basmati rice?  Very disappointing!

Pitchers of water were sitting on each table, even the unoccupied ones. Having a pitcher of water at your table is definitely a plus for me because I drink a lot of water.  However, with that pesky nat (it drove me crazy!) and any other germs flying around, I did not like that the water had just been sitting there for who knows how long (long enough that the ice had melted). And it's a waste of water when you get an OCD customer like myself, who will ask you to bring a fresh pitcher of water with ice in it.  Just bring out the pitcher once the customer arrives. 

The bill came and there were 0 concessions for the hair situation. Yes, you brought out a new dish. That's expected. No, I did not appear to be angry, but I was livid and disgusted. There was HAIR in my baby's food! Department of Health &/or Public Safety, hello?! I just chose to behave in a civil and professional manner.  Wrong is wrong, and one should not have to rant and rave or throw a hissy fit to be accommodated in such circumstances.  I did not ask, but as a customer service gesture, that dish should've been removed from my bill.  Despite the excellent Gobi Manchurian and puri/ poori, or the friendly smiles, that was a deal-breaker, so sadly, I have no plans to return."}
{"text":"Had the opportunity of taking the family for dinner on a Tuesday evening. Was pleased with the warm greeting and laid back atmosphere. Before arriving to our table it was obvious that this was a family oriented restuaunt with large tables easily sitting groups larger then 8. 

My younger brother almost had a panic attack when he realized it was a vegetarian restaurant. However, after our meal everyone agreed that the food was delicious and filling. 

Family asks me when we are going back every time I visit Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service. I was there with a large group and we all had the buffet. The servers went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of. I wouldn't hesitate to return!"}
{"text":"Great food over all. Wasn't expecting to only have buffet for lunch. Would love to come back another time when you can order more South Indian dishes from the menu. They gave great portions and complimentary fresh dosas with your meal. 
Will be back again next time mom is in town to visit. Pure vegetarian and clean environment."}
{"text":"I did not like the menu items during lunch buffet. All curries were okay and tasted on the sweet side. Naan were cold and chewy also no good indian snacks (costco spring rolls ) Surprisingly their price was 10$, which is very reasonable. But I would not like to try the same menu as the food was just okay."}
{"text":"Under new ownership now since my last review, here are some of the things I found need to be improved:
1) Masala Dosas that are included in the buffet need to be piping hot, golden brown and crisp, savory and delicious.
2) Idlis also ought to be fresh, soft and steaming hot.
3) I'm not in favor of water bottles rather than fresh cold ice water from pitcher.
4) Service can be a bit more attentive with customer feedback/questions etc.
5) This must be for the duration of the buffet and not just at opening.
It would be nice if staff explained the variety of South Indian delicacies and their traditional popularity and reasons for it.
People need to know how Indian food is healthy and painstakingly prepared as opposed to just thrown together and cooked.
It is labor intensive and that needs to come out and speak for itself when tasted.
Good luck to these guys, they seem to be making a decent effort."}
{"text":"Very tasty and good variety. I would rated a little higher but for vegetarian cuisine this was expensive."}
{"text":"Among the best Indian places in Phoenix metro.  Staff is much more attentive during buffet with drink refills and replenishing my dosas compared to other places.  Everyone was polite, and it's usually a good sign to find oneself dining among so many Indian families.  Prices are reasonable and parking is generous.  Only drawback, and a somewhat minor one, is that it's just not a very nice neighborhood & general area."}
{"text":"What a wonderful experience!  The service was wonderful and the good was excellent. We are new to Indian good do we were not sure what to order. All we had to do was ask and they helped us choose out items. Everything we had was so flavorful. We will be back again."}
