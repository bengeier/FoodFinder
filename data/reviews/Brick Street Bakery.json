{"text":"The custard (portuguese style) tarts are heavenly delicious and the coronation chicken sandwich is very tasty. Will be back!"}
{"text":"The Brick Street Club is probably one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. The only real downside is that as a result of their awesome food and small size they're often swamped and it can take a while to get your food."}
{"text":"Staff are not very service oriented, they came off as rude. Also the vegetarian quiche I got was terrible. Soggy and cold and definitely not fresh.

There are a lot of reviews saying staff are rude here on yelp so I guess this is the norm at this place."}
{"text":"My husband and I are luke warm on Brick Street Breads located on Logan minutes from our home. But the Bakery on Mill street is a real different story. We popped in to Brick Street Bakery today for some sandwiches. The vegetarian sandwich, like most with that name, was made of cold roasted vegetables with a smear of creamy fresh goat cheese.  Usually these sandwiches make me roll my eyes in boredom, but oh my goodness, in this case it was amazing!  The zucchini, eggplant, red pepper melange was cooked perfectly.   The bread was fresh, hearty, and a touch moist...no doubt, the olive oil from the veggies.  My husband chose the chicken club.  It was served on a kaiser bun and it was MASSIVE.  We could not resist the sweets and took with us some buttery tollhouse cookies, and a slice of ginger loaf."}
{"text":"The Brick Street Bakery is the place to stop for a sandwich in the Distillery. The Boxing Day sandwich is probably my favourite then The Coronation chicken. The Tuna is pretty good too. 

I can't comment on the meat pies or any of the treats..... 

There is a nice seating area outside which is perfect for people watching & sandwich eating.

**The sandwiches are HUGE and great for sharing - you'll end up caring the other half around - trust me**

If I was a tourist, I would thank me for this review. (I've saved someone a couple of bucks & told them about a yummy lunch)"}
{"text":"5 words: Orange White Chocolate Chip Cookie!  Place is great, wonderful atmosphere, great service, and so many things to choose from.  It was my first visit to Toronto/Canada and this is a must try for anyone visiting the area.  Brick Street Bakery, please open a location in Austin, Texas! Cheers!"}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try the Canadian nanaimo bar and this place has a very good one!"}
{"text":"Nice, quick spot for lunch. I picked up the Brick Street Club. Definitely not what I expected, but really good. The marinated chicken was tasty. The portions are huge. The sandwich was easily big enough for 2. I was happy I stopped by."}
{"text":"Love this place. Their lemon tarts and bakewell tarts are great!"}
{"text":"We were in the distillery district and stumbled upon this bakery. It's a cute little place with a lot of baked goods. We came at about 5pm and a lot of their shelves were empty. We decided to get one of their croissants and chose the chocolate one. It was pretty good but nothing special. I'm sure if they heated it up a bit it would of been a little more appetizing since the chocolate would of melted and the croissants itself would of become softer, but otherwise, id you're in the area, stop by and try some of their things."}
{"text":"It used to be a great place to eat. But the food has gone majorly downhill. As a used to be regular and living around the corner I can list just about everything that sucks now. 
The scones are literally half the size that they used to be, and not nearly as fluffy and delicious as they were but the price remained the same. I also used to always get the pulled pork, but the last few times they were so small! And just didnt taste the same. I decided to ask the cashier and she told me it has new owners and they weigh the meat now and they all have gone down in size significantly. 

Also, don't even get me started about the cookies. They used to be $1.10 and $1.25, now they are $1.60 and $1.80! They were probably the best thing they had, but now they are almost never soft and often burnt. The croissants are also often burnt. 

The one nice thing about the place is the girls that work the front. I love that they remember what I ussually get, and they are always super friendly and helpful. In fact, they are so nice they have started apologizing for the lack of quality in the food. I can see that they obviously no longer liking their jobs, a few weeks ago they were openly talking with themselves about the problems with the work. These are the things I over heard:
-The boxing day sandwhich now has from the box stuffing(yuck)
-There is a major mouse problem
-They've changed the recipes to make everything cheaper and worse
-The kitchen is filthy and never cleaned properly
-The girls never get breaks, and sometimes work 10+ hours while the owners are sitting outside
-For the last few weeks they have not been receiving tips. so DO NOT TIP, its going right in the owners pocket. 

I don't want to get the girls in trouble because they are great, and bad work situations lead to unhappy employees. Like I said, it used to be a gem in the distillery, but now its just below average and over priced."}
{"text":"I was just here yesterday morning and I was served by two rude employees at the Distillery District store (both young women) who called me fat and talked rudely about me to each other right in my face for ordering a cinnamon bun at 11 am. One said \"What's wrong with people who order cinnamon bun before noon? They're going to get fat.\" The other girl just laughed and agreed.

This is very hurtful and may be triggering for those who may have eating disorders or anyone else with body issues. By allowing this behaviour to slide, you are encouraging bullying and harassment of customers. I hope you can get your team to reconsider how you treat your customers."}
{"text":"Excellent, succulent Cornish pasty. Good value, and loaded with fresh tasting goodness. They seem to do a brisk business (don't be afraid to ask for the pastry you want), but the line moves quickly. Nice selection of English style favorites (pasties, sausage rolls, etc)."}
{"text":"Lovin' the Brick. 

Best sandwich within a 20 block radius of my work, the Coronation Chicken is damn tasty. Fruity, not too sweet, with curry! crunchy apple! and chicken! and homemade bread! AGH, why so good?! 

Once I made the mistake of getting the egg salad instead of my beloved Coronation, and it was sloppy, mayo-saturated, bland badness. 

Sweet folks behind the counter, without the requisite Distillery pretension."}
{"text":"Amazing service!! The entire staff is so friendly!! I've had many item on the menu: bake goods (toll house cookie, oatmeal chocolate chip cookie YUM!).  I recently had the sunshine box breakfast it was amazing!! The turkey chili is fantastic!! My favorite spot in the distillery"}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood so I've had probably had 200 of their almond (and chocolate) croissants.  I always went back for them because I thought they were tasty and good value... Until, about six months ago, I noticed they were significantly smaller than they had been for the past years (cutting costs, I imagine). I continued to get them, just not as often.  However, last week I got one and I guess not only are they cutting costs but they are also not concerned with quality anymore as it was burnt along with all of the other one's from that batch.  Needless to say, I won't be eating their croissants anymore.... too bad since it's my neighborhood bakery."}
{"text":"Finally got to try the coronation chicken sandwich as they have been sold out when I've gone in other times. I get why this sells out, it's so good. Serious, gigantic sandwich. I will definitely be back for this."}
{"text":"Almond Croissant was delicious.  Reminded me of a Chinese pineapple bun because of the delicious fillings inside =)

You gotta try the walnut-carrot cake though.  That thing was impressive.  Could've used another thin layer of frosting on top though.

Take a pass on the sausage roll though.  It's dripping with oil and is a stroke waiting to happen!"}
{"text":"Best sandwiches in the business! The cookies are really good too. Great place, especially on a sunny day when you can sit at their bistro tables."}
{"text":"It is a dangerous, dangerous thing to live so close to this amazing little bakery. 

Located in the heart of the Distillery District, the teeny weeny bakery sits in an old brick building that serves as a time machine, transporting you momentarily away from the craziness of living in downtown Toronto and into a quaint little bakery that would not seem out of place in the early 20th century. 

The set up is simple - you walk into the bakery, up to a counter, and place your order. There are no tables inside, but the service is pretty quick regardless of the order and there is ample room to wait  for your food. Which is more than well worth it, by the way.

Brick Street sells the requisite freshly made breads along with pastries, baked goods, soups, and sandwiches (which are made when you order them, not wrapped in plastic and tossed on a shelf to sit all day). 

The service is spectacular. The girls that work in the shop seem to have mastered the art of friendly banter while still whipping off orders at top speed. A fairly hefty challenge during the weekday lunch rush.
As a regular, I'm always greeted with an enthusiastic \"Hey there!\" and \"The usual, Grace?\"  - Top notch all around. 

They sell cups of coffee for two bucks a piece. No fancy schmancy mocha lattes, just a classic cup of coffee that you can milk and sugar yourself, should you be so inclined. Best cup of coffee I've found in Toronto. 

You MUST try: the Bakewell tart, the butter scone, the BLT, the boxing day sandwich, the elusive (but delicious) Brioche loaf,  and whatever the soup of the day is when you get there.

Oh, and the coffee, of course."}
{"text":"Best sandwiches in Toronto!

Stumbled into this place yesterday and split the turkey sandwich and the braised lamb sandwich. They were incredible and huge for the price.

Such a great deal!"}
{"text":"Come here every time I stop by the Distillery District. Good for a quick snack, haven't tried the sandwiches (yet). The macarons are a bit inconsistent but edible, not as good as the other baked goods like the croissants. 

Bottom line: definitely worth a try. Will be coming back."}
{"text":"I adore their baked goods, but today wasn't the best. I ordered a schnitzel with fries to go and I didn't get to open my container until I got home. 

When I opened the styrofoam box, I saw this and I was disappointed. My schnitzel looked more like a burnt chicken strip! My sister heard my loud sigh, looked at my food, and then laughed at my disappointment. 

But no fear, I understand that people have off days and this doesn't deter me from coming back. Still love their baked goods! (I just won't get their schnitzels again)."}
{"text":"More like 3.5 - a solid 4 if they're not busy, because their food is very good.  I love the sandwiches.  But it they're busy, prepare yourself for a long wait in the chaos.  They're not really organized to move quickly, so it can be frustrating."}
{"text":"My husband & I thought this bakery was totally gross.  I got the spinach feta pastry and it was disgusting - dry, bland, and hardly any cheese.  My husband got a sausage roll and it was not cooked properly.  We got some other stuff too, but we just ended up throwing everything away because we were pissed.  We just ended up going somewhere else."}
{"text":"Brick Street Bakery is a magical place of red brick and wonderful bread.
This bakery is by the main entrance of the Distillery District and it's always packed.

Every time I come here, I try to have something different.
* Sausage rolls: They seem so simple, but I was surprised at how awesome they were. The spiced sausage was freaking delicious and juicy.  The flaky pastry was delightful.  I was surprised how much stuffing there was!

* Custard Brioche: OMG, the brioches remind me of a giant bread muffin.  Now fill it with vanilla custard.  Sweet and filling, mmm bready.

* The banana loaf was good.  It's banana loaf.  
They have apple loaf and ginger loaf as well, which are interesting.

* Not a huge fan of the macarons... at all.  Over sweet... under flavoured.

They have a good list of sandwiches on the chalk board at the back.
They are made on fresh bread and delicious, but also a bit pricey.

The Coronation Chicken sandwich is a lightly curried chicken-salad sandwich.
It was pretty good considering that I hate chicken salad.  I didn't read the description properly.  I can only imagine that the other sandwiches are awesome.

This bakery is great place to grab a coffee and snack before exploring the area.

Just don't expect to sit down.

Also, in the summer if you are able to get a seat outside,  you can see the tourists getting briefed for segway tours.  I find segways silly and entertaining, I'm not sure why."}
{"text":"Love this location! The wheat free spelt bread is fantastic (by the loaf) and they have very tasty gluten free chocolate almond cookies!"}
{"text":"A very business and a little pricey bakery. The service was fast and they do need to get people in and out as its a very small place inside. 

I tired their spinach pastry, which was quite good and the last one left."}
{"text":"What an adorable place.  We ordered two 'pies' to go for our drive back home.  What is actually really nice and really smart is 'branding' the initials of the pie in the dough before cooking.  How else will you be able to know what's what?  Clever.  We ate them a few hours later after re-heating.  Mine was the chicken tarragon and was good but my BF had the Steak and Gorgonzola and was blown away by it.  While we won't be back any time soon since we live far away, it was a nice treat and I recommend to others."}
{"text":"We went for a continental breakfast: pastries and a hot beverage.  The baked goods are excellent: every bit as good as those in France and Germany.  We had croissant and turnovers.  The service is friendly and the coffee is Ok.  Bonus: some small amount of outdoor seating"}
{"text":"I've only had the Cornish pasties and Bakewell tarts, because they are so perfect I can't risk it and try anything else. Better than most Cornish pasties in the UK, filled with delicious beef and veggies, and fantastic crumbly pastry. Despite being very sweet (which is typical) the Bakewell tart had the perfect balance of almondy crumble and crispiness. Worth making an effort to visit, maybe I'll get around to trying something else next time."}
{"text":"Located a few steps from the entrance of the Distillery District, Brick Street Bakery is a cute little shop filled with fresh pastries, bread and savoury goods. Just inhale and start salivating.

We both ordered an almond croissant, which was not only massive, but cheap (came to around $2.50 after tax) and VERY tasty. They did not skimp out on the frangipane filling and the pastry was very well made with many visible layers. Delicious! Soft fluffy interior with a crispy exterior. Would have ordered more things to try but had other food plans for the day sadly.

There is outdoor seating, kind of like the terrasses in French cafes. Small tables to enjoy your pastry and a drink."}
{"text":"Brick Street Bakery is such a wonderful place located in the distillery district.  The sandwiches here are amazing, I got the pulled pork and it was stuffed with meat. (see pic) Sandwiches are around $10 which is quite expensive as you don't get any sides with it.  They also sell a bunch of baked goods from macaroons, tarts to scones and of course fresh bread. They also have cookies, cheese sticks and soup of the day. Brick Street Bakery have 5-6 patio tables outside for you to enjoy your meal and make a perfect combo in the hotter months.  Parking is street parking couple streets down or private lots.  As in most places in distillery the decor is of the olden era which is nicely kept intact - everything in the store screams old and makes the place that much more special.  The cashier was super nice and recommended items to us.

{"text":"This place is great! 

Lots of pastry options. 
Lots of bread options as well. All made fresh daily! 
On top of all the baked goods, they also have a great lunch menu to pick from with daily specials. The food is a little bit on the pricier side, but still decent. 

Their standard breakfast runs 8am-12pm (weekdays) and til 1pm (weekends) which is surprisingly cheaper than everything else. 

*UPDATE*
They have expanded their interior. They now have a little sitting spot. This place feels a bit less crowded due to the extra space!! 

They have also expanded their breakfast sandwich hours from 8am-5pm!! 

The breakfast sandwich was very fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"If you can get past the \"look at us...we're so trendy and organic and small and exclusive\" vibe that seems to be the thing at EVERY new Leslieville eatery or cafe...what you find is a fantastic little bakery that not only offers delicious baked goods, but also whips up some SUPREME lunch time sandwiches every day.  All sandwiches are, to quote Moe from the Simpsons, \"the size of a toilet seat.\"  Served up on an amazing hunk of their organic multigrain bread.  Chicken Salad, Roast Beef, Egg Salad, and Tuna Salad all done with a little flair and fresh ingredients.  The prices are sadly not as good as the food ($7.50 for a sandwich that comes with nothing is too much in my mind) but again, that's Leslieville these days.  I recommend it to anyone working in the Film Ghetto to pop into this hidden gem and enjoy some carbohydrates in spades!"}
{"text":"This is a great bakery if you're not looking to sit down and have a meal.  They don't really have seating, but there are plenty of spots to enjoy your baked goods around the distillery district. 

The servers are fast, friendly and polite.  Even when there is a huge line up they are willing to explain the different baked goods and any specials they have available.  My personal favourites are the sausage rolls and their sandwiches.  Their bread is made in house and it's refreshing to have such fresh loafs.

Overall a great place to stop by for lunch or a snack on the go when you're around the distillery district area!"}
{"text":"Awful experience from beginning to end.

Stopped by to do a take-out order and sit in the sun on the first nice sunny weekend all year.  I lined up (long lines) and ordered a soup of the day and a \"warm\" BLT to go . The BLT was listed as having marinated chicken, bacon, tomato, onion and mayo, on a ciabatta bun.  In my head, how I picture that, is warn chicken, the rest cold.  

I thankfully said \"yes\" when she asked if I wanted a receipt.  This is because I then needed the time stamp to show how long I ended up waiting for my soup and sandwich, watching everyone else get their food and leave (total time waiting: 20 minutes).  During that time, I saw my soup just sitting on the counter in the kitchen, and them discussing the fact they hadn't made my sandwich yet.  But they continued to still make other people's food before mine.  Finally, I asked for a refund.  The lady behind the cash said, \"Oh it's just a new girl back there.\"  Which might be the reason, but you all knew there was an issue (telling her yourselves and also me letting you know how long I'd been waiting) and still didn't expedite the process.  After getting my refund, I asked if I could take the sandwich at that point, since I'd spent 30 minutes (30 actual minutes!) waiting for it.  This was the biggest mistake of the day.  IT WAS AWFUL.  The chicken was marinated in a bbq/tomato sauce hybrid, and then slathered in (warm) mayo.  Putting raw tomatoes on tomatoy chicken makes no sense, plus why put mayo on if the chicken was in a warm tomato sauce? Couldn't even eat it because it was so messy and half assed.  

Would never, ever go back."}
{"text":"With their doorway just feet from the pedestrian entrance to the Distillery District, you might think they built a business out of convenient location. I can confirm that it patently untrue. I was there yesterday and the custard tart knocked my socks off! It was the perfect small treat, and so delicious. The pastry wasn't as flaky due to the custard's moisture, but it didn't take away from it at all. I also took a chocolate croissant to go and had it for breakfast today. Happily it was still flaky and very tasty. 

The one thing they could use are some additional tables and chairs."}
{"text":"I can still remember the sweet aroma of the bread as I walked by the Brick Street Bakery. I tried to keep the drool from spilling out of my mouth, but I failed miserably and succumbed to my oinker tendencies. I decided to go for a simple piece of white bread (sounds sad, I know) and was smitten by the moist and sweetness that melted in my mouth. Yes... I love bread... and I love eating it plain. I was sold and bought a loaf to bring back to the States. Thing is, it didn't end up on the plain with me... I devoured it on the cab ride to the airport."}
{"text":"okay so forget the croissants and the sandwiches that were a fail here. the sausage rolls. oh.my.
I don't even like sausages but after two of my friends raved about it, I thought I would give it a try.  so SO good.  The pastry on the outside is super flaky, light and o so buttery.  The sausage is seasoned amazingly.   I would def come again just to get this!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here briefly to try the macarons. We got two -- the raspberry and the hazelnut. I was surprised at how tacky the inside of the macarons were, not the usual crunchy outside soft inside. It wasn't old or stale, just not as enjoyable. I did like the fruity flavor of the raspberry, though my friend mentioned it reminded her a little of fruit loops. The hazelnut had good flavor, but not outstanding.

Sounds like the sandwiches are the thing to try here!"}
{"text":"Orange Marmalade White Chocolate Cookie.  FOR THE WIN!  We were doing an event venue search today and of course, took some time to check out the Distillery District.  I saw a bakery and thought, I want a treat!  Love the balance of treats, bread and lunch items.  The inside is pretty bare bones and nothing to write home about but I can see how super cute the patio space is during warmer weather and my cookie was moist and really good.  Would love to try the bread from here one day next time I go for a visit!"}
{"text":"This review is based on the macarons only.

I love macarons but these were sub-par... chewy and not very flavorful. Tried the strawberry, lemon, mocha, and orange. They were all chewy, not flaky at all. The flavors weren't bad but they weren't good either.  Just kind of meh.

In the future, I'll be getting macarons from Marianna's Macarons in Alexandria, Virginia."}
{"text":"Brick Street Bakery - Totally worth the passport stamp. There, I said it. 

When you're looking for a really terrific lunch in the Distillery District, come here for a sandwich. We sat down with a Roast Beef Sandwich, Lamb Sandwich, Vegetarian Sandwich and a Turkey Chili. You know its good when we're quiet during lunch - not because we're fighting. We each tried a little of the others' respective sandwiches - for research purposes of course. Let me say that finer sandwiches I haven't had in quite a while. Portions were perfect and the sandwiches were not over seasoned so natural seasons could come through. The chili was a little unusual tasting but in a very good way. Top it all off with a coke in a glass bottle. Now that's a way to start vacation."}
{"text":"Great selection of sweet and salty baked goods, made to order sandwiches and soups. Whatever you choose is going to be fresh and priced reasonably. They also offer freshly brewed coffee and have gluten-free options. Nice little spot in a beautiful neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I regularly buy my lunch here.  Sandwiches are very good and the portions are fairly large, made with their own organic bread.  Lunch items are reasonably priced and so are the fresh loaves of bread.  But the sweets are a bit over priced in my opinion.  The place is a bit crowded at lunch time.  I think they need a bigger store to serve all the locals and tourists at that location.  Sometimes the wait at lunch can be long.  Overall the food is very good quality and has good flavours."}
{"text":"Chocolate brioche was delicious. We got there right as they were closing for the night, so we were offered a baguette to take with us!"}
{"text":"Here's the deal.

The chocolate chip cookie is just...the best thing anyone can eat. Unbelievably good 

The steak and stout pie is phenomenal

The Cornish pastry is also fantastic - sometimes it's a special for $4 - best deal ever 

The chili fries aren't that great, I would avoid -- but the fries are fresh cut so that's nice 

You can't go wrong with bakery sweets and treats here -- it's fresh and delicious 

Service is okay but worth it for the good food in this nice area"}
{"text":"The sandwiches here are yummy - the Boxing Day is my fave (basically Thanksgiving dinner in a sammie complete w/stuffing & cranberry sauce). The best thing I love at BSB is the sausage rolls - perfectly flaky, generous size & generous portion of deliciously seasoned sausage meat. Plus, they're fresh baked throughout the day and kept warm (best way to eat it). 

Pastry-wise, I sometimes grab croissants (butter & almond are my faves) and butter tarts. I wouldn't bother w/the macarons, they do other items much better (like the carrot cake)."}
{"text":"It's been two days since I last had their pulled pork sandwich and my erection still hasn't gone away"}
{"text":"The Piggy's Cluck breakfast sandwich is so good! Also their coffee is great. Would highly recommend for breakfast!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite bakery in Toronto. Very cute location in the distillery district. They have the best cookies I have ever tried in the city. My favourite would probably have to be the oatmeal raisin. I haven't tried many of the sandwiches, but the ones I have tried were great. Overall good food, good service, good location. Can't ask for much more."}
{"text":"Dear. God.

Somewhere between sampling a Cinnamon Toast Crunch ice cream (think of the milk at the bottom of the bowl turned into ice cream), the killer macarons (I tried and loved the maple, vanilla, chocolate, and lavender flavors), and the wicked good chocolate chip and peanut butter cookies, I realized this place had something special.

The confections are great and the staff was friendly. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"LOVE IT  I got the sausage roll that was greatly raved about as well as a lemon raspberry loft. Worth the price"}
{"text":"Delicious bakery with long lines everytime. There aren't any seats inside the store, though they offer a few space outside. I highly recommend the sausage rolls, as they are always a best seller. The sausage rolls have a flaky texture and is warmed up to the perfect amount. The meat pies are also delicious and are about the size of a bread plate. I felt the the tarts were too sweet personally, though this depends on the person."}
{"text":"Best baked goods in the area, on quality + pricing. People in other bake shops nearby are probably not local. Seems silly to rave about a cookie, but this is a great chocolate chip cookie, crispy at the edges, with the right mix between firm and chewy on the inner portions.

Coffee is good, you won't be amazed but it's hot, fresh, you'll like it well enough. 

Pro tip: For amazing value get ginger cake (moist, delicious) or banana bread mini-loaves, at just over $3 they're a steal, I'm used to paying nearly that much for a SLICE.

Outdoor seating when it's nice but this place is strictly take-out in bad weather."}
{"text":"Mediocre sandwiches with the looongest wait time ever. They don't use any spreads on their bread.  Just tuna or egg salad on plain bread with a single romaine lettuce leaf. How easy is that? Why the 20 minute wait people? If there are only 10 choices, how about making a few in advance? Flavours used to be great and worth the wait but the product  has become very bland tasting."}
{"text":"HOLY CRAAAPPERS! This place is the gem of distillery district. As white girls ran pass me to take Instagram shots by the love wall, I ran the other way towards the delicious smell of baked goods. 

The girl working there with the pretty tattoos is super friendly! She gave us one macaron free of charge because one of the ones we bought had a small crack in the shell. Macarons are a pretty decent price- $10 for 6! I tried every flavour except for vanilla since I don't like it. My friend tried the vanilla one and died over it. He said it's the best macaron he's ever had and actually ran back to the store to buy another as we were already walking to the car. He wouldn't shut up about it for about 10 minutes after we got back on the DVP to go home.. He said it tasted like vanilla ice cream jammed into a macaron. The others were flavourful as well. Don't you hate when you attempt to only eat one macaron because you're an adult who can control themselves, but you end up accidentally stuffing your face with all of them and then hating yourself after? Because same. I really enjoyed the pistachio one! Mmm. So good. Some of the macarons were lacking in the chewiness department (the macaron consistency) but they were still really good. I didn't get to try any of the other treats offered because I was already bursting from dinner. It will be a 'must-do'!

I'm definitely going to make this a staple every time I come to distillery from now on."}
{"text":"Ow, it's on Brick.... Streeet.
It's mighty-mighty, just lettin' it all hang out
It's on Brick... Street.
These tarts are stacked and that's a fact
Ain't holding nothing back
Ow, it's on Brick... Street.
Well put-together, everybody knows
This is how the story goes
They know they've got everything
That a fattie needs to get more fat, yeah, yeah
How can they lose with the stuff they use
36 tarts, 24 sausage rolls, 34 dollars, oh what a winning hand.

What to get: Pasteis De Nata (Portuguese Custard Tart)
What else: Sausage Roll, amazing Pot Pies, anything really
Anything else: How do you make a Swiss Roll? Push him off a mountain.

This might be the best Pasteis De Nata in Toronto, and Toronto has lots and lots of them. They're incredibly delicious, flaky, slightly burned-tasting custardy tarts direct from Brazil or Portugal, and they're absolute heaven. You'll be in paradise faster than Chris Martin when he shot an apple off his head.

Possibly the best tart I've ever tried, and definitely right up there with Progress and Golden Wheat (the other great ones in Toronto). Easily a 5 star, although parking can be tricky because it's on a fancy pedestrian-only street. It's so worth a visit, you'll absolutely love it.

The sausage rolls are wonderful, reminding me of England. A little on the dry side but still heaven. The pot pies are something else entirely. Most people in North America have no idea how to make a real pie. It's an English thing. Brick Street gets it. They're huge, hearty, flavourful and delicious.

Yes this place is expensive as freak but you know, when the goods are this amazing, it's worth every last Canadian Peso.

And if people are mean to you on the way in or out, it's nothing personal. There's a reason they named this street Pr**k Street."}
{"text":"Wandering down a random alley in the middle of the Distillery District you will find one the best bakery's I have ever been too.
From yummy tarts, tasty macarons, cookies, rolls, breads, to larger 'food' options.  The make the most tasty hot sandwiches ever on the freshest bread you can imagine. The lamb sandwich is simply devine! It's soft, tasty, and full of flavor with this amazing spicy type sauce that I wish they bottled.
Totally worth the trip if you are in the neighborhood or not."}
{"text":"Located in the historic Distillery District, this bakery boasts to have some of the best bread and sandwiches in the area. My friends and I grabbed lunch here on a Monday afternoon. I got the sausage roll and turkey chili based on the reviews.

The sausage roll was very flaky and full of chopped sausage. I honestly did not expect it be so filling. The chili was hearty and healthy and did not taste as fatty as some chilis do. Both were filling and warmed me up on a chilly, windy day.

My friend got the pulled pork sandwich, which she really liked. Very saucy though so it got kinda messy eating it, but it was good too!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch and were quite excited with how good everything looked. As well as how busy they were.
I got a Thanksgiving sandwich (I LOVE these kinds of sandwiches). I did not love this one. It said it was warm, but it wasn't. And they claimed they were unable to further warm it up. Really? How is that possible - it's all one giant bakery. I was also generally disappointed - had carrot stuffing that sounded really good, but ended up being pretty bland and boring.
My girlfriend got a vegetable sandwich, which she asked for without mayo. Guess what? Full of mayo. She was not generally impressed with it.
The tables outside were quite nice as it was a beautiful day.
We finished with a chocolate almond cookie - it was a bit dry, but quite tasty."}
{"text":"I live in the area & so wish this bakery was better than it is. Let me start with the meat pies, they the worst I've ever eaten ;( the pastry is more sweet than savory & the filling is so moist the bottom falls apart when you take it out of the foil. My last pie with beef & veggies, not sure why they call it that, I did see very small pieces of meat but the main filling was carrots, onion & potatoes. Very disappointing ;( I purchase their bread often but noticed the last baguette was 2 inch shorter than previous, hope this isn't a trend. I think this is your typical 'tourist spot' & are not focused on quality."}
{"text":"This place is too underrated. I would not have discovered it in my foodie trail across Toronto if not for a big billboard advertising the Bests of Toronto found in a random alley amidst the Distillery District.

Tried its popular Date Rectangle, which was a flapjack actually. I devoured the flapjack in under 10 minutes. I never knew a flapjack could be that delicious!!!!

Tried its mocha-flavoured macaroon. This macaroon was very different from all the other macaroons I have tried so far. Not frenchie as the meringue cookies flanking the filling were crunchy, like how real meringue is supposed to be like. The macaroon was served cold as well, probably to maintain the crunchiness of the meringue crusts. The filling was more buttery than jam-like. Despite its peculiar unmacarooness, I really liked it. I would have bought a box of 6 macaroons if I were less destitute.

This Bakery was touted to be the Best Bakery in Toronto by the billboard. I believe so."}
{"text":"One of the best sandwich/coffee combo I had since I moved to Toronto. Very friendly staff - just very great products. No rooms to sit except for outside"}
{"text":"After heading through the pedestrian entrance, I peered to my left and came face-to-storefront with Brick Street. I can rarely resist a bakery and this one was in the Distillery District -- making it even harder!

Upon walking in, I was greeted with the most wonderful smell of sugar mixed with happiness wafting through the air. Then I looked over and saw the macarons in all their glory begging me to buy and eat them.

Buy and eat them I so did. Two each: orange blossom, strawberry, vanilla.

These macarons were beautiful little specimens. I want more. I want more right now.

But do you know how far Toronto is from me right now?? An hour and 25 minute flight. A seven hour and 57 minute drive. 767 kilometers.

It's far. It's too far. These macarons are too far from me. I disapprove of this wholeheartedly.


...I also had a blueberry cream cheese triangle. That was good too."}
{"text":"Really great place to eat in the Distillery. A little pricey but the sandwiches are worth it. Brick Street and the Distillery market are the best 'quick bite' stops in the district. 
If you can pick a loaf up of any of their bread, do it! You'll want to save it for ever."}
{"text":"I finally made it to this bakery one morning around the start of December. The pictures on Yelp of the display of pastries and baked goods made it look charming and inviting enough to give it a shot. Of course this meant planning a morning trip on a suitable day all the way down to the Distillery District from where I live around Sheppard and Yonge. 
I'll just say that the trouble getting down there was rewarded with some goodies that I took home, even though I feel that there should have been at least two people tending the front area, one to take the sandwich and soup orders while handling the cash register and another to assist with getting the cakes and cookies for the customer. I did have to ask the sole person out front to come with be me over to the display of baked goods because I just couldn't remember which items I wanted to get.
Still, despite this one small set-back the baked goods still tasted good and of course they were all packed in a pastry box sealed with a sticker of the store's logo.
I might return when the weather is warmer because I still want to get a taste of the other items. It just seems a good place to stop by to get some pastries after exploring the district."}
{"text":"While walking around the Distillery District in Toronto, we decided to grab a quick bite since we were in a bit of a rush and this place fit the bill.

We tried two of their sandwiches (a pulled pork sandwich and a vegetarian one).  Both were quite tasty and the bread was really fresh.  I also tried two of their desserts (a cookie and a brownie) and both were quite nice.

Their prices are affordable and if I was in the neighborhood again, I would go back.

If the weather is nice, they have tables outside for seating.  There isn't any place indoors to sit.

One other thing to note is that they only accept cash or debit.  No credit."}
{"text":"This is where yummy lives.
My goodness, I am totally addicted their sausage rolls.  Simple little thing but I have never had such a wonderful combination of spiced pork sausage and flaky pastry.  I am drooling just thinking about it.

I made the mistake of thinking I could eat two of these in a row.  Very filling! Highly recommend it.

I have tried a myriad of cookies and snacks from them. A definite fresh and homemade sense to each one of them. My favourite thing among them is the oatmeal chocolate chip cookie. However, all the other goodies I have tried - excellent.

On my next trip, the lamb sandwich. I have heard rave reviews from friends who have tried it.

Strangely enough, I haven't tried their bread which if the rest of their baked is any any indication of the quality, I doubt I will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Many many - many years ago, I had lamb for the first time ever here, in one of the warm sandwiches they make. It was a food epiphany of my youth. Now, they still make the same sandwich, and it's still as quaint and satisfying as it used to be. I like buying loafs of bread here. Other people like the desserts. Walk-in shop only, no seating except outside."}
{"text":"My husband had heard a lot of great things about this place. As soon as we got in it smelled delicious in there. 
Everything looked amazing. We so badly wanted to have their sausage rolls but unfortunately they had run out of those.... so basically it was our bad luck. We hope to have better luck next time!!
So we decided to get a pie and a wrap and order our desserts later.
We got a creamy chicken pie and a coronation wrap. Both of them were mehhhh.... i expected better. Pie was just alright no great we have had better infact way better. And the wrap was i don't know what it was a curry flavoured chicken wrap, over sweet. Me and my husband couldn't finish one wrap together, left over half of it.
Because both the dishes weren't that great we decided to have our desserts next time, just didn't feel like having it then.
I am sure it is a good bakery the aroma was good but we just made the wrong choice of items. When we go there next time I am gonna choose some desserts."}
{"text":"Every Sandwich is good (except the egg salad, but that's my opinion - maybe it's not salty enough? Maybe it's just bland...) so you should go for lunch (Open Mondays!). The Boxing Day is KILLER, as is the Lamb (in both sandwich and wrap form) but hey, Pulled Pork is great too, and the Coronation Chicken...MMMMM!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, yummy breads and for such a high traffic visited area.  There's not anywhere to sit except outside...in the snow but that doesn't degrade the quality of their food.  We had the brick street club and the boxing day sandwich.  Both very different in flavors but they were devoured within minutes, so that's always a good sign.  I would recommend trying multiple things while here - there's plenty of selection and grab a coffee/tea from Balzac's down the way."}
{"text":"Have come here twice now. The first time I tried the roasted vegetable sandwich which was okay. At my last visit, I had the coronation chicken sandwich which was very delicious. I find service a bit slow just to make a sandwich. Overall, a decent place to grab a quick lunch while in the distillery district."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick snack while I was walking around the Distillery District and stumbled upon Brick Street Bakery. It seemed pretty popular (they have four locations) as there was a constant flow of people coming in and out so I stepped inside to take a look. It smelled heavenly inside. Nothing like the fresh smell of baked goodies.

They have warm and cold sandwich options along with a couple of daily soups.

One of the pastry displays. Lots of selection to choose from including loafs, tarts, macarons and bars. Would love to have tried out their fresh loaves!

No place to sit inside but there are a handful of tables outside. Similar to the cute French cafe type of seating.

- Almond croissant ($2.25) - light, flaky, buttery and a generous portion of the frangipane filling. I was content after devouring this.

No complaints on my end! Perfect spot to grab a bite before/after exploring the Distillery area."}
{"text":"The food here isn't bad. I ordered a club sandwich (because they had run out of almost everything else by 4pm...HOW?!?!?!). It was your average run of the mill sandwich, no better or worse than something I could have made by myself. 

The place is super cutesy and is a nice place to sit and hang out in the distillery district that won't break the bank. 

The service is AWFUL!!! I understand that everyone has bad days (having worked in the service industry myself), but at the end of the day, your job is service! It's glacially slow (seriously, how long does it take to make a sandwich), and the cashier is rude and surely, which sours the entire experience. 

If you have to grab something this isn't a bad place, but make it something she can pull from the case and hand you, and then walk out and sit on the patio!!!"}
{"text":"Te appropriate name for this little gem of a bakery should be The
 Gold Brick Bakery.
Sunday morning we enjoyed two coffees, two mini muffins and purchased a loaf of bread for later... Not much change left from a twenty spot. Ouch!

The bread is amazing yes indeed.. It was just the hit I needed as I miss my San Francisco Semifredi's baked goods and of course the sour dough from the Bay Area, but be warned it's a lot a dough for just....dough."}
{"text":"This is the first bakery that you see when you enter the Distillery District.  There's not a lot of room in there, but they have a very wide variety of products.  They make a yummy chocolate hazelnut tart, where the hazelnut is ground so fine that it almost appears to be flour.  The best part is that the prices are VERY reasonable.

They have some outdoor seating, which is a nice touch."}
{"text":"I love both the exterior and interior of this place. It's situated right by the main entrance (I think?) of the Distillery District so it's hard to miss... they'll be one of the first establishments that you'll notice. 

They sell a variety of items from cookies to pastries to meat pies. Today (Sunday morning), I decided to pick up a couple of brioche and a chocolate croissant. They were quite hard and it was difficult to eat. I was here at 11, but do baked goods harden that quickly? 

It's tiny so don't expect to buy food and sit down. I think there's space for 2 people to sit down, but that's about it. I think I'll be back as their meat pies looked really good. It's a shame that I didn't pick one up for home too. Prices are pretty average for a bakery. They accept all forms of payment except for credit cards. 

It's a-ok here."}
{"text":"This is one of the best bakeries I have ever been to and it is one of the best in Toronto. 

I loved their hot sandwiches (I had chicken one), the bread is freshly made and dressing was perfect. Shepherd's pie was freshly made and it was so damn good.

Their cookies are so good, I loved walnut one especially."}
{"text":"I came here 1 year ago with my dad distierely ditrict itself it seems like another small city within toronto. I like the decor in the small place and the staff are super friendly. You can tell the pastries are fresh because they don't  have the weird texture like tim hortons frozen doughnuts. They also make really good espresso. Service is quick and efficient and you can tell have very good quality ingredients"}
{"text":"We stopped here for some pastries after my birthday dinner. I am thinking my impression might have been a little more positive if it were a slightly less busy day -- we were still in the thick of the Pan Am Games at the time of our visit, and the Athletes Village was near to the Distillery District, making it so that pretty much every business was constantly busy.

We got a couple of butter tarts, which were quite good, and also a nanaimo bar, which was a little less good -- it tasted kind of dry and not really that awesome. I definitely think I'm going to have to give it another visit to reasses."}
{"text":"Fantastic sandwiches! 

Also, try the turkey chili with cheese if it's available. Sooo good and it comes with a slice of their delicious bread."}
{"text":"Didnt have the time to take pictures of the things I got from here because they just looked too good for the camera to eat first.

I got the almond croissant which was delicious! There's some almond filling inside and the outside was covered in almonds and a little glaze for extra sweetness and crunch. The inside was very buttery and soft. My friend got the croissant which they found also delicous. 

On Friday after 3PM they have a buy one get one free on select pastries, which the total came up to $2.50 for both! What a steal!

Definitely recommend checking this place out. Delicious baked goodies and service was very friendly as well."}
{"text":"A cute little place near the front of the Distillery District. I was skipping US Thanksgiving to hang out in TO, so their Boxing Day sandwich really hit the spot - stuffing, roast turkey, cranberries, and mayo I believe. They also have a nice assortment of desserts and pastries to choose from. I got a great pastry square called pithi-something. Argh, if anyone knows the name, please let me know!

It was a chilly late November afternoon and I had no desire to eat outside. Luckily they have (very) limited seating indoors - a bench table that fits about three people, right where they store their bulk soda. Meh, so the view's not great but the food is though!"}
{"text":"A great sandwich spot if you're feeling like a treat or if someone else is buying ;)

I rely on the Coronation Chicken Salad, the Boxing Day, or the Veggie sandwich. I am working my way up to the delicious-looking extras like their tarts, cookies, brownies, and buns. The bread is all made on the premises and is extremely scrumptious. That's right - SCRUMPTIOUS."}
{"text":"No seating. Sandwiches, croissants, loaves of bread, desserts.
We got pastries and desserts which were good.
We never tried a Nanaimo Bar. it was good with chocolate on top, cream in thr middle, and a chocolate coconut cookie on the bottom"}
{"text":"Brick Street Bakery makes sandwiches that it is a crime to call sandwiches.  They are just too good.  Between 2 slices of their incredible baked bread you can get a variety of fillings that leave you feeling like you just had a small gourmet meal.  My personal fave is the vegetarian, filled with scrumptious roasted veggies.  My husband loves the lamb for its balance of flavours. Each 'sandwich' comes with its own unique mayo/sauce.  They are also famous for their tarts (good hostess gift) and other desserts.  I prefer the non gluten cookies but there are a variety of delicious homemade cookies and desserts to choose from. My mouth is salivating as I think about them. ;-)"}
{"text":"I bought a piece of their \"world famous\" banana bread this afternoon.

It was still frozen when I took a bite.  Huh?!  So much for being fresh!  Once it thawed out, there wasn't much taste to it.

It was one of the worst banana bread I've ever had :("}
{"text":"I love this place... every time we visit the Distillery, we will step in here for some yummy pastries! Would not recommend coming here during the X'mas market times as it was INSANELY busy and the line up was all the way outside... in the cold. You know how I am w/ waiting and all... stupid time to come and on the last day! SIgh Anyhow.

The sausage rolls are amazing. But they sold out for the day when we got there for the X'mas market. I remember having them in the summer. Perhaps it was because we haven't had lunch yet? But it was crunch on the outside and super tasty on the inside.

This time, we ordered the cornish (beef, peas, carrots, etc.) as it had just come out of the oven. It was so fresh and delicious! OMG!! So nice and toasty! So ordering this again next time. But after you have one... you are pretty much set for the meal. Wow!

The chocolate butter tart was disappointing. It was alright but not out of this world. I felt the crust was a bit too hard. 

The shepherd's pie wasn't that tasty either. Needed a little more salt and something more on the mash on top. 

Otherwise, we usually LOVE this place... and can't wait to be back again."}
{"text":"Baked products are pretty good but their sandwiches are excellent. My go to is the braised lamb and peach.

Their bread is worth buying to take home."}
{"text":"Excellent bakery. My fav here is the HOT spinach and cheese turnover and their almond croissant; with the best almond filling in town. Food is fresh and service is superb! Their egg breakfast sandwich is delicious and served on the most thick and fluffy bread, large enough to feed two!"}
{"text":"SUCH A CUTE LIL BAKERY in the distillery district, with the baker working right in front of you!
it's a take out over the counter kind of place but you can sit outside on the patio furniture to enjoy the sun.

you can taste the freshness in their bread,
and all their sandwiches are made from the bread they bake in house --

recommended --
coronation street curry chicken salad sandwich was yum yum and it was about 7 or 8 bucks
the roast beef sandwich was good too
chocolate tart was yum also ~ $2.50 (i went back for a second, and the owner was even surprised to see us three times that day)
and i was so excited to see brioche and a lot of classic french pastries that they offered in the window.

the hardest thing was deciding which to buy!

the only thing they don't have is tea and coffee,
which is wierd.

stop by if you're ever in the district, it made my trip worth it to the area because it's exactly the kind of cafe you expect to be chilling at in the district on a nice sunny day :)"}
{"text":"I just had the best turkey chili of my life at this place.  That is all."}
{"text":"Extremely poor and disrespectful service.  Not all customers are tourists who will accept such bad manners (and don't tell me I am a rude local!!! no one looks and sounds more touristy than me!! to respond to a note from one of the employee of this place who sent me an angry message on yelp telling me that locals are rude, thus deserve rude employees!!! another example of how these employees behave with customers!!). 

Food tastes ok but such poor slow uncaring service eventually spoils everything. Learn to greet customers (and do not make difference between tourists and locals!! just be nice with everyone, especially those persons who PAY!!!). Learn to be there for customers,  not to endlessly chat with colleagues employees!!"}
{"text":"The chocolate and lemon tarts are to DIE for!!!! I went back several times during my visit to Canada."}
{"text":"Great bread, fantastic sanwiches and a cool vibe. Wish they also had real coffee, but guess its too small there. The blt, club, chicken and lime infused tuna sandwiches are incredible. Love it!"}
{"text":"Nice and quaint bakery with a huge selection of great snacks and cheap meals made fresh. Currently waiting in line and can't wait to bite into my breakfast bab."}
{"text":"I have only had the pleasure of entering this establishment a couple of times, but it was all-around lovely. This is hardly surprising as it is located in the ever-lovely Distillery District, and is frequented by lovely people (no, I'm not talking about myself).

The pastries are fresh and rounded like picture perfection, the mood is homey and the bread is like a soft and delicious dream. I have ordered a few sandwiches there, the vegetarian at least twice, and I have to say that my last visit found me very relieved by their *half* sandwich, ready-made and raring to go in its special little half-sandwich holder (this is when I needed a *snack*, mind you, due to an early and small lunch, and a dinner party that couldn't occur as quickly as I needed). The last one on the shelf, but perfectly fresh and melt-in-my-mouth good. I also tried my friend's Kefta once, and it made me rediscover the miracle of lamb --and newly discover the miracle of grinding it...not yourself, of course.

I hadn't been there since the summer, when the surrounding patios were a buzz, the sun making everything seem like the best thing ever. My last time found me sitting alone on the same patio furniture, cold and swallowed by the premature darkness of December; just when all hope seemed to be lost, the most lovely (and first I'd really seen this year) snowfall decorated the area- frequently used for movie sets- like a goddamn movie set. The lights on all those trees helped a bit, too, and for a minute, I saw the beauty in a Canadian winter. A Torontonian one, at least. If I didn't finish that sandwich in about 60 seconds, it's only because my smile was getting in the way."}
{"text":"I only had a quick stop in, so my experience is limited, but thankfully, it was a delicious experience. After agonizing over the enormous selection, we settled on a salted caramel pecan bar, which has the featured ingredients sitting atop an elongated fudge bar. Tasty stuff. If you need a sugar fix, you could do worse. The space is a small, cute shop in the heart of the Distillery District with lots of outside seating (no indoor seating). In addition to the sweets (cookies, macarons, sweet croissants, blueberry cinnamon rolls!!, etc etc), they also offer sandwiches and savory meat pies. I only wish I could have tried more."}
{"text":"Walking around the Historic Distillery District of Toronto, this was one of the few places open in the evening for eating, and the menu sounded good to us so we decided to stop in and grab dinner. The awkward thing is that they have a menu that includes some hearty sandwiches and the like for a meal, but nowhere to eat it, so keep in mind it's takeout only. Despite the lack of room, it's cozy and the food is pretty good. I liked my roasted veggie sandwich and the delicious Toronto-specific dessert that I always forget the name of, a type of dessert bar with chocolate."}
{"text":"I love the rustic feel of Brick Street Bakery... I feel like I have transferred back to the era that I can get something so good, so wholesome, so full of carbs from my local bakery. 

I will suggest not to come here when you are mighty hungry, because everything looks so deliciously good. Sausage Roll oh so round and stuffed, glazed chocolate twist, chocolate/almond croissant can I get them all?? 

It was so crowded on a Sunday afternoon.. I barely able to get inside the door. But I got my oh so buttery/flaky almond croissant ($2) just sniffing the butter aroma.. so heavenly good!"}
{"text":"With many sandwich options broken out for you into two camps (cold and warm), you can't go wrong no matter what you choose. I read some Yelp reviews while in line and they recommended EVERY sandwich on the menu. I committed to the tuna, which was a large sandwich I could have easily shared with someone else. The sandwiches are on the slightly expensive side to not come with chips, soup, or a salad- but they are so good that you won't care.

There is limited outdoor seating, although I found a spot quickly. Even if you end up walking around, it is STILL The Distillery. Absorb your surroundings and be happy. Before I create too much distance between me and Brick Street Bakery, I should highlight their awesome baked goods (go figure, right?). They are just SO yummy! I had a tart that was incredible."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Don't get the sausage roll, it was kind of gross. The piggy sandwich and almond croissant were fine. Service could be better and more welcoming."}
{"text":"Came during Christmas market.  Place was pretty packed.  There is only one table inside.  I ordered the BLT and all i can say is ... its alright i guess.   a friend recommended it to me but it did not blow me out of the water.  I guess all i can say is.. the bun is fresh.. since its a bakery.

Price for BLT is fair considering its in the distillery district.   Staff was friendly and nice."}
{"text":"Great value, hearty sandwiches and cornish pasties. The only misstep was the meatloaf. Otherwise, the lamb and other sandwich fillings are tasty and delicious! It's takeout only but the best value lunch in the district."}
{"text":"Brick Street Bakery is a triple threat bakery. Do they act, sing AND dance? No. But they make good bread, have a nice atmosphere, and know what to do with that bread when they make you one of their Tarana famous sandwiches. 

We were all dressed up and going to a wedding next door. We then realized, we'd hardly eaten all day and the ceremony was at 5:30... likely meaning we weren't eating for at least two hours. My friend joked about getting a sandwich, and then went in to grab some water. I realized he'd been gone a long while and went into the rustic little bakery. There he was... eating a bacon sandwich, turns out he wasn't joking at all. After I was done laughing, I had half the sammie. It was one heck of a sandwich, with perfectly done bacon piled on top of more bacon with a generous amount of cheese. Strangely timed sandwich for the Win!

PLEASE NOTE: They don't have indoor seating, but who cares?! You're in The Distillery. So pretty. 

GOTTA MENTION: Tom from Parks and Recreation can teach you everything you need to know about Sandwiches. Adam Sandler OUT!"}
{"text":"Located in the Distillery District, this place is a small, quaint little bakery, that smells delicious.   I tried a custard tart and it was to die for!   Amazing crust quality, and the custard was bruleed on the top so it was insanely tasty.   
I've been craving one ever since."}
{"text":"Just a short and sweet review. 
I stopped here Saturday afternoon before heading home.  I needed a quick snack for the drive home.   OMG the best sausage roll I've ever had!  the pastry was perfect but the sausage meat was pure perfection!  

I definitely need to try a sandwich next time."}
{"text":"YAY, found another croissant I actually like...!! Not bready on the inside, nice and flaky on the outside. I even got this at the end of the day (coincidentally while I was in the area to go to the fantastic Yelp party last week in the Distillery District) and ate half of it before going to the party. It was cold, as expected, but I had hope cuz the outside looked properly flaky and was crunchy.  Stuck it in my bag and ate it later that night after getting home because I felt munchy. I heated it up in the toaster oven., I dunno if it's because I was pretty hungry, but it was still really good.  Toasting it made it even better.  Too far for me to get it regularly since I'm uptown, luckily I still got Rahier! Definitely would recommend to anybody with a croissant craving downtown :)"}
