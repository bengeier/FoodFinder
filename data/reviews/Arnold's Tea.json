{"text":"Love spending time here. 

Their blended tea drinks are delicious (I love the lavendade and the Arnold on the green), as is their selection of loose leaf teas. 

I enjoy the food here just as much, though! The selection and pricing is sort of like a Panera, but local and better. The pear arugula salad is my go-to. 

The baristas/servers are very friendly, knowledgeable, and accommodating.

I'm not sure if this cafe is conducive to going there to read or work, however. It can get a bit loud during the busy hours, and I think finding an outlet for a laptop would be a challenge."}
{"text":"Not just tea - but also great tea! 
Had a fantastic grilled sandwich, lemon green tea with fresh shaved ginger, and lovely Italian mele. They feature both soy and almond milk in addition to dairy, have local honey and stevia, and green takeout containers. My mouth and tummy are having a VERY good day! Service was prompt and extremely friendly and the space is gorgeous - open, natural wood floors, exposed brick, tons of light, and soft jazz in the background - this place is not just tea."}
{"text":"This is such a cool spot. Really wide open space with lots of seating options, excellent tea, and love the sandwiches too. My favorite is an iced lavenade and a turkey sandwich. So refreshing!"}
{"text":"This is the perfect lunch spot. I love their twisted ginger tea and they have excellent sandwiches and salads"}
{"text":"Just lovely! I had family in from out of town as we all had a relative being treated at AGH. I convinced them to walk the couple of blocks to try this place, as I had read about it somewhere. Though the neighborhood is still on the upswing and has a less than pristine facade, this place is a gem! Beautifully decorated, clean, and welcoming. The staff was helpful and patient. And most importantly the tea was delicious... with the lavender and the peach apple cobbler being my favorites. Everyone in my party ordered teas and sandwiches; and everyone was as equally impressed with the quality."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to have a late lunch on the North Side and stumbled upon Arnold's Tea. What a find! Had a yummy bacon turkey melted cheese club on a baguette and really enjoyed it and the matcha marathon smoothie. Nice ambiance and great too that they participated in Britsburgh with complimentary teas, scones and dainties. Glad we found it and we won't be strangers!"}
{"text":"Can't vouch for the tea or food, but their iced coffee is really good. Friendly staff too."}
{"text":"Today I tried the \"Old School\" Sandwich..   - ham or turkey on swiss- let and tomato on a bagette with honey mustard or mayo.  Ok folks this sandwich was no doubt the bomb diggity!!  It was REAL HAM - not lunch meat.  It was safe to say I was the envy of many of my coworkers at lunchtime.  The sandwich was fresh and so delicious!"}
{"text":"I just hosted a wedding shower here and the staff was excellent. I brought in decor and champagne but the tea setup they arranged beforehand was excellent. The food was great and so was the tea. Thank you Arnold's!"}
{"text":"first time... tried the ice yerba redhead... good tea... needed to be mixed so all the honey did not settle to the bottom... girl at register was not very nice... seemed to be upset i came in while she was cleaning... girl who made drink seemed to be more interested in her cleaning as well... it showed"}
{"text":"I love this place. I am a fan of coffee, not tea so I am biased. But I had this amazing coconut cream chocolate banana something or other blend (it wasn't full of sugary flavoring or anything, it was just the tea) and it was one of the best cups of tea ever. The woman working behind the counter (I think she was the owner) knew all of the teas and could tell me about every blend and flavor. It is a great space and has an extensive menu. I am not from the area, but if I were, I would be there all the time."}
{"text":"After a long day at school on the North Side, I traveled my usual route back to the East on E. Ohio St. Traffic was unusually hectic so I had time to gaze around at my surroundings. That's when I noticed this large store front with a neat interior. I parked my car and walked into the coolest tea and coffee shop I've seen in Pittsburgh. Really sweet customer service and awesome interior. The teas were just as good. I ordered the Lavenade (lavender lemonade) and a green tea. Definitely will go back soon"}
{"text":"Very cool atmosphere, rustic and homey. Larger than I expected on the inside with a side room that has a large couch and tables to work at. Tea is delicious and the staff are friendly."}
{"text":"Arnold's is such a wonderful addition to East Ohio Street. You walk into the lovely space and totally forget you are in the city. It has a cool, welcoming vibe. Ms Verna really knows her stuff and the tea selection is amazing. 

We held an afternoon tea there last month and everything was delicious, especially the kalamata spread on the cranberry bread. You could taste the time and love that went into making all the delicious treats and finger sandwiches. Do yourself a favor and get to the monthly tea. 

If you only have time to stop in for a cold drink their Lavenade is quite refreshing too!"}
{"text":"If the place specializes in tea...I'm there! I found myself on the North Side and I just had to stop here.

When I first walked in I'll admit that it's not what I expected. It was rather large and very inviting. I was greeted by the cashier and, after learning it was my first visit, she made some recommendations. Since I've been drinking hot tea for a few months now, I decided to go with their iced peach apple cobbler tea. My drink arrived with a few dashes of cinnamon on top. It was very, very good! I was surprised by the strength of the flavors since it can be hit or miss with some teas. This had the flavor of your granny's church cobbler and while it's unsweetened, the cinnamon lent a nice sweet flavor to it. 

This would be a great place to have a meeting,  map out a project or just chill. Chill was my goal today....mission accomplished. Very nice place with friendly and engaging service. I shall return."}
{"text":"Yes! A great place with Quality!

Yes there tea is not $.99 a cup is a little more on the expensive side but you have to remember they are ordering and serving quality team made right versus places that sell $.99 tea are just buying massive containers of tea bags that come to about five cents apiece maybe

Overall quality service every time we come in also and the food is excellent too to be honest we come here often for the food more than even the Tea

tons of room for sitting and doing work also!"}
{"text":"Food was awesome (5 star worthy), decor great. Service not so much. My group were the only patrons in the restaurant, yet the staff seemed more interested in chatting than noticing we were standing there waiting. To their credit, they were hospitable when they noticed us."}
{"text":"All of their teas are delicious! Try the Yerba Redhead - it's the best! Plus local honey and tons of food options for lunch."}
{"text":"So glad we found this place. Worked from here for two days straight eating breakfast, lunch, and lots of tea. Great spaces, nice staff, and amazing tea selection."}
{"text":"THEY DISCRIMINATE AGAINST PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND WALK TWO DOORS DOWN TO PRIORY FINE PASTRIES. 

  Came into Arnold's tea today with a trained ESA (emotional support animal) the African American woman behind the counter berated me and my friend. Claiming if we didn't have paperwork we would not be allowed in the store. As we were getting the documentation that my friend needed the animal for her panic attacks the woman said that we would need to wait outside while we did that. This place is discriminatory against people with disabilities and so we took our money and our ESA down the street to Piories Fine Pasties. The coffee is amazing, the sweets are delicious and you are greeted with a smile and respect."}
{"text":"I was looking for lunch on the North Side and happened upon Arnold's Tea.  Very pleasant atmosphere, great service and a really good roast beef sandwich with horse radish sauce.  Well worth it.

Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Alright, so the tea here is very good.  And the inside is cute and it's a great location to meet up with people.  But every time I have been here (and it's only been about 4 times- always in the afternoon), the service is TERRIBLE.  They act like you are bothering them and they can't believe that you are ordering tea (or anything else).  It's pretty unwelcoming.  If you can get past the ordering part- then you are golden.
And they close at 4 not 6 like Yelp says."}
{"text":"This is the cutest cosiest tea shop! They have a great variety of drinks. I got a basil lavender lemonade, the \"lavenade\" and it was so good! They also serve a nice selection of salads, sandwiches, and baked goods. I had the happy turkey club and it was delicious! This is a must-do in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"New favorite coffee shop in Pittsburgh. The tea is tasty, and there are plenty of options. There is also sooo much seating, which makes it an amazing place to study and do work. The staff is friendly, and there is free wifi. There are also huge windows that let in a lot of natural light. A beautiful space, and I hope that it stays open for the summer that I am here, because I have a feeling that I will be coming here a lot!"}
{"text":"Best tea room in Pittsburgh! Great place for breakfast or lunch as well. I have been here quite a few times since it opened earlier this year and I keep coming back because of the loose tea selection, and bright and welcoming atmosphere."}
{"text":"the best tea and sweets place northside has to offer . The coconut cream banana tea is the BEST. The almond crousant tastes super.Can't wait to go to an afternoon tea with tea sandwiches"}
{"text":"This is perfect place to sit relax enjoy a cup of tea and read the newspaper 
I love Arnold's it's always easy to find parking on the street.
The menu isn't huge but it offers nice fresh food like a pear salad
They have a few sandwich's
And their soup is always filling and good 
Their lentil is my fav though a sign says no soup till October 
We are currently enjoying a cold wintery April
So go to Arnold's for a perfect cup of hot chai tea and one of their yummy loaf cakes
They never disappoint 
There are other milk choices for your tea and I appreciate that
Big open space nice tables 
The chef tea masters that work there are very friendly and welcoming"}
{"text":"The sandwiches here are amazing. I had the hammertime (ham & Gouda on a croissant) and my friend had the happy turkey club. Both sandwiches were deliciously carved, thick slices. Not a pile of thin slices. I can't wait to go back and try the roast beef with horseradish! 

The venue is spacious with nice food furniture. There is a communal loungy area that would be good for an casual lunch group."}
{"text":"I love this space! It's so beautiful, and of course the tea and baked goods are wonderful. Sandwiches and salads are made with care when ordered. So glad to see this place in the neighborhood. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"A cute tea shop with teas, sandwiches, and pastries! They have plenty of seating and friendly staff! I am not really a tea person, but it was a hot day, so I decided to give this place a try. The pomegranate white tea was light and refreshing. My mom ordered the strawberry tea lemonade which was good too-they make it with Minute Maid Lemonade. Next time I will try the sandwiches, as I was still full from brunch when I came here."}
{"text":"With it's clean style and quality tea, qualiTea if you will, Arnold's Tea is helping to bring some much needed class to the North Side. But my question is, who is Arnold and why did he want to show Pittsburgh that he could build a tea house? Did he actually like tea that well? Did he decide that other people liked tea that well? Was it some experiment to see how well he could excel in a venture like this? It seems like it will always be a mystery to me. He wasn't even there when I was there. It was just two ladies working. Which brings me to some new questions. Who were they and why were they so dedicated to making me my rooibos iced tea?  

I will never know the answers to Arnold's secrets. What I Do know is that he created a very nice environment in which to relax or work while enjoying the tea he is offering. Also he created a very nice selection of tea to enjoy while sitting on a massive leather couch in his wood-laden parlor. I see a bright future for the North Side and it looks a lot like Arnold's Tea."}
{"text":"What a great experience! My maid of honor planned an afternoon tea at this place and it was just perfect. First, I love the decor and openness of this cafe. The wood tables and the brick walls and the inviting couch make for what looks to be a great place to meet friends or get work done. The staff was so pleasant making sure we had everything we needed. They set up a large round table for us all to partake in high tea. The tea selection was great, but the food they brought out stole the show. The tiered risers held our many currant scones, mini sandwiches, and variety of desserts. Every thing I tried was so delicious. We left feeling so full and happy that we spent the afternoon there. 

I can't wait to go back for another experience trying one of their other meals and another adventurous tea!"}
{"text":"SETTING
Extremely spacious with an earthy feel. Wooden floors, wooden chairs and tables. Mostly small tables for two. There is a couch/coffee table in front of a fireplace and larger table in the back. Free wifi. 

This review is mostly for Arnold's atmosphere, since I was here to do some work. This place just opened, so it was not crowded at all. A great thing for me, but I'm sure they will get busier one word gets out. Shhh! 

I almost had the whole place to myself! For now, the non-busy and spacious feel of Arnold's Tea is what makes this establishment special. That and the soft smooth jazz (I love me some sultry sax and laidback jams) playing in the background. Exactly what I needed.

DRINKS
I had the \"Arnold on the green\" which was green tea and lemonade. I liked how light and refreshing it was. Not too sweet and exactly how I imagined it would taste like. They also have a selection of sandwiches and pastries. On the back wall is a shelf of jars with tea leaves where you could buy tea leaves that ranged from your typical ones to the more exotic.

IMPRESSIONS
I would come back to study and do work here. Again, the big open space and jazz music sealed the deal for me. You would never see me studying at Starbucks, Crazy Mocha, or the other chains because they are the complete opposite--crowded and noisy. Instead of sophisticated jazz, I hear unsophisticated gossip and obnoxious laughter. On repeat. Worst playlist ever. 

Arnold's is the antithesis, and a small business. I respect that. Despite my desire to keep this place hush hush, so I can have this place to myself again, I encourage you to check it out if you need a place to lounge and get some work done."}
{"text":"I have been in to Arnold's Tea twice.  Both times, it has been a good experience with a peaceful ambiance and enjoyable tea.  The first time I had a peach apple cobbler iced tea, and a few months later I returned to try a vanilla black tea latte.  The first time I also tried a brownie, which was large and filling.  However, I have never tried any of the sandwiches or other lunch food, and I'm not sure if I will... they seem a little expensive for what they are.  But it's worth a trip out just for the tea and the atmosphere.  Despite how open the space is, it still manages to have a cozy feeling, and the service is friendly."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful addition to East Ohio Street! Very comfortable and stylish furniture, fantastic  selection of teas. The sandwiches look good and taste great. We sprawled in the sunny window seat with pots of Blood Orange tea and delicious coffee cakes. We stayed longer than planned because the space is so inviting and the service is so friendly and accomodating. Could be New York or Chicago but no, it's the NorthSide!
Now we have a place to hang-out."}
{"text":"Back home for the holidays and checking out all the new neighborhood places. I love that this business is black owned. They have a vast variety of teas and I decided to get the matcha chai tea latte. They have about five different varieties of chai which I thought was interesting. There are many teas to choose from and they also offer a good menu. The space is very big a nice place to come and study or do work. My sister wanted to rent it for her bridal shower and they offer that. The only thing I would say is they should give an explanation of the different types of teas maybe in a smaller brochure. My sister who works at teavana said they used a lot of tea than is needed so they could save more money by using less. They also had honey and other items from local businesses. Other wise the service was great. It did take a long time to get my order but it was busy I won't knock them for that ;-)"}
{"text":"Do not waste your time coming here! The food is not good and the service is even worse. The girls that work behind the counter are extremely rude! I was rushed and talked down to when I wasn't sure how to order. What's worse than the service is the time you have to wait to get your items! I waited over 10 minutes to get an iced chai latte, 10 minutes!!! When I finally got the latte is was by far the worst I've had!"}
{"text":"This is such a hidden gem on E. Ohio Street. I love the relaxed, rustic, inviting atmosphere. They have so many flavors of tea that will make you come back for more. When I came I got a Pear Arugula Salad. It was incredible. The champagne pear vinaigrette dressing was like icing on a cake. It was honestly the most exciting salad I've ever eaten-- and let's face it, salads are kind of boring."}
{"text":"I got a mint iced tea here as well as the lavande one. I think both were a bit too sweet for my taste, especially the lavande one. Not only was the lavande too sweet but it also had way too much lime in it which was clashing with the lavender flavor."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a place to grab breakfast, lunch or a quick drink, check this place out! Everything is fresh and made to order. I enjoy the atmosphere inside - comfortable enough to relax and read a book - but I often get my order to go as too often I eat at the office. 

Anyone working on the north side (I work by the river near PNC Park) knows our lunch selection is limited. I really encourage to try Arnold's Tea for lunch as it's only a ten minute walk away. Great alternative to walking downtown, plus you're supporting local!"}
{"text":"Ooohhh my gosh!!! We just passed by this place randomly, and we're shocked by how awesome this tea is!! 

They have a bunch of different options of loose leaf tea available, and they of course offer hot and iced teas. 

We got the blood orange tea lemonade as well as a peach apple coddler iced tea. THEY WERE SO GOOD!! I definitely recommend the peach and apple coddler, I'm probably coming back just to get this one again. 

The decor inside is very nice, and they even had a little game of tic tac toe you can play. It's really cute!

Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Spent the day at Arnold's tea getting some work done. I had the peach apple cobbler tea (delicious) and a slice of lemon ponied cake. The shop was spacious and quiet, making it an excellent place for meetings and getting work done. This is definitely my go to spot next time I'm in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Wonderful tea shop with a great calming atmosphere. It is a small, independently owned business, started by a woman after she retired. I love when someone makes their dream a reality! The menu is pretty large with lots of sandwiches and baked goods. 

I had an iced caramel tea latte, which was delicious. My husband had a chocolate chai with almond milk and a PB&C sandwich, which he loved. And my sister had an Arnold on the Green that she said was very good.

It is worth the trip to support a small business, but also because the tea is just lovely! It also worth the (short) wait for the tea to steep, because it gives you a few minutes to enjoy the relaxing setting. :)"}
{"text":"Wonderful, relaxing atmosphere. The Arnold Palmer transports me back to Carolina and the food and service are always great."}
{"text":"I had a business meeting that I had to make happen on Monday morning.  The person I was meeting suggested Arnold's Tea.

Not knowing what to expect, I got there early.  What a gem!  The place is absolutely beautiful.  The space was much larger than I had expected, and with all the beautiful woodwork, it was just beautiful.

I am a chai tea drinker - and was happy to find all kinds of flavors - vanilla, masala, chocolate...and a few others.  I went with vanilla (and was happy to find it was decaf!).  it was phenomenal!   I don't typically drink every ounce, but i couldn't wait to drink every ounce, it was so good!

The space has free wifi to use that worked beautifully.  The staff is friendly and helpful.    Be aware - they don't accept tips.  

I would go here 100 times over before I hit up a chain!  Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"First time at Arnold's today and it is a great addition to East Ohio St. They clearly know their teas and what I really liked was when the tea-rista brought the tea over to me -- which was a nice gesture itself -- she let me know how much longer to keep the tea bag in the mug. I usually have no idea how long the bag has been in when I order tea. For those who are not into hot tea, they have a wide selection of iced teas, as well as coffee too. They did a really nice job on renovating the space, giving a fairly large space a warm and inviting ambiance."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area, and I immediately had to try this place out. The staff are friendly, and give great suggestions. I had the Hammertime sandwich and the Peach Apple Cobbler cold specialty tea blend. This place is definitely a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Delightfully helpful staff, but NOT a tea shop. More like a sandwich shop that serves some tea. People who love tea will know what I mean. 

Atmosphere is not cozy come sip sit and relax, more like get some lunch with tea, on your quick one hour break from work.

Prices are good and they do have a selection of loose tea as well as by the cup. I thought the selection pretty standard (hibiscus, Earl grey, golden monkey, gunpowder) but seriously lacking for a place calling itself a tea shop. (Only a single Pu-erh and it was not pure but mixed with chocolate orange) 

Meh."}
{"text":"Was walking down the street one day and stumbled upon Arnold's, all I can say is that I am glad.  The first thing I noticed was the space and the decor, both pleasing. I have enjoyed many teas and sandwiches since then, and hope the Arnold's continues to expand on the menu."}
{"text":"I decided to check this place out since it has been a while since I've been on the North-side. There is street parking along with a parking lot on a diagonol behind it. All parking is metered wherever you park.

Came inside. The atmosphere was \"homey\" with wooden tables and chairs. In an adjacent room there is a sofa and table to relax. The place wasn't at all busy for lunch so I decided to order the pear arugula salad. I asked the counter person regarding getting a cold tea since it was an unusually warm day. She told me that all of their teas can be made cold upon request. There was one that interested me which was called \"Peach apple cobbler tea.\" I asked about it and was told  that it has that flavor to it along with cider mixed in. Seeing fall had arrived I opted for that one.

She also explained to me that my salad would come with bacon, pecans, and Gorgonzola cheese which I said was fine. The dressing used is a pear vinaigrette that also contains the same cheese. I went to sit down to wait for my order and observed that they have takeout, a wall full of various teas and huge desserts or pastries available for purchase.

Finally she explained that they have a reward program via Perka where if you purchase a total of 6 teas then your 7th one would be free. This is a good reward program for anyone who frequents the place.

I got my salad and it was indeed delicious! I had ordered the large size of the cobbler tea and found it just as good with enough cider in it that I didn't need any added sugar. They also specialize in peach lemonades for cold drinks and have a great assortment. The salad was served on a regular dish along with an actual fork and knife on a tray. Once finished there is an area where you can throw away your trash and place the tray and utensil as well as the dish in a separate area.

Prices are reasonable whether you are ordering a salad, sandwich, or pastry to go with your tea of choice. This place is another neighborhood gem. It sits close to Allegheny General hospital on East Ohio St so it is best to come in the off hours. Am looking forward to my next visit to try a hot tea and perhaps one of their pastries."}
{"text":"Really great quality tea. They also had lavender, a personal favorite that is not always easy to find. There are a good amount of food options and the environment is very cozy. Highly recommended if you're looking for a nice place to study with a cup or pot of tea. Came in on a Saturday afternoon and there were plenty of tables open with outlets nearby."}
{"text":"I walked into Arnold's today for the first time during my work lunch break. I was immediately taken wth the rustic decor and comfortable seating. The space is divided in two (without feeling separate). One side is the cafe where you order teas, lunch, small bites, etc. This side also has tables for dining. The other side boasts a comfy sofa with side chairs and tables. 
The tea selection is immense without being overwhelming. I absolutely love the ginger twisted tea (iced) and the BLT was yummy too. 
If you're a tea snob or casual tea drinker, this place serves your needs."}
{"text":"I absolutely love it here. I live in the area and walk over at least once every two weeks. The store itself is extremely cozy. It gives off a rustic vibe due to the fact that it has a wooden countertop, wooden floors, and wooden tables & chairs as well. The staff is always friendly and more than willing to help. They are reasonably priced - and I love supporting a local business. 
Now on to the teas - I love the cold teas here and have tried the Yerba Redhead, the EoJito, and the Peach Apple Cobbler. They all have real pieces of fruit in them - lemons, limes, raspberries, and/or peaches, and I love them all. 
The food is fantastic as well, they have many sandwiches, salads, and smoothies! I always get the EO Beef and it's amazing every time. I would highly recommend checking this place out if you are in the area and want to try it!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy this place exists. It's exactly what I want for the North Side (and a little jealous it's not what we have in my neighborhood, Dormont). An inviting coffee shop with plenty of seating, and best of all fantastic food and drinks. 

While it's not a full bakery (they have cookies and scones), they do have a ton of really fantastic sandwiches and salads, made to order. I'm absolutely OBSESSED with the pear and chicken salad, that's mixed with fresh arugula, pecans and goat cheese. I can't not get it every time I'm in. But I have no doubt the other food items are killer too.. and once the summer ends I'll be forced to get something else seasonal. But that's not a bad thing!

I love tea, so this is just the spot for me. They freshly brew all their ice teas and this summer my go to has been the peach oolong iced tea, that they lightly sprinkle cinnamon on. They also have a variety of loose leaf teas to choose from for hot or cold choices. I can only imagine what I'll get obsessed with once the winter comes along!

The only gripe I have is that the service is on the slower side. If there's a line to order, it may take you a bit to get up to the front to order. The food, like I said, is made to order so it's not going to come out fast, but I wouldn't say it takes forever either. Just be prepared to wait about 15ish minutes. 

They have you covered on the wifi, so it's a great place for meetings and getting work done too. Like I need an excuse to come here though... I'm already hooked!"}
{"text":"Arnold's has been such a wonderful addition to E. Ohio street! They have an awesome selection of teas but I mostly come for the delicious sandwiches! The owner, Verna, is so sweet and you can tell she truly loves the neighborhood and wants to provide excellent service. The space has a really cool vibe and I've seen lots of events here. I would highly recommend the Happy Turkey club, the Pear Arugula Salad, or the breakfast sandwich!! They are all seriously delicious. This is an awesome community spot on the north side and I am so happy to have it in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"This place is so lovely - what a beautiful space and awesome tea shop!  I'm so excited that my friends introduced me to a spot in the nearby neighborhood.  The place is bright, spacious with comfortable seating, exposed brick walls and a really great atmosphere.  They have a great selection of hot and cold tea and coffee beverages as well as baked goods and some great sandwiches, soup, and salads.  I love that everything is freshly made and I love to support a small business in my community.  I had the \"Just salad\" which is a generous portion of mixed greens with tomatoes, olives, and some shredded cheese (you can get it without) and I had it with their delicious balsamic vinaigrette dressing!  I also had a chai latte which was perfectly steeped and had the perfect amount of spices.  I can't wait to go back for breakfast some weekend, and spend more time just hanging out at this wonderful local business!"}
