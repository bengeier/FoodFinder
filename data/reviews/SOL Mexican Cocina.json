{"text":"Sol in Scottsdale Quarter is consistently excellent.  The waitstaff are all very nice, but our favorites are three brothers who work there--Israel, Rodrigo, and Armando.  (If you go for brunch, they're usually there. ) . They remember the drinks we like, are super fun and nice to our 3 children, and are all around happy people.  The food is great!  Our favorites are the crab stack appetizer (amazing crab meat with spices, mango, jalapeno, and avocado with a lemon avocado oil), the wet carnitas burrito (really, it's a GREAT burrito!), and the quinoa is an unusual and sophisticated side with interesting flavors.  The short ribs barbacoa are a great GF option.   Our kids (one of whom is a VERY picky eater) like everything they've tried, and Sol has no problem splitting an adult meal between kids.  As for the TEQUILA, it's a great selection if you're an aficionado, and upscaled everyday margs if you're not.  I love the frozen margarita with fresh muddled berries (they have all kinds).  All drinks are made from scratch and to order, but it's worth the short wait.  If you love mimosas, ask for the FroMo, which is orange juice and prosecco, mixed with frozen margarita.....DELICIOUS and yummy at any meal!  Brunch is served Sat/Sun, and it's a lovely menu all on its own, although you can order from the regular menu as well.  This is one of our favorite restaurants, for guests, date night, family dinner......all of it."}
{"text":"Excellent evening at Sol Mexican Cucina...  Host staff was friendly, we gave them a cell number and received a text within five minutes to alert us our table was ready.  Kind of a shame we didn't have the chance to do any window shopping in this upscale outdoor mall.  Our servers were friendly, informative and helpful with suggestions.  They introduced us to Baja style cooking and we were in for a treat.  This is not your typical Mexican restaurant.    We all loved their special Guacamole Sol.  Goat cheese, mango.... Yummy twist and so very delicious!  The Hot and Raw Tropical Ceviche was also delish.  We came in on a Taco Tuesday (live music, street tacos) and ordered fish and shrimp tacos (both yum) and enchiladas (everyone in our party joined the Clean Plate Club).    We ended the evening by ordering all the desserts on the menu (four) and sharing!  All were a hit with the exception of the Margarita Cake, (it was doused in tequila).  Duh. Should have guessed.  Oh well.     We loved the Nachos Dulces, the Banana Dark Chocolate Bread Pudding and the deep fried banana dish, Bananoli. Way yum, we gobbled them up.  Can't wait for our next trip to Scottsdale, Arizona.  Spring Training, swimming, sun and Sol Mexican Cucina."}
{"text":"Great servers, the one that helped us was Albert, great ambiance. Not many places offer to customize your food, they make it from scratch. Oh... I almost forgot, the food is great!"}
{"text":"This restaurant = a great experience. Everything about this place is fabulous. The server was extremely attentive, the food was fresh and delicious, and the intimate yet casual ambiance is to die for.  ENTREE  For starters, they do put a rather unique spin on the typical 'chips and salsa' that's brought out to you in the beginning of most Spanish restaurants. They bake corn tortillas until their crisp and serve that with an interesting array of dips: black bean, salsa, and a tray of salt, limes, and hot sauce to stir in.  I ordered a simple entree of carne asada tacos and black beans; my meal was yummy and filling, and I even had leftovers. Beware of spicy when choosing your dish, however. My coworker kept complaining about how hot her meal was (beer battered fish burrito). I don't know if she has sensitive taste buds, or if it was really spicy.. so proceed with caution.  DESSERT  They have a wide variety of entrees, but unfortunately only have 3 sweet options. I'm a BIG dessert person, so it was a little disappointing but what the heck. I ordered the flan and it was scrumptious, incredible, delectable, etc.. all that good stuff. My coworker who complained about the spiciness called our dessert 'sexy'. So I guess sexy is the best way to describe it's caramel drizzle and chocolate bark yumminess.  AMBIANCE/SERVICE  The waiter was incredibly attentive and friendly. He answered all questions we had, and gave speedy and praiseworthy service. The manager even came up to our table and made conversation; that, to me, is always a plus. The background music helped add to the overall appeal to the restaurant.   I would definitely go back to SOL. Maybe tomorrow.."}
{"text":"Great food, great service!  Not you traditional Mexican fare, which may be a hang up for some. They feature specialty Tacos as their focus, and they are fabulous. Upscale, nice atmosphere, would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Came here the other night with a friend for dinner. Garrett was our server, who was outstanding, very knowledgeable and personable.  Service was prompt and every employee we interacted with that night was also very friendly and accommodating.    Great taco Tuesday specials, live solo band that plays some nights, great bar area and an amazing outside patio with wrap around bar.  Food is delicious, haven't had one entrée that I haven't liked.  Started off with the Coconut Calamari for the appetizer, and The Pollo Con Rajas is absolutely delicious!  Our server and general manager of the restaurant talked us in to trying the crème brulee for dessert... TO DIE FOR! You must try.    All in all.. Great food, Great service, Great people :)"}
{"text":"Tired of regular Mexican food...... Go explore Sol Mexican Cocina located in the Scottsdale Quarter. The restaurant is wonderfully warm and inviting with an open concept. In fact, I love to invite my guests to taste \"modern Mexican cuisine\" which is flavorful and tasty. The quality of food and service have been outstanding each time I was there. If you are fortunate to be helped by Francisco and his team, you will enjoy your meal even more so. They are extremely knowledgeable, friendly, and attentive to your needs and wishes. Oh! Let's not forget the Margaritas! They have a great variety and they are delicious!"}
{"text":"I wasn't to happy with this place.  Location is great in the Scottsdale Quarter, but the food was bland.  I have had better burritos at roadside stands.  This place definitely misses the mark in Mexican food.  They base their whole menu around the street tacos. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing, but from a restaurant that looks upscale it didn't deliver. We may come back to this place but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"So we were exited to eat a Sol during happy hour. Website states happy hour as \"weekdays\" 3-6 pm. Imagine our surprise when upon arrival we wait for 4-5 minutes while the waitress is chatting it up with a customer and won't seat us. She then tells us she knows nothing about happy hour specials but it is taco Tuesday at 4 pm (it's now 3:40) I show her the website and she says she'll pass it on. She did bring us chips and salsa but makes us wait 25 minutes until she will bring guacamole and tacos. Good food terrible service!"}
{"text":"I ordered the chorizo and potato scramble at lunch and it was amazing! The complementary chips were also great as well as the bean dip they came with. Alberto, my server, was very accommodating and helpful. I will definitely come again!!! FIVE STARS!"}
{"text":"Would never eat in this restaurant again.  Lousy food and the service was worse.  Took a friend there who came in from Florida.  Our friend ordered a cup of soup before dinner and it came out in only what I can describe as something not much bigger than a thimble.  Then the waitress tells us that this is their sampler so our friend ordered a bowl of soup.  It was huge.  We laughed so hard.  The food was supposed to be Mexican.  But having spent considerable time at some of the best restaurants in Mexico, the food here would be laughable if it wasn't so bad.  No flavor, nothing.  Really not good.  And the waitress.  Talk about attitude.  Kept calling our friend \"missie\" or \"me lady\".  Seriously?  Let me give you a hint.  You are a waitress, not the Queen.  Being a waitress or waiter is a tough job so we go out of our way to be nice.  Not a job that I would want.  But, your job is to be nice, give good service, etc.  The wait staff here needs serious traiining.  I was watching one of the waiters put plates on the tables.  He would neatly lay out the plates and then to position, he would put his hand in the middle of the plate, palm down, to shift if around, to put it in place.  Not sure where his hand had been before placing the plates, but what a turn-off.  Hopefully he just didn't come from the bathroom, or worse.  This place is nothing more than an embarassment.  So sorry to have taken our out of town friend to this place.  If it lasts a year I would be surprised."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is fun and the service is good.   The menu is a tad complicated.  Some of the menu items are quite unique and interesting.. Allow time to really read and ask questions.  This can be challenging if you are visiting with friends you have not seen for a while.   Some portions, like the octopus, are really small and cannot be shared if you want more than one tiny bite.   Parking is easy.  The noise level in the dining room is high but better on the patio or even in the bar.  The house margarita is sweet, the \"Skinny Marg\" is too sour.  We need something in between please.."}
{"text":"Ok. Been here dozens of times. The last 3 times the service was absolutely horrible. Last time we waited 20 minutes and finally asked for a waiter. This time we left. 25 minutes and no waiter. During the 25 minutes, several tables were seated after us. Half had a waiter come over and the other half were looking around in amazement just like us. The service has never been very good but now it's so bad we won't go back. It's a shame because the tacos, while expensive are solid."}
{"text":"They sat us and no one ever showed up to take our order. Even asked for someone to tell a waiter we were there. Nothing.  Manager reached out to offer apologies and comp some food.  Good to know he is aware of yelp reviews and takes it seriously.  We will go back and give them another shot."}
{"text":"Excited to come to SOL for my birthday, unfortunately the service was incredibly slow and we had to go ask the bartender for the majority of things we needed, we also had to clear our own plates to another unoccupied table because our server was no where to be found. To make matters worse when we went to leave another server near the front of the restaurant rudely  complained to us as we walked passed her that \"there is another exist for a reason!\". Nothing like a little harassment for using the front door to top off of the evening...."}
{"text":"Had Saturday brunch on the patio and was surprised to see that it was pretty empty. Food and drinks were great, and the staff was very friendly, but it took about 20 mins just to get a few mimosas out and there were only 4-5 other tables there. Might try it again for dinner but I'm afraid to see how long it takes for food and drinks to come out when the restaurant is actually full. So 1 star off only because of the drink wait time."}
{"text":"Amanda, our server, was the best part of this horrible meal!  Overrated, overpriced, over complicated food!  My salad was anything but colorful, the lettuce was yellow!!!  You are better off going to filibertos.  Sol is another North Scottsdale fancy version of food that should be kept fresh and simple."}
{"text":"Great!  Loved the margaritas, street corn and guacamole.  Pretty much everything was great!  Awesome tequila selection and wonderful service.  My new favorite Scottsdale restaurant."}
{"text":"We were here last week and had a fantastic experience thanks to our waiter, Arnoldo. He was fabulous and the food was terrific. Arnoldo was extremely attentive and although we had a large party, he took care of everyone's individual needs. We had one member with a strong aversion to cilantro and he made sure none of her food had any in it. It was a great dinner and we will be sure to return."}
{"text":"One star for food only. Service is horrible. I waited 10 minutes for someone to even acknowledge I was there. Then a different waiter came to say, \"I'll be taking care of you\".  However, he did very little. I told him I was ready to order and he looked at me and just walked off. Then I went to the restroom and the bus staff was clearing my table when I returned. Took my chips and salsa and my water, and my beer.  I'm told him I wasn't finished but he had already put the remainder of 2 of the 3 tacos I ordered in his bucket. He tried to put them back, but it was too late. Manager came by to ask if he could do anything and then comped my beer only. I would expect more."}
{"text":"Was looking for a place to have some guacamole/margaritas while on vacation in the Scottsdale area, and found Sol to be an excellent place to consume both!  The restaurant itself has a nice, open space and feel to it (seems to be common with the places I visited in Arizona). Upon sitting down, received a bowl of baked corn tortillas with different spices and salsa/seasonings/hot sauce which was a nice departure from standard Tostitos and salsa that restaurants will sometimes default to.  Ordered a jalapeno margarita which was done right - just the right amount of spice, and didn't confuse my senses or 'offend' my order. Some bars I've been to will think that they need to compensate against the fire of the jalapeno by adding extra sweetness - not here! When I order a jalapeno margarita, it's because I like things to be spicy and I like tequila. Sol seemed to understand this, and both were delivered to my satisfaction.  As for the guacamole, we ordered some tropical'ish variety - was feeling adventurous - and this came with goat cheese, sweet peppers, and goat cheese. This was a creamier and more savory version of the traditional, but complimented the saltiness and crispiness of the baked chips as well as I've ever tried. Only downside (of the whole meal, really) was that the guacamole wasn't mixed for us or made fresh at the table. That's probably being a little particular, but hey - when it's done like that, it really is the best.  Because I filled up on all of the other good stuff, I only had room for one taco, and I chose the fish. This was a good taco, not great or anything. The freshness and snap of the ingredients left a little to be desired - the fish was kind of bland, and the salsa/other toppings were just, ya know, good.   Didn't try any of the entrees or anything, so the review is from more of an appetizer/small plate/drink perspective, but Sol does a good job in this area all the same."}
{"text":"Quite frankly, I was expecting an average meal based on previous reviews however they hit the ball out of the park on Thursday night, May 9th.  The atmosphere was lively, the service (Mike) was excellent and the SOL guac appetizer and meal was outstanding.  I would rate the meal and experience a \"5 star plus\" and I'm not an easy grader.  Well done SOL, especially Mike's kind attention to our table!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times.  It's got a great vibe and atmosphere that keeps me coming back.  The food is pretty tasty as well.  This is not traditional Mexican food- it's Americanized so if you want \"authentic\" Mexican food go someplace else, Sol is not perfect, they definitely have plates that are stronger than others, and ones that could probably be removed, but overall, it's got a strong selection of good choices.    For appetizers, I recommend the chorizo queso, but ask for extra tostada chips to eat it with (they are their substitution for tortilla chips you normally receive at mexican restaurants) instead of the included corn tortillas.  Avoid the calamari and goat cheese apps... they are not worth it. Calamari is more like a fish stick than the typical rings commonly served.  Different- yes.  Better- no.   For entrees, any of the tacos will serve you well.  They haven't really disappointed me yet and although they are a bit on the expensive side, hey, it's N. Scottsdale, rent isn't cheap here.  Vampiro is a great one, so is El Jefe (shrimp and filet Mignon) I've also tried their chili relleno and I'd describe it as a \"healthy\" version of the normally deep-fried mexican variant.  It's stuffed with shrimp, rice, and veggies.  Tasty, and it'll certainly fill you up.  I believe it's baked.   Wait staff has always been pleasant; I dont recall any instances where they were rude to me or my guests.  I have sat and been served at the bar, on the patio, and inside the dining room.  When it gets busy, there is a little more time in-between check-ups on the table by the waiters, but that is not unreasonable.  I've flagged down a manager before when the waiter's time expired in my mind and was accommodated without hesitation or attitude.  I plan to keep coming back."}
{"text":"Loved everything about our SOL experience last night! Our server was fun and knew so much about the menu so he offered great suggestions for all of us. We had SOL Ceviche and Guacamole as an appetizer then some had vegetarian tacos (the butternut squash taco was my favorite!) and the Dads had the steak dish with some corn on the cobb side that everyone wanted more of.  I am looking forward to the opening of SOL in Denver so we can visit again! There were 8 of us at dinner and celebrating a birthday. Everyone loved their dinner and we had Birthday Nachos to top off the night!"}
{"text":"We've been to Scottsdale Quarter so many times I've lost count. Been to many of the restraunts there and Keirland. I can't believe we haven't been. In a sea of \"me too\" Mexican places in Scottsdale Sol stands out and is without question our new fav! Here's why, chips and salsa, they give two different kinds and unlike anything we've ever tasted super gourmet. The menu was extensive but we decided on the two tacos each and I got shrimp tacos that bursted with flavor. More than enough. The margaritas were incredible as well, not the same old tired sweet and sour mix that tastes like Sugar but real fruit juices that comes with the house. To top it off the service was truly amazing 90% of the wait staff and bar tenders in Scottsdale could learn a thing or two from Lauren and Clark.   What we thought we just be another ordinary night out turned into us finding our new favorite place. Thanks to Lauren and Clark for the amazing recommendations and experience. We'll be back soon to try some of the Clase Azul and Don Julio 1942."}
{"text":"I wish I could convey how delicious the Mexican corn is here. You will just have to try it for yourself. Amazing!!!! I also ordered the Taco Vampiro (carne asada) and the Shrimp Dorado taco. Both delicious as well. The food is a little on the pricey side but well worth it. Very flavorful and the meat was so tender. Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"In a word - \"Disappointed\". My wife and I chose Sol to meet another couple from out of town and hoped for the best despite reading some bad reviews. We live in North Scottsdale and eat out regularly but had not tried Sol despite frequenting the Quarter. We actually liked the interior space and design and the food was fair to good but that is where the positive feelings end. The service at this restaurant was appalling. Lets start with the bartenders who had the personalities of DMV employees. Even though we had reservations we were forced to wait at the bar for 10-15 minutes until our table was ready which wouldn't have been so bad without experiencing the cold and aloof attitudes of the bar staff. A smile and the word \"Enjoy!\" would go a long way folks. After being sat at our table we hoped things would improve but they got worse. Our server only understood how to take an order but obviously missed the days of training when you learn when to remove dishes and drink glasses. After 45 minutes of waiting for him or a busser to remove the finished plates and empty drink glasses and beer bottles of four adults we started handing them to the staff. Note to server...When someone orders another drink and you deliver a new drink without removing the old drink you have failed in your job. When you repeat this mistake several times with all four customers at your table you shouldn't HAVE a job. Our table looked so ridiculous after sitting for three hours with dirty plates and glasses you'd have thought they didn't have a dishwasher. The only reason we stayed as long as we did is because we had such good company with our out of town friends and decided to live with our choice of venue for the night. Our tab was well over $400 and nothing grinds a customer more than paying a lot for poor service. My advice to the owners would be to spend more time and money training your management and staff and less on your interior designer. People will come back because of great service and food at a dive, however most won't return to the hippest and swankiest place in town with bad service. There are too many other restaurants in town that are really making an effort for my patronage. It will be a long while before I give this place another try."}
{"text":"Solid ceviche  Went for a light lunch while Xmas shopping . . . am a fool for ceviche so had to try it. They had three types but I went with the traditional ($14) , which was a mix of yellowtail and ahi that day, with a little avocado on top.  Overall, very very good and fresh, went great with the homemade tostada chips and salsa.  Will try it again for happy hour or for dinner to check out the full menu."}
{"text":"Been here a few of times and really enjoyed the cuisine and atmosphere.  However, I would recommend getting a table in the back and not \"the high top\" tables near the entry way.  That area is congested, not very private, and the service traffic between the tables can cause problems, i.e., bumping into chairs/patrons, etc.  However, the food is fresh and I really enjoyed the chicken mole dish.  Spicy and flavorful.  The rest of party (of 4) also really enjoyed their selections.  Although the service has been spotty at times, the overall experience has been worth coming back for.  Good food."}
{"text":"I live Mexican food and eat it every chance I get.  This place is legit! We have eaten here twice during our visit and have not been disappointed.   The guacamole with goat cheese in it was very good but may not be for everyone. The Taco Vampario is delicious!  Lots of great flavor and cooked to perfection.  The taco Buffalado was good but didn't have the flavor hat the others did.  I also got the Goat Cheese Enchiladas with Carnitas on top and it was very, very good! The salsa verda is the best I've ever had!   My husband got the wet steak burrito with seasoned corn as one of his sides and loved it!    If you prefer average cheap Mexican restaurants this probably won't appeal to you due to the price; however if you like fresh ingredients and cooked well this is the place!   Service was five star; every server we interacted with was great.  Would love to have his restaurant in my city!"}
{"text":"First time visitor to Scottsdale, so obviously needed to find some delicious mexican food. Initially skeptical when a friend recommended this as I am not used to finding authentic mexican food in nicer restaurants back in Ohio(You've got a better chance with the food carts). Boy am I glad I didn't try and talk him out of it.  The hostess was incredibly accomodating as we had to switch our reservation multiple times to account for some unpredictability in our schedule. We were seated on arrival. The atmosphere is great, and the restaurant is beautifully decorated. The margaritas are absolutely delicious, among the best I've had.  They brought out whole, seasoned tostadas to the table in place of chips, and they were incredibly delicious. There seemed to be a black bean based salsa served warm and a more traditional salsa. Both were delcious.  We got the sol guacamole, and if you are coming here it is a must get. It has goat cheese (score) and mango in it and is a true explosion of flavors.  I had the Vampiro, the fish gubernador, and the bufaleda. The fish gubernador was the best fish taco i have ever had, bar none. Deliciously cooked and drizzled with a delcious tangy sauce, it allows the fish to be the main taste with a host of perfect complements.   My second favorite was the vampiro. It has a lot of kcik to it so be ready, but is quite delicious.  The service throughout was impeccable, and the manager even stopped by and chatted with us for 5 minutes.  Great experience and I can't wait to get back to Scottsdale and come here again"}
{"text":"Delicious fresh Mexican in a fun upbeat setting. This place was buzzing and fun. Fresh fish tacos and loved the guacamole."}
{"text":"This is the first time I have been here but it will not be the last. They have a spicy salsa that is hot but delicious and not for the wimps.  I had the pork carnitas and they were delicious.  Arnold was our server and he is excellent."}
{"text":"Went here while on vacation in phoenix. Had high hopes based on the menu and reviews, but overall was unimpressed. First, the staff and general vibe of the restaurant was that they were too cool / better than you. Service was really slow and not very friendly. Second, the food was average at best. Chips were stale, tacos were just ok, and drinks were overpriced. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Not even close to authentic mexican food. The guacamole was the only item that was decent other than that everything was bland. I would not go back there again. On top of that the food was WAY overpriced."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre and service here is pretty bad.  We waited ~15 minutes to be seated, which was odd since there were many open tables and it wasn't busy.  Hire more staff if this is an issue.  Also, the server was extremely slow and inattentive.  Our drinks would sit at the bar for a long time before another server would finally bring them to us (and it wasn't because our server was busy with other tables).  Here's a novel idea....if you give good service and pay attention to the customers, you'll get a larger gratuity and the restaurant will make more money!   We decided to pay the bill and go elsewhere to finish our dining experience. Definitely won't be returning."}
{"text":"Well, I sort of expected this from Scottsdale.....What can I say?  Very nice location with very nice outdoor area.  Greeted with smile, promptly seated, and immediate waiter contact.  Huge tortilla chips and salsa/black bean dip. Our waiter took his time and went over the menu with us.  We went for the Coconut Calamari as an appetizer. It was different, but different good, although we couldn't really taste coconut. Nice big crispy pieces with a creamy dipping sauce.  For entrees my wife went with the Hot & Spicy Ceviche. It was very nice and fresh, but still very simple. Served with sweet potato and beet chips, which were a bit salty.  I decided on a Shrimp Taco and Taco Vampiro as suggested by our waiter. They were pretty good, but I feel like the shrimp and the steak got lost in the mix of salsa, guacamole, and cheese. Just not what I am used to having eaten as some great Mexican Restaurants.  My wife ordered what was supposed to be a Pineapple-Serrano Margarita as we had a $5 off Coupon from our Yelp Check-In. It tasted like a simple Margarita. The Yelp deal is for a Don Julio Margarita which is some of the cheapest Tequila a bar will stock that isn't \"Well\" Tequila.  Our waiter said he'd see what he can do as this Margarita my wife wanted wasn't a Don Julio Margarita.  Now for the rough part! Not like the Cost was a mystery, but moreso a reminder of a mediocre meal that was pretty expensive.  Tacos were over $6(something I'd glady pay $3 for at a local taqueria) Ceviche/Calamari, well seafood is expensive. I understand.  The Pineapple-Serrano Margarita? $11.50+$1.50=$13 for a small margarita that was nothing special at all. My wife asked about the Yelp deal, he said he forgot. She also mentioned that it didn't even taste like pineapple-Serrano. He came back and had removed $5 and the $1.50(fruit upcharge) so Ok, $6.50 wasn't bad.  Not a place I'd go back to, and if you're looking for great Mexican food there are 100s of other choices out there."}
{"text":"like this place. I particularly like that it is NOT the typical Mexican refried beans, with blobs of cheese kind of Mexican place. Instead it seems to be more Southern Mexican food with Black beans (my favorite), and even things like \"Fried RIPE Plantains\" something you usually only find in Cuban or Salvadorean or Honduran restaurants. So thumbs up for this place. And the Margaritas are great. Just not a huge fan of the high chair tables that make up most of the restaurant. Doesn't make it very convenient to go there with young kids. but they DO have some regular tables with normal chairs too. so if you bring kids, make sure you reserve one of the lower/normal tables ahead of time."}
{"text":"This place is an amazing little secret hidden in the sea of restaurants we call the Scottsdale quarter.   It is a \"type\" of mexican food that is hard to explain. It's not authentic \"the hole in the wall type place where you're afraid to use the restrooms) , it's not fresh mex (the type of Mexican food people who don't like mexican food eat) but we did come up with a name : MODERN mexican. It's decor is Spanish style decked out in tequila bottles, comfy tables, and an AMAZING patio with lounge seating.    The food is awesome.  I highly recommend the coconut calamari,  the gabernador taco (no way can I pronounce that properly) the grilled sweet corn, ANNND beer battered shrimp taco's. The one thing i didn't care for in my many trips was the tortilla soup because it was OVERLOADED with raw red onion to the point i felt it was inedible. The service has always been great and the drinks are wonderful.  Happy hour menu: the prices are not very \"happy\" but rather great recommendations of their specialities. Other than those few things the food, service and atmosphere keep me coming back again & again!"}
{"text":"Some of the best street tacos in town! I've eaten at this location twice and the one in Newport twice, its about time they opened one up in AZ. The hand crafted margaritas are amazing - jalapeno cucumber margarita and frozen beer are my personal favorites!"}
{"text":"My social analytics company was in Scottsdale for a giant restaurant conference at the Westin up the street. We wanted to whisk a few of our clients and colleagues away for a few hours to enjoy a few margaritas and goodies. I am SO glad we had our party at SOL Mexican Cocina. We worked with Sharon who fixed us right up with a specialty taco bar, amazing apps like calamari with this amazing sauce and all the cucumber jalapeño margaritas we could handle -- everything was AWESOME. The servers was so nice, funny and helpful...I think I may have even friended a few on Facebook during the night - LOL! It was a Tuesday night so they had a guitarist playing cool tunes. Deborah, the executive chef at SOL, even took the time to introduce herself to our group and made us feel right at home. I just can't say enough wonderful things about this place -- if you're looking to grab a party room while you're in Scottsdale, or hell just dinner...I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Our waiter Arnoldo was very nice and knowledgeable. The food and drinks are fantastic. I am not a fan of tequila and tried the jalapeño cucumber margarita and it was ahmazing great flavor! We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"The food was ery average not as good as you would expect. The drinks were pretty delish and quite strong so no complaints there. If you are looking for atmosphere and are indifferent as to how great the food is this is a great place, however, if you love food as much as me I would much rather go to Blancos- their tacos are 100 times better."}
{"text":"Good solid  nouveau Mexican food with a Sonoran / Baja bend.. The prices are on the high end for the quality of food... This is Mexican food and Arizona.. The price point ought to be $10.00 per person plus Drinks and extras. My advice.. You'll love this place.. But only as well as a really authentic Mexican food Downtown or on Central.. You'll get more bang for your buck at some place like Los Dos Molinos.. I like their South Central Location"}
{"text":"A tad pricey (hey, it's Scottsdale), but Sol Mexican Cocina really delivers. We were there on a Sunday night, and it wasn't hugely busy. That being said, though, the atmosphere, service and food were first class. The house margarita was excellent, as were the Gubernador tacos, the shrimp tacos and the ceviche. On top of that, the noise level was well within tolerable limits, meaning we could carry on a conversation with our dining companions without shouting. Finally, our server was very attentive without being intrusive. Overall, a terrific dining experience"}
{"text":"Carne Asada was great, very accommodating to young children. They bring the heat, if you want it, but you can cool it off with tasty margaritas."}
{"text":"Not a big 5 star guy. This is a 5 star place. I thought the service was outstanding from the start. We brought our 1 year old and she had a blast there, and the wait staff LOVED interacting with her. They could teach the \"industry\" people something, the ones who shun children at their tables.  The server had so much great information and recommendations, down to the food. We got the quesadillas and a couple of their burritos. Everything tasted fantastic. This is probably the best Mexican I've had in the valley. I will say it's not cheap, but the atmosphere and being in the upscale Scottsdale Quarter justifies the price. Great job with this restaurant."}
{"text":"I had the most amazing experience this past weekend at the restaurant, I went with my family and friends and our server Alberto gave us such a great help deciding what to eat and the way he talked us trough the menu was very specific and knowledgable. Alberto's customer service was right on point and very friendly that he made us feel at home, we will  definitely come back very soon."}
{"text":"The food was good, but there wasn't much variety on the menu. Nearly everything was a taco... taco with shrimp, taco with beef asado, taco with pork...  Lettuce and tomato is pretty shy, and you also have to order guacamole on the side. Otherwise you get an avocado puree instead. I wouldn't turn away an invite to eat there, but I wouldn't crave it."}
{"text":"Food was ok . Service a little slow."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a whim for a late lunch / early dinner. Everything was delicious! The guacamole SOL is different but exceptional! My friend had the Kobe skirt steak and raved about the flavors. The pork carnita tacos were yummy, but my favorite was the \"Dorado\" (shrimp taco). Holden was a great server as well!"}
{"text":"How do you not have salsa or chips.?! Wtf And when offered \"bean dip\" as a replacement that never comes.... Then be told they still have none when other tables are being served. Super salty food as well... Seek elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Kassandra provides stellar service every time! I always enjoy coming in and enjoying some of the best Mexican food in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Our waiter was great however, the food was just eh. I have been there before and it was good. We ordered the guacamole and there couldn't have been more then a half of an avocado. The portion was so small. There was no taste to it. We asked for the spiciest one and we had to add a ton of salt to it to even taste anything. The spicy slaw was bland, not spicy at all. To top it off, we both have some stomach issues today. That was the only thing we ate yesterday so I am wondering if something was up. I will try it again at some point. Maybe it was just an off day."}
{"text":"Sangria sangria oh try the sangria, good ambiance, service food was great.  Date night or Girls Day Time Out.  Good spot."}
{"text":"I had the odd coincidence of going to this restaurant two times in one week ..and I am not sad about it. Firstly, they did good by being located in Scottsdale quarter, full marks on location. Full marks on ambiance inside , full marks on service. Now on to the main thing- food. A couple of things are highly recommended- the salsa, dips, guac...al good. I absolutely loved the ceviche sol and shrimp cevice. Very fresh and an absolute explosion of flavors in your mouth. I liked it so much on a cold winter night, I can only imagine what it would be like having this in the summers. In the entrees, I loved the fish pibil and shrimp chile relleno.  And now the not so good news- the desserts. I tried two , the creme brulee and the bread pudding....sadly not up to the mark. But overall, I recommend."}
{"text":"We are weekenders in Scottsdale, and every time we come, Sol is our go to! The prices are great. The service is great, and the micheladas.... AMAZING! (That may be the one reason we can't stay away!) can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Everything's really tasty here, especially the cocktails.  I would say everything's a little overpriced though.  But it's north Scottsdale, so what do you expect. As mentioned in other reviews, the vampire taco is legit.  I also liked the blackberry ginger margarita.  Unless you like REALLY spicy food, you might avoid the viper taco."}
{"text":"American Fare is dominated by MEAT. I grew up eating meat and still consume other mammals, avians, and our friends in the sea on occasion. However after my recent learnings of the industries that fuel my beloved bacon mushroom cheeseburger I have decided a change is needed!  Personally, I call it an aware-a=tarian.  Anyhow, what I am getting at is that going out to eat, being primarily an eater of plants is like going to a fast food restaurant and asking for a water cup. Never Satisfied!   Instead of being attentive to the fact that you want to eat plants, the vegetarian options are usually a bland house salad with sponge flavored tomatoes, and cabbage that would be better suited as a packing material than food.   This isn't the case at Sol. I am not sure of their vegetable sourcing but everything tasted fresh, and of origin from some type of soil. In addition we had an excellent waiter from Chicago via Croatia, who's name I will refrain from butchering. He was attentive, knowledgable, polite and more than helpful with my friends 17 month old. We were there this Saturday, late morning and there was also a brunch offering.   Sweet potato tacos were yummy, as was the veggie burrito as were the mushroom and poblano tacos. Also, I was talking to the waiter about the vampiro* taco and he brought one of those out as well. Very good stuff. The chips and salsa were fairly boss like too, being made of tostadas with some seasoning on them. Salsas were fresh and unique but not weird.   Only negative about this place was the host that seated us was definitely a bit of a control freak. He didn't appreciate the fact that we wanted to move tables to accommodate my friends baby. I get that we are in North Scottsdale, and you're not catering to 17 month olds, we get it... But babies are made in DC Ranch too Mr  middle aged snobby host, so be nice.   Now I was here on a Saturday morning and it was fairly slow. I could really see this place being capable of being full of more material seeking individuals than myself, but to each their own. With that being said I hardly EVER dine out in the 'Dale, but again this was not an awful experience at all!  Also our server was phenomenal and that makes all the difference. Peace out yelpers."}
{"text":"This is a great new mexican restaurant in the quarter that has fresh healthy and tasteful decor. The staff is very knowledgable. I had great organic margarita and black bean sweet potato taco. It was perfect! It has outdoor patio seating as well and  nice bar very classy!"}
{"text":"My wife and I came here twice for the happy hour and the tacos. The $3 Mimosas were amazing and the staff was awesome. Props to Manager Jason Goetz for comping our meal because 1. There was a hair in our Guacamole and 2. A fly flew in my wifes champaigne. Phenomenal service. I ended up tipping the waitress the entire amount of our tab. Will be back again soon."}
{"text":"We went in for dinner on a Saturday night. The hostess was a bit rude but not anything I couldn't ignore. We were promptly seated and our server was very friendly and especially knowledgeable about the menu and drinks. He sold us specialty cocktails we wouldn't have normally ordered and they rocked! The tacos we ordered were very good. We had the shrimp tacos and the filet mignon tacos also the sweet potato tacos were great. I really love the black bean salsa they give you with chips. I recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a change of pace in north Scottsdale."}
{"text":"We went on a Friday evening. Busy with a half hour wait to get a table indoors. We therefore opted for the outdoor seating. We had battered beer shrimp and fish tacos, and quesadillas. As he waited for the food, we munched on chips with salsa. Overall- food was reasonable. Not great, but not bad. The service was good. We wanted to split the bill amongst us 3, and they had no issue doing so. Overall-not bad!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and great food! I didn't care for their charred tortilla chips, but the food and drinks were great and the servers are nice and efficient. I recommend the shrimp taquitos for sure. Great enchiladas too! They had live music that was nice too. Will definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"Alberto was an excellent server and recommended some great meals.  We had chorizo queso and the skinny margarita in addition to the shrimp tacos. Yum!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service from our waiter Arnoldo! The bean dip was mouth watering."}
{"text":"We went there with high expectations but we're very disappointed. I ordered a beer and after asking for a lime on it it never came with one I could use.  Wife ordered a house margaritas and it was so sour that we had to send it back. Server never came to check on us for food and Carne burrito was over salted. Poor service. Colud not get the anyone to even bring us a check so we could quickly pay and get out of there as quickly  as pissible. Would not go back"}
{"text":"Alberto was our waiter. He is great!!!! We got there and wanted to sit outside and he totally accommodated us."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful experience here. I will be honest and admit that my first experience was not the best but I was extremely pleased with the response I got after my feedback was given. The coordinator reached out to me immediately to apologize and I decided to give it a second shot. I went there on a Friday night and was given some of the best service ever followed by some of the best food. We sat outside and enjoyed the lovely ambiance and enjoyed a tour of the menu. They have a unique selection of Mexican cuisine and have some of the best guacamole I've ever tasted. I also have to add that the margaritas were amazing! My favorite was the jalapeño cucumber marg.  I would certainly recommend this place and plan on returning. Thank you Cyndi! And thank you to the server as well!"}
{"text":"Server was friendly and helpful with ordering, though the rest of the visit service was only adequate. If you stick to the tacos, the food is good. Stay away from the shrimp al mojo de ajo. Overcooked, dry waste of money."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  So freakin' fresh, I have been dreaming about the guacamole for days! The fish taco was good size and very tasty.  I love the variety to be able to do ala carte if you want something small or want to do tapas.  There are larger entrees if you are looking for more formal.  The wait staff this visit was fantastic, but I have been there in the past and staff has been rude.  Especially the lady bartender...not so friendly!  For this reason I gave it a 4 star"}
{"text":"Margaritas, Horchata Martinis are fantastic.  We ordered the carne asada and beer battered shrimp burritos they were awful!"}
{"text":"I did a lot of review readings before I stopped in here for lunch... I thought the food was OK... Service was not too great. Very unattentive. A lot of banter between the staff and very little time spent with guests. I've come to learn that it's better to have ok food and GREAT service vs good food and crappy service. Good luck to this place. I won't be back any time soon."}
{"text":"Bland.  That's how I will remember Sol in Scottsdale.  After an hour wait, we expected this place to be great.  I would have even settled for good. But poor is how I rate this place. We had the Carne Asada tacos and the Carnitas tacos. The carne asada tacos had a little more flavor than the carnitas, but both lacked flavor.  The black beans were terrible. I gave the restaurant two stars because the salsa was good and the meat was very tender.  We used the salsa to give flavor to the tacos and beans."}
{"text":"We went to dinner at Sol last night for a friends 40th birthday. We had read reviews so we ordered the peel and eat shrimp and guacamole. The shrimp were great but super hot when delivered so hard to peel. The guacamole was adequate. I ordered the carnitas street tacos, the birthday guy ordered crane asada street tacos and the two others ordered fish tacos. All were good but we agreed the carnitas were the best of the three. Overall I would give the food for stars. The atmosphere is probably a four as well. It is super loud but most Mexican restaurants are. The three star overall rating is because of the service. We were rushed thru our meal like we were at the taco bueno drive thru. Our server told us it would be 15 minutes for our margaritas. They came in 5 but my husbands beer took 15 minutes to arrive. The appetizers arrived before our drinks and our entrees 5 minutes after the appetizers. We had barely made a dent in our entrees when they were asking if they could clear our plates. I think we were out of there in 45 minutes & that is only because our server finally got all of our \"hints\" about it being someone's birthday and brought out a dessert. Without that we would have been shooed out in about 30. Not the experience we were hoping for on our friends birthday so I may be being overly harsh. The food is good just don't expect a nice leisurely dining experience."}
{"text":"Great food, you can't go wrong and bartenders that know what they are doing which is an added bonus. Only downfall is that it's pretty pricy. Lunch for 2 was over $70"}
{"text":"If you are looking for the typical Phoenix-Mexican blanket of gloppy cheese and lard-heavy refried beans, this is not your restaurant.   If, however, you are looking for finesse and carefully crafted Mexican flavors, then rush over to Sol Mexican Cocina.  We had lunch there on a Tuesday afternoon.   We had a friendly server and excellent food.   Highlights were a bean paste dip, a very spicy salsa, and great chips.   We also tried a fish taco, a mushroom taco, and a beer batter shrimp taco.    All were terrific.    We were less thrilled with the naked guacamole and the rice that we had as sides   But Sol had brought out a plate of condiments at the start of the meal so we were able to \"season up\" so we enjoyed them.    I always had trouble finding Mexican restaurants when I have out of town guests.   Now I have Sol!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. Our waiters were so nice and helpful with the menu. I will definitely come back next time I'm in AZ!"}
{"text":"Just finished my meal at this restaurant. The appetizer and main meal were superb. I had 2 ala carte tacos, a filet and shrimp taco and a fresh fish taco. Excellent! Our waiter, Arnoldo, was very knowledgeable,  helping explain the menu and made perfect suggestions.  Any time I am near Scottsdale, I will eat here!"}
{"text":"The good: a cucumber jalapeno margarita - I would return for another.   The bad: I was not impressed with the carnitas street tacos. They came with no salsa and were bland. I asked for some salsa verde and was given two small containers (each about the size of a medicine cup from the Nyquil bottle) of good salsa (for which they charged me several dollars)... The accompanying rice was overcooked and the beans were tasteless and bland.   Diners accompanying me raved about their sweet potato tacos. I might return and try those --as well as another cucumber jalapeno margarita.  If in the mood for street tacos and salsa at a fair price, I will probably head to Chipotle--right across the street."}
{"text":"HOLY WOW!!!  What an experience!! Such amazing food, drink, and amongst all.. SERVICE Our server... Something with an H... Had a Mohawk... WAS UN-FLIPPIN-REAL He recommended the Kobe; it was perfect. If I ever make it back to Scottsdale I will be here in a heartbeat!!!  GO!!!!"}
{"text":"You can find me here at least once a weekend and usually on a Friday night after work with my hubby and some friends wanting to wind down with an amazing margarita. You'd think Arizona would have the margarita down but sadly most places don't but Sol really knows how to make a  fresh margarita on the rocks with fresh fruit and a great basil strawberry martini. I first came here on date night and loved it and we keep coming back for more. The food is really filling so we usually do two a la carte tacos a piece and its perfect plus when you arrive they give you fresh salsa and homemade tosada's.  I get the same thing every time because nothing tops it and there isn't a place in town that can beat these two tacos and yes i've been to the taco festival a few times, the tacos you have to get are the filet and shrimp el jefe and the fish taco gobernador. My husband likes the buffalada and the vampiro, which he actually never strays from and he grew up here so taco wise he is hard to please. Besides the food the environment is very pretty and has nice distilled lighting and what girl doesn't appreciate that. I would get a table outside or a 4 top at the bar and make a reservation as there is always a wait. They're on open table like most so it's super easy."}
{"text":"First of all, I am totally not understanding these 3 star reviews. Sol is awesome!!! The salsa and bean dip are complimentary and awesome with their chips. The pineapple goat cheese guac is amazing!!! I ordered the pork carnitas burrito with black beans and rice. I ate 6 hours ago and I'm still stuffed!!! My friend got chicken and shrimp quesadillas. She loved them as well. Everything is fresh, cooked well and garnished beautifully. This place finally quenched my TexMex craving in Scottsdale!! A++++++"}
{"text":"The service is great and the food is excellent. Have been back twice and it never disappoints. I look forward to returning."}
{"text":"Diner beware.  Food presentation is very nice but quality and taste are mediocre.  More troublesome are aspects of the experience that raise concerns about business practices.  A scallops dish (note plural) actually consisted of only one scallop diced into three slices.  Before dinner, we had drinks at the bar.  Our order was made four minutes before the end of happy hour but was entered into the register once happy hour ended (so we were charged regular pricing).  Practices like these may be subtle but struck us an exploitative business orientation that is alienating and a restaurant unworthy of support."}
{"text":"I knew SOL was not going to be the my favorite style of Mexican food, but what I didn't know was that their style involved no flavor!  I had read good things about this place so I decided to try it for my birthday dinner last night.  The Watermelon Margarita was quite refreshing, but after that, things just went downhill.  The \"chips\" that they bring you are whole corn tortillas that have been flash fried and dusted with chili powder. Whatever kind of tortillas they use, makes for some very thick, hard chips, and not very good at all.  The salsa is just hot, no real flavor and the complimentary bean dip is so bland and unappealing.  I guess the \"flavor enhancer\" tray including hot sauce, lime and salt that they bring to your table should have been the first clue that we were in for an under-seasoned meal.  We ordered the Bacon and Shrimp Guacamole to start, and it was bland, even though it had bacon in it!  Plus you had to eat it with more of those hard tortillas, no bueno.  I got the Grilled Burrito with carnitas and my dad ordered the carnitas platter.  When they set it in front of him, it just looked like a pile of mush...and it didn't taste much better.  He asked our waitress what he was supposed to do with it, if there was a sauce for it, but she said you are just supposed to eat it with the sides.  The pork was the most bland pork I have ever eaten in my life, even when it was mixed in the burrito with guacamole, cheese and beans.  I have no idea how they were able to extract such little flavor out of it, or why, according to our waitress, it is the most popular dish on the menu.  But then again, some mysteries are never solved...like falling in to the Bermuda Triangle.  My mom and my sister had a shrimp salad and shrimp tacos respectively, both of them said they were edible, but not exciting.  I did get some dessert nachos on the house for my birthday; chocolate and regular tortillas deep fried and dusted with cinnamon/sugar and a drizzle of Dulce de leche.  They were actually pretty good...but not good enough for me to come back.  Their seemed to be a decent crowd for a Monday night during the summer....but I am just not sure how long SOL can survive in this Valley of the Sun with so many other, better options for a Mexican Fiesta!"}
{"text":"This was our second time at SOL and probably our last. The rudest hostess I have ever encountered. I will spare the details, but she was the most annoyed employee of any restaurant I have seen in a while. She seemed truly annoyed that we were there, which was strange because we came before the dinner rush and the restaurant was pretty empty. The food isn't good enough to put up with such rude people."}
{"text":"Love this place! Arnoldo is the best! Great service, quality food, fantastic environment!!!! Lots of healthy options too!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty decent, service was nice. Kitchen made a few mistakes on our order but the server caught it before us and it was fixed."}
{"text":"Great place, Albert was great, awesome server. I cannot stress how great is the food. Come check it out. Ask for Albert, he'll take good care of you."}
{"text":"The staff here is so friendly and on top of it! They are constantly doing a great job grabbing drinks, clearing the table and bringing chips! I love the fish tacos (they are so good ) one thing is I wish they didn't put beer in the beans or any alcohol, doesn't mix well and wish they had some regular Mexican beans. Love their margaritas so good and refreshing! Overall love coming here and will still keep coming (and wishing they would change the beans)"}
{"text":"I went here expecting a nice experience and left despising the place. Our party had reserved a big table in the back as part of a going away dinner for a fellow co-worker. Since I wanted to treat my co-worker who was leaving, I asked to speak to our waitress upon entering. She merely grunted okay but did not seem pleased to actually have to talk to me about this task. Perhaps she didn't want to work that day... Anyway we all sat down and took orders. I decided to split a plate with my friend who is participating in Ramadan. She absolutely had to abstain from alcohol, so we decided to split an appetizer of guacamole and fish tacos. The title read \"Ensenada\" fish tacos. And the description underneath made no mention of alcohol. In fact, the item above this was \"Beer-Battered\" fish tacos. So to be practical I thought those were the two different alcohol vs. non-alcohol options. Lo and behold, when we get the order the food runner says \"beer-battered\" tacos. I was surprised and said, \"What do you mean? We got Ensenada.\" He proceeds to say Ensenada is beer-battered. And I'm thinking why the hell are the \"beer-battered\" tacos described as such and how are patrons supposed to automatically know \"Ensenada\" is basically the exact same thing? The description should at least have said it was cooked in alcohol as well. Nowhere in the description did it say how it was cooked.  Our waitress, Beth, proceeded to act like we should have known better, stating, \"What's the problem here?\" as she noticed our convo with the runner. The two proceeded to explain the beer gets cooked out of it. Well, excuse us, but that's not the point. My friend is taking Ramadan seriously and was not about to break her vow just because the entree description didn't note the alcohol (but specified it on other items!). After the debate, they proceeded to serve us grilled tacos instead, which were mediocre at best. I was really disappointed considering the place is sold as a bit higher end, especially based on location/atmosphere.  To make the experience even better, our guacamole never showed up. And by that time we didn't care, considering our server would probably think it was just us, trying to be difficult. We agreed to make sure there was no charge for it, but when the check came out it was on the receipt. So we brought that up and it was taken off but the whole night felt like a giant screw up of an unworthy meal. And having the waitstaff act like we were being \"picky\" about the alcohol was uncalled for, especially considering the reason. Disappointing experience, unwelcoming service and inadequately described menu."}
{"text":"Came to check out this new addition at Scottsdale Quarter, and I'm glad I did. Love the decor, the live music on a Tuesday night, and of course, the food!   Menu was simple, choices of the usual Baja mexican food, with emphasis on their special a-la-carte tacos, which ranges from $5-$10 each, definitely on the pricy side for just one taco. I had the grilled fish tacos (specialty plate) which came with two tacos, mexican rice and black beans, like the standard, I'd say the tacos weren't spectacular like I was expected, but still decent. However, our order of the mixed seafood ceviche and the carne asada quesadilla were wonderful! The ceviche was very fresh and well-seasoned, probably the best of the night.  The quesadilla came with a creamy chipotle sauce which was a nice add-on. And the plate is really big, definitely a shareable entree.  Service was great! One little drawback was that we had to wait for a table for 20mins on a Tuesday night, around 6:40pm, under the bright sun that their blinds by the patio didn't really cover, yes, it was very hot... they need those patio misters.... this being said, make your reservation before heading there, especially on this hot summer!!"}
{"text":"Arnoldo was the bomb.com. Awesome service and gave my sis an awesome birthday experience!"}
{"text":"After moving to Phoenix from Newport Beach I was thrilled to find a taste of home here in AZ. The food at Sol is still wonderful, but never have a received such poor service. The restaurant was practically empty at lunch time on a Saturday, yet it took at least 15 minutes to get a drink order in. Once approached by a server, he apologized and blamed the hostess for not telling him we were here waiting....Same server had been standing 5 feet from us chatting with kitchen staff the entire time. While trying to get the attention of other waitstaff, they made clear eye contact only to walk away without saying a word.   I always remembered the other location for having superb service as well as a varied and interesting menu, but here in Scottsdale, we were ignored our entire meal and treated as an annoyance. Sol has always been a wonderful dining experience; Great food but even better service. While the food was tasty as always, what could have been an amazing dining experience was ruined by the rude and inattentive staff. I loved this restaurant before, and had always been a loyal patron to the Newport Beach location. But Scottsdale, you have fallen far short...Never will I waste my time here again."}
{"text":"I have been to Sol Cocina in both Scottsdale and Newport Beach many times.  In the past the food has been good but pricey as you pay for the \"scene\" and a neat décor.  This time I specifically checked to see what the hours were for their happy hour on their website and it says \"Happy Hour:Daily: 4pm--7pm\".  Our waiter Arnoldo acted like we were crazy when I asked about happy hour at 6:20pm.  We received very poor service and should have just left before dropping $117 for inattention and attitude.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"The food is bland and extremely over priced. The menu and website prominently feature fresh made tortillas. We were served cheap, low quality, premade tortillas. Everything we ordered was devoid of herbs, spices, and salt. Our server was kind, when he showed up, as he was inattentive."}
{"text":"Really impressed with the food! We asked the waitress to choose our dishes for us and she made excellent decisions!   The food was incredible, especially the pork, and it was plenty. Definitely worth the price."}
{"text":"We seriously loved Alberto! Seriously had the BEST service we have ever had! He was kind, on top of it and so quick to understand our needs. Definitely coming back to see him! Love you, Alberto!"}
{"text":"We had a nice time at SOL. Our table was ready right when we arrived. We sat a little longer than expected before the server came to ask about drinks, but not a big deal overall. The food was pretty good. I had the Chile Verde plate, it was a little different than what I am used to (good thing) and I enjoyed it. Kids menu was just right with the kid basics and the atmosphere was good for a family. I liked the cucumber jalapeno margarita, I would have had two, but it was getting late. We'll be back when in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"For our first time in the area, we were lucky to find Sol Mexican Cocina right away.  The food, ambience and service were great!"}
{"text":"Food and drinks were both very fresh and tasty.  Service was great, everyone was nice and friendly.  Cool restaurant, would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Our server was great.  The chicken mole was very tasty having a smokey flavor with a hint of cinnamon.  Their quinoa side dish was also amazing.  They are pretty busy so making reservations is recommended."}
{"text":"I'm going to give two stars because I do feel our waitress was doing her job.  The restaurant had 1 other person in it and the staff looked annoyed when we walked in. It was 8pm on Monday.    Our chip basket caught on fire, and not just a couple little flames it CAUGHT ON FIRE. I asked for help while my husband dumped his water glass out on the flames, it took three glasses of water to get the flames out. No one came over during the ordeal. After the fire was out the hostess came over with the biggest look of disgust I have ever seen, said nothing to either one of us, picked the sopping basket up off the table with burnt remnants that dripped all over the rest of our stuff and walked away. There were ambers all over me, my husband and my handbag and she said nothing and moved like a damn snail. She walked the basket back to the group of servers who had been standing back by the kitchen laughing and chuckling. A separate server then came over with a rag to try and help clean up the water mess, they all seemed annoyed that our table that only seconds ago had a small bonfire going now had water all over it... shouldn't we be the ones annoyed??  I'm wondering now if it was punishment for the fire incident, but our food came out warm at best, with the rice being room temp. I had the grilled chicken tacos with rice and beans and none if it was edible (our waitress did not charge for my meal). My husband had the carne asado burrito that was also room temp, he ate 90% of it but said it was nothing to go back for.   Sol! We are so disappointed! We spend a lot of time in Scottsdale and have always wondered about your restaurant with the loads of people we see there on Friday's and Saturdays. So what gives? Are things only good on the weekends or were we punished for the bonfire? I see other wonderful reviews..."}
{"text":"This is probably our favorite place to eat tacos. All of the tacos have so many fresh, delicious ingredients. Sol has the absolute best margaritas! We love coming here for amazing service and amazing food!!"}
{"text":"We were seated quickly. Food came out promptly after order. We had grilled corn, which is beautifully and artfully executed. Carne Asada taco plate has tender beef. The sides is to die for, I highly recommend the quinoa salad.  Everything is delicious. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great food and great atmosphere!!  Specialty tacos are fantastic ... no wrong decision here."}
{"text":"Love Sol!!! Delicious food and drinks. Their ceviche and guacamole is the best!!!! Rodrigo was so pleasant and helpful and made my experience with my friends a great time! Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Jared is the best server ever! We always had our chips, salsa and water topped off without even noticing. Thanks Jared. Oh yeah and the food was great!"}
{"text":"Delicious specialty tacos, especially the fish taco and the chicken taco.  Grilled burrito was excellent.  Shrimp chili relleno was good, not great.  Jalapeño cucumber margarita might be the best I have ever had.  Chips are large and round (about the size of a small salad plate) which we didn't love, salsa was very good.  We will be back!  PS don't order the Blackberry Ginger Margarita....awful!"}
{"text":"Not impressed to say the least. The best thing we had was the kids been and chess burrito. My wife's $12 steak and shrimp and steak taco had limited flavor. My chicken mole was cold in the middle and had lackluster flavors for mole.  An overpriced meal that would have been sent back if it was not for wanting to make sure our child had his food quickly."}
{"text":"The food, the environment, and the drinks are all amazing. The corn and the guacamole are my biggest recommendations, but I wasn't disappointed with one thing I ordered. Hosting a large event is hard to get perfect, but SOL got pretty close. Shelly was helpful and incredibly flexible when it came to making the reservations and setting up the menu. Elliot and Rikki were our servers and were beyond patient and provided amazing service to 50+ of us. I'll definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"We moved to Phoenix a couple months ago, and we have had nothing but fantastic food until today. We wandered in during happy hour on 5/6 and found two seats at the bar. The service was great, and the drinks were excellent. The chips were also outstanding, hot and fresh. That's about all I can recommend. The pork tacos were blah, and way too hot, and I like spicy food. The chicken tacos were not good at all - the chicken was bland and came across as cheap rubbery factory meat. The guacamole could have been good, but it had about 3x the onions necessary. I also tried the tortilla soup - mistake. Was so over salted it was inedible. Go for the drinks during HH and that's about it IMO."}
{"text":"Wally is the best! He makes great margaritas and mixed drinks!  The best bartender in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Let's skip right past the fantastic food and wonderful hot and raw ceviches. The service is like walking into a room full of puppies. Alberto is like the keeper of these puppies bringing joy and satisfaction right to our table like a maven of deliciousness. Go ahead come to Sol ask for Alberto and change your life!"}
{"text":"We've been to this restaurant numerous times and never had a bad meal. The food is excellent as are the drinks and service. The live music is good, although a bit loud at times. The patio is cool enough with the monsters, so dinner outside in the summer is bearable."}
{"text":"Don't love this place and I want to. It's got a great location and concept, but the food is average at best and overpriced. Last time I was there the server left herself a $70 tip instead of the $7 I put on the ticket. I called and they were very quick to fix it, so I will give them points for good customer service."}
{"text":"The drinks and the onion rings were the best things we ordered, unfortunately the tacos did not impress.  The service was barely above efficient.  Will not return."}
{"text":"So we came here on a recommendation from our resort.  We celebrated our sons 14 birthday.  I made a reservation on open table a few days prior.  On the day of the reservation they did call to confirm, which was very nice.  I let the hostess know it was for a birthday and she made note of it to have a free dessert. We got free guacamole for staying at the neighboring resort.  Thank goodness it was free because it was nothing special and not very tasty. We ordered the corn appetizer which was good.   Everyone ordered different types of tacos which were over priced for what they were.  The vampire tacos were supposed to be spicy but weren't, so that was disappointing.   The beans and rice sides are very subpar.  I ordered the ribeye taco & queso vampiro taco. These were tasty, not sure they were worth 19.50 for the 2 tacos, no sides.  The grande clase azul margarita was a really good margarita.   So to sum it up: Service- 5star Food- 2.5star Cost- 2star All in all not sure I would return for the food but maybe for the drink."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Waited an hour to have several groups sat down before we sat down. We had reservations too. Would not comeback. Food was not good, service was even worst."}
{"text":"Great ambiance service food drinks and all the way around an amazing place. Must go. We had peel and eat shrimp. Tacos were great and my non burrito bit ate his in about 5 minutes."}
{"text":"The 6 of us walked in at 4:00pm New Years Eve and although they were booked for the night, they found a special table for us.  I had the Steak, very flavorful and well seasoned. We had an excellent server who took good care of us.  My Bride really appreciated the Shrimp Poblano but wished the Shrimp was bigger."}
{"text":"My favorite mexican place.  Best chips and salsa.  Tacos are simply amazing.  Simply too much good to describe.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is a matter of taste.  I see that a lot of people really like it but i prefer more traditional mexican food.  It would be nice to find an upscale place that actually served normal food.  Seems only dive places have regular mexican food.  So, this place has 'upscale' mex food.  Even given that i wasn't that impressed.  We sat near the kitchen area and that sort of made me feel uncomfortable watching them back there.  I'm not sure i want to see people making my food...Then i noticed that a lot of food sat for a long time waiting to be served.  The food itself just wasn't what I prefer.  Odd combinations and ingredients.  If you like traditional chips and salsa, forget it here.  They give you something similar in the form of fried round tortilla and some watery sauce stuff...  If you are the Newport Beach look at me crowd, you will probably like this place."}
{"text":"From the salsa, to the fresh tortilla chips....and the service....all exceptional. Business lunch, ordered the Carne Asada Street Tacos....3 of them with side options, which for me were rice and beans. A step above typical Mexican cuisine.....I will return soon to try other menu choices."}
{"text":"So, today we were killing time waiting for a pedi across the street.  We sat at the bar, mid afternoon and moderately busy.  Veronica, the bartender welcomed us as if we were the only guests in the place.  Two of us ordered an \"off menu\" specialty margarita, I asked for a tequila recommendation.  She nailed the margarita and was very well versed in all the tequila varietals!!  Please visit SOL and belly up to the bar and ask for Veronica!!"}
{"text":"The food was incredible. Great ambiance and Live music on taco Tuesday. The service was excellent, Arnoldo was very attentive and friendly. Definitely try the melted goat cheese starter. We will be back!"}
{"text":"When Friday or Saturday rolls around, and my wife and I want to go out to dinner, we almost always choose Sol Mexican Cocina!  This is where we go when we want to be pampered with great service, great food, and of course the great tasting Cadillac margarita!!  All of the servers are great! Very knowledgeable, friendly and make our dining experience one for the books!  There is however one server who knows us well, her name is Amy, we always hope we are seated in her section, she is a breath of fresh air!!! Awesome!   The food is just incredible, from the coconut calamari, to the great tasting street taco's to my favorite, the short rib tacos!  Out of this world!  This Restaurant is our stand by, go to Restaurant!  I sincerely hope that when you are in the Scottsdale area, you will give this place a try, you will NOT be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Typical chain mexican......the salsa wasn't bad.  I had a fish taco and tortilla soup.  The fish taco tortilla was americanized as was the filling.  The tortilla soup definitely was pre-prepared."}
{"text":"Great food! So fresh, flavorful, and cooked to perfection! And service was excellent too. Armando was our server, but his brothers Rodrigo and Israel came by frequently to check up on us and made sure we had everything we needed. Fabulous tagteaming (even if we did confuse them for each other)."}
{"text":"Consistent food and consistent service. We always get treated like it's lunch at a 5 star resort, even when we bring the baby.  We love both ceviches, vampiro tacos, and I personally love the mango con chile margarita. And I honestly think they have the best Spanish rice in the valley. The tropical ceviche comes with sweet potato and beet chips that were amazing. I could have just eaten that they were so good!  Beautiful location and a great place to stop for lunch when you are walking around the Quarter."}
{"text":"It's a beautiful restaurant. The decor is grade A, classy and dim and sexy. I only went here for lunch, but I'd imagine it's a great date place, especially if your date is shallow like me and gets excited about visually impressive places. You enter and behind the host's table is a whole wall lined with tequila bottles. Really gorgeous.  I can't remember what my husband ordered. I remember we got the mexican corn as an appetizer, and I got a lovely cocktail that had raspberries and champagne in it. Quite delicious. The corn was so so. Better mexican corn can be found at the Black Chile Grill in the Biltmore. It wasn't charred enough, and I think the amazing creaminess from slathered mayo wasn't there. Probably was healthier for you though! My fish tacos were good, but not outstanding.   In short, a good restaurant, but nothing memorable. Don't go out of your way to enjoy the food there, but don't avoid it either. If you're there shopping, make sure to give it a shot!"}
{"text":"A bit pricey, but the ceviche and halibut tacos were great. Nice ambiance too."}
{"text":"I recently went to SOL for happy hour. The items on the menu sound excellent, but none of them were very good. I tried both shrimp items on the happy hour menu. The shrimp cocktail and the pan seared shrimp. They give you nothing to peel the pan seared shrimp with and they are burning hot when you get them. However, the flavor was good. As for the shrimp cocktail the taste is very bitter and it was watery.   The salsa and guacamole were nice, but I wouldn't go back unless it was just for drinks and chips."}
{"text":"Immediately upon walking in you could sense the inexperience and the disorganization of the staff.  That will probably improve.  We were finally seated at a comfortable table in a rather large, warm, modern,  yet somehow rustic space.  Chips and salsa were free, which is always fun.  However, there were like three oversized chips in a tiny basket, so the poor bussers had to run around like maniacs trying to refill them. The waiter was hysterical, immediately flattering us by telling us what a great looking couple we are. I am ugly, so I assume he was talking about my girlfriend.  Once again,  I paid ten dollars for approximately two ounces of low end house wine.  This seems to be a new trend in the hip restaurants, so I feel  privileged to be amongst the first few to be ripped off.  The food was very good and our dishes were more than a little spicy.  But the portions were modest, at best.  I did think that the interior space was really well done.  They also had a rather large, comfortable-looking outdoor seating area.  There seemed to be care taken in the preparation of the food, and the menu and ambiance seemed to be well thought out, if not calculated.  However, at the end of the day I came away thinking it was just Mexican food.  And all in all I believe it was quite overpriced for the experience."}
{"text":"I'm not a real fan of Mexican food, but I gotta say it was fabulous. The staff was fun and helpful. The service was outstanding. Ask for Aronld he was great."}
{"text":"Sol Mexican Cocina just opened this week, so I'll take that into Consideration. Beautiful place, but give this place time to get there Act together. Checked in with the Hostess and was told 55 Minute Wait. Ok, found 2 Seats at the Bar and that was a very Positive Experience. Stacey our Bartender. was Terrific, she did everything perfect & the Drinks were Great. We ordered Guacamole and it was the Best I Have ever had in a Restaurant. Was followed by a Carne Burritto which came Cold & Was Comped.After sitting at the Bar for over an Hour we were never Told a Table was ready. The Hostesses are very Weak and need Much More training. My Suggestion is hire Older More Skilled, Expereinced Girls. who Know how to Manage the Crowd.The Place was Extremely Busy and Should do well and will Definitely give it another Try."}
{"text":"Albert was an amazing server! The margaritas are delicious and not overpoweringly sweet. Great atmosphere for a date or a casual get together. Don't miss this spot. And ask for Albert!"}
{"text":"Visited while on business......the food was good, ambiance nice, service could have been a little better but the great tasting Margaritas made up for the lack of attentiveness in service.  Our server was great but while waiting for our table, we waited a long time at the bar for anyone to notice us....."}
{"text":"No big deal. Stale chips. Good skinny margaritas.  Carne asada mushy. Overpriced for Mexican food that tries to be different."}
{"text":"Delicious!   Great food and booze.  Great service. Good music.  The food is fresh, not precooked.  The booze is top shelf, with the best sour mix, made by them, not the garbage sour mix everywhere else.  My hubby was very happy!"}
{"text":"A group of us ate here last night, and sad to say no one enjoyed any of the food. As a group we ordered the   -'Spicy' red onion rings, which were not spicy at all, and instead overpriced, over crispy, over sized onion rings. .. -Panuchos, which as the menu describes it  are verde masa stuffed with mexican cheeses, plantain, cilantro & caramelized onions, on borracho black beans with crema, lettuce, pico de gallo: In reality, a crunch corn tortilla folded like an empanada with sppon fulls of black beans topped with lettuce. We didn't taste any plantains, cilantros or caramelized onions   - Grilled chicken burrito, which literally had 5 tiny pieces of grilled chicken meat and ladles and ladles of black beans.  - Grilled veggie burrito, with what seemed like their entire pot of black beans in one burrito. There was no sign of the pico, guac and onion that were supposed to be in.   If you want to leave the restaurant bloated and feeling gross since at every bite you've literally ate a spoon full of black beans then this is the place for you. Totally felt like a waste of money and all that I paid for was a plate full of black beans.   Unfortunate since the ambience of this place is nice, and the menu items actually sound delicious...but don't be fooled."}
{"text":"I drive all the way from chandler every time just to come here!! And it's definitely worth it every time.  Where to start, the Sol ceviche is amazing! The fish  is always fresh and tasty. It's my favorite ceviche in the valley. The tostada chips with the spices are amazing! Margaritas and drinks are crafted very well and delicious. It's the little touches that make it amazing, like the habanero sauce with salt and lime on the side. Salsa and bean dip they bring you is so fresh and delicious. The taco selection is big and from most I've tried they are good!  I recommend this place to anyone who loves fresh unique Mexican food."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of their Newport location. Went with the girls for drinks. The margaritas were fresh and flavorful! Great people watching. I will return to try what looked like yummy food."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Guacamole is excellent, I've tried the naked and the Guacamole SOL - the SOL is interesting but I'll stick with the traditional.  Panuchos are very good.  The meat in the taco Vampiro was out of this world and they melt cheese between the two outer layers of tortilla with very spicy fresh peppers which adds even more flavor and some nice heat.  Sweet potato and black bean tacos were great too.  Short Rib Barbacoa is incredible!!  Their rice and beans on the side are also very good.  White corn poblano soup is delicious with a little heat.  Good salsa and they gave us a hot sauce that was pretty serious.  All three trips were take out so I can't comment on the service.  Parking is terrible but that goes without saying.  Prices are cheap for what you get."}
{"text":"I just ate there last week and it was amazing! We had the shrimp cucarachas and the Spanish octopus. If you love seafood like me, these are fantastic!"}
{"text":"Another gourmet taco/Mexican restaurant, are we saturated yet?   I guess not because I keep going to them all.  Had the calamari coconut appetizer, a little bland.  Guacamole was good, can order multiple types ranging from your standard guacamole to guacamole with fruit and nuts added.  2 tacos, chicken with ghost pepper sauce was good but HOT, and vampirio which was carne asada on a double decker shell.  Chips at the table are full tortillas you break up yourself, pretty good chips and salsa.  Also a cup of beans with the chips and salsa.  A lot of other menu items to pick from.  Go and enjoy."}
{"text":"Ate here with my wife yesterday and overall had a great experience. I had never been in before and I was uncertain of what I wanted to eat. My server ____ I forget her name...but however explained to me how the menu worked and offered some menu items to me that she thought I would enjoy. She was right I ordered a total of four tacos and they were all amazing! The Yellowfin wasn't my favorite, but I am also not a huge fish fan as is. Again it was an overall great experience, and I am defiantly a return customer!"}
{"text":"The service was top notch and the food was some of the best Mexican food I've had. We live in an area with many \"baja\" type restaurants, but none are as good as SOL. I had the Vampiro taco and another at our table had the enchiladas. Both were great!"}
{"text":"Want great Baja Mexican while in Scottsdale check out Sol. We had great fish tacos and angus beef tacos. All fresh ingredients and wait staff was fun and provider great service. Busy place so make reservations if eating after 5:30 pm but note no reservations taken less than 3 hours before by phone and online reservations must be made at least 24 hours in advance."}
{"text":"This was my hubby and my first time here and we were so impressed!!! Loved the ambience! Such a cool and fun place. The food was amazing! We started with the traditional guac, which was so good! I had the blackberry/ ginger marg, it was delicious. We had the carne Asada tacos. So yummy! Our server was very good made our time there enjoyable. I can't wait to go back, especially when it cools down, so we can hangout on the patio."}
{"text":"First time here and we will be back! Great food, fun atmosphere and amazing service - ask for Alberto!!"}
{"text":"Tried it twice. First time they gave us okay drinks and we asked for seconds and they brought us different drinks. Odd.   Second visit they gave us our Grande Marg in a pint glass..."}
{"text":"Great service and great food. Forgot to take pictures sorry! The guacamole had great taste and a spicy kick. Shared the pollo and carne asada taco plates. The pollo was alright but the carne was Bueno. I would order it again. The pork burrito was good, ton of volume. The original margarita had good flavor, fills two full glasses!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food (and margaritas!) - great atmosphere - and very cool setting. I'd highly recommend trying an assortment of the street tacos. They are a house specialty and delicious! The pineapple habanero margarita was the perfect companion. I wouldn't come if you are looking for a place to have an intimate conversation as it is crowded and quite loud - but that's what makes it fun!"}
{"text":"Having visited SOL Newport over the past couple of years, we were anxious for this one to open.  I want to say this about these 2 restaurants. They are not typical Mexican restaurants that so many people try to categorize them into.  They are a very regional Baja Peninsula/Coastal Mexican restaurant.  They don't serve Fajitas or Chimichanga's. What they do offer is some of the most original menu items from that particular region, including their Goat Cheese and Sweet Corn appetizers, their Strawberry and Serrano Chili Guacamole or their Sol Guacamole are also items you won't see anywhere I've been. All of their Ceviche's are excellent and I give special consideration to their Hot and Raw Ceviche... Incredible. Yes they have Street Taco's and their Vampiro taco's seem to be the big hit, and I would definately agree. Don't be afraid to ask them to change something if  you don't like a certain element, they seem not to mind in the slightest.   The Decor may be typical \"North Scottsdale\" but it's at home in any \"typical Upscale\" city or area and they've tried to keep it open, and not too formal and again, original.  Just enjoy the place.  I've gotten to know Robbi, Stacy, and Nicole well enough and better bartenders you will hardly find than these 3. They know the menu and their drinks, and are confident in what they do."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere.  Food just ok.  Guacamole was super spicy to the point where no one at our table would finish it.  Reasonable portion sizes where you don't have to worry about taking home leftovers.  I ate the carnitas street tacos which were good but the corn tortillas fell apart and were a bit messy.  Special margarita for St. Patricks day looked very festive but was kind of bland.  Arrived at 5pm, hostess said patio was booked full even though it was empty.  When I left an hour and a half later, patio was still 3/4 empty."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this restaurant and the experience was awful! It started when we first walked in the door. The hostess was absolutely horrible. She looked us up and down, did not greet us and simply asked \"how many?\" When I gave her the number in my party, she rolled her eyes, and said \"you can sit here.\" It table right by the door, when we asked politely if we could get another table in the middle of the room because it was too hot by the door she got upset, rolled her eyes again, and said \"if you want that table, I'll have to set it up and this one is already set.\" When we told her no, she gave us attitude and said \"I'll have to set it up.\" When she finished, she went behind the desk up front, didn't look at us, and said, \"your table is over there.\" And pointed to the middle of the room. When I asked if she could show us to Table she sighed and rolled her eyes, took us to the table, and threw the menus on the table. That was only the beginning, the waiter who took our drink order seemed just as annoyed, and threw the chips on the table, and got irritated when we tried to ask for drink suggestions. The service was terrible, it was hot and only the fans were going, we ended up not eating here because we did not feel welcomed. This place was horrible, I do not recommend unless you want to pay high prices to be treated like an inconvenience. If I could give this negative stars, I would."}
{"text":"great atmosphere and decor, but the food was just blah.  didn't love it. the wait for 4 of us to get served..  took forever.  lots of better mexican food places in town."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service was good. Food and drinks were extremely overpriced for their quality. Came for Cinco de Mayo and was extremely disappointed with their $10 \"special\" for their margarita. $15 burrito was filled with more onions than chicken and got \"enchilada style\" which was an additional $2 for a tiny SPRINKLE of shredded cheese. If the prices were reasonable I would return again."}
{"text":"Great happy hour place , we go every month ! It gets kind of crowded so make reservations"}
{"text":"A group of us dined here last night and we really enjoyed ourselves. We have to praise our wonderful server Amanda. She was awesome - friendly, funny, really knew the menu. We started with coconut calamari, which was fantastic. Then we took Amanda's recommendation and tried the Hot & Raw Tropical Ceviche, which was excellent. Two of us had the Short Ribs Barbacoa - super flavorful.   Ambiance was energetic, and I highly recommend visiting SOL Mexican Cocina."}
{"text":"We got married yesterday.. and had brunch with our kids here. The food was Delicious & Service was great! Will be back for certain! Thank you!! Sherri"}
{"text":"First things first! If you have champagne taste and a beer budget this isn't for you.  If you complain about pricing in Scottsdale you can always Go to filibertos where your beef came from a coyote or victims of cartel violence. Anyhow this place is awesome From service to food.  Holden, Gio and Mike are the best servers they have there.  They make the experience ten times better.  Very knowledgable about the menu and drinks.  Their appetizers are unique creations.  I've tried several different tacos on the menu and loved the garlic rib eye taco the most.   You must must must try their Kobe Skirt Steak.  (For those that complain about price do research on KOBE beef. It didn't come from the LA Lakers) They have the best skirt steak in town.   Will def be a regular for years to come.   Thank you guys"}
{"text":"Our waiter Arnoldo was wonderful. Food was great. I wish that they offered a taco sampler."}
{"text":"The food was excellent!!  Our server was Arnoldo and he was at the top of his game.  He explained the menu and gave us some good tips.  Will definately be back again, hopefully with the same date."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Great staff but a very outstanding service from Albert, he goes the extra mile for the customers.  Thank you so much and people if you're reading this review try the carnitas street tacos YUMM!"}
{"text":"SOL is located in Scottsdale Square, pretty convenient location and you can sit outside and watch the street - so OK but not a nice view. The place is a larger, more upscale Mexican restaurant. The drinks I thought were overpriced, but the rest of the menu is not too bad considering the location.  The atmosphere is decent, fitting to the decor and food. It is loud in here, especially when there is a young kid next to us! Otherwise though, pretty normal for this kind of restaurant.  We had the chips bean dip and salsa, then on to our entrees which were Carne Asada tacos and Grilled fish tacos. The portion sizes were average and the food quality good, but nothing great.   Overall, this is the kind of experience you expect in a chain kind of Mexican restaurant. Nothing to really make it stand out."}
{"text":"Double date with the wife and some friends. Service was average. The beers were over priced for Dos Lager Bottles. We tried 1 of the guac dips and it was pretty good as well as the salsa. I had 1 of the tacos option and they were pretty good. I spent about $70 for the both of us. So be prepaired to dish out the $$$$"}
{"text":"The food and service was equally spectacular. The fresh tastes that stimulate your taste buds to the point of ecstasy. Ambiance is perfect for the authentic food. Don't hesitate to make the drive to Scottsdale. Sol is now a mainstay in my top ten restaurants in the valley."}
{"text":"Outstanding food, service and ambience! Had lunch with the family and we agreed, this is on our short list now!"}
{"text":"It was good even though I ordered the wrong thing. The burrito had a nice flavor but I didn't like how my black beans were cold while the chicken was hot. This made every bite awkward. The price is reasonable. I'll be going back to try something else. My wife loved her carnitas burrito. We both enjoyed the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Was excited to try this restaurant on our last night in Scottsdale after seeing the amazing reviews. To be honest, it's really hard to mess up Mexican food for me, but this place managed to do it in the most mediocre way possible.  To start, we were greeted by the most apathetic hostess I've ever come across. She pretty much twirled her hair with a confused look as to why anyone was standing in front of her, as if it wasn't her job to greet customers. The experience picked up when we were seated right away on the outdoor patio and immediately greeted with delicious chips and salsa (yum!)...pretty much all downhill from there.   Food: Ordered the chicken street tacos plate. Seemed pretty straight forward, but there was ZERO flavor in the dish. Even after adding some of the delicious aforementioned salsa, the tacos were extremely bland. The rice was basically cold and honestly tasted like something out of a box.  Service: Our waitress acted extremely exasperated the entire time - constantly referring to how busy she was and how many people there were. She ran by us a few times when we first sat to tell us she'd be right back, but it was a good while before she came to take our drink order. To be honest, we didn't see much of her the whole time. When our food was ready, a runner brought it to us and pretty much threw it on the table before running back to the kitchen. When we were ready for our check, we sat there for a good 10 minutes before seeing our server again.  While the atmosphere of SOL was very cool - nice decor and seems like a trendy spot - the service and food left much to be desired. If I were a local, I am not sure that I'd be back to try again. Just not worth the hype."}
{"text":"Great food. They do traditional with a slight twist that adds a ton of flavor. I'd highly recommend the SOL Guacamole which adds ingredients you wouldn't normally expect, like mango and tequila. The flavor is amazing. Service was great, food was well prepared. Definitely a place I'll return to."}
{"text":"Brought my parents here for their 37th Wedding Anniversary and it was such a great experience! The food and service is truly impeccable and probably one of the best Mexican restaurants I have been to a long time. We ordered several of their Taco's a la carte and all were fantastic. Amazing spicy Serrano margaritas to accompany the food. I can't wait to visit my parents and go back to place!"}
{"text":"This is some real quality high end Mexican food.  Very interesting menu and great tequila selection.  Deep flavors and great service!   Can't wait to return to try different items.  Not difficult to see why the place is so busy and rated so high on Yelp."}
{"text":"Beautiful setting.  Located on the outside edge of the Kierland Mall.  Great patio and great food.  Parking right next to the restaurant in the parking garage."}
{"text":"One of my go-to places!  Drinks are yummy, food is fantastic, atmosphere is great, and staff is great. I always order the sweet potato and black bean tacos, and they will rock your world, and you'll even do a little dance in your chair.    Overall, the restaurant is very welcoming, and will keep you coming back for more!"}
{"text":"This place is super good! No complaints! Food is great, atmosphere is great , drinks are reasonably priced. I wish they sold their tocos individually cheaper but that's ok because the other food is great."}
{"text":"Sol. Or should I say \"SOUL Cousina\". Taco Tuesday's. I would take a picture of my food but there is nothing left to show you. Oh \"Don't lick your plate you will get in trouble\" the staff doesn't care but my wife got really embarrassed.  Lol. Cheers"}
{"text":"Stopped here while shopping; unexpected. Grabbed street tacos and quesadillas. The service was so so; I clarify that by it being a little slow (maybe I was in a hurry), but my waiter when he was there was attentive and super helpful. Think I was grouchy from shopping; who knows.   My recommendation. If you order the corn, let them cut it and set on the dish. They only put seasoning on 1/4 - 1/2 of the corn. So you are losing flavor. Back home in Michigan there are a couple places that do a similar corn dish, but they have seasoning on the entire thing, which was what I expected.    Other than that, it was a nice place. I have a favorite place back home that is hard to beat, hence the 4 stars. But this place is still good and recommend you stop in."}
{"text":"Excellent service coupled with excellent food quality, taste and portion. Newer style Mexican menu with some classic tastes as well. Pros good food, great service. Cons tight dining room, limited parking in the garage but the valet service was top notch and very helpful, fee for valet plus tip, FYI."}
{"text":"Food was good, but very pricey.  It's a fancy take on Mexican food.  If you want an upscale Scottsdale Mexican restaurant, this is the place for you.  If you want authentic Mexican food, there are better options in town.    I would go back for drinks at the bar."}
{"text":"Are 1st time here.. Armando are server..one of the finest best fucken tasting,mouthwatering carnitas tacos in Phx..  We went there during happy.I was going to order there $20 margaritas.. But are server told me .. Hey.  We have happy hr.. Let me get u a drink that I think u will love..  So I'm like cool.. He strongly recommend that we try there happy hr carnita tacos!! Thank God I did.. Both my wife and I went crazy.. The drink were all $6 margaritas!!!!!  Beauitful atmosphere!! Both my wife and I walked out of there completely full!!!! One of the best restaurants in the state!!  Try it!!!!"}
{"text":"Beautiful place & the specialty frozen mango margarita was AWESOME!!! The starter grilled corn  with cheese, chili & lime and the rice were very good.  The beef filet & shrimp taco had a strange aftertaste - sort of a burnt - chemical type flavor that I think came from the grill.  The staff were wonderful"}
{"text":"Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu, he gave great recommendations and had extensive knowledge about the tequilas. Not only was he smart, he was kind and hilarious! I had the shrimp taquitos, quesadilla, rice and beans! So yummy. I paired it with a house margarita and my friend had the frozen strawberry margarita. I was extremely jealous of her drink as it had real strawberries inside of it and tasted delicious, I will be having that next time. Menu is great, their chips and salsa is AMAZING! The salsa had the perfect amount of heat and spice, I love spicy! Can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"We had reservations for Valentines. We ordered cocktails ,guacamole and shrimp to start. It took over 30 minutes for it to be served. I ordered corn tortillas with the guacamole. They were ice cold. Food ,and service was very mediocre. Such a disappointment."}
{"text":"Great high end Californified Mexican!  The interior is hip a requirement for the area and filled with all the Scott's typically lunch clientele ... you know know who you're ;). If it weren't 108 out, dining out side would rock here.  Food was great!  Server brought us home dad chips which are whole 4\" tortillas which as seamsosned with a smoke and salty something.  They are accompanied by a trio of relishes - salsa and modifiers.  There is a black bean salsa, a mild fire roasted salsa, and a modifier plate so you can season them to taste... habaneros sauce, salt and limes.  Great flavors!  The carne asada plate of tacos was FANTASTIC!!!!!  Smokey, seasoned, JUICY, full... sooo good!  Server was friendly and attentive.  Server recommended tacos ala carte, but at $11-$15 EACH, my principles wouldn't let me do it... the thought of a taco for $13 made my taint pucker like watching Fail videos on Youtube.  Funny, but better when it happens to someone else :). The 3 taco carne asada plate was $15 and was awesome! It's not that the $13 taco would not be good, it's just that it's a taco!  It would be like putting a lift kit on Mini Cooper- you can but why?!     Go and enjoy... you will love it!"}
{"text":"Not just tacos and burritos! Excellent salads too ! My fave is kale and quinoa salad with grilled shrimp! Delish."}
{"text":"So first off, giving Sol a star for the food- they have good solid tacos.  Tried the carnitas, grilled fish, and breaded fish tacos, as well as the guacamole.  I would recommend all 4 items, and word on the street is that the ceviche does not suck at all.    Giving 1 more star for the service... and the studly eyecandy (I'm talking about our 2 hot bartenders)    Another star for the cool vibe and look of the place, awesome location in the Scottsdale Quarter.  Good for an after work happy hour, a hot date, or even lunch if you work in the area. Didn't have to wait for a table and there was even open seats at the bar.  One more star for the delicious margaritas and the five dollar off deal for checking in on Yelp!  Knocking off 1 star because happy hour ends at six p.m.  Boo, really?  And, lastly giving one more star because they do have a good taco Tuesday which goes on all evening, and consist of good deals on tacos and margaritas.    Long live taco Tuesday's!!  Tip- come by and check out the Sunday Brunch"}
{"text":"Fabulous spot. The goat cheese appetizer and coconut calamari is amazing! The Calamari is the best, fresh tasting and cool presentation, I've seen in the valley.   Highly recommended. Garrett made it even better. Personable, knowledge and fun. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Service is lacking here.  We walked in and had to push through a group of teenagers in the way blocking the hostess stand.  Once there the hostess was so focused on her phone that I had to ask 2x for her attention.  She said there was no wait for 2 people and just pointed at a table told me to just go there, ummm ok so I sat outside with my husband and not one person came by with menus or waters.  I got up and got my own menus then flagged a server down.  The server was very nice.     The food is good but overpriced for what you get.  Loved the chrizo and cheese dish it is a must for sharing.  I also got the fish tacos which were tasty but nothing special.  The rice was amazing however I wish they gave more than 1 tiny spoonful of it, the beans were good too but again we had 4 bites of beans so nut much there.     All in all I would say meh maybe just go for drinks and apps."}
{"text":"Hmmm, maybe it was a off night, but I was not impressed by this place at all.  I see a lot of good and positive reviews, so I'm giving this place the benefit of the doubt.  I thought the ambiance and environment was fun and inviting, but the food itself was very overrated and boring.  Maybe I'm bias cause my fiance's family owns a authentic Mexican restaurant and I've had so many great Mexican dishes recently, that this place paled in comparison.  This place is located in the corner of Greenway Hayden and Scottsdale road, right in Scottsdale Quarter.  This place is well decorated and looks like a fun place to go, but when you sample the food, the fun stops there!  The prices of this place is very expensive, especially for very simple Mexican dishes.  We stopped by on a Sunday evening, we had a pretty big group, cause it was my fiances brothers birthday.  The service was pretty good, so really no complaints, but it was the food that was the true let down.  We ordered some drinks to start out...and for appetizers we ordered some guacamole for the table.  The guacamole wasn't very tasty and for 9 bucks, you really only get a small sample.  They bring you out some chips and salsa and some sort of bean dip to nibble on while you're looking at the menu.  Since we had a big group, we all were chatting and waiting for others to arrive.  I literally looked at the menu for over 20 minutes and really nothing stood out  and it was very tough to decide.  The dinner menu was very limited, they had some dinner specials, which were very over priced and they had a taco section that they served ala carte.  I wasn't going to drop 8 to 12 bucks on one freaking taco, its principle of it.  So basically if you wanted two specialty tacos with rice and beans, it would of cost well over 20 bucks for a plate.  On the back of the menu they had dinner plates, but most dishes were over 15 and the options were very limited.  My lady ordered the three carne asada taco plate wih a side quesadilla and I ordered the pork carnitas  which was 20 bucks.  I was not impressed.  The meat was served in a little dish and the flavors were bland and the meat itself was barely warm.  It tasted like pulled pork without the smoke flavor.  Not to mention the huge glob of fat that came with it.  I seriously thought it was a joke.  I tried to add some flavors by adding hot salsa, onions and avocados, but the taste of the meat was just awful.  Overall the meal was a disaster.  I would give it a one star review, but the service was pretty good, and the ambiance was nice.   Overall, not my type of place.  Phoenix has tons of great places to try for Mexican food, but if you don't value money and want something different, give this place a try!  I would not recommend this place at all.  Maybe for happy hour and drinks, but definitely not for the food."}
{"text":"Didn't really care for the food, if you're anticipating  tradional Mexican food then it's not for you, more of a food truck Style.  Food was very bland and may adapt well to the Vegan diet.  And if you love fajitas, then this isn't the place for you.  I had the short rib taco,  only 1, less than a palm of your hand, $10.50.  The cost didn't throw as the taste of it.  I wouldn't recommend this restaurant.!!!"}
{"text":"Had shrimp taco dorado 3 small shrimp, black beans  could use some spice.  Taco had more mango salsa than shrimp.  Magarita was good."}
{"text":"Sat outside at the bar on a Sunday mid-day.  Had a choice between the brunch and lunch menu.  The bartender agreed that the fish taco's were the best choice and she was right.  Good flavor.  I was hungry and ordered two taco's ($8 each) plus the rice and beans.  I should have gone for just one after also getting the chips and salsa they provide.  All in all, a very good place, on the upscale side for a Mexican restaurant but everyone can feel at home here."}
{"text":"Food was very good and atmosphere was nice though  hard to hear across the tables in a big party. There is a $4 upcharge  to make your burrito enchilada style though  your waiter probably  won't  tell  you it's an upcharge and offer it as though it's a regular no charge option as ours did to our table."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love Sol and the food was really good! An extra bonus to our night was our server Arnoldo. He provided exceptional customer service and made our experience extra enjoyable! :)"}
{"text":"The service was fast an friendly.The waiter was very professional and checked on the table multiple times to make sure everything was okay. However the place feels very small and crowded. The appetizers were okay.the food was really light and tasty. We will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"This place was so good! We opted for the taco Tuesday menu which included 5$ regular margaritas and 6$ skinny. We both got skinny and were surprised how good they were. We also split the animale taco which had carne asada French fries onions and cilantro. Delicious I also tried the chicken street taco, it was made with chicken thigh which I'm not the biggest fan of but they were good."}
{"text":"we had an amazing dinner guacamole was so good I order some ceviche it was so good the shrimp tacos where amazing  , oh and my favorite sweet potatoes  chips , everything was really clean , Alberto took very good care of us I think he made our experience even better"}
{"text":"We had great food and great service. Our server was Lorena and she let us know happy hour was ending so we could order a drink at happy hour prices. Started with the coconut calamari and it was excellent. The fish of the day was grouper and it was also excellent. This will be on my list of restaurants to return to"}
{"text":"Good tacos.  Different. Nice atmosphere. Beer and wine were both good. Wait person not puking attention.   Rushed they drink order.  Not enough time to decide.  Annoyed I asked about happy hour."}
{"text":"Food was not worth the price. The waiter recommended things for us to get and they were all awful. Everything from the guacamole to the $10 individual tacos. My wife and I would have much rather have gone to Chipotle across the street and not paid $100."}
{"text":"Food and service were absolutely amazing! Server was extremely friendly and made great recommendations! Check this place out, they're awesome!"}
{"text":"We went here the other night and ordered some great food but it took a while for us to get it 25-30 min. Had to ask the bartender if he remembered to put it in.  Then after 20 30 min , we got our food. But never got out appetizer. , When I would ask for something it would literally take 15-20 minutes to get like an extra side of sauce out. I was eating slow trying to wait for it, then my food was cold by the time the sauce would come out.   So good food.   Sloooow service.  And forgetful bartender :(.  Think it would of been amazing if the staff was on point."}
{"text":"Really like this place. Excellent enchiladas and tacos, and a lively, yet still classy ambiance. However, I'm a bit of a salsa snob, and I must admit that for as good food as they have, their salsa leaves a bit to be desired."}
{"text":"The food was ok.  Waitress forgot my guacamole.  Wait staff continually bumped into our table.  Great wine list.  Nice decor.  I may or may not try again.  Not impressed by the food. Id go up to Narcisse or True Food instead."}
{"text":"Food was tasty. Service was standard. No military discount and they turned off the armed forces bowl to watch cops. Wow."}
{"text":"So disappointed. Met five friends here yesterday for lunch to celebrate a birthday and my entree was terrible. Let me preface this by first saying that my previous visits here have been good. I ordered something new: the shrimp taquitos from the appetizer menu. They were dripping in grease. When I picked one up and took a bit, my hands were very greasy. It was a bit disconcerting and unappealing. I thought about sending them back but the hassle in a large group wouldn't have been worth it. Don't order them! On the plus side, service was excellent. And they brought the birthday girl the cinnamon nachos with a candle."}
{"text":"The SOL guacamole is delicious! Avocado mixed with goat cheese, pepitas, onions, tomatoes, mango that they mix at your table. Delicious!!!!! Try the garlic ribeye taco, it's. The most delicious taco I've ever had. The canarditas duck confit tacos and the blackberry sauce were divine. The chille wrapped in bacon couldn't have been any better. Rodrigo, our server, was wonderful and helpful. We will be back. A+"}
{"text":"My friend and I came here after my appointment at Dolce last Sunday because it was right next door.  It was busy, and they had brunch items! Even better was the nice service (our waiter was really cool) and then they also had someone come perform! The musician was talent and hit the feels with the songs - he even sang a tune from The Little Mermaid. Major win, obviously.   They have a nice black bean dip (complimentary. And we shared the brioche/French toast/bread pudding item. Haha, it was really good. Not too sweet and plenty to share between us.   As far as drinks, I had the mango mimosa..again not too sweet because they use a purer instead of a syrup. My friend had this frozen margarita and mimosa mix, and she really like it!  Happy that we stumbled upon this place. :)"}
{"text":"Overall tasty!!  Had a good experience here - enjoyed the atmosphere (warm, not too loud) - and delicious complementary chips and dip!  The skinny margaritas were good but not strong; the vanilla and pineapple infused tequila/martini was great though!  Good service - would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Sooo good! The margaritas are great. The food is fantastic. Too many great options so we chose to start with the peel and eat shrimp as a shared appetizer. They were messy as expected and super tasty! The cheese could have been left off, we didn't think it added anything. Then we went with tacos so we could try several. All were great. We would come back anytime! Loved it, and the service was good too."}
{"text":"I went here late on a Sunday night. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the kitchen and bar was open until 10 PM on a Sunday.  I sat at the bar and had Kristen the bartender take care of me. She was excellent, great service!  They have an indoor and outdoor bar as well as a lot of tables. There's plenty of room in this restaurant.  The food tasted good, very fresh, and the service was fast. The drinks were pretty good, and I believe you get a better value by getting the large margarita versus the regular size margarita.    Things can get expensive here quickly, especially if you enjoy a few of their margaritas.   Overall this was good food, good drinks, a very friendly atmosphere and great service."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, friendly service and the food is fresh and tasty varieties of traditional Mexican dishes.  Love the frozen beer."}
{"text":"This was our first time for me and my husband. We decided to stop by on our way home on a Tuesday evening. Place is very nice. The front desk ladies were polite and welcoming. They forgot to give the Tuesday special for the tacos but our waitress Deborah was amazing, polite, friendly, knowledgeable and quick with the service. She helped us out with our selections, always kept an eye on our refills. I ordered chicken and carne asada tacos and my husband ordered shrimp and fish tacos with the side of rice and beans. Deborah brought some chips with salsa and bean dip for us to start with.  Both were great. Rice were better than the black beans. This was a great meal for the great price and the awesome service. I would love to go back for another taco tuesday!! Cant wait and I hope I get another server just like Deborah, if not her again for the great experience!!!"}
{"text":"My most favorite restaurant!! Everything is top notch!  Carne asada, the red rice, black bean sweet potato tacos and goat cheese guacamole are all amazing."}
{"text":"Not only do i love that they have yelp specials for margaritas, their margaritas are awesome!  I am a \"skinny\" margarita myself but they have a huge assortment of margaritas and tequilas that there is something for everyone.  aside from the goodstuff is the other good stuff- their food!  Their salsa which I believe is made on site, is delicious!  I didnt quite caremuch for the black bean dip but thats just my preference.  The staff is quite attentive and will refil your chips beforeyou realize you even need a refill.  The menu has a good selection but not overwhleming; I like the fried fish tacos, personally.  At night time, I did find the lighting to be a little too dark and actually had to get my iphone out to read the menu.  But overall it was a great experience and I look forward to going back."}
{"text":"Very good and interesting atmosphere. I had the pork carnitas dinner and it was great! Open kitchen is fun. I would return."}
{"text":"For the last several years this has been, and continues to be my favorite restaurant in town for great Baja style Mexican food and margaritas. Try the hot and rot tropical ceviche, naked guacamole, and the cucumber jalapeño margaritas. Service in the bar area can be hit or miss; I have found better service if you sit back at the regular tables. I bring both friends and clients here for dinners on a regular basis. The place is always very clean, the staff friendly, and the restrooms immaculate. While there are several restaurants at the Quarter, I continue to rate this one the highest. Salud!"}
{"text":"Food was great and the margaritas were spectacular!  The table service was incredibly slow.  After being seated we sat at the table for 10 min and no waters, no drink orders...  We ended going up to the bar where Lauren the other bar tenders made some amazing recommendations for margaritas.  When re-seated Israel did a great job with great service.  The tacos are great.  They are big so watch out!  Two is perfect.  I will go back for the drinks for sure."}
{"text":"There's nothing I didn't like about this restaurant. The ambiance is great, server (Zac) was knowledgeable and friendly,  food was delicious and the signature drinks was good too.  My husbad and I ordered the sweet corn (similar to elotes) for our appetizer. I ordered the pork carnitas (gluten free) and my husband ordered steak, fish and shrimp tacos (a la carte). We liked everything."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere last night ... local music bartender was fantastic. Drinks were great. Chips beans and salsa were wonderful."}
{"text":"We have been here two times. Both were fun, enjoyable and food great! The place is modern and upscale. Bit loud on a busy night. Had the fresh watermelon margarita, delish! Had the Mexican shrimp really good. We will be back."}
{"text":"Been here twice and disappointed both times.  Food is OK. Guac is over priced. Specialty cocktails way too sweet. Staff not very personable ... I would actually go as far as to say continuously weeded and awkward.  Went there a few nights ago with family and friends and we literally sat there and chatted for an hour before I finally made eye contact with our waitress like \"HEY WE'RE READY\". Just because we're talking doesn't mean we're not hungry.  She was running around all night just looking way too busy.  Tortilla soup tasteless. Ensalada Sol was good, but I could've made a better salad at home for half the price.. Want to add chipotle shrimp? Don't. Also tasteless and no spice at all.  Apparently the enchiladas and street tacos are good.  Also, the apparent manager reaches over our table to turn on the electric candle... Without saying a word. We all stop to look at him since we had no idea who he was and why he were reaching across the table turning on the candle and then walking away. Try something like \"Hi! My name is soandso, and I'm the manager here. How are those margaritas?\" ... While reaching for the candle. Or better yet, TURN THEM ALL ON BEFORE DINNER SERVICE ;)   Customer service isn't bad, just weird. Hostesses are friendly opening doors and what not, but when you mention its still happy hour you should give us happy hour menu's as well and there are tables near the door, hold off on the personal chitchat, because I don't care what you're doing later tonight.  ALL SUMMED UP: Food: overpriced (not saying it's totally bad, but it's OVERPRICED) Service: inexperienced staff and way too casual for The Quarter (use proper verbiage, make eye contact, and SMILE... advice applicable to everyone working there, except the young boy who always refilled my water :) Atmosphere: trendy.  I'll go to Chipotle next time."}
{"text":"If I could give a negative star I would....horrible service. On a wed night took them 20 minutes to take our drink order and then after getting our drinks our waiter never came back to take our order. After waiting 25 minutes we flagged someone down and paid our bill. Keep driving past this place not worth it."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place - and I did - this is more of a 3.5 that I couldn't bring myself to round up.  I've been here several times. I've ordered several of the fish dishes (fish sandwich, fish tacos) and been pretty impressed, but just not blown away.  The cold ceviche is also quite good.   Our meal came with free chips and salsa, which was a nice added bonus.  The service was okay. It's ranged from the standard \"good\" to slightly sleazy.  I'm not sure if this is just a Scottsdale thing, but I went to lunch with three (male) coworkers. I ordered a margarita at lunch and the waiter, a younger guy, put his hand on my shoulder and asked if I liked my drink. I just thought it was super weird, but I might be overreacting."}
{"text":"Service was great considering they were busy. Really fast seating and our server was a great conversationalist. Had to leave early but will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place was great. Good food and service, along with some free parking in a upscale shopping area. The Sol guac with mango was delicious and so was the coconut calamari. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Blah blah blah what's all the hype about.  Ordered the grilled corn it was cooked perfectly with just enough sauce to piss you off.  Anyone with common sense would serve it with a side of sauce or at least more than the tiny squirt they give you.  Ordered the $18.00 taco plate each taco graciously stuffed with a full tablespoon of meat- what a joke.  Our food was cold and nats where constantly landing in our salsa bowls.  The server Sandra did an excellent job and you can tell she truly believes in the food unfortunately it's overpriced for the portions and lacking flavor and temperature.  There are many other Mexican food places I would visit prior to a return here.  Service and atmosphere are excellent minus the bugs food is C-.  The  couple sitting next to us ordered a sandwich to share the each took one bite  commented on how bad it was and left.  The Carne Asada Tacos had decent flavor and had its moments but nearly every bite was interrupted by a hard piece of chewy fat or something nasty."}
{"text":"Loved the ambiance, loved the food- particularly their coconut crusted stuffed calamari.  This appetizer is heaven.  Sea bass ceviche is delicious, goat cheese balls, mushrooms tacos, guacamole and black beans with pepitas.  All good.   Margaritas were good and strong.  Had a great time at the Yelp event hosted by SOL.  I just can't get that stuffed calamari out of my mind........  Perhaps I won't even sleep tonight thinking about it...... Yup.  A strong possibility."}
{"text":"This place is awesome the queso the guac and the tortilla soup are off the hook... And ask for Arnoldo he's an amazing waiter!!!"}
{"text":"If Chipotle served margaritas then this place would be out of business. I was not impressed with anything. The one feature that I liked about the restaurant was part of the building design...the light mist on the outdoor dining.   Food flavor was mediocre. Ambiance was eh. Menu selection was limited."}
{"text":"Popped into Sol Mexican Cocina before a movie one night for Happy Hour.  We were seated quickly, which was great because there was only 15 minutes left for happy hour and we wanted to get our order in before it ended.  Our waitress was SOOO... nice!  She had a great personality and was attentive and informative, pretty much everything you would want in a waitress.  We ordered everything off the happy hour menu, so I can't comment on the main menu, but the happy hour food was great!  The Hubs and I shared the pork tacos and chicken tacos - he loved the chicken and I loved the pork - go figure.  We shared guacamole, which was good, but needed a bit more seasoning.  By adding the salsa, which was served with it, it became quite good.  BTW, love the unique \"chips\" that are served here... some of our had a ton of seasoning and others had only a little - we liked the ones with just a little.  We also shared the empanadas (I think that's what they were), anyway they were really good.  Overall, we had a great happy hour experience here.  It thoroughly redeemed my not so enthusiastic impression from the Yelp event here (just about the food, not the event).  I can't say enough great things about our waitress - can't remember her name, but she was awesome.  I am sure we will be back soon to try out their main menu."}
{"text":"Hey Hey Hey all my peeps if you want a great experience head on over to sol!!! Great drinks , great atmosphere and delicious food . A burst of flavor that pop in your mouth !!!"}
{"text":"My first restaurant visit in Scottsdale was very memorable.  Sol has top notch service with a unique take on traditional chips and dip as starters.  We added the fresh guacamole and were not disappointed. I had the Big Mex salad as a main course and it is one of the best I've ever had.  I hope I have the opportunity to visit again."}
{"text":"SOL Mexican Cocina gets a deserved strong rating from this Yelper!   With a SOL location less than 10 miles from where I live it is funny I had to leave the state to try their brand of Mexican for the first time, bit I am glad I did. I found myself at SOL to attend a business dinner in their backroom with several of co-workers recently and to be fair, the visit was almost entirely positive. The service was both professional and nimble and the kitchen seemed to be firing on all cylinders throughout my meal.  The Guacamole SOL was a Tequila laced version of this Mexican favorite and featured mango, goat cheese, pepitas peppered with cilantro.  The mango adds a nice fresh and acidic kick that really calmed down the Tequila's edge.   For an entree, I decided on trying the grilled Kobe Skirt Steak which arrived cooked to the perfect medium rare. A \"Waygu-style\" (read: NOT Kobe) cut ot Skirt Steak is plated along with a cilantro sauce, tomatillo salsa, grilled cebollitas & avocado. I was impressed; the steak was juicy and delicious, something I seem to ever be able to find at Mexican themed establishments. In fact, I was nervous ordering but alas, SOL came through in spades.   One area of concern with SOL would be in the mixed drinks department as the Bourbon drinks we a tad weak and the Margarita tasted like something you would get in a red cup on a college campus. I switched to IPA quickly to curb disappointment.   SOL Mexican Cocina is one of those 3 to 4 star \"tweeners\" but I figure the service and fact they actually know how to cook a steak medium rare deserves rounding up."}
{"text":"Good food. Loved the chips, salsa and the beans. The corn was so yummy! I had a pork carnitas burrito. It was very good."}
{"text":"If I could do zero stars I would have. Felt ignored by the bartender Gio. I sent back back corn tortillas with the appetizer, why not warn me your tacos were only corn tortillas. Then you ignored me and I couldn't even order a replacement meal. Excellent food, terrible service. So bumbed was really looking forward to this place."}
{"text":"Great restaurant for date night. Fantastic ambience, helpful service, outstanding margaritas (try the Watermelon - it was so refreshing) & delicious food. Interesting spin on Mexican - enjoyed the grilled corn & Sol Guac appetizers & tacos. Black bean sides are to die for. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time last night and I have to say... I am not a fan. I went with a friend of mine and when we first arrived they said it would be an hour in a half wait. We decided to put our name in and go sit at the bar (and if we got tired of waiting we would just go somewhere else). We ordered our first drinks. I bought the house margarita... and it was one of the worst tasting margaritas I have ever had. Normally with margaritas they are to sour... but this margarita tasted like straight tequila. I asked them to add some sour mix and the bartender looked at me like I had 10 heads (and he didnt do it). He pretended not to hear me. We only had to wait about an hour to be seated. The ambiance of the restaurant is great. The service was great as well. But the food was so so. The guacamole is tasteless and they give these crazy homemade tortilla looking hollow disks. When I tried to break the tortilla up, it just crumbled into crumbs. It was nearly impossible to eat the guac with these things. All I wanted was some real chips. I ended up getting beer battered fish tacos and they were decent... just not wonderful. The portion size was decent. Overall... I wont be going back anytime soon. I am sure that there are better mexican restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. Nice place with a live cover band playing 90s hits and a friendly bartender.  Food had great flavor and I highly recommend the panuchos and sweet corn appetizers."}
{"text":"Boo. I hate being disappointed and Sol did just that. The patio is great but close to Scottsdale Road so you are hearing the constant traffic. Not even the music (which was a great touch) could block it out. I don't like cilantro so call me stupid for going to a \"Mexican Cocina\" but when I tell most places if they can make something without cilantro they are accommodating. Here I was told that the chef doesn't like making changes to his recipes. Finally after us pleading with our waiter, he asked the kitchen and they were able to make us a cilantro-less guacamole that was actually quite tasty and is served with some yummy tostadas. For my entree I had some form of a shrimp cocktail that was decent and my friend had his $20 something lobster tacos that he had 2 bites of and said they were so bland they weren't worth eating. I would come back for one of their margaritas which looked delicious but that's about it."}
{"text":"We ate here on Saturday for lunch, and it was o-k...nothing extra special.  Atmosphere - was fun.  I was seated by the bathrooms, so probably not the best place - there was a lot of traffic."}
{"text":"Live music Sunday mornings for brunch!! Great vibe and $3 mimosas!  If you find yourself eating dinner there, you can enjoy authentic platillos such as Shrimp Chile Relleno, Pollo con Rajas, or some Carne Estofado.   You receive great, fun service whether you sit at the bar or grab a table..."}
{"text":"Went here last night with a friend and had a perfect dinner out! The food was AMAZING and the service was SPECTACULAR!! Rodrigo was such a delight and very knowledgeable."}
{"text":"If you come here you have got to try the Sloppy Jose and a frozen beer! We came in today for the first time and Veronica was our server on the patio and she was great...we will totally be back."}
{"text":"\"I can't move the sun.\"   Second time here. First time we just had very rude service. This time it was one of the worst I've ever experienced.  We were seated in the bar area. Restaurant not too busy. Plenty of other seats. The sun was blinding my friend's wife and it finally was too much. We very politely asked to be moved and it was an ordeal. 5 or 6 people involved and ultimately the short haired blonde woman said rudely,   \"We can't move the sun. It will be gone in 5 minutes.\"   Wow. I know, right? I can't believe we stayed after that. There were so many empty seats not in the sun. Just her attitude was really unusually bad and I'm as laid back a guy as they come.  Then one of the 4 entrees was wrong. Not a huge deal. They were nice and quickly brought out the correct dish.  At the beginning of our meal I ordered a jalapeño cucumber margarita. Supposed to be delicious. Once our meal was over I figured they just forgot about it. No big deal. As we were about to get the check, the same short haired blonde women brought the drink. This is 15 minutes later mind you. She knew I was going to ask her to take it back.  \"Really???\" she said as rude as they come with a loud gasp and a sigh.   She did take the drink back.  Then I asked the same short haired blonde woman for our check. She said ... \"GOOD.\" - Wow, I know. She said good when I asked nicely for our check. I said, \"Excuse me?\" and she then said quietly, \"Sure.\"  I can't believe it. Still left 20% tip as the main waitress was nice and it wasn't her fault that her surrounding staff were all the rudest people you'll meet.   The food is great , but I will never go back there again. You couldn't pay me to go back again. I love mexican food , like to tip nicely, and live up the street. What a shame they couldn't put people in the restaurant who even had a mild interest in being there."}
{"text":"Had the fish tacos. They were nothing special .  Had them sent back because there was no flavor to them. Cocktails were good. Too small and overpriced. Probably will never return to this restaurant. We were very disappointed."}
{"text":"Awesome guacamole. Vampiro taco is a must have. good beer and tequila selection"}
{"text":"This was one of our least favorite meals in AZ. It's sort of non traditional Mexican food...like they took your favorites and tried to get fancy, resulting in a twist we didn't really like. For example, they give you a brown sauce instead of salsa for your chips. Plus a lot of the chips come out looking burnt, but it's a seasoning they use that makes them taste different. Great location, cool restaurant, but wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Best Mexican place I've ever eaten at. Nothing else to say; try it and you'll be convinced too."}
{"text":"Fine location, fine dinning, for vegetarians less choices but veggies quesadilla is the best I ever had."}
{"text":"Really top quality Mexican fare and fairly priced. Great location with lots of seating and very nice Happy Hour with a really nice bartender. Get the peel and eat shrimp!"}
{"text":"Margaritas are overly sweet.  Service is annoying and average.  But worst of all this place could kill you.  Despite being a supposed high end Mexican restaurant it seems they feel the need to fry the chips and taco shells in the same oil that they fry the shrimp.  Who does this?   If you have a shellfish allergy your out in half the menu.  If you don't, you can enjoy that lovely fried shrimp flavor.  The rest of the food is mediocre at best.  Skip this chain and find a local legit place.   Not worth the hassle."}
{"text":"They may be known for their speciality drinks but as the food goes it is by far the WORST Mexican/Latin food I have had anywhere. It is way over priced and poor quality. Don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"Every visit we've had really good food and great service. Chips are just okay though. Otherwise a great place for a date night."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this restaurant for a while and it did not disappoint!   The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the \"chips\" ... I know they want to different, but those huge tortillas just don't cut it for me.  They are huge and hard...I prefer them thin and crispy.  Other than that... the food and service were great! Beautiful decor, the goat cheese enchiladas were amazing, and the rice was the bomb!"}
{"text":"I don't eat dairy so I asked for the tortilla soup without cheese. It had giant spoonfuls of melted cheese under the broth on the bottom of the bowl. The business associate I met with for lunch was completely out of water as well. The restaurant wasn't very busy to be ignoring drinks. By the time the waiter came back, I just said to forget it. I don't understand how hard it is to do \"no cheese\". I hope I don't get sick."}
{"text":"Dining alone is not always fun but can be enjoyable- even if it was Saturday night.  The staff did a great job to make me feel welcome.   Chips, salsa & beans arrived. Both had good flavor but no heat. Was given some in house haberno  sauce, which was all it needed. The chips were whole corn tortillas. Too big for my taste and a little sharp on inside of mouth.   My chipolte  shrimp salad was terrific with no dressing. Used some of the salsa instead. Shrimp were a little on the small side but not overcooked. The roasted corn and other veggies on a bed of arugula had lots of flavor.  The salad was HUGE. Picture a box of arugula in the grocery store. Easily shared by 4 people as a starter.   Tried to order a margarita with their special reposado but not sure what happened. Just asked for tequila, aa little lime juice and salt. Nothing else. The result was disappointing. It tasted like lime juice with a splash of tequila.  Inquired with server, but he said it was prepared exactly as I asked.  No offer for anything else.   Will go again during my visit."}
{"text":"Came here hungry after flying in from the east coast. Ate early around 4:30 and it was not crowded. Started with a big basket of fresh chips and salsa. Watch out because salsa has a kick! I had a shrimp Chile relleno with a nice side of rice and beans. Plenty of vegetarian options that my family loved. Would definitely go back"}
{"text":"First of all, best Mojitos! It's hard to find a good Mojito in this town for some reason, but Sol does it right. The tacos are great and the ambiance is way cool. The service was a little slow and we had to ask for our server a couple times. We were there on a Monday night and it was not very busy so I'm not sure what the deal was there. I have been in on the weekends as well but have only sat at the bar, which is cool as it's one that's inside/outside. They're typically packed on the weekends and I would recommend a reservation. Overall great spot in the Quarter for Mexican with an upscale feel without the upscale price!"}
{"text":"We came for the Happy Hour specials and we really enjoyed it! The Skinny Margaritas were tasty enough for seconds. We had the tacos and the corn as well as the watermelon copitas. The watermelon had a very interesting Mexican salty sauce with limes that finished it well. Very refreshing! Our waitress, Kassandra, recommended the corn and took it off the cob as the table, a nice touch. It complimented the tacos well and was a great sharing dish. Kassandra did a great job with our table, explaining the specialties and making great recommendations! We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place has a convenient location in Scottsdale Quarter.  We walked up asking for a table and were told it would be about 20 minutes.  We found a couple of seats at the bar right away and were able to get served very quickly there.  The house margarita was a good choice.  We ordered street tacos for our dinner.  My wife had carne asada and I had carnitas.  Both were very good.  I will say we were surprised that they had quite a bit of heat to them for this being more of a commercial restaurant rather than local/authentic.    Our bartender did a nice job getting our drinks made and the food came out quickly.  The restaurant was very busy with nearly all the tables and seats full.  We would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Had lunch here last week on a whim. My friend and I wanted Mexican and it had good reviews. I had the shrimp and avocado salad and it was very good. I didn't like the overly large thick chips. They were lacking in flavor as was the salsa. I didn't think the two salsas were that good. The table side guacamole was good but also on the bland side. Vibe wise the place was nice. I would have given 4 stars if the chips, salsa and guacamole were really stellar. I would eat there again."}
{"text":"This was honestly so incredibly delicious. Drinks were on point. I loved the bean dip. My favorite app was the shrimp. Really good food and excellent service."}
{"text":"I love this place or I should say I love their ceviche!  If you like ceviche, you MUST try the Hot and Raw Tropical Ceviche; it is amazing!  Also, be conservative when adding in the fresh diced habanero pepper that comes on top....it will sneak up on you as you get to the bottom of the bowl.   If you are not into spice Sol has, I think, four kinds of ceviche and I highly recommend 3 of them (not a fan of the shrimp one).  Another brownie point for Sol is their complimentary, yummy, unique 'chips and salsa'.  Many Mexican places have moved more towards making you pay for the chips and salsa, so I appreciate them keeping with my all-time favorite Mexican restaurant tradition :)  I have had a few of their entrees as well and the food is superbly made and beautifully presented.  They definitely add a little extra 'Sol flare' to all their food, which usually isn't a bad thing, but you should not be expecting 'traditional' Mexican food while dining at Sol.  My servers and bartenders have always been knowledgeable about the food and pleasant- the other reason I keep coming back apart from the ceviche!  In terms of ambiance this is definitely chic for a Mexican Restaurant- no tacky bright decor and neon lights here!  The patio is also very inviting with misters during the hot summers and it is attached to one side of the bar, making it rather lively if it is hopping.    My one complaint about Sol is the prices are a bit steep for Mexican food (around $13 for 3 tacos, entrees $15-$30 & house margarita $8+), but I guess they do have to pay rent at the Scottsdale Quarter so I will cut them slack on that.  I should also mention they have a decent happy hour from 3-6 everyday, so if you are on a tighter budget you should go then.  Unfortunately my favorite, the Hot and Raw Ceviche, is not on the Happy Hour menu."}
{"text":"Started lunch with the guacamole and it was probably the best we have ever had. We then tried the street tacos, I had pork and the wife had beef. We thought they were ok, maybe could have been a little spicier. Service was very attentive without being too assertive. Will eat here again."}
{"text":"In scottsdale on a work vacation and lucked upon this place during dinner break. The food was great and the service was fantastic. Our server was engaging and efficient and she steered us towards great choices. She comped us a guac starter upon discovering we were visitors from the north and it really set the mood for a fantastic dinner."}
{"text":"I have come here several times in the last year and each time is as good as the last.  The food is just enjoyable, I always get the shrimp taco's.  Staff are always nice and very helpful.  They have  nice outdoor seating although we stay inside it looks very nice especially at this time of year.  Unless something drastic changes, I plan on going back."}
{"text":"This place is a little pricey for Mexican, so hubby and I went for Happy Hour to check it out, and we loved it! Friendly, professional staff and a nice, upscale environment. Excellent Baja-style food -- fresh and flavorful, with no cheddar cheese! Tacos were a highlight, as was the guac. Of course, Margaritas are not Mexican but we enjoyed our share of those, too. We'll for sure be back, and this will be the place we'll take out of town guests who have a yen for Mexican."}
{"text":"Amazing food but service is a tad lackluster. Been here many times and the bartenders ignore customers! No eye contact, walk away, etc.  The food and ambience makes up for the service."}
{"text":"My my my. YUM. I consider myself a Tortilla Soup aficionado and HANDS DOWN theirs is the BEST EVER. Flavors of salsa, sides, soup, tacos..... fresh and inventive.  And our bill was crazy affordable.  Awesome happy hour offering. Service was friendly and attentive. In short,  our new favorite Mexican restaurant!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came to beautiful Arizona for a weekend gateway and decided to try this restaurant based on the reviews. We came to Arizona without our children and were looking forward to a nice sit down dinner to celebrate our anniversary.  We walked in and were received by the hostess who (1)didn't welcome us, (2)was so serious as if she wasn't happy that we had walked in, (3)a simple \"hello\" would have been nice. I have worked in restaurants before and it's very important to acknowledge the customer(s) and make them feel welcome and she did the opposite. I totally understand that we all have our bad days but it's important not to make others feel unwelcome.  The Food was amazing and our waiter was very helpful. I was debating between the Mexx salad and the Corn, poblano & mushroom taco plate so our waiter suggested that I get the salad and top it with corn, poblano & mushroom. The salad was perfect!!! All the ingredients came together nicely and I can truly say that it's one of the best salads I've ever had My husband ordered the Chicken Desmadres plate and he was very satisfied. Once again the food was amazing and I would definitely recommend this place. It would have been a 5 star review if it hadn't been for the hostess."}
{"text":"Feeling sad, let down by the world? Despondent over a recent hangnail or paper cut? Angry that your boss ignored your fine work yet again? All of these and countless more would be fine reasons to come to SOL and have a Mango Con Chile Frozen Margarita. Sweet, spicy, goes down real smooth. And then you need to have another. And then another. And then another. Unrelatedly, you should definitely have someone drive you here and away from here.  The food was good, I think. I was drunk, I don't really remember. I think I recall it being good. There was some shrimp appetizer where you have to pull off the shrimp's heads. Hey, they're already dead, I say. They don't feel it. They had some delicious corn appetizer, too, and then these cool taco things you can get a la carte or grouped for you, if I recall correctly. Again, I was drunk.  Nice ambiance, friendly waiter. And yeah, get that drink or three of them."}
{"text":"Had the street corn app and sweet potato/black bean taco. Both were awesome! Great atmosphere too."}
{"text":"For me the highlight was the sweet potato and black bean tacos... I am not a vegetarian at all but these things were amazing!  The black bean dip they give you with the chips and salsa is fantastic.  Come topped with pepitas and has a smooth smokey flavor.  The chips are fine but forgettable unless you top them with the dip.  Service is really good which for me is a major draw.  A place with bad service will never survive so these guys are good to go."}
{"text":"I'm far too impatient to wait the wait that's necessary to get a table for dinner or late night service, but I've enjoyed many lunches here. My co-workers and I love the pomegranate and traditional guacamole and chips. I've had their pork and fish tacos and love them both. My favorite is really their black beans. So yummy! They're a little pricey but definitely a great choice when you're looking for something with a Mexican flair near the Quarter."}
{"text":"SO OVERPRICED. Service was good, the food wasn't anything special. We shared a shrimp burrito and out bill was still outrageous for what it was. The chips are whole tortillas which makes eating awkward, you have to break them or *gasp* double dip ;)"}
{"text":"My sisters and best friends decided to have a girls trip to Scottsdale. We wanted to try Sol and are we ever so glad we did! The ambiance was relaxing and inviting. Not to mention the inside was beautifully decorated. Now for the best part....the food!!!! All 7 of us girls ordered different dishes and we loved everything. I ordered the chipotle ribeye and it was cooked to perfection. The short rib entree was so tender and flavorful. If you're considering trying a restaurant in Scottsdale. Service was on point. Thank you Sol staff :)"}
{"text":"Came in for a drink and some great food. Service was great. Thanks Alberto. We'll be back"}
{"text":"This restaurant has great food and ambiance... although unless you want to pay top dollar for mediocre good and drinks you better get there before 6pm for the happy hour which does have quite a good a nice array of tasty items ti choose from. The Firecracker Chicken Quesadilla is definitely gonna light u up and my husband enjoyed the tacos... he liked the octopus one the best!! The quac and shrimp were my favorite."}
{"text":"Alberto was our server and he was fantastic! Very attentive and informative of the menu. The skinny marg was strong and fresh tasting with fresh squeezed lime juice. Got the special guac which was great and the fish and steak tacos. All was good! Would come back again!"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to this place having eaten at their Newport Beach location. I was mildly disappointed. The Newport location is much better and the value of the food relative to the price is poor. While the food was good, it wasn't great. The price was too expensive for Mexican food - you're paying for their overhead rather than the food."}
{"text":"I went there for some drinks Wally was my bartender the dudes knowledge on margaritas was about inflated as his ego the man can make a mean margarita and make a conversation with anyone Great service great drinks great food"}
{"text":"The goat cheese appetizer is my favorite thing ever! They're vegetarian tacos are super flavorful and the fish is always fresh and delicious. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! Our waiter was great! Plenty of mimosas and amazing food. The goat cheese appetizer is the best thing ever."}
{"text":"Best fish taco in town by far! Everything is fresh and delicious and Arnoldo is a wonderful host. If you have not tried this, you are missing out."}
{"text":"Service was outstanding !  Food was delicious.  I had the carnitas tacos.  My son had the kids bean burrito and it was huge for a child portion.  My husband had both of the fish tacos. The breaded ones were better.  My daughter had the chicken tacos they were a little dry.  However, the meat was grilled so that is to be expected.  The chips and salsa were good too.  Everything was homemade.  Will go back soon"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, food good/average, service mediocre, great salsa! Definitely order the sol guacamole with the mango, tequila and goat cheese. Missing one star due to waitress taking way too long to check on us throughout our meal and the food was all good but not \"wow\" for a foodie. I wish I could give it 3.5 since I feel 3 is unfair and 4 is too generous. 4 it is."}
{"text":"Great central Mexico food. I had the shrimps tacos which are flat out flavor. I have had many dishes here and all are good. Keep in mind, this is not a typical Mexican joint. It is higher in price and unique flavors.   Drawback is the chips and salsa, good, just not what I crave.   Plus is a very cool vibe and amazing flavors. Also, great margs."}
{"text":"Our group of five had a very good experience at Sol. Great atmosphere and service, but expect to spend $30 for a drink and entree. Their chips and been dip are excellent!"}
{"text":"So disappointing!  We have eaten here two previous times and it was wonderful, so we were anxious to bring our guests who were visiting from NY here for a great meal. Virtually everything was off. The service staff appeared to be confused about who would be taking our orders, serving our drinks and bringing our food to the table. Consequently, some of the drinks that we ordered never arrived and we received our food orders in shifts!  We were a table of six. Three people were served their meals first. 18 minutes later the other three orders were brought to the table. One of the fish tacos was so raw, it was more like sushi. When our guest finally tracked down a waitress and showed her the taco the waitress agreed it was nearly raw and said she would like to show it to the chef. Taking the plate along with the utensils she went to the kitchen. She returned a short time later and expressed with some exasperation the chef said \"some people like it that way, but he will cook another one the way it should be\".  Really?  Shouldn't that have been the goal the first time? A taco appeared about 10 minutes later, but now she had no silverware. Fortunately one of the other guests had a somewhat clean fork. Since we were all finished, she ate alone while we waited for her.  I can't help but wonder if their is a new chef and an absent manager. What a shame."}
{"text":"What do I start with..!?! This just hit a spot.. great atmosphere, great service... food was so delicious!! My favorite mexican joint in Scottsdale from now on.. it's a must to try.. don't forget to order margaritas!!"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough how much I enjoyed my food at this restaurant. I grew up in AZ and am quite picky about my Mexican food and this place impressed me. It's not traditional Sonoran Mexican food, but trust me you won't be disappointed. We started with fresh guacamole, which of course was amazing. I had the carnitas street tacos with rice and beans. This was hands down the BEST most flavorful carnitas I have ever had in my life. So delicious! I'm not usually very impressed with rice and beans, but the flavor infused in these was so good. Just the right amount of spice to give a good amount of heat. I wanted to lick my plate clean! I loved it all. The service was also wonderful, our waiter was awesome. This place is a must try"}
{"text":"Came back and was a bit disappointed.  We sat on the patio and were forgotten about for long periods of time.  The tacos weren't as good as the last time and the burnt shell chips were just as bad and even more oily than the last time.  For the price and quality this place just isn't all that great.  Not sure we would come back again.  The michelada was good.  Thats a plus."}
{"text":"Food did not sit well with our group a few of them were sick the next day. Could have been an off night but we won't be back."}
{"text":"SOL Mexican Cocina was recommended by a local. It's located in the Scottsdale Quarter next to the garage. We went here on a weeknight and there were plenty of parking. The parking was free and valet option was available. They had initially told us that there were a 20 minutes wait; however, we were seated within 3 minutes.   They had a vast selection of margaritas but the beer selection was poor. I can't drink margaritas (tequila = poison to my body) but my friend's margarita looked really good. I had the Carne Asada Burrito. It was the size of a small baby. I was able to bring at least half the burrito home as leftovers, really good as leftovers! The server offered us an option to have it like an enchilada and have the sauce all over the burrito. I definitely took her up on that.  Overall, the service was good and dinner was pricey. $24 with food, beer, and tip. I suppose it's reasonable since this is located in an upscale dining and shopping area. I would come back!"}
{"text":"Top grade margaritas, and some excellent guacamole and ceviche.  Also, the tortilla chips are huge and flavorful.  A fun place, and I had chicken ensamole (might be misspelled--it was an enchilada with mole sauce) and that was awesome. Something I'd never had in a Mexican place before."}
{"text":"I just had the duck taco dish.  Basically you get a duck leg and thigh  three tacos, avocado, onions, an orange slice and a blackberry/tequila/errrano sause .  You break up the duck and build the taco DELICOUS  Add some of the pomegranete guac on it and u have a great meal."}
{"text":"First and foremost, the only reason I gave this place a one star rating was because the decor was pleasant to the eye and the owner and or manager came by to refill our drinks. The meal was pedestrian, the wait staff was curt and only polite because it was their job. Finally the hostess hated her life and had an attitude problem because of it. Will not be returning, worst experience I've had. Don't come here,  go to chipotle instead."}
{"text":"Delishious food in a great atmosphere.  Rodrigo was most accommodating and very pleasant.  Would definitely recommend and would come back!"}
{"text":"This fresh spin on classic Mexican dishes make this place worth the trip. The menu is sprinkled with all the wonderful foods one who grew up in the south would attribute to that oh so delicious Mexican food they came to enjoy growing up. However, the rich seasoning, zesty sauces, and overall lack of salt make the dishes feel like the splash of jumping into a cold spring on a devilishly hot summer day. I like to get the cheese enchiladas, but let me tell you, my friends, Dorothy is far off the path of yellow brick cheese with these babies. They're rich and creamy but the balance that the verde sauce brings to the concoction edges off the deep lethargic that comes with overindulgence. Also, the balance of corn tortillas and goat cheeses leave your belly full, without the typical gastro-regrets that follow Mexican food. No sir this is not your typically cheap, greasy, Mexican food place. That being said, the waitress admitted to a lot of their dishes being pre concocted and thereby unalterable because of that. So if you are traveling with allergies, or aversions, keep in mind these delicious dishes are not very customizable. Furthermore, no salt goes into anything, they do bring a small plate of it to the table for your convenience. But as previously mentioned don't come here expecting greasy, salty, delicious Mexican dishes.. Instead, meet their estranged sisters who carry delicate, intentional flavors into your favorite labeled dishes."}
{"text":"I love this place!! The mango and goat cheese guacamole is a must. If you want to have Mexican food with a\"twist\" this is your place. The outside patio is great and the service is fantastic."}
{"text":"The chilaquiles verde for brunch is Amazing with the country potatoes, a nice mimosa and great company from the bartenders nick and mike!"}
{"text":"The best mexican restaurant in the entire arizona! The tacos, salad, drinks, and the desert was spectacular! I definitely recommend this place if you want to try good mexican food! Looks Lovely inside and the waiter and manager honestly gave us the best service!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a taco tuesday spot near our hotel and found this restaurant on Yelp although I did not see their taco tuesday specials.  We came for dinner around 6pm and found a spot on the third level of the park structure.  We were seated immediately and were pleasantly surprised to see the taco tuesday menu!    Our server was friendly and brought out some chips. We started off with some margaritas which were around $5-7 each.  The chips were delicious! We loved them and even asked for a 2nd basket. We didn't end up finishing because our tacos were brought out shortly after.  I had 2 carne asada and 2 carnitas street tacos with only onions and cilantro. My coworkers also ordered the carnitas, chicken, and shrimp cocktel.  We all enjoyed the food, especially the carnitas and finished everything!  Our bill came to about $45 which wasn't too bad and we left feeling happy and satisfied! Great choice for some tacos if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Fairly pricey Mexican food...except on good ole Taco Tuesday. The lemon chicken tacos were 2 for $3 and I should have gotten four. Big strips of white chicken, some onions and lemon flavor make these tacos simple, but very satisfying. We also tried the naked guac and a couple of $5 margarita's on the happy hour menu. Both had no issues and the drinks were good and strong as well. Unusual start with those tostada chips and the the bean dip and salsa, but once again these two free starters were top notch.    Minus a star for the close tables and seating. Really don't care about Little Johnny's day at school, but it is tight seating up front, so grab a table in back for privacy. The music guy was a nice change, but did not drown out the people right next to me."}
{"text":"Michael took care of us this evening and everything was fantastic!!! Food was incredible. He sold us on all the goodies-- calamari, goat cheese app- chipotle shrimp burritos! Mango salad! We ate so much and everything was DELICIOUS!   YUMMY and served with great attention to detail! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I can't tell you the number of times that I've wanted to partake in happy hour but the bar tables are all taken while the rest of the restaurant is nearly empty and the hostess looks at me with an awkward smile.  Annoying.      Such an occasion happened earlier this week and the hostess promptly grabbed the happy hour menu and seated us a table-table.  High points for that one.    Drinks are delicious and I highly recommend the cucumber jalapeno margarita.  They bring a neat little array of sauces and spices for the chips.  My vampire taco was delicious.    Great experience and I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"My hubby and I were looking for a good Mecican restaurant by our hotel the Westin. Sol definitely delivered! We ordered the corn appetizer, each had our own taco plates and sangria. everything was delicious. Our waiter  Rodrico was friendly, attentive and great. The atmosphere at Sol is inviting yet modern. We enjoyed the meal and service. I highly recommend this restaurant if you are looking for good fresh food without the high prices of deseo."}
{"text":"Hey everybody,veggie blogger here! Not sure when the definition of vegetarian meant load up on black beans but Sol practices it.  Ordered a grilled veg burrito. Sounded good on the menu since the burrito supposedly should have had onions, peppers, pico de gallo, sauce, and beans.   Dissecting my burrito I ended up with an overflow of black beans and onions on the side with nothing else in the middle. To add to that, I had more beans on the plate with some rice.  Overall the burrito was cooked right to my liking. The salsa that came with chips was flavourful and spicy. Black beans was cooked just that there was too much of it. I would have liked more veggies than beans.   The Don Julio margarita was excellent!! The rice on the side was tasty. Though most of the people on our group didn't enjoy their meal, I think it was good for a one time experience.   But I don't think it's a restaurant I would look forward to coming back for a second time. This place in the Scottsdale quarter was average."}
{"text":"SOL is the best Mexican restaurant in Scottsdale.. I  ask for Cassandra if you can. She is beautiful inside and out. The food represents the best of classic street food and modern cuisine. Highly recommend trying the jalapeño sauce."}
{"text":"Overall, I wasn't impressed, but it also wasn't totally awful. The ambiance was great, beautiful copper decor throughout. Our waiter was great. The complementary salsa was delicious, but the tostada style chips were a bit inconvenient and I didn't love the seasoning- kind of bitter chili powder. I got the chicken tacos with rice and beans on the side. I find the meal to be under-salted to my taste, but there was no salt on any of the tables. The flavors were bland in my meal."}
{"text":"I had dinner here two nights in a row, while I was in town from Dallas. The first night I tried the sweet potato tacos and mushroom tacos. Bot were excellent, not bland as you usually expect from veggie tacos. I had no need to pour any hot sauce on the tacos. The grilled corn was excellent as well. The second night I was joined by my coworkers, they ordered various tacos but I had the Cheese enchiladas. They were tasty!! You could taste the fresh cilantro in the sauce, not overly cheesy. The side of rice and black beans were good too. Everyone was full and raving about the food by the end of the meal."}
{"text":"Not bad, but the highlight of the meal was the chips and salsa.  I ordered the shrimp chile relleno and there were maybe three shrimp in the whole dish.  Our server was really attentive, but the food was just okay, and everything was pricey.  We had a nice time, but we probably won't eat here again."}
{"text":"We came for dinner on Saturday evening and were greeted warmly by the hostess and promptly seated. Our waitress was Amy who was very attentive, efficient and sweet. They bring chips, salsa, and bean dip to the table when you are seated. A Mexican restaurant must have great chips and salsa and SOL hits the mark completely. I ordered the grilled steak burrito with black beans and spicy slaw.  My wife ordered quesadillas with the sides and all of our food was excellent.  This perhaps may be the best Mexican food we have had in 5 years.   The food tasted fresh and the portions were huge. The manager introduced himself and he couldn't have been nicer, unless of course he bought a round of drinks.  LOL This is an upscale restaurant so the food isn't cheap but it's not overpriced either. This is my new favorite place in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Came around 7:00 pm on a Friday and were seated right away. I got the pork carnitas grilled burrito and it was delicious! Stuffed with so much meat which is great. I hate getting burritos that is mostly beans/rice/fillers instead of meat.  I didn't care too much for the black beans side, I wish there were another option of beans but it wasn't the worse thing. My husband got some fish tacos and he liked them although it wasn't as filling as my burrito. Awesome atmosphere, I love the decoration and feel of the restaurant.  Not super expensive, although I added like $1 to my burrito by getting it \"wet\" (sauce on top) and another $2 for some melted cheese. Worth it! Our server was very nice, not overbearing but came by often enough to fill drinks etc. Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Had great service and wonderful food.  Waiter made excellent recommendations.  We were not disappointed. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I came here with a group of friends and was highly disappointed. I'm not sure what everyone else was tasting, but this was NOT at all good food. Let alone to be called \"Mexican\" restaurant. Of course given the area, the food was overpriced for the taste and quality of it. The salsa was watered down and the chips looked like Tostada's instead of chips. I would rather go to Blanco Tacos and Tequilas with better food than to visit this place again. On a good note, the server was nice and also cute."}
{"text":"I wish there were two separate ratings, one for service and one for the food itself. Five star food and three star service. You might think that would average out to four stars but to me, that's why I go out to eat. To have someone take care of me because I cook at home most of the time. I had a fish taco with Gobernador sauce.  Amazing flavored. Their chips are good too... not greasy."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for a late lunch after a long day of travel in crowded airports with 5 billion rude people (ok...maybe only 3 billion) and we were CRANKY. Between the super-friendly manager, and our amazing server Rodrigo...we were smiling and laughing in no time. Then the food came.... two words... Taco Vampiro! This thing was a crazy good combination of flavors that defy true explanation. My husband ordered the Fish Tacos Zarandeado and would have you believe they were better than my Vampiro.....as if.  Extra tip: treat yourself to a shot of the Clase Azul Reposado tequila... very good!"}
{"text":"We had a great experience here. The guacamole was delicious and the chips and salsa also came to the table with hot tasty bean dip. Our server was great. Also had the ala carte fish taco which was really good but felt the price was a bit high. Maybe just not used to Scottsdale pricing. Family members thought it was a bit too dark inside. But it was quiet, comfortable and convenient from the Westin Hotel."}
{"text":"Have visited this restaurant 3 times now & all were good experiences.  I enjoy the skinny margarita with a spicy salt rim.  We ordered several items from Yelp reviews, all were very good.  Spicy Ceviche was excellent- but really spicy! We will go back I'm sure"}
{"text":"Great Mexican restaurant at Kierland Commons. Especially tasty was the special guacamole with goat cheese and the chili relleno. The service was both friendly and efficient. The short rib barbacoa was fork tender. The sides with the meals were traditional (rice send black beans) and nuevo (quinoa and slaw). The size of the plates were generous. I will definitely check out their location in Playa Vista upon returning to Los Angeles."}
{"text":"Went with friends to Taco Tuesday. When we arrived we were told there was a 20 min wait for either outside or insidde. The inside was totally empty. The hostess said there was a big party and the tables needed to be cleaned, it doesn't take 20 min to wipe down 6 tables. Once we sat down, it took at least 10 min for the server to acknowledge us. When we finally ordered the server was not very friendly. I wanted items on the Taco Tuesday menu and didn't know that carne asada tacos were different than carnitas, both are steak tacos. Also, didn't know that sweet corn is different than street corn. A good server would ask if someone was ordering off the Taco Tuesday menu if the rest of the table is. He did not check back with us once the food was delivered. We had to hunt down the server to get our check and when we told the server that we wanted to split the check she automatically divided it 3 ways, never asking how it was to be split.  I have come here a few times for work and had no issues. Coming here on a personal visit, it sucked."}
{"text":"This place was amazing!! Our waiter Antendo (sorry, excuse my horrid spelling) was just the best! He was very professional and knew the whole menu. He treated us very kindly and was very prompt on filling our waters and getting the food out quickly. He was so sweet! He even made my friend and me cute drinks and took pictures of us. Not to mention the food was amazing! I ordered a quesadilia and it was soo good. I looked too good to eat, but trust me it was even better to eat! I will be coming back soon, and i suggest it to everyone. :) great great food and service. Oh yeah, their cheese is also super good. #ali"}
{"text":"Wasn't overly impressed with the food at Sol Mexican Cocina. Went for Happy hour. Ordered a margarita and chicken tortilla soup. Although the soup was flavorful, is was small and not very filling. The atmosphere is cool, indoor/outdoor seating. Pretty busy for a Wed. 3/5 stars"}
{"text":"Poor service, sub par food, decent cocktails. There is definitely some room for improvement."}
{"text":"This review is for Happy Hour only. The drinks were good. The food was OK.  Nice place."}
{"text":"Food was below average and the restaurant seems dark and dirty. Service also below average. Wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"The food and service at Sol are excellent!  I'd like to thank Sharon who was extremely helpful to me when coordinating a business dinner for 20 people from my company's management team in October.  We enjoyed the atmosphere of the back room, attentive service, and variety of great food that left everyone full at the end of dinner."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere ,service staff all professional and informational. The music by solo guitar player was awesome! The food was superb. I tried so many new things..all terrific! We will be coming back for sure !"}
{"text":"We had lunch at SOL and were pleasantly surprised. Our server recommended the special tacos ordered individually. In particular the vampiro. He was right. It was tasty and unique. The meat was tender and the toppings were abundant without being over powering. Our children ordered off the kids menu and were happy with their chicken and cheese tacos and red rice. As a starter you get complimentary tortilla chips and a couple of dips. One dip in particular was quite tasty but garlicky. Overall  a tasty meal and decent service."}
{"text":"My favorite place for vegetarian tacos. The Clase Azul margarita is way better and about the same price and quantity as two house margaritas. I love the black bean dip."}
{"text":"While the food is good,  the service here leaves  a lot to be desired.  Took 10+ minutes to get a drink (multiple times), nobody cleaned our table,  and we didn't have anyone come by to see if we needed anything. Too bad because could be a good place."}
{"text":"The food was amazing but wasn't your traditional Mexican food. They added a lighter twist. The atmosphere was great and service was quick. A must go to in Scottsdale, Arizona! Sadly no beer on draft."}
{"text":"This place has great food!  They start with a healthy version of chips and salsa. Baked tortillas and warm puréed black beans and salsa. Delic!!   I've dined here several times, and each time the food and the service have been excellent.   Super nice ambiance, and they have a great Happy Hour!!"}
{"text":"Very nice ambiance. They sometimes have live music. Love their salsa and bean dip. Guacamole is amazing . They have a nice happy hour and I also recommend the brunch. Their frozen mango margarita used to be really good but last time I tried  it, i couldn't taste the mango. Love the outside patio and very friendly staff."}
{"text":"I was actually quite impressed with this place. My sister and I stopped in for a quick lunch. We wanted something light and delicious. We were NOT disappointed. We had the seaBass ceviche appetizer. There could have been a bit for fish, but the flavor was delish! Reminds me of my favorite ceviche from Costa Rica. Then, we ordered,  FISH TACO 'GOBERNADOR' wild-caught fish, pan-roasted with lemon & garlic, on a taco dorado with cheese, salsa gobernador, avocado, onion & cilantro, pico & lettuce.  It was light and oh so yummy. The portions are small, but the food was great!"}
{"text":"Great Easter brunch!  Ask for rolled quesadilla w huevos & carnitas :-)  Don Julio margarita martini style in a heavily salted glass.  Ah, life is good :-)  First time here I thought eh, 2 at best.  Then the Yelp party made me give it another shot.  It just keeps getting better, seriously.  Sol is in 4+ territory now!  Especially w the terrific live music  Taco Tuesday!  So fun.  The 3-piece band is terrific, I came for the food & drinks but am staying for the music!!  Place has become really quite good. And they have what I think is the best happy hour menu and drinks in the neighborhood.  Greg makes a great Don Julio skinny margarita!  Also love the carnitas tacos and shrimp cocktail (actually more of a ceviche)  Guitarist tonight playing alt rock tunes.  I'm really digging it!  This place is really growing on me. The drinks are quite solid, the food is lovely. Happy hour has some great deals and the chips and black bean dip with pumpkin seeds is incredibly addictive"}
{"text":"Had a great time here last night for dinner. My favorite was the Shrimp Dorado taco. The taco was amazing. Also enjoyed my Blackberry Ginger Margarette perfect balance of ginger and fruit. The Sol guacamole is also a must have. Love the atmosphere and the decor. My only complaint was my husband's beans and rice were cold. They need to do a better job making sure these items are kept fresh. Other than that, it's a perfect place for a date night if you want a light meal."}
{"text":"We enjoyed everything we ate!  We had a party of 8 adults with 4 children.  \"Spicy\" is a little warmer than I'm use to and I can handle a little heat - I took cooling sips of my husband's margarita and all was well!  Nice restaurant - good food - excellent service."}
{"text":"I love their happy hour! Get the corralejo skinny margarita  (more booze same cost, hey I'm on a budget! And I want a good buzz) and the sol guacamole is to die for. Marlena is the coolest bartender. She really makes your experience fun and is super thoughtful. Sometimes I feel like bartenders are just in a bad mood, don't want to be there, not in this case! She is on her A game!   Super easy to park and just walk there. Scottsdale quarter doesn't charge for parking and it's easier than fighting for a spot at Kierland.   This was my second visit so I'm glad both times impressed me! I will be back next time I'm on vacation!"}
{"text":"We were seated right away and the service was REALLY SLOW.  It took over 15 mins to get our drinks and about 1 hour for tacos and a quesadilla... Our drinks were never refilled and the waiter never came by once to ask how we were doing how the food tasted... My steak was still mooing! Gross! I ended up eating my kids quesadilla with chips and salsa."}
{"text":"We love this place. The corn was so delicious!  We also liked the tostada style chips they serve with their yummy salsa.  We went for an early Saturday night dinner, as this restaurant tends to get busy later.  I had a shrimp taco that was very good."}
{"text":"My first time here I had a blended Margarita and a taco via happy hour, I came back two days later and had the same thing. Great happy hour, great service, love it here."}
{"text":"Gr8 place for Mexican . Service was good. Drinks were good. Had a couple of the tacos. Very spicy which was gr8 and very filling . Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Appetizers and drinks were good. Entrees were awful, service didn't seem interested in helping us. Actually sent an entree back, it was that awful. Place is cute and good ambiance, but all that stops There. Not much good to say about the place other than its cute and in a good location."}
{"text":"This has become our new favorite restaurant! The first time we came here we had the best tacos ever! Make sure you try the Kobe Steak Taco!! We have been here several times with different waiters, they have all been good with service. We usually ask for Garrett, we think he is newer, he is really polite and never lets my drink run low. I don't know how, but he remembered both my wife and I by name! The chips here are different, but very good!! I wish I had more of a chance at the bean dip, but my wife believes it is her personal dish every time... Garrett recommended the calamari to me, I don't know how they make it, but it is to die for and now we get it every time!! EAT HERE, YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere, food is yummy, great quality, best service and staff, Arnoldo was our server and made our dining experience so enjoyable, highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Olé! Not that I need a reason to go out for margaritas and tacos... but having Taco Tuesday as an excuse definitely helps! Aside from the other great places in the valley that have the amazing (and very dangerous) frozen margaritas, Sol has lip-smackingly delicious margaritas!   The moment you walk in and sit, one of the delightful staff members brings you a basket of fresh-out-of-the-fryer house-made tortilla chips with a delicious bean dip and mild salsa (so yum!) And on Taco Tuesday, the special is -- can you guess? TACOS!!! There are a handful of the tacos that are a \"steal\" on the special menu, and of course, the full menu is always an option if the special deals don't appeal to your tastebuds.   On this particular visit, my best friend and I needed to unwind, relax, and have some girl talk over tacos and margaritas. We both ordered a house margarita with no agave or simple syrup -- yes, we like our margaritas tart -- and we munched on the warm tortilla chips and the dips.   We decided we should get some tacos... because, Taco Tuesday... so I got two grilled chicken tacos and my best friend got two carne asada tacos. Oh.Em.Gee. These tacos are so good!!! Full of flavor, and they don't skimp on the meat! They also give you this amazing hot sauce that is sure to kick up the heat on the tacos a notch or two... or ten. Proceed with caution if you don't like spicy. I do, however, so I loaded up on the hot sauce and woo, it was tasty. (I may have chugged my margarita and water thereafter, but it was a good hurt. haha)  What I love about Sol is that you get good food at a great price, and the atmosphere is wonderful. The staff is superb, attentive, and kind as well. This wasn't my first time going to Sol, and it most certainly won't be my last!"}
{"text":"I need to upgrade my review based on my constant return to their happy hour.  They have a very good one.  My hubby and I enjoy having an impromptu date sometimes in the middle of the week and we meet here for HH.  I love the Coctel de Camaron, it is exactly the way I love my shrimp ceviche.  Their skinny Margaritas are delicious, too, and since they are supposed to be skinny I guess you can afford two.  haha.  The other great idea they have now is their Tuesdays Tacos and Tequilas.  Last Tuesday it was a lot of fun.  They had live music and specials on tacos and margaritas.  I am glad I had signed up for their e-mail updates, that is how I learned about this new event."}
{"text":"The BEST calamari! The Con Queso is also excellent.  Best Friday night happy hour in north Scottsdale"}
{"text":"Great tacos. Beef was delicious and tender. Shrimp taco was awesome as well. Hubby had the burrito and he really enjoyed it.Yummy house margarita. Salsa could use some work. Fun trendy atmosphere."}
{"text":"The tacos had good flavor but the corn tortilla fell apart pretty quickly and made it a bit hard to eat. We did enjoy the live music and intimate setting. We will return to try something else on the menu!"}
{"text":"Best Tacos Ever!!! Point! Blank! Period!!!  and Stephanie our bartender/server went above and beyond in every way!!!! We are going to make this an annual tradition!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill. I recently took an out of town visitor here and I was so disappointed. I have always loved their food and the margaritas there. We ordered margaritas this time and we got the upgraded tequila. $18 and they were so sweet we couldn't drink them, I swear there was not a bit of tequila in them. The food was still pretty good, that's why I gave them 3 stars. Last year I would have given them 5, but with expensive bad drinks, it ruined the experience. I don't mind paying for good tequila, but then give it to me. Armando was our waiter, he has served us there several times, he is so nice."}
{"text":"This place surprised me! Didn't know what to expect when we sat down but was pleasantly surprised. The bean dip served with the complimentary chips and salsa was awesome!! I've never had anything like it. I got the burrito bowl and loved how they didn't skimp on meat. Everyone else liked there food as well!"}
{"text":"The server was very nice.  I ordered a $10 steak taco.  When it arrived I looked for a magnifying glass to find it on my plate.  I'm not a big eater but that was under sized and over priced.  A bad menu idea."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the ambience and music here. The food is fabulous and so are the drinks. It's dark and cave like but it also has a nice flare to the outdoor bar. The chorizo add chicken with a flour tortilla is the way to go. The guacamole is amazing as well. To top it off there drinks are delicious as well. Get a group of friends and come to sol. I'm yet to meet someone who doesn't love the place."}
{"text":"Enjoyed an amazing lunch of drinks and apps! Service was great! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite place to eat in North Scottsdale. I stay up at night laying in bed craving the guacamole, my taste buds have forever changed because of it. Get an organic margarita, best and most flavorful thing at Sol besides those sweet sweet sweeeeet potato tacos that you won't be able to stop ordering because they are so delicious. Sol will change your life, forever."}
{"text":"I work in The Quarter and all 3 times I've been to Sol service has been horrible! Last night was the last night I will go. It took my friend 45 minutes to get her drink, the manager was busy helping the bartender, running plates of food that had been waiting more than 10 minutes to be served and it was not even that busy. The food is good, I will miss that but it does not make up for the lack of customer satisfaction."}
{"text":"I went in to ask for the general manager's contact information and name but instead was sworn at and threatened to leave by a low end manager, Eric Gross.   I used to love this restaurant, but if you have any issues, the manager (Eric Gross) will just swear at you and tell you that you're wrong. So just a heads up, if you value customer experience and service, don't go to Sol. The manager wouldn't let me even speak and kept cutting me off and didn't even want to hear me or listen to me. I simply wanted an email or a phone number for his boss because of the way he treated my parents. And instead he got defensive and started swearing at me inside the restaurant. When I asked for the information again and tried to speak he threatened me with foul language to GTFO. I truly feel for others who work in customer service like myself, so I try to avoid anything that may cause issues but what Eric did was uncalled for. Their food is not good enough to get treated the way myself and my parents were just treated. Truly the worst experience I've ever had and I was there for only two minutes."}
{"text":"Always have a lot of fun here. Wife is obsessed with their guacamole and I'm obsessed with their coronaritas! The food portion sizes are mainly on the smaller side for the price but there are a few that are bigger. Their carnitas is top notch so I usually always get it"}
{"text":"I used to love this place when it was Park Central, but now it is no bueno. It's a huge happy hour hot spot for cool people, but the food is mediocre at best. For example- we ordered chicken and steak tacos on happy hour and all we got were tortillas with meat and cilantro. Really? Gordon bierch serves better tacos than this place. Overpriced and overhyped in my opinion."}
{"text":"When you walk into a \"Mexican\" restaurant and ask the waiter, \" what do you have that is spicy?\" and he replies with, \"well, we don't really have much spicy food\" you're in trouble."}
{"text":"Service was great! The food was o.k., not a big fan of yellow corn tortillas, flavor is overpowering.  Tacos didn't have a lot of flavor.  Margaritas were good."}
{"text":"We came here for a business lunch and left feeling as if we had just enjoyed something special.   As our server Carlos bought us our menu and water glasses, I had already figured out what I was going to order.  I had been reading the Yelp reviews about their delicious Ceviche for $14.00. What caught my eye was the small cuts, almost diced portions of fish.  In some restaurants, it is almost like they are trying to overwhelm you with the size of the cuts.  Not here!  And yes, it was delicious!  Carlos asked how much spice I wanted before he mixed all the ingredients.  First class.  Also while we were checking in on Yelp, we found that there was $5.00 Off one Don Julio Blanco margarita. Thank you Yelp! They were also willing to substitute the offer for their Sangria. Nice!  My friend Richard S had the equally good breaded Coconut Calamari for $12.50. It was excellent!    We split our bill and our lunch came to very reasonable $19.63, including taxes and tip. Next up will be coming here for their Happy Hour and Taco Tuesdays."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite Mexican food. Everything is great there but I enjoy their taco gobernador which is the premium fish taco and buffalada, a mixture of beef, pork, and chicken. It's on the expensive side but the quality, taste, and service are worth it."}
{"text":"Everything was amazing!  The black bean dip and grilled corn are delicious!  As was the seafood enchiladas, carne asada tacos, and fish tacos.  Desserts were divine, and the service was top notch.  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Made a reservation through Yelp for a Friday evening and I'm so glad I did. Fantastic food and service!! This has quickly become my new favorite Mexican restaurant. So delicious. You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"This is yet another over hyped and over priced Scottsdale eatery.   Went in today around 4pm with no reservations, we were seated right away and luckily by the kitchen. I say luckily because the line manger who our primary server.  Either we came during a shift change or there was serious confusion about who our server because he/she was hard to track and changed during our early dinner. No introduction, just a different person. Thank goodness being by the front, we were able to request assistance from the hostess stand as well.   Trust me, we were not needy ... Just wanted some water and a spoon.    The food was mediocre; I have had more flavorful food through a mom and pop drive thru.   I will drive 10 miles for good Mexican cuisine and am definitely going avoid coming to SOL if I am in need of a Salsa and taco fix.  I am all for combining flavors and creating delicious fusion cuisine; however, at these prices keep the water glasses filled, check in with your table and when bussing ... Keep the crumbs off your guests' laps."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food I ever had.  Great cocktail drinks Chips and guac and salsa Everything was awesome"}
{"text":"Went there on a Friday night at 7. They were out of chips for the rest of the night. First margarita was goof the second one had no tequila in it.  Guacamole was tasteless except for the lemon or lime taste. Street taco were ok.  Couple next to us at the bar said they weren't come back. We won't either."}
{"text":"Great place for tacos and margaritas. Our server Armando was great. He explained what we needs and keep our drinks full. Had carnitas tacos and grill street corn. With margaritas to wash them down. Good little lunch. Hit the spot."}
{"text":"My wife and I the other day went to Sol and it was the best! Food, drinks, and service were all on point and our server Amanda was excellent! Very knowledgeable and upbeat! We had to try the different variations of street tacos because, let's be real, if you're a Mexican restaurant and you can't make delicious street tacos then you may not be in business very long. Our entire meal to say the least was 5 star and we will definitely be back to try some of the other menu items they have to offer!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and good patio.  Open late which is a plus in North Scottsdale.  The tortilla soup was perfect,  broth base and full of flavor. If you do not like raw onions I suggest you ask for them on the side or a lighter amount added. Carne Asada tacos were good too. Only reason I gave 4 stars is because I lived in Texas for a while so nothing lives up to TexMex! #biased"}
{"text":"Food was tolerable, and tasteless.  The chips were actually tostadas that were extremely hard (almost stale) when eating. The entrees we ordered were bland.  The rice and beans had no flavor at all.  Maybe that is Baja style of food, but couldn't find the flavor anywhere. The service was great and the ambiance was wonderful, but I don't think we'll be going to this place again."}
{"text":"Food was very tasty, the service was excellent but the margaritas were marginal.  Great atmosphere and people and I'd definitely recommend."}
{"text":"We've had excellent food in the past but mixed opinions from this party of 4. A good restaurant should have consistently good good. But it was unanimous that our waiter, Brandon, was the worst any of us have had in years."}
{"text":"Not from the area, but checked yelp and tried it. Unbelievably good. Carnitas tacos were incredible. Everything was great. Next time in Scottsdale, I will come here."}
{"text":"Delicious! Excellent service by Lady, she was awesome! The frozen mango chili margarita was so good! One of the best, if not the best margarita I've ever had. They serve a delicious bean dish and salsa with homemade chips before your meal. The table side elote was good, but needed some seasoning. We had the Grilled Estofado and it was delicious as well. The kitchen lost our order but they brought us complimentary guacamole while we waited. The drinks were so delicious and the environment so lovely we didn't mind."}
{"text":"Baja style Mexican. It was ok. Awesome staff and fabulous drinks but the food was just ok."}
{"text":"First of all, the hostess was rude and total B word.   We got there at about 630/7pm ish and there were a few other ppl there waiting for tables, so we went up to the hostess and asked for a table for 2. She said it'll be 20-25 minutes and I replied.. \"that's fine.\" She says \"name number\" after we gave her a name and a number she says \"text you when it's ready\" ... from the time I initially asking for a table for 2 to her telling us it'll text us when its ready.. not once did she smile or look up. RUDE!   So we walked over to the bar and found 2 seats, we decided to get a drink there and wait a few mins for the table.. 10/15 mins rolls by so we just decide to eat at the bar instead. But we never did get a text.. so I suppose the table was never ready.. or the hostess that never paid 1 bit of attention to the customers typed in the wrong number.   Complimentary slightly seasoned chips and salsa and a black bean dip. Which was very good.   We order a taco plate, I got grilled chicken street tacos. They were pretty good. Very basic street tacos w/ a choice of 2 sides, quinoa salad, black beans, spicy slaw and rice. I got quinoa salad and black beans, both of which were pretty good. The plate came w/ 3 tacos, its actually more food that it looked.   Remember to as for the hot sauce.. it has a kick to it but pretty tasty!   They have happy hour from 3-6pm, just fyi."}
{"text":"I'd been here before and don't remember regretting it but on this visit the food and drinks were LAME.   Pineapple Serrano Maragrita lacked any detectable taste of pineapple and was just as green as a house margarita. There was virtually no \"bite.\" Really?   Then the Big Chop salad was carnitas had the most bland taste, seemingly under-cooked pork, and fatty carnitas (had to spit one piece out in the napkin-never a good thing). Do they test these meals for great flavor and taste? Apparently not.   Waitress was wonderful and gets an A+ for service recovery, offering me new drink and entree in a jiffy. Nonetheless, I doubt I'll be back.  Sad, since it's an ideal location at a great mall.  Try harder Sol, try harder."}
{"text":"Pretty good place to grab a quick lunch in Scottsdale Quarter.  The atmosphere was cool and relaxing, the service was nice and the food was good and super quick.  The veggie tacos were really good and the chips and salsa weren't bad either.  Hopefully this place will last longer than the previous restaurant."}
{"text":"Ambiance was fantastic, even better was the Horchata Margarita!  However, I could not eat the food as it was so salty.  Why don't restaurants realize us baby boomers are a good portion of the people going out to dinner and we all try to keep our blood pressure down?  Carnitas Street Tacos were tasteless and the tortillas were dripping with steam table juice...  Never again!  Wait staff was excellent..."}
{"text":"Over priced and flavorless. The staff was nice enough but they seemed to forget about us. The guacamole was good but the chips were made from cheap tortillas. All the tortillas were cheap even though they show then being made on the menu. The food completely lacked flavor and nothing was salted. Will not return."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times now, and every time it's been great.  It is the closest I've come to finding the pseudo-Mexican that I've enjoyed in other cities.  The fried fish tacos were outstanding.  Amazing flavor and the ingredients all balanced each other out.  The waitstaff is really friendly and knowledgeable.  I think the restaurant inside is a little dark, a little loud, and poorly laid out.  All the tables in the front are all bar height, so if that's not your thing eat in the back or outside.  The special guacamole with mango and goat cheese was fair.  I'd stick to the regular."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants.    You should definitely try the various versions of their Guacamole and their Ceviche.  It is so hard to find a good ceviche besides going down to Costa Rica and they do it well here.  Their specialty tacos are a great option if you want to try various flavors, but the other entrees they have are great as well.    This has a great location in Scottsdale Quarters and has outdoor dining as well.  If you are looking for some great food and margaritas, I would head over to check it out.  At night this place is typically crowded, but it is very easy to find a table during the day."}
{"text":"On recommendation from hotel staff, we stopped in for for a light lunch and drinks.  Great decor and ambience.  Extremely friendly and professional service.  Amazing margaritas -- some of the best I've ever had.  Unique \"chips and salsa\", fantastic tacos.  I particularly enjoyed the pork carnitas and mushroom/polbano/corn tacos.  Yelpers get a special deal too when you check in."}
{"text":"What a find!! Sol, you make me so happy. Came here on a Sunday on a whim for lunch, and much to my surprise they had brunch from 10am - 3pm. I am a sucker for huevos rancheros, and the claim on the menu, \"the best huevos in town\" had me drooling.   But, on this particular day I couldn't help ordering the Crab & Shrimp Cakes \"Benedicto\". Two HUGE crisp-fried crab & shrimp cakes topped with poached eggs & chipotle-orange hollandaise sauce, double-smoked bacon, avocado & refried black beans. RIDICULOUSLY good!! Kids (ages 6 and 9) ordered bean & cheese burritos. Everything was fantastic.   Our waitress was terrific, and really allowed the kids to pick exactly what they wanted and even offered to let them \"assemble\" them. Very cute and appreciated. Service was fast, efficient, and friendly.  Washed it down with a glass of sparkling wine. Live music in the background. Yes, I best believe this was the best unexpected 2pm Sunday brunch I've ever had!! I could definitely make this a habit.  I cannot wait to head back for some happy hours and the huevos!! Great addition to one of my favorite spots around - Scottsdale Quarter. Man, I love this town."}
{"text":"Great staff! FAB food! LOVE that you can ala carte the tacos and add or take away from what you need. Beans..yep. Beans .. Nope. Margaritas .. Icy.. top shelf .. Premium.. strong! Who's driving again??? Love the way that the flat shell is brought instead of greasy, carb laden chips all taken from some plastic bag and greased down and tossed before you with some jarred salsa. I love this place. It brings class to the cocina. I always get the Mezcal chicken tacos. Eat one. Bring the rest home for the next day. Splurge on the beans and flat shell and salsa. Tres bien!"}
{"text":"Short wait time. Server was attentive and helpful. Had the guacamole and the sweet potato/black bean tacos, but were delicious!!"}
{"text":"Great patio, good happy hour, love the carnitas tacos.  Good drink selection... interesting options... had some jalenpeno margarita of some sorts...  Nice upscale place with a very friendly comfortable atmosphere.  Located in Scottsdale quarter just east of Brio... if you turn in the parking garage off Greenway parkway it is just to the left of the parking garage entrance."}
{"text":"This is my second time at a Sol restaurant and I have had a great experience both times. The service has been stellar and the food was excellent! Alberto made our experience memorable. He knew the menu well, was very pleasant and talkative, making us want to come back! He also gave great recommendations.   We're vegetarian, which they had a full menu to accommodate. We tried all 4 veggie tacos, the squash and sweet potato being our favorite! The sweet corn side is fresh and light!   We highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Made a reservation for anniversary...both the times they accommodated a larger party and moved our reservation to a table on a side - bad table!!! Really stupid and thoughtless reservation staff. Good food- bad waitresses"}
{"text":"My husband and I were vacationing in Scottsdale for a week and had not had any food that blew us away. We were looking for some really good food to eat on our last night and decided to try Sol. This was the best decision!   First let me say that our server, Marlena, was amazing. Very personable, attentive, fun, and full of life. She gave us great drink and food selections and made us feel so welcomed. She was one of the highlights of our visit in Scottsdale.   Now to the food and drinks which was all so incredible! I had a blackberry ginger margarita which was so flavorful and strong without being overwhelming. My husband had the $5 margarita which was a special through the Yelp app and he also enjoyed his. For an appetizer we had the corn which was very similar to Mexican street corn. The flavors were good and my husband really liked it. I think it could have used more cheese and spice but it was still good. For our entrees we had the Carne asada tacos with rice and beans and the shrimp quesadillas with spicy slaw and rice. The tacos were very good but the shrimp quesadillas were out of this world. We could have eaten those all night. The flavor combinations were so unique. The rice was your typical rice, the slaw was very lackluster, but the beans were pretty good.   If you're in the area definitely give this place a try. And if you get Marlena be sure to leave her a good tip because she's amazing."}
{"text":"Sol has a great selection of authentic Mexican dishes that aren't just your average taco.   I was adventurous and got the grilled quail, a tad over grilled, I tasted a bit more char than bird, but overall very succulent. They also make their own monster tortilla chips at Sol...among things that look better than they taste, but they deserve an E for effort."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience at happy hour. Armando our server was excellent. Very attentive knowledgeable and fun. Food was delicious. Homemade tortilla chips. Ceviche. Grilled chicken street tacos. Their margaritas were good too. We will be back. Their music and ambience was very fun."}
{"text":"The food is pretty reliable - but the service was terrible!   Not sure when I'll go back...."}
{"text":"It took me some time to get here after their open, but since I went a month ago, I've been back four more times - taking different people with me each time to experience their great food! The menu is full of unique food combos and everything I've had has been great, so I just want to keep making my way through it! The patio is right on Greenway, but it's still a nice place to enjoy one of their many margaritas! The staff is friendly and keeps their cool when it gets crowded on the weekend nights, but unfortunately was slow the last time I was in on a pretty dead Thursday...guess they're not a fan of patrons just drinking a few beers and watching a game."}
{"text":"Food is awesome, Love the Sparkiling Pomegranite!! Will be back just for that. Also the manager stooped by our table and said hello, Nice touch Danielle. Thank You for the outstanding experience. We Will be Back"}
{"text":"One of my favorite upscale Mexican food restaurants in Scottsdale for sure! Their rustic decor makes for a romantic and intimate setting, and their Jalapeño Cucumber Margarita is the best I've ever had! We tried some if the Warmed Goat Cheese, with roasted peanuts, the Coconut Calamari (best calamari steak ever) and their Grilled Sweet Corn, all of which were outstanding! They also bring out a black been puree mixed in with roasted tomatoes that's very tasty. I also tried a few of their tacos, the Filet & Shrimp El Jefe Taco (my least favorite tbh, didn't taste like filet that's for certain), the Short Rib on Blue Corn Tortilla Taco (definitely my favorite) and their Canarditas Duck Taco (a deep-fried duck leg confit on a tortilla, build-your-own style) that was different. We were do full and happy after, which is the best and the worst feeling ever haha we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Visited SOL while on a business trip in Scottsdale with my team and we loved the unique flavors and vegetarian options that were available. The decor was very cool and provided a nice, relaxed atmosphere to wind down from a long day. The food was excellent - I had both the shrimp taco and the short rib taco, and they were amazing. Would love to come back and try more of their selections!"}
{"text":"Excellent Food. My wife and I had the Kobe skirt steak, Shrimp Tacos and for an appetizer Guacamole Sol. Must admit I enjoyed everything. Our waitress Amy was simply phenomenal. She is very friendly and made great recommendations. If you visit Scottsdale you must try this place out."}
{"text":"Nothing special. Bland and just ok. Our party of 7 ordered different items from the menu and we were not impressed at all. I was expecting something better from a $15 burrito or tacos.  I will not go back. 2 stars for the location!"}
{"text":"Came here for a work event in the back room but enjoyed the margaritas - had a regular one as well as a cucumber jalapeño which was very tasty. I also had a few of their street tacos (a chicken, pork and steak) which were good but nothing really to write home about.  Although I don't live in the area, the place this is located in seemed pretty cool and the restaurant had a cool vibe to it as well. If I were to come back I'd probably try it out again in the regular restaurant."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and I am never too impressed.  Scottsdale prices, and odd presentation detract from my overall experience.  The tortilla chips here are whole tostada rounds, meaning you need to break them yourself, they are also quite thick.  The guacamole has a bit too much lime for my taste and not enough spice.  The tacos with veggies could have used a bit more filling."}
{"text":"Love this place...they hit  home run here...great atmosphere, happy hour mmrnu is over the top, margaritas are made perfect and the crevice on the main menu is a real treat..."}
{"text":"The food is very unique. And tasty . Tacos are great but i live the calamari very fresh"}
{"text":"I've been eating at this place every week for the past couple years since I meet with my networking group here. I'm always impressed with the servers; they are always on the ball and rarely mess up orders. The bathrooms are always clean and tidy too.  The food overall I enjoy. One of my favorites is the Carnitas Taco's. The flavor of the pork is very good with just a little spice... I ditch the corn taco shells and instead pour the meat over some rice and beans (yum!). The salsa is mild-medium so pretty much appeals to all tastes. Really the only menu item I've had that I think needs work is the tortas, specifically the bread they are served on... it's just too much bread for the amount of food inside the sandwich. Not to mention it's tough for the average mouth to even get the entire sandwich into it. I still order them from time to time but I end up making them an open faced sandwich and toss 1/2 the bread. They have an excellent patio to dine on year round too and it can accommodate a lot of people. They have a bar area out there, table and chair setups and even some cool couch configurations for larger groups."}
{"text":"1 star for ambiance.   Service was terrible. Barely saw the waiter.   Waiter also stated all food was made from scratch, but when we tried to modify one of the dishes, he tells us the food was pre-made earlier in the day.   Ordered the chicken burrito, which was 90% beans.   The \"wet\" burritos were barely covered in sauce and the sauce was dried onto it."}
{"text":"I visited SOL on a recent trip to Scottsdale.  Wow! Such a pleasant surprise to have wandered upon SOL after seeing a movie at iPic Theaters. Despite it being 'off-season', SOL was busy on a Monday evening which was a great sign.  Our waiter, Rodrigo, was fantastic...very attentive, friendly, knowledgeable about the menu, and was more than willing to give us his (honest) thoughts on the dishes we were considering.  The (free) seasoned corn tortillas, instead of your typical tortilla chips, were unique and so delicious.  Our party had the butternut squash taco, sweet corn, carnitas street tacos, and the carnitas platillo with sides of black beans, spicy coleslaw and rice. Absolutely NO complaints, every dish was fresh, hot, and the flavor was on point.  My aunt, who lives in Scottsdale, said the butternut squash taco was the best taco she has ever had!  Even though I was full, I managed to clean my carnitas platillo, too good to leave anything behind.  The ambiance is great and we being able to have a conversation without having to compete with loud music and/or other customers.  You won't regret your visit to SOL so go now!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I recently went to SOL and were blown away by their happy hour. We discovered SOL using the Whistl app for iPhone. It's great if you are a foodie like my girlfriend and I!   We shared the naked guacamole ($6) and the Baja Shrimp Cocktel ($7) and I had the SOL House Margarita ($5). It was a great lunch for the both of us. The guacamole was very fresh and had a great consistency. By far we like the Baja Shrimp Cocktel the most. It was very citrusy and the shrimp was delicious. In fact, it was so delicious, I was debating whether to just start drinking it from the glass before more chips came! It also tasted like it would make a great bloody mary mix, if you're into that sort of thing.   We would both also recommend the Pork Carnitas Street Tacos (2 for $4.50) and the Blanco Tequila Flight ($7.50) if you are a tequila enthusiast!   Overall we had an excellent experience, the service was also terrific. Thanks Whistl for letting us know about these great deals!"}
{"text":"Great place and Drew provided outstanding service!  Atmosphere and good food...what more do you need?"}
{"text":"Was in town for a bachelorette weekend and a group of us girls decided to come to SOL. First of all, the restaurant was beautiful!  We started with the grilled sweet corn, naked guacamole, and chorizo con queso. All were so delicious.  For dinner, we had the Wildfish Esquites, Ribeye, but our favorite was the Short Rib. It was so tender and flavorful. We ended with the dark chocolate bread  pudding and it was mouth wateringly good!  Such a wonderful experience. Service was friendly and attentive. Our margaritas were fresh and on point. Even the manger Ron came over to check on us and was so welcoming. Thank you team SOL for the wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"Horrible.. The food was NOTHING to get excited about. The steak and shrimp lacked seasoning. The Pico de gallo was chopped tomato and onion.. No flavor.. The street corn is better from a vendor on the streets of Los Angeles. They said the food is based on Mexican in Baja. Baja would be ashamed!!"}
{"text":"Very Nice Place, exceptionally good Margarita's & Food!!!"}
{"text":"We tried Sol Concina about a week ago on a Saturday night. The disinterested hostess sat us right in the doorway to the patio under a vent that felt like an industrial fan blowing on us. No big deal. I just asked if we could be moved to a much more comfortable table she walked us right past in the first place.   We ordered. Then waited. And waited. About 45 minutes later we caught the waitress and asked about our food. I guess they lost the ticket. They got our food to us pretty quick at that point.   Two bright spots. The manager came over to our table and he handled things well. Picked up desert and also took some money off our bill. The food was also decent.   Those two bright spots convinced us to go back for lunch today. We never made it past the rude hostess. I can deal with disinterested but she was awful. A family came in behind us and she was just as short with them. The strange thing was that the same manager was only 10 feet away and didn't seem to notice a thing. We couldn't have felt less welcome so we left.   Amazing how much damage a 'hostess' can do. The manager seems good at customer service but maybe not so good at managing staff."}
{"text":"Sol keep doing what you do and you will have a life long customer all the servers are friendly. I could drink enough of the house margaritas to kill my liver and still have a smile on. Honestly sometimes the fiancé and I just come up for chips & salsa margaritas. Also the chicken quesidilla is the bomb diggity. They also have really good bfast menu."}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere of the restaurant but not to keen on the menu. I think the calamari is my favorite dish."}
{"text":"The food was amazing and the service was great. I had the lobster and shrimp tacos and the grilled sweet corn with the strawberry, Serrano guacamole. They have an impressive selection of tequila and great variety of margaritas. The only thing I will say is that the food did take some time to get to us ( like 35 minutes) but if you've ever gone to brand new restaurants, teamwork and timing is shortly acquired after opening week. I highly recommend this this place if you want good baja Mexican food and great service."}
{"text":"No complaints, I would not call it amazing but for being in this part of Scottsdale, this joint is actually surprisingly good and chill. Okay it's not hardcore true Mexico but it's fair, clean and tasty, they have a very good tequila selection and legit dishes.. is a safe bet for decent value. All good."}
{"text":"Great food. I had the fish ceviche fresh and delicious. Awesome costumer service is always a plus. I'll be back soon to try out other items that caught my interest."}
{"text":"If I base my review on just the tacos at their price point two stars is accurate.  Their were lots of things I did like about SOL Mexican Cocina. They present you with above average salsas and and spiced toastadas. The margaritas were good and strong but maybe pricey.  ($10.50 and $13.75) I loved the warmed goat cheese with salted peanuts and that sweet hot chipotle syrup it was like whipped cream cheese but tastier and all that sweet salty and spicy went really well together. It is worth coming here just for the goat cheese. The grilled corn was good! Not the best I've ever had but GOOD!  They are accommodating to vegans and vegetarians. Service is above average as our server Amanda was very knowledgeable and informative and seemed well trained.  Now the tacos.  The tacos are Baja style street tacos. They are very small tacos.  My husband had the sampler plate and I ordered two ala carte tacos so together we tried five kinds.  We tried chicken, beef, pork, fish and vegetable. For the most part the tacos were just meh but the stand outs were the pork and fish tacos. We spent $30.25 on 8 MINI TINY tacos. The chicken was the most undesirable but passable. The chicken was sort of dry and not so tasty. The beef one could have been more flavorful but was OK. The vegetable (corn & rajas) taco was full of just mooch as it lacked flavor and texture. The wild caught fish taco was yellow tail on my visit. The tiny taco was tasty but the fish was over cooked ($7.50) and it seemed expensive to me for such a tiny taco with very little fish in it.   Your best bet is to come for Happy Hour and take advantage of it."}
{"text":"Great looking place!  They start you with a bean dip, salsa and real tortilla chips.... Great!  After that it all went downhill with the corn chowder soup. I is supposed to be freshly made...NOT!!!  It was cold and the cream had a crust as if it had been seating for a while...  The Mexican chicken salad is totally bland and lacked any flavor!  Of all our choices of places to eat in Scottsdale....  This will not be be it again!   For chips and guacamole... Maybe...."}
{"text":"Great spot for a fast meal! Food came out so quick it would make your head spin.  I enjoyed their grilled taco plate. Generous portion of fish and fresh toppings. The spicy cole slaw and black beans were great accompaniments.   The grilled chicken burrito looked delicious as well but my date didn't  care for the red sauce they use for enchilada style.   Good service and beautiful decor."}
{"text":"Great food for a great price on Taco Tuesday!  Regular menu items are on the expensive side, but street tacos and margaritas on Taco Tuesday can't be beat.  Love the chips and salsa/dip for a complimentary starter, and the pork carnitas tacos and the fish tacos were super yummy.  My guy had the carne asada tacos and the chicken tacos and loved them.  We had excellent service as well, attentive but not pushy.  This place has a great ambiance, dim lighting and live music made it a fun and cozy date night!  I highly recommend, we will be back!"}
{"text":"This place brings back true Mexican cuisine in North Scottsdale. I'm excited to go back because the food and service were outstanding! I wish I remember our servers name so you could request him, but he was from Spain and had two daughters. If you read this I hope you made the trip back brother. Oh and you must have the street corn...unique and delicious. Thanks guys for a great time"}
{"text":"Perfect place to enjoy California inspired Mexican food, delicious margaritas, and a amazing tacos. Alberto gave us a tour of the menu and recommended the most delicious food and drinks. World class service, yummy food, and the perfect atmosphere to catch up with friends. Highly recommend Sol! Ask for Alberto :)"}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to try SOL at Monday's yelp party.  I'm not a huge fan of Mexican food, but this was different.  I fell in love with the calamari and the dipping sauce it came with.  It was large pieces of calamari with a crispy coconut breading.  I could have eaten that alone all night.  I also loved the mushroom quiesadilla or something like that.  Delicious.  I also like the goat cheese dish and I'm not a fan of goat cheese.  My only complaint is the ceviche... A little to sour and too much onion.  Other than that, I would recommend SOL to a friend."}
{"text":"Tonight was my first time here. Alberto was our server and he was wonderful!  Although it was really busy, he was very attentive and helpful in guiding us through the menu.  Chips and salsa, guacamole, and ceviche were really good.  We wouldn't order the tacos again.  Overall, I'd probably return for happy hour."}
{"text":"If you like jalapeño in your drink, michelada or a Paloma,  you're in the right spot. Started at the bar and the bartenders were excellent!  It's an indoor/outdoor bar, nice when the weather is great. Great Tequila selection.   Had the Calabaza empanadas with side of rice and Mexican corn. Food was yummy and so were the black beans. Service was friendly.   Would definitely return, cool spot."}
{"text":"I have eaten here from time to time for over a year and a half now, and I am always amazed with at least ONE of the items I order.  The hard part is consistency of menu items for me.    I had the Sweet Potato and Black Bean tacos... they were OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!  Unfortunately, the ceviche that i'm accustomed to from them is usually served in a giant bowl with beet chips and a variety of other fixings, which is NOT what I received, and it was definitely a bummer.    If you've never been, you should definitely go, and if you are only looking for cocktails, I had a watermelon margerita, and a blackberry-ginger margerita yesterday that puts their competition to shame.  Go check it out!!!"}
{"text":"What can I say about Sol Cocina that hasn't already been said!  The overall ambiance is vibrant without being over the top loud.  Great choice of classic rock music, and the service is top notch!  Alberto was very attentive, menu knowledgeable and great engagement.  I had the Viper Tacos...amazing grilled chicken with the right amount of spice and extras!   Come one come all!!"}
{"text":"We were on our way to another restaurant when we walked by SOL and decided to try it for lunch.  The ambiance is so cool and unique that it drew us in (good date spot).  I ordered the fish tacos which were tasty, but I thought it was a tad expensive for lunch (I'm one of those who will eat CHEAP lunches, but doesn't mind splurging on dinner... yeah, I don't know).  I believe we ordered the azul margarita which was pretty fresh and delicious.  I'm giving three stars because there was confusion with which margarita was being ordered and I thought we had ordered one size, but a bigger size was brought out so the bill was a bit of a shocker.  The service was okay.  I'm not sure if I'd go back unless it was happy hour and/or I was already in the area."}
{"text":"I have seen this place before on my trips to the area. Stopped in tonight for some good Mexican and drinks. Was not let down at all. There is a good selection of traditional plates to choose from. For me, the selection of tacos is really good. You can order 1 or a dozen and you wouldn't be disappointed in any. My favorite, the filet and shrimp taco. Probably the best taco I've ever had. Also a great selection of drinks from the bar to choose from."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good food,and I will say it's a nice atmosphere inside and outside seating.service was good all around good.. I tell ya the Spicy coleslaw was delish"}
{"text":"First off, you MUST have a reservation here on weekends. I have gone a few times without one and left because the wait is always long.  So I made a reservation one night and we got in right away.  The ambiance is great. Casual Mexican restaurant. Service was fast. Drinks were perfect.  I want to focus on the food. It was SO good that I left there feeling super full because I couldn't stop eating it.  We tried the Hummus and it was to die for. So amazing. Got Tacos as well and they were great.  Let's just say we went to the movies after and I almost went into a food-coma.  Overall, excellent restaurant. Just make a reservation!"}
{"text":"Taylor our waitress was very kind and helpful, she guided us in what to order and her suggestions were amazing the whole family had a good meal, the chips and salsa were delicious they gave us a wide variety of choices, I loved how their tortillas and salsa were homemade and they tasted really good!"}
{"text":"I've gotta be honest, I was really torn on how to rate this restaurant.  For food, hands down, 5 stars.  For service, I was going to say 1 1/2 stars originally, but in the end they \"redeemed themselves\" a little, so i'll be nice and say 3 stars.  And for people watching, it's 3 1/2 stars.   I was visiting a friend in AZ and she and her girlfriends took me there.  It was a Saturday night and the restaurant was packed.  We went to the outside bar to grab drinks while we waited for our table.  The cucumber jalapeno martini was mmmm-delish!  Had the right kick to it.  Problem was the bartender put our drinks down and then abandoned us before we could pay.  When our table was ready, we attempted to pay but the bartender became completely absent.  Fearful we would lose our table we started to walk away while stayed behind to explain to him that we would like the drinks transferred to our dinner bill.  I wasn't around to hear the rest of the exchange, but let's just say I was told that it wasn't pleasant and in fact the bartender was very condescending.   Once at our table, it took about 20 minutes before anyone even came over to greet us and/or ask us if we wanted water, guacamole or even place our order.  When someone finally did acknowledge us, it was only to tell us that he is not our waiter, so we waited an additional 10 min and then when the same guy returned he quickly admitted that he was in fact our waiter (okaaayyyy).  The food itself was fantastic.  Their guacamole is truly gourmet as they add goat cheese or something to it that makes it decadent.  They also serve it with mini fried tortillas instead of chips, excellent choice.  I had a two taco combo with their sweet potato black bean taco and shrimp taco dorado.  It was excellent.  Then we topped it off with their Banana Dark Chocolate Bread Pudding which was truly out of this world scrumptious.  So just when I felt were all in a good space on this restaurant, the weirdest thing happened.   The manager came by and asked us if everything was ok -- a nice move and not unexpected -- but then he muttered \"So was it worth the wait ladies?\"  Felt kind of backhanded to us.  In the end, the waiter came over and told us that the dessert was on them for the long wait, which we definitely appreciated.  in the end, I'm hoping that our experience with the staff was just a result of us catching the servers on a bad night!  I would absolutely recommend this place because the food is just too good to pass up!"}
{"text":"Whoa what a difference since the last time I was there! We shared a couple of dishes and I it was so delicious I couldn't stop eating, literally. They changed the chips too and they're much better now! Great foo, great service! So glad I gave them another chance and have the opportunity to update my 1 star prior review to 5!"}
{"text":"Muy delicioso! Superb service, fresh, authentic food and nice atmosphere. We had the guacamole, and street tacos. Tasty and good quality all around. Muchas gracias!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Scottsdale!  What a great find. Super convenient location. Great service. Excellent food and reasonable prices.  Loved all the varieties of guacamole and the peel and eat shrimp were delicious!!! Can't wait to return and try more of the dishes."}
{"text":"One word: fantastic!! From the service to the food this place delivered.   The chips and salsa that they start you off with is a little different than normal. The server gives a tray with lime, salt, and something hot to mix in if you'd like to add heat the the salsas! They have a standard one and a black bean one. Our server told us we'd fall for the black bean and we did - you will too!   The actual entrees came efficiently. We didn't wait longer than 10-15 minutes. I had the carne asada burrito with the quinoa salad & jalapeño slaw. Oh. My. GOD. If you're a quinoa fan definitely get the salad!!!! I swear it's the best thing I've had in a very long time! The burrito itself was great especially with a little salsa and guac smeared on the side. The $14 price tag really isn't asking too much - I ate half the burrito (yay lunch for today!).   All in all, I'll be coming back here. It's a little far for us to frequent often but it's a nice spot in Scottsdale that isn't too hard on the wallet. We paid $37 (without tip) for two entrees and a margarita (we checked in on Yelp so we got $3 off the drink)."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a light lunch.  Really liked the vibe of the restaurant.  Nice decor.  The waiter was very upbeat an informative.  Started with the guacamole.  Made at the table.  Left two large chucks of avocado and it was not seasoned well.  Ordered grilled fish tortas.  It had a distinct charred taste that I really didn't care for.  My friend had the fish torts as well and thought he swallowed a bone.  I started chewing more carefully and found a bone.  We notified the waiter and he assured us that had never happened.  Without our asking, the waiter had the manager come over who again reiterated that it had never happened before and he generously comped our meal, even though we insisted that he did not need to do that.    We decided to give the place a try for dinner later in the week.  We were again disappointed.  Same problem with the guacamole, and it was not mixed thoroughly, with the first bite one of our group had being very salty.  I started with the tortilla soup with chicken and was very disappointed.  Probably the least flavorful tortilla soup I have every had.  I followed that up with the Carnitas Street Taco Plate.  I found the food bland, lacking flavor with nothing good to say other than it was filling.  The other three guys with me did not find anything that might make them want to return to Sol.  The service was outstanding, however.  Summary:  Great service, great ambiance, great service, blah food.  AVOID."}
{"text":"I was in Scottsdale again for work and having tried everything in this shopping area and the wait at another place was 45 minutes (on a Tuesday!) we found SOL and tried it!  The tacos were really good - our waiter suggested the sweet potato and black bean - it sounds odd, but it was YUMMY - I wished I had ordered two of those!  I also got the three meat one and it was good, just too big to be a street taco, I had to use my fork.  The skinny margarita was really good as well.  The only down side was how LOUD the place was - it was just me and a friend and we could barely hear each other, the overall atmosphere was really cool and it was a fun place, but the live music at 7:30 on Tuesday wasn't necessary :)  I will definitely try it again and order other tacos that looked good (but the sweet potato one will be hard to beat) :). Our waiter was attentive but not pushy and did a good job, we were seated quickly, so I can't complain at all about the service."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a few drinks before meeting my sister for a  shopping date. I had the cucumber jalapeño margarita and it was amazing!  I've tried and can't copy these at home. Guess I'll just have to keep coming back.   Even their chips and salsa are amazing. I haven't tried their food yet but if their food is as good as their margaritas, I'm sure I won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour at the bar. Enjoyed an excellent frozen margarita made with a premium agave tequila. Yum! Bartenders were very informed on the many quality tequilas Sol has to offer. Perfect to enjoy with the Baja inspired happy hour specials. The Chilie Gordo pepper appetizer was amazing. Of course we never pass on the large, tasty chips and gourmet guacamole. So good..."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Scottsdale. Steak burrito served we \"wet\" with melted cheese on top is great."}
{"text":"was pretty disappointed that the goat cheese enchiladas are a seasonal item on the menu. we come here only for that but decide to give it a try and glad we did. our amazing server armando suggested we try the warm goat cheese appetizer, and it was life changing. best thjng EVER. my favorite restaurant in all of the quarter and kierlands. will definitely be back soon and ask for armando :)"}
{"text":"Margaritas were excellent. Chips unique as they're taco shells. Loved the salsa, bean dip, and guacamole. Tacos excellent."}
{"text":"While my daughter was attending a birthday party across the street, a couple of the dads and I decided to escape the estrogen-driven affair by grabbing lunch and some drinks at SOL.   When I walked in, I was very impressed with the vibe. It's dimly lit, but not TOO dim, giving it a nice intimate feel. Now, being three husbands seeking respite from arguably the most estrogen-driven place in Scottsdale (Girly Girlz), we weren't looking for \"intimate\". So, we found our way to the bar.   The bar at SOL is very cool. Half of the bar is inside the restaurant, while the other half is outside on the patio covered by awesome red awnings. The middle of the bar is where the bartender makes her rounds. Directly above the bar is a beautiful hanging shelf loaded with tequila from wall to wall. On the far right and left sides of the bar (both inside and out), there are televisions. We tried to find a seat out on the patio side, but the weather was so nice this day, there wasn't a chance we'd find a seat...let alone three.  So, we ended up inside. No biggie. We could still feel the breeze flowing through the bar from outside. Like I said...the bar is VERY cool.  We debated on whether or not we wanted food. But, after seeing the menu, what choice did we really have? From the brunch menu to the dinner menu, literally everything sounded amazing.   Being that I'm TRYING to eat healthier these days, I gravitated towards the skinny grilled chicken burrito. It's essentially a grilled chicken salad wrapped in a flour tortilla. It sounds simple enough...but trust me when I tell you that the taste is FAR from simple. It was also quite large. I REALLY wanted to eat the whole thing by myself, and I absolutely could have. However, the burrito was so good, I would have felt guilty if I couldn't have shared the other half with my wife. I feel like she would have missed out on something amazing in life had she not been afforded the opportunity to taste it. When I brought the other half home to MY better half, the look on her face when she took a bite of it was all the proof that I needed to know that I had done the right thing.  The food and atmosphere are fantastic. Our service was mediocre...but, it WAS really packed...especially for a Sunday afternoon. Though, it was right in the heart of March Madness. The burrito was so good, it kind of covered up the lackluster service from the bartender.  One other detractor, at least for us, was the placement of the televisions. We appreciated the fact that the televisions were there, but they were definitely not equally visible from every seat at the bar. In fact, if you end up having to sit in the middle of the bar (like we did), you'll have to crane your neck VERY awkwardly if you want to see either television.  One last note...SOL does not have beer on tap...just bottles. I'm not sure if that's a plus or a minus. I just found it interesting."}
{"text":"The interior was beautiful but the food....not so much. We went during lunch and three of us had different meals. None of us liked what we ordered. For the price, I think not. And to be honest, even if the food was cheap I would still say no thank you. Good try though. PS Don't expect salt and peper shakers because they don't have any."}
{"text":"The service was outstanding and the food was very fresh and better than expected.  The bean puree is delicious. I ordered the Taco Vampiro and the Beer Battered Shrimp Taco both were amazing. I have to say  they may have been the best little taco's I have ever had...Everything is made fresh there everyday... If  you like Mexican food or not I would  not miss having lunch or dinner..."}
{"text":"Had a very nice dining experience here.  The menu is a few notches above the average Mexican restaurant, for sure.  Lots to choose from.  I had the short ribs which were deliciously tender and savory.  My husband has the pork carnitas which he also enjoyed.  We both had the spicy slaw as a side--and, yes it was spicy.  Kids chose tacos and burritos and both plates were demolished.  Lots of margarita choices.  Mine was okay--no matter where I go I find them a bit too sweet.  Server was good and knew his stuff.  Always bothers me when servers can't explain items on the menu or don't know what's in a dish.  The adjacent shopping area looked like a good place to spend a few hours but we were there later on. Sunday.  Def recommend."}
{"text":"If you're a fan of Macayo's like my elderly parents, you will not like this place. Mom & dad don't want to go back here.  That's fine because it means more food for me when I go. :)  The server sets everything up by explaining that they're more of an interior Mexican restaurant so things aren't necessarily spicy. However, most of the food that I had came with a healthy burn so don't think you're in for a gringo experience. The bean dip was a nice touch and the salsa was excellent.  My only quibble with the meal was I expected more of a stack from the stacked enchiladas. There's only one layer to them. I expect a couple of layers when I order something like that.  The margaritas aren't cheap but they're good."}
{"text":"My favs are the shrimp taco dorado, street corn, tostadas with bean dip, shrimp chile relleno and the list goes on!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Waitress was very informative but overall service was just average. Looked like they kept having server meetings. Had to go the bar and get my own drink once.  Food was good but not great.  Did street tacos...very tasty but have had better.  Margaritas we're very good."}
{"text":"Aah, I am a little torn on the stars... More like 3.5. I liked the food and the service was good but... This ended up not being the best experience.  Our server was very nice and friendly, the food we ordered was good, the location is nice, no issues with parking and we went for a walk around the block afterwards.  But... I always ask for a booth when we make a reservation and I think they do not have booths, but we were seated by the bar on a tall table... ok, my bad for not protesting but I did not think the table/chair arrangement was comfortable.  I wanted a steak, and I thought I had seen steak on their online menu, but the menu we got had just tacos, tortas, etc. I asked to get the full menu but apparently we had a misunderstanding and I was told that was it... well, not. Later I found out we got the lunch menu, hence the lack of dish options.  Aaaaand, there was a delay with our appetizer. Our server apologized and we told him it was fine... the delay. However, once we finally got it (queso/chorizo/mushrooms), the rest of our food came right after, so we didn't fully enjoy either and the table was quite crowded.   Chile ancho and pumpkin seeds (pepitas) seem to be a very big part of their menu and I enjoyed them very much.  About the chips, I would not call them chips, they are more like full or half tostadas, with sprinkles of chile. Salsa and black bean dip were tasty.  Appetizer: The queso was good, with chorizo, mushroom and raw jalapeno slices. It came with 4 yellow corn tortillas and I think that was my favorite food. I had a 'taste' of the corn/poblano soup and I did like it a lot too, but the portion was super tiny, The container was pretty much the size of the soup spoon. I was expecting a full cup, but oh well, I cannot claim to be deceived, the menu says 'taste'. This item was in fact really good, like liquid 'tamal de rajas' : ) I also had the grilled calamari and while it was good, the marinade tasted quite sweet and I did not like that part. Hubby had the garlic chicken torta and he thought it was OK. About sides, we had the spicy slaw (kind of bland and blah... I did not think it was spicy and did not find it flavorful) and the cranberry quinoa, which was good mainly because the cranberries were very sweet. : )  For dessert we shared a 'blondie' and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Outstanding flavors and service at this spot. The filet and shrimp street tacos are definitely worth trying. For heavy meat eaters, you must experience the braised short ribs. Very tender and seasoned to perfection. Our server Ed, topped off our experience. Young man with huge culinary dreams and very funny. We learned that the chef hails from the Newport Beach Ca store, which is frequently featured on the hit Bravo show The Housewives of Orange County. She is definitely bringing her \"A\" game, with respect to the quality control of each meal. Only negative, you can tell the restaurant has only been open for about 10 days. However, time will cure that.   Ed and Carla Henderson NV"}
{"text":"SOL Cocina is one of my favorite Scottsdale Quarter restaurants because it's upscale Mexican food in a classy, romantically lit setting accented by stone walls and comfy seating. Stellar service elevates the meal, which is what my friend Beth and I experienced on a recent invitation to try new menu items by chef Deborah Schneider.  Manager Jason and server Taylor expertly guided us through the menu and made fantastic recommendations for my vegetarian tastes and my friend's inclusive palate. We paired our meals with SOL's House Margarita ($8.50), a perfect balance of Agavales Blanco, freshly squeezed orange juice, sour mix and a splash of Patron Citronge Regular. The drink wasn't too sweet or overpowered with an alcohol taste, making it a refreshingly cool classic choice.  For food, we started with the Guacamole Sol, made with mango, tequila, onions, goat cheese, pepita and cilantro ($10.75). The appetizer is one of the restaurant's most popular, and I love the flash of a table-side preparation. My favorite part of the Guacamole Sol was the goat cheese, which enhanced the guacamole with a nice tangy flavor. Every table gets housemade chips and salsa, with crunchy mini tostadas to break apart and dip into sauces.  We also tried the Grilled Sweet Corn ($6), half-sized ears slathered in butter, lime, chiles, cotixa cheese and a chipotle drizzle. Be warned it's an appetizer that's a bit messy to consume, but Beth said, \"The corn was cooked just right, with a creamy and tangy chipotle sauce that made it different than any Mexican corn I've had - in a good way.\" I liked the topping, as well, but I think it'd be so cool if there was a kernel-only option to keep fingers clean.  SOL has an extensive menu of a la carte tacos, with new offerings including the Grilled Agave-Chile Shrimp Taco ($11), which comes with a whopping three large shrimp and guacamole; and the Viper Taco ($6.50), which comes kicked up with a spicy ghost chile and chipotle salsa, avocado and onion. Our server was gracious enough to suggest an off-the-menu sweet potato taco, which was bursting with veggies--\"It was delicious, coming from a non-vegetarian,\" Beth said--and Beth also tried the Taco Vampiro ($8.50), which had the most tender carne asada she has ever had. \"The double-layer corn tortillas, held together by the serrano chiles, cheese and scallions, helped keep the meat and toppings from falling out, which I appreciated. The taco had just the right mix of meat, guacamole, cheese and other toppings,\" Beth said.  For my meal, I tried the new fall version of the Goat Cheese Enchiladas ($15), made with menonito and jack cheese, green salsa, queso fresco, cotixa cheese and crema. I definitely loved the three-cheese stuffing, but if you're not a sauce fan, ask to go easy on it, since the dish was swimming in sauce. I loved how fresh the entrée tasted, and it was a huge portion.  We were too full for dessert, but if you save room, try the new Pastel Tres Leches '1921', a house-made white cake soaked in cream, evaporated milk, and 1921 tequila liqueur ($9.50). Other new menu items include red pozole, oysters and scallops dishes, shortribs barbacoa, and a grilled agave-chile shrimp torta."}
{"text":"Muy beuno! Between the atmosphere, food and drinks, all I can say is...muy bueno!   I am so happy that Sol decided to make the Scottsdale Quarter home. This is the perfect restaurant to visit for lunch during an afternoon of shopping, or for a date night later that evening!   The vibe here is calm, cool and collected. It's on the darker side which makes for a cool escape on a hot day. I can't wait for the weather to cool down so I can take advantage of their nice patio as well!   I love the drinks here, especially the skinny margaritas! They have the perfect amount of carbonation which I love in a cocktail. The bartenders are super friendly, as is all the staff!   Now let's talk about the food. I love the food here! It's quite simple. This is delicious Mexican food. The table-side guac is creamy and comes with large tostadas! Throw in some of their spicy salsa and it's sublime. Their carne asada is some of the best I've ever tasted thanks to their seasoning and tenderness of the meat. I also absolutely love their fish tacos! The sauce they use with the combination of cabbage and fish wrapped up into a tortilla is second to none. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it! I also like how they sell the tacos individually on the menu. This means that you can order one fish taco and one carne asada, or whatever combination you feel like! Each taco is about $4 but be warned, they are filling!"}
{"text":"SOOOOO nice I had to try it twice! Whenever I am back in the Scottsdale area, I like to eat my old but goodie spots but also try out some new ones! I went to SOL at Scottsdale Quarter a few nights ago and had their Chipolte Shrimp Tacos, it was so good that I had to go back and this time I ordered their grilled burrito. The food is great but once I tried ordering off the menu (meaning personalizing my order) the waiter seemed a little frantic. So I suggest just sticking to the menu because it's pretty good!"}
{"text":"I've been there twice for lunch.  Service was slow but ok the first time and slow and unapologetic the second time.  Trendy decor, hip location, nice concept, but just ok food.  Tried the naked guacamole.  It was average.  Very small portion for $8.75.  The Grilled Sweet Corn appetizer is enough for a table for 4.  I was excited for this because I love Mexican grilled corn with all of the fixings.  The chipotle drizzle was bland and the cotixa cheese was minimal.  Left me wanting.  The beans have a slightly sweet taste that I couldn't place.  Caught me off guard, so I wasn't a fan.  The Taco Vampiro, a double tortilla stuffed with melted cheese, chiles, carne asada, guacamole, pico and cheese was the best thing I tasted.  The carne asada was flavorful and tender.  White corn and poblano soup sounded wonderful in the description, but tasted more like puree'd, warmed baby food.  Couldn't finish it.  EVERYTHING needed salt.  This was mentioned both times by all dining with me."}
{"text":"This is an indoor-outdoor bar, with margaritas and cervezas. They serve lots of tortilla chips with salsa or guacamole, which keeps the libations coming.  As for the Mexican food - not so much - pretty standard.  The focus of this place is the lively bar scene on the edge of The Quarter (a mall) - there are lots of 20 and 30-somethings socializing and looking for a good time."}
{"text":"Love the restaurant layout and decor. The chips and salsas provided are really tasty and the entrees were delicious. Alberto really took care of us"}
{"text":"The live music is spectacular! Good margaritas and house wine. We had the 6 street tacos, the battered fish imm rolled by my friend was great,  the carnitas were delicious. However the chicken was meh... just like the corn and the guacamole. All missing something to complete them for sure.  Great ambience and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Cinco de mayo was a dud ! Not impressed at all I've been here a total of 3 times and now it's time to do a legit review.    The wait was extra extra long because of the festivities I suppose.    They ask for your phone number so they can txt you when the table is ready well I never received a message so I had to keep checking in with them so much for that technology service!   The hostess was a doll through it all !! and had a smile on her face the whole time.  The music totally sucked for Cinco de Mayo festivities, all I heard was whack music from the 80's and 90's shit my mom used to listen to even the manager said he didn't know what was up with that.  Even still my little son tipped the musician.   THE FOOD:   Ba Ba Ba Boring !   Maybe I'm being a bit harsh but just keeping it 100% real on my Personal experience.    Taco Vampario   Double tortilla with melted cheese, serrano chiles & scallions, carne asada, guacamole & pico de gallo topped with cotixa , chipotle aioli & cilantro.   The meat was cold and very red I couldn't eat it.   FISH TACO 'GOBERNADOR' wild-caught fish, pan-roasted with lemon & garlic, on a taco dorado with cheese, salsa gobernador, avocado, onion & cilantro, pico & lettuce  The fish taco was delicious very fresh w/ just the right amount of citrus,  IF I ever go back this is what I'd order.    Sol has nice atmosphere but it was a rather insipid plate of tacos! and run-of-the-mill beans and rice that left a boring taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"for the latest yelp event, we were absolutely thrilled at the delicious food they offered. there were loads and loads of tasters, ceviche, guacamole, tostados, goat cheese? yes, goat cheese and it was good.   my favorite was the shrimp gazpacho. it was cold and tomato-ey and had a quick punch to the taste buds with its heat. i also had the rice and beans sampler and that too was extremely tasty and filling. my drinks consisted of count em...2 skinny margaritas (gotta watch my figure!), and they were mighty powerful for a skinny drink. the crunchy big salt chunks were a nice addition!  i would come back for their regular menu based on how good their food was for the event!"}
{"text":"Vegetarian sweet potato and black bean tacos are AMAZING!!! We also ordered the guacamole beforehand. This place has amazing Mexican food and caters to both vegetarian and meat eaters. It was perfect for my husband and I !"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, good reviews, great location and I love Mexican Food! Service was lackluster and my carne asada tacos were very undercooked, they removed them from my bill however I already consumed one. Also, for being happy hour prices were great but food was underwhelming ."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I like to frequent the movie theater in the Scottsdale Quarter but we only stop for dinner and Sol is our spot! We first came here in October of last year because of our first date and it has been our spot ever since I always get the chicken burrito with some lettuce wraps and the shrimp firing squad, makes me hungry just thinking about it. Our favorite server has to be Holden! He is always on point with our orders especially mine because I like to change things up a lot. He is also a genuine good person and seems to enjoy his job and takes a lot of pride at it. we've been going here for about a year and he has always been our server. I don't usually write stuff about the servers of restaurants but this guy always goes above and beyond I'm surprised he doesn't have his own restaurant. As for the food it's always good and very fresh I should probably change it up and start trying some new things but you can never go wrong with a chicken burrito lol."}
{"text":"Such a wonderful spot to meet friends for drinks or dinner! The food is spot on and the indoor/outdoor bar area creates the ideal vibe. Perfectly located in the Quarter  right next to the parking garage."}
{"text":"This place has awesome Mexican food. It's pretty pricy but I think it's worth it. Beautiful atmosphere and very nice staff. I miss their food. Should go back soon"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and great food! Order the Taco vampiro and the street corn appetizer"}
{"text":"I had the carnitas street tacos with rice and beans.  Very bland, dry, not at all flavorful and very SMALL!  Was with a party of 3 on a Wednesday night at 7:30 and had to ask for chip refill 3 times before we actually had our request granted.  Black beans were dry and bland and the red rice I would compare to something you add water to and steam on the stove top, not impressed.    If you want to go hob knob with the pretty people and pay too much for less than par food/service, then enjoy...I won't be back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Service was very fast and very good. Food was served with very little wait even though they were crowed. I order beef tacos with black beans and rice. It had an excellent taste and the presentation was very nice. Also had chicken stuffed burrito which was huge and very tasty but had too many black beans, especially since we had them as a side dish(hence 4 stars). Naked guacamole was as good as it gets and the large tortilla chips and salsa were the best."}
{"text":"Wow.  What incredibly poor service.  Where should I begin.  Had to ask for my drink several times before the waiter realized I was thirsty.  The portions were anemic. The attentiveness of the wait staff was non-existent. Then when the bill was presented, none of the drinks were at the happy hour prices, despite all of them being ordered during happy hour. The waiter was useless, as was the manager. If not for witnesses, might still be there arguing whether or not sauvignon blanc was a white wine or some bizarre color other than red or white, which were the only two choices on the happy hour menu. Will never go back.  Which is too bad.  Good parking, good location... just incredibly poor service.  Perhaps the worst I've ever had in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointing overall - if they can't get chips and salsa \"right\" - hard to have much optimism for other menu items .  No value here at all"}
{"text":"We made reservations thru open table so no wait for us. Service was good. Our meals were amazing. I ordered the chipotle chicken and it was seasoned/cooked perfectly, just enough kick not to make it another boring chicken dish. Black beans and slaw sides were tasty. My boyfriend loved his tacos, with the vampiro being the standout. My only complaint is the street corn, please don't be stingy with the toppings!  We will most definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"I have been into SOL many times and really don't expect too much when I go.  The margaritas have tasted different each time.  Bartenders seem to free pour too much and aren't consistent with one another.  The bartenders however, are very aware and social which is a plus.   I will say that the Naked Guac is really good in addition to the Civeche Sol.   The bar area is a little difficult to get to once people are seated in the restaurant. The bar itself is beautiful and neat but not convenient if you have more than 4 in your party.   The only reason I stayed with 2 stars is because I have not seem a bathroom like this since a college frat party.  There were paper towels all over the ground and the divider for the mens urinal looks like it is about to fall off the wall at any time.   The bathroom is used by staff in addition to patrons so I would think there is an opportunity to have it a little nicer.."}
{"text":"Met family here on a Thursday evening. Place was hoppin'! Brother enjoyed his margaritas (check in with Yelp for $5 margaritas) and crispy tortillas with dipping sauces were so yummy. Server was very attentive and very accommodating, as our party arrived in batches. Pluses: The food! Shared a chile relleno (unbattered,which is a welcome change) and a shrimp taco. Both were scrumptious: full of flavor and a bit spicy, but not too spicy. Small chiles on the plate mean you can increase the heat level, if you desire. Minuses: Noise level is LOUD and it's hard to hear from one end of the 6 top to the other. Sitting by the open kitchen in a booth will make you SWEAT! Don't recommend it. I didn't enjoy overheating, but I loved the food, so I would go back, definitely sit far from the kitchen, and snarf more of their delicious offerings."}
{"text":"Upscale Mexican in Scottsdale Square with fantastic food and drinks they make from scratch. 4.5 stars  Food: 4.5, Atmosphere: 4.5, Service: 4.5 Cost to worth it rating: 4 (pricey with small guac at $8.75 and a la carte tacos at $6.50-$10.75 but excellent quality) Opentableable. Yes, Kid's menu: yes Return worthiness: yes  Highlights: - Shrimp chipotle taco: plump shrimp with tons of flavor with a bit of a kick. 5 stars. - Duck carnitas: duck confit on top of 3 tortillas to make your own. It had a blackberry sauce on the side but it didn't even need it. Duck was flavorful on its own. 4.5 stars  - Guacamole: very fresh, bit smaller portion compared to other spots. 4 stars  - Cucumber jalapeño margarita: loved the balance of heat and soothing coolness. 2 sizes: tiny of pint glass. 5 stars  - Quesadilla: was my kids order but all of us were jealous. The tortilla looked awesome and melty cheese busting out. 5 stars - Full tortillas as chips: fun to have these large crispy saucers. Only concern was the inequal spicing: some had none--great for my son--and some were covered in it. - Salsas: had a spicy tomato and a mild thicker mole which was a great twist. 4 stars  Midlights;  - Carne asada tacos: just ok. Everything else was outstanding, so just ok stood out a bit. My hub ordered these and stole some quesadilla and duck.  Lowlights: - Parking: gets a bit crowded in this outdoor mall spot   Really enjoyed this place for a nice dinner and would come back."}
{"text":"Given the size of the restaurant and the amount of volume they do, I expected the food quality to suffer on a busy Sunday morning. However, I was pleasantly surprised to have my first impression proven wrong.     The waitress did a good job of walking us through the menu. She said \"we have some really good items so I just want to make sure you know what they are so you have a good experience.\"  Started with the El Sol guacamole - prepped table-side. It was nice and chunky and the cheese put a nice twist on it.   For mains I ordered the Carlotta which turned out to be a massive tower of crunchy, sweetness topped with some amazing vanilla cream and fresh fruit. You can get it \"with meat\" so I ordered it with bacon to add some saltiness to my plate. Warning - this dish turns heads. I had two people literally stop and gawk at my breakfast as I was trying to dig in.   My companion ordered two of the tacos - the vampiro (spicy) and the Xolo. The meat was well-cooked and flavorful for both. Overall great little tacos with fresh and interesting ingredients. They do have a taco on the menu that's made with ghost chiles - the Viper. I'd like to note that the waitress was very polite as she recommended we stay away from it (unless we were really in the mood for spicy... Apparently we didn't look like we were in the mood).  Only reason I'm dinging them for a star is because the size of the Carlotta was so massive that I could barely eat a quarter of it. It also had a lot of \"chewiness\" in the center of the toast which wasn't that appealing. The crunchy outside was def the best part."}
{"text":"I had my son's wedding rehersal dinner here and it was great. I worked with Shelly via email and it worked out fine. The food was surprisingly good. Guests told me they loved it. We had a nice private room and our own bartender. The service was excellent. The price was reasonable and there were no surprises. I highly recommend Sol."}
{"text":"This was actually my second visit here after having a not so good first visit a couple years ago. I remembered the food not being very good and the service didn't make up for it. Since then a lot has changed and I am happy to say!   I was greeted promptly by the friendly hostess and told her I was going to sit at the bar and she brought me a happy hour menu and a regular menu. Bartender immediately poured me a glass of water asked me if I had any questions about the happy hour menu and then gave me a few minutes to decide. So far they're winning! I chose Don Julio house margarita with no salt and in addition to my margarita I was brought complementary chips and salsa with a spicy bean dip which was excellent.   For food I opted for the Queso con mushrooms with jalapeños and chorizo, served with corn tortillas. This was so delicious and not at all oily like some places. The chorizo complimented the texture of the cheese and spice of the jalapeños. My only complaint of this whole experience is that one of my tortillas broke:(  The service was great- I don't remember her name- cute blondish girl. She wasn't overbearing but also there quickly when I needed her. You could tell she had a good relationship with the regulars at the bar which is always good to see!   I'll definitely add Sol Mexican Cocina to the rotation!"}
{"text":"Yummy!  Elaborate but simple menu with robust flavors from the chips and salsa to the main course.  Great customer service and a very friendly staff that appear to take pride in their work.  We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Great upscale decor and atmosphere. Chips and salsa are unique and very tasty. Bean dip needs a lot of work. Guacamole was incredible. My shrimp dorado tacos were delicious. My partner's chicken tacos were grilled a little too long and tasted burnt. I know some people prefer this but we didn't enjoy them. Service was fast and friendly. I'd recommend you sit outside if it's nice out. They have fans and heaters out there depending on the weather. Great for a first date or just drinks too."}
{"text":"The chips and black bean salsa that are complimentary are amazing. We ordered the SOL guacamole. It has a perfect blend of goat cheese and mango added. Simply delicious and well balanced flavors. I ordered a jalapeño margarita which was average (same as you'll taste in any AZ restaurant). We choose a la cart tacos. Here is where extra stars come in. I like hot food. Ghost pepper hot and the hottest wings never phase me. Then comes their viper taco... Great blend of flavors and a sauce so hot no amount of water will chill the heat. A+"}
{"text":"We had a delicious brunch at Sol Mexican Cocina. Both the Huevos Rancheros and the Chiliquiles were big hits as were the Bloody Marys. We've been to Sol many times for dinner, but this was our first brunch experience, and it won't be our last!"}
{"text":"Not bad! Mexican cuisine is probably my least favorite choice of food, but this place wasn't bad at all! I came here on a date last Saturday. The hostess said the wait was about 50 minutes but we got sat in 20! It was busy and the service took a while but we understood it was a busy night. The Magaritas were my favorite part of the meal!"}
{"text":"Great drinks, good service and food.  Not inexpensive, but a nice meal and experience. Took the waiter's suggestion for a mushroom queso dish as appetizer and it was good--melted gooey  cheese. Had grilled fish taco platter and roasted pork platter.  Both were very good.  If you have sodium sensitivity, expect your rings to be a little tight.   kids had burritos, which were great.  Enjoyed the drink offerings and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Love this place! Have only been here 3 or 4 times, but we have always had great service (lookin atchu Alberto) and the food is soo so good. The sweet corn is always great as an appetizer to share because of its vast portions and all the tacos are absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"The food is good but the service is terrible. Our attendant lost one of the credit cards to split the check. It took too long to get her attention. But I would say the food is above average."}
{"text":"First of all, why is there so much seasoning on the tostadas? The ambience is nice but the food is very over seasoned and has a particular bad flavor that none of us could put our finger on. The prices are also pretty steep for the quality of food you're given. Like many other reviewers I also had poor service. The waitress seemed bothered to help us and was often awkward in how she handled normal interactions. Needless to say, I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I love what they did with the old Parc Central space.  The indoor/outdoor bar is really a nice addition.  I had their guacamole and also the carne asada tacos.  Good but not anything super special."}
{"text":"One of my favorite choices for Mexican. Menu is traditional with a modern twist. Ingredients are flavorful and fresh. Guacamole is superb. Restaurant ambiance/decor is excellent."}
{"text":"The hot and cold ceviche is ridiculous here. Management are approachable, friendly and warm. Happy hour and tequila Thursday makes it way more affordable.  The margis are delicious !!"}
{"text":"Words cannot even begin to express how thankful I am for everything you did for me today. My birthday happy hour was a HUGE success thanks to the wonderful staff at Sol Cocina.  Sharon, thank you so much for making sure me and my guest had plenty of places to sit and mingle. That area was PERFECT! Lorena, girl you took care of about 40 people in a 3+ hour time frame! You ROCKED! Thank you so much. Josh, OMG Josh! Thank you so much for putting up my \"rowdy\" group LOL!  Seriously, your entire team welcomed me with open arms and everyone had a great time. The food and the drinks, OMG the drinks!! Thank you to Sol Cocina for keeping the Farmers Market-Strawberry-Kiwi Margarita on the menu for me for that extra day. It was DELICIOUS!! ( I stopped at two but I really wanted three) Up next... Taco Tuesday anyone? :)"}
{"text":"The food here is excellent. I got the Ensenada fish taco Plato & my boyfriend got the lobster and shrimp enchiladas, also super tasty. The only downside is that they had us sit on the outside patio even though I wanted a indoor table. Claiming it would be a 25 minute wait although there were plenty of open indoor seats. Also they forgot to bring out my guacamole appetizer. The waiter comped me for it but it would've been nice to have with my fish tacos."}
{"text":"Loved it! Made a reservation for three at 7 p.m. on a Friday night - it was definitely packed, but tables were moving fast enough that it was never over-crowded or overwhelming. The comp. chips and salsa delivered to us right away were delicious (seriously...what is in that salsa?!), and our server was very friendly and prompt. I loved that she didn't make us feel rushed - she gave us ample time between ordering drinks and food and made it an experience! These days, I feel like that's hard to find.   The food itself was pretty yummy. It's hard to impress me when it comes to tacos, but I enjoyed my grilled fish! The Spanish rice and quinoa salad was delicious, too! Would come back to this spot for sure."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place...been now a few times and have had good experiences. I recommended coming here with a friend who was visiting from out of town to grab a drink and she was also impressed. The house margarita with a chamboard float is great! We also ate the coconut calamari appetizer....phenomenal! The chips are also a bit unique but are delicious! Saturday night was a bit crazy but would recommend to go for a fun time and good food/drinks!"}
{"text":"Huge fan of the SOL in Newport Beach California, was catching a movie so decided to get a reservation. When we went we got a waiter was non existent. We waited for 10 min to be taken care of. Take in mind they were super busy so I understand, but when you charge an arm and a leg for Mexican food. The reason we are their is not because it's the greatest tacos on earth it's because we want to be taken care of have a couple and enjoy our time. Once we got taken care of for drinks, we did not see our waiter again for another 10 min and we got chips and salsa with no water or anything. I got up and went to the bar and got water for us. Then our drinks were dropped off by someone else and my drinks was wrong. But could not tell my waiter took it to the bar myself. And had it changed out. By the time we worsened appetizers we were their for 45 min. And 2 drinks down. Long story short second drink. Ever came. Food orders late 2 hours of the worst service I have ever gotten. Food was okay. I just asked for the check. Got charged for 3 drinks had to send the bill back and wait Ten minutes again for that to be done. Bill was a  100 dollars for one fish dish one guacamole and calamari. Our fish of the day was 44 dollars lol really. 44 dollars. All good making sure to not set foot back in this place and let others know to do the same. Food me once! Thanks. Save your money and go somewhere else where the Serice and the food are up to par!     Btw no one ever reached out to us messaged us about this. Show how much they care!"}
{"text":"Somehow has figured out a way to make Mexican food even better. They have some of the traditional dishes but lots of creative twists. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"5 stars all day long the food is amazing and the drinks are great. Popped in while Devin and Wally were working and had a great experience the vibe was fun and despite having an ac issue those two kept the spirits at the bar high but don't confuse the playful nature of these two their tequila knowledge and ability to walk even a newbie like me through their large amount of spirits and help me find what I was looking for. Would recommend this place for sure. Service was out freaking standing good hires awesome training all around props to the management team."}
{"text":"TACO TUESDAYS are bomb dot com! Great deals and savory tacos. I usually go for the steak tacos and the steak is juicy and tender with a hint of a fire's sizzle. I Miss the little ceviche cocktails they used to have on the taco Tuesday menu. But regardless, their ceviche is very authentically \"norteño\"! Lastly, the ambiance is excellent,  they have live music almost every time I'm there."}
{"text":"I don't give out 5 star ratings lightly. Less that 30% of my reviews are 5 star, but Sol deserves it. It is definitely my new favorite Mexican restaurant.  I have been here a few times and being a new restaurant in the area, have endevored to try different things on the menu. I have yet to find something that wasn't perfect in taste, temperature or presentation. The food on the menu surpasses any typical Mexican cuisine by a wide margin. The unusual pairing of ingredients is sheer culinary genius. I would not have expected goat cheese to be something in guacamole, but I don't think I can have guacamole any other way now.  Their variety of tacos focusing on seafood more than meat is more than welcome. Each is full of flavor that has your mouth watering before it reaches your mouth. The ability to order them a la carte or in a combo should satisfy anyone.  The Ceviche de Coco \"Cabo\" was incredible. Coconut, fuit, lime, avocado all coming together for a spectacular combination.  The staff is very knowledgable and made great suggestions when overwhelmed with what to try.   The Calamari is some of the best with a unique hint of orange."}
{"text":"Sol? Good food with very poor service.   We've been there more than once and each time the service has slipped more than the last.   Why would it take over an hour to prepare a salad?   It's too bad; it once was a fun place to visit.  Now, why should I spend hard earned dollars to wait... and wait... and wait for a meal that is decent.... but nuthin' to write home about?   For good Mexican food there are much better options in the same zip code."}
{"text":"Taylor provided us with amazing service and a great smile! Highly recommend the Kobe skirt steak and the shrimp esquite salad! For starters check their sol twist on guacamole! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"We were there on Cinco de Mayo which admittedly would not be the best day to go to a 'Mexican' restaurant for the first time. However, they were adequately staffed and our service was good. Be aware however that my dinner guest and I both thought every single item of food we had was extremely spicy to the point where our mouths were on  fire. And my dinner guest loves extremely spicy food but was still uncomfortable. That said, overall, it was a pleasant experience and I would return."}
{"text":"not i impressed.....foodf ..just..ok...chips too salty..tacos..not good.. but Service was excellent....sat at bar and ordered food to go.. drinks were....good first round but then only sweet and sour the second round.... tyoo much hype..wont come back"}
{"text":"Our waitress was a doll.  Our drinks were yummy and the food was good.   I had a big comfy chair (mini couch)  My issue was:   No table settings so when our appetizer arrived we had to hunt someone down for plates, napkins and silverware before we could eat.  (Pet Peve). We had the only candle that did not work,  our waitress did not really care so we switched it out with an empty table.  Dead plant right  next to us!  Pull that thing out put a fake one in or do something!!  It was gross to look at!   Large candles sitting on floor 4'tall. Not lite but stuffed with peoples trash.    When pointed out to waitress she just laughed and made light of.  (Already knowing it was like that).  I feel no one took accountability to make the surrounding better"}
{"text":"I'm a fan. The food I've tried was excellent, the space is very pretty and nothing beats open air upscale mexican when it's this nice out in AZ. I've seen minor hiccups in service both times - forgetting to bring out something I ordered on the first visit, not bringing out the tostadas and dips when we sat down the second time, incorrectly bringing out tacos when we ordered a burrito. To be fair, they were very apologetic and friendly (and new!) so I barely thought twice about it.   I went two days in a row last week, trying the sol and spicy/tropical ceviche. Both had great quality, though for less than a dollar more, the spicy/tropical is the way to go. It's beautiful, fresh, flavorful. So fun! The sol is a small for the price.  I also had the Ensenada fish tacos, which were small but had great taste. Some of the best flavor outside Ensenada itself. I wish they put the lime sauce on the top vs. underneath where the moisture and heat makes the breading soggy. Lastly, I had the Bufalada taco which was surprisingly hearty and had great flavor from the tortilla to the meat, cheese and guacamole on top!  I wish they had a happy hour since I work so close by! I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"What a great place to grab some yummy Mexican food!  We were actually supposed to go across the street for brunch but when we found out the wait time was 60-90 minutes we decided to look elsewhere. I called on a Sunday around 11:30 am and when the woman told me there was no wait time, we decided to give it a go.  The decor of the place itself is really beautiful. You have an authentic Mexican feel mixed in with a modern twist. We ended up at a high table near the bar and were welcomed with chips and salsa. the chips were huge! Definitely not your typical chips, maybe 6inch in diameter. They were good, and had a flavored salt, but they were a bit stale in my opinion.  I ordered 2 tacos (garlic ribeye steak taco and Taco Bufalada), and they were honestly so delicious. I thought that all the spices and flavors worked well together My boyfriend had the breakfast burrito ad he said it was good also!   We also shared a FRO-MO, oh my god. It was so good!! It's basically a margarita (frozen) and then on top they add orange juice and a splash of sparkling wine. I would go back again just for that!! it was sweet and strong  Overall this place is great, the only downside was that it was bit expensive, so I wouldn't go on a regular basis. Can't wait to be back in the area to try something else on their menu!"}
{"text":"Oh my.... calling Vegan and vegetarians who love spicy Mexican! Sol has so many cruelty free options! I had the butternut squash tacos and the charred cauliflower tacos and they were so amazing! The butternut squash was smokey spicy and full of authentic Mexican flavors. The charred cauliflower was delicious and flavorful as well! I had a skinny margarita while small these suckers are mighty! They also had a vegan tamale a tofu and sweet potato tacos. Ill review them next time!"}
{"text":"Arizona Iced Tea, check. Fresh tortilla chips, check. Black bean and a salsa dip, check check.  I had a great business lunch at this airy, friendly Mexican restaurant.   The staff was welcoming and friendly.   They went out of their way to explain the menu and specials when they learned we were first timers.  The guacamole appetizer was freshly made and well seasoned.   My duck confit taco was rich and flavorful.  Yes!  Duck confit in a taco.  Crazy good.  Great ambiance.  I'll definitely visit again when in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Went to SOL last night for dinner with a girlfriend and luckily they were having Taco Tuesday, so excellent prices on tacos and margaritas. I have been wanting to try this place for awhile and was pleasantly suprised! First of all, GREAT LOCATION. Easy parking in the garage next door. We were warmly greeted and they even allowed us to move tables to the outside patio no problem. The manager came over and chatted with us for a bit, giving us a brief history on the restaurant. He was very nice and checked in with us later on in the evening. I appreciated that. Our server was fast and friendly. My friend and I shared each kind of taco on the menu including carnitas, grilled fish and chicken. So yummy! The tortilla chips and salsa they brought out before our tacos were also tasty. We really loved the live music and had a nice time. Will definetly be back!"}
{"text":"We have been looking for a new Mexican Restaurant in town that was exceptional. The emphasis on Baja style Mexican was a pleasant surprise. We have no complaints about the food or service. Everyone was very attentive and willing to explain the items on the menu. The shrimp was delicious. We had burritos that we ordered wet and they were huge. My husband had a half left to take home. Desert was outstanding and I did not think I had room, but I did, and loved the chocolate with banana bread pudding.  Supper  Margarittas! Many to choose from. Will definitely return! Best find in years! By the way, Thank you USAir for choosing this restaurant to review. We may not have found this on our own."}
{"text":"We went to SOL for the first time this week for lunch. The interior ambiance is beautiful & the patio is fabulous. Since it wasn't scorching out, we opted for the patio.   For starters, we ordered chips & guac. Very good, but could have used more chips on the upfront, as we needed about 3 baskets in order to finish the guac since only about 5-6 chips fit in a basket. Hungry people problems maybe?  For my entree, I ordered the beer-battered fish tacos with a side of rice. Ryan ordered a pork burrito with a side of rice as well. The tacos were great with a delicious cabbage slaw. Ryan's burrito resembled an episode of Man vs. Food.   -1 star for service. I think being on the patio made our table forgettable.   Didn't take advantage of the Yelp check-in deal as I wasn't having a boozy lunch. However, I'm sure I'll be back to use it!"}
{"text":"Wish I could do negative stars. Management doesn't know how to run a business nor treat his customer's respectfully. We got yelled out for letting him know we've been waiting for over two hours when we were told 40 mins and then 40 mins later was told 15 mins. Over an hour later we finally complained and got an attitude from management. 25% of the tables we're empty. Stay away."}
{"text":"I feel like this place deserves 2 stars  and my wife feels like it doesn't deserve any stars...we split steak calamari..I thought it was okay and my wife didn't care for it at all..the sauce was decent.  For entree, I ordered carne asada burrito and it barely had any steak OR FLAVOR and my wife ordered street tacos and she only had a couple bites...I later found out that she didnt eat it because the meat was raw/red..I am a real fast eater and usually not that picky so at this point my food was 80 percent done because I was so hungry and didnt care at this point. When she pointed out that the meat was raw..I observed my dish and noticed it was raw as well..the server knew that my wife didnt care for the food and he didnt do anything about it..he was really nice though but oh well..I am kinda buzzing right now while writing this review because we had drinks at Narcise afterwords..I should have known not to go to SOL because my wife's boss mentioned it was ehhh !  The food was missing seasoning...no flavor!  Later, we went to Menchie's for yogurt and the owner told us that someone she knew got sick from there..we are not sick yet..we will keep our fingers crossed......our bill was 51.09 and I still gave the water 10.00 tip..I feel like its not his fault!"}
{"text":"Quick edit: thanks to manager Dave for looking to right this wrong with an apology and offer to chat about ways to improve the experience next time. I haven't returned but the attention to fixing is appreciated.   Yelp steered me wrong this time. This place was pretty mediocre. The atmosphere was great but the food was disappointing given then reviews and price.   First, the chips are actually tortillas which a thick dash of what tastes like paprika. Not great and salsa was thin and just boring.  I got the \"el Jefe\" filet and shrimp taco and was really disappointed. The meat was very chewy and just thrown on with two small shrimp. A real letdown, especially given the price. My other item was the fish taco gobernador. I asked for items with no dairy and while the cheese was removed, the taco had a slew of Creme sauce on it hidden by lots of lettuce and a little piece of fish.  Finally, my waiter was barely around. We didn't get silverware until someone got up to ask after asking when our meals were delivered and we had to find someone again to ask for the check once we were finished.  Needless to say, despite just one visit and taste testing a few items, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Stopped by yesterday for \"Cinco De Mayo\" I'm new to AZ from Detroit my BDay is May 7th so I REALLY celebrate the holiday even though I'm not Mexican.  Sat @ the bar - nice atmosphere. I was a little disappointed because it was not \"festive.\" 1st. Ordered the drink special- some type of Watermelon Margarita. They muddle the watermelon (I luv muddled fruit in my drinks) strain and... where's my fruit? I had to ask for my fruit.  2nd. Ordered the Guacamole - it was spicy but seem like something was missing ??? 3. I came for a Chimichanga \"No\" Chimichanga's. I reviewed their menu beforehand  & they list a \"fried\" Burrito so my friend said maybe that's it- nope!  We ended up \"leaving\" I wanted more of a \"party, sombreros and beads\" atmosphere & my Chimichanga.  So 3 stars for me. Would I come back? Yes BUT not during \"Cinco De Mayo\""}
{"text":"Good food, great drinks and talented live music on Taco Tuesday's!"}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican food. All their food has a very special twist to it. It was our first time here and we absolutely loved it. Definitely a nice place to go on a date. Recommend it to anyone around the area."}
{"text":"Solid upscale, inventive Mexican fare in a full-service setting. Complimentary chips and salsas were terrific (one traditional, one looked/tasted like black bean & pepitas). The guac app and elote were also solid. I had the grilled quail - very tasty and fun. Wifey and dining companions enjoyed their fish, veggie tacos and margaritas. Props for having a craft brew (Lagunitas IPA) available. Service was very friendly and reasonably prompt. Only downside was that our meals were brought out about 5 minutes after we ordered. Weird -- made it seem like things were all pre-prepped and/or we were being pushed to turn the table."}
{"text":"Wow flavors that burst with every bite! Starters where corn elote and warm goat cheese with peanuts. Fish taco shrimp taco. Viper taco with goat cheese made my hubby's eyes water.  The vegetarian in the group had the sweet potato taco. Must go!"}
{"text":"Two words: KOBE STEAK.  Two servers: RODRIGO OR MIKE M  One drink: CLASE AZUL MARGARITA  Order these, get served by one of them, and let your amazing experience begin."}
{"text":"I been to this restaurant twice and both time where amazing. First time was just with my mom had an amazing Margarita but wasn't a big fan of the shrimp tacos but the vampero  tacos was excellent. The second time it was a group of 8 people it was so easy to call for a reservation  for 6:30pm and got to sit right when we walked in the door at 6:20 . Also the fish tacos where amazing, are server recommend it and I'm not a huge fish fan in Arizona but it was amazing tasted so fresh it reminded me of the fish I had in Florida."}
{"text":"I give it two stars for two reasons: great service and good sangria. The food was less than mediocre. I ordered carne asada tacos with black beans and quinoa salad. The black beans were really runny and they soaked the corn tortillas of the tacos and made them soggy. The carne asada lacked flavor. I love good Mexican food, this was not it. It was also very pricey for disappointing food."}
{"text":"North-central Scottsdale, near the Apple Store. Disappointed- got the impression it is barely making the rent and/or mismanaged. Was seated next to the ladies bathroom, even tho the place was mostly empty. Asked to relocate outside, before even sitting, and the hostess got huffy! The waiter was efficient but \"in your face\", made a show of himself, bragged how the food is much better than other Mexican restaurants and tried too hard to upsell whatever he could. No lunch menu- it's dinner 24/7 here. $15 burrito that was in no way created by an award winning chef- an embarrassment in creativity & value compared to Chipotle, right across the street. The waiter tried to upsell it to a $19 version by adding enchilada sauce. (?!?) Wife had a $14 shrimp salad that was unremarkable. Both of our stomachs were unsettled soon afterward. The street is very loud, with noisy cars and motorcycles constantly racing past, interrupting conversation. The bar appeared spacious and comfortable- that would be the only reason we might return- for one drink while shopping- but there are so many good other choices nearby in the Quarter or across Scottsdale Road in Phoenix-Kierland."}
{"text":"We love the street tacos.  We picked 3 different street tacos.  Pork, steak and chicken.  They all 3 are so good!  We love their bean dip.  It taste so darn good.  It mixed with homemade salsa."}
{"text":"I had a nice evening here with friends. We each order different items and everyone seemed to enjoy their meals. I ordered the shrimp chile relleno. It had a really good flavor but it was more rice than anything. The chile was not too spicy and a nice size. I would rate this as average because I did not send it back but would not order it again.  On the other hand, the shrimp bacon guacomole was adsolutely delish!"}
{"text":"Great lunch! Israel was the perfect server. Loved the chips and salsa and my chopped salad with shrimp was perfect!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ate here today, staff and service were great. The manager greeted us and sat us, very helpful as we brought our 1 year old. Food was decent- guac special was very bland even after putting salt and hot sauce in it. The carne asada taco was delish! The other tacos my hubs and I had were so so. I still prefer the mission."}
{"text":"I think this is the last place to close the bar in the Scottsdale Quarter area - and that's still only at 10pm. That's how we ended up here - they were still open during our appetizer crawl through the Quarter. We enjoyed the place and the bartender enough to try brunch here the next day. It's tons of food, for a fair price. I didn't care for their bloody. I enjoyed what I got, but I'm not sure I'll return for the brunch. Maybe for a Mexican dinner one night though!"}
{"text":"carnitas quesadilla was great so was the grilled shrimp taco. Our server, BETO, didn't write down our order so he forgot the beer battered taco. They arrived after we were done with our other food. Bloody Mary was not GOOD, watered down. MAKE SURE TO REQUEST ANY SERVER EXCEPT BETO. No refills, he didn't seem to really care that we were there. We sat for 20 minutes waiting for our check while he sat on his chair talking with his friends. Never cleared our plates."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Stop by Sol at least once a week and sit at the bar. Katie B and Devin are great as bartenders and are very prompt and attentive to anything that we need.  The food along with chips and salsa are good and consistent. Nice atmosphere with the outdoor seating of tables and bar. Highly recommend -"}
{"text":"I seriously love this place!  Amazing margarita's and guacamole.  Great vegetarian options available.  Will definitely recommend in the future!"}
{"text":"Service sucked! We had a reservation for 6pm and arrived 5 minutes early. We were seated 10 minutes late with two other walk-ins being seated prior. Once seated we immediately ordered drinks and never received them. After a 30 min wait we up and left."}
{"text":"The bartender Stacey was full of life and very helpful. Drinks were great...especially the frozen margaritas.  Weren't accomodating to customizing dinner choices. I would run back for drinks...not so much for the food"}
{"text":"Vampiro specialty taco is FANTASTIC and plenty for one person with rice and beans. Specialty fish taco is equally great. Street tacos are outstanding with excellent meat, corn tortillas, and condiments. If you want a margarita, make sure you order \"grande\" which is in a pint glass with lots of ice. Next time I go there I'll ask them to use half the amount of ice as it's really too much.  Regardless, I'm really glad we came here for lunch!"}
{"text":"We fell inlove with this place.  We came  for our 50th month anniversary and found it on yelp.  From the chips , black bean dip and salsa all the way to the dessert we were very very happy.  Thinking about coming back on a Thursday night they do a tequila tasting. This place will make you fall in love tequila!  Rodrigo was a wonderful server, but your in luck his brothers also work here and they know their food!  Can't wait to come back and being friends"}
{"text":"Outstanding service, food and drinks.  Always a great experience here.  Frozen margaritas are delicious!"}
{"text":"Pricy, more \"authentic\" than some of the larger chain Mexican restaurants, but still kind of a trendy twist on Mexican.   Atmosphere is a little more upscale than a typical Mexican joint, and the service was spot on. The food didn't wow me, but the quality was there. I could tell they were using quality ingredients, they just lacked in execution. I remember thinking that the menu reads a lot more exciting than the dishes ended up being in real life.   Solid entry into the high end Mexican category. They make a dang good michelada too, so if that's your thing, make sure you try one. Be prepared to spend more than you probably expect."}
{"text":"Well this place is awful... I have come here before on multiple occasions and enjoyed my food and experience but today it was just awful. Let me start by saying that my server was awesome he was always attentive and knowledgeable about the menu and the service from him was amazing... That is about the only thing amazing about this place. I came here with my girlfriend after doing some shopping at the stores in Scottsdale quarter; and we were both hungry and ordered the following: the coconut calamari and the guacamole with goat cheese as an appetizer. I tried both but since I'm not a goat cheese fan I didn't eat much of the guacamole.   We also ordered a couple of drinks which were quite good... And then we ordered the main course which included 4 tacos, specifically the shrimp, fish, short rib, and vampiro... These tasted ok at the time but after 2-3 hours both me and my girlfriend are sitting in our hotel taking turns in the bathroom...   I want to call this place sh*t out of luck because that is what SOL will stand for once you eat here and get sick. Like seriously I am trying to figure out in between trips to the bathroom which item caused us to both get sick and the only 3 items that we both ate were the the guacamole, the shrimp taco and the coconut calamari. So again I would recommend staying away from these 3 items and this place as a whole unless you want to be in the bathroom for a whole day.  Again SOL Mexican Cantina stands for Sh*t out of Luck and that's where you will be if you eat here."}
{"text":"SOL Mexican Cocina is a beautiful restaurant. The watermelon margarita was sweet and amazing! We ordered the Naked Guacamole and Grilled Sweet Corn for the table. It was average. The battered shrimp taco I ordered was delicious though, but for $6.50 for one taco, I thought the price was a little high. Overall, service was good, food was above average, and atmosphere was great, so I will be back soon."}
{"text":"I have lived in Scottsdale for more than 20 years, but I first became acquainted with SOL while visiting relatives in Newport Beach, CA. Much to my surprise, SOL was opened in the upscale shopping center--Scottsdale Quarter--just minutes from my home. What a find and nice surprise.  Not a traditional Mexican Restaurant but a vibrant establishment which serves a variety of food with Mexican food as its base. We had the steak and shrimp combination and the duck as our two entrees along with excellent guacamole and chips. All three menu items were recommended by our excellent sever, Tracy.  She been at SOL since opening day--two years ago--and knows the menu inside and out. So, for service, food and ambiance we couldn't have had a better experience. By the way, the quantity of food allowed us to take home some of each plate for an excellent at home dinner the next evening."}
{"text":"SOL is one of our favorite casual restaurants in the Scottsdale Quarter shopping area.  It's located on the North end of the Quarter, so I recommend parking in the North Garage.    They're known for their Tacos...and they deliver the goods!  Some of the menu items I've had here are:  Naked Guacamole (Hass Avocado, Cilantro, Lime, Onion, Serrano, Tomato), $8.75  Chorizo and Mushrooms con Queso (Chorizo, Mushrooms, 3 Mexican Cheeses, Serrano & Scallions), $12.50  Street Taco Flight (2 each Carne Asada, Carnitas, Chicken Tacos), $18  Vampiro Taco (Cheese, Serrano Chile, Scallions,  Carne Asada, Guacamole, Pico, Chipotle Sauce, Cotixa Cheese), $6.75  Taco Buffalada (Chicken, Carne Asada, Carnitas, Cheese, Onion, Guacamole, Pico, Radish), $6.50  3 Carne Asada Tacos, $14.50  3 Carnitas Tacos, $13.00  My favorite out of all of the Tacos is the Vampiro Taco.  It's full of flavor and has a unique taste to it.  The Buffalada Taco is a close second....although I think mixing all of those Meats together on one Taco is a bit much.  Their traditional street Tacos (Carne Asada/Carnitas) are very good, but I prefer eating those from a hole in the wall Mexican restaurant.  Their appetizers are very good too.  The Naked Guacamole is amazing, so is the Chorizo and Mushrooms con Queso.  Those two can fill you up though, so don't order too much food if you decide to go with one of those apps.  The service here is so/so.  When it gets busy, the attentiveness of the servers declines....and this place gets very busy, especially at dinner time and happy hour.  Whenever it's busy, we have to wave down our servers to keep our glasses full, order more Wine, etc.  The vibe here is pretty cool too.  When the weather is great, the patio is a nice place to be.  However, when it gets hot and the misters turn on, it can be a bit too much.  The misters on the patio pump out a lot of water....too much in my opinion.  It's kind of funny because it looks like a tropical rainforest when they turn on the misters in the middle of the Summer heat....there's a massive \"fog\" and it can get you a bit soaked.  I joked about it with a bartender one night and he said that the misters are controlled by the shopping mall and not by the individual businesses, so they have no control over it.  Oh well, it makes for great people watching.  Return Factor - 95%"}
{"text":"My wife and I are die hard mexican food fans and have been anxiously awaiting the opening of Sol Mexican Cocina.  We love the Quarter and are happy to see new food concepts of this caliber opening.    The service was outstanding.  We were greeted warmly and taken to our table.  Home made chips and a trio of salsas were promptly brought to our table as well as water.  This team didn't miss a beat.  Jackie and I are vegetarians and we often find our options limited when eating at most mexican restaurants.  This was not the case @ Sol!  They have a great vegetarian and even vegan menu options.  Try the sweet potato tacos or the empanadas!    http://www.solcocina.com/scwp/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/sol_sc_menu_vegan.pdf  We will definitely be going back!  Care to join us?  Have fun guys!  dtap"}
{"text":"Our waiter was un-attentive. The margaritas were excellent but the food was bland. I ordered a carne asada burrito and wife ordered a carnitas burrito both were very mediocre. I will not be making my way back."}
{"text":"Still... really enjoy coming to SOL.  YELPERS- check in and SOL givez you a check in offer.  Salute!  Man, their margarita's are so delicious their bartenders really listen to you if you request a special order.  The street tacos are still fabulous.  It's too bad we live so far we can't frequent more ...but when we are in the area...we make this a stop."}
{"text":"Love this place the food is delicious & the service & atmosphere are excellent. If we are ever in Scottsdale we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place held true to its ratings. My husband loves spicey food so he tried the Viper taco, good flavor plenty hot!and the chile verde which was VeRY good!! We make our own, are tough critics and this was fabulous! I had the Kobe a skirt Steak with chimichurri perfectly cooked! This was a great taste of Sottsdale!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here last night for a snack and a couple of drinks. I cannot wait to come back because the food was awesome. We sat at the outdoor portion of the bar top and had a great time. I had a Frozen Beer (frozen margarita with beer of your choice) my husband had a Victoria.  Then we opted to share a Carnitas Quesadilla. It was HUGE and it came with 2 sides!! I don't know how anyone could eat a whole one. We even had two slices left over that we brought home. The chips and salsa were also very good. The reason for the 3 stars is because the bartenders weren't overly friendly. They were definitely nice and took care of us, but one thing that's great about sitting at a bar is the interaction with the bartenders. Other than taking our orders, and checking in once the food came, they really didn't seem to care if we were there or not. And... they only had one TV working, we were watching the Cubs/Dodgers playoff game and then suddenly they change it to college football for some guy who came in well after we did. Oh well, such is life! We'll be back for sure, just won't be looking to make friends hahaha."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday deals are delicious!  Naked guac, carnitas tacos, I added a side of quinoa and sweet corn too.  Plenty of options for all types of eaters and can adjust spice on everything.  Prices are very reasonable and service was outstanding!"}
{"text":"Perusing the menu of this upscale Mexican restaurant in the Scottsdale Quarter I was initially impressed by the variety and selection of ingredients. I was then highly amused when I read the description around the ceviche indicating it was made with fresh sashimi grade \"local fish\". We live in the desert. A big one. If they are using fresh \"local\" fish it would have to be from Tempe Town Lake or the Arizona Canal. And I dunno about you, but I ain't eating that - cooked even. I did find out later the company originates out of California and it appears they just reprinted the menus and/or got a bulk deal and didn't update it for the Scottsdale location. Detail oriented.   The menu does offer lots of hearty brunch options and a wide variety of 'specialty' tacos. The waitress initially brought out some large corn chip type things, dusted with paprika and several accoutrements. I don't eat corn, but tried a couple of the items that came along with the chips (because for some reason she really talked this stuff up, like as in one of those awkward \"why is my waitress still talking\" kind of talked it up. There was nothing worth having talked my ear off about. Anyway, when she stopped talking, she walked away, without taking a drink order. When I did finally see her again, I ordered a mimosa, which showed up quite some time later. The bar was dead and the restaurant wasn't that full, so I am not really sure what could take so long about putting orange juice and bubbly wine in a glass. I can forgive a lot if someone keeps my cocktail full; this continued to be a challenge throughout lunch.   When the gal came back to ask for our orders and whether we had questions, I had two. One, are the tacos all on corn, or can they be made on flour; and, which items on the menu have a little bit of a kick or heat to them. The first question was responded to with, \"No. Traditionally Mexican tacos are made on corn tortillas,\" which was put to me in the same tone of voice my mother uses when she can't believe what just came out of my mouth.   BEGIN RANT:   \"Traditionally\" not ALL tacos are made on corn tortillas. In Oaxaca, in Central Mexico, yes, but in Sonora or down the Baja the locals very often utilize flour tortillas. This place professes to be all about Baja style food and in all my times up and down in the region I have actually never had one Mexican, in a restaurant, in a road side stand or otherwise, tell me they couldn't make whatever I asked for on a flour tortilla. Anyway, a simple \"No, I'm sorry, we don't use flour tortillas,\" or \"No. But let me suggest...\" would have sufficed, rather than providing me with a snotty response as to why this \"authentic Mexican cantina\" located in one of the most affluent shopping centers in all of Scottsdale, without one non-white person to be seen, can't be bothered with catering to the masses. I am pretty sure 98% of my annoyance here was in the delivery. If you don't like being nice to people, you probably shouldn't be working for tips.   END RANT.  My next question, as to whether any items on the menu had green chiles or any heat behind them and the waitress pointed out a taco (see above) I had already indicated I wasn't interested in and then reminded me about the weak sauce on the table that had come out with the much hyped corn ships. I asked her again later if they had anything hotter (yes I am one of those people) and she mumbled something and pointed to this stuff on the table AND WALKED AWAY, again without offering another option or suggestion.  I gave up on the Mexican food and ordered a crab cakes benedict off the brunch menu. The good news here is that the crab cakes were amazing, and the eggs cooked perfectly. And you know, authentic Mexican restaurants are known for their crab cakes benedict. They pair this (I guess to Mexican it up) with refried black beans, but they made absolutely no sense with the dish as a whole, and weren't very flavorful. I left them on the plate virtually untouched, along with the (very Mexican) fried bacon laid on top of them. My lunch date ordered a couple of the $7-8 individual tacos. He was happy and they had good flavor and nice elements. So that's all swell. I just don't get the price. I have no problem with expense, if the purchase is worth it. I think my breakfast was $18, but for crab cakes benedict, which is on par with what I would expect.   I realize most of this review has to do with service, but overall our waitress was not only unprofessional and not helpful, but she was kind of rude. Maybe she should spend a little time working in an actual \"authentic\" Mexican cantina, where they would expect that she provide better customer service for a $1 taco than we received here for a $60 lunch."}
{"text":"Great drinks! I really like their selection which ranges from house margaritas to fruit infused tequila drinks to micheladas!   Came here for a birthday dinner. When I saw the menu, I thought to myself. \"Hmm this is stuff you can get for under 5 dollars at a Mexican restaurant in So-Cal, but it's they make it look fancy and price at $14!\"  The food was good and I do like their free chips and salsa (two different kinds), but it was just way too overpriced for what seemed to me like scaled up Mexican street food. But I guess it definitely caters well to some. It is in Scottsdale afterall.   The service was pretty good considering it was a very busy Saturday night. The waitress was nice and made some good recommendations throughout the night. Can't complain about their service and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Creative takes on classics that don't fall short in flavor or portion. Mango margarita was a great closer to a fantastic dining experience."}
{"text":"We love taco Tuesday here! Alberto was so friendly and attentive, recommended great drinks food and dessert too. Fish batter tacos and shrimp cocktel is delish, and I always look forward to the table chips and salsa w/ warm bean dip."}
{"text":"Calamari strips with toasted coconut was the best ever!!!! Don't miss this place!!!  Skinny margaritas were wonderful!  We'll be back...."}
{"text":"This is a nice place in the heart of Scottsdale; with great decor and nice ambience. I had made a reservation and when we arrived we did not like the spot allocated to us; we asked for a different spot and they willingly moved us to where we liked to be seated though it was a very busy night; our server had great recommendations for both food and drink; the food came out so quick, was tasting perfect; Margaritas that we got were awesome; will definitely recommend; you will need to reserve in advance as this place is fully packed most of the times."}
{"text":"Great service, but very crowded. Took us about 1-1.5 hours despite being fast eaters. The shrimp taquitos and hot and spicy ceviche were amazing!!!  There was also live music which was good too. Great decor, just a bit loud for talking."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best Southwestern food I've ever tried.  Order a couple of tacos, a margarita, and chill in their hip environment.  The best part is this restaurant is really affordable!"}
{"text":"They have some unusual food here.  I ordered a duck taco.  It was delicious.  The meat fell off the bone yet crispy on the outside.  However the portion is very small.  This goes for all of the plates.  One duck leg, 3 small corn tortillas, 3 slices of avocado.  The best part is the dessert.  We ordered the dark chocolate bread pudding and blonde brownie.  Awesome sin food."}
{"text":"Well, if you want top notch Mexican... this is the place but $$? not quite let's go with $$$. Worth it! Great atmosphere too."}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about, will not go back. Overpriced, and the food wasn't good. I didn't even like their chips and salsa. I got goat cheese enchiladas and i LOVE goat cheese but they didn't taste fresh. Husband got a $16 burrito that he didn't have anything WOW to say about. So anyway, it's good but not great. Meh."}
{"text":"Just ate here for the first time while in town for work. Our server Alberto was great as was the food. Highly recommended spot! Great atmosphere too!"}
{"text":"I'll be honest. My husband liked it. But me personally. I didn't. Everything had a burned taste. I know myself and even if he wanted to come back... I won't! Lol"}
{"text":"Hey yelpers! How the heck Did this place get an average of four stars..... Our experience on 2/13/16 certainly wasn't anywhere close-even my two star rating is GENEROUS.  In our reservation we asked for a quiet booth (it seems that many restaurants think it is trendy to be loud). The hostess didn't have one but said she'd seat us in a \"quiet corner\".  Her definition and mine certainly aren't in alignment because to my right was a table of 12 (including 4 kids running around), behind me a table with a crying baby and two more tables with little kids completed the circle. Don't misunderstand, I'm not anti-kid but being surrounded by young restless families does not qualify as a \"quiet corner.\"  Next the food: we ordered two of their specialty margaritas and they tasted like the supermarket margarita mix over ice. Not at all what we were expecting. We ordered the acclaimed goat cheese appetizer (basically a scoop of low end cheese with a handful of peanuts on top)-VERY AVERAGE.  At this point we decided to cut our losses and try to salvage the night some place else.  After all why make a bad evening worse. I asked to speak with the manager, and he came to our table, just to give him a little feedback on our experience. That was also a bit disappointing. In most cases I've experienced, the manager tries to make some accommodation in a situation like this one. Instead he just made excuses for the average food and poorly trained staff.   DISAPPOINTING ALL AROUND.  I cannot recommend this restaurant, unless you are a family with small kids OR want to eat at the Mexican equivalent of Chuckee Cheese."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like it here.  Great location.  Beautiful restaurant.  Delicious looking menu.  The food was very good but not enough to get me to got back. I'm fine with there being a wait when I go out to eat. However, this place is not designed well at all for customers that have to wait. There are no seats at the entrance, no benches outside.  The restaurant is CRAMMED with tables so standing at the bar while you wait is uncomfortable for those trying to find space to stand, let alone those sitting down trying to enjoy their meal. Our waiter was sub-par.  When he finally came to our table, he immediately asked if we were ready to order.  Had to ask another waiter for water, and by the time my margarita was served (only because I had to ask a busser if he could check the bar to see if my drink was up there), the ice was melted. Our waiter never checked on us once our food was served. Overall, good food, terrible layout, poor service."}
{"text":"Great service at Sol! Alberto had amazing recommendations and the service was amazing. Must try the Street corn and sol guacamole, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, food was REALLY good (we all shared) shrimp chile relleno - amazing , goat cheese enchiladas add carnitas - phenomenal, and we started with the chorizo queso - delicious ."}
{"text":"Food is freaking delicious. Had the skinny margarita and it may be the best margarita I've ever had. Service is decent. I recommend going for happy hour, and taco Tuesday. That's the only time it's really affordable."}
{"text":"Coconut calamari was different from any calamari I've ever had, and quite yummy. So were the Vampire Taco and the Fish Taco Gobernador. Two of us shared all three dishes and were quite satisfied."}
{"text":"Our dinner at SOL was exceptional and the service charming! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Love the drinks but the food and service are hit and miss.  It's a great location to meet friends but not the best for the price."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with my 6-year old daughter. The food was delicious, the price was right, and the service was really quite outstanding. I especially appreciated the way several of the staff went out of their way to be kind to my daughter. We had just had an awful experience at Kona Grill around the corner from this place (we left before eating because the service was so awful), so we were especially pleased at how terrific everything turned out when we went here. Thank you :)"}
{"text":"We had corn and Spanish octopus as appetizers. Both were excellent. I am not a big fan of corn but I really liked the corn at SOL Mexican Cocina. It was best corn ever! Main dish was delicious and very good. Our server Alberto did a great job taking care of us. I am a very picky eater but I am giving five stars to this place. They deserved it!"}
{"text":"Wow this place was AMAZING! We went on cinco de mayo there was no wait and the hostess was super nice! Our seats were comfortable and the environment was very inviting. Everyone seemed to be busy but not moving so fast that where knocking each other down. They had an excellent take on chips and dip! Our waitress was so wonderful she took our order for everything right and was not bothersome like usual waiters are, we didn't even have to wait or ask for a drink refill she brought one right one time with the food! This place is magnificent!!! My boyfriend and I caught our selves in silences just enjoying the food that was absolutely delicious and fresh the rice and sides were to die for! To end the night i want to take half of my food to go; the waitress took the plate to the back for booking while adding an additional aide of salsa!"}
{"text":"Why haven't I been here sooner?!?! My aunt was visiting from out of state and we decided to do lunch I told her there was a cool looking Mexican joint in the quarter that I hadn't tried yet so we decided to give it a shot. Very nice decor and ambience...very \"old world modern\". Our server was very nice and explained everything to us since it was our first time. I got the blackberry ginger marg...delishh :) we got coconut calamari for the app and each got tacos. My aunt was super pleased and I found my new Mexican spot...even though I wanna go back mainly for the calamari!"}
{"text":"Okay I think SOL's rating is completely skewed. As a 22 year old Arizona native, SOL is the best combination of delicious Mexican food and a modern, fun atmosphere in the valley. Comparable to Blanco, the menu is more original but more expensive as well. Their margaritas are to die for, I've tried nearly every flavor.  I hate cocktails that taste flavored with syrup or too much sugar, but SOL's flavored margaritas taste fresh and natural. As far as a food goes, I usually fill up on their unique tostada/bean dip/salsa (as opposed to traditional chips and salsa) and margaritas, I only have one or two street tacos. Filling and I end up not spending a ton as well.  SOL is one of my favorite spots in Scottsdale, it's definitely somewhere to check out!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I really enjoy this place! It's a California Mexican menu and they do fun versions of guacamole that change periodically. Ive had the chicken tacos and the sweet potato tacos and they were both great! My fiancé really liked his duck tacos as well. This place has a cool atmosphere and the margaritas are pretty yummy too!"}
{"text":"Overall pretty good. Service was really slow, but they were fairly busy. Shrimp tacos (any of them) are the way to go."}
{"text":"this Mexican restaurant is simply fantastic. When you arrive, make sure to order one of their signature cocktails. The jalapeno cucumber is a great one to start with. Their street tacos are filling and portions are large. My favorite is the carnitas taco. For dessert, their flan is really, really good and flavorful, but don't expect authenticity.  It's thicker than traditional flan, but I found it a welcome change.  The service is efficient, quick and friendly. I will definitely come back again and again!"}
{"text":"Best calemary ,, best location, best Mexico food, oh my gosh I ordered pineapple and coconut juice it was so good every one should try it for one time, i am sure you will like it"}
{"text":"Whoa. Pretty blown away by my experience here. To be honest I really didn't know what I was going to do for a week in Phoenix. I was hoping to visit some hole in the wall Mexican places, drink some mezcal, and have some fun. Unfortunately I ended up in a pretty ritzy hotel in an area with no holes in the wall. I was not very hopeful for being able to get a great experience without taking a taxi across town, but I was pointed the direction of this restaurant when I asked where I could find mezcal. They have 2 kinds to try. Aged in oak and not aged in oak. Both were good, but I would go for the not aged I think. We started with some seviche with beet and sweet potato chips. It was pretty good and a big hit around the table. I thought it was about normal except for the chips which were a nice touch. As for the meal, I got a few different tacos which were all good, but the vampiro taco was absolutely out of this world. I mean like buckle your knees nothing else matters in the world good. Tender, juicy meat and a mixture of wonderfully different, yet familiar flavors. I've been thinking of them every day since I had them. My friend had some cheese thing with chorizo I think that you put in tortillas which were great too. We all had margaritas  as well and they were great. They're not made with some cheap mix and served in some martini glass, but a classic, good quality margarita that you just want to drink all night. The staff was very good too. Nothing that sticks out really, but attentive and accurate and friendly. Also, just have a mention that any menu that mentions epazote multiple times is a hint to a great experience to come! Thanks so much for giving such a great experience on my trip!"}
{"text":"A little pricey for a burrito and really price tacos. My wife bought 1 taco for $10+ which is okay if it is amazing but for a little above average that's not good value."}
{"text":"Had a business meeting here with colleagues from out of town. Great food and service. Was a hit with everyone"}
{"text":"We always have a great time at this restaurant. We love the smell of the open kitchen brings to the restaurant. The food is flavorful and nicely presented. We usually dine at the \"indoor/outdoor\" bar where we receive attentive service. How can you beat a Newport Beach based restaurant located in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"SOL has become our \"go to\" choice for Mexican food for special occasions and special friends.  Excellent portion size that does not break the bank.  Service is always friendly and attentive.  I highly recommend SOL for a wonderful meal!"}
{"text":"The food was decent. Slightly pricey for what you get. The service was good. The corn cream crab soup was prettt good. I would come back if whenever we're in this side of town again."}
{"text":"We were early for a meeting with a friend, so we sat at the outside bar. The bartender suggested a Black Ginger Margarita and it was outstanding. She went on her way and the replacement tender  came in. He seemed cocky in his mannerism and shit talking. He made me another one and I couldn't choke it down. What happened? Our friends arrived and we were seated immediately. We had some catching up to do, so we weren't in a hurry. We had two servers that came back 4 times for our dinner order. I think one was in training. I was getting the warm and fuzzy from all the attention. Right! Once we received our meals the cricket sound started. I ordered a Kobe steak as well as my buddy. Be were both taken aback by the size of our meals. We are not categorized as small people and were expecting something a little more our size. Mine was delicious though. As we were eating I noticed that we all had seen the bottom of our glasses and that no one has been back to we if we needed anything. Our friends husband got up and went to the bar to get himself a drink. I wasn't paying attention to the color of his head, but it was red and he was pissed. After we finished our meals the manager walks by and looks directly at me and asks how everything was? As she was talking I was gently pointing across the table to my friend who was clearly ready to snap her in two. He explained the situation. We were courted until we said yes, and then left at the alter. She apologized several times and all of a sudden we had the two tenors gushing all over us. Then he dropped off our check. The manager came back and asked why we didn't order dessert. We weren't asked. She lost it! Then she came back with a menu and insisted on comping our dessert. No one wanted it, and when she put the menu in front of my buddy he finally gave in. This my friends is where it gets good! They bring out the Chocolate bread pudding with whip cream on top. But the problem was. The picture showed a big scoop of vanilla ice cream on top. As it was explained to us. The menu is from their Newport Beach location and they do not have a freezer specifically dedicated to ice cream at this local. Well. That is why my friend ordered it, and then got into another tussle with the manager because you can't show a picture and then get served something else. I fully agree and if that was the case. The server should have said something as well as having an addendum to the menu. This is were the five stars comes in.  All of a sudden, a bowl appears out of nowhere piled high with vanilla scoops! That is exactly what I would have done to take care of the customer and make them happy. For all of those born in the new millennia. That is what you call \"Customer Service\". It's a rare site and should be appreciated when encountered. Cheers to SOL and their understanding of what it takes to turn sour grapes into champagne!"}
{"text":"Great food and wonderful service from Alberto! He was awesome and explained the menu very well to us. We will definitely come back and ask for Alberto."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and good food. Ben was the perfect waiter, attentive but not overbearing. Great recommendations on the specialty tacos ana was patient with my specific requests.  As a lone diner felt comfortable and not ignored which can happen at times."}
{"text":"I think this place has some of the best tacos in town. I highly recommend the vampiro. It's a carne asada taco on steroids. The guac is fantastic and mashed at your table. My fiance and I love Sol's margaritas. I've had the house and ginger blueberry. Both were very good. This place had a very cool vibe, it's stylish but not pretentious. I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Arnoldo is the best server! Come see him! And my coconut calamari was the bomb! My sister got the Michelada drink and loved it! The grilled corn appetizer is amazing!"}
{"text":"Awesome place for being located in Scottsdale...lol Lorena was our waitress and she's awesome. Eric is the manager and he took care of us. Margaritas are awesome and have a good kick! This is our 4th visit and we plan on many more even though we live in Verrado"}
{"text":"Well well...  It's tough to top this place for Mexican cuisine. From the the filet and shrimp to the fish tacos. Even the the chips, bean dip and naked guacamole is amazing. Yumm. The tequila selection is top shelf. I can always find an amazing treat in the repo's to the extra's.  Service is beyond expectations. Suggestions, selections and spectacular delivery!  This is tied for my favorite Mexican restaurant in the U.S."}
{"text":"I've been to Sol a couple times before and the standout items for me have been the Vampiro Taco and the Cucumber Jalapeño Margarita. This time we decided to try their Taco Tuesday. We ordered pretty much one of everything on the Taco Tuesday menu:  Naked Guacamole - very good. But they asked if we wanted more chips since we were out after having eaten them with the salsa and bean dip they bring. Um duh...how else would you like me to eat the guac?? House Margarita - it was good...a little too much sweet and sour mix though. Chicken Street Tacos - bland and dry Carnitas Street Tacos - bland Ensenada Fish Taco - it was supposed to have some sort of sauce on it, which I kept looking for. I've had better. Grilled Fish Taco - my husband had it...he said it was good...idk.  The service was also spotty. We felt like we had to beg for water. There were lots of people working, but it was hard to get anyone's attention. Also, see guac comment above.   This place always seems busy, but I'm just not impressed. I'd go back for a quick Vampiro Taco/Cucumber Jalapeño margarita once in a blue moon, but for the prices they charge here it's just not worth it for a whole meal for me. Sorry, Sol!"}
{"text":"Came here yesterday for an Easter Day Mexican brunch. Great experience overall. The first thing I noticed here was the awesome patio. We didn't sit outside on this visit but it would definitely be a patio I would return to for happy hour to enjoy the nice fountain and a fire pit in the fall and winter.  Rodrigo was our waiter and he was great. Very accommodating and thoroughly explained the menu. They had a Sunday brunch menu (from 10am to 4pm) in addition to the regular menu. After looking over both menus I was having a hard time deciding because of so many great sounding options. I really wanted to try the Chilaquiles with huevos ranchero but ultimately decided on the papas with chipolte crema and chorizo. I also ordered a mimosa ($3 on Sunday brunch special). My fiance ordered a grilled chicken burrito smothered with red sauce and a vampiro taco which consisted of carne asada and chipolte sauce. I absolutely loved my papas (see picture)!! They were cooked perfectly with bacon and chorizo and the chipolte crema is delicious. It is enough food to feed about 4 people so be aware of that. I have leftovers for days which I don't mind. My fiance's chicken burrito was also delicious. The red sauce was very tomato based and tasted great, clearly house made.   There are many other menu items I would love to try here and I will definitely be returning to try more. They do have a taco with the ghost chili which I will give a try in the future. I think I will definitely be returning on a Sunday afternoon again because there are so many things on the brunch menu that I need to sample including shrimp and crab cakes benedict. The service was great and overall we had a great experience. I will be going back!!"}
{"text":"Delicious!  Lunch here with the girls today and it hit the spot!! We had the queso appetizer, butternut squash taco and carnitas street tacos.  Lots of thought put into all the different ingredients and toppings.   Rodrigo was awesome and gave super recommendations.  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This was my favorite place that we ate at during our vacation.  They had a fantastic selection of tequila and the guac was amazing.  Service was top notch as our server was filled with recommendations that were on point.  If I lived in the area I would go once a week."}
{"text":"Tasty drinks! Our waiter was very attentive, personable,and gave great recommendations off of the menu. Food was excellent! Looking forward to returning when I am back in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Great food, service and atmosphere!!! I ate my TJ Grilled Shrimp Caesar salad while watching the Cardinals and listening to live music. Yep, I'd say today was a good day"}
{"text":"Just love the ambiance and liveliness of this place.  Make sure to check this place out on Taco Tuesdays, then order the Carnitas Street Tacos with Naked Guacamole...  Great drinks and live music, so that pretty much covers it."}
{"text":"Nice setting, great crew. Terrific food. A group of 7 women went here for Happy Hour and all agreed it was one of the better places we have been.  We have been attending happy hours monthly for 3 years."}
{"text":"SOL made us want to go on vacation. The food was wonderful, try the elotes or grilled corn....YUM.  Drinks were on point, service was fantastic. Rodrigo was the best server!! We will be back."}
{"text":"After not going here in over a year after the worlds worst experience with the worst server ruining my bday dinner I decided to give it another try and pleasantly surprised! The food, service and staff were amazing! Ask for Arnolodo if you go, he's extremely knowledgable, outgoing and takes pride in Sol!!! I will definitely be returning with family and friends :D    Great happy hour as well!"}
{"text":"Slow service (poured our own water/went to bartender for requirements). Undercooked fatty steak in the tacos that primarily tasted burnt. Rock hard \"chips\" and a weak excuse for salsa. Went with a party of 4 and none of us enjoyed our meals - salads, carne asada tacos and chicken quesadilla."}
{"text":"Nice place but the food is mediocre. Typical chain quality."}
{"text":"Came across this place while walking around scottsdale quarters. I wasnt that hungry so decided to get some guacamole and drinks.  My partner ordered the carne asada tacos and a churro type of dessert that of course I tried. The waitress was friendly and really knew her menu.  I was taken back when we asked what do we need to order to get these grilled onions and chiles that were featured in the menu photos and she said they don't make those and wasn't sure why it was in the menu in the first place, disappointing.  They first bring you the chips with some salsa and a black bean dip and a water glass container . The chips are more like tostadas that you must break apart and dip. I liked both dips even though we were iffy about the bean dip at first we ended up ordering another one.  The guacamole sol definitely had a twist to it with a bit if mango and pumpkin seeds. You must mix it yourself, i felt it was missing a little bit of salt and lemon so added some from the condiments they bring to your table, mind you that second salsa is spicy! I ordered a michelada not knowing it would be huge! It took me along time to finish it. It wasn't the best michelada I've had, it was slightly watered down but I finished it. Now the carne asada tacos they were plain didnt have much of the condiments you would find in typical mexican tacos.  The tortilla was definitely a downer. I wish it was more of a home made tortilla taste rather than the grocery guerrero tortillas.  The atmosphere was great nice and cozy, with some music playing in the background and some plasmas to watch sport.  We were seated in the outside patio covered by an orange tarp so dont mind my photos with the odd lighting.  All and all I would go back and try more of their specials. The grilled corn looks delicious!! Oh and if your looking for a cheap meal you wont find it here."}
{"text":"Just ok. Very good, healthy and natural food but a limited menu. It wasn't that busy during lunch and I got the impression it wasn't that popular. Food is good, but there's nothing about it to make it stand out and it definitely isn't inexpensive"}
{"text":"First time dining here and everything was awesome from the food to the service. Would recommend and return. The ambience here is also awesome."}
{"text":"Understaffed. Good food. But service was not good. Don't think I would come on a Friday night again."}
{"text":"A co-worker had mentioned this place so we decided to check it out. It's pretty close to work, so we have been here both for lunch and dinner. We've tried numerous items off the menu, so I'll highlight what we liked the best.  - Guacamole Sol: avocado, mango, goat cheese, and pepitas. This is delicious but it's really unnecessary. Don't get me wrong - I love guacamole but the extras don't really add to it. I'd be fine with their Naked Guacamole.  - Coconut Calamari: calamari steak with panko-breading and coconut. This is delicious! The calamari is huge and super tender. We've ordered this a few times.  - Spicy Chicken & Bacon Salad: walnuts, avocado, cherry tomatoes... mmm. This salad was delicious! The chicken wasn't too spicy and it was very moist and tender. I'd definitely order this again.  - Taco Vampiro: double tortilla stuffed with melted cheese and carne asada. Yum! Little overboard, honestly, who needs 2 tortillas that are stuffed with cheese? But really good.  - Ensenada Style Fish Tacos: your basic fish tacos. We ordered the red rice with this and the red rice is delicious. It's flavorful - definitely not bland like some restaurant's rice.  - Carnitas Street Tacos: the pork was super moist and tender.   While waiting for your food, they bring out salsa, black bean dip, and chips. All are delicious.   The location is pretty easy to get in and out of - as long as there is parking in the parking structure next door. Once you park, the actual restaurant is really close. We've never had to wait for a table, which is nice. The hostess and waiters are extremely nice and helpful. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Margaritas are great. Ceviche is amazingly fresh. Guacamole is different but good. Wasn't really a fan. Chips and Salsa was good. Tad spicy but that's normal for a Mexican restaurant. Crispy Calamari was amazing. Tacos were greattttt. I could go on and on. Just go and please try a little of everything."}
{"text":"This place is really good.  Also, really expensive.  Great margaritas and great food. Service not too shabby either.  Overall a great time."}
{"text":"Incredible food and great service. Very impressed by the wide variety of unique dishes and the staff was great.  A younger couple of boys were are waiters and very good at explaining the dishes and their personal thoughts on the food. the Shrimp appetizer was incredible. Chips were whole corn tortillas cut in half and served warm. very nice ambiance and decor as well."}
{"text":"In terms of all these modern Mexican mini-chains, Sol falls somewhere in the middle. It sort of just blends in amongst a sea of similarly-styled places and doesn't really offer anything that particularly stands out as special. In some ways, Sol is without a Soul. But whatever.     We've been to this location twice. On both occasions, we ordered a \"flight\" of tacos, which wasn't on the menu. This was more of an accommodation made due to our desire to sample various taco styles. Although I'm not even sure if tacos are their specialty.  Their carne asada is decent, having that smokey flavor that I've always liked. The chicken and carnitas are standard. Rice and beans are different than what most places serve, but I don't consider either to be memorable.  During our second visit, we decided to try their Sol guacamole. I really like the inclusion of goat cheese, as well as the various other additions. It's good, but not particularly great given the ten dollar asking price. And any guac that hits or exceeds the 10 dollar mark should automatically be great.  For dessert, we've ordered their banana-dark chocolate bread pudding, which is very hard to go wrong with. They offer a tres leches and a \"blondie\" that we would most likely try upon returning. Although I seriously doubt their leches is comparable with what we've sampled elsewhere.  Don't go in here expecting an \"authentic\" Mexican experience, as it's more along the lines of a modern/corporate take - with a heavy Baja influence. Not that there's anything wrong with that, I guess. I just don't see anything here worth getting enthusiastic about.  It's worth a try or an occasional visit, but I don't really see it ranking up with some of the other options that can be found deeper in Phoenix."}
{"text":"In a place where strip malls makeup the majority of restaurant (or any other) destinations, it's hard to distinguish between the good and the bad. This place is definitely the former and a really solid find. Our waiter was phenomenal, giving us detailed explanations of anything we asked about the menu. Speaking of which, terrific menu. Very inventive and clearly a tremendous about of care was out into its design. Food is fantastic. Ceviche was some of the best I've had, which is a fete considering we're no where near the ocean. Tacos are also a home run. This is definitely a diamond in the rough around here. Also great for just drinks and apps. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I have been to Sol on more than one occasion and each time I go I REALLY want to love this place... It has a sexy vibe and great drinks but their food and service really in my opinion leaves room to be desired... And lets be honest this place isn't cheap! But I am Huge huge fan of their cocktails, their grande clase azul margarita is amazing, and is enough for two to share and also a fan of their farmers market margarita.   On my most recent trip we started with the Ceviche Sol, which is served with sashimi-grade fish, fresh squeezed lime juice, pico & serrano, sliced avocado and served with their highly addictive fried tostada chips. This dish was the best dish of the night and I really think they do a great job with their ceviches. The flavors were balance and the fish was very fresh. Entree wise I did the Lobster & Shrimp Enchiladas, portion was huge but was SUPER fishy and almost like the lobster and shrimp was about to turn rancid. It really lacked any great flavor and just needed something, and for $24.00 i just felt kinda played. A girlfriend got the crane asada burrito served \"wet\", she said the same too, it needed some spice. Tried to order dessert and they were out of the bread pudding. Our waitress was also no where to be seen.... She dropped the check and disappeared for a good 45 minutes.   If your looking for a great margarita and a quick appetizer Sol is your place, but anything beyond that... There are better options"}
{"text":"Just had happy hour last night at SOL here in Scottsdale. I was a little disappointed, because several reviews raved about the Happy Hour. Yes the chips, salsa, and beans were good. We had the chicken & pork tacos as well. Not as filling as one would hope. The service in the beginning was pretty sluggish. Lots of staff standing around and talking (managers too), but empty waters, chips, and drinks. It was 4:45pm in the afternoon, and maybe they don't ramp up till 5 on the service. Still hungry after the tacos, the bartender recommended another dish, that was a HUGE FLOP. They charged extra for some cheese, bacon, and mushrooms, BUT there was no bacon, 2 mushrooms, and a very small amount of cheese. Just saying the quality was very lacking. It got a bit better as time went on, definitely expected a better experience."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing!  The ambience is great but the food is terrific.  I love the specialty tacos, especially the sweet potato one.  I added chicken to mine and it was the best taco I have ever had.  The chips are homemade and warm.  The guacamole is delicious.  I highly recommend eating at Sol!"}
{"text":"this restaurant has the best appetizers and deserts I have ever had. the chef Pablo is an amazing cook and knows his way around Mexican food. he made the desserts very fancy and unique and beautiful. my favorite dessert is chocolate  bread pudding, it was extraordinary. and the cucaracha shrimp appetizer was just to die for. very glad I came here, no regret."}
{"text":"Nice place, watermelon margarita was excellent.  Carnitas street tacos were great, fish special was excellent.  Sweet potato taco was loved by our vegetarian friend.  Traditional guac was lacking in flavor.  Nice servers.  Drinks were slow from the bar and they weren't crazy busy."}
{"text":"Our 4th visit to the restaurant  Great food, horrible service!! Ordered an appetizer but didn't receive it The server (Amy) wasn't too concerned over the error. Tried to order another rounds of drinks but she disappeared  Finally showed attention to us when it was time to clear the plates and deliver the check."}
{"text":"Came to Sol last Wednesday for the 1st time, and I must say that I was very impressed by it.  First, they give you complimentary chips (more like home baked seasoned tostadas) with fresh salsa and bean dip.  You can tell that the salsa is homemade, so it was a nice start to our meal.  We also had 2 specialty tacos (which were delicious) and the pork carnitas.  Let me tell you, the carnitas were out of this world good!  Slow roasted and oh so flavorful....I was seriously considering taking whatever man or woman made them home with me so I could have more at my disclosure!  But the main star of the night was definitely the service.  Our server, Sarah, was absolutely sensational!!  You could tell that she was busy (it was pretty packed in there), however she took the time to explain and recommend the dishes, and even gave us a brief tequila class.  I have never had a server that was so passionate about tequila before!  It made me really want to learn more about the pairings , process etc that tequila can provide, so I definitely plan to come back in order to delve into this some more. :)  Overall, good food and outstanding service!!  Can't wait to go back to enjoy the food and learn more about tequila!!"}
{"text":"Food poisoning. Do I even have to write more? Ordered take out on Memorial Day and saw the fried duck leg taco which sounded unique and different, along with one other taco. Woke up at about 3am sick to my stomach and got ill about 12-15 times. Needless to say I won't be back.   Not to mention extremely overpriced at $8-10 for one taco  à la carte."}
{"text":"I think the carnitas were amazing but the chips could be a little bit better. The service was sub-par.... We got here around 9:30pm and didn't see a server until almost 20 minutes later. He did give us house margs for $5 though!! We will be back ;)"}
{"text":"Great Mexican joint in Scottsdale commons. Nice area to walk around and for shopping as well. Have iPic and the Apple Store there as well. Restaurant is modern and  has a bar. Drinks are awesome. If you check in w yelp you get a 5 dollar margarita drink coupon. Their street tacos are really good esp carne asada. I tried to order the wild fish but they were out of it.  Staff are friendly and helpful. Went with my twin boys and they were extremely accommodating. Would also recommend for a date night or happy hour.  Great place for lunch. Came here on a Wednesday afternoon. We were seated right away. I got the garlic chicken torta which was excellent. If you like spicy get the ghost pepper Salasa. Our waiter Alberto was amazing and helpful. If you work in the area would highly recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Love this place, especially for Taco Tuesday! They have the best fish tacos, which make me really want to visit Ensenada! All of the servers are super nice and explain the menu items super well. Alberto was our server tonight and he was super friendly. He was always checking up on us and making sure we had what we needed."}
{"text":"Overpriced, not authentic but comes with the territory.  It's Scottsdale, and when your in an upscale neighborhood it always seems the restaurants do not feel they have to go the extra mile towards pleasing their customers because they will always get more.  I'm giving a 3 star because our server was very friendly and she was a real person. The food was ok.  If you want to eat at a great restaurant at the same prices, try The Mission in Old Town! You will not regret it.  It's only 5 miles away."}
{"text":"We went here on a Saturday night and they had a 20 minute wait, no problem because we could have easily spent an hour walking around the area. The wait was just what they said and once inside we immediately liked the ambiance of SOL. The waitress was pleasant and we were off to a good start. I liked the salsa and thought the tortillas in place of chips was a nice touch and delicious too. We ordered the goat cheese and mushroom appetizer and it was a win as well. Now the part that let us down: We ordered the carne asade street tacos and the fish tacos. The fish tacos were just so so and the carne asade bordered on rubbery. It left the experience as disappointing. Especially for ordering what seemed like a signature dish. We might go back sometime, but we wouldn't try these dishes if we did."}
{"text":"Love this place! Alberto is amazing, such a friendly and outgoing server. Happy hour here is where it's at!"}
{"text":"Bland. Overpriced. Great vibe and cool spot for drinks, and I mean cold, so bring a jacket.  #carne asada burro was a bean burro with a few a slivers of meat. At $15 I expected more. ##red rice bland and boring.  #black beans same. #fish tacos mush. Were they fried? Breaded? Who knows! #house margarita boring, too much ice. Not sure why (probably because it was just so boring), but I was distracted by the ice-machine ice. Very firm, doesnt melt, decreases the drink volume, done in 4 gulps. Taffer would be proud.  Rubio's easily puts Sol to shame.  Ho hum."}
{"text":"It's a nice place to eat and have drinks with friends or family.  I always order the ceviche and on Tequila Thirsday a flight of what's on special.  The food is good and prices aren't crazy so it's a pretty predictable place to eat. The manager has stopped by every time to ask how the food was and thank us for coming in which I appreciate.  The bad reviews seem all over the place sooooo, to break it down, It's definitely not On The Border but it's not La Hacienda, it sits somewhere in the middle closer to La Hacienda and I think most people will find it predictably good like myself and enjoy it."}
{"text":"The food & ambiance are excellent. I particularly enjoyed the Shrimp Cucarachas and the Hot &  Raw Tropical Ceviche.  The best baja Mexican cuisine in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Don't generally care for Mexican However, the food was excellent  The service was very good  Prices were okay"}
{"text":"Everything we tried here was amazing. I had some family visiting from out of town and this place did not disappoint. Try the ceviche, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. I always avoided it for food, it's just bad especially with so many other options in the area. We decided to go for just drinks and after one round our server abandoned us. Never to be found again. We finally asked someone else to close is out after waiting 30 min in hopes someone would come. We awaited another 15 min as he attempted to find our ticket. We received the tab, no sorry, no anything. We quickly closed out and left. I will NEVER come back, with Eddie Vs, Zinc and North dominating the service and food in that area there's no reason to ever even go back."}
{"text":"Food is very good- reason for the reduced stars is that we asked for the GRILLED SWEET CORN to be cut off the cob. the bartender said the chef refused to do it but she'd get us a steak knife so we could do it ourselves. she said other people have asked and the chef refused. i said - go ask the chef. he still refused, so i said, no thanks. seriously - it's a nice restaurant not a picnic - i don't want to eat a greasy corn cob with my hands and have all that stuff stuck in my teeth. and it takes 2 seconds to cut the corn off the cob but it's going to be really messy if i do it at the bar myself. not sure what the reason is, and while i don't think the customer is always right - i don't think this request; especially since others had made it; was too demanding or burdensome."}
{"text":"My dad told me to find somewhere casual with good food and a super fun vibe, and that's what I found! First off, I'm a margarita on the rocks kind of girl but the frozen one is delicious so when I go back ill order that right away. Secondly, the burrito was a nive size and you get two sides with it Incase you're extra hungry. Thirdly, our waiter Alberto was the most helpful guy I've run into in these parts! Will definitely be coming back next year when I'm in town for spring training, thanks Sol and Alberto!"}
{"text":"Any restaurant who brings you a tequila taster before a glass of water has something special going on! I was quite excited for my margarita to arrive. It took about 10 minutes for the drink to arrive. The assured us the drinks were scratch, but boy oh boy, they weren't good. I had just come from another local restaurant that had excellent drinks and horrible chips, salsa, and guac.   This place was the exact opposite. The food was great, and the drinks just didn't taste quite right. I sent my drink back and they brought a me a different version of the same drink, but it was still a no go. I didn't finish my margarita, and neither did my friend - that's saying something.  I'll be seeking out a hole in the wall next go around."}
{"text":"I organized an event for my company at SOL Cocina last month, and we had an amazing time.  Their private room in the back of the restaurant was completely private and spacious, with rustic décor and great lighting.  Shelly was our contact, and she made the menu planning easy - we had a family style menu and everything was delicious.  Get a hold of Shelly Hayes for your next event if you just want to lay back an enjoy your event (*drink in hand) instead of running around like a chicken with your head cut off making sure everyone is happy."}
{"text":"One of the worst in Scottsdale. The few dishes which were good have either been removed or modified. Unfortunately nothing tasted good. This is definitely my last visit."}
{"text":"Environment is very nice .. Staff not too friendly .. Service was not so good .. Food was really good .. I ordered chicken enchiladas and they forgot to add chicken took my plate and brought it back with the chicken on the top of my enchiladas still rated good but I know this is not how it was supposed to be .. Not pleased"}
{"text":"First of all I am appalled that anyone actually thinks this is good Mexican food. Obviously anyone thinking so has never had quality Mexican food. There is not a lot of cultural diversity it seems in those who reviewed the restaurant and maybe that's because anyone who is Hispanic would not consider this to be authentic Mexican food.   Bland fusion of wanna be contemporary takes on Mexican classic Baja dishes at best...save your money. It's as authentic as Chipotle across the street. Any idiot can make better guacamole or margaritas. Here is a Latin word to describe the food and drink \"desabrido\".  The place is pretty and what you would want a Mexican restaurant to look like but it's sad that they think that's enough for the average consumer.   Our table ordered the naked guacamole which anyone can make it was do blah the tostadas it came with where good instead of your typical chips. But the salsas weren't even as hot as the waitress claimed (she said it was a 10 on a scale of 1-10). My tween ate it like nothing it was so bland. The puerto Nuevo shrimp tacos had no seasoning or flavor and the presentation was terrible. The Baja shrimp tacos had none of the avocado sauce the menu claimed and the margarita was watered down and had no salt.  The waitress forgot to take our drink order and we had to ask a busboy for drinks. She also forgot to come back to our table and we waited 40 minutes for the check. I don't mind paying for good food but hate over paying for mediocracy. Really I've had better Mexican food from food lunch trucks."}
{"text":"3 tacos 30 bucks. Saw one the pictures said I'll have this.  big mistake my fault 30 for three tacos?"}
{"text":"Took girlfriend for her birthday dinner and was pleasantly surprised. Service was spot on and the dinner was great too."}
{"text":"FABulous!  Met a girlfriend for lunch here yesterday. Great location.  Parking garage right next door.  The chips served before the meal were okay. Not great. Bean dip pretty good. Salsa quite good.  I ordered their beef tacos, it was REALLY good! The meat was tender and cooked perfectly. I don't recall what type of pepper was on it, but the waitress suggested that I get them without it and with the pico sauce on the side (because I'm not a fan of hot spicey). She made the right call, the tacos were perfect without it. I tried the pico sauce and again she was right... even it was too hot spicey for me. I pulled a few of the tomato chunks out to add a nice kick of flavor.  I'll be back. Just won't waste my calories on the chips on the front end!"}
{"text":"I've only ever been here for lunch (including today), but I've always found the food to be pretty good! The ambiance is nice on the patio or in the dining room, making it a great place all times of the year. I've only ever ever experienced great service as well. The only slight complaint I have is the price and size of portions. For example, their chicken tortilla soup might be the best I've ever had, but it's almost 9 bucks for a bowl and they don't offer a cup portion. Their chopped salad (which in my opinion really needs an added protein) ends up being about 16 bucks once you add meat to it. These portions are HUGE, which is fine if you're sharing, but totally unnecessary and wasteful otherwise. I'd rather see a more reasonable portion and a more reason price than what they currently offer. I would certainly recommend for lunch, dinner, or happy hour nevertheless!"}
{"text":"Out for a relaxing meal with my much-loved wife. Ordered a bunch of appetizers - several hot. All brought at the same time. OK.   Guess what? A minute after the apps arrive, so do the mains! When I squawk that we haven't had a chance to even sample all of the apps, I am assured by the server that the mains can be \"kept warm\" until we are ready for them. In other words, no fresh ones for us! But, hey, take your time!  Worse still, the food was meh. The chips were actively bad. I mean, this is a Mexican restaurant. In Arizona! Come on!  Diners, why waste an opportunity to enjoy a good meal. Don't bother with this place - you can do better."}
{"text":"I came here years ago and just now returned. We came here for lunch. The chips and salsa were good. We were not too hungry so we ordered some tacos. They were excellent. I don't know why it has taken me so long to return. I live out of state but visit frequently. I will be back!"}
{"text":"My work buddy brought me here for my last day of work lunch. He raved about it for a while and finally got to take me.   The decor is really nice and I loved the front entrance with the wood! The food was yummy too - really big portions (at least for me) but everything tasted amazing. I am not usually a huge fan of Mexican, so I tend to go with basics I know I like and try others food to see what else I can get myself into. I had the quesadilla - I know standard and probably boring, but it was really good and big enough that I had it the next day too! My friends had tacos and they were both delish! One was chicken and the other pork if I remember correctly.  We rarely go to that area since we live in Arcadia, and the only reason I was up there was because I used to work there, however on the off chance we are in the area, I would love to take the hubs as he enjoys that cuisine very much!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant. I enjoyed the decor a lot. Although it wasn't authentic Mexican food, was still very good. Loved all the food, service was great and I plan on coming back!"}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday and had the greatest time ever!! Arnoldo was our server and was the greatest server ever!!! He gave us two free desserts on him for my birthday and he was just the sweetest! Definitely this is the place to go if you are celebrating!"}
{"text":"We had dinner at SOL two of our seven nights in Scottsdale. Love the food and the Blackberry/Ginger Margaritas!! Some of the must haves on the menu: Peel and Eat Shrimp, Beet and Watermelon Salad and Kobe Beef Strip Steak!  Luckily we are returning home to Orange County so I have SOL Newport Beach and Solita in Huntington Beach - yummo."}
{"text":"This is in my top two Mexican restaurants (the other being La Santisima in Central Phoenix). The menu at SOL is unique, but delicious, and not so derivative of authentic Mexican that anything is lost. The service is prompt and kind. The atmosphere is kid-friendly, but still a little up-scale, and you can't beat their happy hour on the patio."}
{"text":"If I could give the food four stars and the service one star, I would. That being said, perhaps I went into this restaurant on a bad day. Initially, the service was great and our waiter, Rodrigo was certainly trying his best, but the dining experience fell short and the horrible service was a distraction from the great food. At one point, I had to wait fifteen minutes to have my glass of water refilled as I tried to catch the attention of a waiter and watched the table next to us have their glasses refilled twice. To say the least, the experience was odd. For such a nice (and moderately expensive restaurant) a couple of the servers had terrible adequate. Personally, I go out to eat for the entire experience. If I had wanted good food, I could've made it for myself at home...dining out should be about more than just an expensive meal and attractive decor. I don't think I would go back if given the choice. Ultimately, despite the good food, SOL Cocina left a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"Was looking for a new spot to check out for dinner and stumbled upon this place. First impression....the girl at the hostess stand, was very much not the hostess and didn't seem to have a clue what was going on. Somebody finally came over that understood what was happening and seated us on the patio. Our server was great and attentive. The chips and salsa are different than what you expect, but delicious at that! For dinner, we ordered the pork carnitas and chicken quesadilla. Everything was outstanding. The prices are a bit steeper than you would expect at a typical Mexican restaurant, but that is because this is not typical. It is more authentic and less Tex Mex. I would love to come back and try some of the other menu items."}
{"text":"We stopped in for some lunch with friends.  This was our first time here.  Service was very good, attentive and well spoken.  The food was very good, I had the carne asada street tacos and my wife had carnitas street tacos.  The table chips and sauces were great.  Overall this was a very great experience, we will be back."}
{"text":"Excellent margaritas. We Started with the tableside shaken Grande Clase Azul Margarita and an appetizer or of the Chile Gordo and the Sweer Grilled Corn. All were excellent. The Chile Gordo however is only for one person, sharing is a little sparse. Next we split the Carne Asado Street Taco plate which was excellent. Great atmosphere, great service.  We will be back."}
{"text":"4.5 Stars  Tried a few food items:  *The tortillas and salsa - surprised the salsa wasn't spicier. The bean dip they also place on the table was tasted but it lacked any flavor so after one taste, I didn't go back for another.  *Guacamole Sol - bursts of flavors and I wish we ordered two! *Chorizo and Mushroom Queso - by far a favorite thing we tried but eat it while it's hot. When it gets cold it's not the same and it's not as tasty.  *Grilled Sweet Corn - flavorful and just enough grill taste.  *Street Tacos - we ordered the shrimp and steak. The steak was okay but the shrimp with the mango salsa was bursting with flavor.  *Peel and Eat Shrimp - our second favorite of the dishes we tasted. The shrimps are a great size, the seasoning is lick-your-fingers delicious.   All of the dishes were amazing. We also tried their Cucumber Jalapeño Margarita. Yummy. The only down side to our experience was our server. He wasn't very attentive and we had to ask other servers passing by for additional items."}
{"text":"Came to SOL Mexican Cocina for Tuesday date night for some tacos. We had gotten there and waited for a table and was quickly sat outside as asked. When we sat down we ordered some drinks and some happy hour food. There was live music coming from the inside but had speakers so we could hear from outside. When we got the food our street tacos seem to be very salty. Taco deals are a good deal, but the only downfall is that they're over salted (the pork, chicken, and beef). The service was fairly good, only had forgotten the side of sour cream which came out extremely watery. Might come back to try other menu items since we live so close by, but would definitely have to skip on the tacos."}
{"text":"I've been here several times, each time I get something different, I grew up on mexican Pueblo food, the real rustic stuff, nothing will ever compare. However, this place comes close with their tacos, rice and frijoles a la olla. The mole could use a little spice. But I love the pumpkin seeds garnish. I'm spanish I eat alot of hot stuff...this is the only thing missing from this menu"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar. Female bartender Devin was really nice and friendly. Decent tequila selection (expected though). Ceviche and goat cheese peanut dishes were awesome, but the chicken tacos were a little dry and needed salt.  All and all, I would go back."}
{"text":"I had the beer battered taco, the filet and shrimp taco the house margarita and mango con chile margarita. My fiancé had the cucarachas (shrimp) and the duck taco and the fish tacos..  well the duck had this sauce that was sweet with a little spice , avocado and I kept going for his food, that duck was perfect. My beer battered shrimp taco was my favorite! And my steak and shrimp had avocado and chile I put a little lime and it I finished my food despite on how full I was, it was mouth watering. Quick service although the restaurant was completely full and very nice manager on duty made us and every other customer feel cared for. Must've been a smooth night because the vibe was just perfect. Casual enough, fancy a little but I didn't give it 5 stars for nothing."}
{"text":"Great happy hour! best sweet potato tacos ! A little pricey for Mexican but so worth it"}
{"text":"Great food! The guac with mango and goat cheese is a must. I also recommend the spicy marg and the carne asada quesadilla."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here on a friday night for the first time and were extremely pleased with our service and food. Arnoldo went above and beyond with his recomendations and overall knowledge of the menu. Arnoldo helped us to decide on every item and we devoured everything! We loved our experience and definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about.   The service and ambiance are fine. The naked guacamole, bland. The street tacos, cold. Although  they have a nice variety to choose from.   We ordered some carne asada and garlic mezcal chicken tacos. The charbroiled chicken was rubbery and tough. Like chewing an eraser. I had to check it several times to see that it was cooked thoroughly.   On the plus side, the salsa is very good. The sides, quinoa-great, black beans, tasty. Spicy coleslaw, great.   It wasn't that busy, yet the food was substandard. Sorry."}
{"text":"I love this place!  One of my favorite restaurants in the SFV.  There margaritas are awesome and the signature lava Bowl   \"Special of the House\" for two or three is amazing! Great atmosphere and good service.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"made a last minute reservation here. Everyone we encountered was very friendly and helpful. the atmosphere was fun for a Saturday night, definitely both couples and groups of friends enjoying themselves. however, the food left something to be desired. our tortillas were too chewy/tough to be enjoyable and the fish in the fish tacos was too dense (not flaky). Maybe a good choice for meeting friends for apps and drinks but don't come for just the food."}
{"text":"We had a delicious dinner after being at a conference all day. We were seated immediately and the ambiance is beautiful.   Our waiter was beyond fabulous and he made some recommendations. Our server greeted us and then brought us black bean dip, salsa and chips. The dip was very good and it comes with all meals. I ordered the strawberry margarita and it was so dang good. I ordered that based upon all the Yelp reviews and it didn't disappoint.   For the entree I ordered the naked burrito with carne asada and my husband ordered a shrimp burrito. We also tried the elote corn. Everything was delicious and it was so much food. Although I ordered mine naked it came out regular. I ended up just eating the inside of the burrito which is what I wanted.   I recommended this place to my colleagues the next day. If I'm ever in Scottsdale again I'll be back."}
{"text":"Decided to eat here after passing by multiple times. Apparently on Sunday, they have live music which was great. They guy had a great voice. Our server Lane was awesome. I had a watermelon margarita that was great. The other people in my party had margaritas too. They had nothing but good things to say about them. The food is made fresh from scratch. We ordered all kinds of tacos and quesadillas. Food was great. The only issue was the portion size. Trust me and get 2 orders of whatever taco you decide on. Other than that no complaints. We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Dined here with a few of my friends and took advantage of the happy hour specials.  We ended up going on a Tuesday which happens to be Taco Tuesday there.  Should be mandatory of every Mexican restaurant to have Taco Tuesday specials.  We started with the mushroom and chorizo con queso which was good.  Had the 6 pack of street tacos for $11 which was a great deal.  The beer battered fish was the best, the the chicken taco was a little dry and the pork has pockets of fat that were very unappealing.  Also added a viper taco.  It was supposed to have ghost chili on it.  While it had a bit of heat, definitely wasn't anywhere near the hottest item ever had.  And for $7 just for 1 taco I did feel cheated.  Overall it was ok.  Happy hour items/prices are pretty good but would not be all that happy paying regular menu prices."}
{"text":"My manager and I came here for dinner on a Monday night while she was in town. I had never been here before, but had passed by it many times and was excited to try. We arrived around 6:30 and there wasn't a wait for our party of 2. We decided to start with drinks and apps and catch up for a bit before ordering dinner. I had a large house margarita which was good. The black bean dip and tomatillo salsa they bring out was very delicious, though I wish they had normal sized chips as opposed to the tostadas that they have to break. We also ordered the naked guac, which was really good but very very small for the price.   For the main event, I decided on the carne asada tacos and we shared an order of grilled sweet corn. The corn was really good, I'd get those again. The carne asada tacos were okay. We waited a little longer than normal for our food and it wasn't hot, but not cold enough for me to complain. I may have enjoyed them more had they been hotter. Our server was great and I liked the atmosphere. I saw they have live music some nights and a pretty good happy hour so I'd likely return."}
{"text":"Great food. Tried it for the first time at the Yelp Sol Train event. Was able to try the guacamole, chicken quesadillas, carne asada as well as pork carnitas street tacos and frozen margaritas. The food was all really flavorful, however a the mushroom quesadilla and pork carnitas tacos had a surprising and unexpected kick to them. Food was great though. I'll definitely be back to try some of the other menu items!"}
{"text":"Stopped into Sol from hearing a bunch of great reviews! Well those people were not wrong! The atmosphere, food, and service was great! I went on a whim and asked our bartender Wally to just choose our drinks, appetizers, and entrees for us. He did not disappoint! Also made us some killer margaritas and was very knowledgeable on all of their tequilas! Can't wait to go back! Wally kicks A$$!"}
{"text":"Recently moved to Scottsdale and love Mexican. Stopped here just to try it out. Was so tasty. Had fabulous tacos with sweet potato in it. I will be coming back. Very good"}
{"text":"The food was just okay. The taco chips were tasteless and too thick. The menu is very limited and although we were there early on a Saturday night, the waitress came back to tell me my meal was sold out. She should have known that before I ordered. The décor is very pretty, but the acoustics made conversation difficult."}
{"text":"Poor quality black beans taste horrible.  Ordered the chicken burrito in which I could not find hardly any chicken. The guacamole dip was extremely small for the price. Finally you will die of thirst by the time they get around to filling your water glass. I also asked for small extra salsa which was ignored.  Please go elsewhere as you will be disappointed on multi levels."}
{"text":"Awesome place.   Worth trying to see if it's your style.   Great service and food.  Reasonably priced.   No complaints"}
{"text":"Loved the ambiance, the service and the food.  Checked in with Yelp and got the $5 Skinny Margarita, which had a perfect blend of tart and sweet. Once seated, you are welcomed with a basket of small saucer sized tortillas, some sprinkled with what appeared to be chili pepper and some without. Alongside the tortillas, come the salsa and the bean dip. oh the Bean Dip!!!! It was one of my favorite parts of the meal. The bean dip is warm and so rich with flavor. I loved the roasted pumpkin seeds in the bean dip with gave it a wonderful nutty flavor with a crunch. The salsa was so-so... lacked a bit of flavor. I think that's why they also give you small plate alongside the salsa with a trio of salt, habanero sauce and limes to kick it up a notch.   I ordered the Goat Cheese Enchiladas. oh my! I loved it. The enchilada sauce was perfection. The sauce was such a well balance of citrusy-tangy-salty, I could lick the plate. Side dishes were spicy coleslaw and the quinoa. Both which were good but not something memorable.   Hubs got three different tacos. Which I wasn't a big fan of. The tortillas are not hard nor soft. They come out slightly toasted which if you don't eat them fast enough, gets very chewy and tough. I did like the Viper Taco though. It had that simmering seething heat that I love. The beans and rice were meh.  Service was good and informative. The ambiance was cozy and romantic. I liked the open kitchen concept as well."}
{"text":"The best Mexican restaurant I've ever been to. Blends so many unique flavors and serves the greatest chips and salsa/bean dip. I could not recommend this place more. Excellent service. The staff is very flexible. We made our reservation but got there a half hour early. They seated us almost immediately. Must try!"}
{"text":"Fromosas. Enough said. Still the food is amazing! Corn on the cob appetizer is a must!"}
{"text":"Came here to meet up with my friend and her boyfriend and was able to snag a bit of space at the bar- it was a PEREFCT Arizona evening, so it's awesome they have an outdoor bar. The ambiance and lighting is wonderful! I like the open kitchen too. Its a little tight space though inside it seems like.  I got a drink (Strawberry Basil Martini) and the cocount calamari which I 100% recommend! Their chips and salsa are amazing too!!   I just googled to try to figure out which drink I got and found out there is one in Newport Beach?! So close....  Convenient parking too :)"}
{"text":"The Duck was delicious.  Crispy, flavorful and not greasy.  Staff was friendly, informative and patient as we had a baby with us."}
{"text":"Ok. Meh. I hate that word, meh. It's something that reminds me of Minnesota. But so does this place. I don't know why. Our server was attitudinal. The food was hit and miss. I felt like they were all about the $$. I need to pay now. For $45.21, I'm all full. That's all I can muster."}
{"text":"Delicious food, excellent service, beautiful decor!! My boyfriend and I had an amazing experience!! I recommend the mango mimosas and chilaquiles! Love it!! Oh and they have live music! Such a nice touch!!"}
{"text":"Had lunch at SOL.  It's touristy.  Very touristy.  So that means we had slow service and overthought, overpriced food.  Almost forgot the weak, expensive margaritas.  SOL is the last place I'd pick if I wanted a bite to eat at Scottsdale Qtr.   It wouldn't even cross my mind if I wanted Mexican Food."}
{"text":"We went here for happy hour because we thought they had a pretty good hh menu. sooooooo....The interior of this place is beautiful! The service was good. 3.50 for all beers, heck yes! Onto the food I go; the tostadas and salsa was pretty good, nothing special. my boyfriend ordered the shrimp cocktail which was ok, nothing to rave about, I actually like the one from food city better. I got the shrimp \"cucarachas\" ( it was kind of disturbing they were calling it cockroaches) anyway so it came it and it was whole shrimp with eyes and everything...they looked like cockroaches :/...they were too spicy to enjoy.   The prices for the appetizers didn't seem bad until the portions came out. The portions are able to fill up a 3 year old. It's definitely overpriced for less than mediocre food. Brio next door has a better happy hour and better food."}
{"text":"No Air Conditioning.... Hot and Humid inside..... Sweating while trying to spend time with friends.....  just asked for check. Going to a Restaurant that has A/C.."}
{"text":"Had reservations for dinner - requested patio seating and the staff had a reserved table waiting for me and my lady when we arrived. Or server Stephanie was awesome - food and drinks fabulous as expected. Thanks for making a special evening!"}
{"text":"Sol was a really pleasant surprise during our vacation.  It has a great ambience with indoor/outdoor seating and an indoor/outdoor bar.  The food is super inventive Mexican fare and incredibly flavorful.  I especially loved the short rib tacos, and their guac is to die for.   The tacos came with a quinoa salad with cranberries that was wonderful. Amazing cocktails as well.  Definitely not your ordinary Mexican restaurant!  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I was not greeted never ever greeted I sat out side had to walked in to ask for help the blonde with the fake boobs told me to go outside to the bar which there was no one at the bar this is worst service ever ever ever ever in a restaurant that bitch should be fired or this restaurant need to be shut down March 21 2018"}
{"text":"This was our fourth time dining here and have always enjoyed our previous experiences. This night was extremely disappointing.  We took friends with us, that had never been there, and we were very embarrassed.  We had no problem with the service, but the food, at best, was mediocre.  Everything came out cold.  I ordered the carne asada tacos, which is something I have ordered before.  The tacos were wet and soggy; the rice and beans were also cold, and half the amount of which is normally on the plate.  I don't know if they have a new chef, but this was a waste of time and money.  If we decide to go back, it will be a while.  It is a shame because this is a very nice venue."}
{"text":"Was not impressed.  This restaurant is located in a trendy shopping plaza, surrounded by trendy and boutique stores.  I should not have been surprised by the dining experience but I was.  The restaurant smelled of fish, not pleasant cooked or spicy fish, but just plain fish.  If I had been eating at the pier this would have been ok, but even after I got home that evening my clothes even smelled like fish.  The food was supposed to be trendy mexican, but I got more of a hipster feel from it.  They just tried too hard.  The salsa's had a little flavor but were not unique.  The appetizers had great presentation but again the flavor was not unique (coconut calamari and guacamole sol).  The salad (ensalada sol) was not memorable.  The street tacos; chicken was dry, the pork was greasy and SALTY, I stayed away from the beef.  The server forgot my dessert.  Wouldn't recommend it, won't return to it."}
{"text":"Loved the corn appetizer and the garlic grilled shrimp with red rice was amazing. Only con is that it's a little loud but that would not stop me from going again."}
{"text":"Great tacos! And, the calamari appetizer is a must have. We really enjoyed the food and the atmosphere. Try the quinoa instead of rice and beans for a change. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this place. Tacos are amazing. Bar service is prompt and attentive. Gio is a fantastic bartender. Extremely knowledgable about tequilas. Very friendly. We will be back specifically to see him!"}
{"text":"I did not have a problem getting seated.  True, the place was almost at capacity.  Service was excellent.  Loved the black bean dip provided with the corn chips.  My wife tried the carne asada quisadilla.  The taste, presentation, options, and quantity we're great.  The side of couscous (probably misspelled) was excellent.  Nice atmosphere and adornment."}
{"text":"I have mixed feeling about this place. I saw so many four star reviews so I decided to try this place.   When we walked in we were seated right away by the host. The place was decorated very modern with dim lights. Lots of large tables for big parties. The host told us that our server was too busy to help us so he was going to serve us. First time I've ever heard if this. The host was able to tell us about the menu and was very helpful. The place had lots of people but wasn't that busy. We were the only table being served by the host. I thought this was strange and we saw the server. I didn't think he was that busy to take our order. Oh well so be it.   So I ordered the Carne Asada Street Taco Plate. This came with 3 tacos, black beans, and rice. I wasn't too impressed. I thought it was pretty bland. No taste at all. My son had the Grilled Chicken Burrito and it came with rice and beans. The Burrito has huge. I tried a portion of this and it was as bland as the Street Tacos. My wife had the Ensenada (fish) Taco Plate and she was not impressed either. At first I thought it was just my dish but after trying everyone's dishes I got to say the food was just bland.   So since our server was our host, it seemed like we were ignored a lot. The server bypassed our table and filled all the other tables except ours. We all recognized that and thought that was very rude. After we were almost all finished then the server started to take care of us. Filled our cups and gave us more chips. Little too late.   I don't understand why the host had to serve us. There was a table after us that got seated and their server helped them out. Why were we targeted only? This didn't help make our meal enjoyable and the food just didn't seem up to par.   All I have to say is I'm very disappointed at the service and food."}
{"text":"Great service that you can count on. Everything on the menu is great and be sure to try the appetizers. The sweet corn and coconut calamari will be a full meal for a couple on date night and the entrees are made like mom was in the kitchen with lots of love. Definitely try the short rib entree if you're a meat lover and you'll be impressed. The sauce is the perfect spice level for even the weakest taste buds with tons of flavor. We will be back and recommending to friends and family."}
{"text":"Had to give Sol 5 stars simply because of the super friendly and helpful staff.  Food was good, had the street taco fight which consists of 6 tacos and an order of guac.  While I have had better Mexican food for cheaper it was still very nice, fresh and was all well made. Atmosphere was nice and pleasent except that they kept opening up a side door to do cleaning which let in a lot of unwanted cold air. Normally I would knock down a star except for the great staff."}
{"text":"I like this place, service was good the waiter was great, me and my wife tried the tacos they didn't disappoint. The chavela's were good,  It was a nice place to go have a drink and some tacos ."}
{"text":"Absolute disappointment to have a lunch for 8 people. They ran out of bean dip and drinks and then upcharged us for jalapeños and cheese. Slapped the menu and the bill on our table and didn't even ask if we would want dessert. No apology and management didn't care. They had some bridal shower or party in the back room and didn't care of customers sitting in the front. Then why keep the restaurant open? there are so many places to eat in the valley. Food was good but service get ZERO points."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant!! I have been a fan of the Newport Beach location for years. Scottsdale definitely did not disappoint! The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. The drinks are fresh (worth the extra wait for the tasty Cucumber Jalapeño marg). And the food? Goes without saying, it's CRAVE worthy. This is a new location, so I expected the usual growing pains. But overall, a great dining experience. Welcome to the neighborhood, SOL Cocina!"}
{"text":"We were in the mood for some Mexican style food this weekend and after discussing some options decided to stop at SOL and wow are we happy we did. I'm giving this place 5 stars all around for the service, food, drinks, and interior. We started off the night with some margaritas which I had the cucumber jalapeno and pineapple serrano which both were spicy with a little sweetness they were great. They start you have with their round crispy tortilla chips and some bean dip with salsa while you order. For the entree I had the grilled fish zarandeado tacos which were packed with flavor and had pineapple as well. The great thing about the food is that SOL focuses on the quality of the food and not so much on the extras like cheese and sauces etc. Everyone in our group were exceptionally pleased with the entrees and appetizers. After the meal we had saw that there was a 100 year old Grand Marnier on the menu and had to see what it tasted like. It was so smooth and delicious! Sol is a one of the restaurants at the quarter that you must try and no matter what you try you'll be happy with and if you not sure ask the staff they were great with suggestions and pairing. Overall a wonderful great experience and we will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"The food was excellent - nice music for Mother's Day. Probably would get even better service when it is not a holiday, but overall, a really great place to go."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food.  I had the Carnitas and they were spot on.  Very Tender and moist with fantastic flavor.  My wife had their chicken quesadilla and she being the queen of quesadillas said it was the best she had ever eaten.  It was good if i don't say so myself.  Staff very helpful and friendly.  Restaurant is very clean and the bathrooms are immaculate.  Very highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place was great.  Good atmosphere, great service and tasty food.  I would recommend checking this place out.  Try the quinoa cranberry side salad"}
{"text":"The restaurant has a nice ambiance to it, the food was presented spectacularly and best of all it tasted delicious. Our server Katie was awesome, you should request her the next time you come in. Thanks for a great experience!"}
{"text":"I came to Sol because i had been searching The area for a good margarita, which is surprisingly hard to find, and let me tell you they did not disappoint. I had the Jalapeño/cucumber margarita and it was amazing. The entire experience was great. Everything from the chips to my carnitas torta was amazingly good."}
{"text":"The food may be good, but I wouldn't know since this place asked me to wait for over two hours to be seated for a table for three.  To be fair, we went in on a Friday night around 7:00 with no reservation.  There were quite a few people waiting for tables and the restaurant was overflowing with people.  I placed my name in with the hostess and was informed it would be a 45-55 minute wait.  Fair enough - seems like a reasonable amount of time to wait on a Friday with no reservations. We wasted time by walking around Scottsdale Quarter and having a juice drink at True Food. We ventured back to Sol and were able to find a spot at the bar.  I had the skinny margarita, which was tasty enough, but nothing special. My guy had the house margarita and he said it was average.  After an hour of waiting, I went to check on our table. The hostess said it would be another 25 minutes for our table to be ready.  We were enjoying the people watching, but growing hungry nonetheless. We decided to wait sice we had already waited this long.  After another 35 minutes, my beau, who is not as rational as I am, went to speak to the hostess and was told it would be yet another half hour. At this point we were looking at a two hour wait with no end in sight. How could we trust them not to ask us to wait another 30 minutes? We left, but not before my cranky guy chewed out the manager. Maybe you could chalk this up to the growing pains of a new restaurant, or the inability of a young staff to properly gauge the wait and manage their tables, but my experience left me thoroughly disappointed and I will not be going back to try the food any time soon."}
{"text":"I thought SOL was very good. The chips and salsa is the best part (HA) but the food is great as well! Very impressed with the service. I will be back."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to this restaurant yesterday, and it was an outstanding experience. Although it was a busy Saturday afternoon, the service was still absolutely outstanding. The food was high-quality, with fantastic taste. The atmosphere inside of the restaurant is superb. You can choose to self Park adjacent to the restaurant, or utilize the valet parking directly outside of it. I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great service, manager came to check in with us a few times which was nice! The margaritas are delish! The coconut calamari is awesome! The prime rib tacos were the best ones of all the ones we had. I didn't love their chips but it seems like a lot of Mexican restaurants tend to have chips that I don't love. Otherwise, great place!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing!! Waited 20 minutes for a table. Was seated ii front of the live performer, it was so loud, hard to hear anyone at the table talk and even had to yell to place an order. A server brought us the wrong food and then brought our food to the wrong table. Placed it in front of those guests and then realized it was wrong and brought it to our table which kinda grossed me out. My steak taco was completely inedible. It was soaked in grease and the one bite I took it just tasted like grease so I sent that back. The street tacos were small and covered in cabbage that made the whole taco bitter. The complementary chips were good, salsa was good, bean dip was bland. I gave two stars because the server was very understanding did not charge us for the grease Taco and brought the check quickly so we could get out of there'. Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, food and service. The guacamole is so fresh tasting. I had the shrimp quesadillas and my husband had the chicken burrito, both entrees were flavorful and filling. Great spot for date night or happy hour with friends. I would definitely recommend SOL to visitors as it has a warm Spanish style feel."}
{"text":"Food so authentically Mexican, Trump would want to build a wall around it! ... Sit at the bar because Wally the bartender is fun, engaging and he pours some mean drinks!"}
{"text":"Just a quickie update. 2013 is the year of the taco. And I was in the area and was craving lunch from SOL Cocina.   I ordered first a beer, Victoria. This is a Vienna Lager style beer. A light beer basically. My man brought me tostada circles dusted with spices, and salsa on the side. I ask for the Carnitas Street tacos, three of them showing heirloom pork slow-roasted & shredded, chicharron, avocado, onion & tomatillo salsa. $11.  Then I want a shot straight up of Ilegal Mezcal Respo, an untamed, exceptional handcrafted, small batch tequila. $18.  Today, I simply enjoyed a very comfortable house with a vibrant menu full of authentic Mexican flavors."}
{"text":"Good decor, good location...........that's about it. After we were told it was a 45-55 minute wait we headed to the bar. We were at the bar for a good ten minutes before a bartender came over to help us. The main bartender working outside, wouldn't even acknowledge us let alone get our drink order. This was noticed by all the other bar guests who were commenting on it. One even suggested that if we showed cleavage we would get quicker service. Then our beeper vibrated signaling our table was ready...............oh but apparently it vibrated \"accidentally\". When we finally got our table, we waited for our waitress Tracy to come over. That was another 10 minutes of waiting to be greeted because she could not handle the 6 tables she had. She was perfectly nice, but service was slow and food was average. Nothing about this experience would make me to again for this type of food and definitely not this type of service."}
{"text":"The margaritas were very good and the tacos we're pretty good as well. I loved the volcanes taco, and surf n turf taco.  Fun ambiance and would recommend for large groups"}
{"text":"Everything was delicious! Besides the Queso dip. I hate stringy cheese. If it were creamier like fundido, it would be better. I had the jalapeno cucumber margarita and it was amazing:)"}
{"text":"Food was a four star rating BUT I almost walked out before I ordered. Our waitress was so condescending, rude and was rushing us to order. If it wasn't for her that it would be a five star rating. If you like service from a waitress that makes you feel small as she holds her hand on her hip tapping her foot anticipating you to order stupidly, then this is the place for you. Although the chile rellenos were off the hook we will NOT return. Carmen made our $257.00 dinner for four disappointing and unforgettable for all the wrong reasons."}
{"text":"My family and I came to Sol last Monday evening. Based on my last visit I suggested this place as food and service were excellent.  This visit was not very pleasant as our server I believe Veronica is her name was not very attentive.  We had to wait a while before she came to the table and then she kept coming back very far apart. She kept going to chat and laugh with another young lady which seem to be friends or family.  We felt very disappointed as she spent lots of time with her ignoring all the guests around.  On top of that when we asked questions her demeanor was awful and arrogant.     Food was great with lots of flavor.  I usually only write positive comments, but this has being stuck on our minds and it has being the theme of conversation for a couple of days."}
{"text":"Rarely do I write 2-Star reviews, so I'll try to make this as constructive as possible:  SOL is good for large groups and they accept reservations online. Their staff will call the day of to confirm your rez and even seat your party if the entire group isn't present at the time of your reservation.  I was visiting Scottsdale and had family in town as well, the location and easy reservations system on a Saturday night seemed like a win-win.  The menu of drinks far outweighs the food, which for a 30-something adult is fine. Probably not so much for my retired parents or teenager cousin. We all found something to order and food came out relatively quickly, which was great for a busy evening with a big group.  The worst part of the night is when they lost my Dad's credit card. The bill was presented, I watched my Dad put his card in the bill folder and somewhere between the table and the register/POS system, no one knows what happened.   Our group spent 15 minutes searching the dining room with cell phone flashlights looking for a black credit card. Our server and the manager did some investigating as well. No luck. They did find a credit card at the hostess stand but it didn't belong to my Dad, which was actually less comforting at that point.  Eventually our meal was comp'd but the manager never spoke to us and the server just gave up looking. There was an exchange of contact information in case the card was found, but my Dad canceled his card ASAP and never did hear back from the restaurant.   Mistakes happen, that's to be expected anywhere. How it was handled (aka customer service) wasn't so great."}
{"text":"I'm vegetarian and the black bean and sweet potato tacos were good. Not over the top good, but good nonetheless.  Chips and dips brought to the table were good, but the \"chips\" were  tostada shells that you had to break apart, which was weird.  Service and ambiance were great, but only 3 stars for the ok food, which was overpriced (even for Scottsdale) and forgettable."}
{"text":"This is an incredible place to gather with friends, have margaritas and everything on the menu is fantastic!"}
{"text":"We had a party of 10. They're very busy (good sign) and were able to get us in with one day notice. We had a variety of dishes. Major highlights were the fish tacos, the Vampiro, the chile relleno, the carnitas street tacos, shrimp tacos, short rib tacos. Service was excellent and we am were all commenting on how we were excited to return. We highly recommend SOL Mexican Cocina. Do the specialty tacos!"}
{"text":"As my daughter was about to drink her glass of water - she noticed a bolt/screw in the bottom of her water glass! What was the worst part of this --- our waiter, each time he showed up at our table, was blaming my daughter for putting a screw in her glass. He said, how many more bolts do you have in your pockets? I get it--I can see where you can find the humor in this situation -  but it got to the point where he was obnoxious on blaming her - which ruined our lunch. The final straw was when he removed her plate of food from the table, and even took her fork searching for more bolts - saying \"is there anymore in here?\" Wow--really??? WE DID NOT PUT A SCREW IN OUR WATER?! It was rude and uncalled for.   We loved our guacamole! We split a delicious steak burrito steak. The steak was cut into small pieces and was just not enough of it for the price. We had house marg and pineapple and couldn't tell the difference in flavor.  We ate here April 5 2017, for lunch on the patio, our waiter was male, had brown hair and glasses.   Yah - we got \"screwed\" .... !"}
{"text":"Was in town visiting family over the holidays and we went to SOL for the first time; so great!! It was brunch time so I ordered a mango mimosa and the crab and shrimp eggs benedict. The food was different and such a nice change from the typical tex mex I am used to having. Everyone that I was with loved SOL and their food!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing evening with my husband while visiting Scottsdale. We were looking for a unique, nice restaurant and ended up choosing SOL. We're SO glad that we did. First of all it's in a really cool location, but also on a somewhat busy road. We sat outside, and were seated quickly on a Friday night.   We started with the $5 house margaritas using the Yelp deal. They were tasty. Then we got some chips, salsa and beans complementary. The beans were a pleasant surprise. Then we ordered the coconut calamari. It was honestly hard to pick which appetizer to choose...they all sounded amazing.   So the coconut calamari was probably the best fried calamari we've ever had. It was huge, and perfectly crispy but not overly oily or anything. And the sauce was a spicy lime sauce I think? It was sooo amazing. I'd highly recommend this appetizer over anything else here just because it was so good.   For the main course, I ordered the fish dish, this time it was a Grouper fish covered in crusted almonds on top of a bed of this corn soupy thing. It was seriously amazing. It was also so different than anything that I'd ever ordered at a Mexican restaurant which is exactly what I was going for. The corn soup thing was like full corn kernels in this creamy salsa ish soup. Yeah it was awesome.   He ordered the carne asada burrito. It was also really good, he couldn't even finish the whole dish because there was so much food. He loved the meat and the flavors in the burrito.   Overall this place has the portions of your classic Mexican restaurant but literally everything is homemade including all of the 20+ sauces. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"They are always busy so  if you don't make a reservation it's quite possible that you will have to wait a while.  They have a good food.Not the best but good.  Pricing is okay too but when compared with food that you get there price could be cheaper."}
{"text":"Yep, A-OK. I guess I had high expectations with the hopes it would be up to par with the Mission in Old Town Scottsdale. Not even close. The tortilla soup I ordered was nothing to write home about. The guacamole was just OK and the tostado chips were cold and not very easy to break which was too bad because their salsa was really tasty. They should consider chips that are easier to dip into that yummy salsa. I would have given this place 2 stars but the salsa was good and their Jalapeno cucumber margarita were both really good. I will probably come back just for the margaritas."}
{"text":"Here for taco Tuesday and it's delicious -- Shrimp tacos are my favorite and the skinny margarita is so refreshing ! Great service by Alberto !! We will be back :)"}
{"text":"I made reservations for an inside table, they sat us outside.  We requested inside and there was an attitude.  Maybe they were trying to help us out because inside was about the same temp. As outdoors, but it wasn't pleasant.   Our waitress was attentive, but the food was pretty mediocre.  I will say that my drink was very good....but the food...meh."}
{"text":"Tonight was my third time coming to Sol Cocina. Each time the service has been so good and spot on! It really makes for a quite enjoyable experience. The food was so fresh and full of flavor! We had the ceviche Sol as well as several tacos. The taco vampiro is definitely my favorite as well as the jalapeño margarita! Overall I highly recommend this restaurant  I haven't had this good of service and level of attentiveness even on a busy friday in a long time!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars!  My friend and I ordered the SOL Guacamole and their fish tacos at $7.95 eah! I love their fish tacos! They are fresh, flavorful and tasty! I will admit though, earlier I made my own guacamole. The guacamole I made was from an organic avocado with fresh diced roma tomatoes and chopped onions. Maybe it is all in my mind, but I did not feel that the guacamole was organic or fresh at SOL. Maybe I was expecting it to be more flavorful? The chips they had were fresh though and I felt healthier than most. I would definitely come back to eat the tacos though!"}
{"text":"I had the shrimp Chile relleno and my husband had the Kobe steak. Both excellent. Had a couple margaritas that were also very good. Our server Eric was very helpful and helped us choose the churro for dessert. Overall an awesome experience. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Excellent food at fair prices.   One of our favorite restaurants in Scottsdale!!"}
{"text":"The food here has been top notch every time. Not a place to grab a quick bite, but the atmosphere and food are worth it. Pricing is right in line with most other sit-down Mexican restaurants.  Their chorizo cheese dip is great and so are the Tortas."}
{"text":"Was in Scottsdale with my wife on our vacation and Sol was recommended to us.  Nice live music and a very crowded dining room during happy hour... overall it was solid mexican fare with nothing that was overly great.... Basic fare at a fun place."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Service was very slow. They seemed to be understaffed and the bar was severely backed up."}
{"text":"First time visiting, Sunday afternoon lunch. Very pretty restaurant, with unique decorating inside and out. They had a guitarist/mandolin player doing a solo set which gave a nice ambiance. We had their special 'Sol' guac which was tasty, and more than enough for two - avocado, tequila, mango, etc. A specialty taco and a burrito plate for the entree. Everything was fresh and delicious. Even their table chips were high quality and the salsa/bean dip was a nice compliment. Also sampled a house margarita - nice and strong. Friendly staff that helped us with the menu and showed us their shelf of tequilas above the bar. Price was a medium, but it's in Scottsdale Quarter so it should be expected to cost a bit. Would recommend and return."}
{"text":"Sweet potato and black bean taco is a must try! I'm a meat lover but the flavor is amazing!"}
{"text":"The comp. salsa and been dip with tostadas was a fun and tasty way to greet us at the table.   Excellent guac with unexpected ingredients like pepitas and goat cheese - delicious!  We're not big into rice/beans so the ala carte tacos options were perfect for us. Each one was packed full of flavor and really, really tasty. Be prepared to spend $30 on 3 tacos (if you like the steak/shrimp options like we do).   Dark Chocolate Banana Bread Pudding was just OK, nothing to brag about and I would not order it again.   Overall, a fun twist on Mexican cuisine with some traditional and unique ingredients.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Love this place. Best tacos I have ever had. I definitely recommend it to those who are taco lovers."}
{"text":"I had lunch at SOL with a coworker last week. It was ok. The staff was very friendly and overall service was perfectly acceptable. The vibe of the restaurant is very trendy and upscale. They start you off with chips, salsa and bean dip. The chips were weird and tasted burnt almost, but the salsa and bean dip were good enough to cover that funky taste. I had the Eggplant Torta and my coworker had the Carne Asada tacos. My sandwich was good, I would order it again as long as the grease level went down a notch. The side salad was boring as all get out. The $11 price tag seemed reasonable since it was a large portion.  My poor coworker...$15 for 3 tiny dried up tacos that didn't even taste decent. He was really unhappy with his meal.  We had high hopes for SOL, unfortunately it just didn't measure up. Bummer."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant twice in one week. I must say first the atmosphere is awesome! I love the casual environment. The service was a ten both times. The food is amazing! Everything from the wild fish to the carne Assad tacos to the coleslaw! Delicious!! Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Coconut Calamari which is large chucks of meat.  Almost the size of fish sticks!  Delicious and different.  I also love the fish tacos and goat cheese dish.  Not your typical Mexican food......Great food, staff, and location."}
{"text":"What a great find in Scottsdale!  The tacos are creative, well-prepared, and delicious. I had the short rib and blue corn, along with the sweet potato and black bean tacos. Superb!  The staff is super friendly and knowledgeable. Park in the free garage next door."}
{"text":"Used the yelp $5 off coupon for a Don Juilo margaritta. It was ok- very tart (as the waiter described) not my favorite. I had the duck taco. Presentation of the duck was very nice however it had 3 slices of avocado, raw onion, a lime and orange slice which was very disappointing. It is supposed to be a taco.. why not put  some type of slaw on the side, maybe a unique salsa?? The duck was very tasty but the 'side' item was poor. Would not order it again."}
{"text":"Only tiny tiny issue - if you ask for a patio table via Yelp you most likely will not get one. I was advised at check in that you have to call."}
{"text":"We had a lovely experience on Saturday night...My boyfriend had been here before, I had not.  The server (Rodrigo?) thanked him for bringing me. Server was so friendly, informative, and helpful with my choice.  I had the hot and raw ceviche...Off the chain....Bf had the chicken salad with Avocado vinegarette that he loved and looked delish. Margarita was delish, and the Mexican chocolate cookie dessert was light and lovely.  Will be going back for sure.. oh oh oh...and the music was perfect... Thank you for a wonderful night.."}
{"text":"This place gets five stars for service. The hostess and bartender were really nice, and our server, Leah, was over the top. We took forever to order because we were so busy talking and happy to see each other we didn't look at the menu for awhile, but she was great about it. My tortllla soup and fish taco were excellent. She also brought us complimentary dessert because we were celebrating a birthday and engagement. The noise level in the restaurant is low enough that you can have a normal conversation and the decor is really relaxing. Prices are reasonable. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Dined at SOL for lunch with my mother on a Saturday, and was pleased to discover brunch was available.  Armando was our server, and he was very attentive, friendly and made great recommendations to accommodate my food restrictions.  I had the skinny margarita for $5 for checking in on Yelp.  Warm chips, delicious bean dip and a very tasty fresh salsa were a great start while we leisurely read the entire menu.  We shared the naked guacamole, which was a portion perfect for two.  Mom ordered the crab cake Benedict, with eggs poached firm.  This was a beautiful dish to behold, and she really enjoyed the flavors and crispy bacon.  I considered brunch but then decided on the carne asada taco plate with rice and spicy slaw.  The carne was cooked to order, clearly not made ahead, and the steak bites were still pink inside.  Very tender and flavorful, the 3 taco portion was impressive when compared with the tiny tacos at an un-named Mexican restaurant in nearby Kierland Commons.  The rice was as expected, but the slaw was delectable, with pepitas mixed in and a tangy spicy bite.  We thoroughly enjoyed this meal, and proclaimed we would return!"}
{"text":"This place was very good.  Great bar with half inside and half outside.   Friendly service and overall great meal.  Try the classic azul margarita.   I had the grilled burrito and it was very good.  Came with a spiced Cole slaw and it was spicy.  They can really hear it up if you want them to.  Salsa was very good.  Bean dip was ok but I am not a big fan of bean dip in general.  Parking is right next to this place.  Very convenient.   I would definitely go back and may end being a staple when in this area."}
{"text":"The service was slow and the food was cold.  The servers are Always rude. Tried a few times and won't go back"}
{"text":"If your visiting from another state, try harder for a good Mexican food experience.  I love the Quarter but this place does not represent great Mexican food and or service.  I went with four friends to celebrate National Margarita Day!  The food is over priced and worse yet, it wasn't hot. Service was nice but sloooooow.  We all ordered the same margarita twice and the second one was remarkably different than the first.  The waiter wrote it off to a \"different bartender.\"  So...... there are different recipes depending on who makes it?  Good thing Starbucks doesn't operate this way or they would be out of business.  A $13 margarita should be kick ass.  These were not!  So... if you want overpriced mediocre food and drink with nice but slow service, this is your place.  I'm not sure if you can recommend places in comments but try Dick's Hideaway, Barrio Café, heck, even a little dive restaurant!  Oh, I and I hear the Mission is good.  We will try that next time!"}
{"text":"This place just keeps getting better.  Their Kobe steak is awesome and their tacos & ceviches are absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"This is now my favorite Scottsdale area restaurant. I loved the unique takes on Mexican with atypical dishes and combinations. Great service and a nice atmosphere as well."}
{"text":"This has been the single worst experience at a restaurant ever. If I could, I would give them a zero star.  1. We were told we had a 50 minute wait when it ended up being 15. We went out of our way to come over here and they couldn't even estimate our wait time correctly.  2. While we were waiting we got some drinks at the bar. When our table opened up, the bartender acted like we couldn't transfer our bill to our table and tried to charge me for all of our party's drinks.  3. We ordered the sol guacamole and ceviche. The sol guacamole was disgusting and we switched it out for the naked. The ceviche never came.  4. When we sat down we asked for extra salsa and black bean dip. Never came.  5. We ordered several tacos since it was taco tuesday. My friend who lives in Phoenix raved about this place and couldn't even eat her sweet potato and black bean tacos. Another friend literally threw up less than 10 minutes after starting eating the Vampiro/Butternut Squash.  6. Another person of our group wanted sour cream. It came out warm, runny, and gross.  7. Our waiter took our order and left us. Another person who was delivering food had to give us more water and give us the sour cream. Our waiter only ever came to check on us after we asked for the manager. That really shows how much he cared about our service.  All in all, I do not recommend this restaurant. I mean, unless you like throwing up."}
{"text":"I am a taco connoisseur, with that being said Sol in the Scottsdale quarter is amazing. Let me start with the service. Arnaldo was easily in the top 3 servers I've ever had at any restaurant... Carmen at Sol is in there as well. When I first came here I ordered a bunch of tacos easily 15 and said no cilantro at all. With my request he did it and the tacos basically came plain. He then saw the upset look on my face and told me how their sauces were made with cilantro and he wanted to make sure I wasn't allergic. Once I told him it was OK he came back with all the sauces and made them table side and explained every one perfectly and they were delicious. Kudos to Arnaldo. Carmen has always put a smile on and has recommended great apps and is just an overall great server and a pleasure. Oh and now they both recognize me when I come in. THE FOOD... To die for. From apps to specialty tacos even down to the street tacos for taco Tuesday. The dessert... LA Guera is addicting and I usually get one to go. (Also the banana chocolate bread pudding)  Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"I sat at the outside bar for drinks with my friend while visiting AZ. I ordered a beer Margarita...Was a little confused why the margarita and the beer came separately but whatever....The atmosphere was good, corporate/higher management was obviously visiting while we were there, they were circling the restaurant and asked us if we were okay a million times. But the weather was beautiful and we got to enjoy chips and salsa with our Drinks, so it was a good visit overall."}
{"text":"We came here tonight for dinner. We had Alberto as our server, and he was great! I had the chicken grilled burrito, YUM!! Also, the qeuso appetizer and the Yelp check-in skinny margaritas were very good. We'll definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"Came to Sol Mexican Cocina expecting great Mexican food but while is not bad it is not the best either. Had the chicken fajita torta and it was ok, could have had more flavor and seasoning. The service was very good and the ambiance is nice. The burritos are so big that are not as appetizing as they could be. Giant does not mean better in my humble opinion, as long as they are flavor full they can be a bit smaller. I will come back and try it one more time."}
{"text":"Mexican with a little bit of flare. Got the short rib taco which was excellent.  The price was over $10 so I said to the guy that must be one big taco.   Actually it wasnt.  Bigger than those from Taco Bell but certainly not the biggee I was thinking I was getting for thy price. Worth the experience."}
{"text":"I'm surprised how difficult it is to get a good margarita in Scottsdale but I finally found it at Sol. Don't want sour mix? No problem! Fresh fruit? Done. Some different? How about basil?  The good is also very good. We had chips, guacamole, shrimp tacos, quesadillas, pulled pork burritos. All good.   Great vibe / energy as well."}
{"text":"The service was great but their food was just ok. I enjoyed my tacos and loved their quinoa salad. I tried making a reservation through Yelp but the restaurant didn't have my reservation, not sure if the systems are sinked. Despite not having the reservation was seated right away."}
{"text":"Prices are a bit expensive; however I had the shrimp burrito and WOW you get a lot of food and sides with it. Well filling and very tasty. I have heard the tacos are the best from multiple people and intend to try those next."}
{"text":"Really love this place.  Came in for a late lunch a few weeks ago and shared a plethora of tasty mexican goodness.  Started out with the seasoned tostadas + accoutrements of black beans, salsa, hot sauce, salt, lime.  Yum! The Hot and Raw Ceviche was impressive as well as delicious!  They have just the right acid/fruit mix going on. It comes in a giant glass with sweet potato and beet chips which are equally as delectable.  We also ordered the Street Taco Flight.  Make sure you sprinkle some of the salt, lime, and hot sauce on them.  It makes them so much better!   The greatest thing is you don't feel like you just ate a ton of bricks when eating here. Everything is really fresh and light and refreshing.   Even the chocolate bread pudding was really good.    I'll be back to try more!"}
{"text":"I have eaten hear several times. The food has always been very good as well as the service. This place is good for large parties. I brought company out of town guests over 10 people and they accommodated us nicely. My husband and I were there just the two of us and it was equally enjoyable. We'll return"}
{"text":"I'm in town for a business meeting and came here from all the great reviews. We had the BEST service! Thank you Beto!!! food was amazing and the atmosphere was  great! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"I am a Mexican Food snob. This place was phenomenal!!! Damn, I might have move to Scottsdale just to eat here every week! The guacamole with Mango and Goat cheese was some of the best I ever had. The shrimp tacos were great too. Fabulous atmosphere and impeccable service. Great place for date night. You gotta try this place!"}
{"text":"It's hard to believe it's taken me this long to try and review SOL. I am not much of a happy hour guy but SOL happens to be listed in the top ten places for happy hour in Scottsdale which piqued my interest.  The decor and ambiance are great with light music and very attentive service. I started with a frozen strawberry margarita which was delicious and included fresh strawberry pulp and puree. The menu is quite extensive and varied but only one item caught my attention for consumption: the duck carnanita, a scrumptious deep fried duck leg confit served with three small corn tortilas enough to make three of your own little tacos accompanied by a blackberry sauce, chopped onions and avocado...it was truly a mini feast...and enough to warrant ordering a second one !  The finish ? as brilliant as the rest: a banana bread dark chocolate bread pudding with cinnamon crema and freshly made whipped cream...enough was enough well maybe not I was naughty enough to wander off the premises after signing off our check to go grab a small latte a Press coffee down the street !  Overall, I was very impressed with SOL and it was my very first time tasting Chef Deborah Schneider's cuisine and I must say she is truly a master of her craft !"}
{"text":"I have been coming to SOL for about three years now on and I don't know how I've never tried the Fish Taco Gobernador before!!!! It is sold a la carte, and it's well worth it. This taco has wild-caught fish, pan-roasted with lemon & garlic, on a taco dorado with cheese, salsa gobernador, avocado, onion & cilantro, pico & lettuce.   If you love fish tacos, you're missing out if you don't try this one.   The atmosphere at SOL is intimate, low lighting, live music at times. Great to catch up with family, friends, or a nice date night. They've really thought out the decor and design of the place. One of my faves.   They also have great Taco Tuesday options and pricing if you're on a budget."}
{"text":"Definitely not impressed. We stopped in for lunch on a Saturday. The weather was not too bad because of sprinkling so, we sat on the patio. Mistake! Our server was slow and lazy. She took our drink order, pushing the sangria and margaritas. After dropping off lots chips and little salsa, she disappeared for 20 min.  She returned after I stuck my head in the dining room, only to tell us they were out of the red sangria but could make me a white. (#1 how do you run out of sangria in the middle of the day, in a Mexican restaurant, when you're NOT busy and you were pushing it special and #2 if you can 'make' me a white sangria, why not a 'red'?). So, I played along. Mistake #2. It was terrible.   We ran out of salsa rather quickly and while I had her at the table I asked for more. She returned with another basket full of chips, but no salsa. When I reminded her what I asked for (and what we did not) she said \"oh, someone will be bringing it right behind me.\" Seriously?  We ordered the carnita tacos and Ensenada fish tacos. Food was average at best. Fish tacos were just ok. Pulled pork was cold. Rice was dry. And so was the experience.   We won't be back."}
{"text":"Sol is located right off Scottsdale road.  The service is super friendly and speedy.  The restaurant is a modern version of Mexican food with a twist. The corn appetizer was amazing.  The carne tacos were tasty, I wasn't a huge fan of the tortillas so ate the meat only.  The tortilla chips are Sols own version."}
{"text":"Been there only three times. Always happy. Food and experience is amazing. I love to get the Strawberry Margarita there because they make it with real strawberry chunks. It's like having Luxury Mexican food. Highest quality you can ever get. Yummy. A must try place."}
{"text":"Alberto was an amazing server! I love this place! Can't wait to come here every Thursday. Also a stunning atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The happy hour here is awesome, and the chips and salsa are addicting! Great ambience, a perfect place for a girls night!"}
{"text":"Yum! First time visiting this restaurant.  I tried their grilled chicken burrito \"wet style\".  Love the presentation with the grill marks and the flavors of the dish! Will definitely have to make the drive back up here again.   The black bean dip is great along with the large chips they make fresh."}
{"text":"During a recent trip to the area my boyfriend and I had no idea what would be good but we both wanted Mexican food and this spot looked good so we decided to eat there. The restaurant itself was spacious but not cavernous and was attractively decorated. The hostess was sweet and our server Joel was excellent. They served black beans instead of salsa with the chips which were v delicious. We ordered shrimp taquitos, quesadillas, and one of the specialty tacos as well as a watermelon margarita. Everything was suuuuper good and the service was outstanding."}
{"text":"Came in during waste management, but it wasn't that busy.  We sat at the bar, ordered some apps & drinks.  I usually don't even think about doing a dine & dash, but we totally could have, and I don't think anyone would have noticed.  No bueno."}
{"text":"Ordered the steak tacos, received absolutely nothing that I ordered. Went there with a large group, two others did not receive what they ordered. Had to get the girlfriend shake shack on the way back to the hotel. Strawberry Margarita was HORRIBLE. Place is garbage. Find another Mexican restaurant, place is horrible."}
{"text":"I had the Carne asada torta and it was delicious. Not a big fan of their full tostada sized chips but the sandwich was bomb dot com worthy of the 5 stars."}
{"text":"Had high hopes when we saw this place,  but what a disappointment.   The gray-haired gentleman that seated us (I believe was possibly the owner or manager) was very blah...no smile,  no greeting,  no eye contact.   Food was below average.   The thick cut tortilla chips tasted stale and the salsa was bland.   I ordered steak tacos and my wife ordered fish tacos.   Both were lacking in taste.   Our kids' carne asada tacos and cheese quesadilla off the kids menu were better than our entrees.   The only good part of our experience was our pleasant and attentive waitress.  Due to the tasteless food and impolite host/manager/owner(?),  we will not return."}
{"text":"OK, so look: just come here. You'll be happy.  Sometimes there's a long wait. Sometimes there isn't.  Last visit arrival after 9 p.m. They close at 10. No stress visible from anyone as we were being seated. Prompt attention from server. Killer house marg for $5 thanks to Yelp check-in.  Solid performance on the chili verde and carnitas burrito. Very good guac that isn't complicated with stuff that should never be mixed in.  Consistent performer for years and years including their Newport Beach location."}
{"text":"Hey Guys ... the food is GREAT! Service is good too. Be aware that it Is reallly reallly REALLLLLLLLLY loud inside so if its not too hot and the weather is nice go outside away from the ruckus (Wu Tang Clan Brings the Ruckus).  Grab a margarita, mojito or a bottle of patron and let the fiesta bless ya. This place is classy with a good vibe and a quality (But pricy) menu.  Phenomenal Traditional guacamole! thoguh Im not sure what happened when i ordered the Sol Guacamole, the guac came with like pineapples and other strange condiments mixed, in. It wasn't bad but it was a bit overkill and cost extra.  down one star because i didnt have my sombrero, but ill be taking a siesta under the nearest palo verde after dinner at this place. the Fish tacos do the trick. Spice up the guacamole and tacos with a little lime and hot sauce and give your tastebuds the mariachi march to heaven.  Muy Sabrosa!  As far as servers go, beard guy is cool and speedy Gonzales is great. Baldy mcBig head annoyed me a bit for standing too close and ignoring me.  The chip n salsa guy is quick and attentive. But the water re fillers seem to be conserving due to the recent drought.  Getting the check on time is always a problem here. I know the atmosphere is chill but don't keep your guests waiting."}
{"text":"I've tried ceviche all over the world and never had any as good as the \"hot and raw\" ceviche at Sol Cocina. The rest of the menu is hit-or-miss, but the ceviche is truly world class."}
{"text":"The first time we came here was in August and if I would have written a review based on that visit, I would have given them 1 star for the poor service that we received.  I called and spoke with the manager after that visit and he apologized and offered to send me a gift card to have us come back and try his restaurant again.  We went again last night, different server, and the service was much better.  The salsa and bean dip they bring out with the tostada chips is heavenly.  Their guac appetizer is pretty good.  Their tacos are to die for.  Both times I've gotten the street tacos and I have not been disappointed.  There is so much flavor in their food and everything is really fresh.  Their Mexican rice is super amazing too.  I would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"This review is just fr the bar...  I wasn't a fan...  Overpriced drinks... Didn't seem like a \"real\" Mexican cocina iny way at all...  Zero reason to go back with all of the other great choices in the area..."}
{"text":"First of all I love their location. They are located in the middle of all my favorite stores. But the food here is great. They do happy hour 7 days a week. Service is excellent. The corn is a must try. The place is also very new and hip."}
{"text":"I have been all over USA and this is the best Mexican Spanish  the best, Taste amazing everyone is so friendly here. Enjoy your food guys,Ciao"}
{"text":"So I would give their strawberry margarita a 5 stars alone !!!! It's was so delicious and refreshing. I will for sure be back even if just for drinks. As far as service and food quality is was just ok nothing great not bad but I was expecting to be wowed !!! Based off recommendations from reviews and friends. Our server was friendly but think she may have just been over run with tables because we hardly saw her. They brought out the wrong sides for my dishes not once but twice. Again not her fault she didn't make them and other severs where bringing them out. Will return and try to make their happy hour because the prices seem more reasonable :) but you must try the Margaritas !!!! Beautiful atmosphere and decor was nice."}
{"text":"We have been to SOL six times in this past year. The food is good but, overpriced for the size portions served. However, the service ranges from poor to average. They have NO systems for a server to know they have a table. They really operated with a very inexperienced small staff. Not great value!"}
{"text":"OMG the Mexican food at this place is to DIE FOR! My husband got the enchiladas and it was the best as well as all the other food we ordered- also all the food tasted authentic which was a plus. We will be coming back :)"}
{"text":"This place was the bomb! Stopped here after getting into town, and boy were we hungry. We were seated after a very short wait. The environment is casual and the decor is warm feeling. We were greeted by a nice waiter, and given some delicious black bean dip that would make you smack someone's momma for it. Fresh corn tortillas were baked for us to chip away into our own bite size peices. The menu is fresh, and unique but not so much you can't pick an item off the menu with ease. The infusion of flavors was great.   We chose the tacos and you must try: Ths sweet potato taco The crunchy shrimp taco The carne asada taco The yellowtail taco  All of these were cheap, and you can get a few different ones to try out. Two will fill you up but three will take you over the hill!  My only issue was the lack of ability to have options that did not have garlic in the foods or marinades. Don't come here if you need accommodations.  This is a great place to get some authentic food."}
{"text":"Had the luxury of attending a NCA event in the private dining area of SOL. It was on a Tuesday night, I arrived a little early, so I was able to sit at the bar and check out their Taco Tuesday menu + order a drink. They have an extensive list of imported beers, more than I am typically used to.   Location: Its right in the Scottsdale Quarter and located right next door to the parking garage, so its a short walk from the car to the restaurant entrance, extremely convenient.   Ambiance: I like the low lighting and the openness of this place. They have an indoor/outdoor bar and a great private dining area for corporate events, private dinners, etc. Also, the high top tables are great, and the lounge area outside with the heaters! Superb.   Employees: All very friendly, especially the bartenders, who made sure my drink was always full and made sure I was taken care of. Extra plus, theyre all attractive. eye candy for the win.   Food: The TACOS! So delicious. I had the steak and chicken tacos, with their extra spicy sauce. So delicious. I love that they make your guac from scratch, so everything is extremely fresh tasting. Plus, how do you go wrong on a taco tuesday? 2 street tacos for 2.50! You're full after 5 dollars.   Make sure you use the check-in offer, its 5 dollars off any margarita, wonderful.  Did I mention the live music on Tuesdays? Super legit. Its acoustic and not like a mariatchi band. I appreciate that."}
{"text":"Went with my family. Had heard great things about this place and it's all true. Very friendly and attentive staff. Food was terrific starting from the huge tortilla chips with bean dip. Ordered the grilled burrito and it was very flavorful. All the ingredients tasted fresh bursting with flavor. Will be our go to spot when in North Scottsdale from now on!"}
{"text":"Food was okay. Drinks were average.  There was an hour and a half wait and I put myself on the wait list and sat at at bar outside.   Restaurant emptied out and I never got notified that my table was ready.   As I was leaving I stopped by the hostess stand to ask why I never was notified that tables had opened up.   She initially indicated she had text me.  When I asked what number she had on file for me she stumbled and said we probably had the wrong number down.   What was even cuter was both hostesses giggled as I walked away.  Mediocracy at its best..."}
{"text":"Nice, casual ambience. Not too casual, not too fancy. Our server was friendly and helpful. The chips and salsa were great. 2 salsas (one mild and one spicy) and the chips were seasoned homemade tostadas. I had an absolutely perfect blended margarita with fresh strawberries and sugar around the rim! For an appetizer, we had the ceviche. At first, I thought it wasn't much, but it was definitely plenty. Delicious and fresh. For dinner I chose 3 tacos, the quesotaco, poblano, mushroom and corn, and the bufalada taco. All 3 were so good, but my favorite was the poblano, mushroom and corn. So good! Crunchy, greasy, tasty...like a fancier version of what my mom would make! I didn't get the entree, with the rice and beans, but the tacos alone were plenty! Based on what we ordered, I would recommend Sol for authentic Mexican food with a slightly fancier flare!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like SOL Cocina, but for me it was a big misfire.  I know, I know they've only been open 9 days, but there were rookie errors that should never have occurred with an experience restauranteur or issue that a soft opening should have handled.  We wanted to try this new restaurant for our friend's birthday, so I diligently made reservations a day in advance (they are not yet set up on open table).  We arrived on time, but they weren't ready.  They tried to set us up on a bar table, but we wanted a regular table which we had to stand and wait for 30 minutes.  The three hostesses blamed the problem on a failed computer system, but there seemed to be plenty of tables and they just wouldn't seat us, because they said the computer problem messed up their ordering system.  After waiting a half hour I finally demanded they seat us and take our order the old-fashioned way -- by hand.  To their credit, the restaurant decor is lovely.  The tables a beautiful real wood rustic hand-hewn tables.  The indoor/outdoor vibe is great for this time of year.  But they do have an issue in the bar area with the direction their tables are set up.  All the tables are set up in an east/west direction so when the sun sets you are literally blinded by the sun.  A simple solution would be to turn the tables to that they face north/south.  Also, once the sun set the restaurant goes to dark, soft lighting.  Not unusual for a restaurant, but with the poor lighting and the thin font on the menu, it is nearly impossible to read the menu.  Come prepared -- bring a flashlight and reading glasses because you'll need them.  On to food and drinks.  The appetizers were really good.  We had the Guacamole Sol which was good, but the Warm Goat Cheese appetizer was really outstanding.  I can't say the same for my husband's drink.  The waiter recommended the Grande Clase Azul Margarita.  We like margaritas, but we did not like the taste of this one which was more of a case of quantity not quality.  It was strong -- super strong, but all you tasted was tequila and very little of the margarita flavor that we know and love.  On to dinner, my husband and I ordered the Grilled Fish Zarandeado.  In my opinion very average and not much flavor.  Plus it was very wet below the tortilla so when I went to pick the taco up to eat it, the whole thing fell apart.  The rice was okay, but the black beans were really not to my liking.  All together and even with the sauces the flavors were very bland.  Which was extremely surprising for Mexican food.  One kind of tends to expect spicy and flavorful food.  However, our friend had the sweet potato black bean taco and she liked it a lot.  Lastly on to service.  While our waiter was nice and a dedicated educator about all the menu items, service was very slow.  We had brought in a specialty cake for our friend's birthday which they very graciously served.  We all promptly ordered coffee to go with the cake.  20 minutes later we were still staring at our cake waiting for coffee.  We finally called the waiter over and asked about the coffee and he said they were out of coffee and it would take another 5-10 minutes to make some more.  We promptly ate our cake without coffee and cancelled the order.  To the waiter's credit, he brought us 4 cups of coffee right before we were  gathering our stuff to leave and said the manager would comp the coffee, but by this time it was 9pm and we were ready to leave.   Interestingly, our original reservation was for 6:30 and we didn't leave until after 9pm.  We like long and leisurely dining when it is our choice, not when it's because of slow service, computer problems, etc.  I know the restaurant is only 8 days old, but it may be 8 months before we give it another try.  Hopefully, by then, they will have worked out all their problems."}
{"text":"Everyone loves Mexican food... SOL adds $cottsdale class. Culinary perfection meets an atmosphere so chill you can show up in shorts & flip flops. The manager Carlos is so friendly & attentive you'll believe its his home and you've been invited to a VIP dinner party. (Ask for him) #ArizonaGem"}
{"text":"Excellent Baja-style Mexican food. Our server, Veronica, was incredibly knowledgeable and accommodating. I have extensive food allergies and she was able to answer all of my questions about ingredients. It is obvious she loves what she does and is passionate about being a part of SOL. THE FOOD WAS OUTSTANDING. We would recommend this place to anyone and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My hubby and I had lunch here over the holidays.  I couldn't wait to try this spot after reading the reviews.  We had a decent lunch-but nothing I would return for.  They are generous with the chips, salsa and bean dip.  How I long for the days of HOT, freshly salted chips.  These were not-sigh.  I had the queso with mushrooms and chorizo-almost too spicy.  My hubby had the Carne Asada Tacos.  It appears they have a more limited menu at Lunch-perhaps I would have enjoyed the Dinner menu better."}
{"text":"I had a really good dinner with some friends here recently.  We had their chile appetizer - which is a cheese-stuff chile wrapped in bacon and grilled.  It was so good that I got one with my dinner.  The chips are great - some spicy salt they put on them that gives it a good flavor.  We all ended up getting tacos - chicken, carne asada and carnitas - all on their Taco Tuesday special.  The portions were just big enough to fill you up without feeling too full.  The carne asada tacos had a really good flavor.    I had the watermelon margarita and a pineapple margarita - both were good although not very strong at all.    The service was good although we did ask for some grilled jalapenos and had to ask about them several times before they finally brought them.    I would definitely return to Sol."}
{"text":"Solid Yelp home run.  Had the carne asada taco platter and it was great.  Taste of the grilling really came out.  Nice outdoor area that would be nice if it wasn't 150 deg out."}
{"text":"Aside from the great menu the staff are very professional and friendly. Made my wife very \"At Home\" during our visit."}
{"text":"Ate out on the outdoor patio last Friday night. The food, atmosphere and service were superb! Enjoyed the eggplant taco and guacamole fresco. Thanks Arnoldo!"}
{"text":"The food here is incredible! Desert nachos are to die for and I live for the black bean dip! It just seems to have pretty spotty service, from have an inattentive server or just plain rude. But overall the atmosphere is fun and the food and drinks are great!"}
{"text":"SOL had a great veggie burrito bowl, with plenty of mushroom and avocado - mmm! I liked that they serve the  rice on the side side. We also tried sweet potato tacos, mushroom tacos, and the corn. The corn wasn't that good compared to other places so I would pass on that, but otherwise SOL seems fairly solid, at least for vegetarian dishes. The staff were also quick and helpful when we came in pretty close to kitchen closing, which I appreciated."}
{"text":"Terrible service and time estimate on table availability. Said 40 mins and waited 1.5 hours. Many tables sitting empty. Not worth the wait."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of this restaurant, even on their less-than-perfect days.  Let me start by saying that everything I've had is fantastic.  In particular, the ceviche is absolutely incredible!  So are the carnitas (pork) street tacos.  And don't forget the margaritas!  Only one time have I had an unfortunate experience with my food.  I'm not writing this to complain about the food, I'm writing to compliment them on how they handled it.  After I explained the situation to our server, he immediately sought out the General Manager who came straight to our table.  He immediately rectified the situation, offered to replace it, and took the item off our check.  That is what good service is all about!  I was very nice about the incident - I don't believe yelling and screaming are appropriate ways to handle things - and as a result everyone went out of their way to look out for us the rest of the evening.  Classy service and style all the way around!"}
{"text":"I was here again tonight, with my family. Great food and service. Debbie, our sever was amazing and very attentive. The best experience we've had thus far. In fact, we took tons of leftovers home. SOL, you're phenomenal!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for date night last night for our first time and had an amazing experience! Everything from our drinks to our food was absolutely to die for. The ribeye tacos were the best tacos I have ever had. We had the nachos dulces for dessert and were in heaven. The ambiance was perfect for date night. Our server, Giovanny, made the experience that more enjoyable. He knew exactly what to recommend and was very attentive. We are definitely coming back again!!"}
{"text":"Sol Mexican Cocina is a definite go to for lunch when shopping at the quarter. My server Marlena was really sweet and on top of things. There were loads of wait staff on hand to see to our needs. For instance Beth was so knowledgeable and explained many items on the menu making it easy for me to make a great selection. I had some kind of fish tacos with salad and guacamole. Yummy!! The best. Next a fellow came over to refill my coffee. He said he was going to make a fresh pot that would only take a few minutes. Turns out that was Matt and the coffee was delicious. I really loved the ambience and not feeling rushed at Sol MC. Thank you to everyone. It's so evident that you love what you do. We benefit!!"}
{"text":"We discovered Sol Cocina last February when we came out to Scottsdale for a short getaway and LOVED it. We came back to Phoenix this week and knew we had to come back.   First the food was incredible. Creative pairings and unique tastes to everything, make this a wonderful  experience that is not  your typical Mexican restaurant. The soup was so good, the grilled corn was unbelievably good (still craving more of that) and everything we ordered was delicious.  Most importantly was the service we had from Leah. She was friendly and welcoming from the moment we sat down and made this a great dining experience that will have to hold us until we return to Phoenix again."}
{"text":"First time coming here in quite some time, and the service was amazing! Our servers name was Alberto and he was very welcoming and gave me and my sister excellent service even though the restaurant was packed. Although they no longer offer the Chicken viper taco, I will definitely be coming here again soon. The food was great and the banana bread pudding was to die for. Definitely leaving this place with a full belly that's for sure."}
{"text":"Amazing food, with a new take on Mexican. Everything was fresh, delicious, and left us wanting more... Too bad our stomach capacity limits us! We will return ASAP. And the Mexican Sweet Corn, WOW."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place as it is my favorite Mexican restaurant in north Scottsdale. I have been here many times for either lunch, happy hour, or dinner. Every time, service is very attentive and food tasty.   They have a really good lunch menu and happy hour. I consistently get the carnitas street taco meal with 3 tacos and rice. Their guacamole sol is another favorite made with mango, tomatoes, onions, goat cheese, pepitas. Fantastic. And the chips, salsa, and black bean dip? Fugeddaboutit.   I have had other dishes, some just okay, and others very good. The items I love keep me coming back for more..."}
{"text":"Decent, fresh, unique.   The salsa is great, but stays with you for a long time. I've had the fish tacos and a torta. Both were good.   The location is great, service good."}
{"text":"Food is awesome, but the service sucks (especially the hostesses).  Their street tacos are my personal favorite there.  We really like most of the varieties we've tasted and they have good meat/vegetarian options.  We also like their guacamole a lot.  It's especially nice that the guac is served with homemade large chips.  I also recommend the calamari appetizer.  If you're a calamari fan - it's really great and unlike other calamari I've tasted.  The service is what keeps them from getting a \"5 star\" from us.  Their hostesses (on 3 different occasions) are snooty and cold.  They seem 'bothered' that they are there to help anyone walking in the door and they act like their seating us at the most exclusive club in town instead of a nice neighborhood Mexican spot.  They need to hire some host staff who are genuinely warm and friendly - it would make a BIG difference in people's willingness to wait for a table instead of walking away.  The servers are mixed.  I've had a couple that were awesome - and a couple that were forgetful and slow.  But they've all been friendly.  LOVE the food...  hoping they perfect the service."}
{"text":"Fun place to come and get some authentic coastal Baja California Mexican food. Which means they do a lot more  of  seafood  and other dishes rather than northern Sonoran food which is the taco burrito base that most are use to also known as Tex Mex.They have great happy hour specials on both food and drink, Plus  live music some nights of the week. Also is located in the Scottsdale quarter which has lots of great shopping restaurants and bars to choose from. Definitely should come by and check it out"}
{"text":"The food is good.  where this place falls down is with the the service.  Our waitress acted like she'd was doing us a favor that she would not rather be doing.  I asked if they served plain black or green iced tea, no added flavors.  She replied, \"No, I will bring you some water\" and turned and walked away.  No I'm sorry or asking if I'd like an alternative.  Unfortunate, this type of crappy service has been the norm on the 3 times I've been there. The food is really deserving of a 4 (minus the fact that you can't get unflavored iced tea - what is the deal with that?).  However, the put upon attitude of the wait staff is a real problem."}
{"text":"Great food! My family loved it and we would recommend it to you. They had very good chips, salsa and guacamole,"}
{"text":"This restaurant was pretty good. The ambience was modern yet cozy. I had the Kobe beef, which was delicious. My husband had the pork tacos,which unfortunately on the dry side. Our server Israel was wonderful and very attentive to all our needs."}
{"text":"I love that Sol offers a Mexican brunch but I'm a little disappointed in the quality of food. Chilaquiles were underwhelming - too chewy instead of crunchy with too little queso. I got mine with carnitas, which were too greasy for my taste. No kids items on the brunch menu so my daughter got the 3 eggs, bacon & potatoes from the adult menu. Her eggs were so overcooked, she only had one bite. Her potatoes were super greasy. No shredded chicken on the menu - only sliced chicken breast.  The good stuff: I loved the black bean dip, served to every table as a starter with chips and salsa. Cool, hip decor. Tons of tequilas available. Fun brunch cocktails on the menu. Very friendly service."}
{"text":"Only 2 small Vegan options. Shame. There are so many people who won't eat animal ingredients if it health or compassion reasons. But in this restaurant they don't care.  Update: April 3. Anthony. E. I believe is one of the restaurant owners or the chef (maybe not), send me messages that I'm \"bitchin\" for no reason.  Well. I promise.  If the restaurant will change their menu to have more Vegan compatible dishes Ill canch my rating. It's the easiest thing in the world to do that. It's not even a challenge.  It supposed to be prepared to order. Isn't it? Instead of chicken or beef put some tofu. Insted of Chicken powder use Vegetable powder. Insted of Lard use vegetable shortening.... But if the chef is arrogant and his decision to be loyal to animal ingredients more to his loyalty to his costumers... in that case one star is too much !  I truly believe they wont. I truly believe they don't care. I came with friends after I made sure they have vegan option. Drove half an hour. Paid for valet.  And stayed hungry."}
{"text":"Sweet potato tacos and the mushroom & pepper tacos were quite good.  Soups were tasty as well, and we liked the sample size portion that is an option.  Our margaritas were flavorful but a bit pricey.  Wish they had draft beer."}
{"text":"The food is lux Mex so it's great on ambience and service. The environment trumps the food taste but it still gets 4 stars. We're spoiled here with a lot of great tasting Mexican."}
{"text":"Excellent margaritas, service, and delicious street tacos!"}
{"text":"I'd like to say this is our New Mexican go to place since my Boo loves Mexican food and making the hike to Barrio Queen is a chore.  But alas, not so much.  The Margarita was just ok.  I can't rate the  food since I'm allergic to onion and every single dish is pre made  with onion?! ...and per the manager, they couldn't make anything fresh?"}
{"text":"This has quickly become a go-to lunch spot for us when we head down to Scottsdale.  My wife loves the Cerviche, but I'm stuck on the Tacos ala carte.  Beware of the Viper -- it will light your fire!  Good 'ritas, good chips/salsa and good food!  Lovely patio dining on the nice spring afternoons.  It's just what the doctor ordered for Mexican food starved Prescott residents!"}
{"text":"So we went for Happy Hour to give this place a try. The hostess said martinis were on happy hour, the our server said they were not. The server proceeded to bring us the saltiest salsa we've ever had. When ask if it's always that salty, our server said yes that's the norm. I ordered Dos Tacos for $5, one pork and one chicken off the happy hour menu. I got 4 tacos and was charged $10. I asked for salsa verde, and our server said they didn't carry it. I asked the gentleman who brought our food and he said yes they had it, but then he never brought it. Then I asked our server again about salsa verde and she said it was a $2 up charge. I think what makes this a 1 star is the fact no one can get their story straight, the chips were horrible, and the salsa was almost inedible. As a Mexican restaurant, I'm a bit concerned they can't get salsa and chips right. The tacos were okay. However great people watching, just bring a flash light because it's super dark."}
{"text":"Great outdoor bar.... and the skinny high end margaritas are great, that along with the full tostada style chips with beans and salsa.   A great way to start off the any meal.  Even tho out in Scottsdale and not like its sister site off Jamboree and PCH in Newport Beach, still the Ceviche Kicks butt major... a for sure recommendation.  As for the tacos, well did the fish battered ones... lets just say, no frills no thrills.  Overall good experience and staff pretty attentive."}
{"text":"Great food, I had Baja corn chowder with crab , really good! the carnita street taco very good too, I also had a green pepper filled with cheese..  wasn't to crazy about it, and my Bloody Mary really bad.. services was ok, but a really nice environment, I recommended but don't ask for bloody merry drink."}
{"text":"I wish I'd gotten the waiter's name. He was incredible. The drinks were 'well balanced,' i.e. not watered down.  I got the naked guacamole. It was super bland but I mixed the salsa in and it was better.  Also got the shrimp tacos and they were great. The rice was overcooked but whatever.  I wouldn't recommend it to friends but I'm not upset about the experience. The waiter made the experience good even though the food was nothing to write home about.  Beyond the food, my other complaint is seating.  The raised seat limits my parents and my in-laws from attending."}
{"text":"Overall - definitely avoid if you're going on a date - might be okay for a group if you guys are into chain-like restaurants and don't care about quality food or drinks.   In regards to the food and drink (1) Beware the Calamari - unless you are in the mood for fish sticks, then by all means, enjoy! (2) And I'm sorry, but since when did using a sour mix (house-made or otherwise) for margaritas become something work advertising? Their drinks were cloyingly sweet and syrupy and a far cry from anything remotely authentic. (3) Then there was the guacamole - maybe the standard version was better, but we were highly encouraged to try their specialty guacamole which had goat cheese in it. I love goat cheese, and I LOVE guacamole, but I couldn't really see how the flavors would work together. Just like I had thought, the flavors made a rather disastrous marriage - but beyond the sad mismatch, the flavor was down right bland (even after adding salt & their special spicy sauce, it just tasted like mush). (4) And while the concept of the tortilla rounds was cool, they failed again to execute (they chips were stale & flavorless, not crispy & lightly salted like authentic chips should be).   The atmosphere is loud and upon settling into it, mostly unimpressive - the lighting is dim (which I normally don't have a problem with, but their tables are a size that makes it awkward for two people to see each and have an easy to understand conversation).   This place misses the mark on so many levels it's straight up sad."}
{"text":"To start the nachos and salsa you get to start are amazing!  House margarita made with Patron!   I had two tacos, short rib with blue corn tortilla...get it, you will not be disappointed. Also had the vampiro taco which was spicy and so favorable.  Bartender Devin was great super nice and great recommendations!   I wish I lived closer to go every week!"}
{"text":"We tried Sol for the first time last night and it was EXCELLENT.  The watermelon margarita was easily the best I've ever had and their carne asada street tacos were divine.  Mmmm my mouth is watering just thinking of it. My husband had the viper and vampiro tacos and loved every bite.  Service was great. Overall, a fantastic experience. We will definitely be going again soon."}
{"text":"This restaurant is nothing more than a glorified and expensive taco bell."}
{"text":"Weird how food so bland must have been salty as I've been downing water as though I have been lost out in the Sahara desert for the last hour since we arrived home. I had their short rib with tortillas and baby serving of onions, cheese accompaniments. The salsa was bland and boring, not the slightest bit sweet or seasoned. Chips were not flavorful either. The queso dip ended up a hard, dried cheese ala mozzarella sticks after 15 minutes. The corn tortillas were dry and unflavored. My daughter's carnitas tacos tasted gamey. I am not sure what type of Mexican restaurant this is supposed to be but our money would have been better spent and tastebuds better satisfied at Blue Agave or Rubios."}
{"text":"Perfect location within the Scottsdale Quarters and a nice outdoor seating space. We arrived at a perfect time for their happy hour and enjoyed some house margaritas. Ordered the Carne Assad's Torta and was very impressed, especially with the freshness of the bread."}
