{"text":"I have an Italian background and make my own eggplant parm. This place makes their eggplant just like my grandmother. I order the eggplant on its own with the bun on the side and it's amazing!! You can get extra sauce and toppings at no charge  I also recommend the veal sandwich however you may want to ask for extra sauce on your sandwich.  I am such a regular you can call your orders in advance and they will be ready for pick up One of my favourite places especially for a quick bite after finishing work!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place for a Friday lunch,and was severely disappointed. I ordered a veal and a meatball sandwich.I sat and waited for half an hour,while customers that ordered after me got their sandwiches. After I asked the lady what was the holdup ,she told me that the meatballs were frozen and they were getting thawed out. I told her that if I knew I was going to wait 40 minutes for a sandwich l would have left. Never going back."}
{"text":"I crave this place on a regular basis.  Their sandwiches are huge and delicious. They have extremely friendly staff, and food is always ready quickly. From mini-pizzas, to delicious pastas, this is some of the best home-style Italian food that Vaughan/Woodbridge has to offer.  My favourite: Veal parm sandwich."}
{"text":"I ventured outside my normal lunch area today and headed north to Woodbridge.   I stopped for a quick bite and grab a veal sandwich with rapini. About $8 and charge, which is about average for a veal sandwich. The sandwich was mammoth. Huge slices of veal. Unfortunately, the sandwich was lacking sauce and flavour; it was a bit too tart for my liking. The veal was also chewy. The rapini was average, it was missing that garlicky flavour.  The bread was a bit to crusty as well.   Overall, their veal sandwich was sub-par to the other veal sandwiches I have tried.   They had other non-sandwich items on their menu. Lunch specials starting at $3.50. Maybe another drive up to Woodbridge for lunch in the near future."}
{"text":"Whilst running errands near the Interchange 30 plaza today (Hwy 7 and 400) I got a hunger on and following my last stop a block or to East I found myself parked near the Walmart staring at several options for lunch. After a quick scan through Yelp reviews I avoided the near by Mexican spot (thanks to Faye for the tip) and decided on some Italian comfort food compliments of Via Panini!  As my earlier Mobile tip stated, there is nothing but older Italian ladies working here, so you know whatever is to come is fantastic! Most of the crowd here (and there was a crowd) takes orders to go, but a few of us who know better, stayed and enjoyed our food hot and unwrapped.  I decided on testing the Veal sandwich waters here. As many of you know when it comes to Italian food I am fiercely loyal to those who do things great and it would take a lot for me to turn my back on my main veal squeeze - California Sandwiches. The verdict:   Hot Peppers: Barely there Veal: Thinner pieces but packed Bun: Held together well Cheese: FREE Rapini: Slightly overcooked for my tastes  Now, I should clarify, when it comes to Veal on a bun, I am a snob so to the average person this is a fantastic sandwich, even better than many I've had at sister locations of California Sandwiches BUT by my standards it is a 3 star which is A-OK!!!   No because gluttony loves company I followed this up with a Rice ball. I was impressed because it was formed, cooked and served to order. Nothing pre-made about this. The sauce was very tasty, albeit a touch watery. And the filling was ooy gooey and yummy! This portion of the meal gets a 4 star in my books, definitely a superior Rice Ball (oh ya and it was the size of a softball)!  This spot has a ton of lunch specials, so for now I'll leave this review at a 3 star and see how other menus items will improve their overall rating. In my honest opinion, definitely a place to come check out!  Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches for the price.  Good amount of toppings.  Nice that they have specials (usually pastas) for each day too.  I had a veal sandwich and will definitely be coming back to try other sandwiches.  It's a small place with little seating, but probably sufficient given that most customers are near by office workers."}
{"text":"If you are hankering for a great veal or chicken Panini, Italian style, Via Panini is a great little restaurant to visit. Family run, the sandwiches are huge so we generally get one to share and compliment the sandwich with Ragu rice balls. We tried the lasagna and it is very good as well."}
{"text":"Gotta be some of the best Veal I ever had. Surprised they make their own pastas here too. Nabbed a bag. Good value for lunch as well. Great portions!"}
{"text":"Well, I have to say it was a great veal panini, but the lady serving who appeared to be the owner was not friendly or inviting.  On top of it was the very basic and you have to make sure you ask if you want a whole wheat bun, nothing is ever offered.  I requested hot peppers a got a tiny, I mean tiny like 1/4 tsp of crushed jalape√±o that seabed like it was such an inconvenience."}
{"text":"I got the meatball sandwich. I was expecting there to be actual meatballs on the sandwich but it was a slab of meat that looked like meatloaf. The taste did not remind me of meatballs either.. In my opinion it just was not that great of a sandwich. Maybe the other choices are better but I do not recommend the meatball sandwich at all.   The only reason why I am giving this place 3 stars is because how good the rice balls were. I have never had rice balls and they were pretty delicious.  The service was great and the people were very nice that were working there."}
{"text":"This place is a little difficult to find but was recommended by a friend and had to see what he was raving about. I've been here a couple of times now and I would definitely come by here if I'm in the area.  I've had the chicken sandwich, rice ball with tomato sauce and the wife has always gotten the ravoli with tomato sauce. Everything is pretty good and would not hesitate to venture further into the menu the next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Been coming here for their grilled chicken sandwich for years.  Very authentic Italian place, the ladies even take a break and eat their own concoction. They are always nice and welcoming, I just wish they would open on Sunday."}
{"text":"After all these years, the cash lady still cannot be pleasant for just a second.  (- 1 s t a r ) In plain sight leaving out the cheese topping. c h e a p a s s  (- 1 s t a r ) Not cleaning tables when no customers are around while she's free."}
{"text":"It's great for a quick lunch but just average food and prices.   The veal and chicken are good but I find more bread and less meat. It's still very good if you want that meal (subway is your next choice beside)   Service 5-5   Food 3/5   Price /3/5    That is all. Ow now brown cow.   -"}
{"text":"This strip mall restaurant is a family owned business. The quality is always top notch and they do a great job. We mostly feed the family with a takeout order and it's always been a easy experience.  If you have a hankering for a Hot Veal on a bun the you can do no wrong  Mangia"}
{"text":"Thank you, Via Panini, your pasta special gave me a cheap lunch, every sunday before my dialyisis. Lets get the somewhat bad out of the way, shall we, the customer service, not super friendly, but not rude either, just pleasant, but they have rectified this by hiring more enthusiastic cashiers. Cheese and other small dressings, you have to pay extra for, and they give you a very small amount. Okay now the good, let's start with my favourite dish, the pasta special, usually comes with a large bowl of penne, drenched with their famous, mouth-watering, drink it like juice when the pasta is done, Tomatoe sauce. It was, very cheap, started at 3.50, then over the months, went up to 5.50, now I believe it's 7.50, it's sad, and I understand, but it's just not worth getting the pasta special anymore. That's because ordering your own choice of pasta and sauce, is now practically the same price, their alfredo sauce is rich, and creamy, delicious with their cheese rotini, and their meat sauce is the regular sauce, but with beef, you can't go wrong. Garfield would have a field day here, not only do they have fresh lasagna, they also carry frozen take home portions, ranging from one person to party size. Let me talk about the massive, jucy, delicious salty balls, rice balls, that is, they are a cheesy amazing mess, you order one and it can feed two people, well worth the price. Now, the sandwiches, I'm going to say it, way better than California Sandwiches, in my opinion, the sauce is better, and the meat is juicer, flavorful and beautifully tender, now my wife would disagree with me, she loves cali's, but if you want something different, with great taste, and more options than just sandwiches, and a sauce that is only rivaled by our own, Via Panini's is were it's at."}
{"text":"The veals are good and the toppings are free.  The way only problem is the lady at the cash. If they replaced her, the place would be great.  Too bad they won't because she is one of the owners.  Good paninis and nice breading on the veals."}
{"text":"Very nice place lunch spot. They have different specials every day (usually it's either veal or different types of pasta). Very good salads and you can add any type of protein to it. Pasta is always fresh and tastes good. And of course most importantly very pleasant people."}
{"text":"Excellent veal sandwich. Nice and Filling, free toppings( unless you want rapini that is $1.50) fast friendly service. For two cans of pop, and 2  veal sandwiches it came to $23 , very reasonable. I will come back here again  !!!!"}
{"text":"Best panini! The service was good. The cash lady was sweet enough to help me with mt order. The chicken is delicious. Reccomend. Came back for a big tray of Alfredo Penne!!!! sooo good! Many friends loved it.. Lasagna is delicious. I like to ordee for big parties."}
{"text":"Delicious veal sandwich. Possibly the best one I've ever had. Mmmmm."}
{"text":"You know, I have been coming here so often in the past few months, and they are ruder each time. I thought they were decent, but after coming in and having them ignore you when you come through the front doors, waiting patiently, they are in the back, I say excuse me and they are like \"what do you want?\". Ummm an order? Then I call in and they seem annoyed at the very fact that I want to make an order for pickup. Then they say they are not by Kipling and Hwy 7 but by Woodstream and Hwy 7... They are right there! So tired of the rudeness and bad service. I'll bring my money to California sandwiches from now on. They care about their customers."}
{"text":"I came here out of the blue and it was pretty good.  The panini is pretty big but it gets pricey. Service can be quick.  overall I'd say this is a good place for a quick bite.    They also have some pre cooked frozen Italian pasta which is excellent for a house party,  but I don't think they advertise it well."}
{"text":"This new establishment is located in the heart of Woodbridge in a newly built building and adds variety to the fast food options .   I ordered the veal culet with cheese and mushrooms at no extra charge. The sandwich came to under $8 and came out quick. Soft bun, good amounts of cheese and a tasty veal."}
{"text":"The veal sandwich ($7) at Via Panini is huge....   This is one of those time I wish I have someone to share that with..  I ended up just eating the meat and just half the bun.   The staffs are really nice and cheerful.  Great if you are in the area and just want to grab a bite.  CP 24 showing the latest news kept me updated."}
{"text":"very happy to come here for lunch the other day, and funny enough I just drove by and gave it a shot out of the blue...not knowing what I wanted to eat for lunch...the setting is very intimate, with a few tables and a very dimly lit setting. the service is absolutely fantastic, the pricing is excellent, and the portions are a good size...even better with the daily combo's they have. everything is made fresh to order to the point when you eat the food it makes you feel like you're in a dream. lunchtime gets a bit hectic, I find the customers get a bit rude and cut the line. a really Great feature about this place is that it has frozen portions to go, with a platter of lasagna and other delicious goodies. with a smile on all of the workers faces, the quality of food, and the service to match, this is a gem of a place to come and check out."}
