{"text":"If you love seafood, Salmon Dave's is the best restaurant in all of Cleveland.  Their salmon is exquisite.  It melts in your mouth and ithe ginger sauce that it came with was delicious.  It did not overpower the taste of the fish filet, but added to the flavor.  I also enjoy their shrimp and scallop dishes.

But what really separates Dave's from other restaurants is their risoto.  I grew up on risoto, an italian rice dish.  I love it, my children love it and my grandchildren love.  To me the risoto at Salmon Dave's is the best I have ever eaten, even better than the risoto my made.  So I suggest that when you go to dinner there, make sure you have one of their risotos as a side dish."}
{"text":"Was really looking forward to our lunch here and some fresh, delicious fish. Unfortunately, that never happened.
We came for a late lunch on a Tuesday. They were very understaffed, as our waitress was also the hostess and bartender. She was inattentive and got many parts of our order wrong, however our food took so long rather than send it back we all dealt with it. I will say she didn't write our order down when she took it which irritates me, because that is obviously the reason it was SO WRONG. I also asked for bread shortly after we sat down to which she replied \"I'll bring it with the appetizers\" which ended up being 20 minutes later. When a customer asks for bread, you should bring it THEN.
Our food was mediocre. For starters our table had a Cesar salad, minestrone soup, and lobster bisque (which they are \"known\" for). It was decent but I've had much better. It also came out mildly warm, not anywhere near the temperature one expects soup to be at. Disappointing.
Our entrees showed up eventually (the wait was too long, especially since there was only one other table in the restaurant being served, who we also overheard complaining about how long the food was taking). Our table had the salmon, a salmon salad, and the crusted cod. All were ok, although the cod was VERY salty and I wouldn't order it again. I was not impressed by the really oily cream sauce that was drenching every inch of the plate either. Not happy.
Our waitress didn't even offer dessert and just brought the check, which was weird. That's okay though because from what we had experienced so far it was a definite pass for all of us. 
Oh well, still gotta get my fish fix!"}
{"text":"Always have a great experience here!! Love the bar staff (I always sit at the bar because they are so friendly and fun to talk to. Their food and drink knowledge is on point). I've never been let down by this restaurant!!! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Sounded like a great place from reviews. Walked in with our young child for a bite to eat for lunch. Essentially was kicked out by a 20-something manager due to the bar area being \"unsafe for children\". That would make sense at 12am, not 12pm when we walked in. If you're a restaurant looking to over charge for day old seafood from the \"Pacific\", then don't call yourselves \"Salmon Dave's\" and attempt to be upscale in Cleveland, OH."}
{"text":"Came here with my wife, mom, and sister for my sister's 21st birthday. Our server (Justin) was very friendly and helpful. Fun fact: my sister's favorite cake is carrot cake, and Dave's doesn't have that. So what'd they do to get her a birthday cake? They went to Heinen's to get a slice of carrot cake for her, which is awesome. The food was good, the restaurant was clean, and the service was all friendly. Aces."}
{"text":"Great lunch and dinner restaurant .
The daily specials are always worth checking out.
Dinner time gets busy so reservations recommended."}
{"text":"Everything you get here is delicious. Obsessed with the Lobster bisque. Went here once by chance and have been driving from east side of Cleveland every since. It's worth the trip."}
{"text":"Reliable. Dependable. Good quality ingredients & good service. Nothing special. I think the prices are accurate for what you receive. This is a great place for a business lunch, or for a non event dinner with your spouse. I would save special occasions for a place with a little more flair and creativity."}
{"text":"I made reservations for my friends birthday for the famous Maine event. They had no openings but after confirming with  previously made reservations they had an opening for our party of 8.. the earlier party was an hour late in their arrival so we waited an hour. In the interim another 8 top opened up but they refused to seat us even after we waited an hour and spent $100 at the bar!!! REALLY!!! They refused to seat us in the open 8 top.. I'm disgusted with how they handled the situation.. we left and ate elsewhere.."}
{"text":"This place avoids a perfect rating for one reason: too expensive.  There's not a plate in the place that comes in under $20.  

That being said, this place is nice and laid back, the bar area is especially great for bringing a few friends and chewing the fat in a comfortable setting.  Nice exposed brick, dark wood for the chairs and tables.  Minimal gaudy stuff on the wall.  

The service was great, even during a somewhat busy Sunday evening.  

And the food is good.  Very good in fact.  But for the portion size and not being great, it can't justify charging so much for an entree.  Either up the serving size, or better yet, bring the prices down by about $5 a plate and this is the perfect seafood place."}
{"text":"Salmon Dave's is all right. The dinner and lunch menus are pretty okay. Can you see that I'm not so enthusiastic? We just got back from their \"happy hour\". You can get three \"bites\" of happy hour stuff for $5.00. Yes, that is very reasonably priced. but, no, the food was not good. I would rather pay more and get something edible. We had a chicken tempura (blah), a veggie pizza(undercooked), and some bar-B-cue meatballs(extremely bread-crumby). All marginal. And we ordered a full price bottle of wine. There was nobody in there. It just seems like they're on auto pilot. We used to go to Salmon Dave's a lot for lunch. We like to sit at the bar. The bartenders were friendly and the food was edible. There is some kind of a pall over the place now. What is it? No original soups. The same old everything."}
{"text":"Fantastic place to go! The best lobster bisque in Cleveland and top notch service."}
{"text":"Well, any decent seafood place that isn't located on an ocean is going to be expensive. The price isn't unexpected, but what you GET for the price here is definitely disappointing. The menu was sparse. I love seafood, but dislike shrimp. Most of the seafood options were polluted with shrimp. Two of us both got soups for appetizers. I love, love, love lobster bisque. Love. Salmon Dave's \"award-winning\" lobster bisque broke my heart.. It is literally as thick as paste, and so full of cream that was all I could taste. The crab corn chowder was decent. My entree was an Alaskan salmon special with mashed potatoes and broccoli. The salmon was decent, the broccoli a bit undercooked. The mashed potatoes... obviously instant. They were gritty, gluey, and off-flavored. They were also an odd beige shade, I don't know how that happens, ever. Neither me nor my companion ate any of them after the first bite. Of course, since nobody came around to ask about our meal, we couldn't tell anyone. I couldn't get the displeasing taste out of my mouth. I drank some of my beer to try to wash it out, but my beer was served to me incredibly warm. So was my companion's. I guess they're trying to cut cooling costs so they can keep the dining area a frigid 65 degrees. Poor decision, because it tastes... funny. I wouldn't have ordered a second, even if I'd been asked. I'm new to Cleveland, so I don't know what other seafood options there are, but I would suggest looking into one of them."}
{"text":"The food here was so good and I'm giving it 5 stars because of the amazing happy hour prices and the quality of the food. I had lobster risotto, shrimp and a burger here and a few cocktails. Everything was really reasonably priced and the service was great. We sat in the bar area. I'm excited to go back and sit in the dining area too. Their menu changes semi-regularly from what I can tell online which I also like.  I'm definitely going back to this place."}
{"text":"Visited Salmon Dave's for a pre-graduation family get together.  Lots of different tastes and preferences and the menu satisfied everyone.  Good seafood considering this is Cleveland and Copper River Salmon was even offered which was surprising.

Service was good and the atmospere very cozy.  Even though I wasn't paying the bill, I thought it was a little pricey but has a good reputation and we will return."}
{"text":"I went here with high hopes, as I like this group's other restaurants, and the menu looked great. My wife and I both had lobster bisque and it was not to our liking; it was the consistency of thick yogurt. Our meal was delivered the minute the soup was cleared. I had the halibut. The fish was good but the fingerling potatoes were barely cooked. My wife had the lobster pasta, which was good. The whole meal was extremely rushed, pushed out in less than an hour for a Friday night dinner. Not the experience I would recommend for a $100 for two people (without alcohol)."}
{"text":"We were here in Rocky River from Los Angeles for a family reunion and looked for a nice place to take our son who recently moved here.  We're foodies, we admit, and appreciate good food and service.  We received both here.  We arrived at 7:30 on a Sunday evening and it was a bit noisy at first, but that just turned out to be the boisterous group next to us who soon left, leaving us in peace.  

Lobster bisque can be hit or miss.  The worst I've ever had was in Boston, but this is supposed to be the specialty so we took a chance.  Excellent.  Creamy, layered with flavor, and filled with large chunks of honest-to-goodness tender lobster.  Main course was the cedar plank salmon, very tasty, mild, and expensive cut of fish done to perfection.  We paired that with a very nice Ferrari-Carrano chardonnay and lingered over the meal. My wife is very gluten-sensitive, so we split the flour-less chocolate torte and it was sublime. She's now asking when we can go back.

Service was excellent, the decor very attractive, overall a delightful way to spend an evening.  Not what we expected on a trip back to the Midwest town I left 50 years ago when Beardens was haute cuisine.  As to price, our son has been telling us how inexpensive everything is in Cleveland, but this shocked me.  Cost for the meal for the three of us was quite a bit less than half of what we'd pay for the equivalent in California.  If you can get meals like that anytime you want, without waiting weeks for a reservation, at those prices, then I envy you.  Great meal, great service, and an excellent value to boot.  We'll be back on our next trip."}
{"text":"The best happy hour. Great salmon salad and drink prices. Dining room is a bit stuffy, but the bar is great. Definitely an older crowd, but a nice spot to have a good meal every once in a while."}
{"text":"Salmon Dave's was really really good. The potatoes took the chicken Marsala to a whole nother level, and the salad dressing that came with the house salad (which was wrapped in a cucumber) was amazing! It was a Chardonnay honey vinaigrette !"}
{"text":"I feel obligated to write a review.  My wife and I were regulars here until somewhere around 2011- Mardi Gras time.  I absolutely loved their food and the bar area (THE place to sit for ambiance) is extremely warm and inviting.  Normally their Mardi Gras menu is awesome- but we notice the Bourbon street shrimp were totally different and not very good.  So we guessed the chef had changed...and not for the better.  In particular the seafood has been cooked poorly almost every time I've gone in.  We have resorted to only going for some wine and appetizers (blackened scallops are still pretty good) when we used to go in at least once per week.  

I'm hoping someone from management there will read this and make some changes to get things back to normal.  They also own a newer place in Hudson that is very good, so perhaps the chef went there.  

Let me clarify- it is NOT a bad restaurant, it just lost its edge with us.  You can not beat the service or ambiance though- we still have a soft spot for it."}
{"text":"This review is mainly for the bar/appetizers. I joined 3 friends for drinks at the bar this past Friday around 6:30 and to our surprise we were able to find 4 seats at the bar. 

I believe our bartender was Randy, he was great. 

The food was amazing, I cannot wait to go back to enjoy one of the main dish's.    

We had the appetizer platter and 2 orders of the ahi tuna, the tuna was the best I ever ate, melt in your mouth with just enough flavor. I can't wait to update when we go back for a full dinner."}
{"text":"A nice meet-up spot with a decidedly \"pub\" atmosphere.  All in our party had different seafood entrees and all were done nicely with adequate portions.  However the high prices did not fit with the very high noise level or casual feel of the place.  At the prices they charge, one should expect a gentle, comfortable dining experience where one can converse with ease."}
{"text":"What started out with a difficult beginning finished with a nice outcome and a good meal.  My wife and I took another couple (on a Sunday night) out for Salmon Dave's famous New England Lobster Bake.  I had previously made an early dinner reservation (5pm) to ensure a good table and give us plenty of time for a leisurely meal.

We arrived promptly at 5:00pm and were informed that our table was yet to be ready.  At 5:30pm we were still waiting and were finally ushered to our seats...at a hightop table...in the bar.  None of us were pleased with this development and let our hostess know.  Unfortunately, there were no other tables available so this was basically our only choice.  Luckily, a general manager soon came over to discuss the situation with us and quickly apologized and attempted to make amends.  The appetizer platter they brought out to us seemed like more than fair compensation, and the various options on the plate were all delicious and unique (lobster rangoons, fried calamari and salmon cakes).

As we sipped our drinks, out came a bowl of warm bread accompanied by a sweet, creamy honey butter spread.  This helped tide us over until...the feast arrived!

Each lobster bake dish came stuffed with corn on the cob, fried potato wedges, steamed mussels, an entire half of a rotisserie chicken and a whole Maine lobster (with drawn butter, of course).  A \"boneyard\" basket was placed at the center of out table, and animal instincts took over as we each tore into the crustacean.  It takes a lot of patiance (and a little know how) to get through an entire lobster without missing out on some of the hidden places to find meat, but growing up in South Florida I was able to guide my table mates through the process.  Of course, most of us left a good portion of their chicken untouched, but they made for tasty leftovers in the coming days,

This meal was a really primal, fun, unique experience (especially for Cleveland) and i'm glad we were able to finally try this well known spot."}
{"text":"I took my mom here for her Birthday this week. When she requested Seafood I was over the moon since I have been wanting to try Salmon Dave's for a while and this seemed like the perfect opportunity. 

I wasn't sure what to expect with the goofy pumpkin display in the window but stepping inside it was a very cozy and quaint. The decor is classy with a little bit of old world rustic. They have a great wine selection that is reasonably priced. Our waiter was very professional and kind.

After taking our order they brought out bread and butter. This was no ordinary butter, it had a subtle sweetness that was top notch. My mother got the Lobster bisque and said it was some of the best she's had. She ended up with their Fire grilled Salmon for dinner and I the Crab crusted swordfish. Neither dishes disappointed, both were flavor and delicious.

To both my mother's and mine surprise they brought out a special surprise Birthday Creme Brûlée. Neither my mom nor I had Creme brûlée before but found this dish tasty.

My only complaint of the evening was it seemed to be a slower night as there were only a few tables in the restaurant yet we had some trouble tracking down staff to box up the decedent remains of our dessert.

All in all this is a great seafood stop for any lover of fish or crustaceans."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was nice, our waiter was nice the food was not great but good. We ordered tempura calamari and oysters as appetizer. Filet mignon and stuffed lobster for dinner. The raw oysters was fresh and the appetizer was good. I had better steaks and the lobster was over cooked because I was very chowy and tough.  I would deffinely go there every weekend for some drinks and some oysters if it was closer to me."}
{"text":"The lobster bisque was excellent.    I had the cedar plank salmon and my wife had the seafood Szechuan lo main.   Both dinners were excellent.    We didn't have reservations on a Friday night but were seated immediately.   It's a bit pricy but we'll be back for a special occasion I'm sure."}
{"text":"Danielle has been wanting to go to Salmon Dave's for as long as I've known her. Friday was her birthday so I made reservations and took her and I'm happy to report that she loved it. in fact, we both really liked it.

While i found Ricky's (our server) spiel to be a little pretentious (ex. \"Chef this and Chef that\"), he did a fine job and the food was delicious. 

Danielle had the Pan Roasted Salmon w/ the lobster and chive risotto - which was incredible, by the way. She did, however, think the sauce was unnecessary. 

I had the Coleman Farms Chicken. It was kinda like Chicken Marsala but with a maple flavored sauce and was absolutely great. My only gripe was the chicken itself seemed as if it might not have been seasoned. Not a big deal and I'd definitely order it again. 

Danielle also had some Creme Brulee for dessert - also quite good. 

Some might wonder about the dress code. I admit i did and their website wasn't much help. So, I threw on some clothes I'd wear to work. It was fine. It was a special occasion so dressing nicely was fine. However, others were dressed more comfortably in shorts and whatnot. If it helps, I took a picture of the sign on their front door. Now I know for the next time."}
{"text":"One of the two must visit restaurants when I'm in Cleveland (the other being Moosehead Saloon).

Consisntently good across the entrees (I've had the Salmon every way they prepare it - all good) but if you like spice, the blackened scallop appetizer is the best!"}
{"text":"dinner on a week night with the husband could not have gotten any better,  cruised the Metro Park to get there, our server Sheri was great, her manager was great, our meals, gumbo, walleye and Chipino were great,.
Look forward to the next time."}
{"text":"Exceptional service.  Lobster bisque was creamy, warm, savory and overall delicious.  King crab Sunday special was also well cooked, and notably quality seafood.  We arrived without reservations, were seated in a cozy booth and simply enjoyed a good meal with a great margarita or two.  Will be back for sure!  Expectations well met."}
{"text":"Went here for our anniversary dinner. Love the happy hour on M-F, 3-7pm with $4 cocktails and $1 Jumbo Cocktail Shrimp! We got there at 6, Happy Hour'd and then ate dinner at 7. The Lobster Bisque was tasty, but included a very small cup with barely a tasting of actual lobster for $7. I had the Crab Crusted Salmon and my wife had a steak. Both meals were delicious and reasonably priced for the quality and atmosphere! They even brought us a free Creme Brule for our anniversary dinner!

I decided to take 1 star off for mediocre service. In general, the service seemed to forget about our small table for the bigger ones. After the hostess didn't have our table ready 15 minutes after our reservation, we waited a while before our server checked in. Then, the server forgot few times of what we ordered and even the manager ran us the wrong food at one point. I also never like when a server offers you a soup or salad as if it's included, but then charges you extra for it. Regardless, none of this compromised our meal or experience! We will definitely be back for Happy Hour and possibly dinner!"}
{"text":"A spot that pleases hubby and me. I can dress up he can be casual and neither of us look out of place. We have never been disappointed with the food.have been fortunate enough to try a variety of menu items as well as nightly specials never disappointed. WISH THEY WOULD MAKE THEIR CREMe BRULEE to order and serve it warm,hate when it comes out refrigerator cold or it's been nuked.What I think makes the dinner pricey are the drinks but that seems to  be the trend these days. Love the waitstaff who most seem to have been here a while always a good sign and even when busy which has been everytime we have been even during the week service is attentive without hovering. One suggestion get rid of the runners or leave them a table arrangement ticket so they don't have to hold up the plates and call out the ingredients like they were at an auction...my only complaint but I REALLY HATE THAT!"}
{"text":"My wife and a friend of ours stumbled into Salmon Dave's by accident, and what a happy accident it was! 

The atmosphere of Salmon Dave's is wonderful, warm and classy with a very attractive, well stocked bar, not to mention that there doesn't seem to be a bad seat in the house. 

You could come in casual or dressy and not feel out of place. The foods, from the wonderful soups (I can't recommend the Bisque enough,) to the appetizers to the never-empty bread bowl and the wonderful entrees are just amazing. There was nothing there that, to me, was less than great. The service was great and we felt welcome from the moment we walked in the door. 

The price range is what you'd expect from such a class place, but not too extravagant. If you want to not only impress, but enjoy great food and a great atmosphere, check this out-of-the-way spot out for some of the best."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch with a friend... I could LIVE on the lobster rolls. So so good. Also, randomly, the bread and butter are also delicious! Great beer selection. Awesome service.

Went back for dinner w my husband. Crab legs were great. Salmon was okay. Service was not great. But, I was a server so I know how it is when you're busy so I tried to cut him some slack.

Decor is fun and not too stuffy.

5/5 because I would walk 500 miles for one of their lobster rolls."}
{"text":"Great food, good location. 
I have had several meals here and I always enjoy them. 
They have a nice wine list and their seasonal specials are always a treat. 
I usually go at slower times, because it can get crowded."}
{"text":"Food was old school - steamed broccoli and mashed potatoes with seafood - boooring. Service was ok. I hate having my plate whisked away while my dining partner is still eating.This is extreme rudeness and seems to be the thing to do in Cleveland."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here on our 1st anniversary 20 years ago today.  We no longer live in the state and just reminisced about it today while having an anniversary lunch elsewhere.  It's no wonder why you have stood the test of time--we still remember our delicious dinners!  Hopefully someday we will return!"}
{"text":"Salmon Dave's is the local yard stick that I use to compare other seafood restaurants in terms of food quality, taste and dinning experience. Went out on a Wednesday evening for dinner with my wife and I had an enjoyable meal. Few housekeeping items - parking is on the street and in a lot behind the restaurant that is shared with the other restaurant and shops on old Detroit road. We did not have reservations and decided to take a high top table instead of waiting for an open table. I recommend reservations if you want a table during prime dinning times. The noise level allowed for easy conversation, the background music was pleasant.

Our service was excellent, attentive and prompt while not overbearing. What I appreciated was the timing between items being serviced. Our drinks were served promptly and we had enough time to enjoy them before apps of Blue Points were served. We split a Ceaser salad that was good, nice that we were given the option to have anchovies with the salad (as a Ceaser should have in my opinion).

  My seafood Etoufee was excellent with a nice spice blend and a bit of heat. The shrimp,  mussels and fish were cooked to the right tenderness. My wife opted for the Salmon with risotto with the sauce on the side. The salmon looked good and my wife extremely pleased with her meal. 

Salmon Dave's in not a cheap eats place so expect to drop a few bucks for dinner. Given the food quality, excellent service, an ambiance that boarders between upscale casual to big night out I'm more than pleased to give a 5 star rating."}
{"text":"The most inclusive menu...
The freshest seafood...
The coolest presentation...
The best service...
The cool location...
A nice Happy Hour..

Cool customers like me!!!

Pricey but priced well...
I have enjoyed Salmon since that's why you come here. I have enjoyed crab cakes because why not. I have enjoyed fish and shrimp dishes because sometimes ya just dont want the expected. I have even ventured over to a burger and it was delish...
Heck, the fresh, warm crusty bread with ho eyes butter is even good. 
I think I would gamble that nothing here will disappoint."}
{"text":"Had a lunch with 3 other adults, on a Wednesday.
Food and service were both quite good.  
I had a cedar-plank grilled salmon steak that was excellent.  
The waiter, unasked,  brought me a tasting serving
of the lobster bisque when I expressed curiousity about it.
I would go back in an instant."}
{"text":"simply amzing from staff, service & food was ridiculously delicious!!! prices are amazing!!"}
{"text":"One of the better sea food places on the west side.  Came in without a reservation. Wait 25 min for a table.    Started with Calamari, very tender served with i slightly spicy sauce.  

I had the Crab stuffed shrimp with risotto.  Shrimp were perfectly cooked and the mushroom risotto had a very earthy flavor

My Bestie had the Main lobster pasta.  She was very happy with her dish. 

Our server Dianne was very nice and attentive."}
{"text":"i've eaten here before on a formal setting and the food was great.  so this review is not based upon that experience.

the bar situation leaves a lot to be desired.  for starters, the issue i had is also had at other restaurants the main company employs (i.e. blue point grille).

i met up with friends one friday night.  the bartender remembered me from a previous night, so he knew what i wanted as far as food...mixed up the drink but i wasn't concerned with that.

i ordered a burger with no bacon and fries.  i always emphasize this.  please...no...bacon.

so of course when it comes out there are bacon strips all over my burger.  i sat there really dejected and upset...the bartender comes over and dryly mentioned that he didn't know why bacon was on there and apologized really weakly.  they took the burger back, and came back out with the same burger because you could visibly see the lines left on the cheese where the bacon was.  also this had chips instead of fries.

i let it sit there.  another guy behind the bar...not sure if he was a manager, remarked...\"that isn't a good look on your face.\"

i don't see how hard it is to make something without bacon, and also it shouldn't be hard to get an order right.  

they comped the meal, i left, and i never went back.  and at this point...it doesn't look favorable for me to return."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and always have a great meal. The hostess was very friendly and accommodating - we even got a booth when we requested it.  Our waitress was outstanding and answered all our questions. The food is prepared very well. A little noisy but they are always packed so you have to kind of expect that. Really great place to go for seafood and I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"This is mine and my husband's favorite restaurant.  We LOVE--did I write L-O-V-E?!--their lobster bisque!!!  Every single time we eat there, no matter the time of the day, the food is absolutely wonderful, perfect, delicious.  We love the ambiance also and the service is always impeccable.  Five stars is not enough!"}
{"text":"I probably should've written a review of Salmon Dave's years ago -- when I would've easily given it between 4 and 5 stars.

Last week, we had probably our 25th meal here, and it was a bit of a miss all around, beginning with our server, who had a haughty, off-putting way about her. I thought I was alone in this opinion until both my wife and our friend made the same comment at almost the same time. It's funny how much the service can affect the overall meal. As an example, when my wife was asking a question about how one of the entrees was prepared, she quickly interrupted with, \"I don't know what you're asking me? What are you asking me?\" Quite rude.

The food was good but not as good as I remembered. I had the voodoo salmon with crab risotto and fried green tomatoes. The quality of the salmon was top notch, but it was bland and oversauced. Edible, good, but nothing special. The accompanying crab risotto was also bland, and the fried green tomatoes were very heavily breaded and somewhat sour. I left them almost untouched but had no inquiry as to why from our server.

My wife ordered the scallops and shrimp with dirty rice and fried okra, which she liked but was not wowed by. Again, high quality paired with somewhat underwhelming execution.

Our friend had steak -- the cut of which I don't recall. He seemed to like it well enough. He was a first-timer and, having eaten many meals with him, we had the sense he wasn't impressed.

We had 2 issues with drinks. First off, our server forgot we ordered them and said \"Just water, then?\" before remembering she must have never put the order in. When she delivered the pino and the zinfandel, she mixed them up, leaving one sip each from another person's wine.

The lobster bisque was very good, as usual, and I had a bowl of gumbo, also good."}
{"text":"Ate there last night. Haley was our waitress and had the personality of a stick.  It was obvious we were not her favorite customer.  Lobster bisque was very pasty and fair.  Dinner was excellent.  Had the shrimp and scallops.  My wife had the scallops as an app and but was served at room temperature.  She had crab cake for dinner which was excellent.  Seems like we were just a number.  Get in get out get someone else into our seat."}
{"text":"Outstanding dinner saturday!   Everyone was extremely pleased. I got the blue cheese encrusted steak and it was outstanding!!   My friends got lobster tail and cod which they loced as well"}
{"text":"This place has been declining in every way for the past 5 years.  It used to be one of my favorites since its opening in the 90's.  My husband and I had several sub standard meals and crossed it off our list.  So....decided to meet two girlfriends for dinner. We sat in bar area.  Waitress was not friendly and not very attentive and had a problem smiling.  We returned calamari app as it was burnt. The rest of the food wasn't bad, but not worth mentioning.  Other than to stop for drinks, I won't be having dinner here ever again. And yes, we still left the full tip assuming the waitress was having a bad day."}
{"text":"We were a little disappointed with both the service and the food on a recent visit. First off the food, I ordered their crusted halibut, the orange glaze was amazing and the dishes flavors were all great but my fish was way overcooked and completely dried out. My wife ordered a lobster pasta and it was fantastic.

The service; we were seated at the bar, we were there early in the evening and there were only two other patrons in the bar. The barman started out well enough, promptly taking our drink and dinner orders but then he just sort of forgot about us. We had to wave him over to our table to refill our obviously empty drinks, I would have liked to have given them a chance to fix my fish but he never came and asked how our food was. After waiting several very long minutes after we finished our meals for our dishes to be cleared ( we were seated at a small two top table) I began clearing them and was preparing to take them to the bar when another barmaid who seemed to be just checking in for work saw me and came and got them. At that point she inquired about our meals and handled our check. The barman was still there, still behind the bar, still the same four customers he just did not seem interested in taking care of us. We were very disappointed as we have always enjoyed this venue and usually find it excellent."}
{"text":"Salmon Dave's in Rocky River is a hard little spot to find, but definitely worth seeking out. I took a friend there on a Saturday afternoon, which I recommend because the parking and seating is a little cramped and limited. 

The service was friendly and prompt, and the food was well prepared and delicious. I had a ginger glazed salmon (what else?), and a house salad in a bowl constructed out of cucumbers. I also sampled some of the best Manhattan clam chowder that I have ever tasted...if you like it with a little heat. I will definitely be back to sample more of their creative menu."}
{"text":"I would give Salmon Dave's 5 stars, but it's just wayyy to pricey. 
We went on a Sunday and they had a jazz band for their Mardi Gras theme night. This was a great atmosphere, especially since it wasn't crowded or anything. 

Not too much to choose from, but man it all looked great. 
I got the lobster, chicken penne and my boyfriend got the mardi gras feast, and let me tell you...best steak I have EVER had... 

I would recommend this place if you are looking for a nice night out!"}
{"text":"ROCKY RIVER (CLEVELAND) OH: I was skeptical coming into the kitschy, cabinesque restaurant with a name like \"Salmon Daves,\" but after partaking of their delicious fare I can only sing praises.  It was outstanding and I can't wait to come back on my next Cleveland adventure.

It's no frills on the inside; a little dark and woodsy, with pleasant and laid back waitstaff.  The big menu is not pretending to be cool or recently reinvented, but the items immediately catch your attention for their uniqueness and creole inspiration.

FOOD: I tried three items

Voodoo Salmon (5 stars): This was awesome!  Delicious, perfectly prepared with just the right amount of spice and no fishy flavor.  You can't judge a place called \"Salmon Daves\" without tasting the salmon, and it was excellent.  Five stars.

Boudin Balls (5 stars):  Wow!  I had never seen a menu item like these and had to get them.  Spicy rice balled up, fried and served with creole dip.  They were wonderful and a conversation piece.  

Lobster Bisque (3.5 stars):  This was a good, well-prepared lobster bisque.  No surprises.

I am eager to return.  Salmon Daves clearly has passion for good food and traditional ingenuity that doesn't bend to trend but makes its own."}
{"text":"I liked the idea of the place more than the place itself - little cozy seafood restaurant hidden away in the armpit of the pseudo-marina. Besides the deer heads on the walls, atmosphere of the place strikes your ego immediately - you feel like such an accomplished grown up ( can pay for your own over-priced salmon). While prices grab your wallet naturally. But we come to restaurant primarily to eat, as we should, and nothing spectacular happens to you for $20+ for entrée, at Salmon's Dave. 
Cedar planked salmon left bitter after-taste in my cousin's mouth (birthday boy), my Korean hotpot was this wanna-be ethnic dish but was way too watered down with more than doubtful oysters and less than exciting coconut sauce. ( I can take you to places where they can prepare something much tastier for $12, but of course minus the starchy linen tablecloths. You will eat by the kitchen listening to 96.5 FM but it will be the best Korean meal of your life). 
My friend's salad was somewhat generic as well. Calamari was the only dish worth of complimenting - fresh and delightful.
All I can say - I don't need this. I am back to my under-privileged delicious dining of the youth. As long as it accepts me back."}
{"text":"Had dinner there on Friday the 13th of April by accident.  The folks at Ferris Steakhouse recommended the place because they were sold out that night.  Had an excellent meal thanks to our server Wes.  Did the surf and turf and wines BTG.  Did oysters rock.  Incredible.  Would return if we're ever on the Cleveland area ever again.  Prices reasonable not tourist priced.  Also loved the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious- had a great meal featuring lots of lobster and scallops and crab legs... I just love seafood. Can't give it a perfect score because of the outdated decor and...overpriced!"}
{"text":"I love going out on Sunday nights, trying desperately to pretend that I don't really have to go back to work the next day. Tonight I was apparently not alone, because it sure looked like a Saturday at Salmon Dave's. My partner in crime and I ended up at the bar, but we got exceptional service. We got the calamari to start; it was a little on the dry side, but the sauce was really flavorful, and the peanuts a nice touch. For dinner, I got the lobster cavatappi, which had plenty of lobster meat, spinach, and shiitake mushrooms in enough sauce to add flavor but not drown it. My husband got the pan roasted shrimp and scallops with lobster mashers and green beans. We both cleaned our plates. 

This isn't an everyday sort of place for us, because it's a little on the spendy side, but it should be on my radar more often. I've never had a bad or even mediocre meal here."}
{"text":"Flowers and candy (OK . . .  maybe candy . . or brownies) aren't really the key to my heart, so when a gentleman asked me out a few months ago I jokingly ( OK half joking) replied I'd go out with him if he found me the best scallops in the city. 

Que Salmon Dave's Pacific Grille.  

The first thing I notied about SD's was the gorgeous exposed brick, dark wood and candle light: beautiful ambiance . . and as a huge plus, was not too stuffy.  

We started out with the calamari appetizer which was fantastic.  It was cooked perfectly with light breading and served with a BBQ type sauce that had the perfect amount of sweetness and kick.  The portion was also very large and more than enough for 2 people to share.  

Obviously I ordered the scallops which were served with lobster mashers.  The mashers were creamy and delicious.  

And the scallops? Excuse me while I take a few moments to remember them . . . 

mmmmmm oh yes, mmmmmmm, mmmmmmm yeeeees . . . 

OK sorry about that. . . . .  

Best scallops I have ever had in Ohio.  Perfectly cooked, very flavorful, melt in your mouth mmmmmmm.  I have not been back since but that is only because I now live in the 614.  

Overall the service was great, fantastic wine, melt in your mouth food in a warm classy restaraunt.  Highly reccomend."}
{"text":"I had always heard good things, and I figured that for $$$, it had to be the real deal. Unfortunately, other than my rather tasty $6 reisling, I was entirely underwhelmed and disappointed. The atmosphere and the very pleasant waiter couldn't save this restaurant for me. I had baby arugula salad (which somehow fell short of its Cheesecake Factory counterpart), and Ginger Soy salmon. The food was so average, and for prices like this, that's not okay. Won't be back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for my birthday dinner this last Monday and we were both very happy with the choice. We got here around 6 and the place was not crowded at all. We were greeted right away and decided to sit at the bar until happy hour ended. During happy hour, they have $5 select cocktails, $2 off draft beer, and small($6) and large ($8) appetizers. We both ordered beer to start and shared an appetizer of lobster and chive risotto. The beer only ended up being 3.50 with the $2 off, which is way less than we expected. The risotto was perfect! I then tried a mule and it was also very good!

Once happy hour ended we moved to a booth and were seated right away. Since we had the appetizer, we were pretty full by this time and decided to share the surf and turf. They were able to split it between two plates for us and the chef brought it out himself and was very friendly. Sharing, we each got a filet medallion, half of a lobster tail, mashed potatoes, and asparagus. It was the perfect amount and so good! They also give you a basket of bread (at the bar and the table) and a sweetish butter that was also very tasty. 

We will definitely return! Especially for happy hour, this place is a great deal for what you get!"}
{"text":"Lobster bisque was heavenly, service was attentive and wait staff was generally jovial. Main dish was between average and quite good, but definitely not anything in the excellent range except the bisque, which was excellent. (it could be that I haven't had it in a while)

I made a point to explain to the waiter that I was celebrating an occasion and at the end of the meal he brought out a creme brûlée with a candle free of charge. While a lot of places are tacky when it comes to celebration policy's, this was done tastefully and low key.

Over all a good trip to Salmon Dave's."}
{"text":"This will be short. 

Food was decent. Not qreat but certainly edible. What's unacceptable are their prices. What, this restaurant's really in NYC and I just fantasized it was in River? 

Get serious, people. If you're going to charge prices like that you need to perform WAY close to the top of your game, and this wasn't even remotely there. 

Player's on Madison and Deagans on Detroit are two places that immediately come to mind where you can get better fish dishes for considerably less money. 

This will be our last visit here. Simply not worth it."}
{"text":"Similar to Blue Point. Not in River much. Have a good happy hour too. Little hard to locate first time around."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here and both had fish.  It's been awhile, so I can't remember exactly what I had, but I remember that it was not very good and extremely over priced.  Save yourself the effort."}
{"text":"A place like Salmon Dave's gives visitors a good snapshot of the state of cuisine evolution in the fabled unhip Midwest. This is a place that locals to go eat on a night out, old school style, related to the supper clubs of yesteryear and dishes that most people in California have never heard of, like beef wellington and chicken a la king. However, Dave's has kept pace with the times, so that while they still have a \"Surf and Turf\" category on their menu, they also have seared ahi tuna and szechuan green beans. Nothing is cutting edge, but everything is done as well as it can be, and this is a safe place for old-school diners to sample some new types of food.

While the martini menu is very of the moment, the beer menu is still circa 1970."}
{"text":"The gumbo soup is so OMG good, chunky, full of diff sausage and rice yum.  Salmon excellent."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner while out of town. Great food and really liked the atmosphere. Would definitely go again if in the area. Seafood was excellent"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and delicious food. The lobster risotto was great! Our food was taking quite a while and we aren't ones to complain. The manager came up to us, explained the situation and offered complimentary drinks and dessert. They uphold very good customer service. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Rarely have dinner here but one of my favorites for the lunch special- small sandwich, soup and a salad for a great price.  Everything is delicious!  Try the lobster bisque."}
{"text":"Restaurant Week is what drew me in to Salmon Dave's. They had good offerings and I was pretty hungry just thinking about the deliciousness.

I brought along my friend, Amber, who had been there several times before. 
My first impression- what a charming restaurant! I loved the décor and the location and there were lots of people at the bar so I am not alone in my thoughts.

Amber was already one martini in and saved me some ahi sashimi. They serve it with soy sauce, wasabi, ginger and a wakame salad. The tuna was so perfect and fresh and flavorful, I didn't even need the accompaniments. Delicious. I knew I wasn't drinking, but they had a nice wine menu.

We both selected the twin filet for our meal which came with asparagus and mashed potatoes. My filet, though slightly undercooked for my taste, was very good. The demi glace was flavored well without being too salty. Nice seasoning on the steak. The asparagus was cooked perfectly- simple, bright but still a little snap. The mashed potatoes were a bit of a disappointment. I'm not going to say they are from pearls/ a box, but they didn't taste homemade to me. My lobster bisque was fine, but nothing to Yelp about. I had a bite of Amber's salad and it was delicious- great presentation and I loved the dressing and elements of texture.

We shared dessert of crème brulee with raspberry coulis and a flourless chocolate torte. Wow. The brulee had a golden crust and I loved the bright, tangy coulis. The torte was light enough and I loved the crusty base and homemade whipped cream.  

I've heard great things about Salmon Dave's crab legs and of course, salmon. I would definitely come back to check out seafood!"}
{"text":"OMG
We were there for lunch and I ordered the mahi mahi with asparagus (in a sauce) and lobster risotto. Are you kidding me....I was humming through the whole eating experience.....this was the best meal I've had in ages. We will be back soon and I've told everyone to go and have this same experience. My husband had the crab cakes and although they were good - they did not match the flavor in my lunch."}
{"text":"My mother and I came here to celebrate her sister beating cancer. This is a meal that I will always remember. The service was very good. My mom is not a fish lover and ordered the chicken marsala. It was cooked perfectly and was very tender. I ordered the cedar planked salmon. Both dishes were just under $20 per plate. The steak and other things are all around $20-$30. The food is on the pricier side and I don't think I will be here every week but it is good if you are looking to have a nice dinner. The atmosphere is nice without being stuffy. I have been meaning to come here for years and am glad that I finally made it."}
{"text":"My wife and I dined here for our anniversary recently. It is a bit pricey but if you are trying to get good sea food in northern Ohio you have to be willing to spend some money otherwise it's just Red Lobster. 

I was told to get the lobster bisque, and I'm glad I did. It was rich and creamy and had a couple of big chunks of lobster. The service was excellent and the atmosphere was cozy, especially nice on a cold evening. My twin lobster tail entree was very good and the shrimp cocktail appetizer was the kind of quality I expected.

No big surprises. This is a good high end seafood restaurant."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE! I have been to this restaurant several times and have never been disappointed! My boyfriend and I met there after work for a quick cocktail which turned into drink and apps. 

They have a sampler platter that is.amazing. we were trying to eat a little healthier so we asked to switch out the ceab rangpons with their ahi tuna. Without hesitation, they allowed us to do that and it was a great choice. Their tuna is amazing!!!! 

A few weeks later we returned and had full meals. Surf and turf was amazing. The lobster tail was cooked perfectly as was the medium rare steak. Just typing this has my mouth watering! Such a great place. When you go, dont forget to try the lobster bisque! Sweet and savory in every spoon full!

Yummm!!!!"}
{"text":"We were a party of 6 that made reservations for 10 pm this New Year's Eve. We watched the two hostess exchange words that our table had been given to someone else. We were sat at 1020. 

15 min after ordering we were told that they were out of mashed potatoes, which came w/ all of our steaks. we understand bc it's NYE. We were offered dessert as compensation & he brought out a sample of all the desserts. When we got the bill we noticed we were charged $6 a person for the dessert. This was deceitful at best and extremely terrible service. We never wanted dessert and we accepted the apology and his offer for dessert from all of the things that went wrong throughout the night. It turned our forgiving attitudes and our \"it's okay we understand it's New Year's Eve\" to \"I can't believe we all got charged for this.\" I sincerely regret my choice to spend my money and night here."}
{"text":"This restaurant was AMAZING! Our food was delicious, timely, and decently priced. Our waiter was attentive, friendly, and informative. (Ask for Wes!)

We will defiantly be back again! Xo"}
