{"text":"I have been here a few times now and the food and service are always exceptional.  The fettuccine mare mondo is my favorite and.  The service is amazing, the staff can't do enough for you even when they are packed on a Saturday night!"}
{"text":"Food is OK but salty,otherwise it is ok it is better than Grazhi prices are better.service was great."}
{"text":"A gem hidden in an industrial place. This is a very friendly place with excellent food and service. The food is so well prepared with a varied menu. The second your arrive, staff welcomes you like family. Make a reservation because people are finding out about this place!"}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant in an unassuming location. In an cozy setting, the food is excellent and portions generous."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. Definitely one of my favourites in the Vaughan area. Prices are great. Portions are huge, and the food is to die for."}
{"text":"The meal was soooo heavy to digest , a big portion with low quality and taste ! It took so long to have our meal at the table , not going there again ! Price was a bit expensive as its not downtown!"}
{"text":"This Italian restaurant is perfect in so many levels. The ambience, friendliness of the staff, menu, and of course, the food. This is my most favorite Italian restaurant in the area but unfortunately they are full on weekends. You need reservation a week ahead if you want to dine here on weekend.
Their tiramisu is not over sweetened and made at a perfect balance and harmony.

It would be nice if they have more seatings and can accommodate more patrons. But I guess this is the right size to maintain the cozy feeling of this place."}
{"text":"Sooooo good we keep going back. Great food and service."}
{"text":"A GREAT place to go for authentic Italian food. Their pastas are freshly made which makes the biggest difference. Portion size is big so if you have a small appetite prepare to take home. Love their chili oil that comes with bread as a appetizer. If you are planning to go to this place to dine I do suggest to make reservations as they are super busy and don't do take out or wait list cause they only have a certain amount of food each day to serve."}
{"text":"I was last night for a confirmation dinner it was fantastic this little gem had amazing food from the pizza the calamari and the veal chop you won't be disappointed go check it out"}
{"text":"This restaurant is very warm and welcoming.  I came with my boyfriend last night for dinner and it has that European feeling.  The business is family owned.  The waitress Danielle was extremely friendly. The owners came to my table numerous times to make sure we were happy with the food and service...they love talking and getting to know thier customers.  I could tell there are alot of repeat customers because they knew everyone that walked in by name!

Anyway on to the food...I had a grilled calamari to start.  It comes with a big salad.  The portions are definitley sharing portions!...They are huge! I wasnt to fond of the salad dressing but the calamari was amazing. They like to grill it well done.  I had penne alla vodka for my main course.  I like how their sauce is a little different from what Ive seen at other places.  All the ingredients are blended together in the sauce so you don't get bug chunks of tomatoe or onion.  Again the portion was huge!  I actually think it was for 4 people!  I ended up bringing half of it home.

I think this restaurant is fairly new.  It's hidden in concord or vaughan area.  I would definitley go back for some authentic italian food!"}
{"text":"I work nearby and this restaurant is always busy during lunch hours. I've been here only twice during lunch and the service is really slow. The food is very good. Would return for dinner and not lunch as it took almost 40mins for my order to come out the last time I was there."}
{"text":"This place is an absolute hidden gem locked away in an unassuming industrial plaza. Don't be fooled, once inside you feel like you're in a quaint restaurant in Italy! Amazing Penne Alla vodka and antipasto platter -  both are an absolute must when I dine here! Highly recommended. Great ambiance, authentic feel, warm service."}
{"text":"Perfecto!  Our lunch was delicious and the staff were very friendly. I enjoyed the spaghetti with meatballs and my husband ordered the chicken parmigiana. The portions were a very good size. Unfortunately I did not have room for dessert as I would have  loved to try their tiramisu."}
{"text":"Going to Anna Maria's is like coming home. I'm surprised its taken me this long to write a review as my family and I frequent this restaurant for special events or just a night out. Anna Maria's is one of the most authentic restaurants in Vaughan. They keep with the real Italian tradition of keeping it simple and not losing any flavor. The thing I love most is that you are not rushed out, EVER!! They encourage you to enjoy and spend the evening surrounded by your company because they know the value of time spent with family and friends. If you want to get a table, definitely book a reservation just in case. Its so worth it! Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"This place was busy on a sat night.  Seemed like the whole family worked there.  Great atmosphere with the live music and cosy room.  Great food good portions.  Will return soon"}
{"text":"Went here for a family dinner.  My god, I felt like I was at my Nonna's house the food was amazing, the atmosphere was great. Had the chicken parm with penne pomodoro it was certainly a 5/5.  I would highly recommend this place and will go again."}
{"text":"We arrived late on a Saturday night for the 'burbs at about 9:30pm. There were four of us in the party. The place was packed. The atmosphere was chatty and the live band were serenading the guests in Italian. We were greeted by no fewer than 3 different staff members as they walked past while our table was being readied. It's decorated inside to look like an old Italian house. 

Once seated they brought bread and homemade spicy oil to the table. 

We ordered 2 minestrone soups and one grilled calamari for starters. 

The mains were 2 grilled salmons on a bed of spinach risotto with steamed vegetables and roast potato wedges. The fish was delicate and cooked to perfection, the vegetables were at the perfect state of soft with a bit of bite and the potatoes were soft inside with a light crispy outer layer. The risotto was creamy. One mushroom risotto, a beautiful bowl of cremini mushrooms saut√©ed in white wine and rice. Very tasty, smooth and creamy on the pallet, a generous portion. And Gnocchi ala vodka. The gnocchi was hand made soft and creamy. The sauce was thick and smothered the gnocchi deliciously. We were offered freshly ground pepper and parmigiana which they were generous with. At this point have to say that all 4 meals were brought out at exactly the same time, all perfectly cooked and hot. 

For dessert we ordered 2 tiramisu a tea, an espresso and 2 Americanos. The owner and his son were friendly and chatting with the patrons. Genuinely lovely people. They even treated us to nightcaps, we chose Limoncello. 

Our bill was $164 before tip. We are looking forward to going back. 

The server was attentive and checked up on us regularly. I'd say that to date this has been one of the best spots we've found in the 905 area."}
{"text":"I've been there a few times since my friend took me a few summers ago. All I can say that their food quality is beyond exceptional! So in case you wanna go their for a meal, be sure to make reservations first. They are closed on Sundays and opens at 5 pm on Saturdays.  So I suggest that you go during weekdays to avoid the wait.  The items I suggest to try are as follows:

Calamari Fritti
Light battered calamari rings with primavera sauce on the side.  When you bite into the ring, it will be a little bouncy yet not rubbery at all.

Risotto Al Funghi
Risotto with mixed mushrooms in white wine sauce.  This is not the usual risotto where the rice is hard inside and starchy outside.  The risotto is cooked all the way through with just the right texture.  You will definitely taste the wine sauce.

Zuppa di Pesce All'Adriatica in tomato sauce
Mixed seafood in tomato base soup served with toasts.  Their fish in big fillets, prawns, mussels etc.  It is definitely a good portion to share.  The tomato soup is light and refreshing yet not too sour.  If you want something light this will be a good choice.

Fettuccine Mare Monde
Fettuccine with crab, scallops, mushrooms and green onion in white creamy sauce.  The fettuccine is cooked al dante, the cream sauce is not too heavy that will overpower the seafood.

Their dessert is the famous tiramisu served in a glass.  Some people say they had better but because I'm a tiramisu lover so I say that it is very moist and light.

Of course lastly, the service by the servers is excellent, very polite and quick response to requests.  Overall I can say that this is by far the best Italian restaurant I've been to."}
{"text":"Small authentic Italian atmosphere. It seems like a family run business. The night we went there was 2 big parties that pretty much took up the whole restaurant. The service was slow as the staff was attending to the big parties. However when we did have our server at our table she was fantastic she made excellent recommendations. 

We started with a pizza which was burnt and it was so disappointing because the pictures on Yelp looked so amazing we were really looking forward to it. 

I ordered the Linguine Mondo and David had the gnocchi (made in house) both tasted so delicious!!!!!"}
{"text":"The 3 stars are based only on the fact that I came here for lunch, If it was for dinner I am sure I will give this place 5 stars
The service is amazing and the food is perfect. I started working near this restaurant. When I first started the job I really thought I was going to starve to death. I come from downtown and the area is relatively secluded with very few if any place around.
This restaurant was a pleasant surprise.
The inly comment i have is, since they are open in a corporate part of the city. a lunch menu would come in handy. smaller portion , faster service and lower prices. 
The price is worth it 100% but it is not affordable for a lunch during work. $18 for a spaghetti meat balls is the price at a prime restaurant downtown for dinner. paying it for lunch in Vaughn is not something i can justify"}
{"text":"In terms of Italian restaurants, for sure this place far exceeds Alice fazooli's. 

The pre-meal bread (not hot) came with a bowl of jalape√±o, garlic, oil, and other ingredients that went well with the sliced bread.

Bruschetta was surprisingly delicious despite the simple ingredients. 

I ordered the meat lovers pizza ($17.95) and my wife ordered the fettuccine mare mondo ($19.95).

Meat lovers pizza: salami, capicollo, bacon, Italian hot sausage, soppressata
   -lots of meat and very flavorful, a bit salty but manageable 

Fettuccine mare mondo: in a cream sauce, crab, scallops, mushrooms and green onions

I would give both dishes 7/10.
They have house-made gnocchi if you're into that, but not my type of pasta."}
{"text":"This little gem is tucked away in a commercial/industrial zone on Langstaff east of Jane. It's a small restaurant so best to make reservations or you'll be disappointed. 
We had pasta e fagiolo for starters. It's the best I've ever had in a restaurant and reminds me of the way my grandmother used to make it. Just delicious!
Followed this with a bowl of home made gnocchi in a tomato basil sauce. What a feel good, delicious dish. 
I've been here other times and I recommend the Campagnola pizza which is made with sausage and rapini toppings. It's their signature pizza. 
All in all, if you want an Italian meal that tastes like the good old days, this is the place to go. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I had dinner with my friend who received this restaurant in the area. A true gem and an authentic Italian family restaurant. The hosts and servers are very, very friendly.  Their hot peppers are too die for.... Calendar fritti was very crispy and not oily at all.  We ordered a veal main and the side pasta was very nice, al dente with a nice texture. Will definitely come back for another visit!"}
{"text":"If I could eat here for the rest of my life, I would. I could not believe how good the food was. Being Italian myself, there is no other place that compares to homemade cooking. This is as close as it gets. I'm still dreaming of the food.

We got a big portion of calamari to start, which came with tomato paste on the side, something different. They brought out peppers in hot oil with the bread, they know me too well. To eat for our main dishes, I had the \"spaghetti alla chitarra\". You could tell the sauce and pasta were homemade, and so fresh! I've had the dish in the motherland, and it's almost comparable. The meatballs were a good size, and sooo yummy. 

The penne and grilled chicken was excellent. They used a sweeter sauce for the penne which complimented the chicken very well. 
 
The plates are expensive but they are well worth it. The place is small, but it's always the small Italian restaurants that have the best food! Customer service was excellent. We had no reservations, coming in to celebrate a special occasion for a party of four, and they accommodated us right away. 

I will be coming back, and I can't wait to try more on the menu!"}
{"text":"Family style dining. Friendly servers except for the Italian guy. Big groups of people will feel comfortable here. Not expensive. Large portions. Unimaginative food"}
{"text":"Authentic Italian food with fresh ingredients and amazing flavours.  Absolutely the best Italian food I've had since my nonna.
Highly recommend their daily specials, stuffed ravioli and spinach in rose sauce, chicken marsala, risotto both mushroom and seafood and pizza."}
{"text":"What a FANTASTIC place! My girlfriend and I drove half an hour to meet up with some friends for dinner - and let me say... it was well worth the drive. First, the service: Warm and friendly staff make you feel like you are a part of the family. What more can you ask for from an Italian restaurant? 2nd, the food: authentic, fresh, healthy portions, fantastic wine, and surprisingly at very affordable prices. Perfect place for a date or a get together with friends or family! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Wonderful night thank you!!
Everything is perfect :)

Service was great, made us feel like home 
Environment was nice, very cozy. 
Food: home cooking :D"}
{"text":"What can you say other than fantabulous!  Great food, great service, great atmosphere.  Tucked away in the corner of an industrial plaza, but stands alone in quality.  More than abundant portions.  Pricing reasonable.  Don't pass this gem up.  Must be on your bucket list.  Earns 10 stars out of 5!"}
{"text":"The ranking is purely on food. The service was fantastic. I don't understand how this place can have such a high rating though. Food was average at best, not real Italian. Would not eat here again."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Great Italian food, friendly service, good prices. It is a bot crowded but you feel like you are in Italy :-)
The owner is a very nice guy, he came after dinner and talked to ask about what we liked and what not, the restaurant was full but he made us feel very special: we chatted for about 5-10 minutes and talked about hockey, Miami, and mayor Ford :-) 
Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"It was not easy to get a reservation on a Saturday. I booked it a week ahead and received a phone call on Tuesday to confirm it. We arrived early 5:10. There was only one other couple in the restaurant and only 2 empty tables for 2.  We were seated right beside the other couple at the smallest table they had beside a large post. We asked to be seated at the other table for 2 and were told that was not possible; that all the reservations were timed! There was no one else in the restaurant and there was no reason they could not have seated us at the other table. We were then  told they do not reserve specific tables so why were we not allowed to sit at the other empty table since no specific table reservations are accepted. The alcoholic drinks were small and the bloody Caesar was not very good.  The rim was not thick as requested. We barely had our drinks before they brought our appetizers. 
 They were rushing us and there was only one other couple in the restaurant. The grilled calamari was very good.  The Caesar salad was okay but did not have any bacon:( and not enough garlic. The pasta  (LINGUINE ALLA DIAVOLA) was excellent!  My partner's  empty plate was taken away the second he put his last bite in his mouth while he was still chewing. This is considered rude as it leaves the other person eating alone.  Generally the whole meal was poorly timed. The only choice for dessert was Tiramisu. The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because the food was very good.
May 6/17 Thanks for your response.  We did ask for the rim to be redone and it was still not thick as requested.  The seating is a huge issue for me as I felt we were unnecessarily squeezed into the smallest place possible in an almost empty restaurant.  I would get take out pasta  ( as the pasta dish was awesome!!!) but this is not a restaurant I would go to on a regular basis because of how we were rushed and their refusal to move us to another table while the restaurant was almost empty."}
{"text":"This place is amazing make sure you make reservations a week before they're always booked!"}
{"text":"We loved the ambience of Anna Maria's the minute we walked in...the food, service and interaction with staff made us love it more. Loved the \"family\" spirit of team the most. Incredible food and we felt welcomed like \"long time customers\"... thank you Anna Maria!!! See you soon. Shelley and Peter"}
{"text":"First time going here and I will definitely be coming back. 
The salad wash fresh. 
I had Gluten Free corn pasta with the vodka sauce, it was amazing, one of the best I've ever had. 
The atmosphere was great. It was like you are in Europe at a restaurant in the street. 
Amazing!"}
{"text":"After years of searching I've finally found an Italian restaurant that tastes as good as my mother's cooking! 

My first experience eating here was so good that my wife and I had our daughter's Baptism here. Food is authentic and service was spectacular!!

Restaurant isn't large so it might be difficult to make weekend reservations. I would suggest this restaurant to anyone who asks me if I know a good Italian restaurant. I will be a repeat customer for sure."}
{"text":"First time visiting today and nothing short of fantastic. Frank and Daniela are both amazing people and the food is to die for. Amazing REAL AUTHENTIC Italian food! Will definitely be returning!"}
