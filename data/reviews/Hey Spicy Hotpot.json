{"text":"I was here for dinner last night, and this place was pretty horrible. The taste was fine. There were only two waitresses working on a Sunday night, I'm not saying their services were bad, but they were too busy to take care every customer at the same time. The worst part was that we found a big worm(vegetable caterpillar) at the time we almost done... Although they offered 50% off for the whole meal, it was still a very bad dining experience..."}
{"text":"This is supposed to be one of those trendy hotpot places but as soon as you step inside, you realize that it's not.  We went there on a Saturday night and it was pretty busy and this place is small!  We waited for about 30 minutes and the servers just didn't seem professional, I felt like they were a little lost.  This place wasn't very clean at all, there were some flies in the sauce area, dishes and things were piled outside of the washroom area.  Like I said this place is small inside.  The food selection was good, all you can eat with all traditional hotpot items.  Beware that their spicy soup is extremely spicy, even with 'small spicy' it is very spicy.  Go to Morals Village at Hwy 7 and Kennedy if you're looking for a clean, big and good place for hotpot."}
{"text":"I have been visiting Hey Spicy three times.  I am loving this place.  All hot pot ingredients are so fresh, including, meat and vegetable.  Services are not bad at all.  Some minor things that I think there are room to improve, overall space (it's a small shop); sauces areas (this is way to small, also way too crowded because the bar and the cashier are right next to it. it's a dangerous area too, since hot soup are transported busily at the same time while customers are getting sauces right in 2 steps away.)  Yes, I have to agree it is a bit pricey.  It's almost $40.00 per person.    I love the soup base, both spicy and non spicy ones ,especially the big bone soupbase.  Also, the selection of beef triples and others are amazing.  Will visit again for sure."}
{"text":"Would not recommend.   The price for Mondays-Thursdays is $25.99.  Ordering the soup base was an additional $2.99-$6.99 charge!! We ordered the spicy soup because we assumed it was their specialty due to their name. The spicy soup base had no flavour to it other than spiciness. This costed me an additional 6.99 which i thought was not worth it. There were no complimentary drinks other than water which some places that charge this amount would offer; such as plum juice or pop.   The waiting staff weren't very attentive. They spent majority of the time avoiding eye contact or simply too unaware of their surroundings to notice me. One of the staff walked past me twice not noticing i was trying to get her attention. With the small space they were serving, the 4 staff did a horrible job. It took what seemed like 15 minutes for the first staff to even come back with any type of tableware (chopsticks, plates etc). We had to flag them down twice for us to get our first cup of water, and a third time for a cup of water for my SO. Yes, the server actually brought us only one cup of water for our table of two. She assumed my SO didn't want anything to drink.   The hotpot was one of the last things to arrive at our table after the food arrived. They also neglected to turn on the hotpot when they brought it to our table, so we spent another 5 minutes trying to figure that out. It's certainly not difficult to turn it on, but it's pretty standard practice to turn the stove on for a customer.   All in all, the food was mediocre, it took several requests to get some dishes, no one came to top off our hotpot or take away the plates, self serve area for sauce doesn't seem too hygienic, menu was frustrating to understand if you did not read Chinese, and it's far too overpriced. We eat hotpot occasionally and find this place to be expensive and they don't take credit card. It was the lack of service and food selection that I'm basing my review on. The fact that it's overpriced is merely icing on the cake.   p.s. they did even offer napkins. You pick that up at the self serve area..."}
{"text":"Giving this review an update after my second visit.  Went with three friends around 7:30pm.  Waited for almost an hour in the storm door.  Since it's not a large place you'll end up waiting here (or outside) if there's a lineup.  Since they don't limit your stay time, be warned that you could be waiting a while if you go around this time.  So go early if you can.  They sat us at a reasonably large table, which was nice.  Only problem is that one of the two hotpot pads weren't working.  We looked to our right and saw another table had a portable option set up so I'm a little confused why they didn't give us one as well (also, does that mean two hotpot pads were broken?).  For being a place that hasn't been around for very long, there's no way they should have stuff breaking down on them already - and if they do, they should be giving us an alternate pad.  I hold my ground on saying that their food is good for the most part.  My girlfriend unfortunately noticed that the spinach tasted very grainy, meaning it likely wasn't washed.  Ew?  Only food related problem I saw.  Menu requires work, both based on my comments before and the fact that there's at least two typos on it (cusumber for cucumber and muttom for mutton) - which comes off as looking sloppy.  The sauces require labels in English.  What they have is the labels on the wall in both English and Chinese but the sauces are moved around so much that they aren't always in the right spot.  The ones in bottles in particular are only labeled in Chinese so both my girlfriend and I got the wrong sauce.  Putting labels in English would fix this problem.  Service still needs a ton of work.  They never check up on you at all - whether they're at full or short capacity, it doesn't matter.  There's also times we'd write \"Item x3\" (for example) and we'd get what looks like one order - so they don't seem to have a consistent way of doing portions.  All You Can Eat places tend to charge you if leave food but I don't \"think\" they do that here anyway (so I guess it doesn't matter?).  They also tend to forget to bring you certain food.  I think they missed something on our order once on three or four times.  I don't mind paying the price they charge, given that their food's really tasty, but there's so many problems with parts of their restaurant that looking for a different hotpot restaurant might be a better option."}
