{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night at 6pm and there were only 3 other people in the entire restaurant. As soon as I walked in there was an employee drinking a beer! Seriously? The food was bland, half of my meal was cold and there was no option of order a side of noodles/chicken for my son. Overpriced and under seasoned. We will not come back."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Best sushi I've had in a long time. Everything was very fresh and flavorful."}
{"text":"We tried Zen for the first time recently. We thought it was very good and will return. Huge menu with a variety of Chinese and Japanese.  We shared almost everything. Started with the steamed \"meat\" dumplings...not sure what the meat mixture was...most dumplings state pork, but it seemed darker. They were good, but not the best I've had. I had egg drop soup which was very flavorful and good. My dinner mate had an egg roll which accompanied the entree. She said it was ok, typical non-spectacular egg roll that seems to be the norm these days. (Why can't anyone make an egg roll like Chinatown Inn, or the old Chin's anymore?  This makes me so sad.). Not sure which variety it was, as it was the one that came with the order of an entree....they offer pork, shrimp and veg on the menu.  

We ordered a sushi roll which was presented beautifully and was excellent. The wasabi was a little dry though.  

We shared \"three kings\" entree that was made with shrimp, chicken and beef in a garlic sauce. The shrimp were a nice size and cooked perfectly, and the chicken and beef were tender. Flavor was great. This dish stated that it was spicy. They did not ask how spicy we liked it, and we found it go be much too mild. If something says it's spicy, and I order it, it means I want it spicy!  

My dinner mate ordered her favorite type of martini which was not on their drink list, and it wasn't very good.

Service was great and attentive (bill said Sheri) but not overbearing, plenty of refills on my iced tea without having to ask. On the tables are duck sauce, 2 soy sauces and salt. No pepper, and we would've liked the addition of hot mustard for the egg roll (and to spice up our not-so-spicy entree).

Atmosphere is modern and comfortable-we we're in a booth in front of the sushi bar and we're able to see all the beautiful plates of sushi being prepared. 

We will return."}
{"text":"Modern decor, great staff, very good sushi rolls.

I was hesitant to try out Zen; we're Oakmont residents but faithful to Taipei & Jimmy Wan's in Fox Chapel for sushi. 

We were impressed with our rolls at Zen; I would say they're on level with Taipei & Jimmy Wan's. Sorely needed in this neck of the woods! 

We did not have time to lounge, on our way to a house party afterwards. Therefore we did not have drinks, so we can't comment on their quality. 

Service was excellent; always available and drinks always refilled before empty. 

The kinks are still being worked out -- ambient music changes, sometimes the carpets aren't swept in between guests. 

We absolutely will return and look forward to trying more menu items."}
{"text":"First of all, I should have known my bill would be expensive when the prices weren't listed online.  The general tso and Szechuan chicken were SO BLAND. No spice / kick WHAT SO EVER.  It was almost like the sauce was mostly water??? I was very unimpressed. And then, to make matters worse... The fortune cookies did not have A FORTUNE. So its just a cookie? I could go to the Oakmont Bakery if I wanted a cookie. ¯\_(?)_/¯"}
{"text":"I went to Zen for the first time today for lunch.  The restaurant is beautiful, spacious and very clean.  The temperature of the restaurant was perfect, which is hard to find sometimes as places crank up the AC far too high.  

I had 3 sushi rolls- spicy tuna, california and shrimp tempura rolls.  They were very fresh and tasted great.  The presentation was very nice as well.  

The only thing preventing me from giving 5 stars is that although they do have lunch specials for non sushi entrees, they do not have any lunch special for sushi.  There are other restaurants in the area such as Ichibahn that offer lunch specials on certain maki rolls.  It was about $25 including tip for 3 rolls, which isn't terrible given the quality, but I do not typically spend that much on lunch.  

A great addition to the area.  I will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"The service and ambiance was really good. The miso soup was bland and the salad dressing was gross. Tasted like straight mayo. The sushi was good but the tuna roll was very dark and fishy tasting. There are better, cheaper sushi places in Pittsburgh but I will try this place again in the future."}
{"text":"My wife and I really enjoy the sushi and the kids love everything else. Friendly atmosphere and good food. I frequent this place at least twice a month, a little pricey but worth it for fresh food."}
{"text":"Food and service was good! We started with the Hot and Sour soup- nice and spicy and delicious! We got the Crab Rangoon which were yummy.  The Lettuce Chicken wraps were awesome! We also had the Pad Thai which was good but had a fishy taste! We still enjoyed it! We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"First time here the sushi was amazing. The menu had some other good looking options definitely will be back"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed Zen. The service was outstanding, the portions are good and they have a great dinner special Sunday thru Thursday.  Tonight we had Chicken with String Beans and Hunan Chicken.  We also started with the appetizer sampler.  The meals came with soup or spring roll. All this for $39. Not bad for dinner for 2 with enough for lunch tomorrow.  I gave 4 instead of 5 because the Hunan Chicken was not spicy as expected. This is a great find in Plum."}
{"text":"I've stopped by here a few times to pick up orders - I've never eaten in yet. I've gotten a few Shrimp Tempura rolls, an order of Sesame Chicken, Chicken Lo Mein, and Cashew Shrimp on different occasions. Aside from the tempura roll being a tiny bit on the bland side, I haven't been disappointed yet. Gorgeous atmosphere and friendly staff. Happy to have a nice Asian restaurant close to home. I hope this place does well!"}
{"text":"This place is GREAT!! We live in Plum and drive by this place everyday. Sooooo glad we decided to give it a try. Delicious food, friendly staff and large portions.  By far, the best sit-down Chinese restaurant I've been to.  Hot & sour soup and egg rolls best ever, too. General Tso's is perfect. Can't wait to come back with the whole family. Go there... tell your friends... let everyone know that Plum Borough is THE place that get some GREAT Chinese food!!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times now, the food was great and tasty.  Nice ,clean and welcoming !"}
{"text":"I waited a while to try this place so they could work out any kinks. I have only ever been to one other asian style restaurant in this area and it was just okay, so my baseline hopes weren't too high. I was impressed by the interior for the most part. They spent a lot of effort in it, which was really nice. It's mostly black and green inside with some gold accents, so it isn't a bright place. The colors make it look serious and cool. 

They had a pretty large menu. It was sort of setup with Chinese food and then Japanese food. I decided to get sushi, so I hadn't spent much time reviewing the Chinese food menu, but I saw the orders for other tables come out, and they looked very nice! Really good presentation which is becoming more rare. 

I ordered the Avocado Roll, Cucumber Roll and Sweet Potato Roll. It took a very long time to come out. The waiter took note and said he was going to get me some chips. He never did but he did bring me my food instead. I got the feeling we really couldn't understand eachother. When the plate came out, my Cucumber Roll had crab in it. I ate the other two rolls and took the last one to go for my husband, as I don't eat meat or fish. When I looked at the bill, he never put me down for the Cucumber Roll, he thought I had ordered the California Roll. That was very frustrating. I even pointed to the ones I wanted when ordered.

The sushi itself was quite good. They are a nice size and fairly priced. I feel conflicted about coming back because I don't want to waste money with another miscommunication. That situation makes vegetarians in particular feel very threatened because you can never fully trust from then on that your dishes will be free of meat."}
{"text":"What a great new Chinese and sushi place!! Fresh, clean, and elegant atmosphere. Food is very good! Sushi is extremely fresh and your \"typical\" Chinese food menu is great too. Recommend starting out with edamame and eggrolls. All are great! Hidden gem more people need to visit!"}
{"text":"Live in Oakmont and have been to Zen twice now.  Simply said....food is so so and service is poo poo."}
{"text":"Third time for me and still amazing! 
This visit I had the miso soup and pad thai. Wonderful flavor from both. My dining company had a sushi roll and kung paw. The sushi had the perfect amount of rice...not over kill like some other places. Kung paw was amazing as well. We left full and very happy."}
{"text":"This isn't your average takeout restaurant. 

It's worth the in-house dining experience. 

The food is always great, the staff is super friendly, and their combination of Chinese + Japanese cuisine broadens the available food options 

It's a tad pricey for dinner but the portions can easily be shared. The lunch option is very affordable."}
{"text":"Absolutely love zen! Modern and clean on the inside! I ordered to go and got a California roll and crab Rangoon. The crab Rangoon had such a good flavor to it. Also the California roll was awesome and had a large lump of crab meat! Overall a great experience will definitely come back again!"}
