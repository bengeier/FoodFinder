{"text":"Delicious coffee and tasty treats. And with free wifi and cool tunes, it's a great atmosphere for getting work done too!

{"text":"Love all the vegan baked goods they offer!! I got my first vegan donut here and i was more than satisfied. they've got a large variety of drinks and meals too. They've got super nice staff. Not the most quiet space if you are trying to focus or study because they hold day cares and there's a dance studio in which they're sharing the space with. It's in a cool location and I had a great experience."}

{"text":"They shortchanged me a nickel and gave me the wrong muffin. The service and hot chocolate were both \"meh\". On the bright side, the muffin I did receive was tasty (apple)."}
