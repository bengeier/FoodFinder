{"text":"A decent substitute for Pita Jungle. Prices are a bit high for what you get compared to Pita Jungle. I have only ever gotten Togo food. I imagine it can sometimes be unpleasant to eat there. They allow Hooka smoking on patio. Even picking up my Togo food I have to brave the Hooka smell. Food is pretty good, just might wanna tweak a couple things."}
{"text":"we came in as 4 of us.once we saw the menu on the wall,we wanted to order almost everything.their size of the lahm el ajiin,is WOW.their manakeesh sandwich,is awesome.the tabulli is amazing.

the prices are WOW also.I had trouble finding the place,but at the end,it was in a good area,plenty of parking space.everyone was nice.especially charlie.he came out and brought us the food himself.I love charlie's garlic.thank you.we will be back, for some lebanese kibbi.WOW."}
{"text":"I can't think of any place I'd recommend more in Old Town.  I've only had the falafel, but it's wonderful enough to recommend the entire restaurant.  The staff is friendly, and service is pretty quick.  I prefer a carry out or alfresco dining, as sometimes they overdo the cleaning chemicals in the inside seating area.   The area is a vast wasteland of tourist trap shops and crap food, so lets just say this place is an oasis of sorts."}
{"text":"Ordered the gyro and hummus and pita bread. Everything was hot and freshly made. The service was good and everyone was very nice. The salad was the only thing that didn't look good and it was just \"okay.\" The pita was excellent and the hummus tasted fresh but I was hoping for a little kick to it. I wasn't impressed with the gyro. I've found a few other Mediterranean places in Vegas that I like better where the food looks and tastes equally good."}
{"text":"Tyied the kofta . There is no spices at all. Prices are high to vompare with other pkaces . I love meditrenean food but would like to eat tasty meditrenean food."}
{"text":"The amount of food you get for the price is amazing! Their babaganoush is awesome and so is the salad. Gyro also good! I would highly suggest checking it out!!! Pita pit is opening across the street and I'd hate to see them struggle because of a chain!"}
{"text":"We were wondering around looking for a bar and heard the music pumping out from this joint.  Went in and got a table in some make shift patio area.

The atmosphere and service was nice - everyone seemed to be having fun and chilling. Music they were pumping out, which was mostly middle eastern, was rather catchy and fun.

The actual set up was a bit poor - tables/chairs were plastic patio furniture and it actually backed onto their kebab house!  Which made it appear shabby.

However, on the whole I quite enjoyed the experience and having a drink and checking out something different.

I would def recommend for a quick drink and shesha.  Didn't eat there so not sure of the quality."}
{"text":"I have been a couple of times in the evening and always had a great time. Hands down some of the best falafel I have ever had! The hummus and baba ganoush was a little disappointing but they certainly made up for it with good hookah and fabulous belly dancing. The service is a little slow, but always friendly. I will definitely be returning to Pita House."}
{"text":"The best Lebanese cuisine in Las Vegas. You eat once and you become addicted. You can never avoid Pita House!!!"}
{"text":"I liked it until
teenagers took over and
killed our Jamaican"}
{"text":"I have been going to this place since it opened. Tonight I went for the last time. It seems as if they have cut the quality and kept the prices as high. The gyro meat came in cubes, and there was about half the amount there used to be, and not as tasty. The salads no longer came with the fried pita chips. They even changed the french fries. It was alright, but nowhere as good as it used to be. Shame for sacrificing quality!!!"}
{"text":"The food in this place was good (and their meat is halal). But that's all they have to offer. We had dinner at the patio, which was dark and the tables hadn't been cleaned well. The menu's are old and not all items can still be read. The waitress was unfirendly and unknowledged."}
{"text":"First and last! Should have known from the first moment with a filthy door, then we were seated at a table with a dirty table cloth and filthy bathroom! These were all clues that this was not going to be a good dining experience and sure enough, the food was HORRIBLE!  I can only imagine what the kitchen must have looked like!"}
{"text":"Got a greek salad and gyro and both were low quality, in preparation, taste and ingredients. The salad had little more than iceberg and romaine lettuce mixed with some large slices of tasteless tomatoes, an olive and a few slivers of onion. The dressing was not very good either.

The meat on the gyro was overcooked, processed slabs (I expect they them packaged frozen) and there was hardly any sauce or anything else in the wrap to balance the meat taste.

It was a to go order and I just ate some of it to curb my hunger, I was too tired from a very long day to go back. They may have made adjustments to the food if I was dinning there. But really it never should have left the kitchen in such condition if that wasn't how they usually serve it.  If this place was in Southern California, it wouldn't last 5 minutes with this quality Med food."}
{"text":"I tried this restaurant after searching for a good Mediterranean restaurant in my area.   The beef kabobs were delicious And very flavorful!!! I was greeted by a woman who was very friendly and asked me how the food was.  She was very genuine and sweet and explained the different types of meals they had.  The rice was a bit bland but the overall experience was great and the salad and meat was very yummy and tasty! I'll be back :)"}
{"text":"Lady not very friendly. Lost appetite while waiting for food n grumpy lady. I see why no one eats here but myself."}
{"text":"Their food is amazing, your treated like family the minute you walk through the door, and I don't think anybody makes better hummus than Susan the food and customer service is great.."}
{"text":"Amazing food and super friendly staff.   We stopped in on our way to Vegas to enjoy some great fresh Pita, hummus and Lamb.  Salad was better than typical greek style salad.  A definate stop on every driving trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"I eat here twice a week. It tastes great, generous portions, and friendly staff."}
{"text":"This place is great! I love the food here!

I had ordered the gyro. It comes with fries or rice and salad. The salad was really good for a little house salad. The fries were cooked just right. And the best part, of course, was the gyro. Meat was perfectly cooked and seasoned. The pita bread was fresh and lightly toasted. The tzatziki was amazing and fresh. Topped with tomatoes and lettuce, it was just delicious. I will be eating herw often."}
{"text":"LOVED this place. Great service and very friendly. The food  was fantastic! Our kids loved it as well. We got  the kabob chicken and steak plates, Spinach pie, kibbeh balls,  pita bread and baklava. I can't say a bad thing about any of them. GO you won't be disappointed...so good. We will go back."}
{"text":"This place has decent food. The gyro meat is really good and tender, and the dressings and tzatziki sauces taste homemade-- not sure if they really are or not. The lettuce always tastes like bagged cheapo stuff, though, and they only have bottled drinks-- no brewed iced tea or anything fancy. The restaurant is really small- with only three or four tables inside in the air conditioning. They have outdoor seating with misters, but I personally really hate sitting under misters. They have waitstaff, er ONE server, who double as a counter server, so it can be slow, but they are always very friendly. All and all, this restaurant is OK. I work close, so it's kind of nice to go here as a change of pace, but not on any sort of regular basis or anything.

Just a funny note: I did spellcheck here on yelp.com, and they suggested \"testis\" for \"tzatziki.\" ha!"}
{"text":"My family went to this restaurant today based on the 5 star rave reviews.  We were disappointed.  It is not even close to the quality and flavor of Crazy Pita!!  We waited a long time for the food and the prices were a little high.  My kids usually LOVE pita bread and they said it was flat and not soft.  Rice was bland and so was tsatziki sauce.  We won't be returning."}
{"text":"First time here and we loved it! My husband and I are both vegan and sometimes at smaller restaurants it is hard to find good vegan options. That was not the case here, they are very accommodating and pointed out all of the vegan friendly options on their menu. The falafel wrap and hummus are my new favorites, but honestly everything we had was amazing.  Everything is made fresh no preservatives or junk added in. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"I was driving around for business and wanted something different for lunch and stumbled upon this place. 

The atmosphere is pretty cool... Clean and simply decorated which I liked. The bar was nice and am thinking that it would be a cool place to start out and grab a couple drinks before a night out in old town. 

The food was good. I got the Kafta Kubideh Pita sandwich and it came with a salad. The pita sandwich was really good and I especially liked the grilled taste on the meat. The salad was ok, nothing special (shredded lettuce and dressing) All in all I liked the meal. The price was a little high in my opinion as my meal with a drink was 11 bucks and change. 

I'll go back when I'm around the area but won't be in a hurry to do so."}
{"text":"I just had the greek salad and pita w/ hummus... my life is now complete...if i would die this second, I'd be ok with it. Seriously though, i don't know if it was because i was starving it tasted so good or what but it was BOMB. I am gonna say that some olives in my greek salad would've been nice but no biggie. I will definitely be back, like maybe tomorrow..thank you Pita House!"}
{"text":"Great place for the weekend nights, drinks, foods, and dancing. Talented DJ, and the GM is a cool guy, female workers aren't that much. Keep an eye out for the owners. Overall, great experience."}
{"text":"We first came here the night that I moved into my apartment-my 2nd night in Vegas. We ordered a side of hummus and pita wedges. My mom ordered the beef and chicken kafta, my dad ordered a regular gyro and I ordered a deconstructed gyro. All meals come with a salad (the fattoush) and fries or rice. 

The hummus was amazing-definitely homemade. The pita wedges were warm and also tasted homemade. Yum!!

I tried the kafta and they were ok-not what i would normally eat but my mom loved it. It came with a really good garlic sauce. My deconstructed gyro was really good. The meat was tender and the tzatziki sauce was excellent!

My favorite part of the meal was the side salad-I made sure to ask then what it was before I left. It has lettuce, cucumber, green peppers, tomatoes and pita crisps topped with what tastes like lemon juice and olive oil. 

I've come back here numerous times now since it's so close to my apartment. The staff are always really nice and helpful. My favorite here is still the fattoush-which I now order every time. I tried the lamb kabobs the last time and they were cooked perfectly! Another new favorite!"}
{"text":"I have never had better Arabic food in Arizona before this. The owner was funny and personable and the food far exceeded my expectations. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Found this place on our way to the airport.  Haven't had Greek food this great in years"}
{"text":"Hit the spot w the gyro sandwich. Feta fries aren't on the menu but they do have it. Met the owner she insured us everything was hand made n it tasted like it.  A must go if in the area."}
{"text":"Great tasting food, reasonable prices and friendly staff ...I ordered today's special Lamb Kafta plate for $8.99, which had 2 lamb Sku , pita, rice and salad. The quantity was huge, I couldn't finish the meal and I'm a good eater.

My wife ordered humus $3.99 and 2 pita breads $1, they make fresh pita and humus...they were excellent ,"}
{"text":"Average food with extremely small portions. Not worth it at all. A 7.99 pita should have more than 4 small piece's of chicken in it. George's gyros is a much better choice. We wont be back!"}
{"text":"While this place has a good location and quick food preparation, the atmosphere is drab, it's patio dirty and dusty, and the food and pricing average.

The hummus lacks flavor and the meat proportions very skimpy on both the salads and gyros. The service outside is not great and seems, at least from our several visits there, that they are just under-staffed.

We are not hookah fans, but if you are, they offer a ton of flavors and crank up the music later at night so the patio is festive."}
{"text":"A good friend of mine and I went out for a bit on Saturday, and decided to stop by after hearing the music coming from Pita House! Im so happy we stopped in, because I was craving Tzatsiki!

The food was good, and cheap! The pita tasted really fresh :) Aside from that they had a belly dancer performing and the hookah bar was really busy. A group of people also came through and were doing some kind of traditional dance that was really cool to see.

Great vibe, energy and food. Ill definately be back."}
{"text":"Good food but not for the price I went in with my husband and our bill was 40.00 for 4 kabobs and drinks not included for this price I rather go to a restaurant!"}
{"text":"The beef kabobs are as tender and flavorful as I've ever had, and the hummus is ridiculously creamy and delicious. This place is tucked into a weird spot in a strip mall, but seek it out - it's worth the trip."}
{"text":"Bought catered shawarma for a child's birthday party and I was very happy. They've probably received a ton of requests for shawarma since a certain superhero movie came out a couple years ago. Nonetheless, the staff was helpful in taking my order and made good recommendations for my order. Food was made the morning of my event and everything was fresh and delicious. They even left a cute drawing on the container for my little one."}
{"text":"Food was ok not great and for an order of cheese pies, beef and chicken platter, vegetarian platter and chicken shawarma plate came to $63. A little much for take out."}
{"text":"Seriously, we've tried quite a few places.  This one is really awesome!  Most places don't make their pita bread fresh.  It is here!  This is NOT a chain.  It's a family restaurant, friendly, less expensive on average than most.  I think they need a better location to really succeed, but we are devoted :)"}
{"text":"I was craving for Greek food one night and we (brother & I) stumbled upon this establishment on Yelp. We decided to order almost everything off the menu to try and coz we were just starving. You cannot go wrong with the shawarma, both beef and chicken. If you're diet conscious, you won't even feel bad. I'm obsessed with their hummus with pita. It tastes so fresh. Also, the staff are really nice and welcoming. I will be marking this as one of my favorites in my area."}
{"text":"We arrived on a Sunday for lunch. I noticed it smelled of smoke....turns out it's a hookah lounge at night so yes, stinky. There was garbage, literally garbage, all over the floor by our table. The nice waitress said they hadn't cleaned up from the night before. She swept up while we waited for our order, but we still sat next to a table with a filthy tablecloth. Not appetizing. The food was okay, the waitress was cheerful and attentive, probably because she saw I was discombobulated by the atmosphere. I was trying to be a \"come with gal\" for my husband. The bathroom was nothing short of 3rd world. Gak. Two stars because the food was fine, but it scared me. I tremble to think what the kitchen looked like."}
{"text":"Super good food really nice people, the lady at the counter heard that i hadn't ever tried baklava and gave us some free of charge."}
{"text":"I freakin' LOVE this place.  Their hummus is outta this world, all of their kabobs are fantastic, and the Shawarma's are delicious.  This is my favorite Mediterranean place in Vegas.  

If you get it to go, they hook you up with EVERYTHING (plates, plastic-wear, basically everything you need) because the owner \"doesn't want you to have to do dishes... we want your meal to be as easy as possible\".  Simply awesome!! 

Do yourself a favor.... visit this place!"}
{"text":"The Greek Salad is fantastic, wide variety of fresh vegetables and non-pitted olives.   Huge portions for a reasonable price.  Their kabobs are solid, all of the meats I've tried have been charred outside and delicious and juicy inside.  Can't ask for much more from a take out Mediterranean place.

Friendly owners, knew my name and order the second time I came in."}
{"text":"This place rocks!!! I recently moved to Scottsdale and I am blessed to have this place!! Outside area is very relaxing, u will b smoking a hookah and getting your work done on your computer thanks to their free wifi (no code needed and no time restriction) I think they have a live Dj on the weekend!! Good is greaaat!! I love gyros, chicken or beef and the shawarma and hummus!! The cool thing is that I found out that they open to almost 4am on the weekend for take out!! Love it!! Feel like I am back on the NYC!!"}
{"text":"Ended up here after craving a pita. Very friendly staff and delicious food.  I had the beef shawarma and my husband had the chicken kafta. Both had us licking our fingers. Very good."}
{"text":"Food was amazing staff was great. I had the lamb and ended it with some baklava. My first time being here and it won't be the last."}
{"text":"Food was delish! Loved the salad with the crispy pita chips and the garlic sauce is amazing !"}
{"text":"Just bought by a new owner that has cut the portions by half but kept the prices the same. Order the small hummus and find out how small a serving of hummus can be. I would estimate that the schwarma has about 2 ounces of meat. I felt completely taken advantage of. I've never complained about portions before but I told our waitress that the portions were a total rip off. She was very nice and added some more hummus but even counting that, i think it was still very little for $6 hummus appetizer.

Ignore the good reviews, those were before the new cheapskate owner. Its obvious they are targeting tourists with high prices and low portion to get every penny out of them since they likely wont return anyway.

The new owner is obviously not just cheaping on the food, one poor girl worked the takeout section, the bar, and the restaurant. As far as I can tell she was the only one working on a Sunday at 1pm.  However, she was very nice and did the best she could. She was the only reason they got 1 star."}
{"text":"I've picked up a gyro from here before and couldn't really remember if I had liked it, so I stopped to grab something quick on my way back to work. I've read some reviews that say their falafel is good, which I can't speak to. I can say that the gyro, the side greek salad that came with it and the baklawa were overpriced and disgusting. The shredded iceberg that topped the gyro and comprised most of the salad was browing and reminded me of what subway would have thrown out .The baklawa was soggy. This might explain why they were completely empty and able to serve me quickly right around noon on a week day. I'd say the Schlotsky's two doors down would be a better and cheaper options. If I really want a gyro, I'll go the mall food court and get a cheaper gyro that actually tastes good from Pita Jungle."}
{"text":"Went last week for first time.  Ordered falafel pita which has hummus. They gladly substituted tomatoes for pickles it was huge and great.  Get the hot sauce.  That was dinner time   Today stopped for lunch had hummus pita   It was average  not much  hummus.  Inside is a dive.  Outside is fine, but not in the summer   Only like three tables inside   A couple walked in looked around and split.  So I give them 4 stars for last time, would have gone 3 today. But if you don't eat meat there are great options.  Get the falafel with hummus and you might be happy. But I can't guarantee anything.  Very polite staff"}
{"text":"Ok this place was great. Service was a little slow but maybe I was just impatient because I had a fussy baby. Looking at the menu I was worried it was a little pricey but I was wrong. You get SO much food for the price. Hummus and pita was amazing and seriously I have hummus for days!!!! I will return!!"}
{"text":"The food was ok, BUT I ordered chicken gyros and was given lamb gyros instead. We would have returned the food to exchange it but we live 20 min away and did not see it was lamb until we arrived home. The place also had a mild sewer smell."}
{"text":"Just visited first time. Wonderful food, great service, excellent prices. Since I am vegan it is always nice to see options for me to choose. I will return!"}
{"text":"I went here the other day with a friend for a much needed Friday happy hour/dinner.  I had checked out the other yelp reviews, and I really wasn't sure what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised.  

The food was really good.  The service was also good, but a little slow at first.  They give you ridiculously large glasses of water here, which should be standard everywhere you go...we do live in the desert, after all.  

The hummus was good.  I'm seriously in love with the babaghanouj, it had the best slightly charred smoky flavor.  The salad itself was unimpressive, but that garlic dressing they put on it is crazy good, and guaranteed to keep vampires and bad dates at bay.  

The hookahs smelled amazing; I'm definitely going to have to come back and try them sometime.  

They also have a little take out window, which is conveniently separate from the rest of the place.  I suspect I'll be ordering falafels from it in the near future.  I do have to dock a star for the bathroom, as it was small, and only half working."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. I ordered the chicken and steak Shawarma, it reminded me of home. They use only the finest ingredients with their olive oil that ships straight from Lebanon. I will definitely come back for more!"}
{"text":"This place is terrible!!!! Do not waste your time, they have the worst service I have ever experienced at any restaurant in my entire life!! They took over 40 minutes to fill my to go order and told me all other orders come before to go orders? What is the point of a to go order? The staff was extremely rude, I will never eat there again and recommend that those reading this do not either. Also their food is over priced and mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Amazing, one of my favorite places to eat around my house!! The tzaziki, and pita bread is amazing! I always get the beef, so this review is all for the beef kabobs! But, I continue to come back just for those!! Love it!"}
{"text":"Freshly made pita and fantastic lamb kabobs will bring me back. Also, loved the greek salad. The babaganoush was pretty good. The gyro while decent, I'll probably skip in the future because those kabobs were so damn tasty. Quick, fresh and fairly priced. Yep, I am a fan."}
{"text":"Great tasting food with friendly service, that's such a great combination for a fast food place."}
{"text":"2 stars go to food. Great food! Girl at front, not so great. No greeting as I came in. She kept her sunglasses on. I proceeded over with caution as I began to consider that she actually could be dead...that is until she reached over to her bag of pistachios and proceeded to crack one open and eat it in front of me. After a sigh of relief, I decided to initiate interaction to get the ball rolling. Told her it was my first time there and didn't know what to get. She responded with, \"gyros great\" as she continued to munch on her nuts. I decided on the chicken kabob...The restaurant itself, eh, a little uncleanly. Cute little place if they made an effort to wipe the grease from the ceiling and pay attention to people that want to give them money for food. May or may not be back...depends on if girl at front is still busy eating"}
{"text":"Decent Mediterranean at a reasonable price. First time here, thought I'd check this place out since they have pretty good reviews and it's close by my house. I chose the gyro wrap as my meal. Inside was the gyro meat, lettuce, tomato, onion and tzaziki (sp?) sauce. It was pretty good. You also get your choice of rice or French fries. I chose the fries and they were ok. Ordinary, run of the mill fries served in any restaurant. You also get a small side of their house salad which was pretty good ... I liked their dressing. The one thing that kinda spoiled it all for me (hence knocking off 1 star) was presentation. I'm sorry, but when I eat at a sit down restaurant such as this, I really would like to eat with a plate and real utensils. Food was brought out in a styrofoam box and plastic fork. That's ok for take out but when eating in, that's a no-no! Otherwise good was tasty and portions were just right. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"By far the best middle eastern restaurant in Las Vegas. Susan is an excellent woman who is so pleasant and fun to speak to. The food is all fresh and made to order. Nothing is ever Frozen. Sunday is their special day where they cook something special. I've been to two of them so far and I plan on going to more. I would highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Thank you for bringing the real taste of Lebanon to Henderson Nevada. Authentic. Love the speciality Lebanese dishes on Sundays. Wish they can be rotating special dishes on a daily basis but hey staying fresh and good is more important. Love this place. Merci Kteer!!!"}
{"text":"Best Greek restaurant in Las Vegas! Everything has been good and when we lived closer we went at least once a week! Since we moved we have had to try other places closer and pita house blows them out of the water! Highly recommend !!!"}
{"text":"Had a fantastic healthy lunch. I ordered the chicken Kabab platter, my husband ordered the chawarma beef sandwich and of course we had tabouli and eggplant baba Ghanouj. Everything was super tasty, no grease and only fresh ingredients. They offer very generous portions. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"This is an amazing find if you like healthy Mediterranean food. Secret Recipes from Mom.  You won't go wrong, Brenda and staff are incredible with their service.  Definitely coming back.   David & Marcie"}
{"text":"Has the best gyros in town. Also loved the beef skewers w/ the best rice I've had.  Even went back the second day"}
{"text":"Really cool environment to hang out with friends. Great music!! Would come here again."}
{"text":"Yuk-O. I work just down the street and read the reviews so thought it would be great. Wrong! They gyro was ok, but the salad that came with it was nasty, wilted lettuce with a brown slice of tomato and a blob of dressing. Their prices are too expensive for lunch and to top it off the girl working take out was totally snotty and rude when I asked some questions about the menu. This one is a pass for me."}
{"text":"I can't believe some of the reviews on here. My experience wasn't as good. First off I don't think the girl taking orders knew what she was doing. She got our order wrong. You either get rice or fries, my wife wanted half of both, NOT a substitution. They subbed the salad for fries. I had to tell them they messed up before she had to ask the owner for a small salad, what's the big deal??? Then I told them half my chicken was burnt. The owner couldn't believe it, he had to come to my table and argue with me. He ultimately said,\" how did you want it, raw?\" RUDE. Not going back here, bad service, plus food way too expensive for greek food. Go across the street to the gyro place. I felt bullied, unappreciated. They put the food in these tiny plastic to go boxes even when your eating in, imagine your fries in this tiny compartment in corner. FAIL!!!"}
{"text":"It's kind of nuts how much take-out business this place gets, and you'd never notice it just by driving by!

It's a simple Greek menu, with plenty of options for vegetarians like myself.  I usually get a pita sandwich with a side salad instead of fries, but last night I splurged and got the Vegetarian Platter.  For $10, you get basically 2 meals worth of food - good for sharing or in my usual case, being a total fatass and eating it (nearly) all.  The pita included with the Veg platter is notably thinner than traditional pita bread, but I actually prefer it (honestly, it almost seems like grilled tortillas but I know that's not right).  This way, you can save on the carbs as you scoop up some delicious baba and hummus.  The falafel here is much crispier than I've had anywhere else...and I love it!

Service is friendly and quick. Packaging for to-go orders has always been adequate...no spills on the drive home for me!

Bonus: parking is plentiful in the adjacent lot, and you can sit on the cozy patio while you wait for your order to be prepared!"}
{"text":"Great place to relax after a long week of work, the prices are very reasonable and enjoy the open air tables. Lots of fun, service is over the top!"}
{"text":"Just glancing at the other poor reviews on here, I'm willing to bet the young lady with the lousy attitude is the very same one we were unlucky enough to have serve us tonight. I don't think I've seen someone who was worse at hiding their contempt for service in a while. After serving only half the table their food and disappearing, trpuble calculating the bill, and multiple other mistakes, it truly seemed like we were really annoying her having to inquire about her errors. Passive aggressive, forgetful, apathetic and complacent, this otherwise fantastic Pita joint, really needs to do some staff-housecleaning."}
{"text":"5 of us ate here this weekend. 3 have fallen sick. One of my friends had to go to ER. 2 of us who did not eat dipping sauce and minced meat are doing ok. Please avoid the place and save your trip to hospital"}
{"text":"I found myself in downtown Scottsdale one evening after a long day at work. Extremely tired and way hungry, I started scanning for my options, and locked eyes on Pita House, because, well, I can never get enough of Middle Eastern food. 

Pita House is arranged in an odd way - there are small plastic tables on the asphalt out in front, which means you'd be eating in the actual parking lot, and small tables on the side, where in the back is a hookah bar with no one tending it nor anyone sitting there. Very empty and I'm a little doubtful if it actually fills up later in the evening. But at least they had Arabic pop music playing, which, I guess, is something better than nothing.

I didn't want to eat too heavy and greet folks I was meeting up with later half-asleep, so I just ordered the chicken kebab sandwich. I then sat on the side patio and hung out. My sandwich came about 5 minutes later and I'll first begin with the minuses:

* The Salad: I hate all that Costco shredded iceberg lettuce crap that so many places use as their side salad. If I want cole slaw, I'd go to KFC. This salad was extremely unremarkable. Bah.
* The Pita: It was cold and not all that special. Having the pita warmed up as well would have been a good touch.

And now the pluses:

* The Actual Chicken: Excellent. The seasonings were really tasty and the chicken was grilled just right - maintaining its juices and not drying out. I would have preferred to eat a plate just of full of these chicken pieces and nothing else. I think I'll get it as a plate special next time around. 
* Service: Very friendly and efficient, even though it was only one girl who was doubling as both the cashier/kitchen manager and the server. 

So three stars for now. More if I make it back for more meals and become impressed with the other stuff. But if you are in the neck of the woods and are looking for a decent, casual ethnic eating option that won't break the bank, try it out. I'd go back."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff. Lots of choices for Mediterranean food in vegas, but I'm hard pressed to find better"}
{"text":"If you want incredible food, visit the pita house! I always get a Greek salad with chicken & beef. The meat is delicious and melts in your mouth. The hummus is made in house & fabulous. Give it a shot. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I have been meaning to write this review for awhile. I absolutely love this place. I usually get the steak skewer but sometimes I will get the chicken and I am ALWAYS happy with either choice. The steak is very high quality and it is like biting into a piece of filet mignon. I love the lady at the counter. She recognizes my daughter and I and it really feels like I've come home and my mother wants to feed me. The baklava is out of this world, try the hummus and pita, you can find none better and please try the garlic sauce. Delicous!"}
{"text":"The food tasted great and prices are very reasonable. I had the chicken kabob, which is served with your choice of rice or fries, and salad. The chicken comes with a half grilled-tomato and raw onions, on top of a pita bread. I don't understand why serve raw onions on a kabob. It'd make more sense if the onions were in the salad. Also, the tomato released a lot of juice on the bread, which got soggy and inedible.
We also had an order of sambousek and didn't enjoy it at all. I had never had it before, but the meat filling is a little sweet and had a cinnamon taste."}
{"text":"This has to be the absolute worst Greek / Mediterranean food in all of Las Vegas. I was so excited to try it and find a new place close to my house and boy, was I wrong. I got the chicken salad... the chicken was slimey and repulsive. The salad was generic iceberg lettuce and was not a Greek salad in any shape or form. My boyfriend had the kafta... another dish we couldnt eat. There was chunks of fat hanging from the meat. Never again."}
{"text":"Fantastic, the hidden little jewel here. I ordered the lamb kabob, rice and salad. I is amazing. The lamb was lean and exceptionally tender, everything was prepared great.  Good place to eat!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Authentic, made fresh everyday and amazing. We tried many things and they were all great!! We will be back for more. Best Mediterranean place in silverado ranch, hands down.  The owner said \"we don't own a microwave or a can opener, everything is made fresh\""}
{"text":"We were from out of town and had an entertainment coupon for this place.
We were not sure what to expect but was so surprised as to how good it was.
The meat was very tender, rice tasteful, and salad very good.
Portions were very generous. The only down side was a limited dessert menu.
On our return we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"After being to quite a few places like this, I was very excited to find out this place was right near my house! This place is amazing. The meat is authentic and fresh and my favorite part, the pita is great! The taziki isn't quite to my liking, but it might just be authentic and I'm not used to it. Overall 5 stars, i always crave it!"}
{"text":"This used to be pretty good, now, not so much. The place smelled like cigarette smoke and spice. Not good. The windows were covered in handprints, the sidewalk stained with spills. The blonde waitress kept scratching her head, then went and put our stuff in a to go bag, yuck. I saw the guy preparing the food. He just reached in and grabbed some lettuce bare handed and stuck it in a to go box. That was kind of disgusting too. Real turn offs, I took the food but was too grossed out to eat it, so I just tossed it. No way I would return."}
{"text":"On the recommendation of a Yelp Elite friend we stopped in for lunch while on a quick trip to Vegas. The staff is super friendly and they have a great selection of food. We had a 3 year old with us and she enjoyed the food. We had the kabobs with french fries, hummus and the greek salad. Everything was great.

Know before you go:
There is another pita restaurant right across the street called Pita Pit, not the same thing at all.

{"text":"Love this place. I've been coming here for a while and the food is good. The Kafta kabob is good beef or lamb. Also, the gyro is good and they have been pretty genorous with the meat. I've tried different kabob places in the neighborhood and this is my favorite. It's worth a try."}
{"text":"Hubby and I just ate here. It was so good!!! You can not beat fresh pita. It was so good we ordered more before we left so we could eat it was our left over hummus. We will be coming back that's for sure :)"}
{"text":"Awesome lunch!  Gyros and lamb kafta were fabulous. Baba ganoush and kibbe were perfect.  We so loved the pita bread had to take some home!!!  Will be back!"}
{"text":"I can't believe only 1 waiter is working the front area. We waited for a while to get our order and ended up leaving since that was a bad sign. Who wants to eat food with secondhand smoke all over the place? Especially with a tutti fruity smell-gross. It's unsanitary to eat and smoke. Come on Arizona and pass a smokefree outdoor dining ordinance!  Nonsmokers make up this state more than smokers!"}
{"text":"I have been going to the Pita House since I was in high school. The food is insanely delish, they have the BEST hummus and falafel in town."}
{"text":"Great service, great people, delicious food! Had a last minute catering need and Elie came through! The food was like mama would make! Will definitely be back! Give this place a try, u won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Everything I have eaten at the Pita House is very good. My favorite is their daily chef special lamb kefta. The prices are more than fair for the amount of food they give you."}
{"text":"Is this place closed or open?  Closed on Thursdays or Closed for good?  I had a gyro craving.  I knew this was the closet place to my job to get a gyro.  I got there around 11:30, thinking I'd beat the lunch rush.  From the outside it looks pretty dusty and abandoned, but still.  Sometimes those kinds of places serves some of the best food! It was closed.  I literally walked around the entire building, trying every single door and they were all locked.  I looked through the dusty windows and for sure, no one was in there and didn't look like anyone has been there in a while.  The sign on the door says 11am - 8pm I believe.  I'm not sure of the closing time but it definitely said they open at 11am.  Needless to say, I didn't get to try Pita House because they weren't open!"}
{"text":"The food was horrible! I was expecting so much more, i ordered the chicken salad, which had one tiny skewer of chicken which was flavorless and burnt. My friend ordered a chicken shawarma and also said it wasn't good. I'll never be back. Yuck."}
{"text":"I've stopped by here a few times. You definitely get your money's worth. They serve generous portions at a great price."}
{"text":"Very confusing place is it a bar a Resturant a hookah bar oh wait it's all 3 
Food was ok for middle eastern food standards in az service was terrible and the place just feels dirty and disorganized I'm very surprised it's been open for so long.
I would vertically not eat there again"}
{"text":"Yeah, No. Small, under seasoned pitas. The falafel's looked like chicken nuggets, and were lacking flavor. Plus the meal was over priced. Disappointing, stay away."}
{"text":"Pita House is my favorite Mediterranean place in town. It's not just because they are located 5 minutes from me, it's because I feel that I get some of the best Mediterranean food in town.

This restaurant is located on the Southeast part of town, on the intersection of Silverado and Maryland. It's near an Autozone and the uber-foodie restaurant, Yuzu. The only way to get in is through Silverado Ranch, going west, so, keep that in mind.

As its' namesake states, pita is the one of the stars of the show. Sometimes, when I'm experimenting with different hummus or baba ghanoush recipes at home, I will just order some pitas from Pita House, because pita bread can be somewhat tricky to make. So soft and pillow-ey. I personally like the version that they serve here, its thinner, and almost like a big chip. But, don't sleep on Pita House' baba ghanoush or hummus, it is superb.

When I do order from here, I get the combo meals. Whether it's lamb, beef, chicken... shawarma, kebab, kafta, etc, everything I've ever ordered was perfectly cooked, seasoned spot-on, and was fresh. The rice pilaf that comes with it was nicely seasoned and fluffy, and the side salad was a nice touch. They offer competitive pricing, and I believe it's fair value. The service is always friendly.

This is my go to spot. I've been around town and haven't been too excited around town in terms of Mediterranean food, and I like what they do here."}
{"text":"Grabbed lunch to go from the Pita House the other day and it was delicious! I had the Beef Kabob Pita to go and loved it. The pita comes with a salad which has a terrific vinigarette dressing. The food was great and the service was quick and friendly although I will say the price seemed somewhat high for what I would get back in NYC for 6 bucks. I would go back but couldn't be a regular at over 9 dollars for lunch to go."}
{"text":"Food great! Intelligence of owner/staff (?) unbelievable. I waivered on wether or not to do this review, because if it were just for the food, I would have given it a 5, but the mood in this small place was, well, frightening. On my way home from a monthly doctors appointment, I saw a little Mediterranean Restaurant. I hadn't eaten all day and hadn't had Hummus forever, so decided to go in. The woman running the cash register was friendly & outgoing. I told her I would probably see her every month because of where they were located. She gave me a menu to take home with me and said if I called when I was leaving my doctor, she'd have my food ready when I got there. Wow, really nice! I sat down to wait and started watching CNN News which was on their TV. It was about Trump's statements that he would not be supporting Ryan or McCain. They also showed a clip of Trump telling a woman with a crying baby to take it out of the room he was speaking in. Anyway, there was a skinhead (I know this because he had a swastika tattooed on the back of his shaved head, not kidding here) yelling at the TV about Hillary being a crook. The woman came out and started yelling with him that Hillary was a murderer. YELLING! Both of them together. Inside of a fairly small space. The woman went back behind the counter to get my food (yelling on the way) and brought it to me, now sweet and nice as could be. After this, she went back to the skinhead and started shouting with him again. I ate about 1/2 of my meal before I couldn't take it any longer. I got a container to go. Couldn't sit and peacefully eat while this insane scene was actually playing out before my eyes. As I left, the owner sweetly smiled and said \"See you soon\". No, you won't. I don't care what your political views are, but you don't behave like this with customers in your establishment. Truly disturbing!"}
{"text":"Great family owned restaurant. Their hummus is so good and very fresh! I almost always get the Greek salad. The dressing is so good, I could drink it! Yum..."}
{"text":"Filthy, poor service, little food for the price, food was of low quality and only outside seating where you have to smell the nasty hookahs made it completely annoying and unappetizing to eat. Rarely critique any place but felt the need to post to save those time/money and avoid this place too many other great restaurants in old town. Got Dan Ramsey will be visiting this on kitchen nightmares I'm sure in the future not sure it can be saved though..."}
{"text":"Today I went to Pita House for a carry out order to take home. I ordered babaganoush, grape leaves or dolmades, and a shawarma sandwich on pita bread. The babaganoush and dolmades were really good! 

However, the shawarma sandwich was supposed to include beef and chicken; it only contained beef. The beef was tough and had a lot of connective tissue and gristles. The pita quarters served with the babaganoush was very thin and stale, unlike the good pita bread on the sandwich. 

I had hoped Pita House would be good because we love Middle Eastern food and it's located only 2 blocks from where we live. My wife liked it overall, but she agreed with my criticisms of the food. 

I'm sorry to say I'm not likely to go back to Pita House."}
{"text":"Great place, this place have the best hookah in town, great Mediterranean food with a Lebanese twist!! Definitely my new hangout in Scottsdale"}
{"text":"Was craving a gyro. Looked at some other places closer to my house but they all had poor ratings. I found Pita house, with a good rating and good reviews. It was about 6 miles from my house but I decided to try it. 

 The store is located in a small shopping area, but easy enough to find. 

When you walk in the place is clean and neat. Not to much over the top decor, and the smell was great. Made my mouth water even more. The meat was cooking on a spit, where they just shave off the meat and place it on the  grill to heat it up. So you know the food is fresh and cooked to order. 

I ordered the lamb gyro with extra taziki sauce ( not sure that's right spelling). My husband ordered the beef and chicken kafta plate. All dishes come with a salad, fries or rie. We got the fries. I also ordered the cheese pies. Was thinking of getting the spinach pies (maybe next time).  Got the food back home and I was really surprised how big my gyro was. It was way more then I expected. I was unable to finish it so I saved it for dinner. My husband is a southern guy so if it's not fried or smoother end in gravy everything is jus ok. I asked and he said it was good, so by his standards it was good and he would order it again. 

The staff that was working was very helpful and helped my choose my food. She was right it was all rally good and fresh. We will be back."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for years. It's cheap and yummy. And, located in downtown Scottsdale, that's a rare find.
For $5, the falafel sandwich is the best bargain. The falafel is crispy, and the sandwich is rolled up with hummus, tahini and tomato. It comes with a little iceberg lettuce salad that's unremarkable -- except for the tangy dressing (maybe sumac?) that makes it flavorful.
The actual falafel here is probably the best in the Valley. It's the only thing I've tasted that comes close to the home-made falafel my friend used to make for us all at bar time....that stuff rocked.

A few tips, though: First, don't bother parking in the parking lot. It's tiny and I've seen cars almost hit each other (or diners) on multiple occasions. Just park on the street. Also, order ahead. The service can be kind of slow, so just go online and order about 10 minutes before you get there.
If the weather is nice, it's a great place to eat outdoors."}
{"text":"they get a 5 star from me. Place is clean, the staff are really nice, food is served to order and fresh, prices are reasonable, I love coming here to eat Mediterranean food"}
{"text":"Terrible service, but the best food you can get. Try the garlic dip, it's the chef's special recipe. Nowhere in Phoenix Is better than this place."}
{"text":"Yucky. I wish Yelp allowed me to rate \"no stars\" because I would for this restaurant. It took 10 minutes for one of the worst meals ever. The shawarma resembled a dog turd and tasted raunchy with mushy vegetables and the sauces tasted rancid. I would have taken it back but was in a group of people who ordered from the sandwich shop next door. They forgot the hummus in the sandwich and the tabbouli salad had none- I repeat NO bulgur in it. Stale pita and easily one of the top 3 WORST places I have ever eaten at, in both service and quality of food. This is a place that deserves to not stay in business."}
{"text":"I like to get the gyro sandwiches or the chicken Kabob wrap to go.  Lunch special includes a small salad and it is tasty and quick. Healthy option in that area."}
{"text":"Some of the best Mediterranean food in Las Vegas! The \"old world favorites\" manakish taste as good as they do in Lebanon."}
{"text":"The food is bomb. Atomic style. 

Ok, it's not spicy at all, but it is freaking delicious.

I had one hell of a goose chase trying to find some chinese food on this weeknight. It's past 9PM on a Monday, and I can't find anything decent. It's Scottsdale, so my only choices are: Panda Express in Mesa, Jimmy Woo's (no thanks, eww), or go hungry. I settled, and drove to KFC thinking that if I was going to settle for something other than Chinese, I could get a double down, and try and go all suicidal. 

Then KFC let me down by forcing me to wait 10 minutes because all their filets were frozen. Eff that noise. I drove around aimlessly and somehow stumbled upon Pita House. It was like a sight for sore eyes.

I've lived in Scottsdale for just over a year. I've been out and about in the area quite a bit, but for some reason I've never actually been to the Pita House. Probably because it does look a little weird. 

I guess I shouldn't judge a book by it's cover, because this place was awesome.

Tonight, I ordered the Chicken Shawarma with an extra chicken skewer. It came with a side salad. I was pleasantly surprised to find a very thick garlic sauce (very similar to the one at Zankou Chicken in LA, see my review). Amazing. So garlicky, citrusy, and perfect.

The chicken was moist and juicy. The kind that makes you want to put your mouth all up in it. Mmm hmm. Yeah. It's very nice.

My meal was about 10 bucks. I devoured everything set in front of me. 

If you are into Hookah, they have hookah specials from 4-9, and also, some sort of lunch special for Gyros.

If I wasn't moving away, I'd be here more often.

Next time I am in Scottsdale, I will eat here, and grab some Falafel. Seems like people like it.

Lastly, the staff seems very nice. The guy who helped me (I think he was the owner) was super cool and friendly."}
{"text":"The service is absolutely outstanding. This restaurant is so casual and the food is delicious! I recommend it to any and everyone who wants to know a good place to eat in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"In our quest to fulfill my Greek food cravings, we tried this place. Absolutely the worst Greek food I've ever had. I should've went back to Yanni's across the street that serves authentic Greek food, with great flavors no matter what I order from them. Not to mention the huge servings. Pita house was so disappointing. I ordered the beef shawarma, my husband ordered the Gyro sandwich. My wrap was very bland, meat was tough. I had to keep adding hot sauce to add flavor to it. The salad was HILARIOUS. And the rice was completely bland. I took a bite of my husbands Gyro sandwich and almost broke a tooth from how hard the meat was, and not to mention it was cold! We are definitely not coming back here. Don't waste your money, instead head to Yanni's across the street. They never disappoint me."}
{"text":"Got a groupon for this place ....even with the Groupon felt like the value was not there...falafel was not fresh and chewy..."}

Didn't tell us you can only use 3 credit cards per party when we sat down, broke the news after we were already trying to pay. Cocktail pretty sure didn't have any alcohol in it, tasted like a strawberry listerine strip. Amazing food though"}
{"text":"Love their Vegan and Vegetarian options. Baba Ganoush and hummus with fresh baked pita bread was so good! I also loved the spinach pies with hot sauce. If you're on your way to a vegetarian or vegan diet this place makes it super easy!!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with the wife.  Food was great.  Chicken was good. Sauce was original.  The have tabouli, spinach and meat pies.  Although they weren't like my grandmas they were still good.  Staff was pleasant and customer friendly.  Even came out to see how dinner was.  Wife's last word were \"That was sooo Yummy\""}
{"text":"What great food!  I've lived in the Middle East and this tastes exactly the same!  So delicious and so much food!!!"}
{"text":"So food was ok, but i think the cooks need to understand that when u ask for med on the steak, this isn't what one is looking for.   Odd the lady said this is how they make It here if they want med, clearly you need to know this before ordering .   What struck me as odd, is a few of the chunks had a little red.   Which leads me to believe that she tried lying  to  make me feel better about my burnt meat .  Just admit you burned the meat ..."}
{"text":"Yuck. The chicken tasted more like the grill than the meat itself.  The \"salad\" was shredded lettuce with dressing, no veggies.  The location is great, so I'm a little disappointed the food wasn't better."}
{"text":"Went here last week with a friend. The place was decent and the food was fairly good. I got the chicken shawarma pita, and it came with a salad which was a really good vinaigrette dressing on it. The problem I have with this place is one that multiple others have mentioned, is that YOU GET CHARGED FOR WATER. On weekends they do not give water, except for bottles, and there's a $2 charge for it, the same as iced tea. This place would easily be 4 stars if it wasn't for that, but they lose one just for that oddity. Though, I have been to a few Mediterranean restaurants in the past that have done this, I still don't know how they can get away with it.

When we were there, there was one man sitting by himself on his computer smoking hookah (maybe eating as well?) and another man who seemed to be a friend of family member of the owners, because he was just sitting there watching old middle eastern television and had people coming and going talking to him. I'm not sure how this place stays in business."}
{"text":"Love love the pita house!!! Fresh food very authentic. Best Mediterranean on this side of town."}
{"text":"This is the worst place We have ever been to in Scottsdale.  The service was terrible and the gyro wasn't even real gyro meat!!! We were all disgusted and completely disappointed with the pita house, the service, the staff and the overall appearance of this club, restaurant or homeless hang out!!! we haven't really decided which one to call it yet. The Better business bureau gives this place a rating of zero and would like to see this business no longer tarnish the image of our beautiful city....."}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean food in Las Vegas. There is nothing on the menu that I don't like. It's gonna make my move to Las Vegas more comfortable.  The prices are great and the service is excellent. Go there...don't be afraid! lol."}
{"text":"My first time there . I may stop back another time just to check out the Shwarma and because I like to give restaurants a fair shake but the babaghanouj was REALLY bad. Also the girl at the front charged me $6.48 for the baba to go and when I gave her $7 she said \"its 6.48 but I don't have the .52 cents change. Is that ok?\"  Puzzled  I asked \"why don't you have the 52 cents? At this point she seemed almost put upon that I would even question. She then opened the cash register, pointed to the empty change drawer and bluntly said \"we dont deal with change.\" I said ok
but thought it was really an obnoxious practice as a ploy to get  tips on the to go food...If I had any inclination to throw her a tip it would have been more than the 52 cents she weaseled so she's screwing herself in the long run. Not to mention that I found it so unprofessional that it left a bad taste in my mouth along with the baba."}
{"text":"Went for lunch as I was craving a hardy gyro. I hadn't  been here for quite some time and I'm pretty sure the gyro wasn't any thing like they serve now. 3 slices of dry precooked packaged meat slapped on a grill  rolled in a dry pita, sauce, lettuce and onion   With a side salad. Not even a light lunch. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Moved into the area a month ago. Went to try this and the sign says they are open till 8pm but the doors were already locked at 7:20pm. I won't try to come again."}

{"text":"My favorite place!!  As I am eating I am wondering when I can come back again.  I have gone to other medeterrianan restaurants and I always compare them to Pita House!!  I LOVE their Gyros and their house salad.  Delicious.  The staff is super friendly as well.  If you are looking for a super yummy place that won't break the bank come here!!!!!"}
{"text":"Got the chicken shawarma, it was delicious! Added bonus was how healthy the entire menu is, definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Been to a lot of hookah places around the valley. Pita House takes the cake on service, friendliness, and their hookah tastes better and last longer than any other place I've been to. I don't really like middle eastern food so I've never ordered if here. But I'm sure it's great!"}
{"text":"If you're lucky you'll get subpar service. Went there with two girlfriends and wanted separate checks.... Ended up waiting 45 minutes until WE had to go up and get a manager involved. It took an additional 15 minutes and 2 other managers until we got our checks paid. And all they had to say was \"we're sorry, we're understaffed.\""}
{"text":"My coworker is always raving about their Shawarma salad and today I found out why she's always raving! It's the only thing I've tried so far as this was my first time, but the chicken Shawarma was AMAZING and the portion they give is huge! I'm definitely trying this place again. The folks who run the place are really nice too. Of course that makes all the difference. I got great service here."}
{"text":"This might be the worst place on earth. I've never experienced more incompetence and lack of customer service. Please only go here if you enjoy waiting endless amounts of time for nothing to happen."}
{"text":"Wish this spot was closer- friendly family owned and operated spot has fresh, flavorful Mediterranean food for great prices. Staff openly state that there are no microwaves, can openers, etc. on site- everything is made fresh to order.

Apps are shareable, with several pies (spinach, meet, cheese options) coming in 4-piece orders. The spinach variety has a heavy lemon flavor to it and does not include feta, as spanakopita would. The chicken shawarma wrap was an ample amount of chicken wrapped in a super-soft pita, sided with soft yellow rice and a small salad. Ask for extra garlic sauce! 

The best item though is the kabob salad- a giant Greek salad topped with your choice of beef, chicken, or lamb kabobs. Lamb is my preference, medium rare, with feta and onion on the salad. Dressing is amazing, I think it's a red wine vinagrette? Different from usual Greek dressings, in a delicious way.

NOTE: If you're unfamiliar with the area, don't go to Pita Pit by accident! Keep driving and it's in the AutoZone plaza."}
{"text":"This place is just gross. A friend and I had the day off and wanted day hookah where we can relax and enjoy the day without doing it our selves so we came back to Pita house being it's basically the only hookah spot opened during the day and let me tell you it's my last time I will be there. We wanted to watch a game on TV and there TVs weren't working they have like more than 4 and I guess they didn't have cable or something. We decided to sit outside after sitting down and being the only people inside I saw flys everywhere it was so gross and like those small food flies that are just flying around me I was grossed out so I said let's go outside. So we sat outside and got charcoal once and I went and grabbed my own because I couldn't see any workers. This place just needs a new makeover from the inside and out and staff. This place really sucks. Never going back to be honest."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the worst places I've eaten or try to eat at last time I ordered hear my debit card got compromised and somebody stole the number and spent over $1,000 this time I ordered for pickup lady said it would be 15 minutes I get there and she had no idea what we were talking about or even about our order finally she looks around to see that we did call in an order and told us it would take another 15 minutes aside from all of that their customer service is something to be desired they were extremely rude with all of the issues that we've been having"}
{"text":"Pretty empty at lunchtime on a Tuesday, but that just means quicker takeout for me. Tried the falafel sandwich served with the side salad and the total was under 6 bucks. The falafel was traditional with no cilantro and it was a good ball. It was rolled into the pita bread as is normal (i still yearn for the old school pita pockets) and it included hummus, tahini and an unusual dose of pickles. I really liked the sandwich, it was just good solid food, not the best falafel ever, but if you are craving this item, it is good and priced right at this location."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and food but super slow service, pricey drinks, and sometimes you never receive your hookah. Idk if the new ownership knows how to run a smooth service. I miss the old staff and prompt happy service.

The good things... belly dancers are entertaining; when you do receive a hookah, it's great, the food is very good and fast once you get to order.  It's too bad they can't get the service to be a little better! Could be an amazing spot!"}
{"text":"I recently went to Pita House since it was so close to my house and needed to get my hummus \"fix\". The people working there are so genuine and kind. I ordered for pick-up since they don't have a delivery person right now. The food is excellent! The chicken was juicy and seasoned just right, the fresh pita was unlike any I have had prior and I doubt I will be able to go back to the plain stuff. Based on other people's reviews I made sure to order the garlic sauce and in hind sight wish I had never tried this because now I am addicted to two dips! Their Hummus is creamy and drizzled with a beautiful aromatic olive oil. Needless to say I will be back and referring friends."}
{"text":"If the people who work there are not the owners, you wouldn't know. They seem to really care. Customer service is really good. Very friendly. Food is really good as well. One of the best places in Vegas"}
{"text":"The good reviews are long gone. The food is terrible. The absolute worst excuse for a gyro I have ever had. Where's the meat, and no feta. Slimy mayo covers the lettuce and tomato. It took nearly 30 min for them to make it AFTER I ordered it and drove there... I want my $8 back but I ordered takeout and am left with nothing more than soggy bread, and lots of mayo on dried out meat. Garbage."}
{"text":"Indeed one of the best Mediterranean restaurants in town! The Greek salad dressing is authentic and delish. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Pita House is quickly becoming one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas. They've got me craving it often but I don't feel bad because their food is every bit as healthy as it is delicious. Everything is made fresh and in house including their bread. There isn't a can opener on site and nothing is processed.

I'm in love with their tabouli salad (see photo). It's been absolutely perfect every time I've ordered it. The beef kabob skewers are also great with their famous garlic sauce. It's a must try! I've ordered their gyros and those are yummy too. They serve theirs on a pita and not that thicker flatbread like I've had at Greek restaurants. Possibly because their food is Lebanese and this is a different style. I have no complaints though. Just wanted to point out that it was uncommon to me. Regarding the rest of the menu, I haven't gotten too adventurous with that yet so I can't comment. However, this is one of those places where I am willing to bet that everything on the menu is good. Next thing I plan on trying is their hummus. I was with a friend that ordered that and it looked amazing!

Service is excellent and staff is all friendly. 

Random Quirky Fact - Apparently the cast of TLC's Sister Wives are fans too. You'll see their autographed promo card near the cash register. And all this time I assumed they lived in Utah..."}
{"text":"You can taste the love in every bite.  This place is very high quality.  My personal favorites are the vegetarian pizza and the lamb plate.  My uncle turned me onto the Pita Pit and we eat there  least once a week.  Theres love in the food,  a gem in the desert.  Thank you Pita Pit."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise! 

I had the gyro plate with a side of hummus. The pita bread is fresh serves warm and the hummus was delicious! 

The pita plate came with a salad and your choice of rice or fries for under $10. A great deal!

The salad had the right amount of dressing on it, bell peppers, but what really made it good were the pita croutons! I would order those by themselves and keep for snacks. 

The rice was cooked perfectly and was buttery.  It wasn't overly spiced like a lot of restaurants do. Good job.

The pita was fantastic! Everything was fresh and it really made the entire pita explode. One of the best I have ever tasted. 

The restaurant is tucked away in a little strip mall and I probably wouldn't have found it without yelp.

The interior was clean and the staff was super friendly. They asked how the good was after I started eating and explained that everything was made fresh and no preservatives. 

A strong \"recommend\" if you want to try some great Mediterranean food!"}
{"text":"Poor service. Dry chicken kebabs... served and then asked to pay for things you don't order. Wrong order.. decent hookah.
1 star sounds about right. Don't go here. Try some other spots in old town. They are way better"}
{"text":"The Lowdown: bad falafel, decent hummus

Went here in search of a falafel fix. What I found was a place whose falafel is in need of a fix. It was dry, tasteless and crumbled throughout the pita. I kept looking at it, sampling small pieces of it, and trying to decide if they'd given me the right sandwich.  They had. It was sad. 

It was a meal I will soon forget. At least I hope to. The only thing memorable is its place as the least tasty falafel to ever hit my palate. 

Service was attentive and the hummus was pretty decent."}
{"text":"I decided to give this place another chance a few weeks ago. Bad idea
Hummus was spoiled and sour and the guy totally forgot my pickles which I asked him for extras of. Instead he gave me extra olives which I can't stand, so overall it was a pretty gruesome lunch"}
{"text":"Slow service. Poor ambience. Waiting for a single kabob. Will not come back here. Also, chairs are dirty."}
{"text":"Good food and the lady at the counter was super sweet. Definitely want to eat there again  before I go home."}
{"text":"Only customers for lunch.  Over an hour and not served had to take it to go. 
Kitchen staff was outside on the hookahs.  
Waitress asked what did we expect?"}
{"text":"I won't be returning here. I ordered a Gyro wrap and fries,25 minutes later my order still wasn't done. They weren't even busy, maybe 3 tables were occupied. Customers that ordered after me were served their order. After 25 minutes I went up to the cashier to inquire about my order, she gave no explanation or apologies. I didn't receive my food until 32 minutes after I ordered, 1 wrap and 1 fries. Their customer service sucks."}
{"text":"Great hookah... If you have about three hours to spare! This place is really on a downward trend when it comes to their quality and service, which is disappointing to see because I've been coming here for as long as I can remember. I keep coming back to give this place another chance, but somehow every visit gets considerably worse. My party was seated on the patio and there was only one other gentleman sitting outside. We put in our order for just a hookah which came pretty quickly, but was not to my specifications. Then the two only two employees that seemed to be working that afternoon walked by us several times without so much as asking if we needed anything. Again, there was only one other gentleman there, so I don't believe there is a valid reason for the lack of service. Eventually, a server walked by and I asked her to get someone to bring us new coals. We did get new coals... About 35 minutes later, at which point we had to leave. After this experience, I have decided to finally give up on this place."}
{"text":"I REALLY wanted to LOVE this place.
I was soooo excited for some authentic baba Ganoush and bread, and I ordered the Veggie Platter w falafel, dolmas, and baba Ganoush. Side salad and bread came with. 
Hmmm...at first my eyes thought I hit the jackpot, but a few bites in and I was sadly disappointed. 
The falafel was really fried and all crunch no flavor. The baba Ganoush was not whipped
enough and I got some hard eggplant seeds in a few bites, the bread was totally flavorless, the Dolma seasoning was a weird sweet flavor, and the pickled veggies tasted chemical-ish. Total sadface...total disappointment. 
Also there  was only one other customer in the place but the lady behind the counter was in a major rush with me and not very helpful. 
Definitely won't return..."}
{"text":"Yummy food! I'm not an expert in Mediterranean food or anything, all I know is the beef kabob was deeeelicious! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"OMG I'm dying for their falafels and dolmades! Very good place for to-go orders. The host lady is super kind and knows what she's talking about. Oh, and did I tell you about their baba ganoush? Their choice of kabobs is huge, from chicken to beef, and lamb, and even vegetarian! Yummy. I'll definitely go back there to try more items from their menu."}
{"text":"5 stars for AZ. As someone who's been to the Mediterranean and lived in Detroit, I know that it is possible to achieve a higher nirvana of Middle Eastern food. At the same time, some of Pita House's dishes (like the Chicken Shawarma sandwich, for example) are pretty much there. The interior seating area could be more comfortable and the hookah scene can be avoided altogether. Still, this restaurant is an absolute gem for enjoying a magnificent dish in the outdoor courtyard or via their quick and easy take-out."}
{"text":"Had lunch here on a recent visit to Scottsdale. 

I've had a decent amount of falafel in my time and this was good. Instead of big balls of it, there were smaller pieces which meant more crispy bits. Ok by me! It lent a nice texture to the hummus/tahini/pita. The pita was nice and soft and chewy contrary to other reviews I glanced over. The side salad left a bit to be desired- just iceberg lettuce with a light dressing. If you get tap water, they bring you a HUGE cup of it. Like, Big Gulp-style.

We took advantage of the nice weather (with a breeze!) and stayed and ate outside. Not particularly impressive since it's basically in a parking lot, but I had my back to it, and they seem to be doing the best they can with what they've got."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Fresh baked Pita to order. the Hummus is so close to my home recipe it is amazing. Great Kafta and Kabob, the rice is perfect and the salad side is so flavorful. The cheese pies have a great balance of spinach, feta and pastry. I could just eat fresh baked PITA AND HUMMUS ALL DAY LONG."}
{"text":"Got the beef kabob plate and it was very flavorful. It comes with rice and salad, but wished it also came with hummus like most places. Husband got a falafel and I didn't care for it much. I would come back again."}
{"text":"Recently discovered and absolutely love!  An authentic middle eastern place that serves some of my favorite Lebanese apps. Freshly baked pita comes out piping hot and per order. Hummus was a little bland/tahini heavy, but I still gobbled it up.  The Zaatar is my go-to here.  Well done!  You're on my rotation :)"}
{"text":"Was just in here. I can't believe I haven't been here before being I live so close! It was delicious. Super friendly there and everything had amazing flavors. The hummus is absolutely delicious. And so is the chicken kabob plate. We did not leave hungry ;)"}
{"text":"I think the low reviews for Pita House are based on cleanliness and maybe the fact that all seating is outside but that said, I really like their food! It is authentic and I can honestly say they have the BEST baba ganoush that i've ever had! 

My husband and I popped in here after a night out and needed a bite but ended up with the baba ganoush, some hookah, and a beer! I hadn't smoked hookah since high school and it brought back so many memories! We ordered a peach concoction of some sort. The service was super friendly and we left happy! :) 

Yesterday, I was in the area and needing a bite and remembered how tasty the baba ganoush was so I popped in and ordered it for lunch, along with a simple Greek salad. The salad was tasty too! It had a ton of veggies and I loved the homemade dressing. It is definitely different in the daytime but the food is still good!

Anywho, we'll absolutely be back, if anything just for the baba! YUM!"}
{"text":"As a man from the UK it is nice a discover a great place to eat that offers such a good mix of food including vegan.  If there is one place to visit this should be it.  Fast, friendly. Good value and good food"}
{"text":"Awful service and unfriendly staff. 

We were greeted by an unpleasant hostess who didn't smile and behaved like she is doing us a favor. Then a waitress came by and took our order verbally and didn't bother asking us if we wanted a drink. 

Never going there again. I would have given them NO STARS if it was an option. Oh, and the hostess was smoking hookah while serving us. 

AWFUL."}
{"text":"When asking at the local Maronite Church where the BEST Lebanese food in Las Vegas is....everyone gave us this place. We have been beck Many many many times and everything was excellent. Not always the fastest food prep since it is fresh so we like to call ahead because they may be busy, but that is the only negative thing I can say. I am half Lebanese so this food is \"just like Grandma makes\"! Not big on ambiance but the food is the best!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome for starters. 
I've been on this kick to try new things and I'm so glad my boyfriend came across this place! 

We walked in and everything already smelled so good. The lady at the counter went over our different options and we decided on the 3 meat kabob plate (chicken, beef and lamb) this came with your choice of fries or rice and a salad! 

We also ordered pita bread and hummus to start. 

While waiting for our food they brought us out fresh made spinach pies on the house! (They were delicious!)

Then we got our hummus and pita bread. The bread was freshly made out of the oven. The hummus was perfect as well. 

Then we got our meal and everything was so delicious! The chicken and beef were my favorite and flavored perfectly! There was vegetables that complimented the meat as well! They also had a wonderful garlic sauce that was perfect for dipping the meat. 

We ended up taking the meal home because it was too much for the 2 of us! An extra order of pita bread was only $1.00 and so worth it! 

I can't wait to come back next time!"}
{"text":"Zaatar and cheese pies are great, very tasty and huge. Very nice people. 
I tried zaatar and vegetables for the first time and I love it. I'm sure the rest of the menu are very tasty too. I love there bread. Will be back for sure. Keep it up"}
{"text":"I have found the restaurant that I have been looking for. This place is amazing. The lady that was there is super nice and the quality is excellent. Highly recommended! I had the beef shawarma."}
{"text":"Really disappointed. Walked in and wasn't even sure what to do. The guy behind the register looked like he was dying and didn't even stand up to greet me or take my order. He just sat there and looked at me like I was bothering him to take my order. 

No please, no thanks, no nothing. Just an unhealthy, miserable employee who dragged the place down the second I walked in. He did the same thing to the guy after me too. Definitely won't be returning to this toilet bowl..."}
{"text":"Love it here, I usually order to go, but preferably better to eat the food hot. It's a family style run business and very authentic cuisine compares to other Mediterranean style joints. My personal recommendation is the combo platter with medium rare beef and chicken kabob with rice, salad, pita bread and their delicious garlic sauce on the side. The only down side is that they close earlier so if your schedule can accommodate coming a little early to try it out, I would recommend to!"}
{"text":"Excellent portions, fresh food, quick service, clean family place, Steady business during lunches. I ate here 3x b4 I wrote this review.  A must try 4 everyone!"}
{"text":"Grossest chicken shawarma ever. Slowest service imaginable. Don't even consider going here. The only good thing was that they served it in a nice plate and not a bunch of lousy styrofoam"}
{"text":"Really, really good. Staff is very proud of the product, and it shows. If only I had a bottomless stomach and a bottomless wallet I would get 1 of each item."}
{"text":"I stopped here for lunch today. Good gyros - not real cheap, but the lunch classic gyro is quite fair. The service was good - I had my food fast. Seating is outdoor so be prepared. Today is spring day in 90s, so not bad in shade. Actual mid east music is nice touch.
I read some of the other reviews, and I didn't see any issues with cold food or cleanliness."}
{"text":"Although we have lived in the area for 20 years this was our 1st visit. We are new to this type of food and really enjoyed our choices. A family owned business that happily explained and recommended menu items for us. High quality of food and portion size more than expected. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food is SO good here, however the service is always questionable. Today I had the horrifying experience of showing up to pick up my take-out order and there were two credit cards belonging to other customers just lying at the front counter unattended. I was left alone with them for over two minutes and when someone came to help me, they asked a server who they belong to. I could have swiped them and no one would have known. I'm terribly alarmed at this restaurants lack of concern for other people's credit cards. I will NEVER use a credit card here after what I saw today. In fact, not sure I'll return as I am so upset about it. Totally despicable behavior and ignorance."}
{"text":"If I can give a negative rating I would. Not even sure where to begin with this place....chicken kabobs can be used as weapons. The focilized chicken is absolutely tasteless and rock hard. The servers (with a few exceptions) only serve attitude with a side of eye roll. Most don't know how to make gin and tonic and it takes close to an hour of continuously asking to get your drink. Bootleg vodka like Kamchatcka is a separate thing all together. 
VIP service means getting physically assaulted by staff and the owners doing nothing about it. 
And talk about being overcharged and liable for other people's drinks. It happens all the time because the severs are like a bunch of special ed kids running around tripping over their egos too lazy to give a damn. 
STAY FAR FAR AWAY! There are two other hookah places around and I would take your business there."}
{"text":"I was intrigued by the great reviews of Pita House. A good middle eastern restaurant is difficult to find. 

Unfortunately, Pita House falls short. Falafel was not very good. Tastes bland and a bit stale as if it was sitting around for awhile. The pita bread was not fresh at all, way too chewy.  The service was actually really good.. Maybe I caught them on a bad day, because the place looked authentic and the reviews seemed favorable.

I was very disappointed.

By the way, my standard for falafel is Mamoun's Falafel in Manhattan, NY with 1000+ reviews. That's how falafel is done..."}
{"text":"Really good place !!! Very friendly staff... i had the chicken kafta and my husband had the chicken kabobs .. both were really good .. the rice was delicious and the hummus was perfect ... definitely will be coming back !!!"}
{"text":"This place has grown on me a bit. I've been branching out slightly, and trying more thing. The chicken shawarma is fantastic. They also have really great salads.

If you are a germaphobe, you might want to skip this place. A lady took my order, accepted my cash, and proceeded to make my meal without washing her hands. She did put on one glove, which she used her other dirty hand to apply. When the phone rang, she answered it with the hand that had the glove, took a phone orders and went back to making my meal without washing her hands or changing her glove. The health district gave them an A rating, which I don't understand. I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"The best Lebanese food in town, The place is always clean and fresh. Service is amazing."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Mediterranean food and without a doubt this is one of the best I have had. They bake pita to order and their rice is to die for! Anything you get you won't be dissatisfied!"}
{"text":"For all you alliterates out there. I've experienced quite a line of lackluster lunchroom locations as of late, and I'd like to learn what little leprechaun is leaning their bad luck my way.

With that out of my system. I've got to say this place has got the market cornered on mediocre. A quick visit to their official website shows a claim of \"Voted #1 Mediterranean/Middle Eastern ...\" I assure you, they did NOT get my vote.

As far as the service was concerned; we were one of two tables seated about 6 - 7pm on a Wednesday, the waitress visited us 1) to take our order, 2) deliver our drinks, 3) drop off / pickup our check. Someone from the kitchen delivered our food. Our waitress didn't seem rude during the few times she did swing by, but also wasn't excited for us to be there.

We started with an order of hummus, which turned out to be neither here nor there, then ordered a Gyro Plate and Kafta (Kubideh). The gyro meat seemed pre-packaged and the kafta (grilled ground beef) seemed underspiced and bland. We did; however, order a tasty chicken skewer side, which was good. 

Nothing about this meal was really fantastic and I definitely not worth coming back. I'm guessing they do most of their business during late night after people have had too much to drink to realize they're eating a sub par meal.

Be sure to let me know where your favorite Gyro is, 'cause I'm still looking!"}
{"text":"one of the best hookah lounge in AZ , i like their shawrma as well diffidently will recommend it to my friends and family"}
{"text":"Had lunch here early afternoon.  From the outside you are fooled a bit as this establishment is housed in the \"Old Town Pueblo\" looking building next to a tattoo place and Schlotzsky's.  You are fooled into thinking this might be a half-ass run pita joint.  However, the only fooling once you step inside is the faux old world walls and fixtures; so Vegas-ish.  I did notice a windex smell upon entering.  I took that as a good thing vs. a bad thing although it was a little nasty to waff.  Otherwise this place is pretty authentic Lebanese.  I had the hummus appetizer along with the chicken kabob sandwich, both were yummy.  I always get a little shy trying foreign food in the desert cause it always seems like the stuff is a day or two old, but the stuff looked fresh and tasted yummy.  The place was playing some Arabic music and had some Bollywood looking movie on the two plasma screens and although our waitress was from Venezuela, she played and sounded the Lebanese part pretty good.  She apologized for taking too long to bring out our bill, but I was having such a good convo with my friend that I told her 'no worries'.  I noticed that they do offer hookah and belly dancing on the weekends.  They have a little VIP nook inside and an average size patio outside.  You can sit down if you walk in the back door or order take-out from the front door.

+ + +'s:
fairly ethnic feel, fresh lunch food, clean, several areas to eat (inside, outside, VIP, take-out), friendly service

- - - 's:
faux materials (we all know it's fake, just paint it mediterranean blue or something), tone down on the clean smell

In sum, if you are looking for a bit of ethnic flair with decent food and a variety of seating choices, this is your place.  If you are looking for upscale mediterranean, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great food. Susan who manages Pita House even shares with me how she perfectly cooks the Basmati Rice. All the cooks are wonderful & gracioua."}
{"text":"We are BIG fans of Crazy Pita, but this place is better.  Better pita bread, chicken and beef were both good.  Basmati rice was nice.  Baba ganash best ever.  More food than we could eat.  Very friendly owner run, everything cook fresh.   We will be back - many times...."}
{"text":"Really good.... the hummus and baba is awesome. Will def revisit in the near future and will recommend to others."}
{"text":"Good food? Oh yes!

Amazing? Falls a bit short.

I ordered the vegetarian platter, so I could try a little of everything, which is usually my M.O. at new Med restaurants.  $10 seemed a little high, but it's Scottsdale, so I guess that's pretty normal.

It took quite a while to even get my glass of water, and longer for the food to come. There isn't really any indoor seating, but the patio is nice (if not a bit chilly at night. I assume it's a bit roasting in the summer).

The food itself? Good.  It didn't taste bad, or make me want to leave, but it wasn't mouth watering good.  So-so.

Will I be back? Probably. I do like Med food, and there aren't a ton of options near me. It's also cheaper than most places in Scottsdale.  Will I be craving it though? Not really."}
{"text":"Tabouli is my my main dish.  I love Mediterranean food.  Theirs is fresh and delicious.  The service is friendly, prompt and polite.  Seating is clean, plentiful and comfortable.  I have eaten many other dishes here and I have brought my family and friends.  All experiences have been very good.  The setting is casual.  It's easy to get your favorite spot (as I have.  LOL.)  
Please dine here if you like positive experiences."}
{"text":"Shittiest service ever, shitty food. Came just to relax and smoke hookah and then they decide to tell me that I have to order food with my hookah or get out. So this will be my last time here."}
{"text":"This is a great place if you were looking for a quick place for Mediterranean food. We ordered falafel wraps. They come with 2 sides - Salad and Rice or Fries. They were freshly made and delicious! It is about about $7 - $8 per wrap.. cant beat that. There were five of us and everyone's order was just perfect."}
{"text":"Family and I were looking for a place to have some hummus, shawarma, and falafel. When we arrived we were confused because there was nobody around to help us. We walked into the bar/ lounge area looking for someone for direction but quickly noticed this was a bar scene and not a scene for a 16 year old. Finally we found the patio area and we sat down at a table. There was a couple sitting a few tables away from us but no one on the staff acknowledged our presence. As I was looking for someone to help clean our table, I noticed there were a couple of teenage kids in the back corner of what looked like a kitchen, sitting down and looking at us. They never summoned anyone to help us nor did they offer to lend a hand to service us. Our table had a lot of dried bird droppings so we almost left but decided to tough it out. We ordered dinner but were never asked if we wanted anything to drink. Weird? I had to flag down a waiter who was passing by for some drinks. Just about that time 5 men decided to sit down at the table next to us and each one ordered a hookah. That made the experience even more distasteful because of the myriad of hookah scent smells mixing in with our dinner. We decided to hurry and eat and get the hell out of there. Then To make matters worse the waiter was clearing out each of the hookah chambers by blowing which spread the residual ashes into the air and of course onto our table. Let's just say the whole place seems to cater to smoking and NOT to a fine dining experience. We will not be back but thought I'd share the experience especially if someone wanted to eat in the patio area outside."}
{"text":"Came here on friday night with my friends. I have to admit that its the best place to hang out. Ordered hookah double apple and shawarma sandwich. Balanced flavors just like back home. Completely remodeled and classy looking. The DJ was amazing he got me dancing all night long. 
Now i can say there is an amazing middle-eastern place in scottsdale."}
{"text":"This place is very good and healthy which is always important. I come here very often and is always good. The staff is also great!!"}
{"text":"I wish if the ratings go to negative so I can express my experiences here, I kept giving Pita house many chances by coming in different days and timings. But the pattern never changes, beyond overpriced, the service is lousy, the food is either undercooked or filled with onions sticking out of it. I like onions don't get me wrong, but when I order a beef sandwich, I expect it be beef that has onions not the way around."}
{"text":"I loved the Pita House at first bite. When you taste all fresh food compared to processed, it's hard to go back. They make amazing Mediterranean and Lebanese food every day, from scratch, absolutely nothing canned. 

The atmosphere is new, simple, with a touch of elegance, as the floors are handmade tile and the counters marble and granite. The area is clean and well lit.
I love all their kabobs, especially the beef kabob platter. The hummus is extraordinary.

I am the founder and lead writer for Las Vegas Top Picks, which showcases great stuff around Vegas. I put Pita House on my website.  http://lasvegastoppicks.com/pita-house-mediterranean-grill/

I've known the owner, Charlie, for almost a year, from Roy's Liquor Store in Summerlin. I've heard many times about his passion for cooking, and remember when he was preparing the Pita House to open. He put a lot of love in every aspect--the design, the staff, the food, the oven, every little detail. Charlie told me he wanted to create a restaurant that on any given day, his family and friends from Lebanon could walk in and get fresh, authentic, delicious food.

From all that I've heard--and tasted--he's succeeded. I met the staff there too. They care about the food they create. This is not a day job for them, it's a livelihood and their life work. These are the kinds of restaurants I love.

The only drawback is I live on the other side of town, near Red Rock Casino. If I lived closer to Pita House, I would eat here at least three times a week, since it's so fresh and affordable.

Please give Pita House a try and let me know. Your taste buds will thank me!"}
{"text":"This used to be a fav but last few experiences both food and service have been terrible. Will miss this place after being a dedicated patron for 15 years."}
{"text":"Best hummus I've ever eaten . I come here at least once a week for the hummus and the steak kabobs are tender and juicy . The service is phenomenal. My favorite Mediterranean restaurant."}
{"text":"Let me preface the 3 stars by saying this is far from a bad review. Pita House is good, and the folks were friendly. But when you compare the expectations flavorwise they fell just a bit short.

The Shwarma, Kafta,Hummus, Salad, Pita, and Rice at our meal was enough to curb a Mediterranean craving. But when stacked up with local contemporaries of the hummus game, Pita House is certainly at home in the middle. 

Ive read great things about the Shwarma wrap, and sure enough the first bite was delicious. But I feel a lot of that was thanks to the garlic sauce, which like a secret weapon left the rest of the wrap vunerable in the taste department. 

I feel the best meals are those which you don't search for the salt and pepper, and here I found myself reaching for both. But regardless I'd still give the dishes of Pita House a solid B-."}
{"text":"The Food was good, but nothing to go brag about. I didn't know what to expect when I sat down and thought that the Hooka smoke would interfere with my eating, but it didn't. I was reading reviews and I understand why there are a bunch of negative comments about service. Our waitress was nice, but she never checked on us once after she brought us our food. I had to flag her down to get the check, which I felt was doing too much."}
{"text":"Solid food, reasonably priced hookah and a nice atmosphere. Staff is fine too. For some reason they refuse to serve tap water for free, which is illegal. I understand that they don't want to lose money giving out free water to customers who aren't buying much, but we spent $30 and still had to plead to get just one cup to split amongst three people. I'm not coming here again because I'm frankly tired of having to barter for something that I'm entitled to have as a paying customer. I'll be back if they change this absurd rule"}
{"text":"Verdict: Have you ever ate something so damn good that you were legit mad about being full? I just did, because I didn't want to stop eating!

I had ordered the Combo plate [1 skewer of chicken kabob, 1 skewer beef and 1 skewer lamb kabob, basmati rice, salad and their fresh, house-made pita bread that's to die for], and I already knew that this was going to be a lot of food, but I wanted to try all the meats--because protein. My girlfriend ordered the chicken wrap, which also came with basmati rice and salad.

The employees behind the counter were all friendly and extremely nice. They constantly checked up on us as we ate our lunch and I wasn't bothered by it at all. I forget the man's name that took our order [sorry!], but he was awesome and brought us out two different sauces to eat with our food. One was the traditional tzatziki sauce and the other was their garlic sauce. 

Now when the food came out and I opened the box; I was enamored with how the food looked, smelled and I couldn't wait to get it all in my belly! The meats were all perfectly seasoned and cooked until tender and juicy. The rice was light and fluffy and the salad had just the right amount of acidity that really complemented the whole meal. But what really got me was their in-house made pita bread--that's the stuff that was baked from the Gods. It had such a light and soft texture with the right amount of chewy-ness that made me feel like all other pita breads were inferior to this.

I ate in silence. 
I ate until I couldn't eat anymore. 
Then, I quickly realized I was upset that I was full.

It's a good thing there's always tomorrow.

Until next time: Eat on, Yelpers."}
{"text":"If I could have this weekly, I totally would. Never knew I would enjoy Greek food so much. Bf and I decide to check this place during dinnertime out on a whim. We dined in. Pita House looks like it's family owned and they were so sweet and friend. The lady kept checking up on us to make sure everything we ordered was to our satisfaction. 

We ordered pita bread and hummus to start. And then we each got an entrée of chicken/beef and lamb/kafta. Each entrée comes with rice pilaf, nicely seasoned and a side salad with this vinaigrette dressing. Entrée was big enough for leftovers. And as if it wasn't already delicious on the first day, leftovers were even better!!!!!!!! The seasoning and flavors soaked into the meat......mmmmmmm yesss!!!!!! I would definitely come back here again. And soon!"}
{"text":"Went here last night with friends. Not impressed one bit. Actually pretty sad about everything overall because middle eastern food is my heart. I have lived here all my life and I haven't been because I don't spend much time in the area. But it was late, in the area and I was hungry, so we're my friends. 

First off, the service is super slow. Not only that, we had to ask serval times for stuff we wanted like a beer and ketchup. We spent over $70 for almost nothing. This place is way over priced for what it is.

I got the chicken shawarma pita. First off Haji Baba is 100,000 times better than this and cheaper and I would rather go to Halal Guys over this place. Not a lot of chicken and here were pickles inside this and not the middle eastern pickles some small sliced nonsense. The only thing I liked were the fries. Although I asked for extra crispy and they were just hot. :/ sigh. We also ordered the tzatziki sauce app and gyro app. It was standard and nothing to really write about.

The hookah was decent. They have one of the best flavored tobaccos used, but honestly they killed it with too many coals and it became harsh pretty quick. They also charge $6 a person extra of the 2 max to smoke hookah. I mean come on. $6 for another piece of plastic on top of what we are already paying for...I'm good.

Honestly I won't be back for anything. The food was subpar to be nice. Not impressed at all from anything. Should have yelped this before with the low stars they have. Cheers to another one."}
{"text":"If anyone says this place is decent or good obviously has not had good pita sandwiches. The prices were ridiculous regardless of location, skimpy portions and seriously lacks in flavor. Had the Gyro and Falafel. Will never return."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Everything I have had here has been delicious. I usually get Lamb and Chicken Kabobs when I come . The Salad here is so good! This is a family owned place too. I personally like to support local business here. The owner is a very nice lady."}
{"text":"Great great great! Perfectly Authentic, you would get in Lebanon. I drive from Orange County Cali, to Vegas and first stop, PITA HOUSE!  Maniesh is a must must must. Babaganoush, the best you will find anywhere. Here is the key to your order, make sure you get a side of whipped garlic sauce that you dip the maniesh and the kebab or chicken. OMG absolutely the best! How about the price??!! You couldn't get this type of quality for this price and if you do, message me."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy yummy. I had tabbouleh and chicken/lamb kafta. The meat was juicy, spiced to perfection. The service was friendly and since it was my birthday I got some Baklava."}
{"text":"This place needs to get shut down...I have very low standards of food bc I think filibertos is decent...this place is complete joke. They take advantage of you charge you double the price....12 dollars for Costco water that's 25 cents a bottle or free. They tried to charge my group 3 times instead of twice...criminals...the bread is stale...the shishkabob? They call themselves middle easterners...smh they have no pride in where they came from. Close down! Already"}
{"text":"Great food always. Best hummus in town. Priced fairly.    Comfortable and fast but always fresh."}
{"text":"Unbelieveably slow was told ten minutes waited 19 minutes! Just be honest! Won't be back for sure"}
{"text":"Went there last night looking for a shisha but was disappointed with the service, slow coals, and frankly totally ridiculous belly dancer.

Music was blaring loud where we sat and varied between street Egyptian, Moroccan, and crappy Tunisian singers. 

There was only one server who came and fixed my shisha, after which it finally worked."}
{"text":"I was recommended by a friend 
And it was worth the drive
Fresh and yummy Hummos
Good portion of kebob 
Over all good value for money and good yummy meal ;)"}
{"text":"Having never tried this restaurant before and the one we usually go to closed, we decided to give it a try. We ordered the Greek Chicken Salad and let me tell you, it was pretty gross! The texture of the chicken was pasty and it reminded me of the gross, canned deviled ham meat. Once we put the dressing on it, it got gummy. Never again!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Middle Eastern food and have eaten at over a hundred restaurants easily. I rank this place middle of the road. Chicken Shawarma wrap is better than the beef wrap. Hummus is way below average I would avoid it. Tabbouli salad was also below bar. I am from Chicago area so many better choices there."}
{"text":"heres a tip directly from Gordon Ramsey himself....
if theres pictures of the food on the menu...RUN!!!
and thats what we should have done...beware people! the food is hands down terrible...the lettuce was wilted, the tomato's tasted like they were just about to sour if not already...my Gyro tasted like hamburger meat, my wires chicken had no taste at all...under seasoned and over cooked...
the Humus had way too much garlic, and tasted watered down...and there were sliced pickles in it!!!
expensive as well...$30 for a Gyro and a chicken kabob with a side of humus....
if you see this place, stay away...the hooka draws you in and the catchy name...but the food just docent live up to it....(bring a sick bag)"}
{"text":"Great food!  Kafta and Falafel are spot on and I have traveled in the middle east.  Food is great and the service is even better.  They have hookah too!"}
{"text":"DO NOT GO TO THIS RESTAURANT.  The owner is not honorable.  The owner advertises with restaurant.com.  However, upon presentation of the voucher, he refuses to honor.  Before going to restaurant, we confirmed the vouchers validity over the phone.  A better choice is Pita Jungle or Persian Room."}
{"text":"Great customer service! Nice place to chill! Its my first time here and i love it ! Great hookahs here ! Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Their house-made baba ganoush is to die for and I don't even like eggplant! Hidden greek spot in the silverado ranch area. The staff are very nice and personable too. If you want some good greek food and are in the area check them out! :) Only reason I gave 4 stars is because it's not my favorite greek place in my area, but very good quality non the less."}
{"text":"excellent food! I've come here at least a couple dozen times and the food never disappoints. actually I feel like it only gets better everytime! the owner and workers are very friendly and in general this is an excellent place to eat! I would recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"Awesome manakish. Tried the cheese, the zaatar and the lahm baajeen, all 3 kinds taste great. The owners are very friendly."}
{"text":"Small restaurant but really delicious middle eastern food.. we are pure vegetarians and really enjoyed their falafel wraps"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Mediterranean restaurant in the valley. The food is always fresh and they use the right amount of spices. If anyone know about Mediterranean food in Arizona, a lot of place over cook their meat and it tends to be dried out. But not here at pita house! It came out fresh and juicy everytime! MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"Had high hopes based on reviews. The service was quick and friendly. However, the chicken was SO dry, I had to drown it in sauce. The fries had a fishy taste to them, from the fryer grease not being fresh most likely.  Not sure if I will be back."}
{"text":"I found a DEAD fly in my salad coated in dressing. The server didn't charge me at least but oh my goodness. I will Not be returning"}
{"text":"Beware
Are used to go to this place about five years ago and the food food was great
Are there yesterday it was awful !
And got really really sick !!!
Filthy place now 
Yuck"}
{"text":"Painfully slow service.  When we arrived, there were only 2 other parties - both of whom were inside smoking.  So, we elected to go outside.  It took forever for our waitress to take our order but after she finally did, a few other parties trickled in.  We were there with our kids and intentionally sat away from anyone smoking but, within a short time, others came outside and started smoking so we were surrounded.  

We waited and waited for our food and watched while others who came in after us got their food.  At one point, the waitress apologised saying they had a huge party.  Not sure when the huge party got there but, they weren't there when we walked in.  

Finally got our appetizer - chicken with garlic and mushrooms.  Canned mushrooms.  Gross.  The chicken and sauce were good but seriously?  Canned mushrooms?  How much effort does it take to chop a few fresh mushrooms?

I had the gyro salad - it had iceberg lettuce, a couple tomato slices and a few cucumbers.  The gyro meat was good but, really?  iceberg lettuce?  Sigh....  It did come with tzatziki sauce but, I've had better.  This tasted like it came out of a bottle - definitely not freshly made. 

It was ok but, if you don't want to be inhaling smoke your entire meal, good luck....it seems as there is no place you can go to get away from it.  And the food is just ok.  Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Hookah was great and Gyro that I had was good but not a place that I would go to again in the near future.
Waitress sucked
She was pretty stuck up on the bottled water only on the weekends AND you get CHARGED for it!
Table near us complained NUMEROUS times over less than desirable service.
Sparing any Fries/Ranch lovers because they have NO RANCH!"}
{"text":"Midnight on a Friday night and this place was slammed. Might have been overflow from the nearby bars because it was wall-to-wall crowds at the inside register and on the patio wrapping around towards the back. My first impression formed based on the number of patrons who appeared middle eastern. The group sitting on patio to our left were speaking Greek. So, perhaps the food and the hookah reflected the same authenticity?

The food was OK. We split the regular hummus that came with assorted pita bread and veggies. It tasted average store-bought. Though it didn't knock our socks off, hummus is a wonderful (healthier) alternative to your standard late night drunken, fourth-meal, Scottsdale snack. My friend ordered a regular gyro and fries. It looked pretty good and the fries were also average tasting.

We ordered the blue mist hookah flavor and a round of Coors Light. The beers came in bottles - I think draft would be a nice touch. The hookah flavor was great and had a solid kick. I was impressed by how long it lasted between 3 people. We noticed the hookah lacked a good clearing mechanism, so the smoke turned stale towards the end. The hoses had a fancy looking mouthpiece to them that we all enjoyed.

Overall, I recommend Pita House as a hookah patio. There aren't many in the area, especially ones within decent walking distance to bars and restaurants. I've heard Oasis is good too. If you're looking for Greek or Mediterranean food, it's not top notch, but it may be one of few options nearby. It's a great fall-back and easy-to-spot location when you need it."}
{"text":"Service was terrible. Got back the wrong change. $3 for a water bottle and they didn't even let us know until the end after we drank it. Everyone else had free water? Not coming back"}
{"text":"This place is very laid back and relaxed. The food literally tasted so fresh and amazing. They cook your food to order. They put some love into it and you can tell. I ordered the beef kabob plate and my boo got the lamb and beef krafta. They both came with rice and a salad. More than enough food. I ate everything lol it was so good and juicy and wet. Just made my mouth and tummy feel all kinds of ways. 

The service is very friendly. You basically order your food at the register and pay for it, then they bring it to you at the table. We'll definitely be coming back here again. Thankyou !!"}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite Mediterranean place. The food is consistently superlative, as well as the service. Their prices beat every other Mediterranean place in town. I highly recommend this establishment, and I cannot say enough."}
{"text":"Well for anyone who has been seriously needing just 1 authentic, high quality, ethnic place to make your GO TO spot this is it. Just got the Chicken Shawarma wrap and it is amazing. For garlic obsessors like me the garlic sauce is amazing. Just perfect. The nice lady at the front was so friendly and you can tell the owner really cares. 6 stars. We have to support this place NOW"}
{"text":"Heaven is a pillow of pita bread and hummus that goes up to my knees! 

There's an alarming amount of the Greek food places in Vegas and the surrounding neighborhoods, they almost rival the amount of asian focused restaurants in the Valley. The Pita House for me is currently the heavy hitter on the Henderson Greek food circuit. First off they make everything in house which includes, the breads, hummus, and all the sauces. 

I found The Pita House on Yelp, skimmed a few reviews and decided to stop in for some mediterranean meats on a spit. I went with the Beef Shawarma Wrap meal with a side of hummus and pita bread. This lunch item hit all the right spots, the beef was tender and juicy, plus the veggies inside were lightly dressed and super fresh! This meal also came with a side salad and fries, what?!

The hummus was ridiculously fresh, like they had almost made it to order. This creamy dream bowl was partnered with the softest pita bread I think I've ever had, a definite must order when visiting the Pita house. This place will do you right and help to curb that big fat greek craving."}
{"text":"Pita House is one of my favorite places to get Mediterranean food. 

My boyfriend always gets the gryo wrap and I always go for the falafel wrap. Both come with the option of fries or rice and salad. You can't go wrong. The rice is always fluffy and the fries are always perfectly crisp. The salad has a nice dressing I always crave.  

With the sides, the portions are very filling, but I love the appetizers and desserts as well. The za'atar on flatbread is so good, and is even better with the veggies. The baklava is also one of my favorites in town. Some places make it way too sweet, but these are excellent and make my mouth water just writing about them. 

Staff is friendly, prices are fair, and I couldn't ask for much more. They even cut the price a bit if you pay with cash."}
{"text":"I'm so happy I found this place. I used to live in LA and loved Zankou Chicken. Mmm yum! Since moving here two years ago I haven't found a reliable authentic shawerma place. I've had their chicken shawerma wrap with basmati rice and salad and it was awesome. Lots of tender chicken, fresh ingredients, fluffy pita and just a lot of care in making a good product at a reasonable price. I got two meals out of it. The next day I came back and got the lamb kafta which was also flavorful (but I prefer the chicken shawerma). I'll keep coming back. The interior, decor, friendly service are all exactly what I want from my go-to shawerma place. Awesome hidden gem in a Henderson strip mall!"}
{"text":"I absolutely refuse to go to a place that does not provide free tap water. Over the years I have spent hundreds of dollars at Pita House on hookah, food, and beverages. It is absolutely absurd to think you can get away with not offering free tap water to paying customer in the desert. It's just really petty and stupid. I will never come back. Hope losing customers is worth the $.01 cents a glass they save on the tap . . . great business sense. Meanwhile, Hula's next door offers excellent customer service. Go there instead."}
{"text":"Finally found a Mediterranean restaurant with great falafel! They were a golden inside, not green like many other places.  Baba Ganoush was wonderful too.  Other items look good too, prices are decent, will be going back often!"}
{"text":"I can't honestly review the food. Establishment was clean and inviting. However, being vegetarian/pescatarian there was not much on the menu to accommodate. The only protein choices are beef, chicken and lamb. Crazy pita offers shrimp."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch one day it loved it.  It was a great location in old town Scottsdale.  The food came out in average time and was delicious.  I especially loved the dessert we got.  

The restaurant seemed a bit older however it is a classic Greek restaurant with lots of character and beautiful artistic work.

Nothing fancy. But a great casual spot to stop for lunch in Old Town."}
{"text":"Food was fresh and the staff is very nice.
The best I have had.  The hummus was great the Babaganoush was okay.  The meat dishes and rice were also great !!
Def my spot for Greek food!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious! They make everything fresh and flavorful. Very authentic Lebanese style cuisine! So happy I found this place! The zaatar pitas are my favorite!"}
{"text":"Whenever I need my Mediterranean fix this is my go to spot in the area! Food is always made fresh, has yet to disappoint. Love the owner, she cares about her business, you can tell in the quality of the food and her service!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!  Me and my sister go here all the time :) the Greek salad is amazing! The dressing is so delicious I wish they would sell it in bottles.  Their hummus yummy!!!  Everything had so much flavor! A must try!!!"}
{"text":"Pita House is a good spot to chill @ either before going out or to hang out late night for food/hookah.

Both of the times I have been here the staff has been consistently good service-wise.  I have tried several food items and it's fairly good as well.  I do have other spots that I would go to if I was purely interested in just eating.  

Pita House is pretty neat because they offer food, adult beverages, a dance/lounge area, and hookah .... Plus the people that come here are way more chill than you would find @ Oasis.  Additionally, if you come here late night there most likely won't be a crazy long wait to get food/hookah.

I believe certain nights they may even still have belly dancers dancing around the venue, which was pretty cool to see since I've never seen that before.

The prices here are fairly reasonable for old town scottsdale, and as I mentioned above I like it here better than its closest competitor up the street Oasis.   There is nothing exceptional or amazing here, but it gets the job done if you want to eat, drink, and hookah.  I would absolutely recommend Pita House to others."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere if you're looking for a little change from normal bar or club scene. Food is good and reasonable. Large outdoor patio is a great environment for people of all ages. The hookahs are great too. We had one that lasted over two hours and they kept the coals burning. Service was good and they made sure to keep the hookah coals turning over. The music can get a little loud inside and depending on what the feel of the night is it can be annoying if you are trying to hang out with friends on the patio and techno is blasting overhead."}
{"text":"Delicious and authentic! Love the Zaatar and kabobs. Delicious basmati rice. Good price and great food. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Super good! And kinda hidden around bigger named places so I would assume it gets missed by alot of people.
their house dressing that they put on their salad is SO DELISH! I wish they sold it in bottles!
I sat at the bar, on a weekday afternoon, on another one of my solo lunch adventures. I got a cocktail and it was made perfectly- a little strong, which is totally they way I like it."}
{"text":"There pita bread is amazing and hummus is the best I ever had. They had a really nice meat on rotisserie selection.  The couple that owns it is very nice great service!"}
{"text":"I've never gotten something I didn't like here. I recently moved to New Orleans and when I'm in town this is a MUST stop by. The hummus is out of this world, and I don't typically like hummus. Falafel, chicken, beef, rice. It's all so good. Go go go!"}
{"text":"The beef kabob was fantastic -- moist and flavorful. The gyro was okay. The rice was tasty.
Next time, I would skip the gyro and go for something else from the menu, but the beef kabob will be a go to dish!"}
{"text":"I should probably rate this place 3.5 stars.

Been here like tonnes of times. Totally love to do hookah in the open space. Many hookah Flavors to choose from. 
Double apple and blue mist are the best so far. Almazo (Lebanon beer) is unique and must try. 

Restrooms are lil untidy and apart from that..its a nice place to hangout."}
{"text":"Great food and service...delicious, clean, healthy, quality food! They also have a nice, private outdoor patio so we were able to bring our dog along too!"}
{"text":"Loved it. 

Not a typical 4 star experience, because it's no frills and divey with very little ambiance. But I came here for lunch with friends and it just hit the spot. 

I'll be back."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I keep coming back. Their hummus and pita bread can't be beat. Sometimes I just stop by to pick that up...way better than store bought. 

The gyro sandwich is great...and huge! I can only eat half. It also comes with rice or fries and a mini Greek salad. The staff is always super friendly. This is a great family owed place and I will definitely keep returning! Come check it out!"}
{"text":"This was not good at all. Ordered the gyro plate. Meat was prefab all pressed into the same size and shape. Pita bread was thin and gyro only came with onions, of which I don't eat. So I had pita bread with pressed meat and some tzatziki. Never had a gyro without tomatoes before. The server was very nice though. Gave me some iced tea in a to-go cup. Though he never checked back on me after dropping off my food until I was already done. I also substituted hummus for a salad. I'm sure the hummus was much smaller than the salad but still cost $1.50 more. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Had the turkey kafta, never have seen that on a menu before. It had delicious flavor. The salad that came with it was great as well. The pita bread was fresh, thin, and the best I've had in a long time. The hummus was also extremely tasty. We will certainly be back. Great spot and worth the visit."}
{"text":"This place needs a new name... how about AWESOME HOUSE?? The Pita House delivers so much more than just food. 

While visiting Scottsdale, we wanted to pay homage to our ancestry and smoke some hookah. After dinner at RA sushi, we ended up walking over for what we thought would be an hour smoke sesh before heading to the W to party. We were there for 5 hours! The vibe was awesome... yes, they serve food, but the hookah patio is where its at. They've got lights for ambiance, misters out of necessity, and music blaring and a belly dancer for entertainment. 

We ended up going back the next night to try the food and continue to smoke our lungs into oblivion. Yeah, you read that right... 2 nights in a row. Did I mention we were only in Scottsdale for 2 nights? And we specifically stayed at the W with intentions of partying our asses off. 

What we ordered: 
Both nights: Chocolate + Mint Hookah... HANDS DOWN the best flavor hookah I've ever smoked!! Tasted like Mint Chocolate chip ice cream. Hells yes. 

Mixed Fruit: Good flavor... very smooth, but a hint of menthol at the end. 

Blueberry + Mixed Melon: Yes! God yes! Tasted like bubble gum. 

Vegetarian Appetizer plate: Babaganouj was outstanding. The bread was warm and fresh. 

Falafel sandwich: YUM! The falafel was light and not fried to Sh*t. Mmm, it was good. This was heaven in a pita. 

The people made this place! We pretty much made BFF's with the staff and owner. They took SUCH good care of us. We had fresh coals every 5 minutes - that's attentive! 

I thought Scottsdale was alright. Worth a repeat visit? Probably not. Then I found this place. I'll be back just for the Pita house!"}
{"text":"I had a Mediterranean food craving for lunch so decided to try this place on a whim. I did the gyro and fries and I feel like they could have been done better. The set-up here is a bit awkward, too. I think there is a hookah bar on the side, but there was no signage or help telling me about the place. Food was not up to my standards. If they made there own fries or had something a bit more unique it would have been much better. The people were very nice."}
{"text":"I love this place,  I highly recommend the cheesy bread. The lady that runs the place is old school.  Don't let her impatience detour you.  You will love the food!  Bed side manner... ehh."}
{"text":"hungry at the bars and this place was open around midnight. we sat outside, ordered from a waitress who had the personality of a tin can. forgot 2 of our dishes when our food arrived. i'm sure it would have tasted better if it weren't for the wretched hookah smoke. it didn't seem that bad when we walked onto the patio. 
but after our food came out, a large crowd of young men sat at the table next to us, ordered 2 hookah's and yech.....we let the food stay on the table. the sweet smokey smell of hookah obliterated any hunger we had. 
maybe that's why their take out is so popular."}
{"text":"So unsatisfied the meat was so under cooked and the service was not good, my food was cold and the hummus dry.  It's never good when you leave a restaurant still hungry.  The rice was not fresh &  I was  so thirsty because my waitress forgot about me.  Overall 2 thumbs down"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I had the chicken shawarma,  yellow rice, and salad. And from reading the reviews I just had to try the pita bread and hummus! No regrets whatsoever. The food is so fresh, and has great flavor. I could eat this everyday."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. We waited almost an hour!! She avoided eye contact the whole time. We were not in a hidden spot! After almost an hour, she walked up to us and asked if we had gotten our food. Um, no, we had an empty table!! We assumed she was busy, but obviously she didn't enter the order. It was very upsetting. My daughters and I weren't smoking hooka, maybe that's why she gave more attention to the men that were. It's too bad. This place was really good at one point. Sad to see it in the gutter."}
{"text":"I am a regular here. I love Greek food and this is close to my business. I dine in for lunch and order out for dinner. I order the chicken shawarma pita every time. I love their side salad dressing and tzatziki. If their falafel was better and portions were bigger I would give them 5 stars."}
{"text":"Rubbery chicken (undercooked?) I couldn't eat.  Tzasiki sauce was just ok, not creamy and tangy the way I prefer.  I don't think I will be back.  Yanni's across the street is a better choice."}
{"text":"This was literally the worst experience I've ever had. I sat down and after ten minutes no one came to me so I went inside just to get a menu. Five to seven minutes pass and no one comes by to bring me water. It's AZ in the summer time.  So it's now been 15 min I walk in just to order instead of ordering at my table and while I'm there I ask for water. We waited for another 11 min with no water. Half the Food comes. No water. They bring the rest out no water. Finally a couple minutes later we get freaking water. After that no one came to check up on us even when we needed the bill there was no one and I had to go inside again to ask for my bill and ended up paying at the host stand. Do not come here it's awful"}
{"text":"Ordered chicken kabob the server came with beef. When asked for more sauce she never came back with any passed by our table 10 times with nothing. Ordered a orange mint hookah they gave us a burnt out blue mist and when confronted about it all they said was \"we can charge you have price for a new one\" never again will I go to this place. Lesson learned"}
{"text":"This is an easy place to hang out and meet others over a hookah and drinks. The food is fine, fine. My falafel was mostly oily crisp and the babaganoush was thin and not flavorful. The service was good and our meals came quickly. I just don't eat middle eastern that often, so when I do I want it to taste better...and I don't like the hookah experience. If the food were delicious, the hookahs wouldn't have mattered."}
{"text":"Absolute worst service I have ever experienced. They even tell you they don't serve tap water so that they can charge for bottled water. They are rude and inattentive. I  would never come back. Wish i could give less than 1 star."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for lunch and I've never been disappointed. I got a great Gyro and a drink for $6 in Oldtown. $6 in Oldtown for lunch with a quality meal, it's almost unheard of."}
{"text":"The food was fine. My issue is with the bill. I paid with a card and put a cash tip in the jar. When the bill settled with my bank, Pita House added another dollar for themselves. Check your posted transactions."}
{"text":"Wonderful please friendly lady behind the counter!
I will recommend to anyone who will have a nice delicious lunch or dinner! Super Duper five star ! thanks for reading:))"}
{"text":"The reviews here did not steer us wrong. Great food, great atmosphere, and friendly staff!

We had the beef kabob and beef swarma, both were excellent!"}
{"text":"Very freshly baked lahm bajun and Manaeesh ! Delicious & authentic Lebanese grill 
Highly recommended if you are in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Quality of food was so-so and service was slow. One tiny kitchen to service all to-go orders and tables. Not a great experience."}
{"text":"At pita house you are going to get some well made Greek/Mediterranean food. It's not going to be GREAT, but it will be better than that chain store across the street whose name shall not be mentioned. 

I was slightly alarmed at the mispronounciation of \"gyro\" ( read: euro) , but luckily it was good enough to offset that. 

What you will get at pita house is service that cares about you and really values your business. .. Which is hard to come by. That is what will send me back... and based on my authentic cultural Greek experience of watching \"my big fat Greek wedding\" a couple years ago,  That's what's truly authentic about this place. 

Sayonara pita pit.... oops. I guess I will mention it."}
{"text":"I'm only giving this place 4/5 stars only because they need more workers. Overall food was bomb and I love the DJ that comes at night. I don't understand how people are giving such low ratings when this place gets very very busy almost every time I go there. The hookah is excellent to me and the food was great. Overall employees do try there best to reach your table but I would advice they find more employees ."}
{"text":"Great place to go for Lebanese food!! Very casual restaurant but the food is amazing! Try the fresh tabouleh you won't regret a visit here. Great for big parties and very clean food. Good for a quick snack or for a large meal"}
{"text":"I've been on a roll with trying new Greek/Mediterranean food places because for some reason I am always craving it. 

This place was reaaaally good. It's a little hidden, but a good find. I had the falafel wrap with rice. Out of all the Greek places I've been they probably had the best tasting falafel. It was fried to perfection and was still soft and flavorful, not over fried and hard. The only thing I didn't like in my wrap was that they put a lot of parsley, but that's a preference. Next time I know to order without it bc they used too much for my taste.

I was also able to try their hummus and chicken. The hummus was so good and the chicken kebab was so juicy! They also have a selection of Louisiana hot sauces out. I thought the garlic hot sauce was actually good with the Greek food. I'm 

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Just finished lunch from here.

upon entering, the place is well kept and clean. Very nice. TV in the corner, playing some woman talk show (Probably killed a few of my weaker brain cells being forced to listen to the show). friendly young man taking orders.. all looked good.

I ordered a beef shawarma plate that came with rice and salad and a chicken kabob plate.  Then the wait began. On one hand, it was fine because I could tell they were making my plates from scratch, somewhat. I was the only person in the place and it took about 15 minutes to get the 2 plates. I was ok with that... except for being forced to listening to a bunch of girls talking on the tv...

Went home and opened the containers.  First off, they got my chicken order wrong. Instead of kabobs they gave me a straight chicken plate. Didn't bother me too much, but I wanted some vegs. First the beed shawarma:  very dry and it looked like older meat. Because, shawarma cooks similar to Al Pastor but in a cone type de\vice. Since all my meat looked like end cuts, I am guessing it was a piece of beef cooking for a while causing the burnt ends. I didn't mind but too dry.  The salad and rice were excellent.  The big negative was salt. way too salty.

Then tried the chicken plate that was supposed to be kabobs.  Excellent except for the same complaint of the beef, extremely salty.  What too salty, I'm still tasting it.

Price was comfortable with $18.35 for 2 plates.... but couldn't eat all of it due to the large portions and the salt...  I saved the rest for a late n right snack... maybe having the munchies with a beer I won't mind the salt so much.

Overall, A-OK place. I will try other places in the area that also serve pitas... if I can't find anything I really like, I might come back here."}
{"text":"I went to Pita House with a friend for lunch a few weeks ago.  The place is a bit small but really clean and the cashier, was the owner I believed.  She was very kind, and walked us through the menu, we got the meat pies, the chicken shawarmas.  Everything was really good.  The combo came with Fries and a salad.  The dressing on the salad was amazing, and the fries were crispy.  The main star was the shawarma.  It was absolutely flavorful and solid.  I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Seeing Chris R's review for Pita House reminded me to review my experience too.  I stopped in for what I thought would be a quick carry-out order late afternoon / early evening on a Saturday... 

I skimmed the menu that was posted outside and walked in.  I recall hearing positive things about this place and figured it would be perfect for what I was looking for - a quick and somewhat healthy option to take home and eat quickly as I got ready for my night out.  Was that the case?  Yes and no.

I was not sure which side to go in to order from... when I walked in, the one lady working there acknowledged me but didn't return to take my order for a good ten minutes.  Just as I was getting ready to leave, she apologized, but I was getting antsy and annoyed.  I placed my order and told her I'd wait for it... A greek salad and a vegetarian appetizer plate.

Neither the salad or the app plate was the best I've had.  They were both fine.  I liked the combo of tabbouleh, hummus, baba ghanoush, grape leaves, and falafel... and luckily Jared helped me to eat it all as it was a lot of food.  It was more than $20 once I added a bottle of water though.  More expensive than I would've guessed.

Will I rush back?  Probably not?  Will I return?  Possibly... not a bad option for Middle Eastern cuisine - and perhaps it's better if you eat in on a night when they have belly dancers or something?!  I'll update if and when I experience that."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on Friday. Wanted to try their hummus because many reviews here said their hummus taste so fresh like it's made to order. I love hummus so I had to come try their hummus.
Yes, the hummus tasted so fresh and delicious. So much better than my usual Trader Joe's Mediterranean Hummus. It came with their home made pita bread. Amazing.
I ordered 2 Skewers Lamb Kabob. For some reason, there were two different kinds of lamb chunks in the dish. The ones that were so tender almost like ground lamb meat ball and the ones that were very tough and chewy. The tender ones were so juicy and delicious, but the tough ones I didn't enjoy. It tasted like just plain lamb meat with no flavor. I left the tough hard lamb meat to go and gave to my dogs. They really enjoyed it so I'm happy. (There was no spice or salt on the meat. Just plain so it's OK.)
Make sure you ask for the garlic sauce. Their garlic sauce is delicious and goes with any kind of meat (chicken, beef, lamb and even vegetable) They don't give you unless you ask for it. 
The older guy that was working here was very attentive. He said he came from Boston to help his friend's restaurant. How nice.
I'll come back to get their fresh delicious hummus but I will not order their lamb again."}
{"text":"I ordered my food to-go. This place is a little over priced but pretty decent. I ordered the chicken salad along with an order of hummus. The hummus was pretty good and came with a generous side of pita bread but the bread seemed stale. The salad was pretty good but the chicken was too salty for my taste. I was a little grossed out that as I stood waiting for my food the guy preparing it used his bare hands (which he didn't wash ahead of time), to add items to my salad."}
{"text":"We were super excited to try to this place because our of affinity for Middle Eastern/Mediterranean food. 

-We walked in and there were flies coming out of the kitchen (Health Code?)
-There was only one person working. This one person greeted the guests, took the orders, AND went to the back to make the food orders. He additionally had two tables sitting outside that he had to wait in addition to the walk-ins. 
-We ordered two chicken salads and two side dips, and it ended up being nearly $40. This is Pita House, not the Persian Room. The 'Greek Salad' was essentially a simple bed of lettuce with 1 Chicken Kabob. The Kabob of chicken was $5 plus an upcharge of $1 for making it kabob. You do not have an option to make it non-kabob. As you can see, the $14 salad is as big as its receipt.  
-The prices listed on the menu \"vary\". 
-Dirty

I love Middle Eastern food and don't know how this place is still in business. The only good thing about this place was the extremely kind and hardworking server who was attending to all of the guests."}
{"text":"This small shop is great for vegans and meat eaters alike. On top of that, they use no preservatives, no can openers, and there is no microwave on site. Food was delicious! Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Had the chicken kabob plate and it was surprisingly delicious.  Great char and taste on the chicken, pita was great, and the rice was really really good too!  Came back and had dinner there the same day!"}
{"text":"Smokey environment, holes on the seats, rocking tables, dirty tables, and paint falling off the walls, and gum under the table. The menus are falling apart and the pictures on the menu look better than what is served. For example the menu show tomatoes on the salad. The salad was only lettuce and vinaigrette with a fly. They have the greasiest rice, but a great garlic sauce."}
{"text":"Size matters... If you are going to sell the smallest gyro, it better be amazing. Unfortunately, not only are these the SMALLEST gyros we have ever had, they are the worst too.  These gyros had maybe 2 thin and skinny slices of meat on them but where they lacked meat, they over compensated with an insane amount of sauce. 

The salads that accompanied the sandwiches was nothing more than dried out, wilted lettuce with a white tomato sliver. 

If this wasn't an Old Town tourist trap location that offered a full bar, hookah bar and late night service, odds are they would have gone out of business a long time ago. Don't expect any shade on their patio, as they have 1 functioning umbrella and 1 non-functioning umbrella. 

The good news is we now know where not to go for good, authentic Middle Eastern cuisine. 

They have a very convenient location, situated right off Scottsdale Rd directly next door to Pattie's."}
{"text":"This restaurant is the best restaurant in town,hands down, the food is excellent, everything is fresh and homemade. I highly recommend it to anyone who's a foodie. I've tried everything on the menu at least once,haven't been disappointed yet, go check them out.Bon apetit."}
{"text":"I think they have the best vegetarian platter as far as Mediterranean platters go. I ordered the vegetarian platters from other Mediterranean places in that area & they weren't as good as Pita House & also not as friendly either. I placed an order for pick up. When I called to order, I made sure they didn't use eggs or dairy since I don't need that in my life on their sauces etc. & the lady on the phone said they didn't. When I came in, she was so nice & friendly. 

The salad was ordinary, nothing to exclaim about but the baba ghanoush, falafel & tahini sauce tasted amazing! Tasted perfect! I'm always craving their food now. I wanted to try out other similar restaurants with vegan selections & it doesn't even compare to Pita House."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is so good, fresh and pita bread delicious! Friendly service also!"}
{"text":"This place can't be beat for real fresh delicious Mediterranean food. They don't have microwaves or can openers in this place... It's all made from fresh ingredients. Salads, pita, shawarma kabobs... They're all fantastic! You can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"A good option for lunch. Cheap, good flavours,excelent location and fast service. I love their bastami rice!"}
{"text":"Very good food. Everything is made there. I would recommend getting the gyro wrap or the chicken kabob. The food had great flavor and they have extremely good service."}
{"text":"Food is Terrible!!!!! Absolutely awful ..I told an employee the food was really bad and he  said: \"I just work here bro\" and walked off. The first time I tried it I thought it might've just been a fluke second time it was completely empty food still came out lukewarm greasy and disgusting BAD CHOICE!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Good food. All made fresh, everything \"homemade\"! Service friendly and prompt. Clean and comfortable. 
Mostly meat based, but they have some vegetarian and can make other vegi combo requests not on menu. Just wish they could have fish added to menu."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this place after reading the reviews. Sadly tho my excitement turned to disappointment. Our appetizers came after the meal, the service was slow. And was kinda pricey for food served in styrofoam. Bad and expensive experience."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch, and prices were pretty decent.  The hummus appetizer was plenty to share among the 3 of us.  On top of that, the chicken gyro pita was huge! Plenty of chicken pieces, drenched with tazatziki sauce.  With a side of salad, you can easily fill up for lunch and be good for the entire day. 

Plenty of seating inside.  I would have opted to sit outside, but the heat was blazing by the late afternoon."}
{"text":"Staff was incredibly nice and polite... but... I specifically came here because Yelp said they cater to vegans. In fact, in the categories all it says is \"vegan, Mediterranean\". I'm not sure if it's an issue with the restaurant, or yelp itself... but When I got there, menu had tons of meat options and no mention of vegan whatsoever. As per the usual have to ask a million questions to make sue I can eat the vegetarian plate. Small tip to the restaurant, if you do serve vegan PLEAESE make it well known on the menu! Or update Yelp to not show you as being a vegan restaurant. Many folks will thank you!"}
{"text":"This place had the best customer service! I'm visiting from out of town and I absolutely loved the gyro here. I definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"This is some of the most amazing Mediterranean cuisine I've ever had! (And I come from an Arab family.) Everything tastes so homemade. The hummus had amazing texture and flavor. We ordered beef kafta and a wrap, which were both out of this world. Highly recommend this place. They make you feel like you're part of the family!"}
{"text":"Another find via Groupon, we visited this place a handful of times.  Located in Old Town Scottsdale, just off Scottsdale Rd, we tried a variety of menu items here:

Hummus, $5.99
Gyro Classic Plate, $12.99

Vegetarian Combo (Falafel, Hummus, Tabbouleh, Babaghanouj, Grape Leaves, Tomatoes, Pickles, Olive Oil), $9.99
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pita-house-scottsdale?select=g-Fgs-_PKrXi8J6gg3Umng#g-Fgs-_PKrXi8J6gg3Umng

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pita-house-scottsdale?select=tkKfkXsMaPJsb1Dn77sZ1g#tkKfkXsMaPJsb1Dn77sZ1g

The first time we visited, I got the Gyro Classic Plate, which is basically all of the ingredients in a Gyro Sandwich, but on a plate which makes it a larger portion.  It was a bit too much for me, so on subsequent visits, I ordered the Gyro Classic Sandwich.  The Gyros are ok, not great.

My favorite menu item here is the Vegetarian Combo.  It has all of my favorites on it.....Falafel, Hummus, Tabbouleh, yum!  However, I've had better in my life, which is why I'm only giving this joint 3 stars.

The service is so/so here.  One evening, we had awesome service....on a couple other visits, it wasn't very good.  I thank Groupon for introducing me to a new restaurant, but it isn't on my all time list.

Return Factor - 50%"}
{"text":"I was expecting so much more here on my first visit after reading other reviews. Service was friendly & I'll first say I enjoyed the hummus & baba ganoush more than anything we ordered. Both were worth a trip back to pick them up anytime. The salad with chicken was a huge disappointment, we figured it would be grilled chicken breast seasoned with Mediterranean spices. Instead the salad was dressed in a vinegar based salad dressing we found a bit boring and the onion was not red nor fresh and crispy but a big droopy raw yellow ring of onion. The chicken was mostly dark meat and tasteless. The chicken shawarma was in a wrap with a sauce, lettuce & tomato. Soggy and tasteless best describes. Just not nearly as seasoned as we're accustomed to nor was the dark meat ungrilled chicken appetizing."}
{"text":"Wow, just wow. I'm from the Napa valley so I'm very critical of food, rarely give 5 stars but this place is remarkable! I'm not Lebanese but this place seems legit! If I had to describe in 2 words it would be; fresh and satisfying. Also the customer service is great and the price is on point. YAY!"}
{"text":"Horrible service!!!
I was visiting from LA and we hav tons of hookah places. Since the moment we sat down they gave us a huge attitude. After seating us it took them over 10minutes to even akcnowledge us. They had only 4 other tables so not busy at all and the waiter visited them several times before he even responded to me flaging him down. I asked him for any hoolah he would like to bring us. 10min later the hookah arrived but we had to wait another 5 mins to get charcol. They put this tiny charcols which went out in a few minutes. I actuallt had to get up and go to ask for more. Then i asked the waiter is he can give me a menu to order some food and something to drink. He said ohh the kitchen is closed. I said well can I atleast get a drink? He said sure and got me a beer.  The interesting part was that they continued serving the other tablea with food atleast 30minutes after i asked him. 
Service is the key in these kind of business. I guess that is acceptable in Arizona but this place would not survive one day in LA. 
Poor management..."}
{"text":"Out here from California on business and boy must I say I have found my GO-TO spot for my Mediterranean cravings. Being from middle eastern lineage, I appreciate when a restaurant knows what they're doing. This place had outstanding food, and the service was more than fantastic! We had the shawarma, falafel, hummus, spinach pie (sabanekh) and Zataar. We ordered tons of food thinking it wasn't going to be enough, and we couldn't even finish half of it! Thanks to Suzanne for having a great vibe for us! I will definitely be returning back every time I'm in the area to show support to this wonderful establishment!!"}
{"text":"Strong gyro meat and salad. I didn't rally like the styro foam cups and the plastic silverware. Good quick place to eat. Not life changing"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night in Summer for a quick bite.  Seating is only available outside, and chairs are very uncomfortable for extended sitting - which is ironic considering the Pita House is also a Hookah Joint.  The place has a very hip vibe, which the downtempo and house beats create through Pita's sound system.

Misters keep the patio cool, but soaked.  

Service was fast and friendly, even our host (or manager?) stopped by the table to see how we were enjoying the food.  

Food is typical Mediterranean/Middle Eastern kafta, gyros, greek salads, and baba ghanoush.  Sampled three different meat dishes including kafta kebabs, chicken skewers, and beef skewers.  All were very dry and overcooked - flavors were there, however.

Overall, I think this is a good place for late night eats - meeting the gang for some Hookah before heading out to the clubs, but certainly not for a comfortable and delectable dining experience."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and friendly service.  Gyro was amazing and the schwarma wrap was to die for! We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"What a joke of a buisness. Clearly my friends and I are not the only ones who got scammed with the 3dollar water. I hope it's worth it to the server to lose a tip over this. We were horrified with not getting free tap water... my boyfriend tried to talk to management and they were just jerks. Awful. Too bad because food was good."}
{"text":"Really terrific food, great variety, and friendly service!  Had Hummus apps, falafel pita sandwich, and some yummy rice on side..... highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I've had better and I've had worse! It's a good place for a quick bite but nothing to write home about to your Greek family members! Whatever you do.......DON'T TRY THE BAKLAVA! Driest thing besides the Mojave desert! One look at it and you'll instantly know what I'm talking about.....unless you've never had it...and you still would hate it!"}
{"text":"Ordered the falafel with toppings on UberEats. 
All that came was falafel in the shape of mozzarella sticks, pita bread, and a side of tahini sauce. Falafel tasted as if t were left in the microwave too long."}
{"text":"The best falafel in town. Super clean and the nicest people ever. Im craving this place right now! So amazing"}
{"text":"I've been here maybe five or six times. Every time I come here the service is really bad. I'll come with friends for food and hookah. The waitresses don't check on water or drinks or to see if you want more. The hookah service is a little better, but not by much. I like the food for the most part and there are decent amount of the vegetarian options, but overall this is my least favorite hookah bar."}
{"text":"1st time there and ordered the falafel wrap and beef shawarma.  The beef was crispy and dry and had an off taste, like maybe they used beef from before the holiday weekend.  The falafel was extremely biter but was the only thing stomachable next to the fries. The kicker is when I told the girl behind the counter she told me she would take a note of it and hope I have a better experience next time.  I only took one bite.  Next time, yeah right."}
{"text":"After coming here for quite a while probably a year and a half or so. This place always exceeds expectations. I usually get the same thing, but every time I get it it is always prepared fresh and absolutely delicious. The lady who works at the front is always so sweet. I love this place for not only the food and the service but the comfort and homie feel to the vibe. I absolutely love it"}
{"text":"Walked in and ordered lunch; falafel pita and a side of rice. Would hope it would only take 10 min (since I was the only one there), but it took 20 min (minus half a star). The salad accompanying the pita was meh.. Iceberg lettuce, a couple slices of tomato, a handful of parsley and a vinaigrette. First off, let's get some real lettuce on a salad, f*** this iceberg crap. And how about some veggies? (minus half a star).

Now the good. The falafel pita was damn good! Crisp on the outside, fluffy on the inside and tons of flavor. The hummus on top completed it. All that served in a pita that was thinner and had a little bit of a crisp to it was tasty. The rice was delicious as well; simple white rice with good seasoning and cooked perfectly. 

Overall I will be going back, though I may call ahead to minimize the wait."}
{"text":"Great experience! I had a kabob fattoush salad. Very fresh, huge serving, absolutely delicious. They take pride in their product and it shows. Friendly cashier who was very personable and interested in my needs. I will definitely be back! A+"}
{"text":"Two words: Baba ganoush. Dude. Go here and order the Baba! I'm going to call it \"Baba\" for short. Seriously.....the best ever. I was taken aback by the taste of this Baba. It was magical. The portion was generous and humbly served in a styrofoam bowl with a side of soft, warm pita bread. If I could just eat that, I would be a very happy food monster. 

I did also order the chicken kabob plate, which came with rice or fries(I got fries because fries are life), and a small salad. I honestly didn't eat much of the salad because I was full of THE BABA(it sounds more and more ridiculous the more I type it), fries, and chicken. The salad was the last invitee to this lunch party. Fries were crunchy and delicious, chicken was nice and charred in some areas, juicy and seasoned well. They served me two little cups of tzatziki and it was pretty tasty with a nice balance of cucumber pieces. 

Everything comes in styrofoam containers, which I'm typically turned off by, but I wasn't bothered by it at this place. Decent prices, friendly employees, lots of yummy choices, clean eating area. 

Go here and get you some Baba. What? You don't like Baba ganoush? Nah, you do. You just haven't had the Baba at this place yet."}
{"text":"This place has the worst service ever , and the server is very unfriendly and her service sucks , snooty waitress , overall it's just the worst place to go ever . I would not recommend this to no one . They don't deserve any star ever . Terrible place to eat and a bunch of snooty waitress .  Do not go to this restaurant ."}
{"text":"Would not recommend . Take out order was a mess.  The area that a customer is usually greeted and order taken was dirty and not attended. I actually had to call them on my phone to get someone to help me. They were unapologetic and indifferent when I told them I couldn't find anyone to take my order. The food was very mediocre and the gyros disappointing. The meat had obviously been frozen and tasted mushy and flavorless. It lacked the  Tzatziki sauce I like and the tabouli was very tart. The prices were high for the amount you received so I felt it came up short for everything. I will definitely not be returning or recommending this place to anyone I know."}
{"text":"Well it's 11:30am on a Friday which according to yelp and the signs on the door it should be open, but it's a ghost house inside. No other signs anywhere stating they are closed. I wonder if they closed up shop?"}
{"text":"I am currently addicted to hummus, and it's all because of Pita House! If I end up in hummus rehab, I am sending them the bill!

It had been ages since I had eaten any Mediterranean food, close to a decade. When I was in high school, a good friend's parents owned a Mediterranean/Greek cafe that I ate at often but after they closed due to medical issues, I never really found a replacement to get my Greek on. 

Pita House is that replacement. From the deliciously zesty tabouli to the juicy chicken kabobs to the addictive hummus... everything is made fresh, even the pita bread (which is amazing)! After my first visit to Pita House, I would get the most intense cravings for their hummus and I have yet to find a place that has anything quite as good as what PIta House serves up.

The restaurant itself is simple but it has always been very clean when I have gone in. The staff have always been extremely pleasant and helpful. There have been times I have gone months between visits, however the employees always seem to remember me and great me warmly. 

In a nutshell: Pita House has some super friendly employees serving up super super yummy food that is actually good for you AND will not break the bank. As far as I am concerned, for Mediterranean food in Las Vegas, Pita House is as good as it gets!"}
{"text":"One of the best sub $10 lunches i have had in a long time. 

The location is a bit off the path, but not impossible to find in the corner commercial center between an Auto Zone and Tire & Auto Center. Entering into the space its decorated a bit oddly with different array of colors, and patterns, but its not dirty which is a plus. Now for the important part....the grub! I was smacked in the face with the smell of meats and mouth watery goodness when i stood at the counter to order. Went with the simple Gyro Wrap $7.99 with a little salad and rice. Meal comes out to you in a styrofoam to-go style platter with the 3 sections inside for your meal. Eating into the salad first was fresh vegetables, tangy dressing (i like), and some plain and dry rice which i actually dig. If you like the dry Mexican rice then you will enjoy this as well. The wrap was a great sized portion with lots of meat and again fresh vegetables inside. VERY tasty, and very flavorful. I managed to finish my lunch but i could see how this could be a meal big enough to not be able to finish for some (no complaints there). For a sub $10 lunch and its not terrible over processed and relatively healthy option i find it hard to beat to be honest. There are a number of items that i am now curious to try because of my solid experience here. 

I must also mention that Susan, i believe someone else said she manages the place was very kind and attentive as well. She pays attention to the \"little things\", and that makes a difference for some. I never drink soda, so i opted for no drunk but was offered a water cup. Guests were finished eating in the dining room and she called out to them to ask if they needed a to go bag for their food. And when she steps into the dining room, she walks around and checks on people Some would say this is normal, but i find it all too common for people to simply stay behind the counter and do as little as possible. So thank you Susan, i will be back. 

Its not a date night destination, but for a no nonsense meal on the cheap its a winner."}
{"text":"Since I wrote my last review, the owner of the business reached out and told me that they have offered training for their staff, and offered to have me back at his expense.

I respect the owner willing to reach out and address individual customer complaints. This shows me that he is open minded and willing to take criticism and do what needs to be done in order to address it.

Since then I have been back three times, and I am happy to say that each of those experiences demonstrated that what he promised (that the staff has been trained and revamped) is indeed what he has been looking forward to. I went during the day and during the evening, and each time I was there, the staff was friendly and attentive, and willing to take initiative to please their customers.

I'm updating my review to four stars because most of all, I respect that Rashad the owner was willing to address customer concerns, and has shown the care for his business.

I plan on visiting in the future, and I hope this trend continues! Thanks to Rashad and his staff for a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Great service, friendly & helpful. grape leaves were delish.. I loved the house salad. Good priced :)"}
{"text":"Best falafel I've found yet in the Vegas area! Super fresh and owner/staff was so nice. We'll be going back over and over! Alraedy looking forward to our next trip there!

They add fresh mint and it takes the falafel to the next level! Halfway through my wrap, I was stuffed but couldn't stop myself from eating it all on the spot!"}
{"text":"I am personally not a fan of Mediterranean food but OMG this place is amazing! I never thought I would be a believer until I tried this place. I was actually at auto zone and I can smell the food from across the way and I thought, eh mind as well try it since it smelled so good. I got the chicken Shish Kabob meal. The chicken is super juicy and tastes so good and their garlic sauce is my favorite! I even like the salad they put on the side too. Now I crave this place all the time! lol"}
{"text":"It is my first time coming here. I asked for a recommendation and I tried the Beef Shawarma. I have no regret trying it out. It was delicious! The staff was very nice and food quality is excellent. I highly recommend this place."}

Thy dont allow less than 4 people inside
You need to sit out if your are less than 4

No good songs, nothing like mentioned on their website belly dance, dj n all"}
{"text":"Pita bread was stale, flat and hard..  How do you get the pita bread wrong at a pita house!  
The gyro meat reminded me of the McRib.  It had the lines of grill marks that looked painted on.  It was just bad.  Definitely Not fresh off the rotating roast.  Not sure what you call it when the meat spins and they slice if off for you.  Yea, NOT THAT!! 
Falafel tasted like it was frozen in a box and deep fried. Nothing special.  
French fries were good.  They saved me.  Cause everything else I threw away.  

Tzakiti sauce was horrendous.  Just don't. Go somewhere else.  Who needs food like this."}
{"text":"This place is good, but it's nothing special. The last time I was there it took about 30+ minutes to get our food which was pretty frustrating considering we had to be back at work soon. The set up is a little strange between the back dining room, the to go spot and the side patio. I think it's a little overpriced for what you get. Chicken kabobs are good, so is the vegetarian platter."}
{"text":"Best place in town for Mediterranean food! Hands down. Very authentic and fresh! Must try humus."}
{"text":"Love love love their food it's amazing!!! Great food and costumer service is excellent you won't be disappointed!!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible food greek salad tastes like oil an vinegar with no flavor. The chicken was very salty  looked like some other kinda meat.  The vegetable grape wraps are pickled an cold yuck."}
{"text":"Decent place for very casual Greek food. I only like getting food to go from here. I don't like eating in the restaurant as I don't find it very comfortable. We've tried about everything on the menu. Almost everything is good, except I could pass on the salad that comes with the meals. It's kind of bland and tasteless. Plus the gyro I usually get has a lot of the same vegetables in it already, so it's just more of the same. They have some kind of connectivity issue with their credit card machine, but won't admit it. I would think you'd want to get it working and have as many customers as possible, but that's just me. If I didn't have cash on hand last time I was there, they would have had to throw the food away and send me away angry! I'm sure it's already happened to them more than once. I can't be the only one. Little things like that can make or break a place in the minds of the customers."}
{"text":"Their chicken shawarma tastes (and looks) just like chicken salad. Fairly dry and absolutely devoid of spice: didn't taste or see any tahini or chili paste. Continuing that theme, the fries were soggy and unsalted. I was tempted to toss it out, but choked it down because I was starving."}
{"text":"Recently got into Mediterranean food. Love it here! \"Mom and pop\" type hospitality so you know the food is nearly homemade quality. I recommend the chicken shawarma with a side of French fries. And don't forget to ask for tahini sauce!"}
{"text":"Ok, I hate to be the one to leave a 3 star review. However, honesty is always the best policy. 

The first time I came here, it was pretty amazing. It's walking distance from my house, so that's a plus. I ordered the steak kabob platter, which comes with rice, pita bread and a salad. They were out of rice, so I got fries instead. No biggie cuz the fries were hot and crispy. The meat was tender and flavorful, which was excellent with the pita bread and tzatziki sauce. The salad was fresh and crispy. And the meal came with half a grilled tomato, which I added a good smokiness to everything. The bf and I enjoyed our meal very much, so I kept it in mind for future \"don't feel like cooking\" days. 

Second visit was a few days ago. I order the same thing, but subbed the fries for rice since it was available this time. I guess I didn't miss out on much the first time because the rice was just bland. Other pita places have flavored rice, and since their rice was yellow, you would expect some sort of seasoning. Some of my meat was undercooked that it was still bloody when I cut it open. And the pita bread that was so soft on my first visit was just hard and dry. And for some reason, I don't remember the vinaigrette dressing on the salad to be so sour. 

I hate leaving a 3 star review for family owned places. The owner is so sweet and friendly and makes sure that everything is ok. Maybe they just had an off day on my second visit :("}
{"text":"Please do not eat here. My husband and I got food poising and had to go to the ER."}
{"text":"I came to the Pita House for the free wifi, which is really convenient.  The food is pretty standard, but good.  I especially liked the hummus.  The atmosphere is pretty friendly, the waiters all seemed really nice, and only slightly weirded out that I was on my laptop there!"}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Mediterranean food!!  The best baba ghanoush in Vegas.  Chicken and beef shwarma were both delicious.  Hummus is hand made and yummy and the pita bread is baked right in front of you -- the best I've ever had.

Prices are great and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Interesting place with a choice of what in the US is called Mediterranean food and would be considered Arab food in Europe.

This might be Vegas but for my opinion the food was pretty greasy and and less healthy than I know Arab/Mediterranean food.

The drink fountain reminds of a fast food restaurant. 

The reason I decided to give only two stars is that I had lamb which didn't really taste like lamb.

If you want something fast and not overly healthy this is definitely a good place to go, better than any fast food chain."}
{"text":"Since my pupils actually dilate when I eat good Med. Food, this place had me at Garlic Sauce which I have not found at any other location in Las Vegas. My only teensy request is that they get a fruitier olive oil...the one they use is quite bitter. Other than that PERFECT!"}

This is the only place in Vegas we found that has authentic beef shawarma grilled on a traditional rotisserie grill. Most other Mediterranean resturants only have chicken shawarma on the rotisserie but no beef or bake the beef shawarma in the oven.

The Pita House did not dissapoint!!! It has been a weekly favorite for my husband and me. I love the chicken shawarma and he loves the beef. We always get it with fries. Not the healthiest choice, but the fries are always hot and so perfectly fresh they are hard to resist. The healthy salad makes up for it. I have learned that I don't have to eat all the fries as they give you a huge helping, and only enjoy a few to save room for the sandwich.

We alway order a couple pieces of bread to go and have it with breakfast the next morning.

Friendly service reasonable prices and really great food. 

If you love Mediterranean food, you won't be dissapointed!!!!"}
{"text":"It is a very good place for lunch.  Do not forget to order a side of babaganoosh and pita.  The lady owner is very nice."}
{"text":"I feel like I just spent $15 on a puny salad and French fries I could've got in the freezer section at Von's. I ordered two meals to go; one for lunch and one to bring to work for later. I ordered the falafel sandwich and the chicken shawarma. For lunch I tried half of each and both were completely disgusting. The falafel sandwich tasted like the sauce had soured like milk. I opened it up and the lettuce inside was completely rotten and brown. The falafel tasted old and terrible. The chicken shawarma was dry as hell and almost paste like. So needless to say the only thing edible was the French fries and the puny salad that came with the meal. Now I feel sick and have nothing to take to work for food. YUCK! Never again!!! Sad day :("}
{"text":"Anytime our family is in the mood for Mediterranean food i don't even have to ask where they want to eat, we like only the best and that means a trip to the Pita House. We lived for many years in Kuwait, Pita House is the only place in the US that makes amazing shawarmas chicken and lamb shawarmas like Kuwait. And the service is the best, we love this place."}
{"text":"I've been passing by Pita House on my way to work every day for the past 4 months, and have thought about stopping in, as it's right around the corner from my job. Years ago,  I lived in the Middle East and since I've been back in the States, I have never been able to find a place here that truly replicated the tastes I loved out there. So, I was a bit skeptical about Pita House. However, I was pleasantly surprised. I ordered a chicken shwarma sandwich, which came with rice (or fries) and a small salad. As soon as I opened up the shwarma, the smells took me back immediately to what I missed about the Middle East. It was absolutely delicious and I was in heaven! The staff was very helpful and friendly. I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Everything I've had there I've had better elsewhere. $7 falafel plate is too pricey (cheap ingredients, in Egypt this plate would cost you only $0.75 based on my personal experience). Dolmades or grape leaves dish was so-so. Finally, gyros isn't fresh off the spit as it should be for the best taste and quality. Based on taste and the identical cuts of each strip of gyros (only 4 measly slices for a $13 plate), I was able to tell the gyros was prepackaged and most likely frozen. Everything was edible at least, but far from what it could be and every item is overpriced due to the size and/or quality. I've got another Greek place in Phoenix area that serves much better Greek/Mediterranean food I'll go to instead."}
{"text":"This place has AMAZING Lebanese food!!!! Oh my goodness!!!!!!!! And they serve food late into the night like after the bars close!! Pretty awesome!!! Good hookah too. But their hummus is fantastic!!! Steak is fantastic!!!!"}
{"text":"My friend recommend this spot. It was very family style themed restaurant. The owner I believe she was very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Terrible terrible service, after the wait staff take your order expect to never see them again, not for refills, not to order more food or hookah. If you go here order everything you want for the night because after the hostess walks away you'll be lucky if you ever see a waitress, and bring a giant flag or a flare gun if you want a refill."}
{"text":"I love this hookah place such a chill spot to hang out and have a great time. They even have a dj and a small dance floor on the weekends along with a belly dancer."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place very much. The food, hookah, and service were all great! The staff was on top of making sure we were well taken care of."}
{"text":"I don't need to prove my awesome writing skills in my reviews.  I don't like to waste people's time by typing, typing and typing.  

So...

Great food, a little pricey, awesome staff...  Just a little short staffed, so remember to bring some extra time with you when you dine here.

4 Stars!"}
{"text":"It was good, not great, Meditaranean food, but then again, it was also inexpensive. The 2 kaftas were good, as was the fattoush salad. I didn't eat the puta, but it did not look like they make their own. I'll eat here again if I'm in the neighborhood and I get a craving, but I wouldn't make this a destination on its own."}
{"text":"OMG....we found this place on Yelp, it is hidden behind a Tire Works in the AutoZone shopping center on Silverado Ranch.

They make everything fresh to order and the food is Amazing.

First off you are greeted when you walk in the door like you are family coming over for a meal..(family you want to spend a meal with).  They have a great menu with a wide variety of selections.  We started off with a Zaata which is like WOW.  We will be back tomorrow to get one to bring home.  I also had an order of falafel and a Gyro which come with a choice of rice or fries and a small salad.

They serve the food in styrofoam containers which we liked because you really needed to bring some home.  The portions are a very good size.

They have sauces of course depending on what you order and they will give you extra if needed but don't waste them because they are amazing.  

This is a family owned and run place open 7 days a week from 11am to 8pm and we are SO EXCITED to find this place so close to our house.  They use quality products and do not use any chemicals or additives in their foods.  Everything was amazing and even though it's not organic, it is of the highest quality with some of the most amazing family recipes you will find.  

I have tried a lot of places and by far this is the best I have found and we will be back.  This is a place you have to try...."}
{"text":"Horrible dark dirty place, bad service, totally in-authentic food. Anyone who thinks this is good Med food was born, raised and lived in Apache Junction their entire  life"}
{"text":"This is a little Ma and Pa place.  Very sweet.  Everything was fresh.  The hummus was ok. I like mine more garlicky but they can't really be faulted - the have to please the general public and I like everything very  very spicy. I loved the Babajanoush (sp?) super creamy and made with good ingredients and home country / recipe pride (you can just tell!). The pita bread was warm and fluffy and they give you a good amount.  Also really liked the tabulli - perfect mix of oil, cilantro, tomato and grain.  Everything was in balance.  Very nice lunch."}
{"text":"Watch you back/wallet here.  My bill Total was exactly $23.  They taxed me at $3.65 essentially doubling the tax and denied the rather easy math.  Further, told me a itemized receipt could not be printed.  If you have a large order their their \"bonus\" will add up."}
{"text":"I used to love this place. Ordered gyros from take out. Place looked dirty..gyros were small, one had dill pickles on it ??? Vitually no taziki sauce, and very small. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Excellent food. the Pita House provides a type of food not offered on a mass scale. the food is always prepared to perfection and I have never had a bad experience. The girl who i have gone here with was born and raised in Syria and has vouched that food is very authentic and embodies the culture of the middle east. Great Place"}
{"text":"One of the worst experiences we have had in Scottsdale. Went to pita house because they were featured in Local Dines. We had $30 to spend. As we ate our mediocre dinner the only thing they made it totable was the thought of getting a discount. The bill came (unlike half of my dinner) and they refused to honor the Local Dines coupon.  Needless to say we will not return and are letting you know to pick another place."}
{"text":"Best Middle Eastern- Lebanese food ever! I visited this new place on our last trip. 
Very authentic flavors. Fresh Pita bread from the oven. The chef knows what he is doing! I love the Man2oush- Little pies filled with cheese, meat, spinach... They are to die for. I was also lucky to eat to small fried Kebbeh!!! Amazing."}
{"text":"So disappointed.  Had low expectations with 3 stars but they under performed even the lowest of expectations.  Ordered the chix shawarma and asked for them to put some hot sauce inside..... 'We can't do that but I'll put some on the side for you'.   Never received, just day old stale pita with dry chicken.  Even the tomatoes were dry!    Pass on this place as it gives a bad rap to reall, you're umma, Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"Upon getting to Pita House I was told to take a menu (which was dirty and sticky) and wait outside for my order to be taken. It took 15 minuets for someone to come help me, I ordered a bottle of water and Beef Shawarma, and french fries. I waited an additional 15 minuets for my food, I expected it to be piping hot but that was not the case. The fries where cold enough for my 2 year old to eat right away and the beef was room temperature as well. As for my favorite part of any Middle Eastern meal- the tzatziki, was also a fail. The consistency was great but it lacked in flavor.

I remember coming here when I was younger for the hookah, and I liked the food. But I guess the hookah made it seem better than it actually was"}
{"text":"Went to grab a quick bite yesterday with a colleague and we decided to go to Pita House.  Big Mistake.

We called in our order and the gal on the phone seemed like it we were putting her out.  I guess the computer in the non restaurant section (where we'd be picking up our food) was down.  We weren't told how long it would be or how much our order was going to cost.  I ordered the gyro pita with the house salad. 

We head over, pay and get out order (the gal seemed irritated to have to walk over to the other side to run the card), and head back to work.  I dive into my lunch and something is off.  The salad was warm, like wilted warm.  Who wants to eat warm floppy lettuce?  Anyone...Anyone...Bueller?    

My gyro was drowning in tzatziki.  I ended up throwing most of my lunch away -  there was no salvaging any of it.  Not sure if there's new owners or management...but the quality and customer service has definitely gone downhill.  

If I return, it wont be for a while."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. My mom always brings it home (2 chicken shawarmas) and it feeds 4! Good portions and the pita is to die for! Definitely a must try."}
{"text":"Best Lebanese/middle eastern food in town. 
Lived in Vegas for over 20 years, by far this is the best place ever for kabobs and hummos, fattoush and tabouli salads...
The service is so great it is my second home.
I love Susan!"}
{"text":"Love love love Pita House. Freshest way to eat without cooking it yourself. (But way better than anything I can cook myself!!) The lamb kabob, lamb kafta, beef kabob, beef and chicken shawarma... All outstandingly flavorful, perfectly seasoned and expertly cooked. Salads are crisp, and wonderfully dressed. The hummus, babaganoush, super soft and dipable pita bread, make my mouth water just thinking about it all. 

But the favorite item that brings it all together here... the traditional Lebanese \"garlic sauce\", or toum. It's fluffy, and creamy, and a garlic lovers heaven. You could dip a flip flop in this stuff and you'd be asking for more. And executing this sauce when trying to make it yourself is challenging to say the least (ahem...), so leave it to the experts at Pita House and order extra with everything. 

A+++! We will always come back!!! Please never go away!"}
{"text":"I had the gyro wrap at Pita House. It came with a small salad and choice of basmati rice or fries. I thought it was really good. The lady who took our order was nice too."}
{"text":"I went to Pita House for lunch for the first time today and was very unimpressed. My order took way too long, the waitress wasn't very attentive, and the food was not good. The classic gyro I ordered was bland and the iceberg lettuce and tomatoes did not seem fresh. The \"salad\" was just a pile of iceberg lettuce with a tiny bit of dressing. For the quality of the meal the price was way too high. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Every time I come to Phoenix, I eat here. $5.99 for a hummus pita with a side salad. Imad took great care of me; so engaging. This is amazing hummus and pita bread. Tucked away in Old Town in a corner shopping center, it has outdoor seating too. I always sit in one of the little tables inside the order area; didn't realize till this past visit there was actually a bigger sitting area! 

I should branch out and order something else...but I won't because I seriously enjoy their hummus pita!! 

This beats the $120 I forked over at a sushi place this visit."}
{"text":"This is literally a mom and pop operation with just one other worker and a single customer on the Sunday I visited.  My wife and I needed a snack to carry us over to dinner so I stopped in for an order of spinach fatayers (pies) that were already prepared, but baked to order.  It took probably 5 or so minutes and I was on my way out to the car where we ate them.  Unfortunately, the pastry was more like a roll without much flavor though the spinach filling was pretty good.  Menu prices seemed very reasonable and I noticed that a daily special was listed on a board so those stopping by should check it out."}
{"text":"In from Chicago for business. Stopped here for dinner and it did not disappoint.  I took down 2 platters- one vege and one kabob combo. The meats were fantastic and hummus and baba were spot on. Pickles and tomatoes and falafel on vege platter were perfect. If this place were in Chicago I would go back."}
{"text":"I came here after picking up some alterations next door.... I got the pita bread, humus and salad.... Delicious !!! Good customer service ! And vegan options."}
{"text":"So we wandered into Pita House on a Sunday afternoon. It's small and unassuming. It plays techno Middle Eastern music, shows Egyptian pride commercials on their one TV and the walls are painted to look like they're cracked stone and like you're in someone's pyramid basement. 

AND IT IS DELICIOUS.

The falafel. THE FALAFEL. Perfectly crispy on the outside and deliciously falafely on the inside. Three tasty falafel patties stuffed into a tasty warm pita with veggies and tahini sauce. As someone else noted, their very simple salad (uhh, lettuce and a tomato slice) is topped with a dressing made of the tears of fairies and hopes and dreams.

The tahini was added slightly on the heavy side for my liking, kind of drowning my whole falafel pita, but that's my own fault. I generally ask for it on the side and it just skipped my mind this time. No big deal. We were the only ones in there for a while but 5 or 6 other tables came in while we were finishing lunch. There was only one girl running both the dining room and the to-go shack (who looked about 15 years old) but she was taking care of everything pretty easily.  Pita House is a perfect cheap lunch decision and...I might need to get down there this afternoon."}
{"text":"Pretty good ... They cook their Kabob to your desire of wellness ... I actually saw a raw beef on the grill ... I'll be back for sure ..."}
{"text":"I will never go to pita house again. I had to get up 3 times to order my food and drinks because the waiters were neglecting us. We got margaritas, redbull vodkas and rum and coke. With out telling us they used the most expensive liquors. Grey goose for the redbull patron for the margarita and crown royal with rum and coke. On top of that they added an extra drink and they wouldn't give us a refund. Don't go here, for hookah go to oasis around the corner."}
{"text":"Great place really good everything, a bit expensive but we like the place, very clean and the people are friendly."}
{"text":"I ordered from here via UberEATS and had food delivered to my hotel. I ordered the falafel salad and it was one of the worst things I've ever had. The falafel balls have to be frozen, pre-made balls that they heat up. Absolutely dreadful in taste and texture. The falafels are all identical in size and it's sad that they'd stoop so low. Do yourself a favor and don't eat here. I wish I hadn't."}
{"text":"Really overpriced for a small not so good gyro pita the meat tastes over cooked or old. Barely any sauce. The side it comes with is a small salad or 4 leaves  and cucumber of lettuce and no drink."}
{"text":"Can You Say YummY!!!!! Just had my 3ed meal here today the food is the best .  Everything the place the people know how run it are so Awesome Wow!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Very Friendly staff, Food is AMAZING!! The hummus is to die for. The best that I've ever had. And the pita bread...homemade fresh and sooooo good! I usually get the beef and lamb gyro which couldn't taste better! And don't get me started on the Baklava which is also amazing! lol  Definitely a place to try...you will NOT be disappointed!!!! The ONLY Mediterranean place I will eat at! There is nothing that i have tried here that I don't like. Pita house please open another one near boulder and trop close to my house lol"}
{"text":"The worse middle eastern food I have ever had.  Looks like it's more a hookah place then a place you will want to eat.  The server was rude and the food was not fresh.  Never again."}
{"text":"Stay away. I don't think they need new business. First, the service was horrible. No one would help us, but they would help their friends that were there. We waited 10 minutes, asked for help several times, and then finally had someone agree to help us. Second, its very dirty-- the bathrooms were horrible. It was so nasty I could not eat the hummus when I returned from the bathroom. Third, they never even helped us with our hookah, even when they could clearly see we has no clue how to maintain it. And, they told us we have to leave because they were \"closing\" but we actually found out they were supposed to open for another hour. If they want people to come back then they need to provide way better service and not discriminate."}
{"text":"I was casing this place to see if it could measure up and be included in the lunch rotation.  Instead, it became an anecdote.  Or maybe I didn't measure up, and was being encouraged not to include Pita House in my lunch rotation.  About halfway through my visit, I knew this was a one-time visit.  All the signs were piling up.  I entered the take out section and was led to the dining area.  Obviously a first timer, the waitress seemed bemused by my newness and uncompelled to offer any assistance.  Maybe she knew I wasn't returning before I did.  I felt like I was being marked for sides, drinks, and up sales rather than being welcomed.  By the time the food came, I had already decided not to return unless it was the best lunch ever and the meal was between okay and good, but closer to good.  There are so few places where rudeness is part of the charm of the place.  It is just so hard to pull off.  I had the chicken shawarma.  The chicken cubes were juicy, and the tahini sauce was good, but lacking.  On the plus side, there doesn't seem to be a shortage of restaurants in downtown Scottsdale.  Next!!"}
{"text":"We were so sad when yalla closed. But finally tried pita house today. Everything was so good.   This will be our new go to for Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"When we went to this place the first time the food was great and service wasn't bad either. So today we decided, since it's really close to our house we'll stop for a gyro! We went there, set down and we didn't have anyone come to our table for at least 15 mins! Finally the waiter arrived, took our order ( I ordered the classic gyro with fries, and my boyfriend ordered the same thing but chose salad instead) . When we received the food they both had salad, no fries! So I kindly asked for the fries that I ordered and the waiter apologized and said they will be right out. However, he charged me additional $$ just for the fries ( they were part of the meal!!!) 
Anyways, I won't be returning here after tonight!!!
It seemed like no one was there to actually work!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit and will not be our last. The chicken kabob was wonderful, perfectly cooked, very moist and tender with good flavors. My husband had the beef skewer plate and was thoroughly pleased with his meal. The meat was not greasy and the rice was fluffy. Looks like this is going to be our new go-to Mediterranean restaurant."}
{"text":"Best falafel spot!! Will be back again. Portions are huge, falafels fresh, and service is great!"}
{"text":"Service was slow but I'm not blaming the waiter... It seemed as if there was only one person cooking taking orders and managing 10 tables at a time. The food was good tasting and I'd rate it 4/5. In regards to portion size I ordered a chicken shawarma dinner plate for $15.00 thinking I'd get a little bit more than an average shwarma sandwich. I was wrong. I received maybe... A handful of rice on the side and I had already paid to upgrade my salad to a fatoush... In reality I was disappointed. It was basically a unraveled shawarma sandwich with non of the greens inside and a handful of rice. Portion size 2/5.  Lastly they didn't seem to fond of the fact that we used Groupon.. We were told something else other than what we had purchased on Groupon so it wasn't cool at all. For example on Groupon we bought 30.00$ value meal for 16.00 whereas when we got there we were told they wouldn't honor it... And in fact we would have to spend 50.00$  and they would knock it off. I'm not sure if I will be back here again..."}
{"text":"The worst customer service!! The employees are the rudest ppl in old town. They obviously do not know English!!! I ordered the combination kabobs and they brought out the wrong thing. The waiter proceeded to argue with me saying that combination and combo isn't the same word. I told him that combo is short for combination and he said no it's not"}
{"text":"The place is terrible. Including the service. Went tonight, waiter basically forgot drinks and everything we asked for. Never checked on us. We flagged another waiter, who didn't care to help us either. it wasn't even busy - we went on a week night. I hate posting reviews like this, but if you have a restaurant, treat customers like, you actually appreciate their business. Not sure if the staff is mainly family, but there's no consideration or customer service -- lack of friendliness. No one comes to clean your hookah, so it tastes like ash after while. The bathrooms are disgusting. Menus aren't clean and feel sticky. Seats had rips and tears. And there was men asleep in the booths, either drunk or making themselves too at home. Its actually creepy. I'm not sure if the city is grading their restaurant, but i have no idea how it passes inspection or stays in business.
Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Great place to order takeout. We have only eaten inside once and I'd rather just take it home. I guess the dine in experience gives this place it's 3 star rating. Other than that, I don't get it. They have great food!"}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken kabob plate and my friend got the beef gyro. Both plates comes with fatosh salad and an option of rice or fries. We both choose rice as it was the lesser of two fatty evils. 

My chicken kabob was very good. The meat was not too dry and paired with the garlic sauce it was amazing. Alone it tasted fine but I think you definitely need a sauce with it. My portion was considerably smaller than my friends gyro plate. The gyro is a greek sandwich that comes with lettuce onions tomatoes and Taziki sauce. That was pretty delicious as well. 

If I come here again, I might go with the gyro. But if you want a healthier option, nothing beats the chicken breast kabobs."}
{"text":"Went in on my lunch break, friendly customer service. I ordered the beef Greek salad it was amazing! Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Great tasting food. At first, I wasn't sure if I wanted to give this place a try but I'm glad I did. I ordered several things from the menu and was Not disappointed. I ordered for pick up and food was ready upon arrival. 
The hummus is soooooo good!! I'll definitely order from here again. The pricing is reasonable too. You can order a plate for under $10.00."}
{"text":"Extremely and unnecessarily aggressive bouncer.  I had grabbed take out from here a few times in the past- and sadly it's decent food.  However on this evening, a friend and I went into the hookah/ bar section for a drink toward the end of the night.  We each had a drink and while standing at the back bar noticed a guy hovering.  Not too concerned.  The place was close to closing and we went outside to call an Uber.  While we are standing in the PUBIC parking lot, the bouncer from the place storms out and yells at us to \"stop touching the owners car\".  It was the guy who was hovering near us at the bar.  He is immediately very aggressive and at no point tried to calmly engage us.  We tried explaining we were not touching the car, just waiting for our Uber and would be gone momentarily.  He was not having it and started screaming at us about calling the cops and that we couldn't stand there.  I agreed that he should call the police if he felt it necessary and as he was grabbing his phone a pen fell out of his pocket.  I picked it up for him and handed it to him and his response was \"Don't f*ing touch my stuff\".  How professional.  Thankfully, the police did arrive and were amazing.  One officer stood with us (in the same public spot) while our car arrived while the other brought the terrible bouncer back into the establishment and hopefully away from any other potential customers/victims of his misdirected rage.  The officer literally asked us \"Why were we even called??\".  Good question.  Hats off to our Scottsdale police for handling the situation well and making sure everyone got home safe.  Will certainly not visit this place again, at least as long as this guy is employed there."}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend and a couple friends. The gyro was OK at best compared to ones I've had at other locations. The lamb was in filets like frozen fish sticks? Tzaziki sauce was pretty much absent and tomatoes were on the side. The cheap-tasting salad dressing was very off-puttingly salty and the dessert tasted like soap. We had to ask to get it taken off the bill because it was so awful. Tipped the waitress extra because we felt bad for her. This place has gone way downhill since my bf last visited.

PS their storefront is spelled wrong? Wtf!!!!"}
{"text":"I have come here a couple times for the hookah, this is the second time I had bad service from the same server that goes by Z. I was there around 5pm on Friday night and it was not busy at all . We had to yell to get the attention of the staff when we arrived which was the server Z. We got our beer and and water and waited for over 10 minutes. I finially asked the man making the hookahs how much longer and he knew nothing about our order. Then I asked Z and she said he was new and we should be sympathetic, but it was not his fault she did not tell him our order. She tried to blame it on him. I told her I would not wait any longer and I was leaving. This was my second time receiving poor service from the same woman. If you are looking for good hookah I would suggest I-MAD in scottsdale and will never go to Pita House again."}
{"text":"The food was great and the people were friendly, they have a cool little bar in the restaurant!"}
{"text":"Terrible  business, they bully anyone who leaves an honest review on their Facebook page. Then they have their family and friends troll them. Stay away from that place"}
{"text":"This place sucks we literally waited an hour for our hookah and the they don't wash their bowls the guy there cussed us out because we wanted our flavor changed and we didn't even smoke it and also wanted to charge us 18 dollars they charge for you water not worth your money the waiters there are rude as hell"}
{"text":"Better than Pita Pit across the street. For $5.99 I had a falafel and salad. It was great and fresh. The only reason I gave four stars is because i wish the actual falafel was bigger. The spices and everything is great.

Service very friendly!
Im sure ill return."}
{"text":"Super fresh. Loved the Homemade Pita. Tabouli was excellent. The cooks got slammed when I came ...so my order took a few minutes- but I'm definitely coming again. So happy to have a place like this close to my house!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Everything was delicious! Friendly staff and good
prices.. My new regular lunch place..."}
{"text":"Loved this little place!!! It's a quiet little spot and the food is great I had the lamb kabobs. The lamb was flavorfull and tender it was amazing had it with the rice and salad great food . The staff was all very friendly, very inviting we will for sure be back... this just took over for me favorite Greek place... If food is like this in Greece I need to go!!!"}
{"text":"I've driven by Pita House a number of times and always wanted to try it.  I'm a huge fan of Pita Jungle so I had to try the competition.  I have to say, it was pretty good.  Everything seemed very fresh and was full of taste.  We were there just when they opened for lunch so it wasn't very crowded...which is good since they don't have that many tables.  The outside \"patio\" is really an extension of the parking lot.  Nothing like dining outside in Arizona in the summertime, I say!  
Another plus is that they serve beer; the selection was pretty decent too.  Oh, and, you can place your order online and they'll have it ready for you when you get there."}
{"text":"Dining or catering, this is the best mediteranian in the southeast. Shawarma is delicious. Combo kabob is delicious and feeds two. The owner Susan is the greatest."}
{"text":"Good place. I have been coming here for years. It's even better now that they expanded and purchased the coffee shop next door (which is now the Pita House bar).

The food is good, the patio and new bar are are set-up well. Service is reasonable and the staff are very friendly. Good solid food at a fair price.

I have yet to try one of the hookahs on their outdoor patio, though I intend to imbibe one of these evenings real soon."}
{"text":"I LOVE mediterranean food. Especially, when the pita bread is freshly cooked from the oven. The bread reminds me of Khoury's fresh bread. The woman who I think was the owner was very nice and honestly I was not disappointed in anything I ordered. I got hummus, fresh bread, chicken kabob with basmati rice and a salad. The prices were cheap as well I believe my chicken kabob was only $7.99 and my hummus was $3.99. They serve huge portions. They lack a little bit in timing since it did take a while but I will definitely return.

Free delivery within distance ;)

PROS: Hummus, Chicken Kabob and Fatoush salad, owner was kind, clean, cheap
CONS: Food takes a while"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite mediterranean restaurant in Vegas very authentic food and great service."}
{"text":"Ordered off Postmates tonight. Would never recommend this food to anyone. The lamb tatsed like char, the French fries were soggy and had a funky taste...Not sure how you mess up French fries. I asked for extra tzatziki sauce, which was lacking. The sauce itself didn't taste right. The \"house salad\" was lettuce with a soggy old tomato slice cut in half. They shouldn't even cook food here."}
{"text":"This place has some good grub.  Everything is fresh and made in house, which the lady at the counter kept reminding me, but she did habe to because it shows in thier food!

The meat was flavorful and tender the hummis was fresh and delicious and the pita bread tasted homemade too!"}
{"text":"Came in during my lunch break for a Gyro. Waited 5 mins before anyone came out to help (I thought, maybe they are busy with lunch orders). Was greeted with attitude. \"Yea... and what do you want?\" -Cashier/Server girl. I asked for a gyro with no onions, no tzatziki sauce, and add feta. Pretty basic order. The girl verified I wanted no tzatziki sauce. She then followed  her question with \"You just need to raise your standards then.\" As of this point, I'm hungry and I just want my food. I sat down and waited for my meal. 30 mins pass, no food. I couple that was their before I asked if they could at least get their hummus. That same girl replied, \"Oh yea, it was sitting here. Here you go.\" Now the moment I have been waiting for. My food arrived. It had extra tzatziki sauce, no onion and no feta. I politely told the girl that I asked for no tzatziki sauce and add feta. And I asked her to send it back. I then asked her to make it to go because I only get an hour lunch break. As of this point it has been 45 mins since I have ordered. When I received my order, again. I noticed all they did was take the meat that had tzatziki sauce on them off the sandwich and threw on feta. I am not impressed nor pleased with this situation. I recommend to go anywhere else but here."}
{"text":"The food is amazing in all aspects!! The kabobs .. gyros.. pita.. and GARLIC SAUCE!!  Not to mention an amazing staff.. we will be coming back on a regular basis."}
{"text":"This place is not what you expect when you drive by to find it tucked behind auto stores. The staff is pleasant, helpful and spot on with the orders every single time I call an order in. (Yes, that's a rare thing in Vegas).  The grape leaves are fresh and not days old, and the hummus is to die for! There's always enough to take home for dinner. The chicken Shawarma sandwich is the only reason for the 4 stars! I like white lean chicken, not chunks of random. You can bypass this dilemma by doing the beef which is much leaner and tastier. Finally, I love the variety of hot sauces, nom nom! Keep it up, and I'll keep coming!!!"}
{"text":"Cannot sing enough praise about this place. My good is always fresh, hot, and DELICIOUS, every time I order from here. Everyone is always so nice, I'm so glad it's close to my job, because I'm a lifetime customer."}
{"text":"Just not making no sense when this place get full every time I go there , like seriously what's up with those negative review people are something else , I really like this place I have 0 comments."}
{"text":"We came in the late afternoon and one aspect of this place that definitely stood out was the great customer service. 

Visited here with a pita craving and wasn't necessarily disappointed but noticed very little consistency across the various items we ordered which included the meat pies, kibbeh balls, beef shawarma, chicken shawarma, and beef kabob. 

The meat pies were a random spur of the moment order because we never heard of them, in hindsight probably a bad choice. The breading to meat ratio was too imbalanced and just tasted like a very yeasty piece of bread. All in all, a non order next time. 

The kibbeh balls are excellent, an order I always go to at pita places for a starter. Although, these are probably hard not to do correctly, but nevertheless delicious. 

The beef and chicken shawarma receive similar criticisms as the meat pies. Too much breading and not enough meat, the beef was slightly better than the chicken due to the dryness of the chicken. Not sure if I went on an off day or if they use a not so juicy part of the chicken but it was fairly tough to chew and get down. 

Best dish by far out of the ones we ordered was the beef kabob. The regular sizing comes with 6 generous pieces of beef. I asked for medium-rare and received what looked to be well done with no pink at all, but it was still delicious and cooked to a tender texture that wasn't super hard
to chew. The rice here is the bomb too, not sure what they cook it with but it comes out an almost golden color and has a nice savory kind of buttery taste to it that goes super well with the beef. The other item on the side of the meat is the side salad which is also awesome. Pretty standard side salad you find at most pita/Mediterranean places but what stands out is the delicious croutons they use. I actually mistook it as bacon at first until I bit into one and was pleasantly surprised by the crunchy flavorful treat that hit my mouth. 

All in all, this place was \"pretty\" good but would visit other pita places very close by when given a choice. Seems to be too many inconsistencies in the menu for multiple revisits, unless you're the type who orders the same thing every time."}
{"text":"Best authentic Greek food on this side of town. The bread is freshly baked and it is AWESOME!!!!!!!! All of the food is cooked fresh, not processed! The customer service is excellent. 

I usually eat here twice a week."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place very much. 
Food is delicious. Good Lebanese food. 
Staff is friendly and helpfull. 
I recommend going there."}
{"text":"The worse customer service ever , I don't recommend this place for anything. The food was terrible and the hookah was not any better. The waiter took forever just to bring us water. When the hookah finally arrived they never came to check in it or even bother to bring new charcoal."}
{"text":"This is the most authentic Lebanese food you can find in Vegas. I have lived here all my life and this is hands down the best you will get!"}
{"text":"Very very satisfied with the food I was in the area getting prescription filled at CVS and I've actually never been in this area there is another Mediterranean restaurant across the street and this one felt more mom-and-pop - so I came to this location and I had falafel she gave me a free sample of tabouli and it was delicious I'll definitely come again"}
{"text":"What's good on the menu? EVERYTHING. All their meat , cooked to perfection. Their wraps? Made with the hand of god himself . The Pita and hummus ? No words. Always warm and straight out of your home oven. Creamy with a bit of oil. Enough to get you to think it's the one element not on the periodic table. All the veggies , perfect , salad ? One of a kind . The fries , the glorious tahini and the baba g , and the dessert... WOW. Go get yourself some baklava right now. Get some falafel wraps and veggie wraps right now If you're a vegan / vegetarian or just a foodie looking for fresh , homemade , organic bites.. And top that off with an entire entree of their vegetarian.. But wait there's more..  Get yourself a plate , actually many plates , maybe even a couple boxes.. Because you'll be coming back the next day , and next year you'll be wondering if it's still 2015 , because by then Pita House will be your new home now... if I could, I would pay to have this place in my own kitchen. There's a reason why this place is the best of 2015. 

And what makes the food truly a keeper , is the love it's made with. A huge thank you to the staff . Great people with even bigger hearts. THANK YOU FOR ALL YOU DO. Boom."}
{"text":"I always forget how good this place is because I have to pass Yanni's to get there. But it really is great, with lots of house-made goodness, including fresh pitas. Their gyros meat is fresh and flavorful, and the falafel has exactly the kind of complex, rich, nutty savoriness you want in the dish. Sandwiches come with salad and fries. Don't recommend the fries. Salad is great, refreshing and flavorful with peppers, tomatoes and chunks of pita in a light vinaigrette type dressing."}
{"text":"This is one of those places where I feel like food is an afterthought. An afterthought to what, you ask? Well, I'm not exactly sure. All I know was that nothing was both edible and impressive. 

The hummus was lemony and tahini-y, but seemed mediocre, mostly because the pitas that came with it were stale and cold. They were out of rice and gave us salad instead (as if that's somehow comparable.) Plus, none of it was cheap, and since I should be paying in shekels for this stuff, I was a bit confused as to what warranted its price. Maybe because it's in Old Town Scottsdale and dumb tourists will throw their money at everything made of faux-adobe? Regardless, the rest of us don't appreciate poor value.

On to the better aspects... it's open really, really late. That means you can get a round of hookah at 11 and chill until 1:30 in the morning while waiters constantly bring you new coals and shisha refills. The shisha is decent, too. They have all the flavors your dentist used to offer you in fluoride when you were 7, and then some. We had the cherry, which didn't even taste faintly of medicine, so I was content as far as that goes.

Overall, it's a nice late-night hangout spot. The hookah's good. The outside seating is warm. The food is nether good, nor warm, but that's not why you're there, remember? You're there to enjoy being in a nice setting at one in the morning, as am I."}
{"text":"Went here while looking for a good place for dinner I am a huge fan of Mediterranean. Walked In welcomed into a very friendly environment. I had the gyro with fries it was so good!! Pretty big came with two big halves and a salad and fries. Want to go back and try more. If you are in the area worth trying!!"}
{"text":"Favorite hookah spot in town! Great mid day service for homework time! Free wifi and awesome gyros"}
{"text":"I'm no expert when it comes to Mediterranean food but nom nom!!   The owners are always very nice and pleasant.  The food always tastes fresh and yummy.  The wife told us that her husband gets their olive oil from a very far away country (I totally forget where) and it takes a month to arrive- cray cray..  (okay so you caught me, I took a mental vacation the minute she expelled the details and was back to catch the end of it-oopsie for having A.D.D.)

So they have the three meat options: Chicken, Beef and Lamb, all on a huge skewer, cooker, rotater thing and the boyfriend always gets chicken wrap thing (don't know the technical correct term for it) and it comes with a small salad and rice (or fries).  Whatever they use to cook that rice is absolutely tasty and delicious!!  They also have skewers of meat.

baba ghanoush deserves a paragraph of it's own.  HELLO!!  So the first time we went, I ordered the hummus and inquired about the baba ghanoush (I had no idea what it was?!).  The owner was nice enough to give us a little sample and to my surprise, I actually prefer the baba G over Hummus?!  So super delicious!! And the Pita, ohhhhh the Pita, so warm, fresh and good- I could eat just the pita by itself!  And for the price, you get a very generous serving and trust me, you'll love it!  Now we order an extra side of pita because that bad boy doesn't stand a chance!

So Miss. Vegetarian over here gets the filafel.  Sometimes I order it as a sandwich/wrap thing and sometimes I just get the balls plain with the rice and salad.  There's absolutely no guilt eating here because everything tastes so darn fresh and good!!  ...and we never order the french fries...

The last time we were there, we got stuck behind two other orders and it took a loooonnnnggg time....  but we weren't in a rush...  and to be quite frank, we didn't mind much...  and I'd rather have fresh cooked food (just like making it at home) and waiting....than frozen heated up food, or stale food for that matter.  BUT I must put it into perspective, we would have waited just as long at Cheesecake Factory or some other large restaurant for our food... so what's the difference??? none.  only love for this place.

So anywho, give this place a shot, I think they deserve a fighting chance in our neighborhood.  Good, simple, healthy eats and genuinely nice owners behind that counter."}
{"text":"I got some take-out from here the other night in spite of the objections of my roommate.  Dude, am I glad I didn't listen to that idiot.  (She's never even eaten here before, but thought it looked dodgey from the outside).  I got the chicken gyro pita with an extra side of tzatsiki.  The staff was pleasant and super quick. I've spent more time waiting at the McDonald's drive-thru; I was probably in and out of there in 5-7 minutes.  The food was tasty - pita appeared fresh out of the oven (I don't know if it actually was), chicken was juicy & flavorful, and veggies were fresh.  Their pitas/sandwiches come with a side salad that constists of pretty much just shredded lettuce and dressing, but I won't knock it since I ate all of it.   I wish their portions were a little bigger for what I paid, but all in all, a good experience.  I'll probably be back next time I'm craving Mediterranean food in a hurry, because it definitinely hit the spot."}
{"text":"Loved the pita, which was super fresh! The hummus was good. I had the chicken kabobs which were tasty. I just wish the pieces had been smaller. Garlic sauce was mmm mmm good!"}
{"text":"Was craving a good kafta sandwich and this is the place to calm the craving.  Got the kafta wrap with fries and salad.  Spices were right and portions were solid.  This is a great place to get good food."}
{"text":"Tough location to make a go, but the food is good.  I had the Gyros Pita plate.  The meat was extremely tender.  I personally liked it better than the Yanni's nearby (although Yanni's has some delish fries).

The staff are friendly and eager to please.  The food was good and appropriately priced.  Good to have in the neighborhood.  I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"After seeing the great reveiews decided to give this place a try.  Boy am I glad I did.  The owner is fantastic an really interacts with her customers.  What a charactere - fun! 
On her reccommendation I tried the beef kafta - yummy with the basmatic rice - light and delicious..  My DH got the Kabob Salad with Beef Skewer.  He is a butcher by trade and is very picky of the meat he is served and he loved it.  We also ordered the hummus, oh my gosh so good.  First off it comes in a 16oz deli container.  If you can't eat it all - no worries slap the lid on it and take it home. For $3.99 people - that's a deal.  But most importantly of all their Pita Bread - this isn't called the Pita House for nothing.   It comes straight out of the oven and to your table.  You can smell it cooking in the pita oven (imported from Lebanon).  At $1.00 each pita of course I had to take some home with all my leftover hummus.  To top it all off she brought us some complementary baklava at the end of the meal.  We felt like family.

Daily specials and Sunday - really specials, family favorites.  

Thanks for making this a great meal and experience. 

We will be back."}
{"text":"Great staff and great food. Pricing was good for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"Gross. New owners. New salad. New garlic dip (now made with mayonnaise). Sub par now."}
{"text":"Spent $20 on two gyro classics , the tzatziki was unimpressive to say the least , it was runny and water had more flavor !!  The girl at the front was pleasant , but told me she couldn't take my order for a few minutes because she was temporarily fired... overall I don't see my self being a repeat customer here."}
{"text":"This carry out diner makes quality restaurant entrees. I have not had a disappointing selection here."}
{"text":"Place is always on point! Very fresh & they make it with love! Had to drop a good review! Best hummus & pita ever! Beef kabobs are so great!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing lamb chops, amazing eggplant dip (thought I would hate it) amazing customer service! Will be back! T is the best server ever!"}
{"text":"A staple as far as great food! This family does It right! The falafel is the best in the city!! There's nothing I haven't tried that I don't love. And hey when you have the option of adding fries to your meal how can It not be great!!!"}
{"text":"Falafel wrap + fries + delicious salad for $6.99 is a amazing deal. Fast and very friendly service. Will keep coming back for fresh food and great value."}
{"text":"This place is ok. Staff is very kind food was just ok. Had kabob meal meat was yummy rice was bland. Husband and kids had a gyro and they were decent."}
{"text":"Thank you Elie and staff at the Pita House!
I had lunch here today and enjoyed the mix plate with rice and hummus with freshly made in house pita bread.
Love the option of indoor and outdoor seating. Parking not a problem, friendly customer service and quick turn around on getting my meal. Prices are reasonable making this an option for another looking for good food and not breaking the bank.
They are very busy and I can see they.
If you're ever on this side of the city, stop and have a meal here!
I'm a fan!

{"text":"This is one of the few places to eat in Las Vegas that would survive in San Francisco.  Anyone coming from a city with good food knows that in general Las Vegas pretty much is the worst city in the world for decent food that isn't ridiculously expensive.  Pita House is one of the few places to eat that defies that.  

Pretty good food, would be 4 stars, but being here in Las Vegas, a city devoid of decent eats, gets a bonus star!"}
{"text":"Don't bother calling to try to order, they will just answer, then set the phone down. Then it's busy for hours. They must not need the business."}
{"text":"Wow... this place is amazing! They make all the food on site and everything is fresh.  We ordered the vegan platter and wrap and it was perfect! Took me back to my familys home cooking.  The owner or manager is very sweet and kind!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at The Pita House on several occasions over the years. Each time I go back, I'm reminded why I haven't been back sooner. It isn't terrible, but it isn't very good either. The food I've had here has generally been bland. All the right ingredients are on the plate, but nothing stands out, and nothing brings those ingredients together.

This time I had the gyro salad. The meat was just ok. The lettuce was crisp. The dressing was just boring. I have never gotten the sense that anyone who works here cares."}
{"text":"Food is amazing, huge variety of hookah flavors to choose from, live belly dancers, and cheap drinks! Fell in love with this place instantly. Owner Rashad is very nice, other guys that hang around there are kind of creepy but hey anywhere that serves booze that's expected!"}
{"text":"The place looks clean food is good but not wow....the hummus not the original one .I loved the most the samusa,shawarma chicken was a little dry but overall if you around worth a visit ."}
{"text":"Confusing place. Walked it to what appeared to be a loungy restaurant with hookahs. A few people looked up at me, i asked if this was the pita place and one said yes.  I asked how do i order food and was told id need to go to the next door around the corner. Went in, ordered, a little pricey but i figured it would be good. Told her a few times that id never been there- cue to welcome a new customer and educate me... nothing. Told the girl id be eating in the lounge. When she brought me my food it was in a to-go bag. Pita was tiny  compared to what im used to, tasted fine, but no reason to go back. Oh well."}
{"text":"Touristy location on the NE corner of Scottsdale & 1st.  They have expanded their seating with the outdoor area and taking over the adjacent place which I thought was an old coffee house called Jamaica something or other.  Anyway, service was fair, food was good, and prices were a bit mixed - some items seemed priced about normal but others were a couple bucks high.  

Don't care for their no-substitution policy since they do their entrees and sandwiches a little different than most other falafel places."}
{"text":"Was charged an extra 3% because I used a credit card. Was not told this beforehand. Be aware they will sneak this charge in.

Counter is cluttered, a table had a laptop and paperwork scattered everywhere. 

Not ready for primetime."}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time today and OMG their food is so tasty! I'm super happy that I no longer have to drive to la anymore to get that awesome garlic sauce! I don't think there's any other restaurant in Las Vegas that sells it! Simply amazing!"}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE THIS PLACE!  We always have such a great time!  They have amazing hummus, gyros and tabbouleh, but our favorite thing about the Pita House is dancing to the beats created by Gilbert, the most amazing DJ we've ever heard!  We are truly amazed by his talent and passion for music.  We love to dance and he always plays one of our favorite songs for us.  Hookah is really fun too!  They also have a nice patio.  We consider ourselves regulars now and we appreciate the wonderful service we've always received. We will return next Friday, and the next Friday, and the next Friday... :)"}
{"text":"The place has a nice atmosphere, inside and outside seating. One draw: no beer on tap. We tried the babaghanouj with the pita bread as an appetizer and it was good
But nothing crazy. Service is really slow so expect to wait a good 20 min for your food, but the wait is worth it. I had the combo plate that has beef and chicken kabob
And kafta with rice and it was delicious. It is also open until 2 am including the kitchen so it's perfect for a late dinner when other places are already closed. Overall great experience."}
{"text":"Incredible gyros & the hummus is served in a large portion. Yummy! My husband is very picky about his tzatziki sauce & theirs was wonderful. The pita bread was soft, warm & very fresh."}
{"text":"A friend brought me here thinking since I was such a huge fan of Greek/Mediterranean food and Pita Jungle that I would love it.

Wrong.

The location is godawful.  By location I mean, on my visit we were seated outdoors and ash from a hookah lounge kept flying into my eyes and mouth.  I am not even sure if that hookah lounge is still there or not... but if it is... don't sit outdoors at Pita House.  The lounge was not even open while I was there, but the hookahs were outside and the wind just blows that stuff around.  

The food was just meh.  And the service was subpar.  I ordered a chicken pita and fries and it took an awfully long time.  The fries were sogggggggy.

I won't return, even with all the coupons I see floating around for this place.  I cannot in good conscience give this place a do-over."}
{"text":"Pita House has been my local favorite since moving to the south end of Las Vegas in 2014.  Yesterday, with very little notice, Pita House went all-out for the Christ Church EfM class.  Lots of happy people!"}
{"text":"Let's just put it this way I wish Yelp had negative stars lol this place had horrible service, not good hookah  I think I knew more about hookah they did."}
