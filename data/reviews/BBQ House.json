{"text":"We just finished eating here with our friends and everything was great. The meat was good. Steam egg and Korean miso paste soup was good and service was very good. I think out of all the all you can eat places this is the best Korean BBQ place in Arizona."}
{"text":"Quick tip:   They will not let you dine by yourself.  Must have two or more guests!  First time for everything!!"}
{"text":"The quality of the meat was good. The overall ambiance was nice. It is a little cramped and the staff can get busy, but this is a nice place."}
{"text":"I went by myself for lunch and was turned away.  Hostess said they don't serve singles, just groups of two or more.  Is that typical of Korean BBQ joints?"}
{"text":"I will admit, we walked through the back door, unaware because there was no clear sign for entry. We were sat immediately but although our table was set, it still needed to be wiped. 

The food
The food was good. The boneless galbi was probably my favorite new find. Both bulgogis that we had tried were good. But I do wish that the pork belly, had less pork and more belly. 

The service
Although the table needed to be rewiped, the service is good. They cleaned the table immediately before placing any plates of sides down, and our server continuously came to check on us. She would fill our drinks without asking and ask us if we would like to order more food often. 

The atmosphere
The vibe is alright. Probably not my favorite. The tables have rectangular grills and the vents come down from the ceiling.. which I'm not a fan of. 

Overall, the food is edible, the service is okay, our server was good, and there was no wait. I'd say this place comes in second out of the three all you can eat kbbq places I've tried thus far here in AZ."}
{"text":"It wasn't like other Korean BBQ that I have had. The food is horrible and expensive!! I didn't like the grill being in the middle of my table and I'm the one cooking my own food...I can cook at home."}
{"text":"Food is amazing but interesting how we ordered beverages and it takes them over 40 min to bring our sodas.. rice is still cooking in the back where 3 out 9 people in our party were given rice..then we ordered soup but they're out of spoons. The food was good but everything just took way too long."}
{"text":"It's a bad place. We were sit for10mins and nobody service us. It's a lot of smoke inside and makes my daughter crying all the time. I will never come back."}
{"text":"It is my 1st time I like the food. But the service it takes forever. We wait for 20min waiting for someone to get r payment. And they forgot r rice we finished already r 1st order and still no rice."}
{"text":"Excellent value for lunch! All you can eat and you can choose what you want. You don't have to have all the same options. We walked in and were sat right away. Immediately sides and salad were brought to the table. #1,6 and 10 are highly recommended. Everything was so savory! Don't forget the cinnamon pineapple for dessert."}
{"text":"This was our first visit after passing by and seeing the \"open soon\" sign. We concur with the 4&5 star reviews. Great food, friendly service made it worthwhile. Wife is a fussy eater and she liked it. She did not eat much pork belly which was the least favorite thing we had. We highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Very average Korean BBQ. The portions sizes were good. The seasoning and marinades were bland.  There are much better options within a short drive. The service was kind if miserable. We ordered 4 dishes between 4 people to start and the server rushed to dump them all on the grill at one time. To me bbq is a social think and isn't meant to be rushed."}
{"text":"Can't knock the people, or the food itself except the cinnamon pineapple. Really loud place, fast paced environment. 95or more % protein. Veggies were skimpy. The hurried pace, the volume and the cost ($100+ for 3) have me saying One and Done. Especially when less than 2 miles away there's a superior Korean experience that has made me very happy over and over. For less than 1/2 the price point."}
{"text":"We had such an awesome time here.  I can especially recommend the house bulgolgi and the galbi.  After her first recommendation was delicious, we let our server Sunny pick out the rest of our orders.  She was excellent and so was the food.  We finished with sweet cinnamon spiced pineapple rings grilled in a foil packet.

The way it works: everyone who is seated will be charged the per person price ($23 if you stick to the standard items, $27 if you get one or more of the premium items).  Every meal comes with traditional Korean cold dishes to share.  Then you order three items off the menu as a group and the server grills them up in front of you.  Chow down.  When everyone is ready you can order three more items.  Repeat as often as you like four up to two hours.)  No doggie bags and you get charged $7 extra if you have wastes food at the end."}
{"text":"My first Korean BBQ experience. All in all it was tasty and I love the whole concept. 
Here the service was what was lacking. Our waitress was an elderly woman who may have been related to the owner. I'm not sure. But she was NOT a customer service expert. I don't want to speak ill of the elderly, so let's just say the bill showed up after our first round (20 min in). For the price, ha! We stayed for quite a few more rounds. 
Fortunately some of the staff took note of our plight and has mercy on us. They kept the food coming and were very accommodating, including who appeared to me the owner. Overall it was a cool place with good eats. The service, I'm sure they will work on."}
{"text":"We tried this place last night. Thought it was excellent and will come back.  No issues as commented in some of the other reviews.  JGH"}
{"text":"I like the food here, I definitely recommend number 18, the Boneless Galbi. Their bulgogi is also amazing.

I'm just a little upset because twice we ordered and the food never came, we had to re-order. 
And our waitress had a habit of quickly walking away after every order.

BRING CASH - DON'T USE CARD HERE
At the end she wouldn't split the bill for me and my friends, she did some bad math for us and a few of us ended up over paying. We should have calculated before handing her our cards. Out of what my card was charged, she got a fat $12 tip from me. I hope she spends it wisely because I don't think she deserved more than $5 for that ordeal.

Other than that I would definitely return and I would recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"This place is close to my house. Went there today with some friends and it was good. It's priced higher then Gen Korean BBQ.  Gen has one price not a premium & regular. They should think about having one price. Gen Korean is 25 bucks on weekends for everything on their menu & it's better. I will go again for sure, but they need bigger shrimp. You couldn't separate it from the shell do to it being so very small. Oh and insist on cooking your own food. So in closing they are over priced and it's not as good as Gen Korean BBQ. But good enough to go again one day."}
{"text":"TLDR: Come here for quantity of food, not quality 

Been here a few times now. Now that the initial fascination with this new place has worn off, I realize there's better KBBQ places in town. If you want to go to a place for a quantity of food, this place is your jam. There's still no official \"rule\" as to how much meat you can order. Last time I was here they said each person in our party of 5 could order two meats each round. It has since been changed to 1 per person each round. So to get the best quantity, it's better to come here with larger parties.

Quality of the meat is what's lacking compared to the other kbbq places. The brisket comes out frozen, so it tends to dry out really fast when it's cooked, and there's just not that much flavor even when you cook it more on the rare side. 

Another thing that I talked about last time, and still don't like, is the splashing of the meat juices. The tray under the table still has a gap, so if you have shorts on, be prepared to get some hot oils or juices on your legs. And same with the grill, it's raised a little bit higher than the table, whereas most places have the grill at the same level if not sunken it a bit. Because of their design, you're more likely to get something hot splash on you. 

The plus side here is that there's generally no wait, but thats probably indicative of something..."}
{"text":"Great food, but service is awful. Hopefully there will.be some staff turnover, and I am willing to return to try again! Servers would continually bring the wrong (and less expensive) cuts of meat."}
{"text":"Dont get me wrong food and environment are good. But if you do go there, bring someone Korean or someone who knows how to cook the food. I had no idea what I was doing so I didnt know if I was going to over cook it and take out all of the flavor or under cook it and get food poisoning. My only complaint, has the potential to be awesome"}
{"text":"Awesome eats everything absolutely fresh and yummy delicious food must try great food and atmosphere!! Waiter Steven absolutely the chillest dude so helpful and nice  completely in love with this food !!!"}
{"text":"A few years ago, BBQ House would've been a major addition to the area, but the recent boom in the AYCE Korean BBQ scene around the valley has put it into a solid middle-of-the-road option instead. I think that BBQ House's meat quality is a step below the others, both in tenderness and flavor. The restaurant is large and spaced pretty well, but the ventilation is really bad. If you come here, you'll need to take a shower after to get rid of the smoke in your hair and on your clothes. In spite of that, I like the grill set-up here - the fire is closer to the grill and the grill itself is sloped to allow for drainage. The menu has a pretty good array of options regardless of which one you opt for. Service is pretty prompt but some things can get lost as the restaurant gets busier. Would probably be a good option for larger parties, but for a smaller group it wouldn't be at the top of my list."}
{"text":"The meat and sides are on par, if not better, than many places I've tried throughout California. The meats are tender and sliced well while the sides (cheese corn and egg hot pots are both great) are just as good.

The service is slower due to a lack of staff (just opened 5 or so days ago), but I feel like after the opening growing pains this will be a big addition to the community."}
{"text":"We tried this place on a Saturday night,  so we expected that it would be pretty busy.  What we weren't prepared for was the extreme lack of service. 

We got seated rather quickly for it being a packed house, but the table was NOT cleaned or new plates set. Also there was a \"clean\" grill that had what looked to be rare meat juice on it.  We had to ask another waiter to switch it out since the one who took our order didn't even notice.

You are allowed 4 meat dishes per round and they come out quickly when we were actually able to get an order in.
Had to constantly wait and ask for items that were missing such as dipping sauce, napkins, tongs, scissors.

I wouldn't recommend getting the premium group ($28) unless you really like the buckwheat noodles because 2 of the 3 meat dishes on the list are limited."}
{"text":"Went there tonight for dinner and it was absolutely amazing! The food was great and the service was even better! Carlos did an amazing job and was on point the entire night, we probably asked for a million different things and he happily fulfilled each one of our requests. When you come in definitely request him as your server!"}
{"text":"Loved that you can call ahead to \"skip the wait\"+++

My family and I tried this Korean BBQ restaurant for the first time and guarantee it will not be the last. Service was fast and premium menu selections were very tasty. I was able to try the Cold Buckwheat Noodles (Naengmyeon) for the first time and boy was I impressed! The broth was nicely cool and crisp. Everything I would have imagined this dish to taste and more!
The side dishes were also really good. Loved their regular kimchi and their cucumber kimchi as well. 

Make sure you go there as your last stop of the day or take a second set of clothes to change to after, because you'll come out smelling like delicious food"}
{"text":"We've made it a mission to try out all the kbbqs around us and we finally made it to this location. 

It was Sunday evening and it surprisingly wasn't too busy when we arrived. An older lady was manning the front and she greeted us when we walked in. She then had another employee walk us over to our table. 

She left us with the menus and right away our server made it over. Our server was super friendly but we only saw him about 3 times out of the 162638944 times that we were helped. We had the older lady help us and a few other employees as well made it to our table. 

We were seated in a booth right next to a window and it was super hot. We had the grill going full force and the sun beaming in our window, so it felt like we were in an oven. We were seated right under the thermostat and it read it was at 80 degrees, omg! Not sure how accurate that thermostat was, but this place was HOT. 

The meats were good but the portions we got were small. The steamed egg came at us boiling hot and it tasted pretty good. 

They don't do a side of lettuce but they do give you a salad. We paid about $25 each for the regular option, and it does come with a selection of different dishes. 

The employees were friendly and the place was clean. They have several different sizes of tables and booths and they can serve big parties. 

Our bill came out to be about $82 for three regular kbbqs and two drinks and a water. 

We will be back in he future maybe once it cools down or when I decide to buy my portable air conditioner to bring in with me."}
{"text":"Craving some KBBQ today.  So here we are, giving this mum + pop shoppe a go. ^_^

Lunch hour is 16.99 per person (open til 3p.)
2 hour limit (standard time limit)
All you can eat but drinks not included 

We were seated promptly.
Loads of parking space.
No waiting.
They accept reservations.

Our server was somewhat attentive. It was only 2 table -- ours, and another family.

It was rather odd to us that our server wanted to cook our meal for us.  Haven't experienced that in any AYCE KBBQ joints.

Noodle dish, jap chae (?), was bland, cold, overcooked.

Another odd thing, the server and a cook came by out of nowhere. The cook lifted the grill while our food was still cooking, and the server poured water in the grill...without a warning or explanation. 

We exited smelling like food. 

Overall, our experience was ok to eh. For the price, we expected a little more than the service and food we received.

If this spot is working for you... That's brilliant!

But for us, not so much."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of the better kbbq around. My brother, brother in law and dad all love kbbq.  This place hits the spot! Our waitress, Sunny was wonderful, very cheerful and helpful.  The meat great quality and the marinades are awesome too. Be sure to check them out."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this restaraunt's policy of not seating a single diner Fri thru Sun....found this out when I stopped by for dinner tonight. I won't be coming back even when I'm not dining solo.  Fortunately, there are other gret options."}
{"text":"Recently new to the Dobson Ranch area, BBQ House is a good place for an all you can eat lunch or dinner option, so come hungry and be prepared to eat everything you order or they'll charge you $7 for left over food. I saw the review about legs getting burned by the cooker and I could see that happening for someone with long legs or really tall. But I'm short and had no problem. I like how there are multiple table arrangements so I could bring my pescatarian mom and the food wouldn't touch. They have a few veggie and shrimp options as well. Come hungry and leave happy."}
{"text":"This place fucking sucks!! The food was nasty as hell and the lady didn't explain what anything was. She tried to charge me for food I didn't eat. This place is just absolutely terrible so don't fucking go!!!!! And the bitch literally made us tip with her ugly ass"}
{"text":"So I've been watching this new place move in since summer. So... for me and my husband we couldn't wait to try this new place.... and now we have!   This is a sampler's paradise. Per person it was $22.99 And they have a premium menu that includes beef short rib, top sirloin, and beef chuck flap tail for $27.99. 

So our first experience included: (Extra comments are added to my favorites)
6 Angus Prime
7 Beef Bulgogi
9 Pork Loin
10  Sesame marinated beef
14 Beef rib finger meat (excellent, juicy and thick)
16 Beef Tongue (great flavor)
17 Marinated Pork Chop
25  Cajun spicy chicken bolgogi (Yes, it's spicy)
27  Cajun spicy shrimp
22  Chicken bolgogi
30 Spicy baby octopus
31 Cinnamon sugar pineapple
39 Corn cheese

The meal includes sample plates of salad, potato salad,  Kimchi, cumber salad and a few other little tasty foods to try.  If you love to sample a lot, a little at a time, this is a great place to visit. Especially if you are  looking for a protein healthy place. I thought it was great. I have never tried beef tongue- fantastic flavor. And their Cajun dishes were good too. They will give you refills on any salad dish (I loved using the cucumber sauce as a sauce for my meats).  Over all a well worth trip and worth the money. Come hungry!! 

Christine is the manger and owner and she was great. I needed an accommodation and she was very thoughtful and accommodating - I sometimes have special need issues. If you need one, ask for Christine before seating and she will come and talk to you."}
{"text":"I thought this place was never going to open.  For months they teased us with a sign that they were going to open soon.  Well I can say it was worth the wait.  

As expected the lunch menu is smaller then the dinner but that should not stop you from coming here during lunch.  The basics are there so that's all that matters.  

They are still going through some open pains, they could have used at least one more person waiting tables.  I noticed service was more attentive first half and got slower as the place got busier.  One more server would have helped.

Overall the meat tasted good, probably ate more then I should have since I had to go back to work.

Not sure what more I can add here.. food was good, for now give yourself extra tme for lunch.  Hopefully they will get the extra help soon.

It's worth a try, especially since they have some side menu options others don't have"}
{"text":"A fourth AYCE Korean bbq place in town? Yes please!  I was pleasantly surprised when I walked into a large, clean restaurant.  It was not very busy on a Thursday night. Usually, busier makes me think better but with the insane crowds at Gen and now even Manna, I was relieved to have space, great service, and not suffocated by smoke. Not sure how busy it gets on weekends though.  We chose to do the lower tier for $22.99 and it is the best bang for your buck of the 4 AYCE kbbq places.  It essentially includes everything you want including beef tongue which is always on the premium tier at other places. We were very happy with our multiple orders of beef tongue, beef belly, beef brisket, and spicy octopus.  Meat quality is decent and they change your grill often.  The downsides are that their side dishes are nothing great.  Lack of radish wrap saddens me.  I would need to try the premium tier to truly compare this place to the others.  I think Manna still remains my fave.  But with the great price, I would come here or Manna over Gen or Gangnam any day."}
{"text":"After much anticipation this place is finally open. There is a wide variety to choose from and the quality is superb. The service was great. Love it!"}
{"text":"They need to change their hours and serve people when they say they are open .. came in an hour before they closed.. Korean lady in front said they were still open but someone from the back came out and said they stopped serving food and refused to seat us. First, and last time there."}
{"text":"Unbelievable. Great Korean BBQ. I have been to many places and the food here is better than average. All you can eat is an amazing deal."}
{"text":"My husband went here for an early dinner and had the best time. Sunny was our server and she helped us cook our food and explained the best ways to cook it. Usually, other places would just let us cook it and I guess let us overcook our meats, but Sunny was so funny and made it clear that she really cares about our experience. I saw she did this with all the guests that were also there and I thought that was really great to see.

Food: The meats were so good. We got the regular menu and just got beef tongue, galbi, pork chops, pork belly --- but next time we'll get the Premium menu and get steak added on. The sides were great also! 

We'll be coming back and this will be the only KBBQ place in AZ we'll be supporting"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good! You can only order 4 items at one time. The servings were small so I had to constantly keep ordering. Service was a little slow, but they did seem pretty busy that night. The servers were all attentive and willing to quickly fulfill requests. Overall, a positive first time experience."}
{"text":"Service was great, bless the server who was SUPER patient with our table full of indecisive women who didn't know what they wanted to eat. The ice cream macaroon sandwich for dessert was DELISH!"}
{"text":"What a great place fun fun fun 
RULES- all you can eat with a 2 hour limit 
The price changes if you are under 40\" and higher if you are under 60\" haha(see menu)
You cook at your table and they keep bringing you seasoned meat 
The food is TASTY  
IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A FUN MEAL THAT TASTES GREAT GO HERE (look at pictures)"}
{"text":"So good!   I've been waiting to try this place since it opened.  Sorry it took me so long.  Tried a bit of everything and there wasn't anything we didn't like.  Bulgogi was definitely my favorite.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Kinda expensive for kinda bland meat. 
Meat isn't very tender either. 
Would not come back"}
{"text":"Delicious food and the customer service was amazing!!! The people next to us hadn't had Korean BBQ before so I listened in as their server helped them with recommendations, teach them how to cook the food, etc."}
{"text":"Most amazing place... All you can eat Korean BBQ for $23.00 what more needs to be said. Spicy pork belly and Bulgogi top the list but let's not forget the spicy calamari."}
{"text":"AWESOME!!!! one of the best Korean BBQ's I have been to in Arizona."}
{"text":"Great place to go with friends. Excellent food and really good service. Shout out to our waiter Carlos for being so nice and patience with us even though it was really busy. Definitely 100% recommend."}
{"text":"The customer service made the food even better. Sunny was our server and she's the best! I recommend anyone from the area to come here than any other Kbbq's. Don't forget to ask for Sunny as your server!"}
{"text":"I went here not knowing anything about it and the moment we walked in the door the food smelled amazing. When we were seated is when I realized we can cook our own food right at the table. How fun!  After cooking up some stuff, we found it to taste AMAZING!  It was a bit pricy for 3 of us but I don't mind when it is that good.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Ahhhhhhh! So good! Like amazingly good.  If you like meat in your mouth this is the place to be.  Staff was superb!"}
{"text":"Such a disappointment. I was sooo excited this place finally opened. First, the food is just okay nothing special.  Second, our service was terrible !! They really need to train them better. Sorry but we won't be back"}
{"text":"Had lunch here again with the family and am still very happy and full with it. The only change was ordering this time the host/waitress only let us order one item per person to start off. She said just to start and so can enjoy the food and can get more later. It was fine us, the food was good portions and tasted great. After we were about done with the first round, she came back to ask what else we wanted and changed out the grill for us too. We had our fill after the second round and was plenty happy. I'm sure their more structured ordering process is to ensure there isn't any wasted food because there is extra cost if not finished food is left. They still have the same 2hr eating limit but that is plenty of time. I don't understand the reviews complaining about the process there since it is about the same as any other Korean bbq ayce. The only change from first visit to latest visit is the order 1 item per person, but it was plenty of food to cook on grill and you can get more when your done. I think they got complaints from people not understanding that if you don't finish you are charged for extra wasted food. Which is understandable since they pay for great quality meats and can't take it back. You get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"It's kind of a 3.5 star but I'll round up to a 4 because the owner???? or whoever the old lady was... was really nice. She joked around with us and made sure we enjoyed ourselves. She talked with us about the Korean beer we were ordering.

As for the food, I love that they have the egg dish. Gen at Tempe Marketplace (my number 1 spot) doesn't serve the egg dish. I feel like the quality of meat is good but not up to Gen quality. In addition to that, I feel that the staff was almost non-existent at times. It was hard to reorder food. Our grill was changed whenever we asked so that was not a problem!

You do get a lot of food for each order. I loved the Galbi the best. The beef tongue was also amazing. However, the brisket I had was just ok... didn't really like the dryness. 

I would have to say, it is cheaper than Gen so if you're cost conscious, this is the place. It's just a dollar more than Manna, and you get Galbi here! I think the selection at BBQ house is better than Manna's in general. 

If you are splitting a check, they will split equally among everyone. So... make sure everyone orders the same thing if you need the check split."}
{"text":"First of all, I apologize for the graphic photos, however, they are relevant to the post.  

Food was above average.  I don't eat Korean barbecue often, but this place was better than most I've been to.  My party didn't wait long for our food.  The dishes they had are common in most other Korean barbecue establishments.  Also, I ordered the normal meat selections, not the premium one.  

Service was probably the best I've ever received at any Korean barbecue restaurant.  Server was attentive, personable, but not annoying.  It seemed that he would always check on us right when we needed him.

The restaurant wasn't busy overall, therefore we never waited too long for food.  The price was cheaper than any other Korean barbecue restaurant I've been to.  Overall, I would probably give this place a 4 or 4.5 out of 5.  The reason why I gave this place 1 star and would highly recommend no one should ever eat here is because of the serious burns I received just above my kneecap.  The burner in which the meat is cooked on is not covered (under the table).  When I accidentally bumped my leg against the bottom of the table, it touched the grill for less than one second and I received burns on my leg (which you can view in the photos below); and it appears that the burn will leave permanent scarring and discoloration.  This unfortunately ruined my entire dining experience.  I will not return to this restaurant until this safety issue is addressed; which is extremely disappointing considering I was very much enjoying my meal up until that point.  Please fix this issue, so no one else has to endure this stressful experience."}
{"text":"At first I was a bit skeptical about coming here because the reviews aren't too great. But I live close so I figured I'd give it a try.

Had dinner here on a Friday night around 6:30pm. Place wasn't too crowded yet. Typical KBBQ with your side dishes. They limit you on ordering one item per guest at the table each time. We had 4 people so we could only order 4 things at a time.

An older lady checked up on us regularly - filling our waters and helping us cook out meats. We did place the meat on the grill ourselves as well but she was helpful when she came to our table. We also got a grill change twice.

I usually judge a KBBQ by their brisket quality and TBH, it wasn't very good here. HOWEVER, their bulgogi was amazingggg. Also love the fact that their beef tongue is on the regular menu and not the premium. Other meats worth getting is their pork belly and galbi. Their portion sizes are also pretty good."}
{"text":"Just opened. Friendly staff. Good portions per order. Menu is worded incorrectly tho so beware."}
{"text":"Finally! This place is open!!! I came here on a Thursday night to check it out. It wasn't busy at all so I was seated immediately. As dinner progressed, more people came and at its busiest, the restaurant was about half full. I anticipate it becoming busier as time progresses and more people are aware of it. 

The restaurant is completely remodeled and has a very trendy interior. It is clean, and there is a lot of space between tables. The grill is metal and located at the center of the table. It's rectangle, roughly 24\"x18\". Again, a severe gross estimation. It's on the smaller side, but the food cooks quickly so it's really not an issue. Plus, it helps to pace the eating. There is a cylindrical hood above the grill, is slightly intrusive, but it is adjustable so not entirely a huge deal. 

It is AYCE, and there is a separate lunch menu. The dinner menu has two separate dining options: premium $27.99 and regular $22.99. The only difference is access to five different food options. I've attached the menu for viewing if you're curious.  They have a lot of options, and the food itself was pretty good! I would prefer if the meats were more lean, but it's not a deterrent for me. It would be good to have some veggie offerings too. Of note, they do have octopus, and it was really good! The meats were sliced very thin and cooked very quickly. They do serve alcohol as well. 

All the servers were extremely nice and helpful. They checked on our table a bunch of times, and they brought our order out almost immediately after we ordered. I was impressed. The only downside was that it was pretty obvious this was a new restaurant, and the servers haven't yet found their groove. I was happy with the service and am eager to see how they improve as time progresses."}
{"text":"Third time here. 
I enjoy this place, good food. 
Portions are a good size, they allow 5 dishes at a time."}
{"text":"I was awaiting for this place to open for the past year in half and alas it has opened! I was so excited to try this place out on there second day opening that I wish I should have waited. It was a less than desirable experience as they had less choices of ban Chan and meat available (i.e. no fish cakes, or intestines). The meat quality was average, you often had to get the waitress attention as they  forget what you ordered (makes you look hungrier than you actually are! Lol). The only upside about my experience was there was no wait at all unlike the other Korean bbq restaurants here in the valley *ahem 2 hr wait at Gen. Will definitely give this place another try as it has promise and also the fact that it is only 0.5 mile away from where I live. Excited that AZ is diversifying itself in Korean bbq that before was only available in California."}
{"text":"The plan was to go to Cornish Pasty but decided to give this new place a try.  You're definitely paying $28 pet person for the experience. Our server was a Korean lady who didn't have much personality, nor did she give us any direction of what to expect or how this place works.  The additional help staff was nice, suggested other things to order,  refilled drinks,  Etc.  They brought out a salad and 6 little plates of different sides,  if you liked those you can order more.  We ordered spicy chicken, marinated sesame ribs, top sirloin,  brisket...all were good,  but not exceptional. I feel you're paying for the experience. I'm glad we tried it, but don't feel the need to come back or refer friends to this place."}
{"text":"** BBQ House is a Stellar Experience! Don't miss out! **

Tonight's Hungry Homie Club consisted of me, Todd and Mitchell.   We were originally headed out to a different Korean restaurant one block North of BBQ House. For the curious, its initials are DT. 

Unbeknownst to us, but fortunate for our trio, DT was having a \"Private Party\" from 7 pm to 11 pm. So, no dice at the DT. And to let the end result out of the bag: Todd and Mitchell, DT veterans, said BBQ House is far superior to DT.

So we headed to BBQ House and AMAZING began to unfold. We greeted at the door with a nice smile and seated in a nice corner spot. The restaurant was clean and nicely lit. Our server was pleasant and seemed to immediately appear from nowhere whenever we needed anything. She gave helpful advice on cooking, helped load the grill, cut the meat... WOW, she was on point and pure AWESOME. She also monitored the grill and had it swapped out 3 times during the course of our 90 minute meal.

We ordered drinks, a couple beers and a water. We ordered the premium AYCE. It exceeded expectations in every way. 

The Ban Chan appis were tasty and refreshing. I love kimchi. Both the regular napa and the cucumber kimchis were stellar. We reordered them twice. 

We ordered the following (Using a 1-5 Star Rating):
  Rice (Hey, it's a staple and was all I hoped it would be)
  Spicy Pork Bulgogi (did this one twice) ***** Amazing flavor!
  Marinated Signature Beef Bulgogi ***** Ditto
  Boneless Beef Short Rib Filet ****
  Top Sirloin Steak ****
  Angus Prime Thin Sliced Brisket ****
  Marinated Beef Rib Finger Meat ***
  Premium Spicy Pork Belly (twice as well) ****
  Spicy chicken Bulgogi ****
  Beef Chuck Flap Tail ***
  Cajun Spicy Shrimp ** (Comes w/shell on, and is a pain to shell)

Folks, it was all good, much was bordering the spectacular. We are all headed back again soon.

Things on my list for next time:
  Cinnamon Sugar Pineapple
  Seasonal Vegetables for Grill

Can't believe I missed them.

These types of venues are relaxing and fun. Be sure to head out with someone you love to be with. 

Enjoy."}
{"text":"As a former Northern Virginia Resident and well accustomed to Korean BBQ, I never thought I will find a Korean bbq in 100 degree cactus infested Arizona! Well... yeoboseyo ninjas! This place reminded me of back home 

BBQ House is an all you eat Korean bbq! Came here to celebrate bro in laws bday and what a perfect pick. We came around 2 on a Sunday and perfect time!

They give you a menu to choose from either choose from the premium meats or the standard. We chose the standard coz we weren't really interested in the premium meats they offered. 

We basically stuck with bulgogi (marinated meat), brisket, pork belly, kimchi, japchae, and even tried the intestine because ... YOLO! 

Customer service was great! Our waitress was very attentive and very nice! She was on top of her game  and always making sure that we are always stuffing our face. Even surprised my little girl with chocolate. I allowed it because it's early-- i would slap it out of her hand otherwise. 

Food was impressive compared to  back home. See we used to live in Korea town back home so you know there were unlimited selections and varieties of Korean bbq restaurants and BBQ HOUSE held its own. Bravo! They offered so many selections of beef and side dishes which was impressive! If preferred, they even give you a big plate of a side dish (ban Chan) if you request it. It'll even help the waitress from going back and forth! 

The place is spacious! I can definitely see it getting packed during peak hours so make your reservations if you don't want to wait a long time. 

Verdict: we will be back... without a toddler next time. It got pretty hot and Smokey in our area so it's not ideal for us to bring her with us next time. It's also because she threw a tantrum lol"}
{"text":"This was such a fun experience !  Staff is friendly and knowledgeable. We ordered squid, pork belly, bul go gi and galbi.  They set 6 sides/ pickles to enjoy along with 2 sauces. We also had jap chae , rice, corn with cheese, salad, and grilled pineapple with cinnamon.  Everything was delicious! This is a great place to get your Korean fix!  Reasonable prices for the amount and quality of food."}
{"text":"First time in Phoenix and our family decided to try this place out! They have wonderful customer service, they will definitely cook for you and they will give you the best recommendations on their meat choices! The best part about this place is Sunny's service, she works extremely hard and always checks on you if you need anything else. She was also able to give directions of places to visit! I will definitely go here again, when I visit Phoenix! Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"My friends raved about BBQ House, so we decided to give it a go. The outside it well lit and welcoming. The interior was clean and spacious. The menu choices seemed pretty good, and I appreciated a larger flat grill. I wasn't a huge fan of the hang-down hood, because it blocked us from seeing across the table at each other, but it did the job. We came at around 8, so it was a little slower, and wasn't as smoky as I have read about in other reviews.
We had 5 of us, and were told that we could o my pick 5 things at a time. The meat selections were fairly large, so I get it. 
The bulgogi beef was really great. And I'm not a beef person. It was well-flavored and tenderized. My husband really enjoyed everything, but I was underwhelmed. The salad was just ok. Lettuce with a few carrot shreds and some dull ginger dressing. The glass noodle was just noodle with some sesame oil. The kimchi was in large chunks, but marinated, and very hard. I also wasn't a fan of the pickled jicama nor the cucumber. My friend was in love with the potato salad. 
I enjoyed the squid, although the portions were really small. The shrimp were a hot mess. They were uncleaned, head on shrimp, with 12 inch long whiskers. They didn't marinate well because they were essentially sealed, and they were bs to eat with just chopsticks. The cinnamon sugar pineapple was a joke. The order included two baby canned pineapple rings with cinnamon. No sugar. 
Our drinks and rice bowls were never empty,  but that's pretty much where our service stopped. We had to beg for grill changes and waited forever staring at each other to order stuff when we ran out of meat. The shrimp was forgotten, but some rice soup showed up that nobody ordered. My friend said that it tasted like burnt rice, and made her think of when she was a kid and had no food in the Philippines. Turned us right off. The coup de grâce was having one of the servers spill the salad all over my purse, the chair, and the floor. No one cleaned it up for like an hour. 
While others seemed very happy with the BBQ House, I wasn't impressed, and wont go back by choice (my hubby may make me. We'll see.)"}
{"text":"This place isn't my favorite. Food is alright. Kinda expensive for bland meats. Service can be better. Overall I would probably not come back."}
{"text":"Just like another reviewer, we have also been waiting for this place to open and it finally did! We ordered a few bulgogi meats, the marinated shrimp and the seasonal vegetables. The Angus prime brisket was the best we tried. However, the seasonal vegetables were not a good choice. It only contained half an onion, some mushrooms and some slices of zucchini. 

Everything else was great though. There were lots of side dishes as well. The price is fairly reasonable and the service was quite friendly so we will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Ordered 2 pork belly and a bean paste soup. Sangyupsal and daejeong Chigae. The side dishes were minimal. Had to request rice. They didn't have the lettuce wraps - Sanchu. They turned the grill up so high everything went from raw to burned in a minute. Had to request the bean paste, then they brought very little. Will not be going back. Don't mind spending money on a good meal, but $60 for crispy, burned bacon and rice will not get my return business."}
{"text":"The staff was very pleasurable and kind. Being new to this kind of dining, they were very receptive and tried to help us as we choose items and cooked new types of meat. It was a very fun experience and even though my mom was skeptical about cooking our own meals - she had a grand time trying out dishes she had never tried. It gave her a unique experience with foreign food!

The pineapple with cinnamon. That is one of the most delicious things - we had like 3 servings each we were so in love. If you GO get this for dessert. Let it heat a little and carmelize the stuff inside - YUM!"}
{"text":"Met a friend here for Dinner, at his suggestion.  This is a new restaurant in a long line of AYCE (All You Can Eat) Korean BBQ spots.  The basic selection is pretty good for the price and if you want to upgrade to the higher/premium level, you get an additional 6 items (approximately) to select from.  The serving sizes were very good, so you really didn't need to order a lot of items each time and everything was very well seasoned.  I would suggest that you offer an add on/ala carte version for some of the different noodle type dishes vs. including them in the premium level, like your lunch menu.  This was one of the reasons I could not give this place more than \"OK\" rating.  

The place, tables and seats appeared to be clean; however, the other reason, is that the ventilation system could use a little bit of an improvement, because the placed did smell a bit of old oil and the floors had a slightly slippery feel.

The customer service was very good, all of the staff was friendly and checked in regularly for more orders of food to be brought.  That was a nice thing.  I would definitely come back based on the service and amounts of food that come in the order.   Just remember, most, if not all of these places to have a maximum time allotted for dining in (2 hrs)."}
{"text":"We love this place, great food! Sunny is one of the best server we had when we first came here. Today We met a server name Carlos, he offer us new selections that we haven't tried before and also checked up on us to see how we're doing. GREAT SERVICE! They deserve a raise!
If anyone come to this place ask for Sunny or Carlos, they will know how to take care of you!"}
{"text":"Walked in with my roommate at 9PM on a Saturday night, they told me kitchen closes at 8:30PM and they essentially were closed. The dining room was basically empty besides one party. As someone who has worked in the restaurant industry for over ten years, I was kinda surprised. They are willingly turning away business because they more than likely don't want to clean and want to be out of the place by 11PM when they \"close\"..."}
{"text":"if I didn't already know how this all worked I would have been lost as our waitress didn't give us a run down. There is a 2 hours limit and you can order 2 items at a time per person.  Rice you must order separately. There was salt and pepper to season but no garlic oil or anything like that.  Pork belly was defrosted when we ordered it the first time the second time it was frozen. We went on a Sunday around noon it was slow but our service was slow."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. All you can eat for that price is a great bargain. Friendly wait staff and a great atmosphere. 

Just wish the shrimp wasn't peel and eat."}
{"text":"Great service and great food! The price was undeniably good for the amount that you eat which is as much as you want!!!  Be sure and ask for smaller portions if you want to sample the menu.  If you don't ask you get a full portion and it's huge!  You will no doubt only be able to eat 2 or maybe three choices.  

Servers are on it and will help you with any questions you may have on the menu if you have never had Korean BBQ before.  

Delicious!  I will be back!"}
{"text":"We have been back several times, and have never been disappointed.  Always have good service and great food, the bulgogi and kalbi are fantastic.  Last visit we brought friends from Korea and they raved about it.  Will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"First time in my life I get turn away from from a restaurant because I was alone and because they don't serve single people.. if that's not discrimination what is it? I walk in and they said we don't sit single people... they just open and I have been looking forward to try their food. Wow talking about discrimination against single people.  This is not over... they don't even deserve 1 star at this point. I will make sure everyone I know hears about what they did to me. Pure discrimination against single people.. disgusting.."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and the special was $16.99 all you can eat! the selection of meat was pretty good included pork, beef, chicken, squid, shrimp, and vegetables. at great tip that the waitress Sunny who was great by the way, she recommended that you put all the meat on the grill at once, it keeps the meat moist and cooks it evenly"}
{"text":"BBQ House was amazing! The ambience is so nice, I like it more than Manna and Gen,  also they have a few more options in sides!  ALSO the server was so nice and helpful.  Hands down best KBBQ"}
{"text":"My fiancé, son, and I came here for Valentine's Day. I'm so sorry about the late post. This restaurant is really big. 

I love all you can eat BBQ and this place has a lot of choices to choose from on their menu. The sides came out first, which is included in the all you can eat. They brought out potato salad, kimchee, cucumber kimchee, and bean sprouts. Also, the meat comes out in big portions. There is a lot of variety in the menu, even some items are tailored for children. My favorite item on the menu that most Korean BBQ places do not offer is beef belly. But this place has it, which is why we decided to try it.

The waiter was the best part of the experience. He was very attentive and friendly. He recommended some delicious stuff on the menu and brought out things he thought we would like. The soup that he recommended was also good. He was a Caucasian guy that was around 5' 9\" and was wearing glasses.


The reason why I rated this place a 4 star is because of the atmosphere. The speakers for the TV was too loud. Also, it was cold with no heaters. That's why you look forward to taking shelter in a restaurant as well, to have a comfortable climate to sit in."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful time, being served by such a welcoming staff, food was awesome and cooked to perfection on a grill that was changed out when ever it got to charred, can't wait to go back, thanks again Julee for taking away the fear of burning or eating uncooked food. Loved it and we well most definitely be telling friends and family to visit."}
{"text":"Great Korean bbq!! Great for families! 

Food: Delicious! We really enjoyed the meat selections and quality. Absolute MUST HAVE is the marinated boneless galbi, spicy squid, and sesame beef, you won't regret it!!

Service: Our waitress and her helpers did a good job. They made sure to change the grill, grab our next order, and refill sides. 

Ambiance: It was nice enough. Not ideal for romantic nights lol. 

Why 4 stars? We took 1 star away due to the tap water served, simple sides (no kimchi), and lack of ventilation. It was super smokey in there. 

TRY THIS PLACE OUT, be ready to take a good shower after. You'll smell like yummy bbq on the drive home."}
{"text":"*Review from Sunday afternoon lunch*
I haven't been here during a time when it's crowded or too busy. I don't like going to restaurants during peak times because my review would be clouded by slow service and chaos, so why put myself through that!?!

I think people confuse the word \"typical\" with mediocre. This is NOT mediocre Korean bbq, what is marinated is delicious, consistent and perfect every time! Cuts of meat are definitely premium (I've had good Korean flavor and bad cuts of meat, that to me is \"typical mediocre\" Korean BBQ. )

If you are a fan of Korean BBQ and a true fanatic, you're ordering beef belly, beef finger meat and pork jowl.

Great cuts of meat, clean environment and great customer service. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"This place is nice and quiet tucked away in the southeast corner of Dobson and Guadalupe. The place from the outside doesn't look too bad but hides how big the inside is. 

The servers there are actually nice as quick when it comes to ordering. The seating however is a little weird as I came in with my friend they decided to seat us next to two other people in a table space meant for a larger party instead of giving us just our own booth.

The grill is smaller than most places but cooks the food fast and great. Also with the adjustable smoker overhead you don't have to worry about smelling like korean bbq after you're done eating.

Food comes out quick and the presentation on the cuts of meat is nice. Also there is no limit to how much you can order at one time is nice but beware on over ordering because the grill is small so you can't cook everything at once.

Flavor of their marinade is subtle but has a great taste. Different from Gen but not bad just different. The cuts are plenty every time you order so the plates aren't skimpy. Didn't get a chance to try all of the menu just a little over half so I will definitely be here again."}
{"text":"My favorite Korea AYCE BBQ place in the valley now. Here is why:

Quality of meat: really great. My favorite was their thinly sliced brisket, rib finger meat (tender and the marinate was perfect/not too sweet), LA style rib without bones, and beef belly. I wasn't in the mood for pork or seafood tonight so I will have to come back for that later.

Service: super fast. Sunny, our waitress, was really nice and gave suggestions on what to order. She would come to us before we even thought of what to order next. I read something off the menu in Korean so she said wow you read Korean?  And then she spoke to me in Korean explaining about the best technique on how to grill and about the vent. Their other service people were nice too; changing the grill quickly after we grilled marinated meat that burns the grill.

Grill: I like this style of gril the best. It's angled and high in the middle and cooks more on the sides. The meat doesn't stick and there's no weird fuel taste. Looks like they have larger grill size for larger parties, but I'm not sure.

Price: We got the regular dinner which is $22.99 a person. Very great price. Seems like you can get cold noodles if you get the premium, but I didn't want that since we were not that hungry tonight.

Sides and other food: The banchan was very tasty and better than other restaurants I've been to. We ordered the cheese corn, which isn't a fancy dish, but the corn was sweet (like fresh off the cob) and we liked it. We ordered the steamed egg and the soybean paste soup which I loved. Their tteokbokki had a great taste too.  

Inside look: very open and spacious so you're not right next to another group. I like the casual look, kpop music playing, and the screens playing kpop music videos."}
{"text":"My daughter and I have been waiting with baited breath for this place to finally open!!  Great service, great food...awesome kimchi!!  10/10 will go again"}
{"text":"Wonderful!!!!
Great place, great tastes, great price... .. #5,6,7,18.... and the spicy pork is good, but filling, so eat it near the end!

Can get smokey near the end of the night, so go around 6 or earlier

This place is a must!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love Korean bbq. We decided to try this place out last night the service was good but today both of us have runs, my boyfriend even threw up. I am currently sitting on the toilet as I write this review. I would avoid this place unless you want to spend the next day living in the bathroom."}
{"text":"BE PREPARED TO WAIT. I was really excited to try this place out. Walked in at 6pm. There were two other parties ahead of us. They told us 15min wait. One party seated the other left. 30 min into our 15min wait we were seated. 15 minutes after being seated we hadn't seen the waitress. There were at least 15 open tables so they were clearly not busy. They were not prepared to open just yet. 45 minutes into our visit no service/drinks/food. We left drove 2 miles north to Manna bbq and were completely amazed with Manna's service and quality."}
{"text":"My fiance and I tried this place on Friday night and it was our first experience with Korean BBQ.  We really did not know how anything there worked and did not get much help from our actual waitress, Julie. 

However, there was a tall, young guy with glasses and a hat that was more than helpful to us and the other customers.  He ended up putting orders in for us, getting refills, and following up to make sure things were taken care of.  He made suggestions for which items to try, brought us sesame oil for our grill, and stepped in wherever needed to make things go smoothly at any table that flagged him down.

I am not sure of the guy's name but he said he was just a runner, not a waiter or manager.  He is very customer-service and detailed oriented and deserves a raise and promotion in the future.  I hope someone there recognizes his potential and helps him get wherever he wants to go in this business."}
{"text":"Wow. Been waiting for this place to open since i was still living in california. And finally now that i live here it finally opens as i was driving by. And yes i was craving for some kbbq. So to start off. As it just opened. They do really need more staff as i can see later on.  This place will get busy. 
So on with the food right. Brisket...pretty damn good and might i add very consistent. Not like other kbbq when you order your second and third serving the quality tends to deminish or you get not so great cuts. Here it was marble through out my stay. Other meats that i order. Beef belly. Real good. Beef tongue, was not chewy and sliced well where when cooked was real soft and didnt have a gamey taste. Bulgogi was amazing. Not too sweet or too salty...seriously beat out Gen on this. And as for ban chans...kimchi was ok,pickled cucumber was pretty good and just normal stuff.
Pricewise its pretty much like most kbbqs around the area. Im loving the fact these are popping up giving more options to the valley. Yelp elitist...take advantage now while the meat is consistent. Cause really. You never know how new places will end up in 2 months time"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I had never been to a Korean restaurant before, so we decided to try this place last night. I'm glad we did. Each table has its own grill in it. You order two dishes at a time per person, and try to fit as much meat on your grill to cook as you can. It cooks quickly, so you pull it off and eat it as you please.

I told the waitress it was our first time, and she was very helpful. I asked her for dish recommendations, and was surprised that she didn't try to sell me on the more expensive menu; that's a real sign of integrity. The food was very good. I would definitely recommend the boneless ribs, they were easily my favorite.

The restaurant only loses one star for a couple reasons. It got really smokey in the building, and started to burn our eyes. I'm not sure the vents over everyone's grills were open. Also, there was a real lack of non meat side dishes on the menu. I know it may sound crazy, but something other than meat would've helped spice up the variety a little bit.

We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Excellent service! Sunny was our server and she was a resource of knowledge and super friendly. Selection for meat and side dishes were fantastic. Perfect start for our new year!"}
{"text":"Very good,  we have been there numerous times with large and small parties. The service is always excellent! This is one of our favorite go to spots!"}
{"text":"Service is horrible. Had to actually get up from our table and walk over to our server who was just sitting across from us ( ignoring us ever so skillfully) to beg for a refill. Refills became nonexistent after this. She dumped all entrees on grill at one time,didn't explain anything to us. My family has never been to a place like this; so a little explanation would have been nice if not helpful. Seafood and chicken were just dumped on grill together. If I could I would give this place no stars. We are a big family that enjoys getting together and eating out. We will never come back to this place again. Be prepared to be ignored than snarled at in Korean for asking for service that your overpaying for.  I've gotten better service at a Panda Express."}
{"text":"Awesome all you can eat Korean BBQ. friendly servers, food was fresh, variety side. great service."}
{"text":"Ok, Seems that Korean BBQ is a new FAD/Trends, and not just here in AZ, but its blowing up in Philippines when we visited last Month... Ok,, 

This place is only 4 weeks old, so they are still hitting some learning curve road blocks,,, running out of meats, and upping their game for customer service, and staffing... So,,, that aside, 

The setup, is pretty nice, Natural Gas piped in from the floor, (should've routed from the back of the tables instead of the front where people kick the fittings when the get in and out of the table), rectangle cooking surface, all in all it was ok. 

The Food.. We tried a bunch of the variations of cuts of protein, and all tasted really fresh, no hint of thawed \"age\" here.. One of the beef items we got was chopped way too much, and was more of a ground beef than anything to grill, but all the other items were good with decent seasoning.. 

With the competition being on every other corner lately, we may give this place one more try, if the other place has a line to be seated.."}
{"text":"This place was very good. We had Hua for a waitress and she was very attentive and even helped cook.It would have been nice to have actual lettuce leaves to wrap meat in like in Korea and more side dishes but otherwise excellent."}
{"text":"Our first time here.  Came across this place by accident.  May I say a happy accident .  Great quality of meat choices that tasted so awesome.  The staff are attentive and so super nice.  The restaurant has a really cool atmosphere and their facilities are clean.  Wish we knew of this place sooner when we had our out-of-town guests here.  We will be returning customers."}
{"text":"I have been living in AZ almost 20years and this place is the best Korean place so far. Meat quality is good they know how to make good kalbi and bulgogi. Their danjang (soy bean paste) stew is super good and the cold noodle, (Nang Myun) both bibim and soup are decent quality. Pleasantly surprised. $27 was worth spending."}
{"text":"Check your bills before leaving here! Ordered the regular for our whole table for 22.99 each and our bills were 36.99 each when we left. My husband did not notice as we were leaving so I went back in to explain to the owner and the woman \"helping\" kept trying to tell me I was wrong, then said she would talk to her boss to get back to me but did not take my phone number until I mentioned she may need it if he was going to contact me.. giving 2 stats because the food was decent but they're obviously not too worried about fixing their mistake."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and wow I was impressed. Probably the biggest menu I've seen and they had seafood and! You're not charged premium for the seafood. We really liked it. Best time to go is lunch because their isn't. A lot of people. I just was missing my fish cake side. But overall well done. Will be back."}
{"text":"So I'll give this place 3 stars. Options were good, Bulgogi (spelled wrong probably) was the best I've ever had as was the beef brisket. They lost me with how hot it was in there, having 2 other parties after us get served (water included) before us, and the biggest one... NO GUARD in front of the stove underneath the table. My knee hit it, burnt the the hell out of it and an hour later it's blistering. Take Caution before deciding to come here. Never burnt my knee before at any prior Korean BBQ restaurant."}
{"text":"Like everybody else, we waited all year for this place to open! The food was excellent. Great variety of meats, and they let us place the food on the grill at our own pace. Service was OK. It got a little smoky from all the grills, but not too bad - considering there's a grill at every table. My primary wish is that there were MORE VEGETABLES. Granted, you can keep ordering them, but seems like it's just a bit of zucchini and mushrooms (and fat slices of onion which I can't eat anyway because of allergies, but others in the party can). We enjoyed it and will be back."}
{"text":"Love the bulgogi and the sides.Love the waitress I had her give me extra wonderful service which is her norm. On the weekends, they have been known to turn away single restaurant goers because they don't want to spend the gas on just one person for the barbecue grill. If you tell them this is illegal, and that you're going to report them if they discriminate against you being a single person, then they will seat you."}
{"text":"Food was 4 stars and service was 1 star. First time trying this place out, we got there @8:30pm and was told that they weren't able to take us because they are closing @9pm. 9pm? It says 11pm online! The lady said she'll get back to us while we waited, and she came back saying it was fine, they'll take us. So then upon seated, I asked our served why were they closing @9pm, she then said that they close @10pm  their ventilation don't even work, so it gets pretty smoking up in there. It's alright though, just know about their hours. Weekdays: close @10pm and weekends close @11pm this is per our server. I don't know if they just get lazy and tell people otherwise"}
{"text":"How could anyone give less than 5 stars here I have no clue! They are amazing. It's been open a month and I barely eat out, well I've been here 5 times. Dinner it's all about the #7 beef or chicken Bubboli or whatever way it's spelled! Also the brisket! YUM. So many amazing things. Service is great, so clean, so nice, well priced, amazing quality. Yum. Get here! And get ready to get hooked lol. Our 10 year old is obsessed. He chose to have his birthday dinner here. And Christy the owner? Love! Thanks Christy, Wa, Sunny and BBQ house you guys rock!"}
{"text":"I love Korean BBQ so much that I bleed, sweat, and cry brisket fat drippings.

Now put that cow tongue on my human tongue. Aw yis!

Anywho, let's cut the chitchat and jump right into the review.  Depending what you order, the portions can be either pretty generous or really skimpy.  Like the pork belly here are ridiculously tiny and extremely frozen.  This bacon comes to you ready to plank [y'all remember when planking was a thing?].  I didn't enjoy how a lot of the thicker cut items were frozen as it made the meat steam.  I want that char-grilled goodness!  The marinades and seasoning are definitely on the softer hand of things as well.  The Sesame Marinated Beef, Angus Prime Brisket, Beef Tongue, Octopus, and Marinated Beef Rib Finger Meat were decent.  Everything else was pretty basic.  The steamed egg is something you should try and the cheese corn is something you can pass on.  The meat quality is pretty average.

When our first round of goods got to the table, our server dumped all our entrees onto the grill and all I could think about was how that raw chicken was tainting my beef tongue.  Since tongue cooks up a lot faster than chicken, I cringed and made sure to overcook the heck out of the tongue to avoid salmonella.  Overcrowding the grill with five entrees also didn't help with the cooking.  Everything was just steaming by that point.  After the second round of food, we asked our server to just set the dishes down and let us grill it ourselves and at our own pace.  The service was pretty sparse and flagging our waitress down to order more food was a challenge as they were shorthand and it was quite busy.  There were long periods where we just sat around staring at our dirty grill [which we did have to call someone over to change] while either waiting for food, waiting for water refills, or waiting for our waitress to reappear so we can order more food.  Also, perhaps it was just our table, but our grill had some uneven heat going on.

This place also has the worst ventilation system.  We all know you'll end up getting smoky at KBBQ but this was like tear gas status.  It was insanely smoky and one of my friends had to step outside because she was starting to feel ill from all the smoke.  The smoke can literally be seen sitting in the air like Karl the Fog in San Francisco.  They kept their doors open to try and keep the place clear but it didn't really help and I can only imagine how much smoke will be trapped in that building come summertime when the doors are shut and the A/C is on. 

All in all, I don't think I'll be back.  Why settle when there are some great AYCE KBBQ places out there with much better service and product?  Also, if you do come here, I suggest bringing cash.  Splitting a check is a nightmare here."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for this location to open up for months every time I drove by and honestly gave up checking after a while. Suddenly, I received a phone call from a friend who confirmed that this location was officially opened. We were so excited to give it a try the same week. 

When we first arrived, the tables were so dirty that we ended up switching the table ourselves. 10 minutes later, our waitress finally showed up. She seemed lost and hardly showed up at first. After our friend arrived, a different person showed up to help our waitress out. From that point forward, the service was becoming great again. 

The food portion is generous and I do love their side dishes. Their cold noodle was absolutely delicious. If you like all you can eat BBQ, this is a good place to go. I will most definitely come back here again with friends."}
