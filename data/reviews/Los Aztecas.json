{"text":"Food was average , the pricing was really good but as the old saying goes , you get what you pay for . The portions for the lunch special was really small . Thought it was a kids menu . Service was good! The waitress was hot !"}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican cuisine!  One of our favorite local restaurant!  We frequent this restaurant every chance we get!  Keep doing what you're doing!"}
{"text":"Terrible strawberry margaritas!  And when we tried to get them to correct the mistake, the laughed at us!  Good thing part of our party could speak Spanish!"}
{"text":"Just moved to this area and am not impressed. We've given it three chances and try something different each time. No matter what we get it is bland and soggy. There is a dang child working the register and like 5 employees doing nothing every time we go. I literally make better Mexican food than this and I am Polish."}
{"text":"We have been to this restaurant several times. They closed the old location and opened the new one. This new location is lacking in taste, quality and service. We really were hoping it would have the same flare as the old one and keep giving it a chance but it just seems to keep going down hill. The food is okay. Cheese dip a little watery, more onions and peppers in chimichangas than chicken. However, after the past few times, I am not sure we will be returning. We have had the same waitress (young girl with glasses, long dark hair) the past few times and she is terrible. Last night two tables that were seated after us got their drinks and cheese dip before our drink order was even taken. Every time we have had this waitress she always has to come back to our table and ask us what we ordered and when the food is brought out something is always incorrect or lacking. She never refills drinks, EVER. You will have to track someone down and ask, if it's her that you ask....you will wait and wait and wait. Last time we were there she delivered our drinks, cheese dip, THEN THE CHECK.....she gave us the check before we even had our food. Same thing last night. Never got refills and when we requested them she brought the check instead of refills. We also noticed that she wasn't refilling anyone elses drinks at her other tables either. My husband never complains, always tips and last night he was ready to leave the tip line blank. However, we did leave 15% minimum out of courtesty but if we go back we will request a different wait person. She has no business working in a restaurant what so ever. After speaking with a co worker this morning that goes there as well they said they have had the same issue with the same waitress before when they went and they wont go back because of her."}
{"text":"Fast service but food is kinda meh. I would say the appetizers are the the best thing on the menu I feel. Tortillas are store bought and not homemade. I would say average at best."}
{"text":"Happy to have found this place for some quick and tasty mexican food just a few minutes from home. We typically order takeout from here every few weeks and have never been disappointed. Have also dined in occasionally, and we thought the service was great. Food came out quickly, servers were attentive. Highly recommend the sopa de pollo - absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"I had fried burritos covered in cheese with beans and rice. This. Meal was delicious. The staff was very courteous and nice. My daughter had a kids queseadea and I had a couple of bites best quesedea I've had in a long time. The chips  were a little bland but they are bottomless. The salsa was yummy. I definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"Reviewing the Indian Land SC location. I have only ordered the fajitas (dinner and lunch) and the times I have been there, food has been consistent and quick. Plenty of meat and veggies with your fajitas. Rice is fluffy and flavorful. Haven't tried anything else, but I know I can't go wrong with fajitas! Friendly staff, offered a \"to-go\" cup, and I was in/out pretty quickly."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican Food for a great price, great ambiance for almost any crowd and great service!! This will become a regular spot for hubby and I."}
{"text":"Disappointed with new menu. Chili poblanos are gone. Ordered chilaquiles Mexicanos and it was very bland, as was my son's dish. Seems like Lios Aztecas  is trying to Amercanize rather than be authentic."}
{"text":"Food is awesome been going here since high school. Best Mexican in fort mill don't listen to the haters"}
{"text":"I live near this place and we probably eat there at least once a week.  It's our favorite Mexican food in the South Charlotte/Fort Mill/Rock Hill area for sure.  The staff are all very friendly and nice.  It's not a place you go for the decor or atmosphere, but if you want good food at a good price and quick, this place is great!"}
{"text":"We moved to Fort Mill this past July.  This restaurant was suggested to us.  We were not disappointed at all! Food is quality. Staff friendly.  Very fast service!   We take all our visitors here.   Go for it and give it a try!"}
{"text":"Best authentic Mexican style restaurant in town! The prices are very good but the food is amazing. Ive tried literally half the menu and plan to try the rest soon. Service is awesome and atmosphere is like no other in town. If you havent tried Los Aztecas then you gotta come out and try them."}
{"text":"Visited Los Aztecas for lunch today, just to try something new. The restaurant is just about the only successful thing in this shopping center, and we've been scared off for years by the run-down appearance of everything around it. Still, every time we drive by, we see a TON of cars and a lot of action happening at this little restaurant, so we thought we'd give it a try.

The back patio is a wonderful place to spend a nice sunny afternoon. Service was good, and as we had noted from previous drive-bys, the restaurant was very popular. We ordered beers (on a Sunday! When did that change in Fort Mill?) and we each ordered one of the lunch specials.

The food was okay, but not exceptional. The chips and salsa were good. Our main dishes arrived quickly - almost disturbingly quickly - under 5 minutes from the time we ordered them. The chicken in my burrito seemed to be basic shredded chicken just rolled up and thrown under a heat plate. The \"avocado salad\" was just a ton of lettuce, a slice of tomato, and a tablespoon of guacamole on one corner.

For these complaints though, I will say this - they were willing to work with us on sauces. I ordered an entree that came with a mole sauce, and the waitress let me request a tomatillo/verde sauce instead. My husband wanted a different sauce on his meal, and he got just what he wanted.

Los Aztecas has the potential to be great, but at the moment it's only \"good\" because the food seemed slapped together. We're going to come again for dinner to order some \"specials\" to see if those meals seem more well thought out.

If you're in the area and are craving Mexican food, stop by and have lunch or dinner. I know that we sure will. Just because it's not 5 stars doesn't mean it's not a good bargain and decent food!"}
{"text":"Visited this place for the first time in a really long time. We usually go to Don Pedro's in Pineville for awesome Mexican...but this was a Wed. night and we wanted something local.  First, the waiter took forever to bring chips/salsa and take our drink order. Getting the drinks took a while too.  I made the mistake of saying I needed a few more minutes to decide on my order.  He didn't come back for about 15.  The 4 servers working seemed stretched thin by the crowd.  When our food finally did come, my order was wrong (had mushrooms inside the burrito plus I had asked for no pepper...there were TONS of peppers and hardly any chicken).  The guacamole tasted store bought, as did the mediocre salsa.  The guac at Don Pedro's is made table side, so you know it's fresh. Took another 20 minutes to get our check. We will definitely not be coming back."}
{"text":"The chicken quesadilla was ridic. Get it and don't even think about not getting it. 

Put hot sauce on it."}
{"text":"We love this place , always good service, food hot and fresh! The best margaritas !!!
In the neighborhood , so very convenient , love the fajitas and arroz con pollo!!! Never disappointed !!!"}
{"text":"We eat here often. Staff is fun and attentive. My kids practice spanish with them. The food is great and we have tried a lot of Mexican restaurants before discovering this. It is in a sketchy shopping plaza but it is safe. Patio is great and we never feel rushed."}
{"text":"Not sure why ratings are low, have been here many times and never been disappointed. If you are looking for Mexican- this will hit the spot.

Always great service and food exceeds expectations for a traditional Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"I was really wanting good Mexican food so I met my wife here for lunch.  We arrived shortly after they opened.  The dining room was (predictably) empty so we were seated right away.  The waiter came out with chips and salsa and promptly took our drink orders.  The chips and salsa were your typical chips and salsa.  Nothing fancy.  The waiter (who, by the way, was engaging and very nice) brought our entrees.  I ordered the super enchiladas and they were really good.  My wife ordered a taco and chile relleno and she enjoyed it.  We were in and out in about 30 minutes (keep in mind we were there at about 11:15am).  I will most definitely be eating here again."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT AT THIS RESTAURANT. My wife and I found finger nails in our food. This place needs to be shut down!!!!"}
{"text":"Always enjoy eating here. Good food, service and prices. Nice locally owned business."}
{"text":"They are all a friendly staff but after my meal I went to the bathroom and threw up this has never happen to me after tonight I will be going to Sabor instead"}
{"text":"The lunch was good. We ordered the enchilladas, the fajitas & shrimp quesadillas. We liked the enchilladas & quesadillas. They were very good w/ nice presentation the fajitas were ok tasting but were not served like most restaurants. It was not served with lettuce, tomatoes, sour cream, salsa or guacamole. I was disappointed. Overall, it was a good experience & we would go back"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in the Fort Mill/Tega Cay area. The place is super clean and the wait staff is awesome. The menu is great, I just wish they had tortas. The salsa seemed fresh and the chips are not overly salted like charanda. I would ask for Malicio for a waiter....he is great. It's the only place I'll go for Mexican near the house."}
{"text":"A fantastic gem! Very flavorful food without too much spice! Everything is homemade. The chicken soup is the best I've ever had, anywhere! Fresh made margaritas...no mix. Service was perfect too! I'll be back - often!"}
{"text":"Food is always great. Service is always great but the menus are always nasty. They need to clean the menus more often. Today I seriously had part of a tortilla chip in my menu along with sticky pages. So please clean your menus."}
{"text":"Mixed feelings about this place. It gets 3 stars primarily for existing; it is the only Mexican style restaurant in the immediate are I am aware of and being someone that really likes Mexican, I will continue to come. 
The service is great and the food is slightly below average. I asked for something spicy and they said they could bring me a spicy salsa, but did not have any spicy food on the menu (that blew me away and a huge negative). 
It is quite inexpensive and you get health lunch portions (healthy meaning you get how much one should eat, which is less than most other places). 
I had the lunch chimichanga with water for $7.09 plus tip. Overall, I would give it 2.5, but rounding up since have to do whole stars."}
{"text":"The food was so bad here I felt obligated to post my first review ever.  The chips were stale and thick.  They probably came out of a huge bag they bought a month ago.  My burrito was covered in a spaghetti sauce.  It would have been great in lasagna.  Actually it would have been bad on that but it did taste like Italian.  The enchilada sauce had a decidedly curry flavor.  The guacamole had very little avocado if any at all in it.  I ate about 1 bite of each and lost my appetite.  DO NOT EAT HERE."}
{"text":"By far my go to Mexican food restaurant in fort mill/south CLT and I'm pretty spoiled growing up eating in the Mexican village in Detroit. The food is fast hot and delish!! My favorites are the pork tamales and beef enchiladas. My dad loves the quesadilla he had with pineapple on it (sry can't remember name). My family - 2 seniors, 3 adults and one preschooler have eaten here many times together. Here's some feedback:

The seniors and child won't eat the salsa. It's spicy and they only have the one kind on the tables with fresh chips. Chips are tasty and served warm. The spice loving adults loved the salsa.

Childrens servings are pretty big and reasonable.

They don't serve coffee or hot tea. My mom and I were a bit disappointed.

Service is very fast and friendly. 

Chiles relanos were a hit and not spicy per adult and senior. 

1 adult disappointed with what is called a taquito on the menu. Looks more like a tostada. Lesson is to ask for recommendations based on what you like or don't. I hate onions and they've always told me what to avoid or able to accommodate.

Margaritas are good and very reasonable. Get a pitcher! Combinations are a great deal but read carefully as not all of them include beans and rice. Oh and I love their beans and rice! Don't be discouraged by the vacant buildings around - the food is great. Ambience kid friendly and upbeat."}
{"text":"I always kept seeing this place on my driving route and never went in.  I decided to go with the family and my rule of thumb is always correct.  If the salsa is good with the chips you get that should be warm it is a winner.  With that said I really enjoyed my meal.  I had the shrimp chimichanga, though when receiving my plate I said to myself what a small chimichanga.  But it was loaded with shrimps and delicious.  I will come back again."}
{"text":"Food quantities were nice service was nice but the food lacked flavor.... Salsa was bland, Rice was dry, beans no taste, my chimichanga had more onions and peppers than chicken... he thing I enjoyed most was the tea...I prefer Charanda near Baxter personally."}
{"text":"We love this place. Fast service, great food. Perfect for a family friendly, quick meal."}
{"text":"Am amazed that people still go here.  And doubly amazed that it remains open.  The Fort Mill location closed long ago.  No surprise.

Guess there is truth in the saying that some people lack a sense of taste.  I read the gushing reviews and wonder just where those people were!

It is not authentic Mexican food, although I guess if a Latino cooks it they can so claim it is.  It is mush, bland starchy goo.  Even their tortillas lack taste, similar the the M brand made in Texas and shipped all over the USA.

Good service, bad food.  If you end up here and just can't escape, pour lots of hot sauce on it.

But best advice is to not go here at all."}
{"text":"So, I ended up in SC/NC for some family issues, but it doesn't mean I don't eat and frankly hospital foods get old, really quick.  So, after taking a mid-day break I decided to hit Los Aztecas for lunch.  Now, given, it was about 2pm and between normal meal rushes, but you still expect a place to be ready.  As I walked in, there were 3 employees sitting at a table directly in front of the door just chatting it up.  I chose to sit at the bar since it was just me, and as I came around the corner, the bartender was in a customer chair, watching the futbol game.  He did get up and get me water, but then called a waitress to take my order.. at his bar... really?  In any event, the food was average, I had a 3-taco combo.  Everything was mostly fresh.  The tacos were good, and the beans were ok.  I asked for the queso to go with the chips and it was REALLY loose and mostly tasteless.  Can't say I'd run back to get here again, just a relatively lackluster performance."}
{"text":"Best food and service.  The meal was delicious!   The chicken chimichangas are so tasty! Salsa was excellent."}
{"text":"One word to describe it. Fantastic. I wide variety of different Mexican dishes with some other cultures and that's what makes this restaurant so much better then all other Mexican restaurants. Definitely would recommend this restaurant over all the other Mexican ones around. Great food great bar great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Came in with the wife for dinner on a Tuesday night. We were hesitant due to the mixed reviews, but thought we would see for ourselves. We did not regret the decision to eat here and will be back again. The staff was super friendly, and the food was great! I had the enchilada, tamale combo, and my wife had a taco salad and a delicious chicken soup. Neither dish disappointed in either way. If you live in the fort Mill area and are in the mood for Mexican, I would do yourself a favor and stop in here for some awesome & humble Mexican fare"}
{"text":"One of our favorite spots in Fort Mill.  Very courteous staff, consistently good food."}
{"text":"Got the Chimichanga on a Friday night... Meh...
The beef was tough and gristly, maybe half a teaspoon of guacamole... Nicely seasoned and tasted pretty good... But honestly, I was expecting much better ... Maybe next time I will try the fajitas"}
{"text":"Food is very good. Portions are extremely large and priced very low. Service is hit or miss and it can sometime take more than 30 minutes to get your entrees."}
{"text":"When we got to the restaurant we had to wait (which wasn't a problem at all). But two tables became available, the staff took a while to clean them. They brought us chips and salsa and when we got almost to the bottom of the chip basket there was a long strand of hair. Our server didn't act like he cared when we told him. The chips were stale anyways. He brought us a new basket and they were also stale and we asked for some more salsa which we never got. When we got to the entrée we got chimichanga with chicken. The chicken was like rubber and Bland. The server wasn't attentive at all. Long story short I would definitely not recommend this restaurant to anybody nor will I be back."}
{"text":"Sorry to be contradictory but our experience was awful!!  Be advised if you like authentic Mexican food this is NOT your restaurant!! If you like fresh food this is NOT your restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Food came out in five minutes!  Prompt service.  Good food, nothing fancy but hot and tasty.  Pretty amazing to be in and out of a sit down restaurant with a twenty minute lunch."}
{"text":"Being new to the area and missing our hometown family Mexican Restaurant, we decided to give Los Aztecas a try. We were not disappointed at all! From great service (our waiter was Carlos), to excellent food, we will be going back!"}
{"text":"Ok so as much as I don't want to admit it ive been here 3 days in a row. I have been working in ft mill for about 8 months now and the only \"Mexican\" option is Qdoba.....not saying theres anything wrong with them I go there too buuuttttt I pretty much live for my next meal at a Mexican restaurant (hence me eating there 3 days in a row) Now granted even if they weren't good this would probably still be my go to place on my breaks but lucky for me they are awesome!! This was definitely my big win for the week as I was getting pretty sad about my options in the area. 

But on to the food of course! So far I have had the fajitas, the tacos (chicken and beef) and a taco salad... All things amazing! like leave to go back to work feeling like I cant survive because I stuffed my face amazing. Everything is SO fresh! the fajitas have the classic onions tomatoes and peppers but also mushrooms which I don't like but I can work around them so its cool.  The chicken is perfectly marinated and cooked and the taco salad was great because the lettuce was so amazingly fresh and crispy ( I am a lettuce freak it has to be at its freshest).  Also the service there is outstanding! everyone is so friendly and everything came out quick. 

They get busy for lunch from what ive seen as they have a pretty big lunch menu that runs until 3 pm and 2.99 margaritas all day ....... Yes you read that right 2.99 MARGARITAS ALL DAY and they DONT SUCK to be honest they were pretty tasty! They have plenty of parking as they are part of a shopping center. Definitely recommend this place if youre in the area and craving delicious food."}
{"text":"I'm from Texas and I was born eating Mexican food. This is the closest taste to home tex mex that I've found in the Carolinas and I've been here 5 years. They're always very nice and quick too."}
{"text":"Our neighbors gave us good reviews of this place. We went in with great expectations and were so disappointed. It's difficult to mess up Mexican food. Food wasn't good. Presentation was bad. Restaurant didn't appear to be very clean....they had a refrigerator in the front of the restaurant with just \"stuff\" in it....like sauces, beer, etc.  Not good to see that out front. Absolutely nothing worth going back for.Until we get a real authentic Mexican restaurant in the area, we'll just go to Zapata's."}
{"text":"If you're on the hunt for some very well prepared Mexican Food, than Los Aztecas is a great choice.  They prepare great dishes that are about as good as you get living on the Rio Grande.  I grew up in deep south Texas and this food is a decent substitute.

Now my challenges are more along the service side.  I don't like to feel rushed.  When I go to a sit down restaurant I like to enjoy the atmosphere, try the adult beverages, and enjoy my meal slowly.  This place doesn't really give you that experience.  

Last time I visited I was greeted at the door take to my booth asked what I wanted to drink and that was it.  I finally ordered a beer, but they were adament that things move along, so before I even got to sit on the Negro Modelo our server had been back twice for my order.

Just because I saw where this was going, I decided to place an order for cheese nachos. She asked my if I wanted some meat on that and I pointed with my finger to the menu item I wanted: cheese nachos. It didn't have meat.  She then proceeded to place my order.  

The food arrived quickl.  As expected...she added meat. That of course is more expensive, but I wasn't interested in complaining. It was delicious.  

Next I saw my server was to deliver my bill. Never got a 2nd beer. Kind of disappointed about that.  I like to enjoy the beverages.  So, without fanfare I paid and left.  

5 Stars for Food and Atmosphere.  2 Stars for Service.  I like to enjoy restaurants.  If I wanted fast food Mexican I'd have driven through Taco Bell.  

3 Stars Overall."}
{"text":"This is my first visit here and I was very happy. The food was delicious! The staff was great! I will definitely be back here to try more of their menu! Yummmm"}
{"text":"I have been  here a few times ,each time I have tried something different which has been very good. I will say tonight the margarita I had too much mix and not enough tequila. But service is always good and very friendly."}
{"text":"Haven't had a bad experience here love this place !! One of the best Mexican restarurants in the area"}
{"text":"Good food. Waitress was a novice but nice. Loved the salsa (probably not custom recipe though).  Good options for vegetarian (my wife)."}
{"text":"We went here one Friday night for what can be the best experience - Mexican and margaritas. Unfortunately this place just wasn't as great as it could have been. 

When we walked in we were escorted to our table by a child. Like you probably are too young to even get a work permit child. But after that odd start we had several waiters come up to make sure we had salsa and drinks ordered. The service was definitely attentive! 
On to the main disappointment of the night - the pitcher of lime margaritas that we split. To put it kindly, it was pretty not great. Very weak and an unappealing taste. Not what you want to kick off your Friday night! 

The man ordered a chimichanga which he was happy with. I ordered the special dinner that was a bit of a sampler. The food was good but the ground beef in the taco and burrito lacked seasoning. We both left cheaply stuffed but probably wouldn't return."}
{"text":"It's unclaimed on Yelp... Sooooo...

Marginal reviews, but my girlfriend and I were looking for something close to my place. I have lived around the corner for almost nine years and haven't spent much time in this strip mall, so I've never eaten here before.

We didn't receive huge fanfare when we walked in, but were promptly seated. It was pretty bare for a Saturday night.

Customer service was marginal (as far as checking back and what not), but it wasn't horrible. The food came out rather quickly and was rather tasty. No issues with our visit and they give you plenty of food!

Can never go wrong with complimentary chips and salsa."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend have come here every Tuesday for a few years now because we love the food, the people, and the margaritas. We get margaritas everywhere we go and we have never found any we like more than their Texas margaritas. The staff is so nice and the food is always great"}
{"text":"I have been frequenting this Restaurant for about 5 years now (since my employer moved to Fort Mill). Recently I have been experiencing a huge decline in service, it has been MUCH SLOWER. On my most recent visit I discovered they changed their menu. I had the Fajita's and it was definitely the worst meal I have had there. There was hardly any chicken at all, it was mostly onion. In the past I have been loyal to the Fajita's, Chimichanga, Speedy Gonzales and Chicken Taco Salad. I will go again and try some of my other faves on the new menu but at this point it is not looking good."}
{"text":"Favorite Mexican Restaurant in Fort Mill!! Good service! The food is consistently great! We eat here 1-2x a week! Highly recommend! The gentleman that bust the tables always puts on an impressive show while cleaning! Love our servers!!!"}
{"text":"Ditto to what my daughter posted.  We won't be back.  We have given this place several chances to improve n they choose to only get worst.  .  We drive further for our Mexican food fix.  I refuse to spend my money for poor service n poor tasting food.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"They need to be more organized with the queuing system but this is excusable.  Fajitas were not hot. Tamales was hard."}
{"text":"Just recently started visiting the Mexican joint after the one closer was shut down to make way for Wal Mart Neighborhood Market.  Several of the same people work here that worked at the one at the Dobys Bridge and Tom Hall location.  Very good prices, nightly drink specials, and food has been consistently good.  This is your typical Mexican restaurant for this area, but there are a few authentic items not on the menu such as the Mexican tacos, meat, cilantro, onions, lime and sauce to add.  Worth the visit and I recommend."}
{"text":"We tried this place after moving down here. Maybe it was because it was Cinco De Mayo but yuck. It took our server 30 minutes to get to our drinks,  another thirty for our order. I thought maybe it's because she was busy but no, she only had two other tables. Food was pretty bad, quacamole was like green water from a bag, margaritas were horrible. I usually give restaurants another chance but with Sabor right here, I'm good!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch on 12/4/16.  Lunch is until 3pm.  We sat down at 2:55 and ordered drinks.  Waitress did not come back to take food order until 3:02pm which is when she rang the order into the Point of sale system.  Because of this, the restaurant charged us dinner prices which was $10 higher for two people.  Manager would not adjust our bill even though they agreed we were seated and ordered drinks before 3pm.  Ridiculous!  Do not go to this restaurant as they are NOT customer friendly.  Go to Charandas at Baxter just 1 mile down the road!"}
{"text":"The Piña Coladas we ordered were not your usual thick kind, a bit watery with crushed ice-that was an omen of what was about to come.

The chips tasted as if they came from a bag and were warmed up. The poblano pepper entree I ordered looked wilted, not too fresh. The rice and refried beans were pretty much the best part of the meal. 

Will we eat here again, probably not."}
{"text":"This was a surprisingly good hole in the wall Mexican restaurant. The decor was bright and colorful. We went in the middle of the afternoon, so the restaurant was pretty empty and we were seated right away. 

They start you off with complimentary chips and salsa. We then ordered the queso fundido y chorizo which was absolutely amazing. It was probably the best thing I've ever had at a Mexican restaurant. For my main dish I got the Hawaiian Quesadilla which was also very good. I tried the Pollo con Crema that my friends ordered which was amazing as well. 

The service was good, the food was awesome, and the decor was lively. I would definitely come back in the future."}
{"text":"Update:  We went again and the service is worst.  The server (a small young man) was ignoring our requests in front of us and he didn't care he was doing that and no apologies.  Not going back there again... 

From before:  Not as good anymore.  The food has gotten worse.  They serve ketchup in little sealed envelopes, and it is a real hassle to deal with if you have small kids.  I used to enjoy coming here but overall, it is not getting better.  Sorry."}
{"text":"I used to love this place!  They had a location in Fort Mill near the Wal-Mart grocery and the food was fabulous. As was the management.   I especially loved Daniel and Jose! I probably ate there twice a week and also takeout.   When they closed due to Wal-Mart we had to drive either to Indian Land or Tega Cay.  I did that for awhile regularly and still spent lots of $$ on takeout.   Over the last couple years the quality has gone down quite a bit while the prices have gone up.  I haven't ordered in a long time, preferring to drive to Cherry Rd to El Cancun for my Mexican fix.  So, last night after a workday, I decided to give them one more chance.  Not only did they get my order wrong, the quantities were what you'd expect in a kids meal. I will not be back.  Los Aztecas has lost a long time customer of 10+ years."}
{"text":"Let me be the first to say that this place is really freakin' good.  We've been here twice since it opened and the service was fast and friendly and the food was delicious.  Better than Charanda near Baxter village. Can't wait to eat there again! :)"}
{"text":"The strip mall is run down and going away for the new Walmart grocery store.  Decor is okay but our family loves the food.  I can't find Pollo Con Creme any where else that is better. Add onions..."}
{"text":"This restaurant is sub par at best. The queso was ok, not great and the food was about the same. I love Mexican and this place disappointed."}
{"text":"Not good food. Servers are fine, but their food is either bland, overcooked, or not how you ordered it.  Plus, steer clear of the margaritas.  I'm pretty sure they do not put tequila I them, or if they do, it's too little to justify the $7.50 price tag."}
{"text":"Friendly service but otherwise, pretty standard compared to other inexpensive restaurants of this type in the Charlotte area. This is the only one that I know of in Fort Mill, so there's that.

Chips were good, salsa was a little more watery than I like but otherwise tasty. I had the two burritos lunch special, my daughter had a chimichanga. Both were good portions and they were quality.

As I said, service was good. I'd return here."}
{"text":"Good food, great atmosphere!!! The service here is where they shine! This is an excellent place to take the family, they are so great with kids!!!! And they also have fantastic drink specials!"}
{"text":"Food is on the pricy side for what you get (in terms of quantity/quality).  Service is usually quick and polite.  Decent place for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Love this place! There's also one in Tega Cay. Would be great if there was an online menu for either of the establishments, but so far, I've come up empty. @Maggie K. They do have another less spicy salsa upon request. I know because when we come in they always provide \"another\" salsa for my granddaughter. *g*"}
