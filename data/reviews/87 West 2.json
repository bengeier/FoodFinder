{"text":"Great atmosphere. Friendly staff. Knowledgeable. Have come in here many times and have tried many things on the menu as well as different menu items. Have never been disappointed. The flatbreads are really good. The cheesecake is good. The cheese and dessert fondues are good. not excellent. but good. Nice spot for relaxing, chatting, having some snacks and wine."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and a great place to go for drinks and small plates.  The only thing I don't like is the overwhelming smell of the kitchen.  This place needs a better exhaust/ventilation system."}
{"text":"87 West is a great place to visit for pure, unadulterated \"down time\". I frequent this establishment often and always enjoy the experience. Great drinks, comfy chairs and the patio has a great view! On my last visit, there was a gentleman playing the guitar with a sultry voice- really awesome. As far as the service goes- the wait staff is very attentive, the drinks offer a good pour and the food is delightful. My only rub is that they got rid of the crackers for the cheese plate- but hey- a girl can't have everything!!!! 

Overall- it's a great place for a date, a girls night or a solo mission."}
{"text":"To say this place is fancy would be an understatement.  From the aroma and ambiance of the rich mahogany decor to the eclectic wine menu, I was absolutely overcome by the classiness of this fine establishment!  The offerings from the kitchen epitomize the word gourmet as well; the chorizo flatbread I had was like that of the finest five star restaurant in Mexico City and it's counterpart in Venice.  

But what really made the place shine like a diamond (not a small one, but that big, heart shaped one in the movie Titanic) was my server, Ashley.  Although she appeared to be serving every other table on a crowded Friday night, she made me feel like I was a regular.  It was my first visit!  She was polite, knowledgable, and lightning fast!  At times I wondered if she had an identical twin working there as well!  I've eaten at thousands of restaurants and I know a professional when I see one.  Top class!  

I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love this place!  I went to meet my girlfriend for lunch and she had her two little kids.  We were a little apprehensive because you wouldn't think this place would be kid friendly.  We sat on the patio so the kids can play on the grass.  The staff was super welcoming and made our experience a great one!  We had the sliders and tots and they were the perfect snack especially after a long morning of shopping!  I've been here several times and I highly recommend their happy hour as well."}
{"text":"This is a great little bar- hardly feels like you're in the center of Crocker park. The happy hour specials for drinks are great (and happy hour lasts forever!). The few times I've eaten things have been tasty, but I don't go out of my way for the food. Definitely good atmosphere whether it's patio weather or nice to be cozy by the fire!"}
{"text":"Came in last night and got to try their new menu. 
Our waitress, Courtney was wonderful, answered all our questions and recommended what wines and food to try. Tried a fume blanc, which is now my husband's and I favorite wine. 
Per her recommendation had the lobster nachos to start, fajita tacos, lobster Mac&cheese and chocolate fondue for dessert. 
We will definitely be back to try more! 
Trivia night was a bonus!"}
{"text":"I really like the patio, and they have good happy hour deals. There Sangrai is delicious and available for happy hour. Only draw back is that alot of the food items tend to be on the lighter side."}
{"text":"We have had a great service and the Christmas lights are amazing what a great atmosphere.  The fireplace is sets  the ambulance perfectly."}
{"text":"This is my second visit here, and the food & service were the same level of my first visit!

The food is hot & yum.
The service is quick & the staff are friendly!

I ordered margarita flatbread which was crunchy at the edges & thin in the middle with fresh ingredients. The only thing I didn't like about it was the amount of fresh tomato slices on the top of the flatbread. It was too much to my taste so I ended up removing most of them!

The crispy tots were hot & crispy indeed.

This place so far is one of my fav. Restaurants at the crocker park!

One last thing.. today is Sunday which means the happy hours are all the day, and my check for the both orders was less than 10 $ yay!"}
{"text":"It  appears that this place is open for lunch only on Saturday and Sunday now."}
{"text":"First of all the atmosphere here is really cute with s fireplace and comfy seating areas. The tator tots were fresh and tasty. We wished there were more \"normal\" appetizers there like cheese curds. The drinks and selection are great but the prices are a bit steep. Wish they would lower the prices a bit"}
{"text":"Stopped here for appetizers and drinks after work. Great location in the middle of Crocker Park. I liked the food, good atmosphere, and friendly service."}
{"text":"Every Thursday is 2 for 40 and Charles the head Chef was awesome I will definitely be returning for another date night with my wife"}
{"text":"My sister and I came here for lunch and really enjoyed this cozy place. Friendly service and great small plates. The loaded tots were my favorite, but the lobster nachos were good too. I also enjoyed the dirty bird martini which had some Sriracha and a blue cheese stuffed olive (yum!)"}
{"text":"Service is a little lacking but for happy hour this place can't be beat. On Sunday it is all day happy hour which translates to 4 dollar drinks and appetizers. The flatbread was pretty great for 4 dollars. If it is not happy hour, the place is way too expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"87 West has a great atmosphere, awesome drink menu that changes seasonally and tremendous service! Donn was our server! He was knowledgable about the wine, liquor menu and the food menu! I highly reccomend the chicken salad sliders! 
This place does not allow children or babies, which is nice for an adult evening out! Fun place for a date or a night out with friends!"}
{"text":"twas a few nights before christmas, and all through my hood
not a creature was stirring, and i was feeling good
with my cats comfy cozy, and my phone energy zapped
i had just settled down for a long winter's nap

...that is until a friend from the neighborhood called me soon after and said he'd be at my house in five minutes to come take me out for \"F#&% It Night\".

layer upon layer, i bundled myself up to face the arctic chill accosting the land of cleve, and headed out, brave-faced and sober with a bubbling pre-christmas excitement buzz only experienced that few magical days before christmas.

we headed here to meet friends, amidst the jolly holiday shoppers and land of giving souls.  with general empathy for all men, we shared the holiday cheer all the while merging into an unforeseen lane at crocker park in search of 87 west.  the jolly shopper in the car to the right and a bit back of us shared her holiday cheer through loving hand gestures and what i can only assume were christmas carols sung by a choir of one.  with such energy and exaggeration exemplified through her facial expressions and movements behind the wheel, i can only assume she, above all, was filled with the christmas spirit.

as we fended off more holiday cheer for only a few brief moments, we finally arrived at 87 west.  cracka park sure knows how to create moments filled with holiday zest.  in case you're wondering, don't park on the south side of the cracka if you're headed to this wine bar.  and don't ask random holiday passers by if they know where we can find a good drink in front of dick's.  

but fyi, 87 west is in front of dick's. sporting goods.

once inside, i have to say 87 west does the holiday right.  white christmas lights abounding, and an all glass wall to observe the holiday hustle and bustle while sitting by the fire and drinking a glass of wine with friends is the way to relax.  even when more patrons added to the holiday relaxation retreat, the place never seemed crowded.  

they offer a decent menu of affordable wines, appetizers (vietnamese calamari?  hmmm....), flat bread pizzas, fondues, and desserts.  i'll get back to that in a moment.

but back to my premise:  each holiday season, the other friends we had met for the evening were experiencing their holiday tradition:  F&#% It Night.  one night each holiday season they interrupt the insanity of holiday shopping, gatherings, penny pinching, and spreading the holiday cheer like the plague to treat themselves to a dinner and night out. when normal behavior would illicit a \"no, i can't, can't afford it\"- instead it is \"yes, i will indulge, thank you.\"  they had previously been down the way to blake's seafood for lobster tails, and night capped with a few glasses of wine here.  

we met up with them a few glasses in.  a bottle of wine later, the perfect end to an imperfect day seemed to be the pumpkin cheesecake.  it's description on the menu tantalizing, graham cracker crust and creamy pumpkin goodness seemed to call to me like what i can only assume were from the woman from the cut off car's angelic voice could have done.

our server, who seemed very kind, and apologetic, returned to the table to let me know the pumpkin cheesecake was no more.   so much for F#$% It Night.  but then, the holiday reared it's beautiful face in the time of giving.  the chef prepared an order of chocolate fondue for us instead.

WHAT???  CHOCOLATE?  

sir, allow me to hug you and spread my holiday cheer to you as well.  don't worry, there's an ointment for that.

the chocolate fondue, more than double the value and amount of food than the original order, was DELICIOUS.  blackberries, apples, graham crackers with melted marshmallow, nilla wafers, and pretzels accompany the gooey heaven of chocolate warming the plate.  we devoured it like vultures on a newly killed piece of flesh.

too graphic?  sorry.  it was effin good.

87 West may not have won over many yelpers hearts yet, but the chef gets a hug from me for his holiday gift of love in the form of chocolate.  

yes, it's that easy.

it was as if the chef could have been the man in red, himself.

He wasn't  chubby or plump, but a tattooed jolly  elf,
And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself;
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,
Soon gave us food to devour and pounds to shed;
He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,
And filled up out bellies; then turned with a jerk,
And laying his finger aside of his nose, (health code decision pending)
And giving a nod, to the back of the kitchen he vanished;
He must have sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,
And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.
But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight,
\"Happy Christmas to all, and to all a goodnight.\""}
{"text":"No Complaints Here!

I visited for Sunday Brunch because my friends and I found that they have $12 bottomless mimosas! They come in 4 different flavors: Pineapple, OJ, Cranberry and Grapefruit. 

I ordered the Eggs Benedict and the hollendaise sauce was impeccable! They used real ham and not deli style or Canadian bacon. Oh and don't let those potatoes fool you- they are AMAZING! The whole dish was wonderful! My friends raved about the bacon even though I did not try it. I also tried a bite of my friends Belgian waffles and the whipped cream was divine! It was a cinnamon whip cream."}
{"text":"This was my second time here and this time the waiter was totally unaware of the yelp coupon that I had successfully used before. I asked him to check with his manager and he said it was all good but did not end up taking it off the bill. If this establishment is offering yelp based perks and coupons then the staff should be aware . Other than this experience we enjoy the drinks and food."}
{"text":"I like this place for their happy hour specials. It is a fun spot to meet up with the girls before or after running errands. 

It is definitely cozy, and I have seen several people there on what appear to be dates. The room is more lounge-like than dining room so it offers great people watching. My friends and I liked to speculate on the conversation topics and relationship dynamics of the couples. I am 100% sure we witnessed at least one bad match.com first date. 

I say, meet up with your girlfriends, or take your girlfriend for a cozy evening out."}
{"text":"Stopped in this past Saturday for an afternoon bite to eat. The outdoor patio area is nice, but around 4pm was completely shaded on a sunny day. It wasn't busy but service was scattered, may have been during a shift change. The Baked Brie came in a hollowed out French baguette...yum! Also ordered the breaded artichokes and they were good. I'd return again; I saw other menu items that intrigued me."}
{"text":"My mother and I spontaneously decided to stop here for some wine and cheese and we were very pleasantly surprised.

Although it's located in the middle of Crocker Park, 87 West has managed to create a peaceful ambience. Upon walking in there are signs indicating for you to \"make yourself comfortable\". I personally love choosing my own seat so this was very nice! There are several styles of seating - from couches by the windows, to restaurant style tables, to patio furniture outside. 

Once we seated ourselves, our server promptly came over with cucumber water (LOVE) and gave us a few minutes to look over the menu. It also happened to be happy hour and she told us all about the specials. She was so friendly, attentive, and sweet. My mother ordered the white sangria and I got their Chardonnay of the day - both were phenomenal. We also chose to get a cheese plate to share and it was AMAZING. I couldn't have handpicked the selections of cheeses better if I tried. We got 4 cheeses, fig jam, fresh strawberries,  dried apricots, toasted hazelnuts, and baguettes. It was one of the best cheese boards I've ever had! 

But the absolute star of the night were the post-wine and cheese martinis that we both ordered. My mother got a chocolate truffle martinis and I did the double espresso martini. She loved hers and mine was AMAZING. I wasn't expecting a wine bar to have such tasty dessert martinis but I would honestly come back just for those. SO good, I highly recommend trying it! 


All in all I will definitely be back. I love the casual and relaxing ambience. The service was impeccable and our drinks and cheese plate were amazing!"}
{"text":"We enjoy the Sunday all day happy hour.  87 West has good seasonal drink options as well as sangria, standard wine and beer options.  The appetizers are good - tuna nachos, flatbread pizzas, tater tots, cheese, and dips.  The atmosphere is very nice, but a lot of the tables have uncomfortable seats for eating.  We have also attend one of their monthly wine tasting dinners.  We highly recommend this!  It is a great price for 4-5 courses with wine pairings."}
{"text":"Yum ! Great food and service !! The food is very well prepared and the attention to detail is evident of a chef that cares. Live music tonight also."}
{"text":"The lobster tacos were tasty so was the cheese platter and the tuna tartare was nice with avocado, we sat on the patio the services was pretty slow I had to ask for silverware and napkins after the second plate was brought out, and had to go in to get the check because they didn't come back to check on us. Good food slow service"}
{"text":"I see negative reviews for this place. With all my due respect, some people are looking for salty, cheesy plates; then go to Chilli! This is more refined, small bites place with excellent wine for the few $ you pay! The tuna tartar is probably the best in town. And the green house salad and mushroom flatbread are excellent. You sit where you want; fire place ... And great casual couch seating! In the summer, great outside seating. I'm disappointed when I go and Jacqueline (server) isn't there as she pours her heart out. For a foody like me, this place is perfect for a Saturday mid-day stop and Sunday all day happy hour. Keep it up guys!!"}
{"text":"Visited this wine bar Friday night when a woman was singing and playing guitar.  She sounded just like Joni Mitchell.  It was a genuine pleasure listening to her.

Our waitress was very sweet and personable.  The Benzinger Sauvignon blanc was crisp and light.  The guacamole was creamy with just the right amount of salt and tomatoes.  The baked Brie with baguette, fig sauce and almonds was sublime.  Loved the high ceilings and walls of windows."}
{"text":"First time at 87 west was this past weekend. Very good experience. Great patio. Very good service. 

We split the bruschetta to start which was very good. My wife had the cheese plate as her main dish which was very good according to her. I had the strawberry goat cheese salad (87 west salad) which was equally delicious. 

Very good beer selection and of course wine :)

Very happy with and will be returning - likely this week!!"}
{"text":"I wasn't too terribly impressed with this place.  The inside is classy yet comfortable, and even when every table is full, the noise-level remains moderate enough to enjoy conversation with your companions.  Based on atmosphere alone, 87 West is worth visiting.  However, I found the wine selection to be lacking.  When I go to a wine bar, I expect to be nearly overwhelmed by the number of choices.  Here, I was rather underwhelmed.  In my search for a sweet white wine, I was left empty-handed.  I asked our waitress for her opinion, and agreed to her selection, only to find that my wine was not sweet at all.  I wasted $7 on a tiny glass of wine I didn't even enjoy.  My boyfriend fared better in his search for a spicy red wine, but was none too pleased that it was $9 for the two-ounce pour.

I found the martini selection to be more appealing, but sadly overpriced at nearly $10 each.  At that price point, I'd much rather go to the VTR for a martini of superior quality.

They did have three martini specials at $5 each, but when I attempted to order one, the waitress informed me they were all out.  Really?  Then maybe you should take it off your specials list."}
{"text":"Love this Place, Perfect atmosphere!! Would love to live and or Work at Crocker Pk just to get the discount(it can get $$$) and be nearby.Really enjoy the small plates the variety of munchies makes you want to keep ordering wine and try one dish after another. Lobster pizza and the dip trio are my favorites."}
{"text":"Love the all-day Happy Hour on Sundays.  My hubby and I have been here numerous times and have always had a wonderful experience. The food and drinks (especially Ahi Poke Nachos) are phenomenal!!!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for brunch with friends a while ago but held off on a review because I didn't know if they just had an off day with their food.  The mimosas were awesome.  But after my next time in during happy hour I felt the same way.  The food was not as great as the menu description but the drinks were super tasty.  I would definitely go back for drinks but grab a bite to eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"Amazing wine bar with a very comfortable for conversation atmosphere. Our waiter was super nice and did not rush us and they do close late, so perfect for chilling on a Saturday night. They parking garage is just next to it, so if you just want to stop for a drink, go for it! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Tonight, we went to 87 West for their 5 course food/wine pairing and it was amazingly delicious along with being a great deal.

The 5 courses were as follows:

1. Ahi Tuna with eel sauce and scallions on crispy chip paired with a sparkling riesling.

This was delicious. If it had been a snack on a party platter, I would've finished the whole platter by myself! The raw tuna tasted very fresh with the scallions and the eel sauce gave it sweetness that went great with the crispiness of the chip. 

2. Butternut squash bisque with granny smith apple paired with a chardonnay.

My favorite dish of the night. It was sweet with a slight nutmeg taste to it and it just tasted delicious. I enjoyed every bite of savory goodness.

3. Porchetta and potatoes with gorgonzola cheese paired with a combo red.

The fatty meat with the crispy skin was delicious, although more toward the center, the meat was dry. The potatoes were also awesome especially with the melt in your mouth cheese.

4. Stuffed shells with a meat sauce and spinach paired with a cabernet savignon.

This is was probably my least favorite dish of the night but it was still tasty. The red meat sauce had some spiciness to it that made it all the better, but compared to the other dishes, I felt it needed work.

5. Chocolate tart with black pepper (Yes! black pepper!) ice cream paired with a port.

This dessert was something different and in a good way. The chocolate tart had a dark chocolate cream/ganache on top with a crunchy chocolate cookie on the bottom. The black pepper ice cream was pretty much regular vanilla with pepper/salt sprinked over it which actually went over quite well.

All of this came for $35 a person! I know this isn't the normal menu, but I asked the server if this chef was the regular and he told me it was, so if that is the case, I would DEFINITELY come back to try what else he has to offer. Wonderful dinner and quite the deal too."}
{"text":"I've passed by this place many times, and always chose somewhere else because I was under the assumption that it was expensive, the food portions are small (I like my Americanized, completely inappropriately large portions), and a little too pretentious...

 Firstly, five stars for atmosphere. I love the lounge type seating, complete with tables and chairs, comfy couch and lounge chair seating areas, a bar area, and charming outdoor patio. Big windows in a simple two by two space with wood and stainless steel elements make this place perfect for a lengthy convo or date night.

 Service was lacking. Although the two women who were serving were very friendly, I couldn't help but feel that I was neglected throughout the entire dinner (at every step in the serving process there was a long pause, especially in between being finished with my meal and receiving my check). The patio was full, but I was the only one sitting inside (as a one top) and just couldn't help but feel like an afterthought. 

Lastly, the food was just \"okay\" and lived up to my assumptions that it was 1. too small 2. too expensive, therefore not being of very much value. 

Skip the lobster tacos, but the loaded tots were okay as an appetizer. Come during a happy hour, or Sunday as their happy hour is all day. I may be back to try the other plates, but I just don't see myself rushing back anytime soon. I think this place is great for dates, drinks, or meetings as more of a novelty place, but not so much as a regular place to dine."}
{"text":"Visited this place on a whim on the last day we were in town, as the Yelp reviews seemed great. The place itself is really pretty, very comfortable and we even had the option to sit at a couch with low tables. We sat ourselves at a small regular table and were quickly greeted by a waitress and she brought us waters almost immediately. 

We ordered the calamari, the potstickers, and of course the lobster nachos. They took a while to come out, but our waitress always came back to check in on us and tell us it shouldn't be much longer. 

The food was all excellent, with the postickers being my boyfriend's favorite and the lobster nachos being mine but the calamari was still amazing!

Service was really good too, the waitress mistakenly gave us a dirty small plate and caught herself quickly and brought out a new clean plate as soon as she found out."}
{"text":"While the fireplace and patio at this place are super cute, the food and drink leave some to be desired.

Food: Tator tots are good. Portions can be small..
Drinks: Beer is overpriced...So are the mixed drinks unless you go during happy hour or a weekly special. I wish beer was more reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Home of the Jihad!  Stay away, I'm sure there is a dirty bomb somewhere in that place."}
{"text":"Shopping is so much more fun when I stop in here! I've stopped in a couple times and had great food and drinks with friendly service for pretty good prices. The meat and cheese board and the flatbreads are really good, the one flatbread I really liked was a special but the mushroom is good too. They have a large tv over a fireplace and some small circular booths perfect for two people. A cold glass of white wine when it's hot out and you can take a break from shopping and just people watch and keep ordering small plates, what's not to like."}
{"text":"I was super excited to go here because I love Crocker Park and wine bars, I went for one happy hour and once after a movie and had two completely different experiences.

The happy hour food menu is definitely lacking. Compared to their regular menu which is full of great options, it's just boring. The food is cold and lacks imagination that you see in the regular menu. The service was super slow and not attentive at all. 

When I went after the movie it was great. Good service, constantly bringing us more wine and suggesting wines to try and the food menu is fun and delicious. 

It's a cool atmosphere and has tons of potential. 

It's too bad they can't get their happy hour together."}
{"text":"Stopped in here early on a Saturday evening after seeing a matinee.  A bit of an odd location (right in the middle of the street at Crocker Park), but that seemed to lend well to the feeling of the place.  With a group of 4, although crowded, we were easily able to rearrange some comfy chairs and tables to accommodate our group.  We all agreed it had somewhat of a comfy ski lodge feel, but looked as if it could convert to a great airy space in the summer, with huge windows that slide open and an attached patio.  We opted to do the wine tasting choice, where you load up a card with $ and then help yourself to different prices of 2 ounce pours of red or white (between $3.75 - $12.50 per pour, deducted from your card).  We also ordered 4 small and large plates to share: spinach & crab dip, chorizo sliders, calamari and pulled pork nachos.  Although everything here is on the pricey side, all of the food was delicious!  These 4 appetizers were the perfect amount of \"dinner\" for the 4 of us to share after binging on popcorn at a movie.  The service was great; everyone there was very friendly, accommodating and aware.  Our server in particular was very good and had a great attitude.  He helped set us up with the wine tasting and checked back just enough that we did not feel bothered but could find him easily if needed.  Overall, it was a great experience; the only downside being the pricing - but I guess that's to be expected at Crocker Park!  I will definitely go back for a cozy evening with friends or a significant other.

Update 6/4/12: 
Recently went back with a girl friend for an afternoon glass of wine after a manicure across the street at Anthony Vince. There was a new menu, and the wine tasting machine was no longer available. However, everything was just as delicious as the first time, and Saturday's 12-4pm happy hour was very affordable! The beef sliders came with thin and crunchy onion straws, the tater tots were perfectly seasoned and salty, and the flat bread of the day was some of the best I've had. Furthermore, since we were the only ones in the place, the cute server was very attentive and friendly :-) I highly recommend a relaxing Saturday afternoon spent here enjoying time with friends."}
{"text":"87 West is perfect for an evening of conversations with friends. I have a great wine selection, their foods are ample and delicious, and their service team are exemplary. Courtney made sure we were well taken care of and shared special opportunities for us to experience different wines. The manager also regularly stopped by to just make sure we were having a good evening. I highly recommend 87 West and I will definitely be back again soon."}
{"text":"This is my all time favorite place in Cleveland to get a drink. It is so sexy and definitely swanky! Food is great, especially the tapas. Love the wine and cocktails, some of the best in town. Outdoor patio with heat lamps is awesome. I definitely recommend coming here! Classy and hip place. You won't find any drunk fools here like you see in the warehouse district."}
{"text":"Great for drinks and socializing and light food."}
{"text":"Unbelievable deal on Thursday nights - 2 meals for $40! Let me explain...this included a bottle of Canyon Ridge Cabernet, Tuna tartare appetizer (which was delicious!), an order of the most scrumptious beef stroganoff AND a chorizo flatbread pizza, finishing with the fondue I have pictures! The fondue had fresh fruit, pound cake, and these divine \"s'more\" bites (graham crackers with scorched marsh mellows for dunking).  The value is unbelievable! We will be regulars here for date night."}
{"text":"this place is pretty cool, right in the middle of crocker park.  stopped in during the afternoon for happy hour...tried the ahi tuna nachos, chicken egg rolls and drinks.

food was flavorful but nothing out of the ordinary.  drinks were kind of watered down. 

what really miffed me was that as a few more patrons came in, we got forgotten about.  i didn't think it would be that difficult to check in on us.  it sucks because i really wanted to try the lobster mac & cheese.  therefore, when our server came back, we just requested the check.

it's a shame too because the place is really cozy, but the service left a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"I've only been once, but they had me at cheesy bacon tots. The wine selection was great and the atmosphere was chic yet comfy. With nice couches and plush pillows everywhere. Definitely a date night spot. (hint hint ;)"}
{"text":"I've been to this wine bar twice in the past two weeks. The first time, I made it for happy hour where they have $4 glasses of house wine and $4 small bits (hummus, guacamole, spicy spring rolls, flatbread, olives, cheese, and pommes frites). The pommes frites (french fries) were some of my all-time favorite.  They were cooked perfectly and served with a yummy sauce on the side.  The hummus was good, nothing to write home about. The spicy chicken egg rolls were very good and the sweet and sour sauce that came with them was very good! 

The second time, I went for trivia on a Tuesday night...so much fun!! We split a bottle of wine with our group and shared one of the chocolate mousse desserts; very good! 

I love the atmosphere here.  They have a large stone fireplace and being here makes you feel like you are in a cabin in the woods.  I definitely recommend trying their trivia for something fun to do on a Tuesday night."}
{"text":"Nice and cozy place, the menu is very limited but everything we have tried has been amazing.  We have sat both inside and outside by the fire and it's a very comfortable place.  Happy hour has some really good deals, and you should always ask about the specials for the day.  We have a flat bread pizza that was amazing it had strawberries on it!  Never would of thought strawberries on a flatbread pizza would be good but it was!  Great place to go after work and we will be be back"}
{"text":"I have come to 87 west a few times.  The atmosphere is nice and they have a great patio for the summer.  This is a great spot for a glass of wine and a short stop during your next trip to Crocker Park"}
{"text":"I am confirming this place as a 4-star establishment based on the group event we had there this evening. The service was good and friendly, the ambiance was pleasant, and the appetizers we all had were delicious. In particular I liked the chorizo and potato flatbread and the calamari. But best of all was the great company of my good co-workers, friends and newbie Yelpers!"}
{"text":"Hey Hollywood!  Yep that's the feeling I got when I sat down and ordered a very delicious sparkling wine.  This place is super cute, super affordable, and the perfect place to meet your significant other (no worries about them not being a booze hound like you) 

Seriously I am in love with 87 West, the fun of trying different wines, getting cucumber water (yummo!), and enjoying some fun small plates makes for a great evening!"}
{"text":"popped into 87 west for a drink around 11. our waitress promptly greeted us with cucumber waters (fancy!) and we ordered a few glasses of wine plus a beer. prices were a little on the steep side. a few minutes later, complementary pumpkin pudding spoons came out from the kitchen. another nice touch. sadly, we didn't get to stay long since last call was about 10 minutes after we arrived.

as for the space itself, it felt cramped, instead of cozy. they're trying to pull off a high end wine bar look and feel, but the tables and chairs looked cheap. besides the furniture, the rest of the restaurant felt like it was having an identity crisis. they had a fireplace and a modern chandelier, but the back wall was covered with weird, distracting art - a bunch of huge, plastic symbols (one being a no smoking sign.) didn't seem to fit in with everything else that was going on.

i liked where 87 west was going; they just didn't make it there for me."}
{"text":"Very cute bistro in Crocker Park.  Across from
dicks sporting goods.  The indoor and outdoor fireplaces are very nice.  I only tried a few items - vegetarian tacos and the bruschetta both were good.  They have all day Happy Hour on Sundays with flatbreads only 6$ and small plates 3-5$.  Yelp had a check in offer for buy one small plate get the other free.  Cocktails were about 5$.  This os a great addition to the commercial area full mostly chains.  I'm already looking forward to my next trip!"}
{"text":"I wanted to get one last glass of wine before leaving to go home for the night with my boyfriend. So when I saw the wine bar by the Apple store, it was a no-brainer. Walking in, I saw a sign instructing us to seat ourselves. The decor was really nice, dim lighting with high wooden ceilings. It was relaxing and cozy and I was super excited to snag a couch in the far corner of the room. We sat down and our waitress, a girl with long straight dark hair, came to give us our menus, she asked if we saw a checkbook lying around the couch or tables and we all took a quick look around and couldn't find anything. She left so we could peruse the menu. Since I just wanted a drink, I picked one out fairly quickly. My boyfriend doesn't drink so he was quite happy with the surprisingly delicious cucumber water. 

When our waitress came back, I ordered my drink. She had this expression on her face that made me feel uncomfortable, as if she was annoyed with me for only ordering a drink and nothing else. I have a pet peeve about that sort of thing, and seeing that the restaurant was not crowded in the least bit- there were several empty tables- it wasn't like I was \"stealing\" a table from a potential big spender who'd would have to give her a big tip. So already, my visit had an awkward start. 

Feeling unnerved, I felt like I had to order something to appease our waitress so I ordered some Old School Tots when she came back with my drink. I wasn't hungry in the least bit and was in no mood to order a $10 appetizer so yes, I ordered the lowest priced vegetarian option I could find. She gave me the same annoyed expression and this time, my boyfriend noticed there was some subtle hostility. Then, a couple other waiters and I think, the general manager, came back over to us three separate times trying to find the missing check book. At one point, my boyfriend was on the floor using a flashlight on his iPhone to help look, and no one apologized for disrupting our night. I felt bad about the missing check book, we had not seen it at all during our entire visit, but the lack of communication between all the servers was seriously getting on our nerves by then. At one point, I had wondered if they thought that WE had taken the check book.

Not surprisingly, our waitress had completely forgotten to bring us our appetizer. The whole night, we could clearly see her over by the kitchen chatting with one of the guys behind the kitchen counter and ignoring us. By the time she finally came over to ask us if \"everything was okay,\" it had been 30 minutes, my wine was nearly gone and I had given up on the tots. We just asked for the check only to be kept waiting for another 20 minutes. Finally, she came close to our table to clean up someone else's table and my boyfriend had to call across to her for the check a second time. We wasted no time paying and getting the heck out of there.

I was very disappointed because the wine bar seemed like it had a lot of potential. I know the main problem was the service, so I do plan on coming back another time and giving it another chance with a different server."}
{"text":"Kept hearing things about this wine bar in Crocker Park, so decided to take my girlfriend out and finally check this place out!  We were both pleasantly surprised by this place.  The wines were great and the service was awesome.  Our server Hannah (assuming that is the correct spelling) was pleasant and was very attentive, she suggested a wine from Chile that was extraordinary.  The food was excellent, we ordered some light snack type foods.  Needless to say we will be coming back again really soon.  The place looks like it may get busy, be patient an wait for a seat to open up, trust me it will be well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Went here recently with some friends from high school on a warm Thursday evening around 9:30pm and it was PACKED...must have been the movie in the park but it was ridiculous! 

The waitress did not understand us and she seemed really out of it, plus she didn't even separate out checks. I really like the idea of this place and I am always excited for it, but then when I get there, it's just not a great time."}
{"text":"Perfect place to drink your sorrows away after spending way  too much money at DSW across the street. 
I love the atmosphere of the place  and the fact that a slice of cucumber is floating in my water - very refreshing! (makes me feel like such a sophisticated grown-up!).
However the service of the place usually fluctuates from average to terrible, they know almost nothing about the wines they serve and they shamelessly dilute cocktails during happy hour. 
Other than that I really dig this new urban breed - wine bar/coffee shop."}
{"text":"Great options for food. Food tasted great. Portions were small plate worthy and not too small. Got the tater tots, egg rolls, lobster nachos, cheese plate and vegetable fajita tacos. We left full but not crazy stuffed. Definitely recommend going on a Sunday during all day happy hour for select food and drinks."}
{"text":"Nice stop for a martini, and even extra nice that it was Monday and they are only $6.   The chocolate truffle and the double espresso were both excellent choices.  Often times bars water down drinks on special, but not this one.  We also had the small cheese plate which was presented very well and was a nice accompaniment with the drinks.

Service was exceptional, which can truly make or break an experience.

The outdoor seating is very nice, but as it was 85 degrees, the fireplace was a bit much.   Maybe later in the evening when it cools down, but early on, it only added to the already hot air.

Definitely will return to this little gem of a place."}
{"text":"Unimpressed. Food was not very good. I had the prosciutto & pea Mac & cheese (as did 2/3 people I was with). Each of us said the same thing-- too many breadcrumbs. Told the manager, usually they say something along the lines of \"can we take it off your bill, seeing as you took 2 bites and literally can't stand it, or can we get you something else\". All they said was \"thanks for your feedback, we will take it into consideration for next time\". Cool. They did send out complimentary dessert fondue at the end of our meal, but still. It was a nice gesture, but I still paid $16 for a meal I hated. The waitress forgot my wine, and came back asking if I knew what I wanted to drink 25 mins later. At that point I was just done. 

The decor was nice. Server was kind, but a tad air-headed.  

I would not come back for the food, but I could imagine stopping in for a glass of wine (preferably during a happy hour)."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a snowy Saturday to grabs some drinks with friends to celebrate a friend's birthday. Since it was during the holiday season, Crocker Park was PACKED. And so was 87 West 2. I'd never been there before, and it's pretty small on the inside so we had to steal some chairs and tables (think living room furniture) to have enough seats. 

The wine list was solid and they had a decent selection of beer, too. They have a small food menu that we ordered off off. They were able to veganize the bruchetta for me and I had some olives, but otherwise, there weren't many options for me. Others in my party had flatbreads and said they were good. Service was really spotty, though. We were hungry and thirsty the whole time. Our waitress was within sight rolling silverware, but she didn't check on us as often as she should have. (we definitely would have spent a lot more and ordered a lot more if she had)

I think this is a great place to go for a date night or to grab a drink with a friend, but if you're part of a large party? I'd go elsewhere. They're just not set up to handle a large group."}
{"text":"I've visited 87 West a few times over the years and recently returned for a light lunch with my family. We were shopping and catching a movie at Crocker Park so this was a convenient option for us. The location is central to the shopping center, located in the middle of the grassy area near the splash pad and Dick's Sporting Goods. 

The ambiance of the restaurant was nice. The entire restaurant is surrounded by windows so on a nice day it's sunny and airy. There is also an outdoor patio for those that do want to dine in the fresh air. Seating includes a variety of tables and comfortable seating areas with booths and chairs. 

A few of us enjoyed wine while the rest opted for beer. I chose a glass of white wine from a Washington winery that was really good. My mom and sister-in-law went with the seasonal red and they both enjoyed it. I like that they offer beer for those that prefer beer to wine.

We shared the Cheese & Salumi Plate, Bruschetta, and Baked Brie. All three were delicious and perfect for sharing. The Cheese & Salumi plate had a nice amount of cheese and meat on the board with some jam and nuts for variety. Everything on the board was delicious. The Baked Brie was good, but it would have been even better if the fig preserve had been over the entire piece of bread instead of just on one corner. The Bruschetta was a twist on the traditional bruschetta, but was very good. There was plenty of the topping to be spread on the toasted bread that was covered in balsamic. My brother enjoyed his Crispy Chicken Sliders and the tots on the side were really good.

There was only one server the day we visited, but she didn't miss a thing. We were well taken care of and didn't have a long wait for food."}
{"text":"Cool interior with cheap prices for fancy food!  The chorizo Flatbread was great and the crab cakes were out of bounds. G-R-8 times at 87!!"}
{"text":"A great, comfortable place to have a glass of wine and some tasty food. The wine list is generous, and the food is good. The lobster nachos are reminiscent of a deconstructed crab rangoon, the strawberry balsamic flatbread is bright and delicious, and the cheese plates are adequate but nothing special. 

My only downside is that it's directly inside Crocker Park. Shoppers, loiterers, and people everywhere, and it won't slow down until well into the evening."}
{"text":"A cozy and comfortable atmosphere! Good selection of wine and light bites to eat. Only giving 4 stars because it is quite expensive for the quality, in my opinion."}
{"text":"This place is kind of like Crocker Park itself -- it's mostly overpriced and I always feel a bit embarrassed to be there, but it's pretty nice and I always find myself back there at some point. Their happy hour specials are reasonable, and the food is decent. It's a nice way to while away some time before a movie or while waiting on somebody. Not a destination, but not an unpleasant place to be either."}
{"text":"Our time here felt like it was an inconvenience. Our waitress was disinterested and inattentive. We will never return."}
{"text":"A-OK indeed!
I love that there's a cute independent restaurant in the heart of Crocker. It was a nice place to swing by for small plates and a glass o' vino. 

The atmosphere is very loungey and chic, and the service behaves accordingly (i.e., if you're not the loungey type, don't eat at a lounge). The menu was small plates/tapas-style, and therefore lends itself to budget dining, if that's what you want.

We had the cheese fondue for our meal and the choco fondue for dessert. Portions were a  little stingey to say the least, but was okay for the price. 

It's a cute place to swing by to slow down during Xmas shopping, but nothing that knocked my socks off. Maybe we'll be back to try another small plate this holiday season."}
{"text":"Was not impressed. The menu was small, which I at first thought was fine since it was a wine bar like place. However, with the four things we ordered, the only thing that was decent was the guac which was just basic. The drinks were just okay, I did ask for more gin in the wine and gin drink we ordered, which they added, but for pice, selection and overall atmosphere it wasn't a desirable spot."}
{"text":"This place used to be so much better when they had the enomatic machine. The place feels worn down and dirty now. Such a bummer. Like the other wine bars on this side of town, I wish they offered flights, but didn't."}
{"text":"87 West is awesome!  The decor and fireplace create a hip and cozy atmosphere.  I have been here twice now and everything has been delicious!  My favorite dishes:

the grilled four cheese - so many yummy cheeses and melted perfectly
the chorizo flatbread - super delish, perfect combination of toppings
the baked brie - love the combination of brie and sweet compote 
the carbonara - really good carbonara sauce, my only wish is that it had pancetta instead of chicken an bacon

The wine list and wait staff also added to the awesomeness.  Our waitress was super friendly, nice and good at her job. I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"This place makes me feel like I'm on vacation.  

From the warm, toasty fire roaring and the flame-colored light fixtures hanging from the ceiling, it just exudes coziness.  Add to that the warm hues of wine and mixed drinks as they \"chin-chin\" in customers' hands, and you've got a great setting for a night out.  This is a place for sharing, and nothing tastes better than their appetizers and plates meant for passing around the table while you're here with friends.  

Visit during this time of year and you can't help but be caught up in the festive atmosphere of Crocker Park during the holidays.  Christmas lights span the streets and the Christmas tree in the roundabout makes me look over my shoulder and make sure the Polar Express isn't about to stop here with a load of kiddos happy to see Santa.  

I'll be returning here, hopefully with both old and new friends in tow so we can all enjoy the vacation from reality that 87 West in Crocker Park affords!"}
{"text":"The restaurant and service is great, but the food isn't very good. There are not very many options. It is a good place to grab an appetizer and a drink, but do not take the family here for dinner. It is cool when they put the Cavs or Indians game up on the big screen and 87 West's patio is right there. You cannot bring drinks onto the lawn to watch the games, but you can just drink at 87 West!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere incredible, service, good, wine and drink menu, great. 

Ordered tater tots, fantastic but who doesn't like tater tots? They were fantastic!
Ordered s'mores, what a rip off! Smeared chocolate two large marshmallows with not even two full graham crackers! Had to ask for more since they were gone with just half of one marshmallow! $8! At least give more chocolate and crackers. Are they supposed to be warm too? At least growing up they were. Note to self: never get them again!

Server was good, as in friendly! But SLOW as all get out. 25 minutes to wait for one drink is a tad unacceptable! But of course it was charged, should have been comp'ed. 
Instead of having customers that are paying wait so long for a drink, they seemed more concerned with filling water glasses with all patrons. 

We will be back, just not ordering deserts! And we will be sure we are in NO hurry!"}
{"text":"I received a gift card for 87 West 2 for Christmas, and I was skeptical because it's a wine bar in the middle of Crocker Park. So in normal Kristen fashion, I dragged my boyfriend there for happy hour and was pleasantly surprised! They have $4 pours of wine from 2-6 during the week, the pours are very generous! I stuck with a pinot and have no complaints, they also offer a happy hour food menu, but I consider it to be very lacking compared to other happy hours around. Although, their pomme frites struck my fancy! Happy hour portions are small but the malt vinegar aioli that came with the frites were to die for.

We also tried to the calamari which was decent, but not memorable. But I would like to pull your attention to the lobster nachos! Get these!! $15 for a decent plate of nachos doused in a lobster cream sauce with huge chunks of lobster and hand mashed guacamole. So rich, so worth it!! 

I would go back to 87 West 2, but probably only for happy hour!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Westlake. We frequent this place often and that is because it's so amazing. It's so cozy with the indoor/outdoor fireplace and the couches. The service is always perfect here, never have to wait or deal with rude servers. The drinks are so good and the food is even better. I love the all day happy hour on Sunday, I think it's a great touch. 

I cannot wait to go back to this place!"}
{"text":"All day Sunday happy hour? Sure, why not!

My Opentable gift card + a search of open restaurants on a Sunday night, led us to 87 West 2. All day happy hour? Sure, why not!

Located in the middle of Crocker Park (literally, it's right next to the shopping), we were surprised we had overlooked this restaurant before. Since it was all day happy hour, we ordered off their menu:

- Ahi tuna nachos- eh, this was alright. There wasn't much fish on the nachos, and it had a tiny bit of sauce over crispy chips..... yeah, it was just ok. Nothing to rave about.

- Pork belly buns- these were alright! Not sure if I was really a fan of the sriracha aioli, but it was ok. The bun was done well though.

- Fajita vegetarian tacos- also, just ok. Nothing outstanding.

- We also ordered the margherita flatbread. I feel like I've had much better flatbreads, but it filled us up.

Also, the service was really slow. Like really slow- I think they only had one server that night. The atmosphere of this restaurant is rather cute- there's a cozy fireplace outside, and it's filled with couches and small tables on the inside. The food isn't anything to rave about though- so, if you're just looking for somewhere where you can rest from shopping and get a quick bite of something, I'm sure this place would be suitable for you."}
{"text":"We ordered lobster tacos, tots, baked Brie for starters all taste pretty good. Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"It's winter.  Time for snuggling up with the one you love and enjoying the quiet pleasures of the season.  And it's cold, so the snuggling thing works on that level, as well.  87 W 2 is a nice place to keep warm and .. well yeah.. snuggle.  That is the word for the day.

THE ATMOSPHERE:  Modern Chalet.  The soaring space is done up in a relaxing mix of medium woods, soothing browns and ambers.  The interesting chandeliers and the fireplace give the place a warm, earthy, cozy glow.  There are couches and banquettes for snuggling accompanied by a few unwieldy little tables. Snuggly!

THE WINE:  Buy a specal debit card, slip it into R-2 V-no, select a wine, receive a 2oz. tasting.  OK, I get it-- try new wines.  But darlings, at least TRY to have an interesting selection.  Most of the wines in R-2 were dull and unimpressive  and rather pricey for a 2oz pour.  Lots of boring single note merlots.  A wimpy French melange with absolutely no body.  A very young Spanish that was nowhere near ready to drink. People were oohing and ahhing over the Opus One at $12 a pour for the mere fact that it was $12 a pour.

It was fun trying new wines that I would ordinarily pass by when buying by the bottle BUT the sommelier should try to inform, enlighten and challenge.  People who try this system are looking for new experiences, not little sips of disappointing little dinner wines. 

THE FOOD:  Innovative and fun.  The wines should be this interesting.  The calamari were tender and encrusted in panko breadcrumbs.  The stand out was the sauce-- a chili infused vinegar that cut through the fried preparation and added a lot of interest.   The lobster nachos were tasty-- if a bit drenched in the lemon aoili.  There were giant heaps of lobster claw meat nestled (snuggled!) throughout.  The cheese plate was good but a bit silly-- they put the cheese on the crackers for you.  The standard selection of brie, bleue, smoked cheddar and gouda was accompanied by a mango cherry chutney and some lovely spiced nuts.  

THE SERVICE:  Our waitress was very helpful, informed and pleasant.  She really anticipated and met all our needs-- and left us alone later to snuggle a bit  and enjoy our wines.  Very intuative."}
{"text":"Maybe it's just me, but I got a definite older middle-age meat-market vibe from this place, that brought to mind tales of Westlake's Viagra Triangle.

That's not to say it was awful, just sort of strange.  I take that back, this is exactly what I would expect a wine bar at Crocker Park to be like.  The decor comes off as trying a little to hard to be hip which makes it feel a little inauthentic.  The international symbol heiroglyphs on the wall were perplexing, and the squat stools to sit on across from the sofa-booths around the edges of the room were a little awkward and uncomfortable.  

On the positive side of things, the service was very friendly and attentive.  Empty plates were cleared promptly and our glasses were rarely low or empty for long despite it being a somewhat busy friday night. 

The place isn't set up for heavy duty dining, so I can understand the emphasis on small plates.  That being said, of the several dishes tried at our table(s) all were good, but none seemed to distinguish themselves as special.  Couple this with most items being on the pricy side for what they are and the food was a little bit of a let down.  

I don't drink, so I can't speak to that element of 87 West 2, and as it's a framed as a wine bar it's entirely possible that I missed out on the best they have to offer.  I would not be upset if I wound up here again, but I don't know that I would go out of my way to make it back.  I'd also like to give them props for their monthly foodie nights done in collaboration with the Culinary Vegetable Institute."}
{"text":"All day happy hour on Sunday - that's nice. I ordered crab hush puppies - pretty good, one was burnt. Decent selection of wine. Waitress was quick/friendly. Actual wine bar is cozy with a fireplace. I will be back, nice little place to stop for a break from shopping and the cold."}
{"text":"Truly a lovely place to be at! Great food super nice wine selection. And the bar tender Alexander helped us with Knowledgeable wine picks. He is a funny guy. Can't wait to go back again"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a glass of wine with a colleague. Nice place, we were able to put our feet up. Man, o'man, do I like putting my feet up! As fancy and nice as the place looks and feels, when you have your feet up all is good and comfy. The big fireplace added to the warmth of the place. 

I didn't eat there, but my friend swears the food is quite tasty. I know the wine was...."}
{"text":"This small wine bar looks cozy from the outside looking in, and once inside much of the visual warmth is maintained. The place was really busy on the Monday we went owing to lady's night drink specials. Despite this, there were only 2 staff members working the bar/dining room. 

Service was friendly. The kitchen however was slow. The mains we ordered were a bit dry (salmon) and lacked presentation (pasta). The muscle appetiser was very strange in that there was a little bit of sauce under the muscle shells and on the muscles shells which is completely useless. Needless to say the muscles themselves were a bit dry as well. Perhaps this is a place to go only for small plates (aside from the muscles) and snacks and not large entrees. 

Even with ordering an appetiser, 2 mains and a dessert the length of the dinner service was really unacceptable. I like the vibe of this place so I'd return for a glass of wine and perhaps an appetizer, but definitely not for mains."}
{"text":"Food was good, but it messed with my friend and I's stomach later that night. Our waitress was not good. She wasn't attentive to any of her tables and we had to ask to order things versus her coming and asking if we wanted to order food. The decor was cute and we loved that the windows open up. 1 more downside is that there is only 1 bathroom for women and 1 for men."}
{"text":"Super tasty happy hour, (food & drinks) w great prices! 2-6:30 M-F, Sat 12-4 and all day on Sunday. Karineen was very nice and helpful! Def will be back!"}
{"text":"So, the idea of a wine tasting bar sounded pretty cool and the atmosphere is incredible - California Winecountry  meets the Pacific Northwest.

Sadly, I was more than disappointed. Our waiter left a little to be desired, forgetting what we ordered and giving us incorrect checks.

The wine tasting bar was the biggest disappointment. The idea is to use a card system to dispense 2oz. glasses of various wines, giving you a larger variety of wines to try.

Of the 12 or so red wines, there 6 Cabs, 3 Pinots and a few odds and ends... with no Merlots at all. Each wine tasted watered down and ultimately were poor in flavor and quality.

The clientele seemed to be drinking more beer and cocktails than anything else and I was one of maybe a handful of people using the tasting machine.

High marks for atmosphere and concept, but the execution was severely lacking."}
