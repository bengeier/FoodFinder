{"text":"Bad! Chicken tacos,el pollo salado ,tacos caros,las salsas verde y roja,sin sabor,,sorry pero no estan tan sabrosos ,como supuestamente anuncian"}
{"text":"I had the shrimp salad and really enjoyed the fresh lettuce, tomatoes, & beans. The grilled peppers & onions were a nice touch. The shrimp was very good, I wished there were more in my salad. The cilantro sauce was good. It was VERY fresh."}
{"text":"Tried this place a few times and it has not disappointed! The frescas are amazing as well as the food! The price is a little high but it's all fresh and in my opinion worth it."}
{"text":"The food was sooooo good as well as the frescas. The customer service was great & fast. I'm so full I'm on my ass right now"}
{"text":"Absolutamente lo mejor en comida mexica en estos tiempos  La carne asada tiene un sabor único fresco y casero lo mismo el pastor y el pollo todo en general me encanto los burritos tacos cócteles y quesadillas de camarón woow exquisitos!!! Desde el servicio la limpieza y por su puesto la comida mmmm DELISIOSO Y FRESCO   Les quedo muy pero muy bonito en verdad felicidades!!! Aparte de moderno y diferente a cualkier otro restaurante mexicano  Muy amables y atentos se ve que en verdad saben tratar al cliente porque enseguida te ofrecen las pruebas de aguas frescas y son lo máximo en verdad frescas y naturales que es aún mejor   Absolutamente lo recomiendo  Great job guys"}
{"text":"We had the burrito, nachos, tacos, and the agua de piña. It was very good. The nachos were well dressed and not skimpy. I loved the burrito because it a good proportions inside. This place is great."}
{"text":"Dont recommend them i was enjoying my food even got a menu for catering after getting asked if i was getting the correct menu twice. Guess i look like i cant afford it.  No where!! No where on the menu they have that they charge for refills when i was dining in i assumed they didnt since they also had soda machines. Go ask for refill of fruit water n they want to charge me 1.50 per cup. Just wanted more to drink since they put alot more ice then water. Left my catering menu don't recommend  and for sure i wont be telling my company about this place. Sorry just hate they dont display that they should owner."}
{"text":"For fast food this place is great. I got the carne asada platter and enjoyed it. The service was quick and friendly. They sell a bunch of agua frescas  - I got the pineapple, very good. The place was clean and well laid out. I like being able to see into the kitchen. I would come back when in the area."}
{"text":"First off, I noticed on the door they're closed Sunday's, which I respect and think that's really important to treat your employees good. The lady who assisted us when we first walked in gave us samples of every drink they make fresh and every one was just as delicious as the next. It's clean, the decor is relaxing and a laid back feel. She took her time with us and guided us along with the menu. The food was delicious! Just good basic food. I will defiantly be back to try everything else on the menu!"}
{"text":"We have been trekking across town from Henderson to the Charleston location since the day they opened! Oh happy day that this Desert Inn Rd. Frijoles is now open! We crave this food and tell all we know about this amazingly delicious and authentic food!"}
{"text":"La verdad en los anuncios de  televicion se mira tan bueno todo pero ya probando personalmente esta muy malo no recomendable todo muy desabrido"}
{"text":"One of those hit or miss places I guess looking at these one stars. My burritos are always satisfying, full of meat and no \"air\" lol. One of the few places I like tongue here. Their ceviche is good, small portion but it's cheap too. Elote is meh, but that's probably the only thing that hasn't thrilled me. Staff is friendly and major bonus for having a drive thru. Definitely where I go when I get off work craving Mexican food. Quick, easy and delicious. Their Frescas are great too."}
{"text":"So for a place with frijoles in the name,  they really didn't offer that many bean dishes... in fact there was only one choice and that was side of rice and beans. With that said, the side of beans was delicious.   One thing that I was not aware of is that it is a drive-thru Mexican style restaurant. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but maybe I was expecting more of a hole in the wall, divey taco joint?   The tacos were only ok,  but the agua fresca was fab.  I mean you can't really mess up agua fresca, but I would definitely come back and drive through for another one. Lots of different flavor choices, and fast and accurate service."}
{"text":"Good location, with a convenient drive-tru. I got to say, I am a fan of the big taco, big burrito with beans, rice, condiments section of Tacos shops. My favorite is still the street style tacos that are served with just onions, and cilantro, but the big full tacos at Frijoles are fun to eat. The Aguas Frescas are really tasty, right balanced sweet and flavorful."}
{"text":"Love this place. Extremely good and very clean. Also the workers are very nice and friendly. They let you sample all the frescas drink which are so good. My favorite would have to be the strawberry one yummy . You will not regret coming here."}
{"text":"Ordered two nachos one chicken one steak looks like we ordered nachos with extra brown guacamole and extra pico could not find my chicken nor steak it was there but not much. Ordered one carne asada taco the tortilla was gross and the meat dry"}
{"text":"Great tacos, amazing agua Fresca & the best street corn. Always a great place for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of F&F since day one at their original Charleston location and I'm thrilled to see they've done well enough to open a fourth location! My work schedule has me by one location or another nearly every day of the week and it's hard to stay away on taco Tuesdays. The new drive-thru available makes this even harder, now that it's so fast.  Their asada is consistently smoky and fresh, one of my favorite versions in town, and their al pastor is my second-choice protein. All tacos come with the works, done right with cilantro, onion, and guac, with additional red and green salsa at each table. Sides include chips/salsa (which I wish were included) or rice/beans. Treat yourself to a tasty agua fresca with your meal- and if you can't decide on a flavor, they'll combine them all for you!"}
{"text":"Been driving by this place for a few weeks and decided to give it a try. I ordered a carne Asada salad and my friend ordered nachos. They are both really good.  They didn't ask us what type of beans and just gave us both pinto beans which I don't like.  The salad itself was pretty good but the meat was not as fresh as I'd like. Nachos we're really good and hot. I'll go back and try different meats and the fresh juices."}
{"text":"I love this place! I have been to all their location and they all serve the same delicious food and frescas. This one is the closest to me. My husband ordered the Nacho pastor. Forgot to take a picture on mine lol. I had the burrito combo which came a side of beans and rice. You can get chips and salsa or chips and frijoles with the combo."}
{"text":"The photos they have advertising food is BS I ordered a caene asada burrito with everything, shrimp quesadilla and a shrimp taco. Burrito was like full of air The quesadilla had a little string of cheese  The shrimp taco they should mention it comes with a soft and super hard tortilla Their tables were dirty"}
{"text":"Ordered the carne asada nachos. Most of the nachos were soggy.  The chips were not fresh, and lacking cheese  & sour cream, and the main star of the nachos ,,  minimal carne asada . One thing I did like was the convenient drive thru.  Lol.    Don't think I'll go back."}
{"text":"Muy Rica La Comida!!!! Sus Postres Estan Super Ricos Churros Y Cheese Cake Chimichangas Y Ni Se Diga De Los Elotes Asados"}
{"text":"Love love the atmosphere in the middle of town but always liked this place we've been to the one in the mall twice this location was first time! Love it"}
{"text":"Excelente, muy buena calidad tanto la comida como las aguas frescas.  Un servicio de comida rápida diferente al resto, ingredientes de calidad, estilo moderno, limpio y buen servicio.  Lo recomiendo."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb. Fresh and healthy Mexican food. Very authentic and traditional foods."}
{"text":"I've come to this location 4x; however, only eaten once. Every time I'm in the drive through there's nobody on the headset.   The one time I was able to order I had to drive up to the window. The girl, had a headset on her head. I'm assuming she didn't turn it on.... or just ignored me. She was snippy with me. Made me feel as if it was an inconvenience to take my order.   Why don't you walk in and order? Well why have a drive through if you don't use it! Also, I usually have a sleeping baby in the car.   Food was okay. My steak salad was huge, needs a bit more dressing than they give you. My husband got a steak burrito. It all was very boring tasting. Yet I kept going to give them another chance. I live very close.   In the end, I won't be returning again."}
{"text":"Muy rico sus tacos deliciosos muy limpio recomendable y prueben sus ricos cócteles están deliciosas carne asada Pastor lengua camarones  todo está delicioso"}
{"text":"Riquísimo  se los recomiendo todo delicioso  Sus aguas la quesadilla de camarón todo está delicioso los cócteles las papas de carne"}
{"text":"The concept of the restaurant is good.  Mexican food and aguas frescas.  If you've never been, be prepared to sample their spin on aguas frescas.  They have your tradition horchata but they also have drinks with chia seeds.  It's quite different but tasty.  On my visit I ordered the carne asada nachos and a carne asada taco.  I made the mistake of not asking how their large tacos are prepared.  The taco is more of a folded up quesadilla with carne asada stuffed in the middle.  They add salsa and guac.  If you are a fan of those things, you will enjoy.  I, however, do not enjoy the texture of quesadillas so this was a bit off-putting for me.  The nachos are ok.  They are served with pinto beans (whole, not refried), carne asada, guacamole, sour cream, and salsa.  They taste great to start, but because the beans are too watery they make the chips soggy quickly.  I like my nachos to be crispy.  An improvement would be to serve the toppings on the side as a dip for the chips.  The carne asada I believe is cooked on a flat top so it doesn't get the char that a grill would provide.  Overall, it's decent for a quick lunch and if you know how to order."}
{"text":"Got a taco for $4.50...doesn't matter what kind of meat you get. Kind of expensive for being stuffed with beans. Sandia drink is good. I got the street corn too, took a few bites and threw it away. I probably won't come back since there are so many taco shops around. Also the lady at the front who helped me wasn't very personable. The people behind me got their food before I did."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great prices! We had this catered to us for a work event and when I saw one opened up near my house I just had to go. The food was prepared super quick and even though it looked small from the outside, there was plenty of room to sit and enjoy the food. I got one taco and a side of rice/beans for under $6 and was pleasantly satiated."}
{"text":"I came to frijoles and frescas grilled tacos because i heard it had recently opened and man oh man was it delicious. I NEVER order a drink but how can you not when you come to a place with drinks in its name?!!! i got the cucumber lime chia and a carne asada burrito. Im already looking forward to the next time i can eat here!!!"}
{"text":"To think that I thought Frijoles and Frescas was too upscale for my weekly taco fix.   Desert Inn is unfortunately just far enough away from Charleston and Tropicana which both have amazing taco selections. I thought Frijoles and Frescas could be the answer but it is not. Their building and menu make this place look like a Chipotle or something. We ordered 2 Carne Asada mini tacos, an al pastor burrito, cheese quesadilla and cheese nachos. About the last two.. I made better nachos in a microwave in high school. The cheese burned a hole in the styrofoam container. Probably half the nachos didn't have cheese and the quesadilla was paper thin. The Carne Asada tacos were better.. meat wasn't too fatty. I could get a few of these again if I were desperate. The al pastor burrito wasn't as plump as burritos from any other taco shop nearby. The al pastor flavor was strong, too bad it didn't have any pineapple.   Pretty disappointed in this place. It was the exact opposite of what I thought it was going to be and definitely not worth coming back when there are so many other taco shops to explore."}
{"text":"This is a location that used too have a favorite of mine.  Baja Tacos..... good luck trying to replicate the goodness.....DONE.  Num num yum yum... I will be returning here for certain, Thank you for taking that local spot.... clean cheery staff helpful.. they as well give suggestions for their fresh fruit drinks, i tried a taster but as usual I am a water drinker  all about the food of which I have only one complaint and that is juste my own taste ... street corn is not roasted....once again my own thing but the toppings were spot on.... had burrito and chicken quesadilla with chips and salsa .... could have eaten that salsa all day.... Bravo and will see you soon"}
{"text":"came here for taco tues. that one of the reviewers wrote about. well they don't do taco tues. so try somewhere else.very disappointing."}
{"text":"Came in for a quick bite, and ordered a carnitas taco. I can't say too much about the service since it was a brief exchange but the taco was pretty delicious. The only gripe that I have is the pricing for a single taco, about $5. It definitely didn't fill my appetite but its probably one of the tastiest taco's I've had. Might try a burrito next time I'm there."}
{"text":"Meh. The food is too salty, but the tortillas and the juices are good.  Less salt, more flavor please."}
{"text":"The place is really nice but overall I don't like the food personally everyone has their own opinions though. I think it's way overpriced for cheap beans that you can buy at a grocery store and make yourself. The beans here are probably canned they do not have any good taste to them. The burrito here is about $8 dollars I rather spend that money at chipotle it's cheaper over there. The customer service isn't well either the workers do not say hi when coming in the restaurant or say bye to you. I hate to say this but I don't see myself or my family coming here again. I rather eat at chipotle or Taco Bell for the quality of food."}
{"text":"Frescas? Yesss. Frijoles? Well...not so much.  My friend and I stopped by for lunch and were pleasantly surprised at how nice the interior is for a joint that has a drive-thru. The reclaimed wood, lanterns, and flat screen TVs definitely step them up a notch from most comparable taco shops.  I got the watermelon fresca and it was a treat. That was probably the best part of my meal. You know when you hear a new song on the radio and you shazam it and it becomes your seasonal anthem? That's what a watermelon fresca tastes like. It's my new jam.  I got the chicken quesadilla and sad to say, it was kind of disappointing. I can get a better one elsewhere -- they seem to skimp out on the meats. My friend opted for a burrito, and in the style of a deflated balloon, it tilted toward the scanty side.   I'd be back to try their other frescas, but I'll probably skip the food."}
{"text":"1/27/2018  I was glad to see that there was a new place close to my home and decided to give them a try.  I entered the place and there was about 30 people eating or waiting for their orders.  You order at the counter and you are given a \"beeper\" that alerts you to when your order is ready.  I ordered a beef burrito with a side order of refried beans.  I explicitly said I was hungry for refried beans and would like a large serving.  I also ordered a drink.  My total was $9.00 and change.  I filled my Styrofoam cup from the drink station and picked up my plastic knife and fork.  I was alerted that my order was ready in a reasonable amount of time and when I went to pick up my order, there was a lone burrito in a plastic basket lined with a thin paper and aluminum foil.  I asked where was my refried beans and they said they put them in my burrito.  I explained that wasn't how I ordered it but I would go ahead and accept it the way they fixed it.  My burrito was 90% beans with very little beef and a little sour crème and chopped tomato and onion.  Eating a burrito from a  plastic basket with plastic utensils on a sheet of foil is one of my least favorite ways to eat.  There were two squirt bottles on the table, one with red and the other with green sauce.  I try and give new places the benefit of doubt as I want them to succeed and I struggle with giving negative reviews, but it is what it is.  It's not the places fault but there were 3 different tables where children around the age of 4 or 5 would scream as loud as they could to either get attention or show their displeasure and the parents did little to teach them that behavior was not acceptable in a public place.  I was glad to get out of there quickly as parents not controlling their screaming children is at the top of my least favorite things.  I think that after getting my order wrong, that the  burrito was way over priced,  and serving food in a foil lined basket with plastic utensils, is what I have to say about Frijoles and Frescas."}
{"text":"New location and the food is delicious. Love the tacos. The chicken and shrimp. Licked the plate it was so good. And I can never decide on what flavor drink. So good all of them."}
{"text":"Good food. GREAT DRINKS!!!! Everything is fresh and  delicious. Mix the juices for your own blend. Cucumber+spinach is good!!! I love the strawberry!!!! Fries and salads are available if you aren't feeling the rice and bean combo."}
{"text":"This is a great lunch spot! You know when you walk into a place an it just smells good, like real food, and you know it's going to be good... My friend and I both ordered quesadilla's (one pork and one chicken) and I ordered the watermelon mango Fresca.  The tortilla was a perfect combination of slightly crisp on the outside soft on the inside. They also use a light hand on the cheese which allowed the flavor of the meet and guacamole come through. The hot and mild table sauces were also delicious.  The Fresca was super flavorful and made from real watermelons and mangos.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Foods so nice and no complaint, cashier Michelle was so rude and not even smile,my wife asked her to give extra tortilla and we paid extra for that she deliver only the tortilla comes without foods  Anyway I asked my wife is that enough. she said no I'm waiting for the extra tortilla we ordered, but it never come to us and when I asked Cashier she told me you have to pay so I paid and wait for tortilla so she came to table at that time my wife asked cashier what's happened to the tortilla we extra order And why you made my husband to pay again, so she said let me check and later she delivered 6 tortilla but we already finished eating  PLEASE PAY ATTENTION TO YO CUSTOMER'S ORDERS"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Super delicious food, and their shrimp cocktail is to die for! Their tacos are super delicious, and my husband loves the carne asada platter! I'm addicted to this place! Their refreshments are also super good! My personal favorite was the strawberry."}
{"text":"Love this place.  The frescas are very good.  Enjoyed the different fresh frescas.  The nacía were very good and packed with meat.   The street corn was also delicious.  Tacos are also a good option.   Can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"I've been to one of their other locations on Eastern and was here ghost unsatisfied. I decided to give this place another try, and I am definitely glad I did. The carnitas taco was delicious and the mini quesadilla is an amazingly tasty bite of heaven.  Even their beans here have great flavor. The only thing I was not a huge fan of was the corn, a little bland for having so many components to make it flavorful."}
{"text":"This place has good, fresh Mexican food. I order the chicken salad and everything tasted very well. I was surprised to learn they have a drive-thru!!! This works perfect for anyone on a quick lunch break. The environment inside is very clean and the staff is professional. I definitely want to go back and try the other dishes."}
{"text":"Ok estaba muy emosionadda  que habrieran  Frijoles & frescas por el E. Desert Inn pero que desepsion  en el Drive Thru  esperando que me tomaran la orden  apunto que pense que ya hera tarde que ya estaba serrado.ya me hiba a hir. Tube que rrepetir mi horden  3 beses. Llegue a la bentanilla y bolvi a esperar que tomaran mi pago Mi limonada  creeo que me la dieron Kids size sin hielo  osea que es un tee caliente. No pusieron  cubiertos popte(sorbete) y la cajera nada de amable. Que desepsion."}
{"text":"Average American mexican food. With what we paid to have some tacos and quesadillas I would much rather hit up Del Taco. At a mexican restaurant / taco shop you expect at least good chips, beans and salsa. The only thing I kept eating were the chips.  I'm a mexican food fanatic and I would never ever recommender come here again. Sorry. The staff was fine, nothing bad on their service."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place looked good in the reviews but after I placed my order and I approached the window I was greeted by a rude cashier that not only snatched my card out of my hand she didn't even bother asking me if I wanted a receipt. When food was ready she handed it to me and closed the window on me while I was asking her a question. Waited 5 minutes for her to come back from being on her phone and I was waving at her because she forgot something at my order and decided to wave back and keep ignoring me . I could understand if it was busy but no body was their for her to attend to except be busy on her phone. After she decided to come back I asked her for the salsa I ordered and she said it's in the bag and closed the window again and I know for a fact it's not in there. Food is decent but not great and will not be coming back due to the poor service and lack of fucks given. Chipotle and cafe rio are better hands down then this."}
{"text":"I'm happy they have a new location closer. I love their food. Cashiers are friendly only negative is that they take awhile to get your food and cashiers don't interact with you much so service can be abit faster."}
{"text":"Ironically enough, I'm not a huge fan of their beans OR their juice.   Their tacos, however... a whole different story. Best tacos I've ever had, hands down. Make sure you get the carnitas!"}
{"text":"Oh my God, this place was fantastic. The cashier let us try most all of the Frescas and she even combined a few to see which ones we would like. I chose the strawberry cucumber and my boyfriend had just cucumber, so refreshing and delicious.. I decided to have the mini tacos with steak, I ate two of them they were a 1.99 each and that with my drink was quite enough for me.. my boyfriend had the platter with steak and I believe that was 799 and he loved it, he said the steak was tender and delicious and he loved the beans. We will definitely be back again !!! Very friendly staff and clean place, I don't usually eat any type of Mexican food, but this impressed me."}
{"text":"The photos they have advertising food is a lie I ordered bean cheese burrito cheese nachos Steak quesadilla  Burrito was not full but very watery The nachos had a tiny about of white melted cheese on it The steak quesadilla was very peppery and hardly any steak in it Guacamole was 1/2 teaspoon serving as well as the sour cream inside It was not worth the money The place was dirty tables weren't washed down trash was over flowing The cashier is rude not inexperience also i forgot to mention. they use everything in blasket bins,plastic silverware parents come and bring there kids,and they do scream and yell. there is no control. taco bell is better than here."}
{"text":"Thanks to yelp, we found this awesome new place for some great food. Medium fast food and well worth the trip! Mmmmm"}
{"text":"I was pretty excited about this place because the food was similar to Los Tacos on Charleston and didn't require me to drive very far. With each visit, my experience keeps going downhill. Today we picked up food to go and when we got home, I opened up my tacos that I ordered with no cheese, and guess what? They had cheese. That's not the worst though. My sister opened up her chicken quesadilla and guess what? It had NO cheese! What kind of s*** is that! Definitely not a quesadilla lmao. Luckily we had some shredded cheese at home we were able to add to complete the quesadilla. Ill be probably be back again though for the cravings."}
{"text":"I recently went to their Nellis location and ordered a shrimp cocktail and a soda... a $20 tab.   Upon getting my order, I thought \"f*** yea I'm eating at frijoles again\".  I was let down by the quality of the food. While the service is good. The food however, not so much. Maybe it just wasn't their day? Not sure. It felt as if they threw Pico de Gallo in the cocktail juice.  The acidic taste from the Pico de Gallo and the the cocktail juice don't go together! Specially when Pico is sitting in their cold serv table.  The shrimp had a bland taste.  To top it off there wasn't enough avocado in the cocktail.   Not sure, I would come back to this place to spend another $20 on a shrimp cocktail."}
{"text":"I'm so glad they opened the one on eastern and desert inn. Now I can get my tacos and fresh water fix much more frequent.   I've tried the salad, tacos, and quesadillas. I would definitely recommend either shrimp tacos or shrimp/carne asada quesadilla.   For the drinks you can ask for a sample and figure which one you like the most. You can also mix flavors. Mango strawberry mix is delicious and refreshing."}
{"text":"So surprised. The best Mexican food I have had in a long time. The fresh fruit drinks sooooo refreshing. I had a tostada with my choice of meat and the tortilla was one that I have not tasted. I have more items to try so I will go back."}
{"text":"Tacoss, ensaladas, burritos deliciosos!! No se diga las aguas frecas y las chimi!! Excelente servicio 100% recomendable"}
{"text":"So glad they opened one on the East side. Not far from my work, my friends and I go for lunch at least twice a week. Haven't had a bad meal yet. Love the ceviche and Carne asada burrito."}
{"text":"This location is one of the worst I've been to. First of all, we've gone thru the drive thru once and an older very slim looking woman had caught an attitude because I didn't have my ID with me cause my boyfriend was driving his car and we just brought my card. Now the reason why that is putting me off is because a friend of mine went inside like a week later the same woman with a bad attitude again took her card without asking for an ID. Then both times they've completely messed up the order. How hard is it to know not to put sour cream , or even not put rice and beans as well. This is the closest one to our friends place. This post is going on any review spot for this location that I can. I live on the Southwest normally and go to the one off Rainbow and Trop. That locations always been great and FRIENDLY."}
{"text":"Straight to the point, carne asada nachos with black guacamole and not enough carne asada... carne asada burrito with no flavor.... Taco bell has better flavor and the funny part is that i dont even like taco bell... this location has bad food!"}
{"text":"One of the few places where pastor actually DO taste like pastor! Really good tacos, delicious pastor and carnitas, and real aguas frescas! Found my new fave taco place!"}
{"text":"If I was rating the Fresca alone, I would totally give this place 5 stars. Sadly, the experience at Frijoles & Frescas was only subpar.   They had popped up in my Hot & New businesses, so I bookmarked it as a must try. I'm all about trying new things, and when one of my friends said she was craving beans, it only made sense to go here. We went through the drive-thru and ordered at the speaker. The menu is easy to read and full of options from tacos to street corn, and burritos to salad. I ordered the Pineapple Fresca which was cold and refreshingly sweet. I also tried the Strawberry which had small chunks of berry and seeds and wasn't overly sweet, but maintained the full flavor of the delicious fruit.  What was disappointing was the Carnitas Burrito. It was loosely wrapped and had minimal chunks of meat. I love my carnitas a bit on the crispier side, and although the pork was full of flavor, the texture was soft, which made the whole burrito a bit of a mess to eat."}
{"text":"Two stars because i order 4 tacos they never told me they are big also they look like a salad taco so much sour cream not homemade guacamole and just a little very greasy meat very disappointed cant even taste anything. And cant even take home because you cant reheat this tacos"}
