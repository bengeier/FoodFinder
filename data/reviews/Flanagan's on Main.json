{"text":"I have eaten at Flanagans on many occasions and absolutely love it!! The staff are wonderful..a great beer selection..would definitely return..."}
{"text":"We love this pub!!!! A relaxing place to have a drink. The menu is a little limited but the food is great!  The staff is super friendly."}
{"text":"Our server this evening was overly nice, but not especially good at her job. The owner was neither good at her job nor nice, which from experience, at least one of those things is necessary for success in this industry, or any... This owner was rude and condescending to everyone in the party of 7 that I was with. 
One of our orders (cheese fries) came out late and was wrong, but when we asked to keep it despite the mistake because we thought it would go to waste, she responded by telling us that we couldn't without paying. We asked what she was going to do with the plate - we've all known a lot of food to be thrown out after being sent back from a table - and she told us she was going to eat it... 
When the next attempt of this order came to the table, they were ice cold in the center! (How hard is it to make cheese fries?!) 
We can understand mistakes with food but the way she acted and treated us was just intolerable. She didn't apologize for anything and seemed to blame us for our own poor taste when we commented or asked about anything. 
This kind of treatment and food quality does not a good business make. I had no intention of disliking this evening and hate to even post this negativity, but I do so because I believe there is someone who can do something to prevent future customers from being so very upset after what is supposed to be a friendly night out with the family."}
{"text":"Our spinach salads were brought to us missing both the goat cheese and the bacon. Sent them back and they returned with just the cheese. Whatever, we mentioned it again to our terrible server who blandly apologized. Beer spilled on us twice. No adjustment to the bill for being served unfinished food. The salads were $8 each and passed off as entrees when they were barely a side salad. Another server came over to refill our waters because I guess ours couldn't be bothered. Other than a nice patio there's no reason to visit."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Flannigans and I was not impressed. 
First off, the decor was not what you would expect for an Irish Pub. The ceilings are high and it feels more like a bistro than a pub. Our waitress was kind of snotty. We had a party of 12 so there was a lot of talking among us but if she came up to the table and we didn't stop talking she would glare. She was also very rude when it came to ordering. She would either just look at you or ask \"you?\" Also, I ordered the fish and chips which comes with cole slaw and asked for no cole slaw. I was told that it was a very small portion so there was no point in taking it off. 
The food was... ok. We started out with the onion rings and mac and cheese bites. The onion rings weren't anything special but the sauce it came with tasted pretty bad. The mac and cheese bites were good but they tasted a lot like Kraft brand. The menu is small so most people at the table got either the Guinness burger, fish and chips, Shepard's pie or bangers and mash. I had the fish and chips and the fries were hard and cold and the fish was very greasy. I understand it's fried but it seemed excessive compared to other fish and chips I've had. My boyfriend's burger was over cooked (asked for it medium rare and it was well done) and his fries were cold as well. The bangers were small and the mash had no flavor whatsoever. I didn't taste the Shepard's pie but I was told it was bland as well.
Overall, the food is greasy, overcooked or cold. I will not be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"I've been twice to Flannigans and both times was very pleased. The appetizers are superb, especially the lamb sliders. I had the shepherds pie and my husband had the fish and chips, both excellent. Even the kids loved the Mac and cheese. We will definitely keep going!"}
{"text":"I am not sure WHERE the other reviewers went, but it definitely was not the same Pub I went to... (And I go to A LOT of Pubs). Given the joint has only been open for two months at this point, so maybe you hit them at opening?

Came in, Hostess was great (name was Nirvana), and wait staff was awesome. The bartender understood exactly what I meant by a proper pour of Guinness, and delivered on the spot. Food rivaled, is not beat Ri Ra's un Uptown Charlotte and the scotch egg was one of the best I have had. I had the Sheppard's pie and my wife had the fish and chips and both were spot on. The other two couples with us were also very happy with their meals. We then moved from inside to the patio (without having to change checks or wait staff), and continued the libations while we listened to the band play that was booked for the night...

Great Night, Great atmosphere, will DEFINITELY be back for more...  

I am Scottish, I love Guinness, and grew up on traditional Scotch-Irish food. It is great to finally have somewhere close to home and not have to drive to CLT for good food and a proper pour of Guinness..."}
{"text":"We have eaten there twice and I have come up with the same conclusions; the food is just average at best. The fish and chips are over battered and the burger is well... just not what you would think and Irish pub would hang its hat on. The spinach salad looked like it came from a bag at the HT with cold dressing.  Tasteless 

Looks like I am in the minority when I read the reviews but the folks in Harrisburg deserve better."}
{"text":"No idea what all the bad reviews are about. It takes time for a place to truly establish itself and Flanagan's is well on its way. This is my second visit. The shepherd's pie was great the first go round and the pork chops equally as good this time. Chef let us try the scotch egg on the house and it was phenomenal. This isn't your typical \"bar\" or \"pub\" fare, but if you're looking for that, go elsewhere. High quality ingredients and a knowledgeable chef = good food. Give them time to weed out questionable serving staff and this place will be A+"}
{"text":"Parents came here a couple times when it first opened. They said the service was bad and the food was bland. After hearing about the new ownership/management we decided to give it another shot. And me and parents were both extremely impressed with the newly managed place. The food was absolutely amazing and service was also incredible. I highly recommend this restaurant to anybody in the surrounding area."}
{"text":"Nice patio, pet friendly, good staff and great atmosphere. The food is ok and the lamb sliders are great!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Food is so good and they are very reasonably priced. Will be a fan for lice. Will be back again very soon!"}
{"text":"I've only eaten here a few times but I can tell you that the chicken is great. Mostly I come for the pub. The beer is cold the service and atmosphere is great and the absolute best part is... They have Murphy's beer!!!  Every true Irish pub should have Murphy's!"}
{"text":"Ordered the sausages with mash potato. The dish came out cold. The sausages tasted funny and bland. The mash potato tasted like grocery store box made. I should have trusted my instincts not to eat but I didn't. Got home and spent the night with food poisoning...throwing up and on the toilet. Fever hit shortly after. Will never go there again."}
{"text":"Great bartender! Keeps use entertained and feel welcome. Great beer selections too! Really laid back atmosphere."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews I was not sure if we would be better off trying somewhere different, but the 43 mile drive was well worth it. I saw the name, and new we had to try it out, being a Flanagan too. The environment was awesome, the staff was extremely attentive, and lots of fun, and the food was quite good. I did find the beers to be a little more pricey than I thought they should be, but that will not stop me from going back again. It was well worth the time, and the drive."}
{"text":"Our group tonight loved the corned beef & cabbage, fish n chips and Irish creamed chicken.   Yum!!!!!  !!!"}
{"text":"The best Bartender and Chef ever!! Cheers to Tica & Dee!! Love this place!! Love hanging out at Flanagans with my Friends!!"}
{"text":"Great food and drinks!  Had the Scotch Egg and the Irish Cream Chicken, delicious!  Staff was very friendly and service was great!"}
{"text":"Surprised at how much we like it... the location is a little hidden, you probably wont just drive by. The menu was a little limited but had some great options. We got the pretzel appetizer, they were deep fried with great beer cheese. I got a cheese burger, it was great and they cooked it perfectly medium. My husband got Bangers and Mash (sausage and mashed potatoes), he really liked it, although the portion wasnt quite enough for my big eatter. The atmosphere was pretty chill, not a ton of seatting but they have a cool little patio with cornhole. They have 2 booths in the corner that have little tvs in the booth - my husband loved that, watched football! Waitress was super nice and attentive. If you want a chill drinking spot, beers are like $2, martinis are $5 and they had some alcohol icecream and coffee drinks that sounded good but we didnt try it!"}
{"text":"First time Flannigans visitor.
It is a Clean and tidy place with nice
Decor and a mixture of average and above average food.  Service was friendly, but VERY slow as there was only 1 server for all the tables inside and out.
  Our table had for appetizers a Scotch Egg and fried Mac n cheese.  WOW the scotch egg was very very good even though I would say it's $7.00 price tag was a little steep.  Fried mac n cheese was typical as anywhere else, nothing special.
   Entrees for the table were sheppards pie, bangers and mash, Guinness BBQ cheeseburger and Irish Cream chicken.  Hey, if your gonna order food at an Irish place, it better be Irish food is our thinking.   Sheppards pie was well seasoned and had a good flavor and portion size.  Bangers and mash, not so much, no garlic in the garlic mash potatoes and entire dish was very dry and boring.  Small portion for the price too.
  Guinness BBQ cheeseburger was quite the opposite, very large portion, flavorful and a big portion for the price.  Only downside here was the odd tasting soggy fries.  The hit of the table was the Irish Cream Chicken, very tasty, but once again, a small portion compared to the price tag.
   SO ..... All in all, Flannigans gets 3 stars.  Hit and miss Irish food, an almost non existent server (although very friendly when she was tending to our table), and small portion sizes.
   Nice patio with plenty of room, but if you are a non smoker, just be aware of the people around you as the patio normally has a big number or smokers for obvious reasons.
  I really wanted to like this place a lot, however 3 stars is not a deal breaker for me.  I will give it a few weeks and then go back again and see if things are any better or improved."}
{"text":"Over-priced, mediocre food that gave me diarrhea --Poor service -- and the owner was a TOTAL BIT** who did not care one bit about pleasing her customers.
We left enraged with the way we were treated and flabbergasted at the amount we paid."}
{"text":"This was actually our second time here, our first time was very soon after they opened and we weren't real impressed with the food we received and haven't been back since until recently.  We were really looking forward to some Irish pub fare and didn't want to drive into Charlotte so we gave them another shot to see if anything has changed.   

The food was better, their special was the Fish & Chips and that is what I ordered and others at the table had the appetizer sampler and their Bangers and Mash.  The fish was great, battered just as you would expect and cooked right and three large pieces, the chips (fries) were great too, I believe hand cut but the portion size of the chips was not much.  I would have rather had 2 pieces of the fish and more chips, but I get you can't please everyone, just a personal preference to note, and it was fair priced for the amount of food.  The sampler was good, we thought the Cod Croquettes were really good although we didn't care for the sauce suggested with them.  The Skins were typical and OK.  The Bangers and Mash were OK, if anything a little bland for the sausage but still good.  

Service, well I almost hate to write about service because I think the manager or maybe owner was also the server and hostess and I don't know if they have other hired staff, if not they definitely need to hire help.  We came early for dinner so we were paid attention to right away and she was very friendly.  However as the evening went on they got a bit more busy and there was no more help, so she was waiting on all these tables by herself and  service was a bit slow, especially when we were finished and waiting for either to be told the deserts (which they only had one available) or the check.  So not saying service was bad at all but I think they need more help.  I think I probably would have given 4 stars if service was more attentive.  

Three stars for us is OK for us, and we will probably return when wanting the same type of food and not wanting to travel into downtown."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and I haven't been disappointed once! Their food is amazing! They are also dog friendly...we bring the pups up to sit on the patio. The beer and spirits selection is really good as well. 
This has been an excellent addition to the Harrisburg town center! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here a few weeks ago, and recently I got a takeout to try the shepherd's pie. I had the creamed chicken which was very tender and tasty and sides were great! Husband loved his fish and chips--fish not over cooked like in some places and fries handcut with skin on--we both thought it was great.  I mostly got the shepherd's pie for my son, but once I had a bite, I almost couldn't stop eating it!! As far as the price, I haven't been in any decent restaurant where prices are low, have you?? Food prices are high everywhere.  And the waitstaff/manager/bar keep ALL were extremely nice and attentive. Since we had such a great experience, I wanted to give them thumbs up!!"}
