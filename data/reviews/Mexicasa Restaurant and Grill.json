{"text":"I brought my family of five to the restraunt  because of an ad that kids eat free. The waiter didn't explain that drinks had to be ordered to get the deal (nor was it on any of the posted ads). Our bill came with a different ad explaining the restrictions. We were charged full price, and left we the explanation that \"rules are rules.\" They were complete jerks and were happier following the \"rules\" instead of losing out on two drink orders to keep my family's business. Oh, the food isn't much better."}
{"text":"Really good food.  A bit upper class type of Mexican cuisine.  Bit pricy for Mexican faire.  Nice ambiance."}
{"text":"Great Street tacos, great service, great selection! I would recommend Mexicasa to anyone looking for a great Mexican food joint."}
{"text":"Very nice local restaurant.  My husband and I wanted to try something new and different, well I should say I wanted to try something out of he norm, he pretty much likes to stick to what he knows.  So, when he agreed to try it out I was hoping that it would be good and they didn't disappoint.  To start off the atmosphere was very casual.  It was a Friday afternoon and they had natural light coming in and no lights on inside, not sure if it was part of them adding to the atmosphere or saving on energy but none the less it worked.  For lunch we had tortilla chips and salsa for appetizer, fat burrito for the meal and for a drink a Jamaica.  The tortilla chips were very good, definitely taste fresh and homemade, the salsa was just ok, a little too watery and could have used a little more flavor.  The burrito also taste homemade, fresh and it was a good size.  It was a little hard to handle but really not an issue, I was able to inhale the whole thing.  The Jamaica drink was very good.  The waitress told me in Mexico they call it \"water with flavor\"...I call it sorrel with sugar...it was good.    The service was great.  The waitress was beyond sweet, very patient, explained the menu and I learned a little about Mexico.  Overall great experience.  Our total bill was less than $20, that's enough to make anybody happy for tasty food.  I was pleased and so was the hubby.  The only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because although the food was very good it was not a WOW factor.  It taste like something I can try to replicate at home.  I would recommend this place to family and friends as a very nice local restaurant to check out."}
{"text":"Our food took forever to arrive. The waitress was not attentive (pretty sure she forgot to put in our order). The food was just ok. I doubt we'll go back."}
{"text":"Great service.  Delicious food.  Run by a staff who always seem happy to see you.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The gang at mexi casa treat you like family. Mario makes the best margarita around. I travel all over the country and love mexican food. I can eat it all week in the south west and when I get home I have to go here. There is nothing that beats the food or the people."}
{"text":"It took us a little while to get seated, but the food was amazing and the service was TOP NOTCH!  Great price for all the food we got, too!"}
{"text":"Margarita....check Cheese dip....check Kabobs....check Taco salad....not so much Staff....check for courtesy and politeness, not so much for attention to detail. One item we ordered never came and they never realized it. They were very busy and so we will come back because we feel the food is very good on the whole."}
{"text":"My husband and I are a HUGE fan of the food and margaritas at Mexicasa.....I think I should explain why I only rate this restraurant 3 stars....lack of consistency. We would rate their food and margaritas 5 stars when the restraurant is not busy. However, when it is busy, the food is just ok and the margaritas don't have ANY tequila in them. The staff is always very grateful for our business and that's what keeps us going back....we do only go during non-peak hours now and that will guarentee a great experience for us."}
{"text":"As a native Californian, I'm super picky about my Mexican food. At a bare minimum, I expect: actual salsa, not ketchup masquerading as salsa; guacamole that is something other than an avocado paste; beans that don't taste like they came from a can; margaritas that contain tequila; and my server must know the difference between carnitas and carne asada. (This last one is a new requirement based on visit to a different Mexican restaurant in North Carolina.)  Mexicasa hit all the marks. The beans, rice, guacamole and margaritas were great. The salsa could have been spicier, but was good nonetheless. The chicken in the chicken enchilada was a but dry, but still good. The beef in the beef enchilada was ground, not shredded, but still very tasty. They do offer shredded beef in the menu, so that maybe an option if requested.   The boyfriend ordered Arroz con Pollo. It was delicious and a huge portion.   They were very busy when we were there, so the service was a little slow, but not too bad, and the servers were very attentive. I will definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"Authentic mexican at its best.  Armando is the owner who creates a kid friendly, casual restaurant and serves excellent food.  We've been going there for years and have NEVER had a bad experience with the food, price or service.  I always get the Texas Burrito, which has chicken, steak and shrimp.  It feeds me for two days.  The street tacos are fairly new and are awesome!  We've tried most of the mexican restaurants in the Charlotte area and Mexicasa tops the list!"}
{"text":"Wonderful and wonderful service!  Iam a huge fan of mexican cuisine so this is one of my favorite places to gather with family and friends."}
{"text":"Just okay. I order the usual dish that I order from every Mexican restaurant-burrito and enchilada combo. It was just ok. Very very bland. The salsa is way to spicy. My son usually loves all Mexican rice but he refused to eat the rice. Probably will not come back. Very sweet family owns the restaurant. I do love the kids eat free on Saturdays promo but I rather have better food."}
{"text":"Everything I've eaten there has been great...but the one dish that stands out above all others is the Sopa de Marina...A hearty seafood stew...It is really hard to put into words all the flavors that go into dish. It's a thin tomato/seafood broth, w/ nothing but seafood...Shrimp, scallops, fish, calamari, etc...A squeeze of line and you set. If you like seafood, you MUST try this dish...The staff is always great."}
{"text":"On the upside... The sweet tea is very good.. Almost perfect. After that... BLAND.  Nothing extraordinary.  Bland is the best word that I can think of to describe this place.  Not to mention, the chips are cold.  My plate actually looked like something from a box of Marie Calendars.  The service was just so-so. There were only 4 tables of guests.... Our tea glasses were rarely filled.  Be weary of eating here... There's a Taco Bell just down the road... Probably better value."}
{"text":"Well I walked it all cheery and happy to pick up my food and bring it home to devour. Well as I walk in 2 people are standing at the bar and I hear them use an expletive to describe me...mind you I'm 9 months pregnant.   I was irate and asked them why they said that. The guy said it wasn't him it was he co worker ...anyhow I told them how I felt and vowed to never return and I ask you to also not eat there. Nothing worse than men calling a customer names. I can't help that I have a huge belly you bastards in brewing 2 humans what have you 2 done lately???  Disgusting."}
{"text":"I have been here on a few occasions for work functions for my husband. Every time I am very disappointed in the food. There are much better Mexican restaurants around the Charlotte area and are worth the drive. I would not recommend this one."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. They have the best queso I have ever had and really great food. Service is always great also. One of the servers always knows what we want when we come in. :)"}
{"text":"This place is decent. They have good queso and good acp but the service sucks. We had to ask for refills when our glasses were empty. It took forever to get a refill. Some things you just shouldn't have to ask for."}
{"text":"The service is horrible!  When you have to track down silverware to eat your less then good meal or get your own beverage I'm thinking there is something wrong. The food is bland, inconsistent, and hardly authentic Mexican cuisine. Biggest pet peeve--having to darn near tackle the server for the ticket to pay. Was ready to just get up and leave!  Seriously??  If it were busy I could understand. It wasn't busy--maybe 4 tables. I definitely will not return. Taco Bell is a heck of a lot better in my opinion!!!"}
{"text":"This is typical American-Mexican food.  Many items are thrown into the microwave for heating (cooking). I sat in direct view of the kitchen. I will agree that the food is good, not great, although my take out order was missing the black beans. Take out is charged an additional .50 on your order. So if you're going to charge more for take out make sure everything is included in the order. Also, portions much smaller on take out."}
{"text":"Always quick service. Great staff. Good food for what it is. Salsa, margaritas - great. Kids menu could use some beefing up and would love to see a grilled veggie and shrimp or chicken dinner."}
{"text":"Any other Mexican restaurant. Service slow. Food under or over cooked. Still gives the gas or the shits. This is as same for all typical Mexican food."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore Mexicasa.  We've been going there since it opened.  For starters, the salsa is spicy - I abhor going out for Mexican and getting wimpy salsa.  They also offer cheese dip and guacamole on the appetizer menu, and both are worth a try. I have tried just about everything on this menu, and I have found nothing that I do not like!  The seven layer burrito is my absolute favorite.  I especially like that they will adjust ingredients per your request.  Super service, great people, and really fast take-out service!"}
{"text":"The best Mexican restaurant!  You won't find the grease covered, premade slop here. Everything is fresh and delicious!    I absolutely LOVE the street tacos. They are a new addition to the menu and I can't have enough of them!    If you are in Harrisburg, this is the BEST choice around by far!"}
{"text":"We had some friends visiting from out of town one night who wanted to meet us there. Since it's constantly being raved about by the locals, and it's not too far from home, I had no problems trying them out. Might as well see if the other Mexican place in town is good as well, right? Yeah, I was not impressed. We were stuck in a corner and practically ignored all night. My husband and I both ordered steaks, which were pretty bland. Everything just kinda felt like it had been pre-made ahead of time, then stuck in a microwave and heated up. Mine was supposed to come with tortillas, yet I was never asked my preference between corn or flour, and never brought tortillas. Even though my meal was presented in a way that would have benefited from the tortillas. We were also never offered proper knives, and with no waiter in sight, we were forced to eat our steaks with butter knives. You likely won't see me back there any time soon. Which is disappointing. I really wanted to like this place."}
{"text":"Visit Date 3/23/18  I so forgot to take photos of my food. I order the shrimp chimichanga IT WAS REALLY GOOD! The vegetables and shrimp had a grill taste and with a really good flavor and the white cheese sauce on top (SO GOOD). It came with rice and black beans. The black beans did not have a lot of taste. The rice was super dry, I actually did not even eat the rice. The chips was regular tasting nothing fancy.   The staff was busy and I did feel a little rushed. They was nice but rushing. Inside there is one TV by the bar area. The bar is small might hold 6 people at the bar. 4 table and chairs for outside."}
{"text":"Have eaten here in the past and the food was good, not so much tonight. The chips tasted stale and the food was flavorless. Don't know if it was an off night or not, but I will try another place before returning."}
{"text":"MEXICASA IS THE BEST MEXICAN RESTAURANT IN THE WORLD. Except for Casa Grande."}
{"text":"Not in our typical neck of the woods, but we decided to go out to eat on our way to a show, and this is one of the places that came up as a possible option.  The location was a bit of a challenge to find, since you have to get into the parking lot, then double back a bit, but it is not all that bad.  Once inside, the staff is friendly and quick to fill the chips and drinks.  Menu items are fairly typical for your Mexican restaurant, and the plates are well-filled.  Food is similar to many of the other restaurants of this caliber around town - not your authentic variety, but it will certainly do in a pinch."}
{"text":"This was the most I have paid for Mexican and the worst service I have received during. We got our own silverware and refills as needed. With the place being 80' long he must have been swamped, yeah...I accidentally ended here looking for La unica across the street, might I add much higher rated can I add. The chicken in the \"super combo\" was shredded very thin, think cat food consistency. After trying 2 of the 5 things in the meal I gave up. I won't be back for sure. NASTY..."}
{"text":"My go to Mexican restaurant- I love the chicken soup! Great chips and salsa, wonderful specials, decent prices and a friendly staff. Good margaritas"}
{"text":"First let me start of saying this is the first 1 star review I have given, and the only other two star I gave for a food place was because of horrible service.  This one the service was about a 3.5 stars but the food, the food, OMG it was as horrible as it gets.  My wife and I have never had worse.    I will say we both got different kinds of steaks, not normally what we get at a Mexican restaurant but they were on special so we decided to try it.  This place has no business cooking steaks in my opinion.  They never asked how we like our steaks and they came out extremely overcooked and dry.  Without A1 I couldn't have even gotten it down, and I always taste a couple bites before asking for steak sauce.  My wife's was the same, and she couldn't even finish hers.  Also I would think one would expect a Mexican steak to have some type of seasoning, but absolutely nothing, so it was also the blandest steak I have ever had a restaurant.    My special also came with shrimp, again horrible, the shrimp was not even deveined, had no seasoning and was extremely dry.  In hind sight I wish I had taken a picture of my plate because you could see just how plain everything was, no garnishment whatsoever.    The salsa was thinner than tomato soup and really not that much of a taste, and the chips were not at all fresh chips that one would expect in a sit down Mexican restaurant.    Really the only reason for even one star is my daughter did like her rice and black beans and the server was OK."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd visit and 1st review. The girls and I enjoy an authentic Mexican meal! The girls split the Wednesday dinner special - enchiladas with beans and rice. I ate a side of guacamole with my refried beans! Absolutely delicious! Everything was fresh and make to order! The service was quick and the staff is very friendly! This is a definite repeat, kid friendly dinner spot! I love Mexican food and I love this place!"}
{"text":"Mexican food that is almost as good as border town food.  Having lived in San Diego, we were really spoiled regarding Mexican food, and have been sorely disappointed many times.  When we moved to Harrisburg, we noticed Mexicasa and one night my daughter and I decided to give it a try.    The staff was very friendly and helpful, and the food was superb!  Probably the best we've had since leaving San Diego.  I convinced my very picky husband to join me on my next trip, and it's become a staple in our take-out and eating out rotation.    In addition to having actual flavor, and authentic Mexican taste, the food is reasonably priced and very generous portions.  The Super Combo is something ridiculous like $12 and takes 2 takeout boxes to carry it, and will feed a grown man for 2 - 3 meals.    I definitely recommend this to friends."}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant I've been to!!! This place is way better then your typical Mexican restaurant.  They need help with the service though. Service was slow and very \"hairy\" feeling, maybe they were understaffed. Other then that great spot."}
{"text":"Mexican is always our go-to kind of restaurant. My husband and I have tried em all in the university area and thought we'd go a little crazy tonight and try a spot in Harrisburg. Glad we did! Had steak fajitas and steak mexicasa.  Both were delicious. The menu was great, lots of options that arent on your typical mexican restaurant menu. Prices were less expensive than the norm. We are already excited about our next night out here."}
{"text":"Don't bother. Used to be good but not any more. Tonight they were obviously having problems. Waited 45 minutes for food after ordering. No apology. No explanation. Never going back. Too many good places around that actually care about their customers."}
{"text":"We have visited this place many times and we tend to keep our money in the area.   Overall: Meh, the food was just bland if you got tacos- nothing really special about this place. It could be so much more, I think some flavor to the food would be a good start. My husband and I have gotten so many types of variety of food here and we are just not impressed but we try to give it another try.  The service is NOT the best in the world. There would be times we would wait for over 10 minutes for someone for the love of God just to bring us our check. That is one of my key things with restaurant. They are here to make sure we enjoy the food and they are on top of things.  They did not deliver and two weeks ago was the last time we go there.   Just be prepared to wait for everything. You are on their time."}
{"text":"Good, inexpensive, and authentic Mexican food in Harrisburg! The pollo fundido is one of my faves and I hear the chicken soup is great, too."}
{"text":"Margaritas are good and a fair price!  The food is nothing special but it wasn't bad either.   Server was friendly but not too attentive.   Their hours suck."}
{"text":"The 4 Stars drew me in but unfortunately it was a let down. Like many of the other reviews the best word to describe the food is BLAND. There's just no taste. Salsa is bland, cheese dip is bland, chips are bland and on the verge of stale...just not very good. The only redeeming factor is the margaritas are good and service is good. Probably wouldn't want to return."}
{"text":"Well I stopped in because I saw the 4 1/2 star rating which is hard to obtain, BUT the Enchilada and Taco plate I ate was surprisingly Bland with a capital \"B\".  The chicken was possibly just boiled in a lot of water with little to no seasoning.  I saw no evidence of vegetable seasoning either, such as onion or cilantro throughout the chicken.  The salsa was not seasoned very well either and was watery.  It almost tasted just like the glass of water I had.    I will say this; the service was fast and attentive  Thank goodness the food was inexpensive or I would have been mad as all get out."}
